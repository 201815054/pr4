Japan's defense ministry said that its maritime forces had so far rescued one of the seven Marines who were aboard the two aircraft at the time of the incident. Search and rescue efforts were ongoing, U.S. and Japanese officials said.
The rescued person had been on the F/A-18 Hornet fighter jet, and was a in stable condition at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japanese Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya told a news conference. 
The incident adds to a lengthening list of U.S. military aviation accidents around the world in recent years, prompting hearings in Congress to address the rise. 
The Military Times reported earlier this year that aviation accidents jumped nearly 40 percent from fiscal years 2013 to 2017. At least 133 service members were killed in those incidents, it said.
U.S. military accidents are a sensitive topic in Japan, particularly for residents of the southern prefecture of Okinawa, which is home to the bulk of the U.S. presence in the country. A series of emergency landings and parts falling from U.S. military aircraft have highlighted safety concerns.
""The incident is regrettable, but our focus at the moment is on search and rescue,"" he said. ""Japan will respond appropriately once the details of the incident are uncovered.""
The Marine Corps said in a statement the incident occurred around 2 a.m. local time in Japan (1700 GMT Wednesday) about 200 miles (322 km) off the Japanese coast.
The F/A-18 and the KC-130 Hercules refueling aircraft had launched from Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni and were conducting regular training when there was a ""mishap,"" the Marine Corps said.
The Marine Corps did not elaborate on the nature of the incident. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it occurred during a refueling exercise.
Officials who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity were unsure precisely how the mishap occurred but none suspected foul play. An investigation has begun.
The Marine Corps suggested Japanese search and rescue aircraft had taken the lead on the rescue mission. 

""We are thankful for the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force's efforts as they immediately responded in the search and rescue operation,"" it said.

DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh summoned the Myanmar ambassador on Wednesday to condemn “irresponsible remarks” made by Myanmar’s religion minister about Rohingya Muslims, and called for action against him, senior officials at the Bangladesh foreign ministry said.
Rohingya Muslims living as refugees in Bangladesh after escaping Myanmar are being “brainwashed” into “marching” on the Buddhist-majority nation, Myanmar’s religion minister Thura Aung Ko said in a video released by the news website NewsWatch.
“We strongly protest their minister’s provocative remarks. It also hurt Muslim sentiments,” a senior official in the Bangladesh foreign ministry told Reuters on Thursday. 
Condemning the comments about “marching on Myanmar”, he said: “We have zero tolerance toward militancy. We have never encouraged radicalism.”
“If you give them citizenship and their property back, they will run for Myanmar. Instead of doing that, you are making provocative statements? This is unfortunate,” the official said.
More than 730,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar’s Rakhine state in the wake of a brutal army crackdown last August, U.N. agencies say, and are now living in crowded Bangladeshi refugee camps.
U.N. investigators have accused Myanmar soldiers of carrying out mass killings, rapes and burning hundreds of villages with ""genocidal intent"". Myanmar denies most of the allegations. 
When Bangladesh summoned Myanmar ambassador U Lwin Oo, he “tried to dilute the comments by saying they were the religion minister’s personal opinion,” said an official at the Bangladesh foreign ministry who was present at the meeting. “But we asked for action against the minister.”
The religion minister’s comments come as both countries have been engaged in negotiations for more than a year to repatriate the Rohingya to Myanmar, often blaming each other for delays in the process.

The latest plan was scuppered last month after no refugees agreed to return, saying they wouldn’t go back unless Myanmar met a series of demands, chiefly granting them citizenship rights.

2,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2018 09:51PM ET</span>","Aging Japan: Neighboring suburbs face divergent futures as one grays, one grows","By Elaine Lies
SAKURA/INZAI, Japan (Reuters) - Katsuya Kodama's wife died two years ago, and the 77-year-old keeps her ashes on a Buddhist altar in their suburban Tokyo home.
""I talk to her morning and night, tell her everything,"" he said. ""I sit on the chair she used in the bath while ill. Sitting where she sat makes me feel close to her.""
That sense of loss cuts through Sakura, including the Sennari district where Kodama moved 30 years ago. 
Back then, it was filled with young families; now, nearly half of Sennari's residents are over 65 and the population of Sakura, a city of 175,000, is falling by about 400 a year.
The next town over is the more youthful Inzai, where life is much different. Only about 21 percent of its population of 100,600 is older than 65 - 12 percent below Sakura as a whole and almost 7 percent below the national average - and it is buzzing with new development. 
Like Sakura, Inzai lies within commuting distance of Tokyo, roughly an hour west by train, and Narita airport, about 40 minutes east. Both cities sprawl across a mix of developed and open land, prime for growth.
But the demographics of the two cities underline their divergent fortunes. 
Inzai will still be growing in 2040, government forecasts say, while Sakura is set to shrink by up to 20 percent. Japan's population is predicted to decline by 16 percent in the same period.
The key difference: Inzai was redeveloped starting in the mid-1980s with young families in mind. Its mayor enthusiastically lobbied national and regional governments to bring in a major housing project called Chiba Newtown. As it grew, Inzai dangled entertainment complexes and parks to lure residents, with tax breaks for employers.
Sakura has by contrast grown in the more piecemeal fashion typical of other Japanese cities, with little thought given to bringing in new blood. Residents say its government, controlled by one political party since 1955, allowed local stores to fold and did not attract new businesses.
As Japan ages and its population shrinks, Sakura and Inzai illustrate what its cities must do to survive and deal with the rising costs of caring for elderly residents.
Hideki Kobayashi, a professor of city planning at Chiba University, said it was crucial to attract young people with amenities and convenience – like Inzai – or offer sweeteners like tax breaks and guaranteed daycare.
""The population of young people is falling all over Japan, so it becomes a fight for them,"" he said. ""There will be winners and losers, forcing local governments into competition. The places that make efforts to win will see growth.""
CONVENIENT AND NEW
For Shota and Kanako Hagiwara, Inzai represented a new and convenient place to raise their two active boys.
""It's really spread out and easy to live in,"" said Shota, 36, who works for an airline at Narita airport. ""It's new, and looks as if it'll flourish for some time.""
Chiba Newtown - greater Tokyo's third-oldest major housing development - sprawls into Inzai and two other suburbs.
Though parts of Inzai remain rural, the Higashinohara area where the Hagiwaras live is filled with houses and growing.
With its broad, straight streets lined with palm trees, their neighborhood barely seems Japanese. City planning experts say that is part of its appeal.
""There are always people to talk to, and lots of kids,"" said Kanako Hagiwara, 36, who makes jewelry at home.
The area's biggest problem is crowded schools and a shortage of daycares. Two hundred children in Inzai are waiting for spots even as more centers are built.    
The Urban Renaissance Agency (UR), a quasi-governmental group responsible for large-scale development in Japan, provided 1,379 hectares (3,400 acres) of land for Inzai after the regional government bought it from private owners.
""Chiba Newtown aimed to provide residential land for families raising children,"" said Soichi Hirakawa of UR's sales and planning department. As a result, most residents are in their 30s, and some work at the companies attracted by Inzai's corporate tax rebates, which can be as high as $62 million stretched over several years.
The more established Sakura was never part of UR's development plans. 
       
DIFFERENT TIMES
Kodama was lured by the dream of buying a new home, unaffordable in Tokyo, in Sakura's Sunny Newtown development, carved out of mountains and rice fields.
Now many of the houses are dated or even falling down, the area dotted with vacant lots. Unlike Inzai, Sakura has failed to bring in large companies, and residents say the local government hasn't listened to what they need.
""When I walk around, there's a bunch of abandoned houses,"" said 77-year-old Kenzo Ito, who has lived in Sennari for 50 years. ""It'd be nice if somebody lived in them, or if young people built houses here.""
The school, now 43 years old, has lost 75 percent of students from its 1978 peak. New supermarkets in neighboring areas have driven many local shops out of business, and shoppers complain Sakura did nothing to provide alternatives or easy transport.
Taeko Suzuki, 81, a widow, shoulders a daypack to walk more than a kilometer for shopping.
""I've been to Inzai once; they have lots of stores and it's nice,"" she said. ""But saying I'm envious doesn't get me anywhere."" 
Although Sakura's older population requires more services, its taxes per person are about half those of Inzai. Sakura official Takanari Yajima acknowledged the city was struggling to provide for all.
""There are bedridden people who need nursing care, while others are still energetic,"" he said. ""There's just too many different things."" 
The city does offer financial support for people under 40 who want to live near elderly parents, or moving and housing aid of up to 300,000 yen ($2,662) for young couples with lower incomes. Success has been limited, officials say, partly because some of the programs are only a few years old.
Sakura officials point to the Yukarigaoka area as a bright spot, noting it has seen an influx of younger residents drawn by a new mixed-use development. In most of that area, less than 10 percent of the population is elderly. 
In Inzai, Kanako Hagiwara says she wants to stay for the long term. Her husband is more doubtful.

""I think it would be best if there is something of an exchange of generations,"" he said. ""If all the young people leave, this will just become a ghost town.""

3,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2018 07:45PM ET</span>",'We can't go anywhere': Myanmar closes Rohingya camps but 'entrenches segregation',"By Thu Thu Aung and Simon Lewis
YANGON (Reuters) - As the world was focused on abortive efforts to begin repatriating hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees from Bangladesh to Myanmar last month, hundreds of their fellow Muslims still in Myanmar were boarding boats seeking to escape the country.
Their attempted flight cast the spotlight back on 128,000 Rohingya and other displaced Muslims still living in crowded camps in Myanmar's western state of Rakhine, six years after Buddhist mobs razed most of their homes.
The government of Aung San Suu Kyi, under international pressure to address their plight, says it is now closing the camps on the grounds that doing so will help development and put the labor of camp residents to good use. 
But Reuters interviews with more than a dozen residents from five camps and internal United Nations documents show the move simply means building new, more permanent homes next to the camps - rather than allowing them to return to the areas from which they fled - leaving their situation little changed.
Those that have moved into the new accommodation remain under the same severe movement restrictions as before, residents and staff working in the camps say. A network of official checkpoints and threats of violence by local Buddhists prevent Muslims from moving freely in Rakhine. As a result, those sources say, they are cut off from sources of livelihoods and most services, and reliant on humanitarian handouts.
""Yes, we moved to new houses – it's correct to say (the camp is closed),"" said Kyaw Aye, a community leader from a camp called Nidin, in central Rakhine. ""But we'll never be able to stand on our own feet because we can't go anywhere."" 
Reuters spoke to displaced Muslims in Rakhine by phone as reporters are denied independent access to the camps.
Myanmar's Minister of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement Win Myat Aye said the government was working with the United Nations on a national strategy to close camps housing people forced out of their homes by violence in Rakhine and elsewhere, known as internally displaced persons or IDPs.
There were no legal restrictions on the movements of displaced people in Rakhine, as long as they accepted a so-called national verification card that also gives them equal access to healthcare and education, he said in a written response to Reuters' questions.
Aid workers and Muslim residents say severe restrictions persist even on those who have accepted the identity card, which most Rohingya reject because they say it treats them as foreigners who have to prove their nationality.
The U.N. chief in Myanmar, Knut Ostby, warned in a Sept. 24 private note that the government's plan for camp closures ""risks further entrenching segregation while denying IDPs many of their fundamental human rights"". 
Ostby's office declined to comment on the note, but in a written response to Reuters' questions said the U.N. had been invited to comment on the government's plans for closing camps and was preparing its response.
That response would include recommendations that all displaced people be granted freedom of movement, were involved in planning their resettlement and could return to their homes or another place of their choosing, Ostby said.
MARITIME ESCAPE
Rohingya community leaders say that improving conditions for those still living in Rakhine is one of the keys to persuading the hundreds of thousands sheltering in refugee camps in Bangladesh to return.
Some 730,000 fled a military crackdown after attacks by Rohingya militants in August 2017. U.N.-mandated investigators have said the Myanmar military unleashed a campaign of killings, rape and arson with ""genocidal intent"". Myanmar has denied almost all the accusations against its troops, who it says engaged in legitimate operations against terrorists.
Refugees baulked at a plan for repatriating them that was supposed to begin in mid-November, arguing that conditions were not right for return.
Meanwhile, at least three boats, each carrying scores of men, women and children, have departed from Rakhine for Malaysia since monsoon rains abated in October, following the hazardous maritime escape route used for years by Rohingya fleeing what they say is persecution in Myanmar.
""If they are making the choice to go by boat, it's clear proof of the conditions in the IDP camps,"" said Khin Maung, a Rohingya youth activist in Bangladesh. 
He is in touch with fellow Muslims who are ""living like prisoners"" in the camps in central Rakhine, Khin Maung said. ""If they are living like that how can we agree to go back?""
Win Myat Aye, the minister, said Myanmar was working to improve the lives of both the IDPs and potential returnees. 
""I assume that the displaced people are leaving with boats because they (have) not fully understood what we arranged for their accommodations, livelihoods and socio-economic development,"" he said.
""INVESTING IN SEGREGATION""
One camp, among the 18 remaining in Rakhine, lies outside a central Rakhine town of Myebon, which was torn by communal violence in 2012.
The 3,000-strong Muslim community was expelled and put in the camp, known as Taungpaw, on a narrow strip between the now Buddhist-only town and the Bay of Bengal, in what was supposed to be a temporary arrangement.
This year authorities built 200 new houses on rice paddies next to the camp, despite concerns that the area was prone to flooding. They were inundated in early June. In September, the government also built two new buildings set to become Muslim-only schoolhouses.
""This is a sign the Rakhine state government is investing in permanent segregation rather than promoting integration,"" said a previously unpublished memo dated Sept. 30 and circulated by U.N. officials setting out the concerns of aid workers operating in the camps. The U.N. said it did not comment on leaked documents. 
Some Muslims in Myebon have Myanmar citizenship and others have accepted national verification cards. They say they still cannot visit the town, where communal tensions have stayed high since the 2012 violence. Rakhine Buddhists have at times blocked aid deliveries to the camp.
""Although they gave people new homes, if there's still no freedom to move, there's still no opportunity to do business,"" said camp resident Cho Cho, 49.
Aung Thar Kyaw, a leader among the Rakhine Buddhist community in Myebon, said the two communities were too different to live together, labeling Muslims ""so aggressive"".
""The government already built them new homes so they don't need to enter town,"" he said.
Lei Lei Aye, an official in the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement, referred questions about the specific concerns in Taungpaw to Rakhine state government officials, who could not be reached for comment.
""POLICY OF APARTHEID""
Despite the humanitarian community's efforts to convince Myanmar to change course, including by giving technical advice on camp closures, ""the only scenario that is unfolding before our eyes is the implementation of a policy of apartheid with the permanent segregation of all Muslims, the vast majority of whom are stateless Rohingya, in central Rakhine,"" said an internal ""discussion note"" prepared by the U.N.'s refugee agency in late September, first reported by Frontier Myanmar magazine and reviewed by Reuters. 
Win Myat Aye said he was ""not concerned"" about such warnings because the government was progressing with its camp closure strategy in consultation with U.N. agencies, non-governmental groups and foreign diplomats.
The U.N. estimates humanitarian assistance in Rakhine will cost about $145 million next year.
Former residents of Nidin, about 100 km (62 miles) north of Taungpaw, told Reuters their situation had barely improved since state media declared the camp closed in August.
They are unable to return to Kyauktaw, the town where many lived and worked before the 2012 violence. 
Tun Wai, a Rakhine Buddhist doctor in Kyauktaw, said Muslims could ""go freely outside the town"". But if they try to return, he said, ""they will be killed"". 
Soe Lwin, deputy chief of the Kyauktaw police station, said Muslims ""can't enter the town"", but denied they would meet with violence. ""We have the rule of law,"" he said. 
The Muslims now live marooned among rice paddies that do not belong to them. Rohingya fishermen say what they catch barely covers their rental costs as they do not own their equipment.
And with no clean water supply, children have contracted skin rashes from washing in agricultural run-off.

""We can't even support our children because we don't have income,"" said former camp resident Khin Hla, 43. ""Without aid, we would starve.""

4,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2018 04:14PM ET</span>","Mexico suggests work visas for Central Americans, wants U.S. to do same","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador proposed on Wednesday offering more work visas for Central Americans and said the United States should do the same, part of a negotiation aimed at stemming the northward flow of migrants.
Lopez Obrador, who took office on Saturday, said he would discuss immigration with U.S. President Donald Trump in coming days, including increasing investment in southern Mexico and Central America. 
""We are proposing investment in productive projects and in job creation, and not only that, also work visas for Mexico and for the United States,"" he told a news conference, saying he would give more details ""soon.""
Mexico and the United States have been in talks about how to manage the large groups moving through Mexico in caravans, with Lopez Obrador pushing for investment to address the poverty and crime that drive thousands of people every year from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.
Lopez Obrador, soon after being elected in July, sent a letter to Trump suggesting they work together to address the root causes of immigration. 
""It is very important to us that we reach an investment agreement between companies and governments, to create jobs in Central America and our country,"" he said.
Lopez Obrador plans major infrastructure projects in the impoverished south of Mexico including his home state of Tabasco. He says those plans, including a refinery and two railways will provide jobs to Mexicans and Central Americans. 
He did not reply when asked if his government was considering a U.S. proposal to return Central American asylum seekers to Mexican territory while U.S. courts processed their cases, saying only that their rights would be respected.
The arrival of several thousand Central Americans in Mexico's border city of Tijuana about a month ago prompted Trump to mobilize the U.S. Army to beef up border security, while restricting the number of asylum applications accepted per day. 
While overall illegal immigration across the U.S.-Mexico border is much lower than it was 20 years ago, there are more Central Americans, families and asylum seekers than in the past.

Some migrants clambered over a tall fence to cross into the United States from Tijuana on Tuesday, hoping to speed their asylum applications by turning themselves over to U.S. Border Patrol officials.

Prosecutors said he played an active role in the protests and provoked public unrest through social media. They also said he supported members of a terrorist organization against the police, the news agency said.
It is not clear how the warrant can be served because Dundar has left the country.
Dundar, a former editor of opposition newspaper Cumhuriyet, was sentenced in 2016 to five years for publishing a video purporting to show Turkey's intelligence agency trucking weapons into Syria. He was released pending appeal and went abroad.
Hundreds of thousands of people marched in 2013 to protest a plan to build a replica of an Ottoman barracks on Gezi park in the center of the city. The protests turned into a direct challenge to Erdogan's government.
""#HepmizGezideydik We feel proud,"" Dundar wrote on his Twitter on Wednesday, sharing Anadolu's story about his arrest warrant. The hashtag translates to: ""We were all at Gezi"".
Two weeks ago 13 people were arrested as part of the Gezi investigation.
Erdogan says the protests were organized and financed by Osman Kavala, a businessman and rights activists. Kavala was detained more than a year ago in connection with the investigation. He has not been charged over the protests and denies the claim against him.
The prosecutor also said Dundar was in contact with Kavala during the protests in a written arrest request to the court, Anadolu reported.
Aside from the investigation into the Gezi Park protests, authorities have detained tens of thousands of people they suspect in the wake of a coup attempt in 2016 of opposing Erdogan's government.
Turkey's western allies have voiced concern over the crackdown on journalists, academics, rights activists and criticized Erdogan for using it to muzzle dissent and increase his own power.

6,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2018 03:48PM ET</span>",PM suggests Serbia could intervene if Kosovo sets up full army,"By Aleksandar Vasovic
BELGRADE (Reuters) - Serbia's prime minister suggested on Wednesday that any creation of a standing army in Kosovo could provoke a military intervention by Belgrade, two decades after Kosovo Albanians' uprising against Serbian rule.
The predominantly ethnic Albanian Kosovo parliament is set to vote on Dec 14 on whether to transform its 4,000-strong, but lightly armed, defense force into a regular army. 
Though that process could take years, Serbian politicians maintain that a Kosovo army could be used to expel remaining minority Serbs from Kosovo, an accusation denied by Kosovar leaders who rely on European Union and U.S. support in reforms and development of the impoverished, small Balkan state.
""I am hoping we would never have to use it (the army), but this is currently one of the options on the table as we do not want to watch this ... ethnic cleansing,"" Prime Minister Ana Brnabic told reporters in Belgrade.
Balkans analysts said that any action by Serbia's 28,000-strong army against Kosovo is highly unlikely given Belgrade's aspirations to join the EU and that Brnabic's remarks appeared to be a sop to Serbian nationalists.
""Brnabic's claims...are in conflict with a recent statement of President Aleksandar Vucic who said that sending the (Serbian) army to Kosovo would lead to direct conflict with NATO,"" said Milan Karagaca, a former military diplomat and a member of Belgrade's Center for Foreign Policy think-tank.
Fraught relations between Serbia and Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008, soured further when Pristina slapped 100 percent tariffs on imports from Serbia and Bosnia on Nov 21 in retaliation for Belgrade's lobbying against Kosovo's admission to Interpol, the international police group.
NATO's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg described the idea of creating a Kosovo army as ill-timed. 
""Such a move ... goes against the advice of many NATO allies and may have serious repercussions for Kosovo's future Euro-Atlantic integration,"" Stoltenberg said in Brussels.
He also described the tariffs introduced by Pristina as divisive, adding that such steps are making EU-mediated dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo ""even more difficult."" 
He urged both sides to refrain from provocative steps and statements and to seek compromises if they want to move ""toward a better future.""
Brnabic said the tariff hike would bring trade with Kosovo to a halt, costing Serbia 42 million euros a month. But Vucic said on Tuesday there would be no counter-measures.
The EU has said Belgrade and Pristina must normalize relations and resolve territorial and other outstanding disputes as a condition for progress toward EU membership both seek. 
Kosovo's independence came almost a decade after a NATO air war halted a two-year crackdown by Serbian security forces against Kosovo Albanians including arrests, killings and expulsions of ethnic Albanian civilians. 
Kosovo has since been recognized by more than 110 countries. A group of nations including Serbia, China, five EU members and Russia have refused to recognize it. 

Although Serbia maintains military neutrality, it belongs to NATO's Partnership for Peace Program, while retaining its longstanding political and security ties with Russia.

(Reuters) - A former Hong Kong government official was found guilty on Wednesday of U.S. charges that he took part in a scheme to bribe officials in Chad and Uganda in exchange for contracts for a Chinese energy company, according to a spokesman for federal prosecutors.
Chi Ping Patrick Ho, 69, was convicted of seven of the eight counts against by a jury in federal court in Manhattan after a trial lasting just over a week.
Edward Kim, a lawyer for Ho, declined to comment.
Ho, a former Hong Kong home affairs secretary, was arrested in November 2017 on charges of violating U.S. foreign corruption law, money laundering and conspiracy. Federal prosecutors said he arranged bribes on behalf of a Chinese energy company that funds an organization he leads.
At the time of his arrest, Ho was secretary-general of the Hong Kong-based China Energy Fund Committee, an organization funded by the Shanghai-based energy conglomerate CEFC China Energy.
Prosecutors said Ho caused the energy company to offer a $2 million bribe to the president of Chad, Idriss Deby, in 2015 in exchange for exclusive oil rights in that country.
The government of Chad has denied the U.S. charges.
Prosecutors also said that Ho caused $500,000 to be wired to Uganda’s foreign minister in 2016, with the promise of further payments in the future, to secure favors for the Chinese company, including the potential acquisition of a Ugandan bank.
Sam Kutesa, who previously served as president of the U.N. General Assembly, has been Uganda’s foreign minister since 2015. Uganda has denied the allegations.

Ednan Tofik ogly Agaev, a former Russian ambassador in Colombia, is charged with international corruption in a case revolving around the 2011 purchase by oil majors Eni and Shell (LON:RDSa) of Nigeria’s OPL 245 oilfield.
Milan prosecutors allege bribes totaling around $1.1 billion were paid to win the license to explore the field.
Agaev and all the parties involved in the case have denied any wrongdoing. 
In documents filed by prosecutors with the Milan court on Wednesday, it emerged that Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov handed over a letter to his Italian counterpart in Moscow at a meeting on Oct. 8, calling on Italian authorities to be ""reasonable"" in the case.
The letter said Russia was convinced Agaev had committed no wrongdoing.
""We hope the Italian authorities adopt a reasonable approach and after respective checks find a way to change the status of E.T. Agaev from accused to witness,"" the letter said.
The Italian and Russian foreign ministries did not respond to requests for comment.
During the hearing on Wednesday Italian prosecutor Sergio Spadaro described the request as ""at the very least surprising"".

The casualties, compared with 56 in 2017, were mostly in jungle and mountain areas previously controlled by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels, who demobilized last year under a peace deal with the government to end five decades of war.
As FARC members returned to civilian life, much of the drug trafficking and illegal mining territory they previously controlled has been occupied or fought over by criminal gangs, dissident rebels who did not lay down arms and the smaller rebel group the National Liberation Army (ELN).
""This year we have had an increase of more than 200 percent in people who have suffered accidents with mines, many with dramatic injuries,"" said Alvaro Jimenez, the director of the Colombian Campaign Against Landmines, which detailed the casualties in a report.
""We need to sound the alarm because we can't allow Colombia to return to being among the countries most affected"" by landmines, Jimenez said.
The majority of victims were civilians, the report said, a change from previous years when many were military personnel. 
The FARC traditionally warned civilian populations about mined areas, while current armed groups have largely not, the report said.
Colombia cleared 2 square kilometers (0.77 square miles) of landmines since the peace deal was signed in late 2016. 
Colombia, a signatory of the Ottawa Convention, which prohibits the production and use of landmines, has pledged to remove them by 2021. 
Given the current dynamic of the conflict, that target looks unlikely, the report said, and Colombia will likely have to set a new date or ask for a 10-year extension.

TBILISI (Reuters) - When the roof of a coal mine collapsed in the Georgian town of Tkibuli in July, killing four miners and injuring six, the small town was plunged into grief. Not for the first time.
In fact, just three months previously in April in an accident at the same pit, six miners were killed and three injured.
In all, 32 miners have died in accidents at the Mindeli mine in Tkibuli, 200 km (124 miles) west of the capital Tbilisi, over the past decade and most local men acknowledge that if they could find other work they would do.
The reality is there is no other alternative.
July's accident was caused by a build-up of pressure leading to an explosion.
After every serious accident, human rights activists and unions in Georgia renew their calls on authorities and private companies to improve security for miners.
After a protest in Tkibuli two years ago miners won some improvement in working conditions and a small pay rise.
But, in general, little changes, the protest mood fades and miners go back down the pit again.
(To see picture package, click on https://reut.rs/2FYaCO8 )
A few see it as an automatic continuation of a family tradition.
""I always wanted to work at the mine ... It's a difficult job, but it's interesting because I learn something new every day,"" said 20-year-old David Tsnobiladze, whose father and grandfather are also miners.
But he admits few of his young peers share his attitude.
""Many of them are unemployed, but still don't want to work at the mine because they're either afraid or lazy.""
Tkibuli is located in the lowlands of a scenic mountain gorge though the city itself is a typical Soviet-built industrial town with gray shabby houses and unsightly streets.
School children can head for the local stadium or pool after school is over or join in folk dancing classes. But for teenagers or those who are older, there is a sad dearth of night clubs or internet cafes.
Mining was developed in Tkibuli in the 19th century and the town became the center of Georgia's coal mining industry in Soviet times.
Miners were an elite class of worker at the time. They had good salaries and perks and Soviet dictator Josef Stalin even spared them the draft during the war.
An infrastructure grew up around the mines.
But all that changed with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Textile workshops, a lemonade-producing factory and other small businesses were closed, leaving the mine as almost the only job option for locals now living in an independent state.
""If there was a chance to find another job in this city, nobody would work at the mine,"" said 30-year-old Gocha Gabunia.
He was also slightly injured in one of the accidents, though he got back to work a few days after that.
Some think the deadly mine should be shut down.

""Agricultural farms should be built around the city. That would be an alternative to the mine,"" said 16-year-old Luka Bakradze.

The sentence is one among several trials and retrials against Badie, Shater and other leaders of the party that ruled Egypt before the military ousted Mursi following mass protests against his rule.
Badie and Shater were sentenced to life in 2015 over violence between Brotherhood supporters and opponents near the group's headquarters.
Four others were also handed life sentences on Wednesday. The court acquitted Saad al-Katatny, parliament speaker under Mursi, along with a former minister, two prominent Brotherhood figures and two others.
The defendants can appeal the ruling for the last time before the Court of Cassation, Egypt's highest civilian court. 
The public prosecution may also appeal the acquittals or the life sentences that two defendants received instead of death sentences.
The defendants faced charges of inciting violence against the demonstrators in front of the Brotherhood headquarters, aggravated battery and the possession of firearms.
Authorities had referred 18 defendants to trial in the case. Five remain at large and one died before receiving a sentence.
The latest retrial began when the Court of Cassation accepted 13 defendants' appeals in January 2016.
Separately on Wednesday, two security sources and a judicial source said authorities arrested a justice minister under Mursi and are investigating him for belonging to an illegal group.
The security sources said National Security Agency officers arrested Ahmed Suleiman at his home in Minya governorate on Tuesday and later transferred him to Cairo.
Suleiman had criticized the arrest and trial of Brotherhood leaders after Mursi was ousted.
After Mursi's ouster, Egypt cracked down on its oldest and most organized Islamist movement, killing hundreds of its supporters during the violent dispersal of a sit-in, throwing thousands of its supporters in jail and labeling the group a terrorist organization.
The Brotherhood says it is a peaceful movement and denies links to attacks by Islamist militants.

CARACAS/MARACAIBO, Venezuela (Reuters) - Angelica Vera of Venezuela's western state of Zulia planned to cremate her father's remains after he died of cancer in November because hyperinflation has pushed the cost of funeral services beyond her financial reach.
But the cemetery could not offer a cremation because it had no natural gas, which is in ever shorter supply even though the OPEC nation holds some of the world's largest energy reserves. 
Nor could she afford to leave her father's remains in the morgue while waiting for gas supplies. Each extra day costs more than a month of minimum wage. 
She resorted to the only available option: leaving her father's body in an unmarked common grave at the edge of the cemetery, an area traditionally reserved for unclaimed bodies.
""My father died and I could not even hold a wake because I had no way of getting the money,"" said Vera, 27, a cashier. ""What us Venezuelans are living through is denigrating.""
The decay of Venezuela's oil industry burdened citizens for months with long gasoline queues and shortages of cooking gas, and has now hit families bidding farewell to loved ones.
Venezuelans have shifted toward cremations, which cost about a third of burials, but growing demand has crematories struggling to obtain natural gas. 
Members of a dozen families said in interviews they now wait as long as 10 days.
So far, common graves have been used primarily in Zulia, where blackouts and gas shortages tend to be most extreme. But decaying services in other states could spread the practice.
PRICES JUMP 
Shortages of wood and metal for coffins and cement for graves have complicated traditional burials. Some families wait for crematories to obtain propane gas. But the wait also boosts costs, with annual inflation nearing 1 million percent.
""The cost of cremation increased by 108 percent in just one week,"" said Ana Hernandez, 36, who is making arrangements to cremate her sister in a cemetery in the western city of Barquisimeto.
Shortages of medicine, food and basic goods have been constant since the 2014 collapse of oil prices battered Venezuela's socialist economy. Around 3 million people have emigrated since 2015, according to the United Nations. 
President Nicolas Maduro blames an ""economic war"" led by political adversaries with Washington's help. The Information Ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment on cremations.
Gladys Gonzalez, 52, an attorney from the second city of Maracaibo, spent four days waiting to cremate her mother who died at 72 of a stomach infection after struggling to find antibiotics.

""No one deserves this much suffering,"" she said at the Maracaibo cemetery.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia on Wednesday warned authorities in Cyprus not to allow the U.S. military to deploy on their territory, saying such a move would draw a Russian reaction and result in ""dangerous and destabilizing consequences"" for the Mediterranean island.
Maria Zakharova, a spokesman for Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said Moscow had become aware of what she called ""anti-Russian plans"" involving Cyprus and the U.S. military which she said was eyeing setting up forward operating bases for its troops there.
""We're getting information from various sources that the United States is actively studying options to build up its military presence on Cyprus,"" Zakharova told a news briefing in Moscow.
""The aim is not being hidden - to counter growing Russian influence in the region in the light of the successful operation by the Russian military in Syria.""
There was no immediate U.S. response to her comments.
Zakharova said a U.S. delegation had inspected potential sites for the bases and that Washington was engaged in intensive talks with Nicosia on expanding military cooperation. 
Cyprus is a popular destination for Russian tourists and capital and many wealthy Russian business people bank or own property there. The island, a former British colony, hosts two British military bases. The United States is not known to have any bases there but does have an embassy in Nicosia. 
Cypriot media said the island had recently appointed a military attache to Washington. 
Zakharova said Russia had repeatedly warned Cypriot authorities against allowing the island to be further militarized.
""It being drawn into U.S. and NATO plans in the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East will inevitably lead to dangerous and destabilizing consequences for Cyprus itself,"" she said. 
""In Moscow we can't ignore the anti-Russian element in these (U.S.) plans and in the event that they are implemented we will be forced to take counter measures.""

Police detained Francois Compaore at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris in October 2017 on an international arrest warrant related to the 1998 murder of Norbert Zongo, who published Burkina Faso's Independent newspaper.
The killing of Zongo, who had been investigating the murder of a driver who worked for Francois Compaore, became a symbol of repression during Blaise Compaore's 27-year rule, which ended in 2014 at the hands of a popular uprising.
Compaore's lawyer Pierre-Olivier Sur has said the charges against his client are politically motivated by a Burkinabe government unable to try Blaise Compaore, whom the government of neighboring Ivory Coast refuses to extradite.
Sur and a second lawyer for Compaore said in a statement that they had immediately appealed the decision to the Court of Cassation, which suspends the appeal court's decision. 
Blaise Compaore fled to Ivory Coast during the uprising. He faces an international arrest warrant in connection with the 1987 murder of former president Thomas Sankara.
Activists are pushing President Roch Marc Christian Kabore to aggressively pursue cases of past human rights abuses. Critics say his government has been too slow to move against former government members, some of whom serve in the current administration.

The government on Friday proposed using Lindholm island for up to 100 criminals whose sentence of deportation cannot be carried out because they risk torture or execution in their home country.
The plan is the government's latest bid to curb immigration.
The immigration ministry even has a tracker counting the tightening of immigration legislation on its website.
Critics say the plan is draconian but it is supported by the government's anti-immigrant ally, the Danish People's Party.
""I have serious concerns with this plan and we will monitor it and discuss it ... with the government,"" Bachelet told journalists in Geneva. 
""We've seen the negative impact of such policies of isolation, and (they) should not replicate these policies. Because depriving them of their liberty, isolating them, and stigmatising them will only increase their vulnerability,"" she added.
Under the plan, the criminals could leave the island during the day but would have to report their whereabouts to authorities and return at night.
""They are unwanted in Denmark and they must feel that,"" said Integration Minister Inger Stojberg in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post after the proposal was announced.
Lindholm is 7 acres square and is currently used by scientists from the Technical University of Denmark researching swine flu and rabies among other things. 
One ferry traveling to the island is named ""Virus"". 
The center, which will be able to hold up to 100 persons, is set to be established in 2021 and will cost 759 million Danish crowns ($115.48 million). 
Parliament will vote on the proposal this month. Denmark is set to hold an election no later than June 17th next year.

Patrick, 62, has told close allies, staff and advisers of his decision, Politico reported, citing sources close to the governor. An official announcement was expected to come this week.
The reason behind his move was not immediately known. 
Fresh off the November elections in which Democrats gained close to 40 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, members of the party are in the early stages of planning a 2020 challenge to Republican President Donald Trump.
More than two dozen potential contenders, ranging from former Vice President Joe Biden to U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren to billionaire former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, have been mentioned in various news reports.
A representative of Bain Capital, a private investment firm where Patrick is a managing director, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He joined Bain in 2015.
Patrick, who served as governor from 2007 to 2015, was encouraged by close advisers and members of Obama's inner circle to run in 2020, according to reports. 
In 2014, Obama told a Boston television station that Patrick would make ""a great president or vice president.""

Patrick graduated from Harvard College and Harvard Law School. He was appointed by former President Bill Clinton in 1994 as assistant attorney general over the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.

21,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2018 10:15AM ET</span>",Imprisoned Serb ex-commander indicted by Bosnia over wartime killings,"SARAJEVO (Reuters) - A Bosnian Serb ex-commander, who was jailed for 28 years by the U.N. war crimes tribunal for rape and enslavement in Bosnia's war of the 1990s, has now been indicted over the killing of Muslim civilians, Bosnia's prosecutors office said on Wednesday.
Dragoljub Kunarac, 58, who was the commander of a special unit of the Bosnian Serb army, is accused of taking part in killing of at least six people and torture and persecution of Muslim civilians from villages around the eastern Bosnian town of Foca in July 1992, the prosecutor said in a statement.
He is also accused of taking part in looting and burning down Muslim homes, the statement said.
Foca was notorious for the mass persecution and killings of Muslims by the Bosnian Serb forces as part of a campaign to form an exclusively Serb region, and for detention camps in which women and young girls were raped and enslaved.
The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) jailed Kunarac in 2001 for 28 years over torture, rape and enslavement in the first case in which the tribunal pronounced rape and enslavement to be crimes against humanity. He is serving his prison term in Germany. 
The ICTY President Theodor Meron in 2016 denied his request to be released after serving two-thirds of the term. Kunarac is expected to appeal again, after Meron leaves his job in January 2019.
Bosnia's state court needs to confirm the indictment against him. It is not clear whether any sentence he may receive if convicted in Bosnia would run alongside the ICTY sentence or be in addition to it. 
Around 100,000 people were killed and 2 million moved from their homes during Bosnia's 1992-95 war.

ADEN/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - A team from Yemen's Saudi-backed government left for Sweden on Wednesday to attend peace talks with members of the Iran-aligned Houthi group, in a renewed U.N. push to end a war that has pushed the country to the brink of starvation.
One representative of the internationally-recognized government, Abdullah al-Alimi, tweeted that the talks were ""a true opportunity for peace,"" before the delegation flew out of the Saudi capital Riyadh.
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates - leaders of a Western-backed coalition battling the Houthis to restore President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi's government - want to exit a war that has dragged on for nearly four years.
Western allies, which provide arms and intelligence to the coalition, have ramped up pressure on them to find a way to end a conflict that killed tens of thousands of people and left more than 8 million facing famine.
The Saudi-led alliance intervened in the civil war in 2015 after the Houthi movement ousted Hadi's government from the Yemeni capital Sanaa in 2014. But the conflict has seen military stalemate since the alliance seized the southern port of Aden.
The conflict is seen across the region as a proxy war between Sunni Muslim power Riyadh and Shi'ite Tehran.
Seeking to reinvigorate peace efforts, U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths secured some confidence-building measures, including the evacuation of Houthi wounded, to help persuade the movement to attend the talks in Sweden.
The Houthi delegation arrived there on Tuesday, having failed to turn up for previous talks in Geneva in September.
TRUCE, PRISONER SWAP
The latest round, to be held in a renovated castle outside Stockholm, will focus on agreeing other confidence-building steps and the formation of a transitional governing body.
It was not clear if the warring parties would hold direct talks or if Griffiths would shuttle between the two sides.
""If the consultations proceed positively, we will see an immediate change for people in Yemen. We will see fewer people hit by and fleeing violence, fewer people pushed to the most desperate means of staying alive,"" said Mohamed Abdi, Yemen country director for the Norwegian Refugee Council.
""Equally, if the consultations fail, or stall, so too will hopes of halting Yemen’s steady descent into hell,"" he said in a statement.
The U.N. envoy is seeking agreement on reopening Sanaa airport, swapping prisoners and securing a truce in the Houthi-held port of Hodeidah, now a focus of the war. This could lead to a wider ceasefire that would halt coalition air strikes and Houthi missile attacks on Saudi cities.
The United Nations is trying to avert a full-scale assault on Hodeidah, the entry point for most of Yemen's commercial goods and aid. Both sides have reinforced positions in the Red Sea city in sporadic battles after a de-escalation last month.
International outrage over the Oct. 2 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom's Istanbul consulate has refocused attention on the Yemen war and scrutiny over Saudi Arabia's activities in the region. The U.S. Senate is set to consider a resolution to end support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen.

The United States last month halted refueling support for coalition warplanes, whose air strikes have been blamed for the deaths of thousands of civilians.

ZAGREB (Reuters) - Croatia is suffering a severe labor shortage, most glaringly in its booming seaside tourist resorts, that is compounding obstacles to economic growth and dimming hopes of catching up to more developed European Union peers.
The problem reflects poor levels of pay, education and skills-training in a still mainly state-dominated economy that has driven many young Croats to find more lucrative, fulfilling work in affluent western EU countries, analysts say.
""The mismatch between education and the needs of the economy, a low readiness for mobility within Croatia and a high number of people leaving to work in other EU states negatively affect Croatia's labor market,"" Iva Tomic at the Zagreb Economic Institute think-tank told Reuters.
According to the national employers' association HUP, Croatian firms cannot fill at least 30,000 jobs, largely in tourism, which accounts for almost 20 percent of gross domestic product, and in construction, retail and manufacturing.
This at a time when Croatia and other European Mediterranean tourist hotspots are struggling to cope with huge crowds arriving on cheap flights and cruise ships in the summer high season.
Tourism in Croatia, with its spectacular, rugged Dalmatian seacoast and offshore islands, regularly offsets the country's considerable trade deficit, so it is crucial for the service sector underpinning it to be able to fill job openings.
But many other businesses, Croatian- or foreign-owned, also have many job opportunities going begging, compounding the drag on growth and helping keep the unemployment rate unacceptably high - currently at 9.1 percent, analysts say.
That is down from 11.6 percent a year, but only because of the brain drain of young Croats. 
""In (the town of) Sisak there is a visible lack of adequate workers. In the past financial year, when we hired 71 workers, 40 percent of those interviewed did not meet the conditions and 43 percent of our 90 employees had to be trained internally,"" said Ivana Rumac at Italian-owned steelmaker ABS.
""The (Croatian) education system does not offer programs which provide skills we need,"" a company statement said.
ABS, in Sisak 50 km (30 miles) southeast of the capital Zagreb, has now built its workforce up to 116 with a target of 150 by the end of the current fiscal year next June.
Franz Letica, head of Zagreb's restaurant and bar owners association, said that in the first nine months of 2018 there were 782 unfilled openings for cooks and 1,493 for waiters, with only 272 cooks and 796 waiters employed in a city of 800,000.
The newest EU member country's public sector is also affected. Ankica Prasnjak at the nurses union said Zagreb University Hospital was short of some 300 nurses as many had gone to higher-paying jobs elsewhere in the EU.
Potential investors face similar difficulties.
""A bigger Austrian company wanted to expand business in Croatia but, because of a shortage of adequately skilled workforce, eventually opted for South America where it also runs businesses,"" said Sonja Holocher-Ertl, director of the Austrian Chamber of Commerce's office in Croatia.
NO SOLUTION ON HORIZON
Labor shortages are not unique to Croatia - other emerging economies in Europe's ex-communist east and southeast have also
experienced a drain of young talent to the richer west of the EU, exploiting the right of free movement within the bloc.
But it explains analysts' doubt that Croatia's longer-term growth will surpass a modest 1-2 percent needed to rise to western levels of prosperity.
At the moment the former Yugoslav republic's economy is expanding just below three percent annually, but even that is below peers in eastern and southeastern Europe.
Labor-starved businesses are lobbying the Zagreb government to raise the annual quota for foreign workers, which this year amounted to 38,769 licenses.
But skilled workers from less developed European economies are difficult to lure as they can find better paid jobs further west, for instance in wealthy Austria or Germany.
The average salary in Croatia in September was 6,195 kuna ($950.21), far below western European levels. Croatian media report anecdotally that Croats working in hotels in Austria earn at least double what they could at home. 
""Businesses here cannot raise salaries much and thus become more competitive because they would jeopardize their profitability,"" Tomic said.
Critics say that excessive red tape and high tax rates lingering from Croatia's communist past within Yugoslavia, lumbering judicial procedures and frequently changing, opaque regulations add to barriers to growth and investment.
While a clear solution for Croatia's growth problems is not in sight, senior Labour Ministry official Marija Knezevic Kajari said the domestic workforce pool was far from exhausted.
Only about 60 percent of Croatians between 15 and 64 years of age are employed - among the lowest rates in the EU.
""Importing workers is partly a solution but we believe there is space for retraining local people, for which we offer financial support to businesses and for people who have a business idea and want to be self-employed,"" Knezevic Kajari said.
In the meantime local businesses fear missing out on new contracts. ""With the shortage of skilled workers some employers are already having to cancel some business deals for next year. It has become a very serious problem,"" the HUP statement said.

Sierra Leone is one of Africa's poorest countries and its public hospitals lack equipment. The 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic killed nearly 4000 people, including more than 250 medical staff.

The visit to Islamabad by Zalmay Khalilzad, U.S. special representative to Afghanistan, followed President Donald Trump's request for Pakistan's help in finding an end to the 17-year-old war between Taliban insurgents and the western-backed Afghan government.
Khalilzad, an Afghan-born U.S. diplomat who served as George W. Bush's ambassador to Afghanistan, Iraq and the United Nations, was named by Trump three months ago as a special envoy to negotiate peace in Afghanistan.
""The prime minister reiterated Pakistan's abiding interest in achieving peace and reconciliation in Afghanistan through political settlement,"" Khan's office said in a statement. 
Trump's overture to Khan followed an exchange of barbed tweets between the leaders last month.
Officially allies in fighting terrorism, Pakistan and the United States have a complicated relationship, bound by Washington's dependence on Pakistan to supply its troops in Afghanistan, where the United States still has 14,000 troops, but plagued by accusations Islamabad is playing a double game.
U.S. officials have for years been pushing Pakistan to lean on Taliban leaders, who Washington says are based inside Pakistan, to bring them to the negotiating table. 
The U.S. and Afghanistan have long accused Pakistan of covertly sheltering Taliban, which Islamabad denies.
Islamabad has promised in the past to work to help bring the Afghan Taliban to the negotiation table, but this will be the first attempt for Khan's new government, in power since August.

The Pakistani statement quoted Khalilzad as saying that the U.S. leadership looked forward to working with Pakistan in furthering the shared goal of peace.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland's parliament elected to the cabinet on Wednesday two members whose apparent position on a draft pact with the European Union could complicate stalled talks with the bloc.
Karin Keller-Sutter, from the pro-business Liberals (FDP), and Viola Amherd, from the centre-right Christian People's Party (CVP), take office in January, giving the cabinet three women and four men.
The women are yet to announce their positions on the draft treaty but a source said that this month they separately told Swiss parties at closed-door talks they could not support it at the moment, given misgivings about it across the country's political spectrum.
The source said the current cabinet is itself split on the issue and lacks a majority on the pact, a situation unlikely to change if the debate stretches into next year.
The government is due to decide on Friday whether to support the draft that streamlines ties with the EU, Switzerland's top trading partner.
The anti-immigration Swiss People's Party (SVP) is pushing to cancel freedom of movement for European workers.
The stalemate over the deal has escalated as the EU says it could deny recognition of Swiss stock market rules to gain leverage, prompting the Swiss to threaten retaliatory measures that could affect trading on Europe's fourth-largest bourse.
Keller-Sutter, who replaces pro-Europe party colleague Johann Schneider-Ammann, has said any pact must have broad domestic political support, including from labor, which opposes a deal for fear it could dilute wage protections.
""I can't rule out that if there's no agreement, we may have to pay the price with certain harassment"" from the EU, Keller-Sutter told the newspaper Neue Zuercher Zeitung. ""We might just have to take it.""
Amherd replaces Doris Leuthard, a pro-Europe CVP member who on Wednesday warned that Switzerland delays a deal at its own peril. 
""The longer we don't find an agreement with the EU, the higher the price will be,"" Leuthard told parliament. 
Amherd has said a deal with Europe should not come at the expense of wage protections but saw room for compromise.
At a post-election press conference, she declined to give her position, saying she would leave Friday's treaty decision to the current cabinet.

""I don't have any wishes for what they'll do,"" Amherd said. ""They'll make their decision based on documents that I haven't seen yet. I'll respect their decision, and I'll use that to make my own decisions when it's necessary.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's executive proposed on Wednesday spending more money to counter fake news on the Internet, establishing an early warning system to alert governments and pushing tech companies do more to stop disinformation before next year's EU elections.
The European Commission's plan, which must be agreed by EU leaders, is part of an attempt to stop what the United States, NATO and the EU say are Russian attempts to undermine Western democracies with disinformation campaigns that sow division. Russia has repeatedly denied any such actions.
""There is strong evidence pointing to Russia as a primary source of disinformation in Europe. Disinformation is part of Russia's military doctrine and part of a strategy to divide and weaken the West,"" said Commission Vice President Andrus Ansip.
Before elections to the European Parliament in May 2019, the Commission wants to see tech giants such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) agree to step up efforts to remove misleading or illegal content. That would include incitement to hatred, extremism and the online sale of counterfeit products.
With a code of practice that commits online platforms and advertisers to take steps to keep fake news from being both uploaded and disseminated, the Commission wants messages automatically spread by machines, or bots, labeled as such.
The proposal will also seek to develop a more powerful section to monitor and flag Russian misinformation, raising the budget of the EU's foreign service EEAS for this to 5 million euros ($5.7 million) from 1.9 million in 2018.
That is far less than the billions of dollars that NATO and the EU say Russia spends on disinformation, but Western governments are wary of any strategy that could be construed as indoctrination.
Russia has invested in a state-of-the-art media organization with hundreds of journalists abroad intended to wean the world off what it calls aggressive Western propaganda - dubbing it, with echoes of the Cold War, Sputnik.
It is also now very active on the internet, in social media such as Twitter.
A third step for the EU would be to create a ""rapid alert"" mechanism to warn governments, so they can fend off developing disinformation campaigns.
Facebook has stepped up fact-checking to counter fake news and is working on lowering the ranking of such disinformation to making it less visible. It still faces criticism that it is too slow to close rogue accounts.
Facebook disclosed last year that Russians with fake names used the social network to try to influence U.S. voters in the months before and after the 2016 election, writing about inflammatory subjects, setting up events and buying ads.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An Indian court on Wednesday remanded to custody a British businessman accused of paying bribes to Indian officials to win a helicopter deal for Anglo-Italian firm AgustaWestland, following a rare extradition.
The case threatens strong repercussions for India's opposition Congress party, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party called the extradition of Christian Michel a victory in its fight against graft.
""Who knows what secrets will tumble out once he starts talking?"" Modi said at a rally in western Rajasthan which is electing a new state assembly. 
Modi is seeking to embarrass Congress because the 2010 deal to buy 12 helicopters for about 36 billion rupees ($511 million) was struck during its tenure although its government canceled the deal in 2014 and ordered a police inquiry into the bribery accusations.
Michel, 54, acted as a middleman to swing the deal for AgustaWestland, now a unit of the Italian defense group Leonardo, India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said in a news release on Tuesday. 
It said two firms he floated entered into as many as 12 contracts with Finmeccanica, which changed its name to Leonardo last year, through which 42 million euros ($48 million) was paid, but with no receipts or details of services he offered. 
The CBI alleged these were kickbacks to Indian authorities.
Michel, who has denied any wrongdoing, was remanded to custody until his next hearing on Dec. 10.
On Wednesday, his lawyer, Rosemary Patrizi, told the Times Now news channel his extradition was politically motivated and would be challenged in the Indian courts. 
On the campaign trail, Modi said his government was committed to pursuing the helicopter case to the end.
""We investigated the scam after coming to power and caught one of the accused,"" he added. ""You must have read in the papers that the government has got him extradited from Dubai."" 
India is one of the world's biggest armed importers but has long faced criticism for an opaque defense procurement process and many deals have ended up being investigated for wrongdoing.

KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - The Polish official leading U.N. talks to revive the Paris climate deal said his country is committed to greener fuel even though his president has vowed not to let anyone ""murder coal mining"".
On Tuesday, the first full day of negotiations in Katowice, capital of mining region Silesia, President Andrzej Duda told workers celebrating the feast of their patron Saint Barbara that the industry had a long future.
The comments sent shock-waves through two-week U.N. talks Poland is hosting to agree rules for implementing the 2015 Paris accord to phase out fossil fuel.
Poland's Deputy Environment Minister Michal Kurtyka told Reuters he is working toward an ambitious deal that respects ""the letter and the spirit"" of Paris and said it was the energy ministry, not the president, who set policy.
""Poland is not building any more new coal structures. It's a very powerful engagement,"" he said in the interview. ""New additional capacities are being built in the renewables sector.""
Poland, which relies on coal for around 80 percent of its power and more than 82,000 mining jobs, is an unlikely host for U.N. climate talks, but Kurtyka said the country was eager to share with the rest of the world its capacity for transition.
Over the last 30 years, the former communist-run nation has shifted from a centrally-controlled economy, which the official said was not a good system for humans or the environment.
Now, as the presidency of climate talks, he said Poland was seeking ""a just transition"" to a greener world.
Those comments may allay concern over Duda's speech on Tuesday where he declared to miners: ""Please don't be worried. As long as I'm president of Poland, I won't let anyone murder coal-mining."" 
""UNIQUE ACHIEVEMENT OF HUMANITY""
Together with Britain, Poland on Tuesday launched an initiative to promote electric vehicles, which Kurtyka said would be less polluting than conventional engines even if they were powered by coal-fired electricity.
Trained as an engineer, Kurtyka said electric vehicles were more efficient than internal combustion engines, which generate waste heat and pollution.
Nearly 40 countries had signed up to the initiative on knowledge sharing, he said, and for Poland electric mobility could help the country generate jobs to replace mining.
Campaigners are highly critical of the pace of change as evidence mounts of the growing gap between the need to cut emissions and the work done so far.
This week's U.N. talks are technical negotiations ahead of ministerial debate next week.
Kurtyka said challenges included sharing the burden between developed and developing nations of the cost of moving to a low-carbon world. But political will was strong to deliver on the 2015 Paris agreement and climate concern could override national agendas, even in politically divided times, he added.
""I think it is considered very much as a unique achievement of humanity,"" he said of the Paris agreement.

""It is in their hands. It is in the parties' hands to reach a consensus,"" he said, referring to the nearly 200 nations involved, adding: ""I am very reassured. Everybody's willing to progress.""

36,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2018 06:26AM ET</span>",Germany's Schaeuble gives valuable backing to old Merkel rival to head party,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Veteran German conservative Wolfgang Schaeuble, a highly-respected figure in his party, has publicly backed Friedrich Merz, a former rival of Angela Merkel, to succeed her as head of the Christian Democrats (CDU) in a vote set for Friday.
The winner will be in pole position to be the CDU's candidate for chancellor of Europe's biggest economy in a 2021 election and the outcome could even spell the end of Merkel's coalition with her Bavarian allies and Social Democrats (SPD).
The two front runners are Merkel protege and CDU General Secretary Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who leads polls of ordinary voters and party supporters, and Merz, who Bild am Sonntag weekly newspaper said is ahead among CDU delegates.
""A majority for Merz would be the best thing for the country,"" Schaeuble, who was loyal to Merkel as her hardline finance minister but had previously been a rival, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on Wednesday.
Working with Merkel who wants to remain chancellor, the new CDU leader will be influential in shaping German domestic, economic and foreign policy from relations with U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin to helping shape the EU. 
Schaeuble argued that Merz, who lost out to Merkel in a power struggle in 2002 and quit politics for business in 2009, would be able to boost the CDU by giving it a stronger profile and working better with its Bavarian sister party.
Merz, an economic liberal on the right of CDU, has said he wants to halve support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), now on about 15 percent, which capitalized on anger with Merkel's open-door migrant policy.
In a dig at Merkel's cautious approach, Schaeuble said: ""(He) is a man who sends clear signals with clear ideas, who has the courage not to wait for the end of a debate but shape it.""
After deep rows with her Bavarian allies in the summer and heavy losses for the CDU in the state of Hesse in October, Merkel announced she would stand down as party leader but remain chancellor until the 2021 election. That may prove impossible.
Merz, a millionaire who has said he wants ""bold steps"" to strengthen the economic and monetary union, has said he respects Merkel, who has pulled the CDU into the political center ground, and would work with her.
Many commentators are skeptical and it is also unclear if the SPD, also desperate to boost its poll ratings which have slumped to about 14 percent, could work with him.
With the more centrist Kramp-Karrenbauer, a former premier of the tiny state of Saarland, cooperation with Merkel and the SPD would be easier. She insists she is not a Merkel clone, but there is scant evidence she would break with Merkel's main policies.
The third candidate, trailing in all the polls, is Health Minister Jens Spahn, a harsh critic of Merkel's migrant policy. 

With many of the 1,001 delegates undecided, commentators say the speeches given by the candidates at a party conference in Hamburg on Friday before the vote could be crucial.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Istanbul's chief prosecutor has filed warrants for the arrest of a top aide to Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler and the deputy head of its foreign intelligence on suspicion of planning the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, two Turkish officials said on Wednesday.
The prosecutor's office has concluded there is ""strong suspicion"" that Saud al-Qahtani and General Ahmed al-Asiri, both removed from their positions in October, were among the planners of Khashoggi's Oct. 2 killing at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, the officials said. 
The move comes a day after senior U.S. senators said they were more certain than ever that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was responsible for the killing, citing a CIA briefing. The United Nations human rights chief on Wednesday called for an international investigation.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has pushed to keep international attention on the murder - the order for which he says came from the highest levels of the Saudi government - even as U.S. President Donald Trump has said Washington should not take action that would undermine its relationship with the kingdom.
""The prosecution's move to issue arrest warrants for Asiri and Qahtani reflects the view that the Saudi authorities won't take formal action against those individuals,"" one of the Turkish officials said.
""The international community seems to doubt Saudi Arabia's commitment to prosecute this heinous crime. By extraditing all suspects to Turkey, where Jamal Khashoggi was killed and dismembered, the Saudi authorities could address those concerns,"" the official said.
Erdogan has said the order for Khashoggi's killing probably did not come from King Salman, putting the spotlight instead on Salman's heir and de facto ruler Prince Mohammed.
Saudi Arabia has said the prince had no prior knowledge of the murder. After offering numerous contradictory explanations, Riyadh later said Khashoggi had been killed and his body dismembered when negotiations to persuade him to return to Saudi Arabia failed.
'WILLFULLY BLIND'
Making some of their strongest accusations so far, both Republicans and Democrats said they want to pass legislation to send a message to Saudi Arabia that the United States condemns the death of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist.
""You have to be willfully blind not to come to the conclusion that this was orchestrated and organized by people under the command of MbS,"" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters after the meeting with Central Intelligence Agency Director Gina Haspel, referring to the crown prince by his initials.
Graham, who has become one of the president's most vocal allies, said there may not be a ""smoking gun,"" but that there was a ""smoking saw,"" a reference to a bone saw that investigators said was used to cut up Khashoggi's body.
Trump and some of his fellow Republicans have argued that Washington should not take action that would risk its relationship with Riyadh, which is viewed as an important counterweight to Iran in the Middle East.
Erdogan has said that solving the Khashoggi killing would also be in the interest of the Saudi monarchy.
The United States last month imposed economic sanctions on 17 Saudi officials for their role in the killing. Among those sanctioned were Qahtani, who was formerly a top aide to the crown prince.
Qahtani had tried to lure Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia after he moved to Washington a year ago fearing reprisals for his views, according to people close to the journalist and the government.

But Asiri, the former deputy head of foreign intelligence, was not on the sanctions list. Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor has said Asiri was the one who ordered the operation to repatriate - but not kill - Khashoggi.

The defendant, Leong Sze Hian, said on his Facebook page he had ""merely shared"" the article from a Malaysian online news media about Lee and Malaysia's 1MDB state fund without adding any comments or changing the content.
He said he was ""bewildered"" to receive a letter subsequently from lawyers asserting that posting the article was malicious and damaged the reputation of Prime Minister Lee.
""I reject all these allegations categorically,"" he said.
The legal action comes weeks after the Singapore government demanded Facebook remove a separate post by an Australia-based blogger about Singapore's banks and 1MDB, which it said was false and malicious.
Facebook rejected that demand, prompting the Singapore government to say the social media giant could not be relied on to filter false information.
Lee's press secretary, Chang Li Lin, confirmed the prime minister had initiated legal proceedings against Leong for defamation and the matter was in the hands of Lee's lawyers.
""Mr. Lee reserves the right to take legal action against other parties who similarly defame him,"" Chang told Reuters.
Leong, a frequent commentator and critic of government policies, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
But on his Facebook page, he said he had complied with a government request to remove the post, adding it was ""grossly inaccurate"" to say he had ""made a post which was defamatory of the Prime Minister.""
""This article related to the 1MDB saga. I did not add any comments or embellish the article,"" Leong said on Facebook.
1MDB is the subject of money-laundering probes in at least six countries, including the United States, Singapore and Malaysia.
The U.S. Justice Department says an estimated $4.5 billion was misappropriated from the fund by high-level 1MDB officials between 2009 and 2014.

GENEVA (Reuters) - More than 700,000 undocumented Afghans have returned from Iran this year as the Iranian economy tightens, with a knock-on effect on the Afghan economy, according to data from the U.N.'s migration agency.
In a report covering the period up to Dec. 1, the International Organization for Migration said a total of 752,325 Afghans had returned from Iran and Pakistan, including 721,633 from Iran. 
""Undocumented returns from Iran in particular are seeing a massive increase over previous years, largely driven by recent political and economic issues in Iran including massive currency devaluation,"" the IOM report said.
Demand for Afghan labor in Iran's informal economy had drastically fallen, it added. 
""As all Afghans typically send home their earnings in the form of monthly remittances, the Afghan economy itself, already evident in the drought affected provinces of Herat, Badghis and Ghor, is suffering direct and immediate effects."" 
Iranian media reports say many of the Afghans had returned or were seeking to enter Turkey to reach Europe after the fall of the Iranian currency, which has lost about 70 percent of its value this year.
Iran emerged in early 2016 from years of global sanctions under a deal with world powers that curbed its disputed nuclear program.
But U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the deal in May, calling it flawed to Iran's advantage, and reimposed far-reaching U.S. sanctions in phases, with the most damaging oil and banking penalties taking effect on Nov. 5.
Jan Egeland, head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, told Reuters that increasing U.S. pressure on Iran would cause problems for Afghanistan. 
“The Trump sanctions will put the Iranian economy into a void, and is doing that. (The people) who will first lose a grip on their existence are the Afghan registered and unregistered refugees and migrants,"" he said.

BERDYANSK, Ukraine (Reuters) - When the Island Bay cargo ship arrived from Beirut at the Kerch Strait, gateway to the Azov Sea, it sailed into a perfect storm of geopolitics and bad weather.
The following day, Russia opened fire on three Ukrainian naval ships, impounded them and detained their sailors, some of them wounded. It then blocked the strait by putting a tanker underneath a new bridge it has built linking the Russian mainland to the Crimean peninsula it annexed from Ukraine in 2014.
While the world digested the implications of the Nov. 25 incident, the most explosive clash in recent years, Russia said it had reopened the channel to the Azov Sea, which is shared by Russia and Ukraine.
But Island Bay remained at anchor outside the strait, lashed by gale force winds and sleet, its hull icing over while cargo ships amassed on either side.
On Monday, a week on, the captain reported seeing 20 vessels awaiting clearance to cross. Refinitiv data that day also showed 20 Ukraine-bound vessels held up at the strait since Nov. 25, with two others allowed through.
Meanwhile, Island Bay's cargo of 5,500 tonnes of wheat, destined for flour mills in Libya, waited in the Ukrainian port of Berdyansk.
The saga of the ship is a window on the leverage Moscow has over Ukraine's Azov seaboard, affecting dock workers, port operators, brokers and farmers who depend on the route.
Russia, whose coast guards began inspecting traffic in the Kerch Strait eight months ago, blamed inclement weather for the delay. But on Sunday, when the skies cleared, just a handful of ships passed through; by Monday evening, the Island Bay's captain's frustration was beginning to show.
""It is acceptable weather for transit. Coast guards have own opinion,"" his log, seen by Reuters, said. That day, he reported seeing just two ships cross into the Azov Sea.
Ukraine says the hiatus is one of many since the Russian spot-checks began in May, when Russia opened the Kerch bridge, interrupting exports of grain and steel and imports of coal. Moscow denies any disruption.
THE STEVEDORES 
In Berdyansk's port, where icy winds had recently ripped off the roof of a nearby shed, staff of stevedore company Ascet Shipping were reading the daily reports from the Island Bay with growing concern.
Ascet loads almost a million tonnes of Ukrainian grain a year onto cargo ships in Berdyansk and was waiting to load the Island Bay; its size means each day of waiting time costs around $2,000-$2,500, Ascet's chief executive, Denis Rusin, said.
This has made Berdyansk an unpopular port in recent months. 
""Ship owners do not want to go to Berdyansk,"" said Rusin, whose clients include U.S. firm Cargill (CARG.UL), one of the world's largest dry bulk and tank shipping companies. ""Buyers are refusing to bet on passage.""
Since Russia and Ukraine clashed in the strait, Ukraine has introduced martial law in 10 regions, including the Azov Sea coast - highlighting the risks of doing business with Berdyansk.
""For us this was the worst week in recent years,"" Rusin said. ""Clients have stopped considering the possibility of signing contracts for delivery in January, let alone February or spring,"" he said.
THE PORT
Some Ukrainian politicians have accused Moscow of trying to strangle Ukraine's Azov Sea ports in preparation for an invasion from the east, following on from Crimea's annexation and the subsequent breakaway of Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine.
Moscow says that idea is a fantasy dreamt up by Ukraine's pro-Western leaders ahead of elections next year. It says it has the right to patrol the strait.
But Berdyansk's businesses say the patrols target ships bound for Ukraine, causing damaging delays. 
The recent escalation in tensions has not affected ships coming to pick up grain from the Russian side of the Azov Sea, according to Sergei Filipov, director of trading firm QAM7 Dubai, which has operations there. He said inspections have delayed travel by the usual two or three days.
On its eleventh day at anchor in Kerch Strait, with skies finally clear, Island Bay reported to Berdyansk: ""We called everywhere to make guards (come and) inspect the vessel, but their intentions cannot be explained.""
The situation has sent Rusin racing to further revise down his business forecasts.
Climbing out onto the windswept roof of his office on Friday, he pointed to a single truck of grain where multiple trucks used to line up along the dock.
""We had expected to load around 150,000 tonnes over the next three months... Maybe 200,000,"" he said. Now the company is preparing for anything between 50,000 tonnes and no business at all, he said.
""This was a change of plan that happened this week.""
The Azov Sea grain supply chain makes up just 2 to 3 percent of Ukraine's agricultural exports, deputy central bank chief Dmitry Sologub said. But for the southeastern Zaporozhye region, home to 1.8 million people, it is critical.
At the government Port Authority in Berdyansk, officials said they feared for the port's future as clients look to other locations with direct access to the Black Sea.
""Of course we would prefer (to use other ports),"" said Erdem Sekreter, fleet manager at Turkey's Bayraktar shipping group, which has two ships waiting to cross the Kerch Strait to reach the Ukrainian coast. 
""It is getting more expensive for ship-owners to go to the Azov Sea – the Ukrainian side of course,"" he added. ""We are paying out of our pocket now.""
FARMERS AND TRADERS
Bison Group owns 40,000 hectares of arable land in Zaporozhye region and exports much of its harvest via Berdyansk.
With ship-owners raising freight charges to factor in the new risks in the Azov Sea, the costs will be passed down to grain producers, Bison deputy director Igor Serov said. ""It hits agricultural producers really hard.""
Prices will have to go down by at least $10 per tonne, a trader at Atria Brokers, which handles Berdyansk grain, said.
But producers may not have other options. The railway infrastructure is not in place to send exports via Black Sea ports instead, Serov said, and transferring grain by truck to Odessa, for example, would cost an extra $40 per tonne.
Buyers are also pulling back, afraid of the risks. 
""Our sales have fallen,"" the Atria trader said. ""It has affected us in a fundamental way.""
Every day Island Bay's cargo sits in port, it racks up costs for traders. Grain can spoil, and storage costs are steep.
""The market is suffering... everyone along the chain is paying the price for these war games,"" a grain trader said, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation. 
On Tuesday, Ukraine's agriculture ministry said some grain shipments from the Azov Sea had resumed. 
Five of the 14 ships headed to the Ukrainian port of Mariupol, held up since the stand-off, were still waiting to cross on Wednesday, Refinitiv data showed. One had turned back to Istanbul.
In comparison, of the ships aiming for one of Russian city Rostov-on-Don's ports, that had arrived to Kerch Strait since the stand-off began, none were still waiting for passage, the data showed the same day.
Only one out of the six boats headed to Berdyansk had crossed by Wednesday. After twelve days at anchor in the waters near the strait, Island Bay was still waiting.

Around 100,000 people died during the war in Bosnia, during which Bosnian Muslims fought Bosnian Serbs and then Croats.
General Ramiz Drekovic, 62, a retired commander of the 4th Corps of the Bosnian Muslim-led army, is suspected of ordering attacks on a southeastern village, during which a 15-year-old was killed and more people injured and properties destroyed, the prosecutor's office said in a statement.
""The suspect is charged with issuing direct, strictly confidential orders to artillery units on a wider area of Konjic municipality to randomly shell the village of Kalinovik, inhabited by Serbs, in spring 1995,"" the statement said.
His lawyer, Mirsad Crnovršanin, confirmed to state television that Drekovic was arrested on Wednesday morning in his Sarajevo apartment and has been questioned by the police. 
Drekovic faces charges of acting against the provisions of the Geneva Convention and of committing war crimes.

Two submarines, the Rostov-on-Don B-237 and the Stary Oskol B-262, practiced emergency deployments for detecting, accompanying and destroying sea and coastal targets with rocket fire, the Defense Ministry said. 
Submarine crews from the Black sea fleet were also due to practice deep dives and to work on techniques such as emergency surfacing, it said. 
The statement did not give a start or end date for the drills or say if the submarine exercises were part of larger-scale drills in the Black Sea and on the Crimean peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. 
A navigation warning to shipping published by littoral state Turkey's navy said that ""firing exercises"" were expected in the region from Dec. 3 to Dec. 9. 
Separately, Pantsir medium-range surface-to-air missile systems in the east of Crimea practiced detecting, identifying and shooting down aerial targets, Interfax news agency cited a spokesman for the Black Sea Fleet as saying.
The exercises come at a time of heightened tensions between Russia and the West over Russia's seizure on Nov. 25 of two small Ukrainian armored artillery vessels and a tug boat and their crews.
NATO foreign ministers discussed the Black Sea region with Ukraine and Georgia's foreign ministers on Tuesday while NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the U.S.-led military alliance had boosted its presence there in response to what he said were Russia's aggressive actions.

""I am glad that my friend @EmmanuelMacron and the protestors in Paris have agreed with the conclusion I reached two years ago,"" Trump tweeted late on Tuesday.
""The Paris Agreement is fatally flawed because it raises the price of energy for responsible countries while whitewashing some of the worst polluters,"" said Trump, referring to a global deal on the environment drafted in Paris in late 2015.

48,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2018 04:16AM ET</span>",Indonesian soldier killed in separatist attack in Papua,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - A soldier has been killed in Indonesia's eastern province of Papua where security forces are hunting for a separatist group suspected of killing at least 19 workers building a bridge, a military spokesman said on Wednesday.
The killing of the workers is one of the worst outbreaks of violence in years in Papua, home to a simmering separatist conflict since it was incorporated into Indonesia after a widely criticized U.N.-backed referendum in 1969. 
Colonel Muhammad Aidi said the number of workers killed in the attack had been revised down to 19 from 24, based on the latest accounts from four survivors. 
The survivors were followed by separatist militants to a military post where a soldier was killed in a gunfight, Aidi said by telephone from Papua.
""The TNI (Indonesian military) post was attacked on Monday morning by a significant number of the armed group using military grade weapons, as well as spears and arrows,"" he said. 
Aidi said on Tuesday a construction worker who took a photograph of separatists celebrating what they consider their independence day appears to have sparked the killings.
Some Papuans regard Dec. 1 as their independence day from Dutch colonial rule and hold rallies or raise separatist flags banned by the Jakarta government.
The military arm of the separatist group, the Free Papua Movement (OPM), said on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page on Wednesday it viewed the workers as members of the military and casualties of a war against the Indonesian government.
Indonesia officials say the workers were civilians employed by state construction firm, PT Istaka Karya, which is building bridges for the Trans Papua highway.
Since coming to power in 2014, President Joko Widodo has pledged to hasten development and open up access to the resource-rich province, including the Trans Papua road project to link remote areas. 
Widodo said on Wednesday security for construction projects in Papua would be addressed by his government.
""The construction of the Trans Papua road needs to be continued and will never be stopped,"" he told reporters. 

While separatists have been blamed for carrying out attacks, Indonesia's human rights commission has also urged Widodo to end rights violations by security forces in Papua.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's top diplomat promised on Tuesday a new democratic world order in which Washington will strengthen or jettison international agreements as it sees fit to stop ""bad actors"" such as Russia, China and Iran from gaining.
In a twist on Trump's ""America First"" policy, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Trump was not abandoning its global leadership but instead reshaping the post-World War Two system on the basis of sovereign states, not multilateral institutions.
""In the finest traditions of our great democracy, we are rallying the noble nations to build a new liberal order that prevents war and achieves greater prosperity,"" Pompeo told diplomats and officials in a foreign policy speech.
""We are acting to preserve, protect, and advance an open, just, transparent and free world of sovereign states,"" Pompeo said, adding that China's ability to benefit from the current U.S.-led system of trade and other agreements was an example of ""the poisoned fruit of American retreat.""
Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Pompeo's statements ""did not accord with the spirit"" of the meeting just days earlier between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Argentina.
""I don't know for what purpose someone would applaud then and now say something like this,"" Geng said, referring to media reports that applause broke out after Xi and Trump agreed to a trade war ceasefire at their meeting in Argentina.
Geng said that while the United States ""flies the flag of America First, and wields the baton of protectionism and unilateralism"", China was an important contributor to multilateralism, the international rules-based order and global economic development.
Pompeo, a former Army officer who is regarded as a Trump loyalist with hawkish world views, said Trump was also pushing both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to stop funding countries such as China, saying they already had access to financial markets to raise capital.
Pompeo's address, which was met with polite applause, rejected concerns among many traditional U.S. allies that Trump is undermining the West by withdrawing from climate, free-trade and arms control accords. 
Pompeo said such criticism was ""plain wrong.""
Pompeo said Trump was reforming the liberal order, not destroying it. He cited Britain's decision to quit the European Union as a sign supranational organizations were not working.
He also took aim at ""bureaucrats"" responsible for upholding multilateralism ""as an end in itself"" and cast doubt on the EU's commitment to its citizens.
That drew a rare rebuke from the European Commission, the bloc's executive.
Asked to reply to the Secretary of State's remarks, its chief spokesman offered an explanation of how the EU executive is subject to control by citizens via the directly elected European Parliament and by the governments of the member states.
""So for those people who come to Brussels and coin an opinion without knowing how our system works, that's how our system works. And that's our reply,"" Margaritis Schinas said.
NUCLEAR TREATY WITHDRAWAL
Pompeo's speech marks the latest attempt by a Trump official to place the president's decisions into a coherent policy plan, after visits to Brussels by his vice president and other senior U.S. officials. 
European leaders are troubled by Trump's rhetoric and say that his decision to pull out of the Paris climate change accord and the 2015 Iran nuclear deal undermine European priorities. 
Alluding to Trump's policies in a speech on Monday in Cambridge, Massachusetts, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini warned of ""the rule of the jungle"" replacing the rule of law. 
Pompeo said the United States was acting correctly.
""Our administration is ... lawfully exiting or renegotiating outdated or harmful treaties, trade agreements, and other international arrangements that don't serve our sovereign interests, or the interest of our allies,"" he said.
Under pressure from Washington, the U.S.-led NATO alliance is expected later on Tuesday to declare Russia in formal breach of a nuclear arms control treaty, paving the way for Trump to withdraw from the Cold War-era agreement.
NATO's European allies have pressed Trump not to follow through with his threat to quit the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty with Moscow, signed in 1987, but instead to work to bring Russia into compliance with the pact.

However, diplomats said they were now trying to limit the fallout of the decision by staggering the expected U.S. withdrawal into next year and first formally accusing Russia of breaking the INF agreement, which rid Europe of land-based nuclear missiles. Russia denies violation of the pact.

The official news agency IRNA said lawmakers had included amendments requested by a powerful clerical body, which must vet all legislation passed through parliament before it becomes actual law.
Supporters hope the legislation, once passed, will allow Iran to join an international convention against the funding of terrorism and comply with measures against money laundering set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).
Hardliners in parliament have opposed parts of the legislation, saying it could hamper Iranian financial support for allies such as Lebanon’s Hezbollah, which the United States has classified as a terrorist group.
The Guardian Council clerical body had asked lawmakers to include clauses including a guarantee that the law would not clash with the constitution.
The Paris-based FATF said in October that Iran had until February to complete reforms that would bring it into line with global norms or face consequences.
Foreign businesses say legislation that includes FATF guidelines is essential if they are to increase investment.

Many Western companies have already ceased cooperation with Iran after the United States pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal between world powers and Tehran in May and reimposed sanctions.

The Navarra court confirmed a nine-year prison sentence for the men, who joked about the 2016 incident afterwards on a WhatsApp group called ""The Wolf Pack"", for the lesser crime of sexual assault. 
The incident, which has attracted international attention in the wake of the #MeToo movement, occurred during the annual San Fermin bull-running festival in Pamplona, the capital of Navarra. 
The ruling, which can now be appealed in Spain's Supreme Court, saw the men released on bail in June on a legal technicality which says that no one can be held for more than two years without a definitive sentence being handed down.
All five men, who include a former policeman and a former soldier, paid 6,000 euros ($6,800) in bail though their release led to further protests and concern across the political spectrum with pledges to revise the penal system's response to such charges.
The state prosecutor had originally asked for sentences of more than 20 years each for rape, which in Spain requires a plaintiff to present evidence of specific violence, such as being threatened with a knife or dealt physical blows.

The quake https://tmsnrt.rs/2QdrtkL of magnitude 7.6, which struck east of New Caledonia, was just 10 km (6 miles) deep and about 155 km (95 miles) east-southeast of the Loyalty Islands, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre said.
Authorities in the French territory urged people to move to locations more than 300 meters (984 ft) away from the shore, and if possible, to sites higher than 12 meters (39 ft) above sea level.

Somalia has been trying to recover from the conflict that engulfed the country in 1991, when clan warlords overthrew a dictator and then turned on each other.
""This historic event reflects Somalia's progress in recent years and is another step forward in formalizing U.S. diplomatic engagement in Mogadishu,"" the State Department said in a statement late on Tuesday.
Somalia has in recent years faced an insurgency by the al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab militant group, as well as famine and maritime piracy.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A justice foundation created by George and Amal Clooney is set to announce on Wednesday a global initiative called TrialWatch to monitor court trials where there is a risk of abuse and to rank countries' judicial systems. 
Working with the Columbia University Law School and the American Bar Association, the TrialWatch initiative will train an international network of court monitors, including non-lawyers, whose reports will be used by legal experts to grade trials according to international standards, several lawyers and academics involved with TrialWatch said.
""Today, courts all over the world are used as tools of oppression. Governments get away too easily with imprisoning opposition figures, silencing critics and persecuting vulnerable groups through the courts. Trial monitoring will shine a light on these abuses,"" Amal Clooney said in a statement.
Amal Clooney, who married the Oscar-winning actor George Clooney in 2014, is an international law and human rights lawyer who has been a visiting professor at Columbia University Law School since 2015. She and her husband launched the Clooney Foundation for Justice, which focuses on promoting justice in courtrooms and elsewhere, in 2016.
Her high profile cases have included representing Wikileaks founder, Julian Assange, and the former Prime Minister of Ukraine, Yulia Tymoshenko, as well as the country of Armenia in its fight for recognition of the Armenian genocide.
She currently is a member of the legal team representing Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who were detained last year by Myanmar authorities while investigating the killing of 10 men and boys of the Rohingya minority during a military crackdown.

Australia selected France's Naval Group in 2016 as its preferred bidder for a fleet of 12 submarines, then one of the world's most lucrative defense contracts, ahead of other offers from Japan and Germany.
More than two years on, final contracts have yet to be signed, and Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported Canberra was willing to accept costs rising by 25 percent and the first vessel to arrive two years late.
The first of the new submarines is scheduled to be delivered in the early 2030s and the final vessel during the 2050s.
Pyne rejected the report, insisting the Strategic Partnering Agreement, the overall contract to guide the construction, would be signed by mid-December.
""There has never been a suggestion by the Commonwealth that there should be, or could be, a 25 percent cost blow-out or a two-year delay, as part of the negotiations,"" Pyne told reporters in Canberra.
Australia rejected offers from Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Germany's ThyssenKrupp AG when it selected the French bid.

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors announced Tuesday that they have charged four people with taking part in a decades-long scheme to evade U.S. taxes that came to light after a massive leak of offshore financial data known as the ""Panama Papers.""
Three of the four people have already been arrested, prosecutors said, in the first criminal case brought by U.S. authorities in connection with Mossack Fonseca & Co, the Panamanian law firm at the center of the leak.
Harald Joachim von der Goltz, a client of the firm, was arrested in London on Monday; Dirk Brauer, an employee of an asset management company closely tied to the firm, was arrested in Paris on Nov. 15; and Richard Gaffey, a U.S.-based accountant, was arrested in Massachusetts on Tuesday, according to prosecutors.
The fourth defendant, Ramses Owens, was a lawyer at Mossack Fonseca and remains at large, prosecutors said. The law firm shut down earlier this year.
Bill Lovett, a lawyer for Gaffey, could not immediately be reached for comment. Lawyers for the other three defendants could not immediately be identified.
The most serious charges in the case, which include wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy, carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.
In an indictment unsealed in Manhattan federal court, prosecutors said that from 2000 to 2017, Owens and Brauer conspired to help clients of Mossack Fonseca conceal assets, investments and income from U.S. tax authorities, using sham foundations and shell companies formed under the law of countries including Panama, Hong Kong and the British Virgin Islands. Owens, 50, is a citizen of Panama and Brauer, 54, is German citizen, prosecutors said.
One of those clients was von Der Goltz, an 81-year-old German citizen, according to the indictment. Prosecutors said that Owens and Gaffey helped von Der Goltz avoid taxes by creating shell companies and bank accounts that he falsely claimed were solely owned by his elderly mother, a Guatemalan citizen who did not pay U.S. taxes.
Prosecutors also said that Gaffey, a 74-year-old U.S. citizen, helped another unnamed client of the Mossack Fonseca conceal offshore bank accounts from U.S. authorities.
The ""Panama Papers"", which consist of millions of documents from Mossack Fonseca, were leaked to the media in April 2016.

A review of the documents also prompted German authorities to raid the offices of  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) and its board members as part of a money laundering investigation last week.

SEOUL (Reuters) - When Seoul was preparing to open a liaison office in the North Korean city of Kaesong this summer after a decade of virtually no contact with its longtime enemy, South Korean officials had heated debates over whether they should seek approval from Washington. 
Some top aides to President Moon Jae-in stressed it was an issue for the two Koreas alone and there was no need to involve their U.S. ally, two people with knowledge of the situation told Reuters. 
But to the surprise of several officials at the meeting, Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon argued Washington must be consulted because Seoul's plans might run afoul of sanctions imposed on North Korea over its nuclear weapons program.
Two dozen countries including the Britain, Germany and Sweden already have embassies in Pyongyang, and other officials saw the proposed liaison office as a far lower-level of contact with the North.
And they certainly did not expect Cho to be a leading advocate of strict enforcement of sanctions. Cho was Moon's personal choice to head the ministry, whose prime mission is to foster reconciliation, cooperation and eventual reunification with the North. 
Cho, whose 30 year public service history has been inextricably linked to reunification, was even sacked from the ministry in 2008 over his ""dovish"" stance toward Pyongyang.
At the suggestion of Cho and senior diplomats, Seoul ultimately sought U.S. consent before opening the office in September, one of the sources said.
All the sources spoke to condition of anonymity due to sensitivity of the matter. 
Cho declined to comment for this article, but a senior official at the Unification Ministry said it was aware of criticisms of Cho.
""Inter-Korean ties are unique in their nature, but it's been difficult, and there's North Korea's duplicity. It's a dilemma we face, or our fate,"" the official said, asking not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.
(Korea: a land divided - https://tmsnrt.rs/2KdXMcS) 
CHIEF NEGOTIATOR, OR ROADBLOCK?
The previously unreported debate among Moon's top officials illustrates a growing divide within South Korea over how to progress relations with the North while keeping Washington on side.
Some corners of the administration argue Seoul can't afford to be seen veering from the U.S.-led sanctions and pressure campaign until Pyongyang gives up its nuclear weapons program, while others feel closer inter-Korean ties can help expedite the stalled diplomatic process, several officials close to the situation say.
""If the internal rift leads to moving too quickly with the North without sufficient U.S. consultations, it could pose a setback to not only the nuclear talks but also the alliance and inter-Korean relations,"" said Shin Beom-chul, a senior fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. 
After the inter-Korean thaw gave way to reconciliation efforts between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this year, Trump asked Moon to be ""chief negotiator"" between the two. 
That task has become increasingly difficult as Washington and Pyongyang blame each other for the faltering nuclear talks. 
U.S. officials insist punishing sanctions must remain until North Korea completely denuclearises. North Korea says it has already made concessions by dismantling key facilities and Washington must reciprocate by easing sanctions and declaring an end to the 1950-53 Korean War.
""Unlike other advisers, Minister Cho has balanced his staunch desire for peace with an understanding of the importance of retaining a strong South Korea-U.S. alignment,"" said Patrick Cronin of the Centre for a New American Security, an Asia expert in close touch with both U.S. and South Korean officials.
""Some alliance discord is inevitable and not worrisome. What would be worrisome would be a clear rupture in South Korea-U.S. approaches for managing North Korea.""
The presidential Blue House declined to comment, but Moon told reporters on Monday the view that there was discord between South Korea and the United States was ""groundless"" because there is no difference in the two countries' positions on the North's denuclearization.
SLOW PROGRESS, MOUNTING FRUSTRATION
A third source familiar with the presidential office's thinking said there was mounting frustration with Cho within the Blue House and even inside the Unification Ministry amid concerns he worried too much about U.S. views.
""What the president would want from him as the unification minister is to come up with bold ideas to make his pet initiatives happen,"" the source said.
During three summits this year, Moon and Kim agreed to re-link railways and roads, and when conditions are met, restart the joint factory park in Kaesong and tours to the North's Mount Kumgang resort that have been suspended for years. 
None of those plans have made much headway, either because sanctions ban them outright, or as in the case of Kaesong, Seoul took time to convince skeptical U.S. officials that cross-border projects wouldn't undermine sanctions.
North Korea itself has been an unpredictable partner. Discussions through the Kaesong office have been few and far between, with Pyongyang's negotiators often failing to show up for scheduled weekly meetings without notice, Unification Ministry officials say. 
Even so, the Kaesong move has caused tensions with Washington.
U.S. officials told Seoul that South Korea's explanations on the Kaesong office were not ""satisfactory,"" the South's Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha told a parliamentary hearing in August.
Washington was also caught off guard when a group of businessmen who used to operate factories in the now-closed Kaesong industrial park were invited for the opening ceremony of the office, a diplomatic source in Seoul said.
The allies launched a working group last month led by their nuclear envoys to coordinate North Korean policy. It was borne out of U.S. desire to ""keep inter-Korean relations in check,"" the source said.
Asked about the Kaesong office, a U.S. State Department official said: ""We expect all member states to fully implement U.N. sanctions, including sectoral goods banned under UN Security Council resolution, and expect all nations to take their responsibilities seriously to help end (North Korea's) illegal nuclear and missile programs.""
Another State official said the United States endorsed April's inter-Korean summit agreement during its own summit with North Korea ""because progress on inter-Korean relations must happen in lockstep with progress on denuclearization.""
Last month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met Cho in Washington, bluntly warning him that inter-Korean cooperation and progress on nuclear negotiations should ""remain aligned.""
ROCK AND A HARD PLACE
Even as he faced pressure from Washington to hold a tough line, Cho was being criticized for dragging his feet on reconciliation.
In May, the North called off planned talks with the South led by Cho in protest against U.S.-South Korean air combat exercises. When the meeting eventually took place, Cho's counterpart, Ri Son Gwon, openly blamed Cho for having caused a ""grave situation"" that resulted in the cancellation of the talks. 
At the Kaesong office opening, factory owners pressed Cho to reopen the complex and said they were dismayed at the Unification Ministry for repeatedly rejecting requests to visit the border city to check on equipment and facilities idled since the 2016 shutdown.
""We've expressed, directly and indirectly, our complaint that the minister may be too lukewarm about our requests, even though allowing the trip has nothing to do with sanctions,"" said Shin Han-yong, who chairs a group of businessmen with plants in Kaesong.
Cho recently told the parliament the delays are due to scheduling issues with the North, adding the ministry ""needs more time to explain the overall circumstances"" to the international community.
Shin, the expert at Asan, warned any move to undermine sanctions may expose South Korean companies to risks of punishment.
After Moon and Kim's summit in Pyongyang in September, a senior U.S. Treasury official called compliance officers at seven South Korean banks to warn them that resuming financial cooperation with North Korea ""does not align with U.S. policies"" and the banks must comply with U.N. and U.S. financial sanctions, according to a South Korean regulatory document.
""Realistically we have no option but to consider U.S. positions, as the top priority is the North's denuclearization and the United States has the biggest leverage on that,"" said Kim Hyung-suk, who served as vice unification minister until last year.

""Without progress on the nuclear issues, there would be constraints at some point in sustaining inter-Korean ties. And Minister Cho knows that.""

63,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2018 08:40PM ET</span>",Spain PM changes tack on budget timing after regional election jolt,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Tuesday his government was planning to put forward a proposal for the 2019 budget in January, changing strategy after an electoral setback on Sunday in a Socialist stronghold.
Spain's political landscape has been upended by the unprecedented election of 12 far-right lawmakers in the southern Andalusia regional parliament on Sunday, prompting Sanchez to have another go at putting a budget proposal to parliament. 
""We are going to fulfill our task, which is to present the budget, and I announce that the cabinet in January will approve the proposal,"" Sanchez said during a televised interview on private TV channel Telecinco.
The Socialists hold a minority in parliament and need the support of smaller parties to pass legislation.
The government had reached a tentative deal on the 2019 budget with anti-austerity party Podemos in October, but had stopped short of putting it to parliament because Catalan nationalists, whose votes it needed, refused to back it.
The lack of support from Catalan nationalists, who favor seceding from Spain and were asking for concessions from Sanchez in return for any support on the budget, had prompted the government to consider ruling by decree on budgetary issues.
But the government might now be hoping that the success of center-right and far-right parties that strongly oppose Catalan nationalists might convince the latter to be more accommodating.
Without a budget, Sanchez could be forced to call an early election.
Asked if the Socialist government could call a snap election before the legislature ends in 2020 if he failed to get support from the opposition for his budget, Sanchez declined to answer, saying he was focusing on the budget.
Sanchez also used the interview to challenge the conservative People's Party and center-right Ciudadanos on a possible deal with the far-right Vox to rule Andalusia.
Vox espouses tougher immigration policies and a weaker European Union.
""Parties that call themselves pro-European cannot ... base their (regional) government on a resolutely anti-European force like Vox,"" Sanchez said. 

Looking at a possible alliance between Ciudadanos and French President Emmanuel Macron's party in EU elections in May, Sanchez said he wondered how Ciudadanos chief Albert Rivera would explain a deal with Vox to Macron, who bills himself as a top adversary of the far-right.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's Unification Ministry, responsible for inter-Korean affairs, has seen its standing wax and wane along with relations between the still officially warring neighbors.
The ministry returned to prominence this year after three summits between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ended with pledges to defuse military tensions, restart economic cooperation and formally end the 1950-53 Korean War. 
But those efforts have placed the ministry in a bind, with Washington wary of rapid progress between the two Koreas that may undermine international sanctions and efforts to dismantle the North's nuclear and missile programs. 
Here is a summary of the ministry's history, mission and how its work has evolved in line with changes in domestic political tides and diplomatic dynamics. 
ONE OF A KIND
The South's full-fledged Unification Ministry is the only one of its kind in the world, with its northern counterpart being the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Country. 
Amid fears Pyongyang might forcibly reunify the peninsula, former military dictator Park Chung-hee created the ministry's 45-strong precursor in 1969, at the height of the Cold War, as a public propaganda body against the North. 
Research papers issued by the agency in 1969 included ""Communist forces and their strategy in Far East,"" ""The North Korean puppet regime's Japan policy"" and ""Communist China's Asia policy and Korea reunification,"" the National Archives of Korea show. 
An educational video distributed by the agency in 1972 explores how to utilize North Korean defectors in the South and pro-Pyongyang Korean residents in Japan for ""psychological warfare"" against the North.
""For the Park regime, unification was a good excuse to heighten wariness against the North and justify its military rule,"" said Chung Se-hyun, who joined the ministry in 1977 and served as minister from 2002 to 2004.
HEYDAY AND DECLINE
As relations thawed in the early 1970s, the unification agency's role evolved to include cross-border dialogue and exchanges.
The ministry expanded its duties in the 1990s, studying human rights abuses in North Korea and helping resettle defectors who fled amid a devastating famine in the mid-1990s.
The ministry's heyday came under liberal presidents Kim Dae-jung, who upgraded its status to full-fledged ministry in 1998, and his successor Roh Moo-hyun. 
It played a pivotal role when Kim and Roh met with North Korea's late leader Kim Jong Il, for summits in 2000 and 2007 respectively, in Pyongyang. Staffing grew to 550 by 2007.
But a series of incidents and attacks and the North's pursuit of nuclear-armed missiles, followed by international sanctions and the halt of joint economic projects, saw the ministry's influence wane. 
In 2008, newly elected conservative president Lee Myung-bak cut staff by 15 percent. In 2016, his conservative successor Park Geun-hye, shut down the Kaesong joint industrial park in the North, the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean rapprochement.
NEW WIND AND DILEMMA
Moon, a former chief of staff to Roh and who prepared him for the 2007 inter-Korean summit, took office in May 2017 vowing to restore dialogue. 
Moon wants to build an inter-Korean economic community, under a multibillion-dollar ""New Korean Peninsula Economic Map"". It envisions joint industrial zones and transportation links, including by reopening the Kaesong factory park and resuming tours to the North's Mount Kumkang resort. 
Moon's reconciliation policy has given a renewed sense of purpose to the 560-strong ministry, but at the same time posed a dilemma over how to proceed with inter-Korean initiatives while advancing nuclear talks between Pyongyang and Washington. 
Kim Jong Un vowed to work toward denuclearization in his June summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, but the two countries have since failed to agree on a specific timeline or concrete steps to reach that goal in their subsequent negotiations.

""Activities by hostile states can have a corrosive effect on our democratic systems and institutions,"" said David Vigneault, head of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.
Vigneault said the scale, speed, range and impact of foreign interference had grown as a result of the internet, social media platforms and the availability of cheaper and more accessible cyber tools.
""Terrorism has understandably occupied a significant portion of our collective attention for almost two decades,"" he said in a speech in Toronto.
""Nevertheless, other national security threats – such as foreign interference, cyber threats and espionage – pose greater strategic challenges and must also be addressed.""
Vigneault said hostile foreign intelligence services were gathering political, economic, commercial, and military information in Canada.
In particular, he said, CSIS had seen a trend of state-sponsored espionage in fields such as artificial intelligence, clean technology and the fifth-generation mobile network.
Although Vigneault did not single out any nation, Western governments are increasingly wary of what they say is possible Chinese state involvement in 5G and other communications networks.

Vicuna's resignation was the second time a vice president left since Moreno took office in May 2017. Moreno on Monday assigned Secretary General Jose Augusto Briones with the duties of vice president, without specifying for how long. 
Prosecutors are investigating funds that Vicuna received from a former adviser between 2011 and 2013 while she was a legislator for former leftist president Rafael Correa's Country Alliance (AP) party. Moreno said he took the decision so she could defend herself, but she had remained in office until resigning.
""The President of the Republic has reiterated his concern for me. I understand that relieving me of duties was a way to ensure my legitimate right to defense,"" Vicuna wrote in a public letter.
Last week, Vicuna acknowledged receiving the payments, but said they were voluntary contributions for a political organization aligned with the AP. She said she refused the adviser's requests to be named to government posts and as a result is now ""a victim of slander."" 
Vicuna, previously urban development minister, replaced former Vice President Jorge Glas last year while he was under investigation in a corruption scandal centered on Brazilian construction company Odebrecht, which has admitted paying bribes to win infrastructure contracts across Latin America. [nL2N1MF23F]
Glas, a close ally of Correa, was later found guilty and sentenced to six years in jail on charges he pocketed a roughly $13.5 million bribe from Odebrecht. [nL1N1OD2T6]

Moreno ran for president with Correa's endorsement but has largely broken with his predecessor's populist approach in favor of a more orthodox, market-friendly economic policy.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The United States delivered Russia a 60-day ultimatum on Tuesday to come clean about what Washington says is a violation of a arms control treaty that keeps missiles out of Europe, saying only Moscow could save the pact.
NATO allies led by Germany pressed U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at a meeting in Brussels to give diplomacy a final push before Washington pulls out of the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, fearing a new arms race in Europe.
""Russia has a last chance to show in a verifiable way that they comply with the treaty ... but we also have to start to prepare for the fact that this treaty may break down,"" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters.
NATO foreign ministers agreed to formally declare Russia in ""material breach"" of the INF treaty in a statement in support of the United States, after Pompeo briefed them at the alliance headquarters in Brussels on Russian violations and on U.S. President Donald Trump's stated aim to withdraw from it. 
Russia denies undertaking any such development of land-based, intermediate-range Cruise missile capable of carrying nuclear warheads and hitting European cities at short notice. 
Germany, the Netherlands and Belgian are concerned about the deployment of U.S. missiles in Europe - as happened in the 1980s, touching off large anti-American demonstrations - while being caught up in nuclear competition between Moscow and Washington.
A U.S. exit from the INF treaty would put another strain on NATO allies already shaken by Trump's demands for higher defense spending and what diplomats say is a lack of clarity about where U.S. strategy is heading on the issue.
While Stoltenberg said there would now be an intense diplomatic push to try to convince Russia to give up what Pompeo said were ""multiple battalions of the SSC-8 missiles"", Washington is set to start to pull out in February, prompting a six-month withdrawal period under the accord, diplomats said.
""Its range makes it a direct menace to Europe,"" Pompeo said of the missiles, which also are called Novator 9M729. He added that Russia's actions ""greatly undermine America's national security and that of our allies"". 
Difficult to detect and fired from mobile launchers, the Russian missiles are especially dangerous because they reduce the warning time that NATO air defenses might have to shoot them down, military experts say. 
Pompeo said the U.S. government had raised the issue at least 30 times since 2013 with Moscow but had faced what he said were denials and counter-actions. 
He also said that the United States had evidence that the test launches were from a single site in Russia, the Soviet-era base Kupustin Yar, near Volgograd, southeast of Moscow. 
""In the light of these facts, the United States declares Russia in material breach of the treaty and will suspend our obligations ... effective in 60 days unless Russia returns to full and verifiable compliance,"" Pompeo said.
EUROPE CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE
Washington has said it would be forced to restore the military balance in Europe after the 60-day period but Pompeo declined to elaborate, saying only that tests and deployments of new missiles were on hold until then.
He also said that because China, Iran and North Korea were not signatories to the INF, the United States was putting itself at a disadvantage by not developing medium-range missiles, citing three failed diplomatic attempts to enlarge the treaty.
However, experts believe the United States would be better off modernizing its long-range missile deterrent and ensuring that it could penetrate sophisticated Russian air defenses, rather than developing a new class of medium-range rockets.
The INF treaty, negotiated by then-President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and ratified by the U.S. Senate, eliminated the medium-range missile arsenals of the world's two biggest nuclear powers and reduced their ability to launch a nuclear strike at short notice.
U.S. Cruise and Pershing missiles deployed in Britain and West Germany were removed as a result of the treaty, while the Soviet Union pulled back its SS-20s out of European range.

The treaty requires the United States and Russia ""not to possess, produce, or flight-test"" a ground-launched cruise missile with a range capability of 500 km to 5,500 km (310-3,420 miles), ""or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A key accused and alleged middleman in India's abortive, scandal-tainted helicopter deal with Anglo-Italian firm Agusta Westland was extradited to India from Dubai late on Tuesday, according to local media.
The Indian federal Police said earlier in the day that Christian Michel would arrive in New Delhi and be taken into custody by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) before being presented in court on Wednesday. 
The CBI alleges that Michel paid bribes to senior Indian government officials to secure the chopper deal for Agusta in 2010. He has denied the accusations.
His extradition is a victory for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government in its fight against corruption and apprehending fugitives abroad. 
Michel is particularly important to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as the accusations against him relate to the period when the opposition and bitter foe Congress was in power. 
The timing is also right for the BJP as it girds for a no-holds barred fight against Congress in elections just a few months away.
A statement from Indian federal police said it learnt of Michel's alleged involvement in the deal in 2012 but when it acted to investigate his role he fled the country. 
The CBI has alleged that Michel, who was a consultant to Agusta at the time, entered into as many as 12 contracts through two of his firms to legitimize the bribes paid to officials to secure the 556 million euro deal for the 12 AW101 helicopters. India canceled the deal in 2013. 
A warrant for his arrest was issued in September 2015 and he was taken into custody in the United Arab Emirates in February 2017 after the CBI issued a red notice to Interpol.
The police statement said that Michel would be examined with respect to his involvement in the case and confronted with documents received by the CBI that indicate the bribes he is alleged to have paid. Formal charges will hinge on the outcome of the CBI investigation.

The cabinet had tendered its resignation on Sunday to King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa as required by law after parliamentary elections in the Gulf Arab state.
Sheikh Salman bin Khalifa Al Khalifa replaced Sheikh Ahmed bin Mohammed Al Khalifa as finance minister, according to a statement carried by the state Bahrain News Agency.
Sheikh Khalifa, 83, has served as the prime minister of Bahrain, home to the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, since the Sunni Muslim-led island kingdom declared independence from Britain in 1971.
Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa retained his post as foreign minister and Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifa Al Khalifa as oil minister.
Bahrain, which does not possess vast oil wealth like other Gulf states, signed a deal in October with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait for a $10 billion aid package tied to fiscal reforms that has averted the risk of a credit crunch.
Bahrain's finances have been hit by an oil price slump since 2014. The new parliament is expected to pass austerity measures needed to secure the aid package.

Joel Millman, spokesman for the International Organization for Migration (IOM), said that meant there were more migrants on the route than the 107,000 who have arrived in Europe this year after making the perilous trip from North Africa across the Mediterranean. 
""This is an emergency, an event that is at least as big, and probably bigger, than some of the other large movements going on in the world today. I guess the exception would be Venezuela,"" he told reporters, referring to the exodus of about 3 million people from crisis-hit Venezuela in recent years. 
""Migrants reaching Yemen travel first by land, primarily through Djibouti, and eventually undergo perilous boat journeys across the Gulf of Aden to Yemen, now one of the busiest maritime migration routes in the world,"" Millman said.
An estimated 92 percent of the migrants were Ethiopian and the rest were Somali, and one in five were minors, many of them unaccompanied.
Since the beginning of 2014, IOM has recorded more than 700 deaths in the Gulf of Aden, with 156 drownings this year, but Millman said that was certainly an underestimate.
Many cases went unreported, and sometimes people traffickers forced migrants out of their boat as soon as they came within sight of land, and many drowned, he said.
""Only when those bodies are recovered on the beach do we even hear about it,"" he added.
Millman said the migrants were driven by drought and unemployment in the Horn of Africa and lured by the wages available in the Gulf.
In July this year a U.N. report said Saudi Arabia had been deporting 10,000 Ethiopians per month after an amnesty for voluntary return ended in November 2017.
People smugglers used Yemen's war to drum up business, claiming that the authorities were too preoccupied to monitor Yemen's borders properly. 
“Of course, once they get there, it is a very different situation,"" he said.
""There are minefields to cross, there is gunfire... there are car crashes, all kinds of dangerous spots along the border. We have seen considerable fatalities for the last three years.""

73,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2018 02:54PM ET</span>","EU should sanction Iran over missile tests, U.S. says","By Robin Emmott and John Irish
BRUSSELS/PARIS (Reuters) - The United States is pressing the European Union to consider economic sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missiles, a senior U.S. official said on Tuesday, warning of a wider regional conflict if Tehran's ambitions remain unchecked.
Iran's test of a ballistic missile this month alarmed the West and France called it a destabilizing act, but the EU is focused on protecting the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran that U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of in May.
""We would like to see the European Union pass sanctions that would designate the people and the organizations that are facilitating Iran's missile testing and missile proliferation,"" Brian Hook, Washington's special representative for Iran, told Reuters after meetings with European powers in Brussels.
Such punitive measures usually involve travel bans and asset freezes and seek to choke off funding to such arms programs.
Hook said Iran's tests violated U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231 that enshrined the nuclear accord and he called on Tehran to stop all its ballistic missile-related activities designed to carry nuclear weapons. 
""This is a grave and escalating threat and we need to restore deterrents against Iran's missile program. Otherwise I think we are aggregating, we are accumulating risk of a regional conflict if we don't,"" Hook said.
Resolution 2231 says Iran is ""called upon"" to refrain for up to eight years from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons. Iran maintains that the resolution does not require it to stop missile development, which it says has nothing to do with its nuclear program.
Britain, France and Germany in March proposed fresh EU sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missiles, according to a confidential document seen by Reuters, but were rebuffed by other EU nations including Italy, which are seeking to develop business ties with the Islamic Republic.
Hook said Tehran was making transfers of Iranian missiles and missile technology to Syria and allies of Tehran, such as Houthi forces in Yemen and Lebanon's Iranian-backed Shi'ite Hezbollah, a position that European powers privately agree on.
However, diplomacy with Iran is highly sensitive for the EU because Brussels considers the 2015 pact to stop Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon as the bloc's biggest foreign policy achievement in decades and does not want it to collapse.
Fresh EU sanctions on top of renewed U.S. measures could risk that, European diplomats say. 
Asked if the United States was aware of European sensibilities, Hook said: ""Those who negotiated the deal, to begin with, made it very clear that just because it was focused on the nuclear (deal) didn't limit them from addressing all the other threats that Iran presents to peace and security.""
FRUSTRATING TALKS
Britain, France, and Germany have been talking to Iranian officials about its ballistic missile program and regional activities at the bilateral level since Trump indicated he would withdraw from the Iran deal in 2017. 
But diplomats say that after more than a year of regular talks, Iran has stood firm and maintains that its ballistic missile program is defensive and not up for negotiation.
That has frustrated officials. France in particular has bemoaned Iranian ""frenzy"" in developing and propagating missiles and wants Tehran to open negotiations over its missiles, which Hook said were capable of carrying nuclear warheads.
Over the last month, Britain's foreign minister and senior delegations from France and Germany have traveled to Tehran to raise the issue. ""They don't want to talk ballistics,"" said one European diplomat. 
A second European diplomat said it would be difficult for London, Paris and Berlin to get EU sanctions agreed, but added that it could be put back on the table given Iran's stance. 
EU foreign ministers showed cautious support on Nov. 19 for possible new economic sanctions on Iran in a shift of policy after accusations of Iranian attack plots in France and Denmark, diplomats said.

""Don't rule out us looking at sanctions again because we aren't getting concrete results for now,"" the diplomat said.

74,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2018 02:44PM ET</span>",Pakistan assures U.S. envoy of support for Afghan peace talks,"By Asif Shahzad
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan assured visiting U.S. special representative Zalmay Khalilzad on Tuesday that it would back a negotiated settlement with the Taliban to end the long war in Afghanistan, after President Donald Trump personally asked for Islamabad's help.
Khalilzad, an Afghan-born veteran U.S. diplomat who served as George W. Bush's ambassador to Afghanistan, Iraq and the United Nations, was named by the Trump administration three months ago as a special envoy to negotiate peace in Afghanistan.
His visit to Pakistan came a day after Pakistani officials confirmed that Trump had written to Prime Minister Imran Khan seeking assistance in moving peace talks forward. Khan said Pakistan would do whatever possible to help Washington negotiate with the Taliban.
Khalilzad arrived on Tuesday in Islamabad and called on Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, a foreign office statement said. It said the envoy reiterated Trump's desire to seek Pakistan's cooperation for peace in Afghanistan. 
""The foreign minister assured the U.S. side of Pakistan's steadfast support for a negotiated settlement,"" it said. 
In his letter to Khan, Trump offered to renew the strained relationship, Pakistan's foreign ministry said on Monday. The overture to Khan came after an exchange of barbed tweets between him and Trump last month, and represents a sea change from Trump's frequently harsh rhetoric toward Pakistan.
It could also add to speculation in the region that the United States is seeking to withdraw from Afghanistan.
The United States, which had more than 100,000 troops in Afghanistan at its peak in former President Barack Obama's first term, withdrew most of them in 2014 but still keeps around 8,000 there aiding the Afghan security forces and hunting militants.
Trump wants to bring to a close the conflict between Afghan security forces and the Taliban, who were removed from power with the aid of American bombing after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, and have fought ever since to reestablish their version of strict Islamic law.
U.S. officials have long been pushing Pakistan to lean on Taliban leaders, who Washington says are based inside Pakistan, to bring them to the negotiating table. The United States and Afghanistan's government have long accused Pakistan of covertly sheltering Taliban leaders, which Islamabad vehemently denies.
Khalilzad said last month said he hoped to reach a settlement by April 2019 to end the war. But Afghan Taliban militants last month rejected the proposed target and said a three-day meeting in Qatar between their leaders and Khalilzad, to pave the way for peace talks, had ended with no agreement.
Islamabad has promised in the past to work to help bring the Afghan Taliban to the negotiation table, but this will be the first attempt for Khan's new government, in power since August.

Khan, who enjoys the support of Pakistan's powerful army, believes the Afghan Taliban have been motivated to fight by the foreign military presence in Afghanistan, and says a political settlement is the only solution.

Trump said in July he would be willing to meet Rouhani without preconditions to discuss how to improve ties after he pulled the United States out of the 2015 nuclear deal, saying, ""If they want to meet, we’ll meet"".

Senior Iranian officials and military commanders rejected Trump’s offer as worthless and ""a dream"", saying his words contradicted his action of reimposing sanctions on Tehran.

Farage, as UKIP leader, put pressure on former Prime Minister David Cameron to promise an EU referendum and then helped lead the successful campaign to leave the bloc.
But after stepping down as UKIP leader following the referendum, Farage has been critical of the party which he cast as disorganized and poorly led.
""I am leaving UKIP today,"" Farage said. ""There is a huge space for a Brexit party in British politics, but it wont be filled by UKIP.""
Farage criticized a decision by the current leader, Gerard Batten, to appoint far-right activist Tommy Robinson as an adviser.
Once ridiculed by Cameron as the leader of a bunch of “fruitcakes and loonies and closet racists,” Farage has repeatedly taunted EU leaders over what he calls the “Brexit revolution.""

He is a keen supporter of Donald Trump and was pictured with him beside a golden lift shortly after the 2016 presidential election.

KIEV (Reuters) - Russia has been ramping up its forces near the border with Ukraine since August and now poses the greatest military threat since 2014, the year Moscow annexed Crimea, the commander of Ukraine's armed forces told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.
General Viktor Muzhenko gestured to a series of satellite images which he said showed the presence of Russian T-62 M tanks stationed 18 km (11 miles) from the Ukrainian border.
They had more than doubled to 250 from 93 machines within the space of two weeks from mid September to Oct 1. 
For Muzhenko this is evidence of a concerted build-up of Russian forces in the run-up to Nov. 25, when Russia fired on and captured three Ukrainian vessels at the Kerch Strait, an action Kiev's leadership fears may be a precursor to a full-scale invasion.
Ukraine and Russia have traded accusations over the clash. The Kremlin's spokesman on Monday dismissed as ""absurd"" the notion that Russia wanted to forcibly take over Ukrainian ports.
Muzhenko said Russian troop levels were at ""the highest"" since 2014, when Moscow annexed Crimea and then deployed forces to eastern Ukraine. 
""In front of us is an aggressor who has no legal, moral or any other limits,"" he said. ""It is very difficult to predict when it will occur to him to begin active combat actions against Ukraine.""
""This (the Kerch Strait incident) was an act of aggression from regular forces, the border service (of the Russian Federation) in relation to the Ukrainian armed forces,"" Muzhenko said. 
The Russian defense ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Muzhenko said Ukraine had deployed more land and air forces to the region in response, and intensified military exercises across the country, but declined to go into specifics. 
He added that Ukraine expects to complete the building of a military base on the Azov Sea, which had been planned before the navy clash, by next year. 
Ukraine was also expecting help from allies, mostly the United States, for equipment including air and naval reconnaissance, boats and weapons for ground troops, he said. 
COLLAPSE OF RELATIONS
Relations between Ukraine and Russia collapsed following the 2014 Crimea annexation and Russia's support for separatist rebels in the eastern Donbass region. 
The Donbass conflict has killed more than 10,000 people despite a notional ceasefire. Russia strongly denies sending troops and heavy weapons to the area. 
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko introduced martial law last week for a period of 30 days in regions of the country thought most vulnerable to a Russian attack.
Asked whether the military would need an extension once the 30 days of martial law expired, he said an assessment would be made closer to the time. 
    ""The term of martial law depends on the Russian Federation,"" he said. 
""Based on how it will increase its capabilities, how it will react, how it will provoke and carry out such provocations - not like in the Kerch Strait but also on a larger scale - the legal regime that will be defined in Ukraine depends on it.""
From around August, Russia had ramped up its deployment of forces on the Ukrainian border, he said. Some units were transferred from Russia's far east to the Ukrainian border in September during Vostok-2018, Russia's biggest war games since the fall of the Soviet Union.
""We are seeing an increase in the intensity of operational and combat training measures, and all of them, as a rule, are offensive in nature,"" he said. 
He said there was a ""serious increase"" in the amount of troops and weapons in Crimea and Russia had also doubled its naval presence in the region in the past month. 

""The combination of all these signs confirms the aggressiveness of the intentions and the threats of a military nature against Ukraine, which are constantly increasing,"" he said.

Unless the constitution is changed, Bashir, in power since 1989, is not permitted to stand again when his present term ends, having won two elections since a 2005 constitutional amendment took effect imposing a two-term limit.
Parliament speaker Ibrahim Ahmed Omar said he had received a letter signed by a majority of lawmakers backing an amendment that would extend the limit.
""Today I received a memorandum from 33 parties representing 294 deputies to amend the constitution with regard to the number of times the president's candidacy is allowed,"" he told reporters. ""I will abide by the constitutional and legal steps and the regulations necessary to discuss these amendments in parliament for it to take any decision on them.""
Sudan's ruling National Congress Party announced earlier this year it was nominating Bashir for president in 2020. 
""We agreed to amend the articles after we collected 294 deputies' signatures,"" said party head Abdurrahman Mohamed Ali.
""The parties saw that President Omar al-Bashir is the protector of the people of Sudan in the coming period.""
Bashir, an Islamist and former army officer, came to power via a military coup. He won elections in 2010 and 2015 after the constitution was changed following a peace agreement with southern rebels, who later seceded forming South Sudan.
Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes after being indicted in 2008 over killings and persecution in Sudan's Darfur province between 2003 and 2008.
The National Congress Party and its allies have an overwhelming majority in parliament. Prominent opposition parties and armed movements boycotted the presidential and legislative elections held in 2015.
The proposed constitutional changes would also give the president the power to sack elected governors. Last month, parliament passed a law that will see governors elected directly instead of being appointed by the president, as previously.
Under the Sudanese parliament's regulations, a proposal to amend the constitution should be submitted by the president or via a memorandum submitted by at least one-third of the members of the 581-seat parliament.

Sudan has been facing an economic crisis since the south seceded in 2011, taking with it three-quarters of Sudan's oil output. Sudan's opposition says Bashir must go to improve the country's image abroad and attract crucial investment and aid.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon's pick for the next commander of U.S. Central Command said on Tuesday the high casualty rate of Afghan security forces would not be sustainable even with the stalemate in the fight against Taliban militants.
""Their losses have been very high. They are fighting hard, but their losses are not going to be sustainable unless we correct this problem,"" Lieutenant General Kenneth McKenzie said during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing.
The assessment comes as both Western-backed security forces and the Taliban have pushed to gain momentum as the United States has stepped up efforts to find a peaceful settlement to end the 17-year-long war in Afghanistan.
Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said last month that since 2015 more than 28,000 members of the Afghan security forces had been killed.
McKenzie said the United States would have to work with Afghan forces to improve how they recruit, train and carry out missions.
He added that Afghan forces were not capable of securing the mountainous South Asian country without help from the nearly 14,000 U.S. troops deployed there.
""If we left precipitously right now, I do not believe they would be able to successfully defend their country,"" McKenzie said.
He said he did not know how long it would take for Afghan forces to be self-sufficient and that Taliban fighters were estimated at 60,000.
U.S. President Donald Trump wants to end the conflict between Afghan security forces and the Taliban, who are fighting to drive out international forces and reestablish their version of strict Islamic law after their 2001 ouster.
McKenzie said he was unaware of any plans to significantly change the U.S. military footprint in Afghanistan.
Recent attacks underscore the pressure on Afghanistan's overstretched security forces, suffering from their highest-ever level of casualties, estimates from the NATO-led ""Resolute Support"" mission show.
The Kabul government no longer releases exact casualty figures, but officials say at least 500 men are being killed each month and hundreds more wounded, a tally many consider low.
In November dozens of elite commandos were among the casualties suffered by Afghan security forces as the Taliban claimed to have taken a district in Ghazni province.
U.S. commanders have said they expect the Taliban to step up military efforts to better their position while they maintain contacts with U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad aimed at opening peace negotiations.
PAKISTAN
Trump recently asked for Pakistan's help with faltering Afghan peace talks in a letter to new Prime Minister Imran Khan, making clear that Islamabad's assistance was ""fundamental"" to the health of the two countries' strained relationship.
McKenzie said Pakistan was needed for long-term stability in Afghanistan and could play a key role in facilitating talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government.
""At this time, however, Pakistan does not appear to be using the full extent of its influence to encourage the Taliban to come to the table,"" McKenzie said in written responses to questions from lawmakers.

""We continue to see the Taliban being utilized as a hedge against India rather than as part of a stable, reconciled Afghanistan,"" he added.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May's government was found in contempt of parliament on Tuesday for refusing to release its full legal advice on Brexit, underlining the depth of opposition among lawmakers to her deal on leaving the European Union.
The row threatened to overshadow the start of five days of debate in parliament on May's Brexit deal ahead of a crucial vote on Dec. 11, when lawmakers will be asked to approve it.
Opposition parties and the small Northern Irish party that props up May's minority government are furious that it only provided an outline of the legal basis for its Brexit deal after parliament voted to be given the full advice.
They put forward a motion, which was backed by 311-293 in a vote on Tuesday, that found ministers in contempt of parliament and ordered the immediate publication of the advice.
""Today's finding of contempt is a badge of shame for this government. It is of huge constitutional and political significance,"" Keir Starmer, the opposition Labour Party's Brexit spokesman, said after the vote. ""Never before has the House of Commons found ministers in contempt of parliament."" 
The sanctions ultimately available include suspending a lawmaker, most likely Attorney General Geoffrey Cox. It was not clear whether the opposition parties would now push for that.
Such punishment is usually reserved for backbench lawmakers guilty of individual wrongdoing. In reality, Tuesday's vote was about putting pressure on a weakened government.
Catherine Haddon, senior fellow at the Institute for Government, said the opposition wanted to use ""every opportunity they have to show the instability of the government"".
The small Northern Irish party, the Democratic Unionists, which props up May's minority government, joined opposition parties in voting against the government on the contempt issue.
So many lawmakers - from May's own Conservatives as well as from the opposition parties - have spoken out against the deal that the odds look stacked against her winning the Dec. 11 vote.
Haddon said the contempt motion was a ""show of force"" which could foreshadow both the final vote on the deal and the various amendments lawmakers are trying to attach to it.
Cox gave parliament an outline of his legal advice to the government on Monday.
Andrea Leadsom, Leader of the House of Commons, said on Tuesday that this had been a ""full and frank exposition"", and that releasing the full advice would set a dangerous precedent.
She said the government, which had sought to slow down the process by referring the issue to parliament's Committee of Privileges, had fulfilled the spirit of the order to publish.

The government said after the vote that it would now publish the full advice.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York judge on Monday rescheduled Cardi B's court hearing to Friday after she failed to appear in criminal court to face charges of assault in connection with a fight at a strip club but warned that she risked arrest if she did not show up again.
The 26-year-old performer, whose real name is Belcalis Almanzar, surrendered to police in October after being accused of involvement in the Aug. 15 incident at the Angels NYC strip club in the borough of Queens. 
Judge Scott Dunn told her lawyer ""to convey to her that it’s not acceptable that she’s not here today,"" after she failed to show up for her scheduled appearance.
""You should inform her that if she doesn't show up to the arraignment on December 7, that unless the circumstances change, then it's very likely the court will issue a bench warrant for her arrest,” Dunn said to her lawyer, Jeff Kern.
Cardi B, a two-time Grammy award nominee, has topped music charts in recent years with hits ""Bodak Yellow"" and ""Girls Like You,"" a collaboration with Maroon 5. 
On her verified Instagram profile under the ""Story"" section, Cardi B early Monday posted a video featuring her on aircraft and another showing a vibrant blue ocean. There was no indication where the photos were taken or when she may have been at the locations. 
Kern, who admitted that he rarely had direct communication with Cardi B but spoke with her through business managers, apologized to the judge and blamed her failure to appear in court on poor communication. 
""I can tell you my client knew of the date, but there was a previously standing commitment for today and tomorrow,"" he said, assuring the judge that his client was not a flight risk. 
Kern said Cardi B had asked for an adjournment before Monday but the court had denied it. She was initially due in court on Oct. 29, but the court allowed her to reschedule.
According to the New York Times, Cardi B accused one of two sisters who tend bar at the Angels NYC club of having an affair with her husband, Offset, who is part of the rap trio Migos. Citing police, the newspaper said Cardi B's bodyguards and members of her entourage attacked the sisters with bottles and chairs.
Cardi B's agents and Joe Tacopina, an attorney representing the two bartenders, did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment on Monday. 

She has also made headlines for an ongoing feud with rapper Nicki Minaj, with whom she had a physical altercation during an event at this year's New York Fashion Week. After a series of posts on Twitter and Instagram directed at each other, the two agreed on a cease-fire in October.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Salvini clashed with one of the country's most respected judges on Tuesday after sending a congratulatory tweet for the arrest of ""15 Nigerian mobsters"" before the operation was complete.
Salvini sent a tweet at about 9 a.m. (0800 GMT) lauding the police dragnet in the northern city of Turin. That prompted the city's chief prosecutor, Armando Spataro, to issue a statement admonishing the minister for speaking out of turn.
The news was given ""while the operation was (and still is) underway, risking to undermine it,"" said Spataro, who has traded barbs with Salvini before. ""One should hope that, in future, the interior minister will avoid similar communications.""
Spataro also said Salvini got the number of arrests wrong and that only some of the suspects were sought on mafia charges.
Salvini, who takes a tough stance on immigration, suggested in reply that it might be time for the 69-year-old Spataro to retire and wished him ""a serene future as a pensioner"".
""No one should be free to say that the interior minister put a police operation at risk because he congratulated them for a brilliant operation,"" Salvini said later in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) live video stream, adding that a phone call could have cleared up the issue.
Salvini has regularly highlighted crimes committed by foreigners since taking office in June.
A savvy use of social media, combined with a nationalist ""Italians first"" message, has made Salvini's right-wing League party, one of the two in the ruling coalition, the most popular in Italy.
Spataro is known for his investigations into international terrorism, and in 2003 he spearheaded a delicate investigation into the ""extraordinary rendition"" to Egypt of a Milan imam, Abu Omar, by U.S. and Italian secret services.

In July, Spataro criticized Salvini's move to close Italy's ports to migrant rescue ships, saying it broke international law. Salvini responded: ""Maybe the Turin prosecutor thinks all of Africa can be hosted by Italy?""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ordinary Americans, generals and former Cabinet members paid respects at the U.S. Capitol Rotunda on Tuesday to the late U.S. President George H.W. Bush, who died last week at the age of 94 after a life of service as a World War Two hero, head of the CIA and wartime president. 
Under the soaring Capitol dome, office workers and tourists walked silently past a flag-draped casket that bore Bush's body. 
They were joined by former Secretary of State Colin Powell, who led the U.S. military during the 1991 Gulf War, as well as U.S. generals from that campaign against Iraq and former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge. 
Bush, the 41st U.S. president, was remembered as a patrician figure who represents a bygone era of bipartisan civility in American politics.
National flags flew at half-staff on many foreign diplomatic buildings on Washington's ""Embassy Row,"" past which Bush's coffin will be transported on its way to the Washington National Cathedral for a memorial service on Wednesday.
President Donald Trump, a fellow Republican, planned to visit with the mourning family at Blair House, near the White House, on Tuesday.
""The elegance & precision of the last two days have been remarkable!"" Trump wrote in a tweet of the Bush memorial events.
Bush's service dog, a young Labrador retriever named ""Sully,"" also walked past the casket and sat near it briefly.
Bush, father of the 43rd president, George W. Bush, will be buried on Thursday in Texas. 
Mourners lined up to enter the Capitol beginning Monday evening for the public viewing. 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell opened a session of the Senate on Monday heralding the ""daring"" former naval aviator, former director of the Central Intelligence Agency and president who won the Gulf War against the forces of Iraq's President Saddam Hussein. ""Year after year, post after post, George Bush stayed the course,"" McConnell said.
Bush was elected president in 1988 after serving two terms as President Ronald Reagan's vice president.
During his four years in the White House, Bush ended the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, steered the United States through the end of the Cold War and condemned China's 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ).
But he was dogged by domestic problems, including a sluggish economy. When he ran for re-election in 1992, he was pilloried by Democrats and many Republicans for violating his famous 1988 campaign promise: ""Read my lips, no new taxes.""
Democrat Bill Clinton coasted to victory, ending Bush's presidency. 
A Connecticut Yankee from a wealthy family who moved to Texas to be an oilman, Bush has been eulogized as a president with a keen sense of civility and duty.
""His character speaks most, because of his character, how he handled so many important points in our history. The Iraq war, the falling of the Berlin Wall, he wasn’t (saying) that’s all about me,"" Theresa Murphy, 64, a retired New York high school history teacher, said on Monday. ""Can you imagine what it would look like if our president today did that?"" 
Bush is the 12th U.S. president to lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda. The first was Abraham Lincoln following his assassination in 1865.
Early in his political career, Bush served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1967-1971. He lost bids in 1964 and 1970 for a U.S. Senate seat from Texas.

The federal government and some financial exchanges will be closed on Wednesday for a day of mourning.

Traditional shadow theater was historically a staple of Damascus cafe life, as story tellers used dyed animal-skin puppets to entertain their audience with tall tales, satire, songs and verse.
Last week the U.N.'s cultural agency UNESCO added Syrian shadow puppetry to its list of intangible heritage in urgent need of saving, noting its long decline in the face of modern forms of entertainment and the displacement caused by war. 
""Until three or five days ago, it was an art that didn't provide bread. Now we are thinking of buying bread and eating bread... I hope for the better,"" said Shadi al-Hallaq, the last puppeteer. 
When he took it up in his late teens in 1993, traditional shadow puppetry was already all but forgotten and his family worried he could never make it his living. 
He revived the art from old stories and history books, and made the puppets himself. They are crafted from camel, cow or donkey hide and each character represents a particular social trait. 
At a recent performance, Hallaq used a translucent screen, painted to resemble an alleyway in the Old City of Damascus, to tell a story about unscrupulous traders using the traditional two main characters - naive Karakoz and the wise, wily Aywaz. 
These two puppets, controlled with sticks and pressed against the back of the screen with the light behind them, so that their shadows are projected upon it, are the only ones he has left. 
Early in the war, Hallaq lost his mobile theater set and 23 other hand-made characters in eastern Ghouta, just outside Damascus, as the conflict flared. 
He fled the fighting, crossing the border into Lebanon, where he worked for two years as a laborer. While there he sometimes performed for Syrian school children and it was during such a show that UNESCO officials first noticed him. 
Now back in Damascus, he will start teaching a group of prospective puppeteers in about six months to ensure the art survives, said Rasha Barhoum, a Syrian cultural official. 
""I can imagine how happy people will be to see this art survive and not disappear because it is part of our heritage and our culture,"" Hallaq said.

TRIPOLI (Reuters) - After a month strolling the gold market in Libya's capital, retired public servant Milud Farhat was unable to find any jewelry he could afford for his daughter's wedding.
The 60-year-old is typical of Libya's once well-to-do middle class, impoverished by high inflation and devaluation during years of conflict in what used to be one of the Arab world's wealthiest countries.
In contrast, armed groups whose commanders cruise Tripoli's pot-holed streets in luxury cars have become rich by forcing authorities to hire them and grant them cheap dollars they can change on the black market for a premium.
To tackle this ""war economy"", Tripoli's internationally recognized government in September effectively devalued the exchange rate to 3.9 dinars per dollar from 1.3.
That cut the black market rate from 6 to 5.2, which shoppers and traders said had slightly eased prices for food and other goods, many of which are imported. 
But for Farhat, who lives on a pension of 400 dinars per month, it made little difference. The wedding of his youngest daughter, his seventh child, is coming up, and jewelry for the bride is a must in Libya.
""I have been coming every day for a month hoping that (gold) prices go down,"" he said. ""Normal people are just suffering,"" he said. 
Gold prices have dipped a little to around 180 dinars ($46) an ounce since the devaluation, but are still triple their level in 2014 when the dinar started diving due to volatile oil revenues, Libya's lifeline.
""The gold market is still very, very weak. Seventy-five percent of people coming are just asking,"" said gold trader Abdelhamid al-Zawi, standing in front of his empty shop.
WHEELBARROWS
Economic policies are distorted by rivalry between the Tripoli government and a parallel administration in the east that set up its own central bank in the aftermath of the Nato-backed uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.
Overall oil revenue is up: the Tripoli-based National Oil Corporation expects income from crude and oil product sales to hit $23.7 billion in 2018, a 73 percent jump from last year.
But money in the banks can be scarce. Many keep cash at home as they do not trust banks or play the black market.
To undermine street dealers based just behind the Tripoli central bank headquarters and gold merchants doubling as currency traders, authorities slapped a 183 percent fee on commercial hard currency deals in September, moving the rate to 3.9.
They also stopped restricting credit letters for imports, which Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Maiteeg said would help end the liquidity crisis by early 2019.
For a small and well-connected elite, money is still flowing as they keep a grip on business and oil revenues. In Tripoli's upmarket neighborhoods, sleek stores sell international fashion brands and new restaurants and cafes are opening.
But elsewhere in the capital, building projects halted during the 2011 uprising litter the skyline and rubbish lies uncollected. Many are still queuing at banks hoping to access their salaries but are unable to withdraw significant amounts.
""Sometimes you get 150 dinars. What can you do with that?,"" said Mahdi Ali Makhfuth, another pensioner shopping for food with two sons.
Authorities have also allowed citizens to bring up to $10,000 from abroad with credit cards, which Maiteeg said was bringing down the black market rate.
But Makhfuth dismissed the measure as benefiting the rich. ""Do normal citizens have 40,000 dinars in their accounts? No,"" he said, referring to the amount needed to access that maximum dollar allowance.
After a series of raids on the black market since September, dealers who use black plastic bags to carry dollars and wheelbarrows for devalued dinars have simply shifted into the labyrinth of the old city.
And despite new central bank measures to prevent currency scams, Alaeldin Elmasallati, commissioner at Libya's audit bureau, said they would still be possible due to lack of enforcement capacity.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A top European Union official urged member states on Tuesday to back the United Nation's migration pact amid a growing tide of dropouts that highlight how Europe has turned colder on accepting foreigners. 
At least six EU states have already shunned the accord to regulate the treatment of migrants worldwide, a sign of how the bloc has turned increasingly restrictive on accepting refugees and migrants alike since a 2015 spike in arrivals.
""I make a last call on them to rethink and reconsider their position,"" the EU's Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos told a news conference. 
The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration was agreed in July by all U.N. member nations, except the United States. The voluntary pact is due to be formally adopted in Marrakesh on Dec. 10-11.
It was conceived after the biggest influx of people into Europe since World War Two, many fleeing conflicts and poverty in the Middle East and Africa. Sea arrivals have since dropped sharply but political aftershocks still reverberate in the EU. 
Some former communist east bloc states - the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia - have renounced the U.N. agreement.
The issue has led to a government crisis in Belgium where the liberal premier wants to sign but the right-wing N-VA party threatens to bring down the ruling coalition if he does.
Austria has said it will not sign up and opposition from Italy's prominent interior minister, the right-wing Matteo Salvini, has thrown Rome's support into doubt.
In the Netherlands, a recent opinion poll showed 41 percent of people against signing the pact versus 34 percent in favor. Outside of the EU, Australia has also quit.

SARAJEVO (Reuters) - The United States expects Macedonia to join NATO in mid-2020 by which time its name change deal with Greece should be fully implemented despite Russian efforts to undermine it, the top U.S. official for the Western Balkans said on Tuesday. 
Skopje's agreement to change the country name to Republic of North Macedonia, ending perceptions that it held territorial claims to the Greek province of Macedonia, lifted a big obstacle to Macedonia joining NATO and the European Union, a move the West believes would help stem Russian influence in the region.
""I don't think there is any reason not to believe that North Macedonia could become the 30th member of NATO as early as 18 months from now,"" Matthew Palmer, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, told Reuters in an interview in Bosnia's capital Sarajevo.
""That is an entirely realistic target date,"" he said, praising the breakthrough agreement in June between Greece and Macedonia as the ""most significant positive development"" in efforts by Western Balkans states to achieve EU and NATO ties. 
He noted that NATO had already invited Macedonia to join the alliance and the process could move quickly upon full implementation of the name change accord, which must still be ratified by the Macedonian and Greek parliaments. 
Still, Palmer voiced concern about the ""malign influence"" of Russia both in Macedonia and in other countries of the Western Balkans - Bosnia, Serbia, Montenegro, Albania and Kosovo. 
He accused Russia of trying to undermine governments and institutions in an effort to halt the region's progress towards EU and NATO integration. Moscow has denied such accusations, accusing the West in turn of meddling in the Western Balkans. 
""It's not up to Russia to decide what Macedonia may or may not do in terms of how they associate themselves with European and Euro-Atlantic institutions,"" Palmer said, referring to Russian criticism of the Macedonian government. 
""Efforts to undermine the expressed will of the Macedonian public are destabilizing and damaging to the regional peace and security,"" he added.
Palmer said the United States supported dialogue between Serbia and its former province of Kosovo, which obtained independence after a 1998-99 war, and wanted them to return to negotiations.
""Agreement between Belgrade and Pristina would be a great step forward after (Macedonia's name change deal),"" he said, adding that Washington opposed the 100 percent tariffs imposed last month by Kosovo on Serbian and Bosnian goods.
Kosovo has said it will retain the tariffs until Belgrade recognizes it as an independent state.

The MPs were mostly from the grouping led by populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and allies on the list of former premier Haider al-Abadi, one lawmaker said, showing Reuters a video of the session taken on his mobile phone.
Abdul Mahdi and the ministers he was seeking to appoint left parliament shortly after and the vote was postponed.
The incident vividly showed the depth of disagreement over who should fill the remaining eight posts in government, including the hotly contested interior and defense ministries.
A rivalry between Sadr and Iran-backed militia leader Hadi al-Amiri, who lead the two biggest blocs in parliament after a general election in May, has prevented the formation of a full government, which currently has 14 out of 22 ministers.
Sadr says candidates not affiliated with political sides must be presented. Amiri wants his ally Falih al-Fayyadh, former head of an Iran-backed paramilitary force, for the position of interior minister.
Abdel Mahdi said in a statement on Monday he would present Fayyadh as his candidate for the interior for parliament to vote on.
Sadr and Abadi's blocs refused to attend the session in response but stormed in halfway through, charging that the session did not have a quorum to take place.
The deadlock over forming a cabinet has raised the prospect of further unrest as the country struggles to rebuild and recover after three years of war with Islamic State.
Sadr has threatened to withdraw support for the government if it is not formed soon and whip up popular protests.
Lack of jobs and services led to mass protests in the southern city of Basra in September.
On Tuesday police dispersed dozens of protesters in Basra in a similar but small demonstration, witnesses said.

Brazil's Prosecutor General Raquel Dodge asked the top court to allow an investigation into whether Onyx Lorenzoni, who will serve as Bolsonaro's chief of staff and longtime federal congressman, took illegal campaign donations from the world's largest meatpacker JBS SA. 
Executives of JBS said they made 200,000 reais ($52,290) worth of such payments to Onyx between 2012 and 2014. They made the accusation in plea-bargain testimony, part of a deal with prosecutors that saw J&F Investimentos SA, the holding that controls JBS, pay a record 10.3 billions reais fine for bribing over 1,800 politicians at all levels in Brazil in recent years. 
A spokesman for Onyx did not respond to requests for comment.
Sweetheart contracts with governments and state loans helped fuel growth at J&F over the past decade, enabling it to assert control of JBS while expanding into fashion, dairy production, pulp processing and banking. 
JBS grew from a mid-sized slaughterhouse in Brazil's Midwest into one of the world's top-three food processing companies in over a decade through acquisitions partially funded by government-supplied money.
The investigation is the second graft allegation made against a top member of Bolsonaro's incoming government, a thorny issues as the leader was elected on a law-and-order platform a vow to end widespread political corruption exposed by the sprawling ""Car Wash"" investigation and other probes.

Last week, federal police opened an investigation into Paulo Guedes, who Bolsonaro has named as his economy minister, and whether he committed fraud tied to pension funds of state-run firms. Guedes' lawyers said he had done nothing wrong.

Ikaika Erik Kang, 35, agreed to a plea deal in August on four counts of breaking anti-terrorism laws in which he accepted a proposed sentence of 25 years in prison.
Kang had begun expressing support for Islamic State, designated by the United States as a foreign terrorist organization, by early 2016, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. 
Undercover agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation began meeting with Kang earlier this year, some of them posing as members of the militant group.
Kang gave them military gear and classified documents and agreed to teach them hand-to-hand combat in a video-recorded session he thought would be used to train other Islamic State fighters, according to federal prosecutors.
Lawyers for Kang filed three letters of support in court on Monday that described him as a diligent but withdrawn soldier who struggled with his mental health.
Kang's older sister, Erika Takahashi, wrote that Kang grew up in a ""very abusive household.""
""I do not know when things got like this for my brother but I know he is a good person on the inside,"" she wrote.
Two soldiers who worked with Kang in air-traffic control at Alabama's Fort Rucker military post wrote to Judge Susan Oki Mollway, urging her to help Kang get counseling.
Thomas Maia, who was Kang's first supervisor at Fort Rucker, called Kang a ""model soldier"" but said he had worried about Kang's odd behavior. This included staring at a wall for hours on end, saying he was trying to listen to the sound of his blood running through his veins, Maia wrote.
Maia wrote that his efforts to secure a mental health evaluation for Kang were rebuffed.
""He didn't seek out ISIS on his own, he was approached and socially engineered by the FBI at the Army's request,"" Maia wrote, using an acronym to refer to the Islamic State. ""If he would have been given adequate mental treatment back when I asked for it, none of this would have happened.""

Federal prosecutors say Kang agreed to swear an oath of loyalty to Islamic State in a pseudo-ceremony organized by the undercover FBI agents. After the ceremony, Kang told the agents he was ready to take his rifle to downtown Honolulu and start shooting, whereupon he was arrested.

Land is a hot-button issue in South Africa where racial inequality remains entrenched more than two decades after the end of apartheid when millions among the black majority were dispossessed of their land by a white minority.
A parliamentary team last month recommended a constitutional amendment to make it possible for the state to expropriate land without compensation in the public interest.
The team's report was debated in parliament on Tuesday and approved by a majority of the members present. 
However, adopting the report is just one step in a long process to change the constitution to allow for land reforms.
President Cyril Ramaphosa, who replaced Jacob Zuma in February, has prioritized land redistribution as he seeks to unite the fractured ruling African National Congress (ANC) and win public support ahead of an election next year.
But the main opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) and some rights groups are critical of the government's plans, saying it will jeopardize property rights and scare off investors.
""We support expropriation of land without compensation or zero Rand compensation in the public interest,"" the ANC's Vincent Smith said during the parliamentary debate. 
Ahead of Tuesday's debate, John Steenhuisen, the main opposition's chief whip, said ""the DA will not hesitate to approach the courts"" should the report backing the expropriation of land be adopted.
Following Tuesday's vote, a new bill proposing the change to Section 25 of the constitution to allow for expropriation of land without compensation would need to be drafted. 
It would also require the public's contribution before a debate and vote in the assembly. To become law, it would need passed by both houses of parliament and then signed by Ramaphosa. It is unclear how long this process would take.

Last week the High Court rejected a legal challenge brought by AfriForum, a group representing mainly white Afrikaners who wanted to overturn a parliamentary committee report supporting changes to the constitution.

95,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2018 10:07AM ET</span>",Macron makes U-turn on fuel-tax increases in face of 'yellow vest' protests,"By Simon Carraud and Michel Rose
PARIS (Reuters) - France's prime minister on Tuesday suspended planned increases to fuel taxes for at least six months in response to weeks of sometimes violent protests, the first major U-turn by President Emmanuel Macron's administration after 18 months in office.
In announcing the decision, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said anyone would have ""to be deaf or blind"" not to see or hear the roiling anger on the streets over a policy that Macron has defended as critical to combating climate change.
""The French who have donned yellow vests want taxes to drop, and work to pay. That's also what we want. If I didn't manage to explain it, if the ruling majority didn't manage to convince the French, then something must change,"" said Philippe.
""No tax is worth jeopardizing the unity of the nation.""
Along with the delay to the tax increases that were set for January, Philippe said the time would be used to discuss other measures to help the working poor and squeezed middle-class who rely on vehicles to get to work and go shopping. 
Earlier officials had hinted at a possible increase to the minimum wage, but Philippe made no such commitment. 
He warned citizens, however, that they could not expect better public services and lower taxes.
""If the events of recent days have shown us one thing, it's that the French want neither an increase in taxes or new taxes. If the tax-take falls then spending must fall, because we don't want to pass our debts on to our children. And those debts are already sizeable,"" he said.
The so-called ""yellow vest"" movement, which started on Nov. 17 as a social-media protest group named for the high-visibility jackets all motorists in France carry in their cars, began with the aim of highlighting the squeeze on household spending brought about by Macron's taxes on fuel.
However, over the past three weeks the movement has evolved into a wider, broadbrush anti-Macron uprising, with many criticizing the president for pursuing policies they say favor the rich and do nothing to help the poor. 
Despite having no leader and sometimes unclear goals, the movement has drawn people of all ages and backgrounds and tapped into a growing malaise over the direction Macron is trying to take the country in. Over the past two days, ambulance drivers and students have joined in and launched their own protests.
After three weeks of rising frustration, there was scant indication Philippe's measures would placate the ""yellow vests"", who themselves are struggling to find a unified position. 
""The French don't want crumbs, they want a baguette,"" 'yellow vest' spokesman Benjamin Cauchy told BFM, adding that the movement wanted a cancellation of the taxes.
Another one, Christophe Chalencon, was blunter: ""We're being taken for idiots,"" he told Reuters, using a stronger expletive.
GREEN GOALS
The timing of the tax U-turn is uncomfortable for Macron. It comes as governments meet in Poland to try to agree measures to avert the most damaging consequences of global warming, an issue Macron has made a central part of his agenda. His carbon taxes were designed to address the issue. 
But the scale of the protests against his policies made it almost impossible to plow ahead as he had hoped. 
While the ""yellow vest"" movement was mostly peaceful to begin with, the past two weekends have seen outpourings of violence and rioting in Paris, with extreme far-right and far-left factions joining the demos and spurring chaos. 
On Saturday, the Arc de Triomphe national monument was defaced and avenues off the Champs Elysees were damaged. Cars, buildings and some cafes were torched.
The unrest is estimated to have cost the economy millions, with large-scale disruption to retailers, wholesalers, the restaurant and hotel trades. In some areas, manufacturing has been hit in the run up to Christmas.
CHANGE FRANCE?
Macron, a 40-year-old former investment banker and economy minister, came to office in mid-2017 promising to overhaul the French economy, revitalize growth and draw foreign investment by making the nation a more attractive place to do business. 
In the process he earned the tag ""president of the rich"" for seeming to do more to court big business and ease the tax burden on the wealthy. Discontent has steadily risen among blue-collar workers and others who feel he represents an urban ""elite"".
For Macron, who is sharply down in the polls and struggling to regain the initiative, a further risk is how opposition parties leverage the anger and the decision to shift course.
Ahead of European Parliament elections next May, support for the far-right under Marine Le Pen and the far-left of Jean-Luc Melenchon has been rising. Macron has cast those elections as a battle between his ""progressive"" ideas and what he sees as their promotion of nationalist or anti-EU agendas.

Le Pen was quick to point out that the six-month postponement of the fuel-tax increases took the decision beyond the European elections.

Only 10 migrants from the capsized boat survived, all of whom were suffering from severe dehydration, Othman Belbeisi, head of the U.N. migration agency IOM in Libya, said on Twitter.
The owner of a beach chalet found the migrants washing up on the shore near the city of Misrata and called authorities, who brought them to the Red Crescent relief service and hospitals, residents said.
""We were 25 migrants on a boat ... We set off from (the western Libyan town of) Sabratah and we were at sea for 12 days without food and water,"" the survivor said. ""Fifteen have died.""
The survivors had been brought to a detention center and doctors and emergency teams are on the way, Belbeisi said.
No more details from authorities were immediately available. 
Libya’s western coast is a departure point for mainly sub-Saharan African migrants fleeing wars and poverty and hoping to build new lives in Europe.

But the number of migrants reaching Italy has fallen sharply since last year as smuggling networks inside Libya have been disrupted and the European Union has stepped up efforts to increase Libyan coastguard patrols.

Lofven is trying to form a cabinet following an inconclusive election in September. He is now serving in a caretaker capacity after losing a mandatory vote of confidence that followed the election, but is trying to win support from traditional rivals the Centre Party and the Liberals to avert another election.
Centre Party leader Annie Loof said the Social Democrats had not yet satisfied her party's demands for reforms, which include lower taxes and less restrictive labor and housing laws.
""The Social Democrats' response to the Centre Party's political demands are unfortunately far from enough,"" she wrote in the daily Aftonbladet. ""Taking that into consideration, we are ready to vote no ... but we will give the Social Democrats one final chance."" 
Last week Loof ruled out joining a Social Democrat-led government but said her party could abstain in the vote over Lofven's premiership if its demands were met. 
Lofven's Social Democrats have just 100 seats in the 349-member Riksdag, with the remaining seats divided among seven parties, making forming a coalition difficult.
The Centre Party controls 31 seats, which could be enough to sink Lofven if it votes against him.

U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of an international nuclear agreement in May and reimposed sanctions on the Islamic Republic, criticizing the deal for not including curbs on Iran's development of ballistic missiles. 
""One of our most important programs is increasing the range of missiles and ammunition,"" said the head of the Iranian air force, Brigadier General Aziz Nasirzadeh, according to the semi-official Fars news agency. 
""We don't see any limitations for ourselves in this field.""
Iran's military has cited 2,000 km (1,240 miles) as the current missile range, and said U.S. bases in Afghanistan, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, plus U.S. aircraft carriers in the Gulf, were within range. 
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also defended the missile program in a Twitter post on Tuesday, in which he said the U.N. Security Council resolution which endorsed the nuclear agreement did not ban Tehran from working on missiles.
""Making a mockery of the UNSC won't obscure failure to fulfill obligations & to hold US to account over non-compliance. Esp when even US admits that UNSCR2231 does NOT prohibit Iran's deterrent capabilities. Rather than undermining 2231, better to work towards its adherence by all."" Zarif wrote.
Nasirzadeh did not give details on how far Iran would like to increase that range, according to the Fars report.
Tehran insists its missile program is purely defensive but has threatened to disrupt oil shipments through the Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf if Washington tries to strangle its exports. 
At the weekend, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo condemned what he described as Iran's testing of a medium-range ballistic missile capable of carrying multiple warheads as a violation of the agreement on Tehran's nuclear program.

Iran has repeatedly said its missile program is not up for negotiation.

LJUBLJANA (Reuters) - The new online game ""Razor Wire"" has three fiendishly tricky levels to it: First, escape war in your home country. Then, dodge police as they raze your migrant camp, and lastly, cross a river while avoiding the corpses of those who never made it.
You only get one life. 
But winning is not the objective of Razor Wire, nor is its rudimentary, top-down design complete with chunky pixels intended to please lovers of retro computer games.
Instead, Razor Wire is the project of a Slovenian human rights group which hopes to raise awareness of the hardship and despair migrants face and help its campaign for the government to dismantle a wire fence on the Slovenian-Croatian border. 
""The wire fence has been standing on the Slovenian border for three years and it seems like we stopped caring, it seems like we have accepted it as a given reality,"" said Maja Cimerman, a project manager at the NGO ""Today is a New Day"".
""It has not made crossings impossible ... but more dangerous,"" Cimerman said. 
Nine migrants drowned while trying to cross the Kolpa river last year, she added, a figure confirmed by a police spokeswoman. Those killed may not have known how to swim or were surprised by deep water or strong currents, the spokeswoman said.
Sections of the fence first went up in 2015, when hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and other regions passed through the Balkans and Slovenia on their way to wealthier Western European states.
The Balkan route was sealed off in 2016 and the number of illegal crossings into Slovenia has decreased sharply, to about 8,000 in the first ten months of this year, compared to almost 500,000 in the period from October 2015 to March 2016.
But the fence is still standing and now covers about 179 km (111 miles) of the 670-km-long border with Croatia. 
Although not as strong as in neighboring Hungary for instance, anti-immigration sentiment has been on the rise in Slovenia since the 2015 migrant crisis. In June, the anti-immigrant SDS party scored a landslide victory in a parliamentary election but was forced into the opposition after failing to form a coalition government.
Inspiration for the game came from the migrants themselves, Cimerman said.
""Many refugees... call their experience ""the game"" because it has many traps and obstacles. They have to travel at night, they have to avoid the police, they are often robbed or their documents are taken away by the police, and often or regularly they are sent back to refugee camps,"" she said.
There is no happy ending to Razor Wire: when the player manages to cross the Kolpa river and finally reaches the Slovenian border, he is greeted by a sign depicting razor wire and cannot go any further.
""Many of them have tried ""the game"" 10 times or more and they continue trying till they enter Europe,"" she said. 
Cimerman said refugees were a useful scapegoat for the government.

""It's easier for the government to deal with migrants and to create a sense that refugees are a threat to us than actually dealing with real problems,"" she said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Police in India are investigating whether a deadly protest over the alleged slaughter of a cow, an animal many Hindus consider sacred, was aimed at sparking religious tension during a Muslim gathering.
Monday's violence in the country's most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, which killed two people, brings back to the national spotlight a trend of cow vigilantism by hardline Hindu groups ahead of a general election due in less than six months.
Police have arrested four of 27 men named in a complaint after a police officer and a man were killed in the northern state's district of Bulandshahr as tens of thousands of Muslims gathered for a religious event.
Police would try to determine the age of the cow carcass, police official Anand Kumar said when asked if there had been a conspiracy to vitiate the atmosphere by using a dead cow brought in from elsewhere.
""If there was anything like that, then the details will come out,"" Kumar, the state's second highest police official, told a news conference. ""There's an intelligence investigation and all these aspects will be looked into.""
The Muslim religious event ended peacefully and the situation had returned to normal, Kumar added.
Police have yet to arrest the main suspect, who belongs to the hardline Hindu group Bajrang Dal, said Bholendra, a leader of the group, who goes by one name.
Only an investigation would reveal if members of the group were guilty, he added. ""Every action has a reaction,"" he said, however, while adding that the group did not believe in unprovoked violence.
Last year, a Reuters investigation https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/india-politics-religion-cows showed that cow vigilantism flourished during the first three years of the term of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, run by his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
Bhola Singh, the BJP lawmaker from the district, told reporters the protests escalated because people were agitated over two recent incidents of cow slaughter.
The dead police officer, Subodh Kumar Singh, had helped lead an investigation into the 2015 murder by a Hindu mob of a Muslim man rumored to have slaughtered a cow in a village that is about an hour's travel away by road from the district.
The family of the man, a blacksmith, denied the accusation that they secretly ate beef, which is banned in many Indian states including Uttar Pradesh, which is ruled by a Hindu priest from the BJP.
Police officer Kumar declined to say why Singh was transferred from the area and the murder case handed to another officer.

Regeni, a 28-year-old postgraduate student at Cambridge University, vanished in Cairo in January 2016. His body was found almost a week later and a post mortem showed he had been tortured before his death.
There was no immediate comment from authorities in Egypt. Egyptian officials have repeatedly denied any involvement in Regeni's killing.
The five suspects are all members of the National Security Agency and include a general, two colonels and a major, the source said. They are under investigation for allegedly kidnapping Regeni. No one has yet been named in connection with the killing itself.
Being placed under official investigation in Italy does not imply guilt and does not automatically lead to a trial.
Regeni disappeared on Jan. 25, 2016 - the fifth anniversary of the start of the 2011 uprising that ended the 30-year rule of Hosni Mubarak.
Intelligence and security sources told Reuters in 2016 that police had arrested Regeni outside a Cairo metro station and then transferred him to a compound run by Homeland Security.

Italian and Egyptian investigators have been working together to try to solve the crime and have held regular meetings in Rome and Cairo to pool their information. However judicial sources in Rome told Reuters last week that Italy was frustrated by the slow pace of developments in Egypt.

YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar’s Minister for Religion on Tuesday said Rohingya Muslim refugees living in neighboring Bangladesh are being ""brainwashed"" into ""marching"" on the Buddhist-majority nation, amid a diplomatic feud over the fate of the persecuted minority.
More than 730,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar’s Rakhine state in the wake of a brutal army crackdown last August, U.N. agencies say, and are now living in crowded Bangladeshi refugee camps. U.N. investigators have accused Myanmar soldiers of carrying out mass killings, rapes and burning hundreds of villages with ""genocidal intent"". Myanmar denies most of the allegations.
Thura Aung Ko said Bangladesh was ""not letting them return"", referring to the Rohingya as ""Bengalis"", a term commonly used in Myanmar to imply that they are recent interlopers from Bangladesh. Rohingya say they are native to Rakhine state.
""If [they] release them, the population will drop,"" he said in a video shared by NewsWatch, a news website. ""And then, they, at the camps, also feed and brainwash Bengali youths to truly march. They will march on Myanmar. The future goal of those over populated Bengalis is to march on Myanmar.""
Plans to repatriate an initial group of 2,260 Rohingya from the camps last month were scuppered after none of the refugees agreed to go back, saying they wanted guarantees of safety and citizenship.
Thura Aung Ko, a former general who was appointed to the cabinet by Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi after she came to power in 2016, was expanding on comments he made at the funeral of a prominent monk last week. On Nov. 27, he expounded on birth rates among members of an unnamed ""extreme religion"" and the threat it posed to Buddhism in Myanmar.
""While we Buddhists practise monogamy and have only one or two children, an extreme religion encourages to have three or four wives and give birth to 15 to 20 children,"" he said in a video published by Radio Free Asia. ""After three, four, five decades in this Buddhist country, the Buddhist community will certainly become the minority."" 
On Tuesday, he clarified: ""In fact, ‘other religion’ means Bengalis.""
San Aung, the chairman of an Islamic society based in Yangon, told Reuters by phone the comments were ""very sad"". 
""As a minister for religion he shouldn’t speak irresponsibly,"" he said.

North Korea's Ri Yong Ho thanked Walid al-Moualem for Syria's opposition to economic sanctions on Pyongyang, according to Syria's foreign ministry. Moualem said Syria was grateful for North Korea's support in international forums.
United Nations monitors say the relationship has gone deeper than diplomacy and accused North Korea in February of cooperating with Syria on chemical weapons - a charge North Korea denied. 
Israel in 2007 bombed a suspected nuclear reactor in eastern Syria which it said was being constructed with help from North Korea and had been months away from activation. 
Syria, a signatory of the 1970 nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, has always denied that the site was a reactor or that Damascus engaged in nuclear cooperation with North Korea.
Both countries have faced international isolation, North Korea over its nuclear weapons program, and Syria over its nearly eight-year-old civil war.

KUALA LUMPUR/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Malaysia has told Singapore it intends to take back control of airspace that the city-state has managed since 1974 amid a dispute over a flight path to a secondary airport in Singapore, Malaysia's transport minister said on Tuesday.
Singapore has put in place a new instrument landing system at its small Seletar airport to be used by turboprops and business jets that involves a flight path over Malaysian airspace without its permission, Malaysian Transport Minister Anthony Loke told parliament.
He said the flight path would lead to height limits on building development and affect shipping operations in the state of Johor on the south of the Malaysian peninsula that borders the relatively tiny island of Singapore.
Malaysia refused to approve the flight path on Nov. 28 and 29, Loke said, and on Nov. 29 informed Singapore it planned to take back airspace over Johor, that it had delegated for management by the city-state since 1974, in phases, with the first expected around the end of 2019 and the next phase in 2023.
""We feel that it is now the time that we regained the control of our very own airspace because over the years, we have also upgraded our air traffic control and we think we are capable of doing so,"" he said. ""So we want to begin the process of negotiations with our Singapore counterpart.""
Loke did not provide details of what airspace Malaysia intended to regain in each phase. 
The Singapore transport ministry said in a statement in response to Loke's comments that Singapore ""respects Malaysia's sovereignty"".
“Airspace in this region is one of the most complex in the world… The benefits to both our economies and our people have been tremendous…. Hence, any proposed changes will impact many stakeholders,” it added. 
Singapore's far larger and newer Changi Airport, one of the biggest hubs in Asia, uses a portion of that airspace for departures and approaches and would not want to be reliant on Malaysian management of it, said an industry source who expected they would settle the dispute before it got to that stage.
Singapore was once part of Malaysia but they separated acrimoniously in 1965, clouding diplomatic and economic dealings for years. Ties were particularly frosty during Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's previous tenure as prime minister, between 1981 and 2003. 
Since returning to office after an election this year, Mahathir has deferred a rail project with Singapore and has said he wants to renegotiate the terms of a water-sharing agreement struck in 1962.
Just hours after Loke's comments, Singapore hit back with its own territorial protest against Malaysia over Kuala Lumpur's plan to extend the limits of a port in its southern-most state.
“We note with grave concern that Malaysia has recently purported to extend the Johor Bahru port limits in a manner which encroaches into Singapore Territorial Waters,” it said in a separate statement. 
""In response, Singapore has lodged strong protest with the Malaysian Government,” the transport ministry added.
A Malaysian foreign ministry spokesman declined to comment on Singapore's protest, and directed queries to the transport ministry. A spokesman for Loke declined comment.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's expulsion of 18 international aid agencies will hurt 11 million aid recipients in a South Asian nation grappling with perilously low standards of education and healthcare, two Western diplomats said on Tuesday. 
Affected NGOs include World Vision, Pathfinder, Plan International, Trocaire and Saferworld, while another group, ActionAid, last week said it was closing offices and laying off staff after the government told it to halt operations and leave.
Pakistan's interior ministry confirmed it had rejected the appeals of 18 NGOs that had been allowed to continue operations while their appeals were being reviewed, but declined to give further details. 
Aid groups and western diplomats have criticized a lack of transparency in the process of expulsion and the review of appeals by the aid agencies, saying they crimped humanitarian work. 
""It is as appalling as it is inexplicable that the government has decided to deprive 11 million of its own people of much-needed support with no apparent reason,"" a Western diplomat told Reuters, asking not to be identified.
The interior ministry did not immediately respond to the diplomats' comments, instead referring Reuters to a statement by Pakistan's foreign office last month.
In its Nov. 15 statement, the foreign office said policies regarding international aid groups were ""fully aligned"" with nationally determined development priorities and needs, and that Islamabad appreciated the assistance provided by donor agencies. 
""Representatives of all 18 INGOs were given the right to appeal and the opportunity to provide additional details and discuss mutual concerns,"" it added.
""As for shrinking space, the evidence is contrary to assertions. Out of 141 that applied for registration since October 2015, applications of 74 INGOs have been approved.""
A total of 27 international NGOs received expulsion orders late last year, but 18 appealed. Most of the affected groups worked on human rights and advocacy issues. 
This week's expulsion orders come amid complaints by Pakistani journalists about growing curbs on media freedom, though Islamabad has clamped down on foreign-funded aid groups for years.
""The international community is disappointed by the recent forced closures of a number of international NGOs,"" another Western diplomat told Reuters. 
""We have consistently expressed our concern to the government and continue to urge a clear and transparent process to ensure INGOs can operate effectively in Pakistan or understand the reasons for their eviction.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations said on Tuesday it was seeking $738 million in 2019 to help neighbouring countries cope with the inflow of millions of Venezuelan refugees and migrants, who have ""no prospect for return in the short to medium term"".
It was the first time that the crisis was included in the U.N. annual global humanitarian appeal which is $21.9 billion for 2019 without Syria.
Three million Venezuelans have fled the political and economic crisis in the Andean country, most since 2015, according to the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR.
""There is one crisis for which we for the first time have a response plan, which is to help the countries neighbouring Venezuela deal with the consequences of large numbers of Venezuelans leaving the country,"" U.N. emergency relief coordinator Mark Lowcock told a Geneva news briefing.
The majority of Venezuelans have fled to 16 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, led by Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.
""In 2019, an estimated 3.6 million people will be in need of assistance and protection, with no prospects for return in the short to medium term,"" the U.N. appeal said.
Colombia, which has taken in one million Venezuelans, is ""bearing the biggest burden of all"", Lowcock said.
President Nicolas Maduro blames the country's economic problems on U.S. financial sanctions and an ""economic war"" led by political adversaries. Maduro is to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Wednesday.
The exodus, driven by violence, hyperinflation and major shortages of food and medicine, led to a small U.N. emergency appeal of $9 million announced last week for health and nutrition projects inside Venezuela.
Lowcock, asked about Venezuelan government acceptance of aid inside the country, said:
""I think there is a shared agreement that more U.N. help in those sorts of areas would be a very helpful thing in reducing the suffering of people inside Venezuela.
""What we have agreed with the government of Venezuela is that we should strengthen our collaborative work and support for example in area of health services and nutrition,"" he said.

The protest is the latest development in a series of spats between the neighboring countries over parts of the Singapore Strait, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.
Singapore's Transport Ministry said on Tuesday it has asked Malaysia to reverse the steps it had taken on the port limits ""to reflect the sovereignty of Singapore over the waters in question, and that Malaysia refrain from taking any further unilateral action"".
""We note with grave concern that Malaysia has recently purported to extend the Johor Bahru port limits in a manner which encroaches into Singapore Territorial Waters (“STW”) off Tuas,"" the ministry said in a statement. 
""In response, Singapore has lodged strong protest with the Malaysian Government,"" it said.
Malaysia's transport ministry declined to comment.
The Singapore ministry said Malaysian vessels had also repeatedly intruded into Singapore's territorial waters over the past two weeks off Tuas, in the city-state's west. 
""Singapore has protested the unauthorized movements of and purported assertions of sovereignty by these vessels, which are inconsistent with international law,"" it said. 
Singapore will not hesitate to take firm action against intrusions and unauthorized activities in our waters, it said, adding it was ready to engage with Malaysia to resolve the matters amicably, in accordance with international law. 
The two countries had previously engaged in a territorial dispute over remote rocky outcrops off Malaysia's southeastern shores that led to the International Court of Justice awarding rights to a formation to each party in 2008. 
Singapore was once part of Malaysia but they separated acrimoniously in 1965, clouding diplomatic and economic dealings for years.

PALERMO, Italy (Reuters) - Italian police have arrested the suspected new head of the Sicilian mafia and 45 other alleged mobsters in a major blow to organized crime on the Mediterranean island, the government said on Tuesday.
""There is no more room for this type of scum in Italy,"" Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio wrote on Instagram.
The previous boss of bosses, Salvatore ""Toto"" Riina, died in prison last year after spending almost a quarter of a century behind bars for ordering dozens of murders, including those of two of Italy's most celebrated anti-mob prosecutors.
Among those arrested on Tuesday was Settimo Mineo, an 80-year-old jeweler suspected of heading local mafia families in the Sicilian capital Palermo and of being promoted to lead the whole crime group in May, police said.
""The arrests ... represent one of the biggest blows inflicted on the mafia by the state. Mineo had been elected 'heir' of Toto Riina after his death,"" Di Maio added.
A police source said Mineo was elected boss at a meeting of provincial leaders of the Sicilian mafia, known as 'Cosa Nostra' (Our Thing), on May 29. It was believed to be the first such gathering of mob families for more than 25 years.
Once all-powerful on Sicily, the world's most famous crime gang has been squeezed over the past two decades, with many bosses put behind bars, businesses sequestered and locals increasingly ready to defy it.
The meeting in May of the Cosa Nostra cupola, or hierarchy, was seen by investigators as a sign the group was looking to rebuild.
""With an extraordinary operation in the Palermo province, the police have dismantled Cosa Nostra's new 'cupola',"" Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said on Twitter.
Mineo was sentenced to five years in jail for mafia-related crimes at the so-called ""maxi-trial"" that ran from 1986-1992 and was spearheaded by prosecutors Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino.
Both Falcone and Borsellino were murdered in 1992 on Riina's orders after verdicts were delivered. Following their deaths, the state poured resources into the fight against the mob and ground down Cosa Nostra.
One prominent mafioso the police have been unable to capture is Matteo Messina Denaro, nicknamed ""Diabolik"", who has been on the run since 1993 and comes from the province of Trapani in western Sicily. It was not clear if he attended the May meeting.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Lawyers representing South Korean plaintiffs in a World War Two forced labor court case against Japan's Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp. have set a Dec. 24 deadline for the firm to show willingness to discuss a court verdict on compensation.
If Nippon Steel fails to respond, the lawyers, who spoke after being denied a meeting with company officials for a second time on Tuesday, said they would start procedures to seize its South Korean assets.
Tuesday's incident stemmed from a ruling by South Korea's Supreme Court late in October that Nippon Steel must pay 100 million won ($90,500) to each of four South Koreans for forced labor during the war.
The Japanese government has denounced the verdict, saying all wartime reparations were dealt with in a 1965 treaty that normalized ties between the two nations.
At the time of the ruling, Nippon Steel called it ""extremely regrettable"", but added that it would review the decision carefully in considering further steps.
On Tuesday, the lawyers visited Nippon Steel's Tokyo headquarters for a second time, only to be turned away at reception, said Lim Jae-sung, one of the attorneys.
The lawyers left documents at the reception regarding the case, Lim told a briefing at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan.
Lim said two options for seizing Nippon Steel's assets include shares of PNR, a joint venture between Nippon Steel and South Korean steel company POSCO, and intellectual property the company owns in South Korea.
Nippon Steel confirmed that it refused to meet the lawyers because its stance has not changed, a company spokeswoman said, adding that the company had received a letter, although she did not comment on the contents.
Asked about the Dec. 24 deadline, the spokeswoman said the company would consult the Japanese government and take appropriate action.

112,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2018 05:55AM ET</span>",Yemen's Houthis set to head to Sweden peace talks as U.N. warns on economy,"SANAA (Reuters) - A Yemeni Houthi delegation is expected to leave for Sweden on Tuesday for U.N.-sponsored peace talks, the first since 2016, as Western nations press for an end to the war that has pushed the impoverished country to the verge of starvation.
The nearly four-year-old conflict, which has killed thousands and spawned the world's most urgent humanitarian crisis, pits the Iranian-aligned Houthis against other Yemeni forces backed by a coalition loyal to President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
A Houthi official said their team would travel on a Kuwaiti plane accompanied by U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths, who arrived in the Houthi-held capital Sanaa on Monday.
Hadi's government is expected to follow the group, whose attendance was secured after the coalition allowed the evacuation of 50 wounded Houthis for treatment in Oman on Monday. Previous talks in Geneva in September had collapsed after three days when the Houthis failed to show up.
The warring parties are expected to convene in Sweden as early as Wednesday to discuss confidence-building measures and a transitional governing body, as the U.S. Senate is set to consider a resolution to end support for the war.
Outrage over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul has increased scrutiny of Riyadh's activities in the region, potentially giving Western powers, which provide arms and intelligence to the coalition greater leverage to demand action.
Germany, Denmark and Sweden have suspended arms exports to Saudi Arabia over Khashoggi's killing and the Yemen war. The United States halted refueling support for coalition warplanes.
The Western-backed alliance intervened in the war in 2015 to restore Hadi's government, which was ousted from Sanaa in 2014, but has bogged down in military stalemate.
CRITICAL JUNCTURE
The conflict, seen as a proxy war between Riyadh and Tehran, has left more than 8 million Yemenis facing famine although the United Nations has warned that could rise to 14 million. Three-quarters of the population, or 22 million, rely on aid.
U.N. aid chief Mark Lowcock said on Tuesday Yemen's government will need billions of dollars in external support to finance its 2019 budget and avoid another currency collapse in addition to $4 billion in aid.
UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said on Tuesday that the Sweden talks are a ""critical opportunity"".
""A sustainable Yemeni led political solution offers the best chance to ending the current crisis. A stable state, important for the region, cannot coexist with unlawful militias,"" he said.
Sweden's foreign ministry has yet to announce the venue of the talks, which will focus on reopening Sanaa airport and securing a prisoner swap and a ceasefire in Hodeidah port city, a lifeline for millions that is now a focus of the war.
This would serve as a foundation for a wider truce that would halt coalition air strikes that have killed thousands of civilians and Houthi missile attacks on Saudi cities.
""Yemenis need immediate relief as a stepping stone to longer term hope. The focus of the talks on the future management of the Hodeidah port and city and de-escalation of the fighting are important and welcome,"" David Miliband, President and CEO of the International Rescue Committee, said in a statement. 
The last available figure for the death toll from the United Nations was in 2016 and stood at more than 10,000. The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, a database that tracks violence in Yemen, says around 57,000 people have been reported killed since the beginning of 2016.
In Geneva, the United Nations' Lowcock told a news conference the government would need billions of dollars of support to finance the core functions of the state all over the country. Oil revenues, the main source of government income, had declined about 85 percent, leaving income at $2 billion.
""The country with the biggest problem in 2019 is going to be Yemen,"" he said.

113,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2018 05:52AM ET</span>",Shi'ite rivalry paralyzes Iraq's government,"By John Davison and Ahmed Rasheed
BAGHDAD (Reuters) - A growing rivalry between two powerful Shi'ite Muslim factions has paralyzed efforts to form a government in Iraq six months after an election aimed at steering the country toward recovery from years of war.
The two largest parliamentary groupings to emerge after the vote in May - one led by populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and the other by Iranian-backed militia leader Hadi al-Amiri - formed a tacit alliance in October when they picked a president and approved 14 out of 22 cabinet ministers.
But since then there has been stalemate, mainly over the empty interior ministry post dominated for years by allies of Amiri, who are backing the former head of a paramilitary force supported by Tehran. Sadr meanwhile says no one with a political affiliation should get the post.
A vote in parliament to fill the vacant ministries in Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi's cabinet has been repeatedly put back. 
Iraq's return to deadlocked parliamentary politics, now involving Shi'ite factions rather than the Sunni-Shi'ite sectarianism that followed the 2003 U.S.-led invasion, prompted a plea last week from Iraq's most senior Shi'ite cleric for politicians to work together.
That now looks all but impossible. As Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani made his remarks, the two sides broke off talks, lawmakers said.
""We reached a dead end,"" Hanin Qaddo, a member of the bloc led by Amiri, told Reuters on Friday. 
""There's no need for more delays, no use in talks,"" MP Ahmed al-Kinani said. ""We will go to parliament and vote for the rest of the cabinet."" 
He said they would do this without agreement from Sadr's supporters even though the parliamentary arithmetic is against them.
Sadr on Monday urged Abdul Mahdi to present the rest of his cabinet to parliament for approval as soon as possible, without disputed candidates. ""You must not submit to what is going on behind the scenes,"" Sadr told the prime minister.
Sadr, whose alliance won the most parliamentary seats in the election, has threatened to walk out of the political process and stage mass demonstrations as he has done in the past, notably when protesters stormed Baghdad's fortified Green Zone in 2016.
""If Bina (Amiri's bloc) ignores us then we will resort to all possible options including mobilizing the street,"" said a member of Sadr's alliance, who declined to give his name.
'THERE'S NO RECONSTRUCTION'
Whether Sadr's walk-out is imminent or not, the confrontation is paralyzing efforts to rebuild a country wrecked by its war with Islamic State and provide services in poor areas.
Flash floods killed several people last month, and militants still stage small-scale attacks. Local officials blame political infighting for failure to deliver services.
""There's no reconstruction or jobs here,"" said Sheikh Abu Mashan, a tribal leader in Anbar province. 
""Main electricity lines are still down. At first they said we'd get power by October. Now they say January. Authorities have no interest in us - they've spent nearly seven months talking and still have no government.""
The deadlock also means a 2019 budget has not been passed, so provinces do not know how much they will have to spend on fixing services.
""Heavy rainfall cut roads out of Mosul,"" governor official Nouruddin Catalan said. ""We don't even have enough money to fix roads damaged by fighting.""
Abdul Mahdi was seen by many parties as a compromise candidate for the post of prime minister who might form a government of independent technocrats capable of delivering services and reducing unemployment, the causes of protests that turned violent in September.
He was approved by both parliamentary groupings, which include Sunni parties. Sunnis and Kurds also hold cabinet posts.
But the power struggle between Sadr and Amiri has removed the initiative from the prime minister's hands, and away from parliament, analysts say.
""It's not up to him and it's not up to the parliamentarians - neither the executive nor the legislative branches of government have a say in forming the next cabinet,"" said Renad Mansour, a research fellow at Chatham House, a London think-tank.
""There's no leader yet who's able to sit the two sides together and get to the bottom of who will be interior (minister) ... it's become a matter of principle.""
These divisions among Shi'ite leaders could weaken Iranian influence in Iraq, which has grown since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein 15 years ago. 
If the split persists, Iran would prefer to see Amiri and his fellow militia leaders in a strong position. But while Iran will try to stop the divisions getting any worse, there is no sign yet that it has mediated between the two factions.
PREMIER'S TIME RUNNING OUT?
Lawmakers from Sadr's parliamentary group said they sent a message last week to Amiri's candidate for interior minister, Falih al-Fayyadh, the former head of a grouping that comprises Iraq's Shi'ite militias, asking him to step down.
MPs in Amiri's bloc told Reuters they would try to push Fayyadh through parliament after giving up on talks with the Sadists. Without agreement from Sadr, however, the vote is unlikely to pass, putting further pressure on Abdul Mahdi's crisis-hit government.
""Despite the difficulties the prime minister is facing in nominating interior and defense ministers, he should complete this formation and present names. Otherwise his government cannot really continue like this,"" said Dhiaa al-Asadi, a top adviser to Sadr.
The defense ministry is also in play, but the interior post is the main sticking point.
Asadi said Sadr would give Abdul Mahdi up to six months to form a full cabinet before withdrawing support.
Pressure is also coming from Amiri's side.
""If Abdul Mahdi is convinced ... that Fayyadh is the right candidate, he needs to present him,"" said Qais al-Khazali, a militia leader whose political wing has contributed lawmakers to Amiri's bloc.

""The prime minister doesn't currently have a majority bloc in parliament that would support his government for four years,"" Khazali said.

The incident in one of Kabul's most prosperous localities underlines the struggle of the Western-backed government to control powerful figures, whose armored cars carrying heavily armed gunmen are a common sight on the city's streets.
Afghan officials said at least one policeman was killed and six wounded in the gunbattle with the guards of Tamim Wardak, the owner of a security company whom some officials described as being related to a former defense minister.
Government forces finally arrested Wardak and 18 of his armed men, said interior ministry spokesman Najib Danish, after additional forces were despatched to disarm the gunmen and end an impasse that had forced shops and schools nearby to shut.
""One of his guards has been killed, and three wounded, but Wardak and all his men are in custody,"" Danish added.
The confrontation began on Monday afternoon, when Wardak's guards responded to the order for his eviction from a house he had illegally occupied for years by opening fire with automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades, security officials said.
Some security officials in Kabul, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to talk to the media, said Wardak was a relative of a former defense minister, Rahim Wardak. 
The former minister was not immediately available to comment.
Danish added that the government was working on a plan to close all illegal security companies and round up armed men from all over Afghanistan.

Insecurity was the top reason for pessimism in the Asia Foundation survey, cited by 72.5 percent of participants, followed by the economy and jobs, poor governance and endemic corruption, along with irregular electricity and water supply.
The survey of some 15,000 adults, the largest annual poll of its kind in Afghanistan, showed a mood of continuing gloom and uncertainty ahead of presidential elections in April and moves to open peace talks with the Taliban.
Only a third of those surveyed - 32.8 percent - said the country was moving in the right direction, the same proportion as last year, the survey said.
The level of optimism reflected ethnic and local differences, with the highest confidence levels in mainly Pashtun areas of the east and the lowest in the capital Kabul, the center and the north, areas where many ethnic Tajiks and Hazaras live.
Some 2,798 civilians have been killed and 5,252 wounded during the first nine months of 2018, according to U.N. data, a slight decline on the previous year but underscoring the continued violence in Afghanistan.
The United States has opened direct contacts with Taliban representatives to try to agree on the basis for peace talks, but heavy fighting drags on. 
The survey said 61.4 percent of respondents were satisfied with democracy - slightly higher than the previous poll - and more than half said the government had delivered some improvement in their living conditions. 
Support for the government of President Ashraf Ghani, who is expected to seek a second term in elections set for April 20, rose to 59.6 percent among those surveyed, from 56.2 percent in 2017.
At the start of the year, Ghani offered to hold peace talks with the Taliban but the insurgents have so far only agreed to talk with U.S. officials, leaving numerous questions open about the future of the process.

The survey found 53.5 percent believe reconciliation between the government and the Taliban is possible, up slightly from last year following the unexpected Eid-al Fitr ceasefire in June which offered a glimpse of peace after 17 years of war.

The anti-immigration Sweden Democrats hold the balance of power in parliament after the Sept. 9 vote and the center-left and center-right blocs have so far been unable to choose between doing a deal with a party that has roots in the white supremacist fringe to gain power or with each other. 
The center-left bloc of the Social Democrats, Greens and Left Party, are backed by 42.9 percent of voters against 40.7 in the election, the twice yearly poll by the Statistics Office showed.
The four-party, center-right Alliance opposition was supported by 37.5 percent down from 40.3 percent. The Sweden Democrats saw their support rise to 18.3 percent from 17.5 percent.
Since the election, law-makers have voted for Social Democrat Prime Minister Stefan Lofven's removal but have also rejected opposition Alliance leader Ulf Kristersson as premier.
Center leader Annie Loof, whose party is nominally part of the Alliance, has offered to support Lofven if he agrees to cut taxes and free up business regulations, and parliament will vote for a second time on Lofven as prime minister, possibly later this week. 
The Statistics Office polled 4,721 voters between Oct. 29 and Nov. 27.

China is North Korea's most important economic and diplomatic backer, despite its anger at the country's nuclear and missile programs.
Ties have warmed in the last year, as Pyongyang's relations with both Seoul and Washington have also improved dramatically.
Ri Yong Ho will also meet the Chinese government's top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, during a visit set to run from Thursday until Saturday, said Geng Shuang, a spokesman for the foreign ministry.
The two will have a ""deep exchange of views"" on China-North Korea relations, the situation on the Korean peninsula and other issues of mutual concern, Geng told a daily news briefing, without giving details.
The visit will have a positive effect on promoting ties, as well as on communication and cooperation on Korean peninsula and other issues, he added.
Geng declined to comment when asked if the two sides would discuss plans for a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to North Korea, saying he had no information he could provide.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has visited China three times this year for meetings with Xi. Diplomatic sources say Xi will probably go to North Korea at some point soon. 
On Saturday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he was likely to meet Kim again in January or February, with three sites being considered for their second meeting.

121,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2018 03:25AM ET</span>",Israel military says to expose Hezbollah attack tunnels from Lebanon,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's military said on Tuesday it had begun an operation to ""expose and thwart"" cross-border attack tunnels from Lebanon dug by the Lebanese militia Hezbollah.
Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus said the military had detected tunnels crossing from Lebanon into northern Israel. He said the Israeli operation to counter the tunnels would be inside Israel, and would not cross the border.
Israel released video footage of digging and pile-driving equipment at work in unidentified locations with trees and bushes in the background, carrying out what it said were ""tactical preparations to expose Hezbollah's offensive cross-border tunnel project."" Reuters could not immediately verify the footage.
On Monday, Netanyahu met with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Brussels. An Israeli government source said the purpose of the meeting was to update Pompeo of the upcoming tunnel operation.
The current focus of operations was near the Israeli border town Metulla, Conricus said, adding that some areas near the border fence had been closed off. An Israeli military source said the operation might take weeks to complete.
The military said the tunnels were not yet operational but posed ""an imminent threat"" to Israeli civilians, and constituted ""a flagrant and severe violation of Israeli sovereignty.""
It said the army had ""enhanced its presence and readiness"" and was prepared for ""various scenarios"".
Israel and Iranian-backed Shi'ite Hezbollah last fought a war in 2006, but tensions have been rising in recent months.
During an address to the United Nations in September, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu identified three locations in Lebanon where, he said, Hezbollah was converting “inaccurate projectiles” into precision-guided missiles. He warned the group that Israel would not let it ""get away with it.""
A few weeks ago Netanyahu also hinted at an upcoming Israeli offensive during a televised address. He offered no details, but said: ""I will not say this evening when we will act and how. I have a clear plan. I know what to do and when to do it. And we will do it.""
He said an upcoming security challenge would require Israelis to ""endure sacrifice.""
Israel’s vulnerability to tunnels was laid bare during its war with Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza in 2014. 
What began then as shelling exchanges with Hamas escalated into a ground offensive after Palestinian militants used dozens of secret passages dug from Gaza into Israel to launch surprise attacks. 
Hezbollah, founded in 1982 by Iran's Revolutionary Guards, has grown stronger since the 2006 war with Israel, notably through its role in the Syrian war fighting in support of President Bashar al-Assad.
Over the past decade, Israel and Hezbollah have largely maintained a stand-off - the group has rarely launched attacks into Israel from Lebanon and Israel has rarely struck against the group on Lebanese soil.

But in the past few years Israel has struck dozens of times inside Syria at what it said were advanced weapon deliveries to Hezbollah.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The brother of Australian cricket star Usman Khawaja was charged on Tuesday with creating what police described as fake plans for attacks against prominent people that led to the imprisonment of another man he saw as a rival for the affections of a woman.
Arsalan Tariq Khawaja was granted bail in Sydney's Parramatta Local Court on Tuesday afternoon on charges of attempting to pervert the course of justice and forgery. He was arrested in western Sydney earlier as part of a New South Wales Joint Counter Terrorism Team investigation.
Police allege 39-year-old Arsalan Khawaja created a fake document ""containing plans that purported to facilitate terrorism attacks"". The document led them to arrest and imprison 25-year-old Mohamed Kamer Nizamdeen in August.
Nizamdeen was released in October after it was shown his handwriting did not match that in the document, which domestic media reported included threats against then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull and others.
""We regret what happened to Mr Nizamdeen. But, really, the person who is responsible for what occurred to him is the person we're alleging manufactured this document,"" Assistant Police Commissioner Mick Willing told reporters in Sydney.
""We will be alleging that he was set up in a planned and calculated manner,"" he said.
Willing said police believed the plot was motivated by a grievance over a woman who was courted by both men.
Police said there was no actual threat related to the document they allege Khawaja fabricated.
The arrest came just two days before his brother, Usman, is expected to play for Australia in the first test match of a four-game series against India in Adelaide.
""This is a matter for the police to deal with,"" Usman Khawaja said a statement he read out in Adelaide on Tuesday.

""Out of respect for the process it'd be inappropriate for me to be making any further comment. I just ask for you to please respect my privacy and my family's privacy during this time,"" he said.

HAVANA (Reuters) - Tania Bruguera and several other Cuban artists were detained in Havana on Monday after trying to stage a protest against a new decree that they fear will hamper creativity and increase censorship of Cuban culture.
Bruguera, the most high-profile of the detainees, was arrested shortly after leaving her home in the morning and before reaching the ministry of culture where the artists intended to hold their protest, her mother, Argelia Fernandez, told Reuters.
The performance artist, who has been arrested before for publicly protesting against the Communist government, was released in the evening, Fernandez said, but immediately went to the ministry to demonstrate against the arrests of other artists.
""All I can do is show solidarity,"" Bruguera wrote on her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page early on Monday evening, posting a photo of herself wearing a T-shirt with the words ""No to the Decree 349"". ""If they detain me, I will be on hunger and thirst strike.""
Bruguera was reportedly detained again on Monday evening, according to Iris Ruiz, an actress and the coordinator of what has been a rare campaign in recent months against Decree 349, one of the first pieces of legislation to be signed by Miguel Diaz-Canel since he succeeded Raul Castro as president in April. 
Fernandez told Reuters she had no means of locating her daughter because her cellphone appeared to have been blocked by state security.
Brief detentions are the standard response to opposition street protests in a country that frowns on public dissent and views dissidents as mercenaries in the pay of the United States to subvert the government.
Cuban officials do not typically comment on such police activity.
With Decree 349 due to come into force on Friday, protesters decided to step up their campaign with a demonstration all week on the steps of the culture ministry that would include poetry readings and performances.
Ruiz said her husband, the poet Amaury Pacheco, and another artist were detained after arriving together at the culture ministry on Monday morning.
Three other artists who also headed there, including campaign leader Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara, could not be located, suggesting they had also been detained, Ruiz said. Otero Alcantara's phone appeared to be turned off.
Few Cuban artists have chosen to protest against the decree publicly but unease is widespread in the island's creative community and among Western diplomats in Havana. Amnesty International has called it a ""dystopian prospect"".

Cuban authorities, however, have insisted it merely aims to prevent tax evasion and the spread of bad, pseudo-culture, and say that the issue is being manipulated by counter-revolutionaries.

Papua has suffered a simmering separatist conflict since it was incorporated into Indonesia after a widely criticized U.N.-backed referendum in 1969 and remains one of its poorest regions.
Colonel Muhammad Aidi said security forces were trying to confirm a report from a priest that 24 men from the construction company PT Istaka Karya working in the Yigi district had been ""sadistically slaughtered"" by an armed criminal separatist group. 
Police and military personnel were trying to reach the area after receiving the report via a radio transmission though communications were difficult due to a lack of electricity in the area, Aidi said.
""According to the report we received, it started with an armed criminal separatist group holding a ceremony to commemorate what they claim to be their independence day on Dec 1,"" Aidi told Metro TV. 
Aidi said that one of the workers appeared to have taken a photograph which angered the group and sparked the killings.
Some Papuans regard Dec. 1 as their independence day from Dutch colonial rule, raising a banned separatist flag and holding rallies.
At the weekend, police detained more than 500 Papuans staging rallies to commemorate what they view as the 57th anniversary of Papua's independence in several cities across Indonesia, including 233 students in Indonesia's second-biggest city of Surabaya, according to media site Tempo.com.
Aidi said the bodies of the construction workers were believed to be near the bridge they were building.
Since coming to power in 2014, President Widodo has pledged to hasten development and open up access to the resource-rich province including through the Trans Papua road project to link remote areas in the province. 
Indonesia's Public Works Minister Basuki Hadimuljono told a briefing construction on the bridges to connect the Trans Papua road would be postponed until the area was secured.
While separatists have often been blamed for carrying out attacks, Indonesia's human rights commission has also urged President Widodo to end rights violations by security forces in Papua, an area where access by foreign media has often been restricted.

It is the latest in a series of boat departures from Myanmar and Bangladesh, from where Rohingya Muslims have attempted to flee to Malaysia in recent weeks, raising fears of a fresh wave of such dangerous voyages after a 2015 crackdown on people smugglers.
The disaster mitigation agency in East Aceh said men they described as Rohingya refugees landed in the town of Kuala Idi and were being given food and water.
Immigration authorities told Reuters they were on their way to the region to question the group. 
The chief of a fishing community in the area said the group was bound for Malaysia and it was unclear why it had landed in Indonesia.
""Their boat is still working and they have fuel, so we don't know why they entered our area,"" said Razali, who goes by one name, in Kuala Idi on the eastern coast of Aceh where the boat landed.
The men were mostly in their 20s, he said.
It was not immediately clear if the boat had originated in Myanmar or Bangladesh. Thousands of Rohingya landed in Indonesia and Malaysia in 2015 after they were left stranded in the Andaman Sea in the wake of a crackdown on people smugglers.
Authorities in Myanmar seized a boat carrying 93 people fleeing from Rohingya camps in Rakhine state last month, one of several boats attempting the journey to Malaysia.
Myanmar regards Rohingya as illegal migrants from the Indian subcontinent and has confined tens of thousands to sprawling camps in Rakhine state since violence swept the area in 2012.
More than 700,000 Rohingya crossed into Bangladesh last year fleeing an army crackdown in the north of Rakhine State, according to U.N. agencies.
The latest departures come as Myanmar prepares to take some of the refugees back after agreeing with Bangladesh to start repatriations on Nov. 15, despite widespread opposition from Rohingya, who say they will not return without guarantees of basic rights, including citizenship and freedom of movement.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in said on Tuesday a visit to Seoul by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was ""a possibility"" and that such a trip would help to improve Pyongyang's relationship with the United States.
Moon made the comment when asked by reporters during a state visit to New Zealand about the likely timing of a possible trip to Seoul by Kim, who held summits with Moon and U.S. President Donald Trump this year.
""This will be the first time that a North Korean leader will visit South Korea so, although there is no time frame set for that, still that's very meaningful,"" Moon said.
He said such a visit would ""accelerate the denuclearization in the Korean peninsula"" and result in a ""greater stride in relations improvement"" between the North and the United States.
South Korea has been seeking to balance progressing its relationship with the North while also keeping Washington onside.
Trump and Kim announced after their landmark summit in Singapore in June that they had agreed to work toward the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, although the two sides have since made little progress agreeing on a timeline or other concrete steps.
North Korea has been angered by Washington's refusal to ease sanctions and has warned it could resume development of its nuclear program. 
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said last month Trump would push for a concrete plan outlining Pyongyang's moves to end its nuclear and missile programs.
Trump signaled on Saturday he was likely to meet Kim again in January or February.
Moon spoke shortly after a meeting with New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern where they discussed how to secure a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
""New Zealand's stance on nuclear non-proliferation is clear and it is our hope that 2019 will see further progress toward achieving denuclearization of North Korea in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner and an enduring peace on the Korean peninsula,"" Ardern said in an emailed statement.
New Zealand has been working with the United States to help small Pacific nations audit and strengthen their shipping registers to avoid vessels with ties to North Korea using their flags to skirt sanctions.
Multiple ships linked to prohibited North Korean activities were identified after a training workshop with 14 Pacific nations in July, a senior U.S. State Department official told Reuters, without identifying how many ships or the countries involved.
Reuters reported in 2017 that Fiji had identified more than 20 vessels with ties to North Korea using its flag illegally.

A court last Friday sentenced two senior police officials to up to 10 years in prison for running an underground online gambling ring which illegally raised hundreds of millions of dollars.
""Reports will be discounted if providers do not declare their full name, address and telephone number, or supply insufficient, vague or unsubstantiated information,"" the official Vietnam News Agency (VNA) said, citing a Ministry of Public Security statement.
""They will also be discounted if callers insult the officers on duty,"" VNA said.
Vietnam's graft crackdown has seen the Communist-ruled government launch investigations into hundreds of public officials accused of mismanagement. 
Several executives at state-owned enterprises, including one former politburo member, have been jailed for mismanagement or embezzlement.
Beyond those high-profile cases, petty corruption in Vietnam is commonplace, and road users are often forced to pay on-the-spot cash bribes to traffic police for minor offences.
An official who answered the hotline's phone number on Tuesday told Reuters it had been previously used to report traffic police only, but now accepted complaints about corruption in the entire police force.
The official, who was not authorized to speak to the media, declined to say how many calls a day were made to the hotline.

TIJUANA, Mexico (Reuters) - Central American migrants stuck on the threshold of the United States in Mexico breached the border fence on Monday, risking almost certain detention by U.S. authorities but hoping the illegal entry will allow them to apply for asylum.
Since mid-October, thousands of Central Americans, mostly from Honduras, have traveled north through Mexico toward the United States in a caravan, some walking much of the long trek.
U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to stop the migrants entering, sending troops to reinforce the border and attempting a procedural change, so far denied by the courts, to require asylum-seekers to remain in Mexico while their cases are heard.
Frustrated and exhausted after weeks of uncertainty, many of the migrants have become desperate since getting stuck in squalid camps in the Mexican border city of Tijuana.
So a number opted to eschew legal procedures and attempt an illegal entry from Tijuana as dusk fell on Monday at a spot about 1,500 feet (450 meters) away from the Pacific Ocean.
In less than an hour, Reuters reporters observed roughly two dozen people climb the approximately 10-foot (3-meter) fence made of thick sheets and pillars of metal. They chose a place in a large overgrown ditch where the fence is slightly lower.
Just before dusk, three thin people squeezed through the fence on the beach and were quickly picked up by the U.S. Border Patrol, witnesses said.
But along the border inland as darkness descended, more and more migrants followed, many bringing children.
Some used a blanket as a rope to help loved ones get over. 
A mother and her children made it over the first fence and disappeared into the night.
The sight of them climbing the fence encouraged others, even as a helicopter patrolled overhead on the U.S. side.
Earlier, Karen Mayeni, a 29-year-old Honduran, sized up the fence while clinging to her three children, aged six, 11 and 12. 
""We're just observing, waiting to see what happens,"" Mayeni said. ""We'll figure out what to do in a couple of days.""
Ninety minutes later, she and her family were over the fence.
A number of the migrants ran to try to escape capture, but most of them walked slowly to where U.S. Border Patrol officials were waiting under floodlights to hand themselves in.
'STAND ON MY HEAD'
Some of the migrants are likely to be economic refugees without a strong asylum claim, but others tell stories of receiving politically motivated death threats in a region troubled by decades of instability and violence.
Applying for asylum at a U.S. land border can take months, so if migrants enter illegally and present themselves to authorities, their cases could be heard quicker.
U.S. officials have restricted applications through the Chaparral gate in Tijuana to between 40 and 100 per day.
Some may hope to defeat the odds and penetrate one of the most fortified sections of the southern U.S. border.
Those that made it across the fence in Tijuana still had to scramble up a hill and contend with a more forbidding wall to reach California, and U.S. Border Patrol agents had the territory between the two barriers heavily covered.
""Climb up. You can do it! Stand on my head!"" one migrant said, egging his companion on.

One child and his mother got over the fence and ran up the hill behind. They turned around and waved to those still on the Mexican side.

The additional staff will be based in Samoa, Tonga, Fiji, Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Kiribati, and the U.S. state of Hawaii, Peters said in a statement.
The move comes amid growing Western concerns about China's influence in the South Pacific through its Belt and Road initiative, which dominated a recent Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) summit hosted by Papua New Guinea.
""These new positions are a first step in demonstrating New Zealand is committed to the Pacific to help it be ... safer and more prosperous and enhancing New Zealand's voice in a region,"" Peters said.

134,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2018 09:34PM ET</span>","In 'new Malaysia', race continues to cast a long shadow","By Joseph Sipalan
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Just months after a stunning election victory, Malaysia's prime minister has had to step in to mollify the country's majority Malay Muslims in recent weeks, underlining a weighty challenge confronting his multi-ethnic, reformist coalition: race.
When riots erupted at a Hindu temple outside the capital, Kuala Lumpur, last week, 93-year-old Mahathir Mohamad spared no effort to scotch speculation that tensions with Malays were to blame.
Just a few days earlier, his government reversed its pledge to ratify a U.N. convention against racial discrimination following a backlash from groups who argued that it would dilute privileges Malays have enjoyed for decades.
The two incidents illustrate the predicament confronting Mahathir as euphoria over the May election fades: curbing racial divisions, carrying out reform and reassuring Malays that affirmative-action policies favoring them in business, education and housing are not about to disappear.
And Mahathir's unlikely alliance - known as Pakatan Harapan, or Pact of Hope - has to do that without upsetting the delicate balance of its constituent parties.
""The problem with Pakatan Harapan as a multiracial coalition is that it is not seen as championing the Malays,"" said a deputy minister, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue. 
He said opposition parties are successfully fanning a perception that Malays, about 60 percent of the country's 32 million people, are being abandoned in what some have called 'New Malaysia'. 
Malaysia's ethnic Chinese are estimated at 23 percent while mostly Hindu ethnic Indians comprise about 7 percent, government data shows.
Mahathir ousted the long-ruling coalition led by the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), which has pushed positive discrimination for Malays to avoid a repeat of bloody Chinese-Malay riots in 1969. Mahathir was prime minister for two decades at the head of UMNO, before he fell out with his successors.
In the May election, Mahathir's coalition won overwhelming support from ethnic Chinese and Indian minorities, but it secured the votes of only 30 percent of Malay voters, according to estimates by independent polling firm Merdeka Center.
About 40 percent of Malays backed the beleaguered government of former Prime Minister Najib Razak, an UMNO grandee who is now facing multiple graft charges, and the rest voted for Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS), a conservative Islamic party.
A Merdeka poll in August showed that concerns over ethnic issues and religious rights had grown since the election, with about 21 percent citing those issues as a concern compared with 12 percent in April.
WHICH CROWD TO PLEASE?
For many Malays, the ouster of Najib over the multi-billion-dollar corruption scandal that had swirled for years around the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) sovereign wealth fund was fair enough.
But some have been dismayed by moves made by the government of Mahathir - himself once a champion of the Malay 'bumiputera', or 'sons of the soil' policy - such as the appointment of non-Malays as minister of finance and attorney general. 
A lawmaker in the ruling coalition said the initial plan to ratify the U.N. International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination fed a narrative pushed by UMNO and PAS that the government is out of touch with the Malay community, especially the working class.
""The Malays are more focused on socio-economic issues, and if you don't focus on their poverty and hardships, obviously they'll get worked up,"" said the lawmaker, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media. 
Mujahid Yusof Rawa, minister in charge of religious affairs, conceded that the coalition is struggling to convince Malays that its policies will benefit them and protect Islamic values.
""We have had some success in reaching out to them, but if we fail to build on that, it will affect support from Malay voters,"" he said.
Mahathir, who was prime minister from 1981 to 2003 and is now the oldest elected leader in the world, remains a sharp political operator: many expect he will take steps to shore up Malay support for his government.
It was Mahathir who snuffed out controversy over the U.N. treaty by dropping it, and amid the Hindu temple unrest he promised action to keep the peace, acknowledging that ""such incidents ... can lead to bigger problems involving racial harmony.""
His administration has also refused to deport an Indian Islamic preacher, Zakir Naik, who is popular among conservative Malay Muslims but is being investigated by Indian authorities for alleged hate speech. Naik began a five-day speaking tour in a northern state last week.
But steps that pander to Malays could create rifts within Mahathir's alliance, which includes the Chinese-led Democratic Action Party and the pro-reform party of former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim. There is an understanding that Mahathir will eventually hand power to Anwar, but the two men have fallen out before. 

""As things currently stand, the Malay opposition are saying the government is being dominated by the Democratic Action Party and weak on Malay interests and that it is delivering far less than promised,"" said Ibrahim Suffian, director of pollster Merdeka. ""The danger is that if they try to please one crowd, they push away the other.""

Jalisco state prosecutors said on Twitter that six state police were killed and one was injured in a shootout in the municipality of La Huerta on the Pacific coast, just days after an attack on a U.S. consulate in the local capital Guadalajara.
A spokeswoman for state prosecutors said it was not clear who was responsible for the killings, but that the area was known to be the territory of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), one of the most powerful drug gangs in Mexico.
La Huerta borders with the municipality of Villa Purificacion, where in May 2015 CJNG members shot down an army helicopter during a failed attempt to capture the gang's leader Nemesio Oseguera, a former policeman known as ""El Mencho"".
On Saturday, officials said they were investigating an apparent grenade attack on the U.S. consulate in Guadalajara. No one was injured in the attack, which occurred days before the new Jalisco governor, Enrique Alfaro, takes office.
Lopez Obrador, who took power on Saturday, has given top priority to quelling gang violence, which has claimed tens of thousands of lives during the past two administrations.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Monday criticized sanctions on Venezuela during a visit to Caracas, while President Nicolas Maduro defended the country's right to export gold after U.S. sanctions last month targeted its shipments of the metal.
Washington has imposed sanctions on Venezuelan officials it accuses of corruption, and on certain financial transactions with the Maduro government, which it accuses of violating human rights and triggering an economic meltdown. Ties between Turkey and the United States, two NATO allies, have also been strained. 
U.S. President Donald Trump last month signed an executive order banning anyone in the United States from dealing with entities and people involved in ""corrupt or deceptive"" gold sales from the South American country. Turkey this year has become the largest importer of non-monetary gold from Venezuela.
""Political problems cannot be resolved by punishing an entire nation,"" Erdogan said, with Maduro by his side at a forum attended by business people from both countries. ""We do not approve of these measures that ignore the rules of global trade.""
Venezuela is suffering a bout of hyperinflation and a fifth year of recession that has led to shortages of food and medicine. Maduro frequently blames a U.S. ""economic war"" for the country's woes, but critics say the crisis is proof socialist policies started under his predecessor Hugo Chavez have failed. 
While Erdogan did not directly mention the United States or Trump, he said his ""friend"" Maduro was facing ""manipulative attacks from certain countries and acts of sabotage from economic assassins."" In response, Erdogan said he was willing to strengthen trade ties.
Trade between the two countries have been growing, with Turkish data showing the country imported $900 million in gold from Venezuela in the first nine months of the year. Without naming the United States, Maduro decried sanctions and said Venezuela had the right to sell gold. 
""It is very petty to try to use an illegal sanction to prevent Venezuela from selling its gold to the world,"" Maduro said during a joint press conference later on Monday with Erdogan, who also visited Paraguay after attending the Group of 20 summit in Argentina last weekend.

China's backing is helping the sport, also known as ping-pong, establish an unlikely foothold in the Pacific nation better known for its love-affair with rugby league.

PNG's top players were also given the opportunity to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on his trip to Port Moresby in November - a visit marked by open hostility between China and the United States over their competing ambitions for the region. 
In a PNG newspaper editorial just before his visit, Xi wrote of his goal to ""write a new chapter in people-to-people friendship"", providing sport as an example.
The wrap-around effort from China's head of state, officials, businesses, and sports stars is part of a soft power push that represents the next phase of Xi's hallmark Belt and Road program at a time when Western nations are trading barbs with China over its growing clout in the Pacific. 
""They're all trying to implement the policies and the goals (of) President Xi Jinping,"" said George Shao, a Port Moresby-based Chinese businessman and president of the PNG Table Tennis Federation. ""It's a...platform to improve peoples' relationship from the two countries...we are connected together.""
Much of China's connection to the South Pacific to date has been through large-scale infrastructure projects that have resulted in hefty debt burdens to the mostly small and poor island nations.
PNG holds the largest debt to China in the South Pacific, at almost $590 million, largely for infrastructure projects such as roads, stadiums, university buildings and fish processing plants. 
The West has raised concerns that PNG's debt burden makes it vulnerable to political influence from Beijing. Last month, the United States and Australia pledged to build a naval base in PNG, shutting out a rival Chinese proposal over fears the facility could one day host Chinese military vessels in the strategically important area.
""They're 'softening' it with efforts such as the ping-pong diplomacy,"" said Stanley Rosen, an expert in Chinese politics at the University of Southern (NYSE:SO) California's US-China Institute. ""Soft power will be increasingly used in the Pacific."" 
SOFT POWER PUSH
Almost 50 years ago, China and the United States used ""ping-pong diplomacy"" to help mend relations, with an exchange of players clearing the way for U.S. President Richard Nixon to visit China in 1972.
Along with table tennis, China is also ramping up Mandarin language classrooms and university scholarships around the South Pacific. Beijing has also purchased radio frequencies in the region and has deployed a Navy hospital ship to provide medical treatment, including traditional Chinese medicine.
Still, table tennis is unlikely to ever overtake rugby league in a country where locals pour onto fields to play in the evenings and where violence between passionate supporters of rival teams sometimes breaks out. 
In a training center provided by a Chinese developer, PNG's national players slip off their flip flops and leave them beneath tables on a specialist bright red sports floor, both donated by sports equipment firm Shanghai Double Happiness.
The players have also received grants from the Chinese embassy for tables and are in talks to see whether it will fund a full-time Chinese coach, as it does in Vanuatu.
Members of the national team are sent to China before big international competitions for weeks of training, funded by Chinese local governments and training institutions.
""Shanghai is a nice place so when I heard that we were going to Shanghai I was very happy, excited to go,"" said Geoffrey Loi, an 18-year-old high school student who is seen as PNG's best chance at a place in the Paris Olympics in 2024. ""They have the best training facilities and the best coach...we learned a lot of things.""
Numbers are still small, with around 20 players on the national team and about 300 taking part in competitions, but experts say it provides a foothold in the battle for hearts and minds. 
""At least China starts somewhere by...engaging with ordinary citizens,"" said Teddy Winn, a politics academic at the University of Papua New Guinea. 
Rea Loi, the team's coach and Geoffrey's father, said he was proud of how far his sport had come with the support of China.

""There are famous sports in Papua New Guinea, greater sports...but no other sports were involved, who got to meet President Xi Jinping, only table tennis.""

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's right-wing President-elect Jair Bolsonaro is considering placing indigenous affairs under the ministry of agriculture, his future chief of staff said on Monday, a move that could give ranchers an upper hand in land conflicts.
Bolsonaro's top aide Onyx Lorenzoni told reporters the move has not been decided yet, but said Bolsonaro believes that native tribes should be able to integrate to improve their living standards.
The plan reflects Bolsonaro's view that Brazil's indigenous people should not be kept apart from society on reservations and their lands should be opened to commercial activities that are currently banned.
In Brazil, killings over land are common and seldom punished, as powerful landowners, who often wield influence over local police and government officials, clash with farmers and others for control of lucrative agricultural and logging land. 
Fights over land resulted in the killings of 71 activists and indigenous people in 2017, according to the Pastoral Land Commission (CPT), a watchdog linked to the Catholic Church. It was the bloodiest year since 2003. 
Six of those killed last year were members of indigenous tribes trying to protect their reserves, according to the CPT's annual report on rural violence, most of which takes place in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest region. 
'LIKE US' 
Bolsonaro last week repeated his vow to stop creating new reservations and compared the indigenous peoples living on them to animals trapped in a zoo. He has said the tribes should be allowed to charge royalties for the extraction of minerals on their lands. 
""The natives want doctors, dentists, television, internet. We will give them the means to be like us,"" Bolsonaro, who takes office Jan. 1, said at a military academy graduation ceremony.
Some 517,000 natives, about two-thirds of Brazil's indigenous population, live on reservations that represent 12.5 percent of the country's territory.
Environmentalists say the indigenous on the reservations are the best guardians of Brazil's tropical forests and their biodiversity. The issue has gained more importance as the destruction of Brazil's Amazon hit a decade high, the government said last month.
That destruction is primarily caused by illegal logging, ranching and farming, officials say. Anthropologists and rights say allowing mining companies into reservations would also destroy native cultures.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - In just 48 hours in office, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has stamped a marked change of style on Mexican politics, with hands-on policies and symbolic moves aimed at narrowing the gap between the government and the people.
On Monday, he held his first news conference, promising to repeat the exercise every weekday at 7 a.m. - a contrast to predecessor Enrique Pena Nieto, who rarely took journalists' questions, preferring to deliver stage-managed speeches. 
The 65-year-old veteran leftist spoke on a range of subjects but, flanked by his security cabinet, spent most of the time talking about plans to personally take charge of stemming a cycle of cartel-led violence that has claimed more than 200,000 lives. 
""It is so important to guarantee peace and tranquility in the country that I am not going to delegate this responsibility, I am going to attend to it directly.""
Lopez Obrador promised a daily update on the violence, including how many people are murdered, adding that 50 people were killed on each of his first two days in government, a number he claimed was already lower than the average.
He flagged he was seeking commitments from Canada and the United States to invest in Mexico and Central America to slow illegal immigration, and said he had yet to discuss strategies to tackle cartels with U.S. President Donald Trump.
While refreshing for Mexicans tired of remote leaders, the shift from a measured to a more freewheeling manner has rattled some - most notably markets that responded badly to abrupt policy shifts announced while his was still president-elect.
In the conference the former Mexico City mayor tried to address concerns around his plan to cancel a $13 billion partially built airport in the capital, saying investors in the project would be protected. At the same time, aides offered to pay upfront a portion of debt issued to fund the airport.
A few hours later, he dispatched Pena Nieto's luxurious and nearly new Dreamliner presidential jet to California to be sold. He is putting most of the rest of the federal government's fleet of planes and helicopters up for sale.
Lopez Obrador, who prefers to travel coach, was photographed on local airline Aeromar on his first trip as president on Sunday. 

In a similar vein, the new government opened to the public the opulent Los Pinos residence used by every president since the 1930s and plans to turn it into a cultural center. Instead, Lopez Obrador says he will live in more modest quarters.

PANAMA CITY (Reuters) - Panama and China on Monday signed 19 cooperation agreements on trade, infrastructure, banking, tourism and other areas on Chinese President Xi Jinping's inaugural visit to the isthmus nation after the two countries opened diplomatic ties last year.
Xi arrived on Sunday night in Panama City for a 24-hour visit at a time when China is extending its influence in Central America, to the mounting chagrin of the United States, which has long viewed the region as its backyard.
After a private meeting, Xi and Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela sealed the 19 accords, including one under which China will provide non-reimbursable aid to Panama to carry out various projects, though the amount was not disclosed.
The accords included an extradition treaty and memoranda of understanding on commercial, tourist, educational matters.
Varela thanked the Chinese leader for his visit, and recalled that when opening an import fair in China in November, Xi had told him China's economy was an ocean.
""I want to complement those words by saying Panama connects two oceans, and his visit consolidates our country as China's commercial arm and gateway to Latin America,"" Varela said in a televised address.
In June last year, Panama broke diplomatic relations with Taiwan and established ties with China instead. This year, the Dominican Republic and El Salvador did the same, and other countries in the region may soon follow suit.
The diplomatic breaks sparked concern in Washington, which in August said that Beijing is offering economic incentives in order to dominate the countries.
However, relations between the United States and Central America have been tested by the U.S. presidency of Donald Trump.
Trump has threatened to cut aid to the region if Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador do not curtail the illegal immigration of their citizens to the United States.
Taiwan has formal ties with 17 countries, many of them small nations in Central America, the Caribbean and the Pacific.
Beijing regards Taiwan as a rebel province.

Panama, which is negotiating a free trade agreement with China, has played down the complaints of the United States, and says that its relationship with Washington is solid.

Bongo suffered a stroke while at a conference in Saudi Arabia on Oct. 24, sources told Reuters. 
The presidency initially said he was struggling with severe fatigue and later said he had some ""bleeding"" that required medical attention. 
Bongo's wife last week said he was traveling to Morocco to continue his recovery.
No one, however, has shared specific details on Bongo's condition. With his exact condition and whereabouts unknown, unsubstantiated rumors have swirled that he was incapacitated or dead.
Gabon's top court ruled last month that the vice president would chair the cabinet in Bongo's absence.
In the short video clip shared with journalists, Bongo appears sitting down in a blue and white robe alongside his old friend, Moroccan King Mohammed VI. The two men are seen chatting briefly, though the video has no sound. 
At one point, Bongo, who is seated at a right angle to the camera, the right side of his face obscured, sips on what appears to be a glass of milk.

The Bongo family has ruled the oil-producing West African country for nearly half a century. Bongo has been president since succeeding his father, Omar, who died in 2009. His re-election in 2016 was marred by violent protests amid claims of fraud.

The embassy and other facilities in the capital Kinshasa have been shut since Nov. 26 and U.S. citizens were advised to ""keep a low profile"". 
U.S. officials have remained tight-lipped in public about the nature of the threat, but have informed foreign diplomats that the embassy closure is due to the arrest last month of a cell of Tanzanian jihadists from a Ugandan Islamist group called the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), two diplomats told Reuters.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador signed a decree on Monday to set up a commission tasked with determining what happened to 43 missing and presumed killed trainee teachers kidnapped in 2014, a crime that continues to loom large in the country.
""This is a matter of state,"" Lopez Obrador said at an event with parents of the missing on his first weekday in office, following his inauguration on Saturday. He also offered protection to witnesses so they could safely tell their stories.
""We are not going to wash our hands of this,"" he said, promising that no obstacles will prevent the truth from being revealed.
Lopez Obrador said even the army could be investigated by the commission, which has been a key demand of family members and experts who believe that members of the military have information about the case that has yet to see the light of day. 
""The investigation has to include all of the government, anyone involved,"" said Lopez Obrador, including any ""members of the military that might have been involved.""
In the past, supporters of the army have said it should not be subject to the same transparency as other parts of the government, a posture critics say helps hide the truth.
Lopez Obrador's foreign ministry has also invited international organizations to take part in the commission, including the United Nations, which will observe the process, as well as the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which will be responsible for managing a group of independent investigators. 
According to the previous government's assessment, the students, who were studying at a teachers' training college in Ayotzinapa in the violent southwestern state of Guerrero, were rounded up by corrupt police who handed them over to a gang that murdered them and burned their remains in a nearby dump.
But in a report released in 2015, international experts flagged deep flaws in the official investigation and rejected its central claim that the victims were incinerated in a garbage dump in Cocula, a city in the Pacific state of Jalisco. 

Lopez Obrador has placed an early focus on trying to pacify Mexico, which has suffered some 200,000 murders and numerous rights violations in a war on drug cartels that began a dozen years ago.

The southern African nation is short of U.S. dollars, the currency it adopted in 2009, causing price spikes and shortages of basic goods, medicines and fuel.
Mathabisi Bebhe, secretary general of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association which represents more than 1,000 members, said most junior doctors at the five major hospitals had downed tools to protest over pay, allowances and drugs' shortages.
More than half of public sector doctors joined the indefinite strike, he said.
With hospitals already short of drugs and reliant on patients to buy them, local pharmacies are no longer accepting insurance policies for purchases, instead demanding U.S. dollars in cash. When using bank cards, prices are at least three times higher. 
""We are understaffed and underpaid and there are no medications in the hospitals,"" Bebhe said.
""We are really hopeful that the government will intervene as early as possible. The duration of the industrial action depends on when the government gives a proper practical solution.""
Health Minister Obadiah Moyo could not be reached for comment. The government has previously said doctors should present their grievances while at work and has relied on military doctors to help at state hospitals during strikes
At United Bulawayo Hospitals in the city of Bulawayo, senior doctors were only tending to emergency cases after closing the outpatient department, according to a notice to staff.
In March, the doctors went on strike and won an increase in pay and allowances, ending the first big labor dispute Mnangagwa faced since taking power.
But doctors were still struggling to survive, Bebhe said, after prices of basic goods rose by at least 300 percent since October. Annual inflation was 20.85 percent that month, the first time it has hit double digits in a decade.
The doctors, who earn a basic monthly salary of about $385 before allowances, are also pressing the government to raise on-call allowances by 25 percent to $10 an hour paid in cash.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A small Indian non-profit funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies will not be allowed to carry out tobacco-control work in New Delhi after it failed to disclose its funding, according to a city government official and a memo seen by Reuters.
Other foreign-funded organizations will need to seek prior approval in the future for anti-tobacco activities in the Indian capital, the official also said.
The Delhi city government's decision comes amid similar moves by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's federal administration, which has since 2014 tightened surveillance of foreign-funded non-governmental organizations (NGOs), saying many of them work against India's national interests.
Thousands of charities' license have been canceled for misreporting donations in recent years. Reuters reported last year that India had discreetly investigated how Bloomberg Philanthropies, founded by billionaire Michael Bloomberg, funds local non-profit groups for anti-tobacco lobbying. (https://reut.rs/2gnoZzn)
In the latest case, a Bloomberg-backed NGO, Socio Economic and Educational Development Society (SEEDS), had approached the Delhi city government to collaborate on tobacco control but did not share its foreign funding details when asked, the city's chief tobacco control officer S.K. Arora told Reuters on Monday.
His decision not to allow SEEDS to carry out tobacco-control activities in the city is aimed at promoting funding transparency, Arora said, adding that he remained fully committed to tobacco control.
Arora said SEEDS had proposed advising the state government on tobacco-control policy matters.
The head of SEEDS, Deepak Mishra, said he had not received any order from the Delhi government. On reviewing the note shared by Reuters, he said SEEDS was working on tobacco control with two state governments and would discuss the issues with Arora. SEEDS has yet to start its work in Delhi and Mishra declined to disclose the funding he receives from Bloomberg.
A spokeswoman for Bloomberg Philanthropies, Jean Weinberg, did not respond to a request for comment.
An anti-tobacco activist in India, who did not wish to be named, said the Delhi government's decision would set a worrying precedent.
""This is sending a wrong message. They are basically deterring tobacco control,"" the activist said.
BROADER WARNING FOR DELHI
India's federal government has stepped up scrutiny of NGOs registered under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) in recent years. In 2015, it put the Ford Foundation on a watch list and suspended Greenpeace India's FCRA license, drawing criticism from the United States.
The FCRA license of at least one Bloomberg-funded group - the Institute of Public Health Bengaluru - has not been renewed in the last two years, in part due to the home ministry's investigation into the foundation's funding activities.
A 2016 note from the home ministry, which Reuters reviewed last year, said the Bloomberg charity successfully lobbied for the introduction of bigger health warnings on cigarette packs and raised concerns that the foundation was running a campaign to ""target"" Indian tobacco businesses.
The federal Indian health ministry, in contrast, has promoted tobacco-control, launching several campaigns to deter its use.
More than 900,000 people die each year in India due to tobacco-related illnesses.
The Delhi state government's latest order on the Bloomberg-backed SEEDS, issued on Nov. 20, also included a warning for other non-profits. The note has not previously been reported.
""These days, the government of India is very particular on international fundings & is investigating the actual objectives of various international funding agencies including Bloomberg,"" Arora wrote in his note, referring to the federal government.
All non-profits having international funding from Bloomberg or other sources are ""completely prohibited to execute any activity under tobacco control"" unless approved by the state government, the circular said.

ADEN/DUBAI (Reuters) - Yemeni Houthi officials are expected to travel to Sweden shortly for talks as early as Wednesday to end the nearly four-year-old war after the Saudi-led coalition allowed the evacuation of some of their wounded for treatment.
Prospects for convening talks have risen as Western allies press Saudi Arabia, leader of the Sunni Muslim alliance battling the Iranian-aligned Houthis, over a war that has killed more than 10,000 people and pushed Yemen to the brink of famine.
U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths arrived in the Houthi-held capital Sanaa on Monday to escort the Houthi delegation, a U.N. source told Reuters. The Saudi-backed government has said it would follow the Houthis to the talks, the first since 2016.
The peace talks may start on Wednesday, two sources familiar with the matter said. Griffiths shuttled between the parties to salvage a previous round that collapsed in September after the Houthis failed to show up.
Western powers, which provide arms and intelligence to the coalition, may now have greater leverage to demand action on Yemen after outrage over the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Riyadh's consulate in Istanbul led to increased scrutiny of the kingdom's activities in the region.
The U.S. Senate is due to consider this week a resolution to end support for the conflict, seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and its arch-foe in the Middle East, Iran.
Mohammed al-Bukhaiti, a member of the Houthi politburo, told Reuters their delegation would travel to Sweden Tuesday morning on a plane provided by Kuwait and accompanied by Griffiths.
A post on the U.N. envoy's Twitter account thanked all parties for facilitating the evacuation of the 50 wounded fighters on Monday to Oman for treatment.
British foreign minister Jeremy Hunt tweeted that the evacuation as a ""positive 1st step"" ahead of the talks.
The coalition said in a statement it had agreed on the evacuation ""for humanitarian considerations and as part of confidence-building measures"" ahead of the talks, which are also due to focus on a transitional governing body.
The Iranian Foreign Ministry said it backed the talks and was ready to help find a political solution, Iranian state TV reported on Monday.
LOOMING FAMINE
Analysts said both parties showing up for the talks would be an achievement in itself, even if there are no concrete outcomes as Griffiths tries to overcome deep mistrust on all sides.
""Neither side wishes to be blamed for the dire consequences of the looming famine, which is starting to become a reality,"" said Elisabeth Kendall, a senior research fellow in Arabic and Islamic Studies at Oxford University.
""But it remains to be seen whether the political will is really there to make the necessary concessions for peace.""
Some 8.4 million Yemenis are facing starvation, although the United Nations has warned that will probably rise to 14 million. Three-quarters of impoverished Yemen's population, or 22 million people, require aid.
The Arab alliance intervened in the war in 2015 to restore the internationally recognized government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi but has bogged down in military stalemate, despite superior air power, since seizing the southern port of Aden that year. 
The Houthis, who are more adept at guerrilla warfare, hold most population centers including Sanaa and the Red Sea port city of Hodeidah, a lifeline for millions that is now the focus of the war.

Griffiths hopes to reach a deal on reopening Sanaa airport and securing a prisoner swap and a ceasefire in Hodeidah as a foundation for a wider ceasefire, which would include a halt to coalition air strikes that have killed thousands of civilians as well as Houthi missile attacks on Saudi cities.

MADRID (Reuters) - Buoyant right-wingers and downcast Socialists agreed on one thing on Monday in Spain: politics will not be the same again after the surprise election in Andalusia's regional parliament of 12 far-right lawmakers.
Andalusia kicked off a busy electoral season on Sunday by delivering the Socialists an unexpected blow and handing over to the far-right Vox a regional kingmaker role long unthinkable in a country with memories of military dictatorship still acute.
With a spate of local, regional and European elections slated for May, parties jostled to take the lead in the changing landscape after the inconclusive outcome in Andalusia, where Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's Socialists could lose control. 
""This is just the beginning,"" Pablo Casado, the new, national leader of the conservative People's Party (PP), told a news conference. ""Spain has had enough."" 
Lessons from Andalusia's vote are that the far-right surge, an increasingly fragmented political scene, and deepening polarization, especially over matters of regional autonomy and immigration, are here to stay, analysts said.
""What happened on Sunday changes everything,"" said Narciso Michavila, head of GAD3 pollsters, who had forecast the election of Vox lawmakers but said the fact that as many as 12 got seats in Andalusia's assembly was an unexpected game-changer. 
Surveys show voters on both sides of the left-right divide used the Andalusia election to send Sanchez messages on national politics - ranging from his overtures to Catalan nationalists that some judge to be too lenient to a desire for snap general elections, according to Michavila.
A senior Socialist official from Andalusia concurred. Speaking on condition of anonymity, he blamed what he called the government's ""tepidness"" on Catalonia for keeping the party's voters at home in a region that is usually a party stronghold.
Sanchez has said he is open to a referendum on greater autonomy for Catalonia and has promised to lay out detailed plans in parliament on Dec. 12. Catalonian nationalists' bid for independence is a very divisive issue in Spain.
""DECISIVE""
""What happened here will be decisive for the rest of Spain,"" Vox leader Santiago Abascal told a news conference.
He projected fresh ambitions for a party that so far operated on the fringe of Spain's politics but benefited from fatigue with mainstream parties, fears for Spain's unity and about immigration. Andalusia has borne the brunt of a migrant wave from North Africa across the Strait of Gibraltar.
Vox's electoral success on Sunday was the first for the far-right since Spain's return to democracy in the late 1970s.
But the anti-immigration party, which opposes giving regions more power in what is already one of Europe's most decentralised country, can now target wins in more regions and municipalities when Spaniards go back to the polls in May 2019.
""I am convinced Vox can get people elected in all the municipalities and regions where it will present candidates,"" said Pablo Simon, a political science professor at Madrid's Carlos III University. ""Spain now has a multi-party system with a far right like other European countries.""
Government officials said the Andalusia election convinced them to stick to their policies rather than change them, and Sanchez insisted he would keep his party on a pro-Europe track.
An important question will be if, and when, Sanchez, who leads a minority government, could call early general elections, ahead of the 2020 scheduled date.
Vox Vice-President Victor Gonzalez told Reuters he was in no rush, as he was convinced his party was only starting to grow.
""If there are elections now we would have less seats than in 2020,"" he said.
There are still many unknowns, not the least of which being who will eventually govern Andalusia, with negotiations just starting. [L8N1Y81FG]

While a union of the right, with Vox backing the People's Party and the center-right Ciudadanos, seemed most likely, analysts said, an alliance with the far-right could complicate Ciudadanos' European ambitions.

The Saudi heir, Mohammed bin Salman, had arrived late on Sunday for a two-day visit to Algeria. He wished Bouteflika a speedy recovery, the presidency said in statement carried by the official APS news agency.
The cancellation of the meeting is likely to fuel speculation over whether Bouteflika will run for a fifth next in presidential elections next year.
Bouteflika, in office since 1999, has rarely appeared in public since suffering a stroke in 2013 which has bound him to a wheelchair. His last meeting with a senior foreign official was during a visit by German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Sept. 17. An earlier meeting with Merkel and a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte were canceled earlier this year.
The ruling party and trade unions have urged Bouteflika to run again, but intellectuals and the opposition have said his health makes him unfit for another term.
The Saudi heir met Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia, who had also received him at the airport.
Prince Mohammed was visiting Algeria as part of a tour of Arab countries he has resumed after attending the G20 summit in Argentina on the weekend.
The crown prince is on his first trip abroad since the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, which has strained Saudi Arabia's ties with the West and battered the prince's image abroad.
Saudi Arabia has said the prince had no prior knowledge of the murder. After offering numerous contradictory explanations, Riyadh said last month that Khashoggi had been killed and his body dismembered when negotiations to persuade him to return to Saudi Arabia failed.
So far during Prince Mohammed's tour of Arab states there has been little or no sign of discontent with his leadership of Saudi Arabia, with the exception of Tunisia, one of the few Arab democracies, where there were demonstrations against him.

In Algeria, opposition newspaper Liberte published rare criticism, running a cartoon showing a ghost telling the prince: ""This is Bouteflika"". The anxious heir responded: ""You frightened me. I had thought this was Khashoggi.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A human rights law group contracted by the U.S. State Department to investigate atrocities against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar called on Monday for the urgent establishment of a criminal tribunal to bring those responsible to justice.
There were reasonable grounds to believe the Myanmar military committed crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes against the minority group, the Washington-based Public International Law and Policy Group (PILPG) said in a report. The report was based on more than 1,000 interviews with Rohingya refugees who fled to Bangladesh.
The group's use of the term genocide adds pressure on President Donald Trump's administration to harden its own characterization of the treatment of the Rohingya, something that could oblige Washington to take stronger punitive measures against Myanmar.
""The international community is obliged to protect populations subjected to atrocity crimes by their own governments and ensure justice and accountability for such crimes,"" the report said.
It called for the urgent establishment of an ""accountability mechanism,"" or an immediate reference to the International Criminal Court. It noted that in similar circumstances in the past, different mechanisms had been used, including the ICC, ad hoc tribunals established by the U.N., and hybrid or domestic tribunals established with the support of intergovernmental organizations.
The military in Myanmar, where Buddhism is the main religion, has denied past accusations of genocide against the Rohingya Muslims and says its actions were part of a fight against terrorism. The Myanmar embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the PILPG report. 
A report by United Nations investigators in August found that Myanmar's military carried out mass killings and gang rapes of Rohingyas with ""genocidal intent"" and said the commander-in-chief and five generals should be prosecuted under international law.
That report called for the U.N. Security Council to impose an arms embargo, targeted sanctions and for the suspects to be tried by an ad hoc tribunal or referred to the ICC. However, diplomats say veto powers China and Russia are likely to protect Myanmar, also known as Burma, from U.N. action.
The PILPG's interviews with refugees formed the basis of a U.S. State Department report released in September, but the U.S. government stopped short of using the terms crimes against humanity, genocide or war crimes. The PILPG's report on Monday added the group's legal analysis to its findings on the atrocities. 
The State Department report, the subject of internal debate that delayed its rollout for nearly a month, referred to a ""well-planned and coordinated"" campaign of mass killings, gang rapes and other atrocities.
A declaration of genocide by the U.S. government, which has only gone as far as labeling the crackdown ""ethnic cleansing,"" could have legal implications that may commit Washington to stronger punitive measures against Myanmar. This has made some in the Trump administration wary of issuing such an assessment.
Asked about the PILPG report, a State Department spokesperson noted the designation ethnic cleansing that Washington has used so far, and said the U.S. government ""continues to review and analyze new evidence and information as it comes to light.""
More than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims fled a sweeping army crackdown in Rakhine State last year, according to U.N. agencies. Human rights groups and Rohingya activists have put the death toll in the thousands from the crackdown.
SENATORS CRITICAL OF U.S. STANCE
U.S. senators from both sides of the aisle have criticized Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for not going further in his condemnation.
""The State Department had access to the exact same data when developing its report, yet we don’t have any policy announcement from Secretary Pompeo on a genocide determination, nor any other public statement on how the administration views the brutality. What is the reason for this silence?"" Democratic Senator Ed Markey said in a statement to Reuters. 
Republican Senator Marco Rubio called last week for an immediate determination of genocide.
The lawyers' report, based on the work of 18 investigators from 11 countries, found that Rohingya men, women, and children were the victims of ""mass shootings and aerial bombardments, gang rapes and severe beatings, torture and burning, and attacks from flamethrowers and grenade launchers.""
It focused on the build-up to and conduct of ""major systematic attacks"" in Rakhine State between Aug. 25 and Sept. 4 last year.
Even as the Rohingya fled their villages for Bangladesh they were fired on by military helicopters while the Myanmar Navy sought to sink overcrowded ferries, the report said, adding this showed the campaign went beyond the aim of merely driving the people out.

""The scale and severity of the attacks and abuses ... suggest that, in the minds of the perpetrators, the goal was not just to expel, but also to exterminate the Rohingya,"" the report said.

Bush will hold a brief ceremony on Monday morning at a Texas Air National Guard base outside Houston, putting his casket onto Air Force One for a final trip to Washington.
Two of his sons, former President George W. Bush and Neil Bush, will accompany the body of the 41st president on the presidential jet, called ""Special Air Mission 41,"" for the flight to Joint Base Andrews outside of Washington.
Bush will lie in state at the U.S. Capitol Rotunda from Monday through Wednesday, when a state funeral is scheduled at the National Cathedral. 
A contingent of former Bush staff members now living in Texas will join the mourners leaving Houston on Monday morning, former Ambassador Chase Untermeyer told Houston Public Media.
The 41st president of the United States died at his Houston home on Friday night, seven months after his wife Barbara died. After services in Washington, there will be another funeral in Houston on Thursday followed by burial at the Bush Presidential Library in College Station, Texas.
Bush served two terms as vice president under fellow Republican President Ronald Reagan before his own stint in the Oval Office from 1989 to 1993, a time that saw the end of the Cold War as well as the United States' routing of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's army in the 1991 Gulf War.
He failed to win a second term after breaking a no-new-taxes pledge.
Trump has ordered the federal government to close on Wednesday and both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq will be closed on Wednesday in observance. 
Remembrances to George and Barbara Bush sprang up in the neighborhood where he made his home, at a memorial to President Bush at a city park and at the airport named in his honor.
Christy Smith paused over the weekend to pay her respects to President Bush at a bronze statue of him at a Houston park.

""He set a good example for all of us,"" said Smith, 39. ""He always was caring and treated people equally.""

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - A Swedish appeals court on Monday found Jean-Claude Arnault, the man at the center of a sex scandal that forced the postponement of this year's Nobel Prize in Literature, guilty of an additional rape and increased his prison term. 
A lower court in October had convicted Arnault, who is married to Swedish Academy member Katarina Frostenson, of one rape but acquitted him of another. The lower court verdict was appealed by both the prosecutor and the defense. 
The appeals court convicted him of both rapes of the woman in question in an unanimous decision and lengthened his prison sentence by six months to 2-1/2 years. Arnault had denied all charges. 
""My client is very grateful and very relieved about the verdict from the Court of Appeals. This vindication also means that my client can finally move on with her life,"" Elisabeth Massi Fritz, the woman's lawyer, told TT news agency.
Arnault's lawyer said the verdict would be appealed to the Supreme Court. 
Arnault, a photographer and well-known cultural figure in Sweden, was accused of sexual misconduct by 18 women in a newspaper article in November last year. All but one of the women's allegations were dropped due to a lack of evidence or because the statute of limitations had passed.
In an internal investigation initiated by the Academy he was also alleged to have leaked the closely-guarded names of Nobel prize winners on seven different occasions.
Arnault denied all charges, including that of being the source of leaks.
The accusations against him caused a feud among members of the academy, which picks winners for the Nobel Prize in Literature, and evolved into its biggest crisis since it was founded by King Gustav III more than 200 years ago. 

The Nobel Foundation, which controls the prize money donated by Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, has warned it could drop the Swedish Academy from awarding the prestigious prize if it does not make further changes in response to the scandal.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican expressed concern over the status of Jerusalem on Monday as Pope Francis and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas held their first meeting since the United States stirred international anxiety by moving its embassy there.
The two embraced and kissed on the cheek as the pontiff welcomed Abbas to a library in the Vatican's Apostolic Palace for a private, 20-minute meeting.
""Particular attention was reserved for the status of Jerusalem, underlining the importance of recognizing and preserving its identity and the universal value of the holy City for the three Abrahamic religions,"" a Vatican statement said, referring to Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. 
U.S. President Donald Trump outraged the Arab world last year when he reversed decades of policy by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and put Washington's embassy there. It was opened in May.
Palestinians, with broad international backing, want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future independent state, while Israel views the whole city its ""united and eternal"" capital.
The Vatican expressed concern last year at Trump's move, saying the city's ""status quo"" should be respected. Francis has called for all to honor U.N. resolutions on the city. 
The official Palestinian news agency WAFA said Abbas briefed the pope on ""the implications of the U.S. decision"".
As Abbas was leaving the library, he told the pope: ""We are counting on you"". It was not clear what he was referring to.
The Vatican backs a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, with both sides agreeing on the status of Jerusalem as part of the peace process. 
The statement said Abbas and the pope also discussed efforts to reactivate the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and hoped for ""a renewed commitment on the part of the international community to meet the legitimate aspirations of both peoples"".

They also urged an end to ""extremism and fundamentalism"" in the Middle East, and called for reconciliation among Palestinian factions. Abbas' Fatah party is dominant in the West Bank, while the Islamist group Hamas controls Gaza.

KATOWICE, Poland,(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is ""out on a limb"" in his attitude to climate change as nearly every other government, as well as an angry younger generation, are demanding action, British naturalist David Attenborough said on Monday at U.N. climate talks in Poland.
The 92-year-old, whose TV series ""Blue Planet II"" was avidly watched as far away as China, has been credited with raising awareness of rampant plastic pollution in the oceans. He was speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of the most important U.N. climate conference since 2015.
That year saw the signing of the Paris accord, a U.N.-sponsored deal to agree where the limits of global warming should be set, principally through a radical reduction in the use of fossil fuels. Two weeks of talks in Katowice aim to hammer out details of how that will be achieved.
Asked about Trump's decision to abandon the U.N. process, Attenborough said the United States was ""out on a limb"".
""I can only hope that, for whatever reason, whatever mechanism, that will change in the United States,"" he said.
""It shouldn't affect us and the whole of the rest of the world,"" he said, adding that everyone else was ""absolutely clear"" on the need for action.
Trump last week dismissed projections in a report from his own government that climate change will cause severe economic harm to the U.S. economy.
Attenborough, who has been broadcasting on the natural world since the 1950s, was on Monday the first holder of the ""People's Seat"" at the U.N. table.
Climate advocates and citizens with views on or experience of climate change were encouraged to use the social media hashtag #TakeYourSeat to feed comments into his opening-day address, and influence the global debate.
The broadcaster said U.N. conferences could seem remote, and the hashtag provided ""a way in which people can get their feelings across to those who are taking decisions on their behalf"".
He said he believed he had been chosen to launch the role because of his long experience of broadcasting, during which he has witnessed devastating change.
In particular, he mentioned coral reefs.
""If you're a naturalist or if you're not a naturalist, they are the most stunning things in the natural world,"" he said.
""It's a most magical manifestation of life ... and you go to a reef which has been bleached, and it's gone. All you see is that the coral is dead.""
But now the young were demanding change.
""We have all been living beyond our means. It's a perfectly simple thing. We knew not what we did,"" he said.

""We have let down the young generation, and they know it, and they are angry.""

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - The Central European University, founded by billionaire George Soros, said on Monday it had been forced out of Hungary in ""an arbitrary eviction"" that violated academic freedom, and it confirmed plans to open a new campus in Austria.
CEU's statement is the culmination of a years-long struggle between Hungarian-born but U.S.-based Soros, who promotes liberal causes through his charities, and the nationalist, anti-immigrant government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban. 
For nearly three decades CEU has been a gateway to the West for thousands of students from ex-communist eastern Europe, offering U.S.-accredited degree programs in an academic climate that celebrates free thought.
The university said it would leave Budapest if it had not secured guarantees of academic freedom by Dec. 1.
""CEU has been forced out,"" said CEU President and Rector Michael Ignatieff in a statement. ""This is unprecedented. A U.S. institution has been driven out of a country that is a NATO ally. A European institution has been ousted from a member state of the EU.""
""Arbitrary eviction of a reputable university is a flagrant violation of academic freedom. It is a dark day for Europe and a dark day for Hungary,"" CEU's statement added.
Ignatieff told a news conference later that the CEU had received a ""clear and unequivocal"" welcome in Austria.
The United States said it was ""disappointed"" that CEU was unable to remain in Hungary.
""The departure of these U.S.-accredited programs from Hungary will be a loss for the CEU community, for the United States, and for Hungary,"" Heather Nauert, spokesperson for the State Department, said in a statement.
LONG BATTLE
CEU's legal status has been in limbo for more than a year since changes to a higher education law that meant a foreign-registered university could no longer operate in Hungary unless it also provided courses in its home country.
Orban's critics say the legal changes deliberately targeted CEU, which is regularly ranked as the top university in Hungary. Orban accuses Soros of encouraging mass immigration into Europe, a charge the philanthropist denies.
The European Commission has taken Hungary to court over the higher education law and has clashed with Orban over other issues related to the rule of law and democratic standards.
Earlier this year, Open Society Foundations, Soros' main funding network, was also forced to leave Hungary.
CEU, founded in Budapest in 1991, has repeatedly said it has complied with all the new regulations set by Orban's government, which has refused to sign off on an already agreed document with the State of New York that would allow CEU to stay.
Hungary's government has dismissed the university's move as a ""Soros-style bluff"".
CEU said it would start enrolling students for U.S. degrees at its new campus in Vienna for the next academic year. Students already enrolled will complete their studies in Budapest.
The university retains accreditation as a Hungarian university and will seek to continue teaching and research activity in Budapest as long as possible, it said.

Hungarians comprise about 20 percent of the 1,320 students admitted to CEU for the 2018-19 academic year. Many others are from central and eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union and western Europe, with smaller numbers from further afield.

Guedes was to speak with investors in London. He also planned to be in Madrid this week with incoming Justice Minister Sergio Moro for a panel hosted by writer Mario Vargas Llosa on the challenges facing governments in Latin America.
Guedes, a long-time investment banker, is the economic guru for far-right President-elect Jair Bolsonaro, who he helped win credibility with Brazil's business class on his way to being elected in October. 
Last week, Brazil's federal police, who will be under the command of Moro's justice ministry, began an investigation into Guedes for alleged fraud tied to pension funds at state-firms.
Police will look into whether Guedes mismanaged hundreds of millions of reais that public pension funds put in his investment vehicles starting in 2009.

LIMA (Reuters) - Uruguay has rejected a request for asylum from former Peruvian President Alan Garcia, who is currently under investigation in his home country on allegations of corruption, Peruvian Foreign Minister Néstor Popolizo said on Monday.
Uruguayan officials notified Peru of the decision and said Garcia, 69, had left Uruguay's embassy in Lima after about two weeks there.
""They conducted an evaluation of the situation and came to the conclusion that this was not a case of political persecution,"" Popolizo told local radio broadcaster RPP.
Garcia, who was Peru's president from 1985 to 1990 and again from 2006 to 2011, requested asylum at Uruguay's embassy shortly after a judge last month barred him from leaving Peru for 18 months while under investigation for allegedly receiving bribes during the construction of an electric train in Lima by Brazilian company Odebrecht.
The prosecutor in the case, Jose Perez, has also accused Garcia of receiving $100,000 for taking part in a conference in Brazil, and said the money likely came from an Odebrecht fund used to pay bribes in several Latin American countries.
The sweeping Odebrecht corruption scandal has implicated dozens of high-ranking officials across Latin America, who have been accused of taking bribes in exchange for public works contracts.

In 1992, Garcia applied for asylum in the Colombian embassy in Lima while he was being investigated for corruption and illicit enrichment.

DHAKA (Reuters) - An alliance of opposition parties accused Bangladesh's Election Commission (EC) on Monday of being biased in favor of the ruling Awami League Party after it rejected nearly a quarter of the candidates the alliance nominated for elections on Dec. 30.
The EC has rejected 205 of a total 900 nominations made by the Jatiya Oikya Front, or United National Front, a multi-party opposition alliance, said S. Farazi, press secretary of one of the parties.
""The EC has played a biased role in cancelling nominations, as almost no nominations from the ruling party were rejected,"" said Mahmudur Rahman Manna, convener of Nagarik Oikya, a partner in the alliance that seeks to oust Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her Awami League from power.
Manna said the alliance planned to challenge the rejections in court. ""Though we know we will not gain anything, we will not bow down to this injustice without a challenge,"" he said. 
The EC denied the charge of bias, saying that of a total 3,065 nominations received, 786 had been rejected for various reasons, including non-payment of loans or utility bills and criminal convictions.
Helal Uddin Ahmed, secretary of the EC, said it ""had not yet classified numbers based on their political affiliations"".
Four sources familiar with the matter said dozens of rejected nominations were of breakaway elements from the Awami League who had failed to secure party nominations. 
Mahbubul Alam Hanif, senior joint general secretary of the Awami League, said only five or six of its nominations had been rejected. 
AUTHORITARIAN RULE
While Hasina's government has won widespread global plaudits for letting in hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees who fled persecution in Myanmar, its critics have decried Hasina's increasingly authoritarian rule, the government's handling of student protests this year and its crackdown on free speech.
The alliance of opposition parties had asked for a caretaker government to take over in the weeks heading into the elections. The Awami League rejected the demand, however, deeming it unconstitutional.
The main opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), had similarly pressed for a caretaker government during the 2014 election and boycotted it after its demand was not met.
The BNP remains in disarray after the jailing of its head, former prime minister Khaleda Zia, on corruption charges.
Hasina and Khaleda, who between them have ruled Bangladesh for decades, are bitter rivals and the BNP says its leader has been jailed on trumped-up charges to keep her out of politics.
Nomination papers filed on behalf of Khaleda have also been rejected by the EC. 
The BNP filed the nomination papers on Khaleda's behalf despite a ruling last month that she would not be allowed to contest this month's election.

MIT NAMA (Reuters) - When Houaida Mabrouk heard about a government campaign that offers free hepatitis C screenings, she hesitated, afraid of testing positive. But after many from her community started visiting health clinics to get checked, she changed her mind. 
""I thought, 'I should go too',"" Mabrouk said, speaking at a clinic in the Mit Nama village near Cairo before learning she did not have the virus. 
Egypt, which has the highest rate of hepatitis C in the world, is carrying out an unprecedented campaign to detect and treat the disease in a bid to eliminate it by 2022. It aims to test the entire adult population -- about 50 million people.
Nearly 4.4 percent of adult Egyptians are infected and about 40,000 die of the disease every year, making it the country's third leading cause of death, according to the World Bank. 
The campaign, which runs from October to April, also tests for diabetes and high blood pressure. 
""They are eliminating Egypt's two biggest health problems: Virus C and all the danger factors including the basic non-communicable diseases,"" said Jean Jabbour, the World Health Organization's representative in Egypt. 
Hepatitis C is a liver disease caused by a blood-borne virus. Most cases can be cured with antiviral medicine, but many do not initially show symptoms. If left untreated the virus can cause cirrhosis or liver cancer. 
In Egypt, many were infected decades ago when poorly sterilized needles were used as part of a national treatment campaign against schistosomiasis, a disease caused by parasitic worms. 
Most donated blood is still not effectively screened, according to a recent World Bank report. 
At least 11.5 million people have been screened in the new campaign, with 5 percent testing positive. 
Large banners bearing health information and a picture of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi appeared in many Cairo streets as the campaign came to the capital on Saturday. 
The campaign, which also treats those infected for free, is mainly funded by the World Bank. The bank has provided $133 million for the tests and $129 million for the treatment, according to a cabinet statement. 
Due to lack of health clinics, some churches, mosques and youth centers also offer the blood test. 
A church in the village of Begam, which like the Mit Nama village is in the Qalyubia province north of Cairo, serves as a health clinic every Sunday.
""This initiative should have taken place much, much earlier, but it is good that the president thought of it now,"" said Ashyaa Abd al-Sayed, pastor at the church.
Unless the population is tested and treated in a single campaign, the disease won't be eliminated, said Health Minister Hala Zayed.
""If you only test and treat parts of the population... then those who weren't treated might infect others,"" she said.
Globally, an estimated 71 million people suffer chronically from hepatitis C.

KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - British broadcaster and environmentalist David Attenborough on Monday urged world leaders, meeting in Poland to agree ways to limit global warming, to get on and tackle ""our greatest threat in thousands of years"".
Known for countless nature films, Attenborough has gained prominence recently with his ""Blue Planet II"" series, which highlighted the devastating effect of pollution on the oceans.
""Leaders of the world, you must lead,"" said the naturalist, given a ""People's seat"" at the two-week U.N. climate conference in the Polish coal city of Katowice alongside two dozen heads of state and government.
""The continuation of our civilisations and the natural world upon which we depend, is in your hands,"" he said.
The world is currently on course to overshoot by far the limits for global warming agreed in the landmark 2015 Paris accord on climate change, which were intended to prevent more extreme weather, rising sea levels and the loss of plant and animal species.
The Katowice talks are billed as the most important U.N. conference since Paris, coming ahead of an end-of-year deadline to agree a ""rule book"" on enforcing action.
Yet political and U.N. leaders have been struggling to inject urgency into two weeks of haggling on how to move on from fossil fuels to give practical effect to the Paris accord.
Representatives of some of the most powerful countries and biggest polluters were conspicuous by their absence, and the United States is quitting the U.N. climate process.
To maximise the chances of success in Poland, technical talks began on Sunday, a day early, with delegates from nearly 200 nations debating how to meet the Paris target of limiting global warming to between 1.5 and 2.0 degrees Celsius (2.7 and 3.6 Fahrenheit). 
""WAVE OF OPTIMISM HAS BROKEN""
Michal Kurtyka, Poland's deputy environment minister and president of the talks, said that without success in Katowice, Paris would not be a success, as it had only decided what was needed, not how it could be done.
Moreover, the wider political environment had changed.
""The wave of optimism and global cooperation that carried us to and through Paris has now crested, broken and is now tumbling,"" he told delegates.
He nevertheless took heart from a G20 statement at the weekend when the leading industrialised nations - except the United States - reaffirmed their commitment to implementing the Paris deal.
A series of reports in the run-up to the Katowice conference have made clear the widening gap between high-level rhetoric and actual work to cut emissions, which have continued to rise.
""It is hard to overstate the urgency of our situation,"" U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said.
""Climate change is running faster than we are and we must catch up sooner rather than later before it is too late.""
Attenborough told the delegates: ""Right now, we are facing a man-made disaster of global scale. Our greatest threat in thousands of years. Climate Change.""
Yet expectations for Katowice are low.
The host nation Poland is committed to coal, the most polluting of fossil fuels. It is calling for a ""just transition"" to provide help for communities dependent on fossil fuels.
Riots in Paris at the weekend, partly in protest at fuel taxes, also illustrate the conundrum: how do politicians introduce long-term environmental policies without inflicting costs on voters that may damage their chances of re-election?
To contain warming at 1.5C, man-made global net carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions will need to fall by about 45 percent by 2030 from 2010 levels and reach ""net zero"" by mid-century, according to the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
Delegates at the talks said sticking points were likely to include finance and the level of scrutiny associated with monitoring individual nations' emissions.

The U.N. has a goal of raising $100 billion every year from 2020 for climate action. To inject momentum, the World Bank Group on Monday said it would provide a further $200 billion over five years from the start of the next decade.

PRAGUE (Reuters) - Russia's intelligence services were behind cyber attacks targeting the Czech foreign ministry last year, the Czech security service said on Monday in its annual report.
The BIS counter-intelligence service has long warned against Russian activity in the Czech Republic, a member of NATO since 1999 and of the European Union since 2004. Many other Western countries have issued similar warnings.
In its report, BIS said two separate attacks on the Czech foreign ministry were partly the work of the APT28 hacking group, which is linked to the Russian government and has been blamed for past attacks in Germany and the United States.
""All the findings make clear that it was the Turla cyberespionage campaign, originating from the FSB, a Russian intelligence service, and APT28/Sofacy, which is credited to the Russian military intelligence, the GRU,"" the annual report said.
In a hack of the ministry's information system, it said, attackers accessed more than 150 staff mailboxes, copying emails and attachments. ""They thus obtained data that may be used for future attacks, as well as a list of potential targets in virtually all the important state institutions,"" it said.
The Czech foreign ministry said at the time it believed a foreign state was behind the cyber attacks on it but said no confidential material was compromised.
As in previous years, the report warned of Russia's continued use of undeclared intelligence officers acting under diplomatic cover as part of a general hybrid strategy against member states of the European Union and NATO.
The Russian government was not immediately available on Monday to comment on the BIS accusations. 
BIS also reported increased activity by Chinese intelligence officers and a growing worry of espionage in the economic, scientific and technical domains. 
Czech President Milos Zeman has vigorously promoted political and business ties with both China and Russia.
BIS said it had also detected several attacks against Czech military targets, with the most serious compromising several private email accounts of people linked to the Defence Ministry and army and also compromising an IP address by malware know as X-Agent.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan said on Monday U.S. President Donald Trump has sought its help with faltering Afghan peace talks, part of intensifying efforts by Trump to end one of America's longest wars.
Trump, in a letter to new Prime Minister Imran Khan, asked for Pakistan's ""support and facilitation"" in negotiating an end to the war and offered to renew the strained relationship, Pakistan's foreign ministry said.
The overture to Khan represents a sea change from Trump's normally harsh rhetoric towards Pakistan, and will add to growing speculation that the United States is planning to pull out of Afghanistan in the near future.
The U.S. president wants to bring to a close the 17-year-old conflict between Afghan security forces and the Taliban, who are fighting to drive out international forces and reestablish their version of strict Islamic law after their 2001 ouster.
U.S. officials have long been pushing Pakistan to lean on Taliban leaders, who Washington says are based inside Pakistan, to bring them to the negotiating table.
""He has asked for Pakistan's cooperation to bring the Taliban into talks,"" Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry told Reuters.
Trump told Khan the Pakistan relationship was very important to the United States and to finding a solution to the Afghanistan conflict, Chaudhry added.
The U.S. embassy in Islamabad had no immediate comment on the letter.
Trump has been open about his desire to bring home about 14,000 U.S. troops who remain in Afghanistan as part of Resolute Support and a separate counter-terrorism mission aimed against militant groups such as al Qaeda and Islamic State.
""President Trump has also acknowledged that the war had cost both USA and Pakistan. He has emphasized that Pakistan and USA should explore opportunities to work together and renew partnership,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement.
The ministry added that Pakistan is committed to playing ""a facilitation role in good faith"".
""Peace and stability in Afghanistan remain a shared responsibility.""
UNEASY ALLIES
Trump has appointed Afghan-born U.S. diplomat Zalmay Khalilzad as a special envoy for Afghanistan, tasking him with pushing through peace talks.
Khalilzad last month set a deadline of April 2019 for the war to end. But Afghan Taliban militants last month rejected the proposed deadline and said a three-day meeting in Qatar between their leaders and Khalilzad, to pave the way for peace talks, ended with no agreement.
Khalilzad on Sunday began an eight-country tour, which includes Pakistan, Russia and Qatar, to promote peace and convince the Taliban to join negotiations.
Officially allies in fighting terrorism, Pakistan and the United States have a complicated relationship, bound by Washington’s dependence on Pakistan to supply its troops in Afghanistan but plagued by accusations Islamabad is playing a double game.
Last month, Trump said in an interview Pakistan doesn't ""do a damn thing"" for the United States despite billions of dollars in U.S. aid, adding that Pakistani officials knew of former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden's location before his killing by U.S. troops in a 2011 raid inside Pakistan.
Khan hit back by saying the United States should not blame Pakistan for its failings in Afghanistan.
Pakistani officials, who deny offering safe havens to the Afghan Taliban, say their influence on the group has waned over the years. 
Last week, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said he had formed a 12-strong team to negotiate peace with the Taliban, but warned that implementation of any deal would take at least five years.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa faces more power cuts, electricity utility Eskom warned on Monday as it sought to prevent the collapse of its power grid in a test for President Cyril Ramaphosa's reforms.
Eskom implemented a fifth day of controlled power cuts on Monday, putting more strain on an economy already mired in recession only months before a national election.
""The entire week could be severely constrained if we are unable to replenish the diesel and water reserves, and reduce the high unplanned outages,"" Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe said.
Eskom, which is battling a severe financial crisis, coal shortages and breakdowns of its power plants, said it would cut up to 2,000 megawatts of power from the grid on Monday.
The utility, which last week called for a bailout or debt relief, began the controlled cuts, known as load-shedding, on Thursday as demand for power outstripped available capacity.
""Eskom teams are working hard to salvage the situation but the process is going to be hard, long and costly,"" Phasiwe said.
Ramaphosa has made reforming Eskom a priority, but he has been hampered by fiscal constraints in a blow to his plan to woo investors who can help grow the economy ahead of an election likely to be held in May next year. nL8N1X61GL]
""Eskom as an institution and its ability to provide stable power supply is the single biggest risk to @CyrilRamaphosa's investment drive and the South Africa fiscus,"" Isaah Mhlanga, executive chief economist at Alexander Forbes Investments said on Twitter.
 BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) South Africa senior economist Jeff Schultz said prolonged power cuts would likely hurt economic growth in the first quarter of 2019, although a slowdown in manufacturing over the Christmas period will buy Eskom some time. 
""But come mid-January, if we are still facing load-shedding, that is when it is going to be a much more pressing issue for the economy,"" Schultz said.
South Africa entered recession in the second quarter for the first time since 2009. Third-quarter gross domestic product numbers are due out on Tuesday, with analysts polled by Reuters predicting quarter-on-quarter GDP growth of 1.6 percent.

PARIS (Reuters) - France's prime minister met with opposition leaders on Monday as President Emmanuel Macron sought a way to defuse nationwide protests over high living costs that led to widespread rioting in Paris at the weekend and are hurting the economy.
The ""yellow vest"" revolt caught Macron unawares when it erupted on Nov. 17 and poses a formidable challenge to the 40-year-old as he tries to counter a plunge in popularity over his economic reforms, which are seen as favoring the wealthy.
Riot police were overrun on Saturday as protesters wrought havoc in Paris's fanciest neighborhoods, torching dozens of cars, looting boutiques and smashing up luxury private homes and cafes in the worst disturbances the capital has seen since 1968.
The unrest is hitting the economy: hotel reservations are down, retailers are suffering, unsettling investors, and Total said some of its filling stations were running dry. 
Tourism and transport stocks fell in an otherwise buoyant market.
Emerging from Prime Minister Edouard Philippe's office, opposition leader Laurent Wauquiez of the centre-right Les Republicains said the government failed to understand the depth of public anger.
""The only outcome from this meeting was word of a debate in parliament,"" Wauquiez told reporters. ""What we need are gestures that appease, and these must be born out of the one decision every Frenchman is waiting for: scrapping (fuel) tax hikes."" 
SQUEEZE ON LIVING COSTS
The ""yellow vest"" movement, whose supporters cut across age, job profile and geographical region, began online as an impromptu rebellion against higher fuel prices but has morphed into a broader outpouring of anger over the squeeze that living costs are putting on middle-class household budgets. 
The movement's members come principally from the hard-pressed middle class and blue-collar workers living outside the big cities, but it also has more radical fringe elements. It has no clear leadership, making talks all the more complicated for the government.
Their core demand is a freeze on further planned fuel tax increases -- the next is due in January -- and measures to bolster spending power. But they have also called for Macron to go, and many talk up the idea of revolution.
The government is struggling for a way to engage. 
""Making a small gesture and then sweeping the problem under the carpet, just as has always been done for the last 30 years, does nothing to solve the deeper, structural problems,"" government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux told France Inter radio.
Public support for the ""yellow vests"" remains high, with seven in 10 people backing their protest, a Harris Interactive opinion poll conducted after Saturday's unrest suggested.
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Macron says the fuel tax increases are part of his effort to combat climate change, wanting to persuade French drivers to exchange diesel-fuelled cars for less polluting models. He said on Saturday he would not deviate from his policy goals.
As governments from around the world began a two-week conference in Poland to try to pin down measures to avert the most damaging consequences of global warming, the protests highlighted how costly some of those actions are likely to be.
Christophe Chalencon, one of around eight semi-official spokespeople for the ""yellow vests"", told BFM TV he would not enter talks only to ""negotiate over peanuts"".
The hitherto uncompromising response of Macron, a former investment banker, has only reinforced a view among the hard-pressed middle-class and blue-collar workers that he is part of an urban elite contemptuous of their world.
The anti-establishment anger spurring the yellow vests on could spell trouble for Macron in next year's European elections. These are traditionally fertile ground for the far-right, led by Marine Le Pen, which already leads surveys of voting intentions.

Saturday's unrest was the worst in central Paris since a student uprising five decades ago. At times, riot police appeared overwhelmed. The Arc de Triomphe, a unifying national monument that houses the tomb of the unknown soldier, was defaced, and a bust of national symbol Marianne was smashed.

ST ANDREWS, Scotland (Reuters) - The chief of Britain's foreign intelligence service warned the Kremlin on Monday not to underestimate the West after a brazen nerve agent attack on a retired double agent in England stoked fears about Russian covert activity abroad.
In his second major speech since being named in 2014 to head the Secret Intelligence Service, or MI6, Alex Younger said Russia has a stance of ""perpetual confrontation"" with the West.
After the attack on Sergei Skripal, a former Russian military intelligence officer who betrayed dozens of agents to MI6, Britain's allies in Europe and the United States took its side and ordered the biggest expulsion of Russian diplomats since the height of the Cold War.
Britain identified the nerve agent deployed in the English town of Salisbury as Novichok, a highly potent group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet military in the 1970s and 1980s.
""The Russian state used a military-grade chemical weapon on UK soil,"" Younger told students at the University of St Andrews in Scotland where he once studied economics and computer science before joining the British army.
""Our intention is for the Russian state to conclude that, whatever the benefits it thinks it is accruing from this activity, they are not worth the risk,"" he said. 
Moscow has repeatedly denied involvement and accused British intelligence agencies of staging the attack to stoke anti-Russian hysteria.
""I should emphasize that even as the Russian state seeks to destabilize us, we do not seek to destabilize Russia. We do not seek escalation,"" Younger said.
Younger, 55, said that Britain's spies have thwarted multiple Islamic State plots originating overseas.
Less than four months before the United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union on March 29, Younger said MI6 continues to work with partner agencies to strengthen ""indispensable security ties"" in Europe.
He said the United Kingdom had helped France and Germany prevent terrorist attacks.
MI6, the home of fictional spies such as John le Carré’s George Smiley and Ian Fleming’s James Bond, has the job of defending Britain, and its interests, abroad. 
A career spy who joined MI6 as the Soviet Union was crumbling, Younger stressed the need for espionage to embrace the new.
""The era of the fourth industrial revolution calls for a fourth-generation espionage: fusing our traditional human skills with accelerated innovation, new partnerships and a mindset that mobilizes diversity and empowers the young,"" he said.
In a recruitment pitch, Younger gave some details of his own life, including drinking obscure homemade alcohol in an attempt to penetrate an organization intent on genocide in the Western Balkans in 1990s.

""If you want to make a difference and you think you might have what it takes, then the chances are that you do have what it takes, and we hope you will step forward.""

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the war in Syria, said Israel carried out a missile attack in the area last Thursday evening. Israel has not said whether it conducted the attack and Syrian state media did not identify who carried it out.
Iran and the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah are major players in the war in Syria and their influence has alarmed Israel, which has repeatedly launched attacks on what it describes as Iranian and Iran-backed targets in the country.
Syrian state media said the country's air defenses had thwarted an attack last Thursday by ""hostile targets"" in the Kiswah area, without identifying them.
""Iranian and Hezbollah positions in Kiswah, southern Syria, were not exposed to any bombardment,"" the senior Hezbollah source told Reuters.
A Syrian army defector said at the time of the reported attack that the targets struck included two Syrian army brigades where Hezbollah is embedded.
According to two senior regional intelligence sources, the area where the incident is said to have occurred is where Hezbollah has its communications and logistics hub for southern Syria near the Israeli border. 
In September, a senior Israeli official said his country had carried out more than 200 attacks against Iranian targets in Syria in the last two years.
According to regional sources, Israel began carrying out military strikes in Syria in 2013 against suspected arms transfers and deployments by Iranian forces and Hezbollah.
A Syrian opposition figure familiar with the area said at the time of last week's reported attack that Israel had targeted the area because Syrian army barracks there had become a recruitment hub for Iran-backed forces.

The new rules require a two-thirds majority to change an elected leader, promising greater leadership stability after Australia's revolving door of five prime ministers in little more than five years.
""It has been to the great anguish of the Australian people, as they have seen this happen in the Labor and the Liberal party,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison told the media in Canberra, the capital.
""And they’re sick of it...and it has to stop."" 
The new rules will apply to leaders who successfully contest an election, Morrison added, thus opening the door to a challenge for the party's top job if the ruling Liberal-National coalition loses next year.
The coalition is staring down the barrel of a heavy election defeat in the next six months following backlash from voters over yet another leadership spill, in August, when then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull stepped down.
Monday's move followed Morrison's return from a meeting of the G20 grouping in Argentina, where Germany's Chancellor Merkel was photographed reading briefing notes on Morrison, who also talked President Trump through the process of a political spill. 
In 2013, Australia's Labor party reformed its leadership rules under Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, adopting rules that required 75 percent of the party room to agree before a change in the elected leader.

Since then, opposition leader Bill Shorten has been unchallenged as leader of the Labor party.

""Earlier today, coalition air forces conducted precision strikes against a number of ISIS leaders in southeast Syria. Those targeted included Abu al-Umarayn,"" Brett McGurk said in a Tweet late on Sunday. 
Abu al-Umarayn was responsible for killing several prisoners including the U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig, who was captured by the group in Syria and beheaded in 2014, McGurk said. 
The strike in the Badia desert in eastern Syria killed ""several other ISIS members"", said Colonel Sean Ryan, spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State. 
Abu al-Umarayn ""had given indications of posing an imminent threat to coalition forces,"" Ryan said. 
Late on Sunday, Syrian state media reported that the United States had fired missiles at Syrian government positions in the desert in eastern Syria. Ryan said the coalition did not fire at any Syrian forces. 
Islamic State has lost almost all the territory in Iraq and Syria where it once declared a caliphate, including its two main cities of Mosul and Raqqa last year.
The U.S.-led coalition is supporting a group of Kurdish and Arab militias assaulting the last Islamic State territory in eastern Syria near the Iraqi border. 
The Syrian army last month said it had completed its own operation against an Islamic State pocket in southern Syria.

178,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2018 06:05AM ET</span>",African migrants turn to deadly ocean route as options narrow,"By Edward McAllister and Alessandra Prentice
DAKAR (Reuters) - Assane Diallo is making final preparations for a journey he knows could cost him his life: one thousand miles across open ocean from Senegal to the Canary Islands in a 50-foot wooden boat held together with rusty nails. 
The 35-year-old fisherman hopes to push off this week from a beach in the capital Dakar with water, dried food and potentially dozens of passengers. He just needs two motors and enough petrol for the week-long journey and also to patch up a three-foot (1 meter) gash in the hull. 
Diallo is part of a resurgence in African migrants taking the treacherous Atlantic route to the Spanish territory this year in search of jobs and prosperity that they cannot find at home. 
Many migrants see the chain of islands off the Moroccan coast as the only viable option left as the European Union spends millions of dollars cutting off land routes through north Africa. They consider it a launchpad for asylum in mainland Europe. 
""Some, if they see a canoe, do not even consider staying here. They will leave at all costs,"" said Diallo, looking over the litter-strewn beach where listless teenagers mill about at dusk, some fixing fishing nets or painting boats in bright reds and blues.
Over 1,200 migrants arrived in the Canary Islands between Jan. 1 and Nov. 14, Spanish Interior Ministry data show, the highest in nine years and a four-fold increase over the same period in 2017. 
It marks the revival of a worrying trend. In 2006 - when 30,000 migrants managed to reach the Canary Islands - some 7,000 people died trying to make the crossing, rights groups say. In the decade that followed, Spanish patrols slowed the pace. Land routes through Niger and Libya to Italy became more popular. 
But the Italian government has focused on stopping the Libya route. With migrants detained in slave-like conditions in Libya, the numbers arriving in Italy have dropped off dramatically from a peak of 181,000 in 2016. 
Still, migrants' will to leave remains. The fall in arrivals to Italy has corresponded with a surge in attempts to reach Spain, where a record number of migrants has reached the mainland in recent months. 
""Managing... migratory flows is very much like squeezing a balloon. When one route closes, the flows increase on another,"" said Izabella Cooper, spokeswoman for EU border agency Frontex.
""The only solution to migration is to eliminate the root causes: wars and poverty."" 
""VERY, VERY BIG"" SEA
Migrants face many dangers on the open ocean, including mountainous waves, blistering heat and starvation. 
While the numbers remain small compared to arrivals on the Spanish mainland, authorities in Senegal and Gambia said there has been a rise in boats attempting the crossing to the Canary Islands this year.
The lack of data on departures makes it impossible to calculate how many die.
In October, Guinea Bissau's coastguard discovered the empty wreckage of a boat that had been carrying dozens of migrants. That same month, a boat with 72 Gambians and Senegalese heading for the Canary Islands was rescued off Guinea Bissau after an engine failure.
One of the migrants, Alieu Gaye, said he went by boat because he heard that land routes had become too dangerous. 
""People are afraid to take the road. They prefer to take canoes to travel by the Atlantic Ocean,"" he said.
Policing a coastline hundreds of miles long is a tough task, coast guards say. 
Spain's Guardia Civil has worked with the Senegalese Coast Guard since 2006 to intercept migrants. They have two 100-foot boats, one of which goes out every day, but crew members say they rarely find anything. 
""The sea is very, very big. And they can leave from wherever in Senegal, Gambia or further south,"" said Rafael Carballo Abeger, an attache at the Spanish embassy in Dakar. 
Assane Diallo is confident he can evade the coast guard when he leaves before dawn in the coming days. It is worth the risk, he says. Fish stocks are depleting and he can no longer provide for his wife and two children. 
""It's hard to come back and bring nothing home,"" he said. ""It hurts the heart, that's why I want to leave.""

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia's parliament is reviewing a five-year ban on more than 100 members of the main opposition party, which could allow them to return to politics, following threats by the European Union to deny duty-free trading access to the Southeast Asian nation.
The EU last month began a formal procedure to strip Cambodia of its ""Everything but Arms (EBA)"" initiative, after Prime Minister Hun Sen returned to power in a July general election in which his party won all the seats in parliament.
""In order to further promote democracy and the rule of law, the National Assembly is reviewing legal provisions to enable individuals who were banned from politics to resume their political activities,"" Cambodia's foreign ministry said on Monday.
It was referring to a Supreme Court ban on political activity by 118 members of the main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), which the court dissolved last year at the request of the government, over an accusation the party was plotting to take power with the help of the United States.
Cambodia's independent media also faced increasing pressure from Hun Sen and his allies ahead of the July vote.
The English-language Cambodia Daily shut down last year after the government ordered it to pay millions of dollars in back taxes or face closure. About 30 radio stations were also shut last year.
Washington-based Radio Free Asia (RFA) shut down its Phnom Penh office last September, complaining of a ""relentless crackdown on independent voices"".
The government ""always cherishes promotion of freedom of press and freedom of expression"", the Foreign Ministry added in Monday's statement, saying the RFA and Voice of America were free to reopen their offices in Cambodia.
The world's largest trading bloc has launched a six-month review of Cambodia's duty-free access, meaning its garments, sugar and other exports could face tariffs within 12 months, under EU rules.
""These announcements are likely conditions under withdrawal of 'Everything But Arms (EBA)',"" Naly Pilorge of the Cambodia-based Licadho rights group told Reuters.
""As with any announcements made in Cambodia, it's only possible to assess if they are genuine after the implementation of such announcements,"" Pilorge said.

Although the Socialists topped the poll, their position severely weakened in a region that they have governed since the end of Francisco Franco's dictatorship while far-right Vox party won 12 seats, the first far-right electoral success since Franco's death.
Ciudadanos' candidate Juan Marin rejected a coalition with the Socialists and said during an interview on national radio that he would present himself to lead the region after his party won 21 seats in the 109 seat parliament.
""We won't support a government of (regional Socialist leader) Susana Diaz or with the Socialist party. They've lost the confidence of the Andalusia people and so that possibility doesn't exist,"" Marin said. 
The Socialists took national leadership in June after a winning a vote of no-confidence against the previous conservative People's Party (PP) government following a slew of corruption charges. 
However, Prime Minister Sanchez rules the country with a minority government that has struggled to garner opposition party support to pass any meaningful laws since taking power, including next year's budget. 
Sanchez has said he aims to take the legislature through to 2020, though Sunday's upset will fuel calls for him to call an early national election. 
In Andalusia, the Socialists took 33 seats - not enough to form a government without a coalition - the conservative People's Party (PP) 26 while the left-wing Adelante Andalusia won 17 seats.

The Department of Justice in October indicted the executive, Maria Ressa, and online news platform Rappler (www.rappler.com), for attempting to evade taxes by not reporting gains of almost $3 million in the company's 2015 tax returns.
""I will continue addressing the charges with nothing other than to show they are politically motivated, and they are manufactured,"" Ressa told reporters after posting bail of 60,000 pesos ($1,148.33).
The court set her arraignment for Friday. 
Rappler has challenged Duterte frequently, questioning the accuracy of his public statements and scrutinizing his war on drugs and his foreign policies. It drew the ire of Duterte, who has lashed out at the news site in several public speeches.
Critics said the tax dodging case was an effort to crack down on critical media, a claim Duterte had denied.
In March, the Securities and Exchange Commission revoked Rappler's operating license for violating foreign ownership rules. Duterte's office has since banned Rappler from covering his official activities.
The news site also faces a cyber libel complaint from a businessman over a 2012 report on human trafficking and drug smuggling.
""More than his inability to tolerate dissent, Duterte's relentless persecution of media appears to be part of the increasingly authoritarian direction his presidency has taken,"" the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines said in a statement on Sunday.
New York-based Human Rights Watch demanded that charges against Ressa and her news organization be dropped, calling the case ""part of the Duterte administration's campaign to harass, threaten and intimidate critics"".

ALGIERS (Reuters) - Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman arrived in Algeria on Sunday from Mauritania, resuming a tour of Arab countries after attending the G20 summit in Argentina.
Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia received the prince in the capital Algiers, the state news agency APS said.
Before the summit, the heir to the throne of the world's top oil exporter had visited the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Egypt and Tunisia.
On his way to Algeria he had stopped over in Mauritania, where Saudi Arabia pledged to build a large hospital in the capital Nouakchott, state media said.
The crown prince is on his first trip abroad since the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, which has strained Saudi Arabia's ties with the West and battered the prince's image abroad.
Saudi Arabia has said the prince had no prior knowledge of the murder. After offering numerous contradictory explanations, Riyadh said last month that Khashoggi had been killed and his body dismembered when negotiations to persuade him to return to Saudi Arabia failed.
Algerian-Saudi investments and trade relations, especially in the oil and petrochemical sectors, will be discussed during the two-day visit, APS said on Saturday.
Algeria is one of the few Arab countries that has good relations with Saudi Arabia and its arch-rival Iran, both fellow OPEC members.
Algiers also has strong ties with Qatar, with which Saudi Arabia and three other Arab states severed trade and transport ties in June 2017, accusing it of supporting terrorism and Iran. Qatar denies the allegations.
Algeria is also on good terms with Turkey, whose relations with Saudi Arabia have been strained by the Khashoggi killing.
The Saudi prince is unlikely to face protests over the murder as he did in Tunisia, as demonstrations are banned in Algiers.

But a group of prominent journalists and intellectuals has written an open letter opposing his visit, saying it is ""unethical and politically inappropriate"".

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong authorities have barred a pro-democracy lawmaker from running in a local election for ""implicitly"" supporting Hong Kong's independence from China, in what critics said was another instance of civil rights being eroded in the China-ruled city
Eddie Chu, a former journalist who was democratically elected as one of Hong Kong's 70 legislators in a 2016 election, had planned to contest a separate grassroots poll to represent a village in the rural hinterland of the New Territories.
But an official with Hong Kong's Electoral Affairs Commission, Enoch Yuen, wrote to Chu on Sunday to disqualify his candidacy on the grounds that Chu had previously expressed support for ""independence as an option for Hong Kong people to self-determine their future"".
While Chu had written to Yuen stating he didn't support independence, she concluded that Chu's answers: ""When viewed objectively, can be understood as implicitly confirming that he supports independence could be an option for Hong Kong people"".
Chu said he might challenge this ""ridiculous"" decision in court, and that he had been stripped of a fundamental political right at a time when Beijing has tightened its grip on the city.
He pointed out that he was already an elected lawmaker with strong public backing, whose suitability for public office had never previously been questioned.
""They need to clearly tell the people of Hong Kong ... how they can, without any public consultation or legislative process, change the threshold of political screening.""
Hong Kong, a former British colony, reverted to Chinese rule in 1997 amid guarantees the territory would enjoy a high degree of autonomy and freedoms under a ""one country, two systems"" formula.
Over the past year, however, international concern has spread over a series of incidents that have further undermined confidence in Hong Kong's rights landscape, including the de facto expulsion of a British journalist after he hosted a speech by an independence activist at a press club.
The move against Chu adds to a list of other democrats who have been banned from contesting elections, fuelling fears of tightening political ""red lines"" by Beijing that could deny Hong Kong's disaffected young people any mainstream political careers beyond street protest.
In a statement, a government spokesman said late on Sunday that the government ""agrees to and supports the decision"" to ban Chu. It also denied there had been ""any political censorship, restriction of the freedom of speech or deprivation of the right to stand for elections"".

Hong Kong authorities say ""self-determination"", or seeking greater autonomy from China, violates the city's mini-constitution, the Basic Law, which states that Hong Kong is an inalienable part of China.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The big, luxurious airplane used to ferry Mexico's former president around the globe is about to fly away permanently in one of the first moves by the new president to rid the country of what he has derided as a towering symbol of excess.
""We are selling all the planes and helicopters that the corrupt politicians used,"" President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told a rally in Xalapa, Veracruz, near the end of his first full day as president. The crowd roared its approval.
Finance Minister Carlos Urzua convened a news conference in Mexico City earlier on Sunday, attended by a small army of local reporters in front of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 Dreamliner to announce that the plane will ""very soon"" be put up for sale.
Photographers and camera crews were then ushered into the aircraft to see for themselves the spacious interior emblazoned with official government seals on the walls and flat-screen monitors, as well as the presidential bedroom and what appeared to be a marble-lined bathroom.
The $218 million presidential jet acquired in late 2012 is one of 60 government planes that will be sold, in addition to 70 helicopters, said Urzua.
It will be flown on Monday to the Victorville airport in southern California at Boeing's recommendation as it awaits a new owner, according to a statement by the finance ministry. 
At the rally, Lopez Obrador ticked off other populist campaign promises, including ending the pensions for ex-presidents and a pay cut for senior government officials that he described as significant money savers.
On Saturday morning, just before his formal inauguration, , the veteran leftist ordered the doors open at Los Pinos, the opulent residence of Mexican presidents dating back eight decades.
Families lounged in the gardens, ran through corridors to peek into offices and rooms, and listened to musical ensembles that were invited to play.
Known for his frugal living, Lopez Obrador has often said he will not live at Los Pinos, and instead will convert the sprawling property into a cultural center.

Lopez Obrador won a landslide election victory in large part by seizing on widespread disgust with Mexico's governing elite, viewed by many as out-of-touch and deeply corrupt.

May is facing an uphill struggle to get lawmakers to back her deal to keep close economic ties with the bloc, which she agreed with the EU in November. The main opposition Labour Party says it will seek a vote of no confidence in the government if May loses the vote.
The pact has been criticized within May's own party, both by supporters of a cleaner break with the EU and by opponents of Brexit. A Northern Irish party which props up her minority government has said it will vote against it.
After visiting Argentina for a G20 summit, May will say her meetings with leaders showed that several countries were ready to negotiate trade deals ""as soon as possible"". Swift new trade deals are a major demand for Brexit campaigners.
""Once we leave the EU, we can and we will strike ambitious trade deals,"" May will tell parliament, according to excerpts of her speech. ""For the first time in more than 40 years we will have an independent trade policy, and we will continue to be a passionate advocate for the benefits open economies and free markets can bring.""
She will say that she had meetings with leaders keen to strike trade deals, including the hosts Argentina, Australia, Chile and Japan. With Japan, Britain wants to work quickly to set up a new arrangement based on Japan's existing partnership agreement with the EU, she will say.
The government says that if May's deal is voted down there is a risk Britain will exit the EU with no agreement at all, with serious potential economic consequences.

Some opponents of Brexit have campaigned for a new referendum giving voters the option to reverse Britain's 2016 vote to leave the bloc, although the government says no such new vote will be held.

196,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2018 06:20PM ET</span>",Merkel protege suggests reducing gas flow through Nord Stream 2 pipeline,"By Andrea Shalal
BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany must answer urgent, growing political concerns about the planned Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project given Russia's seizure of three Ukrainian ships and their crew off the coast of Crimea, a senior German conservative said on Sunday.
Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, a top candidate to replace Chancellor Angela Merkel as leader of the Christian Democrats, told public broadcaster ARD it would be ""too radical"" to withdraw political support for the project, but Berlin could reduce the amount of gas to flow through the pipeline.
Russia is resisting international calls to release three Ukrainian ships seized last weekend in the Kerch Strait near the Crimea region that Moscow illegally annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Moscow has accused the 24 sailors of illegally crossing the Russian border, which Ukraine denies.
After meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Merkel on Saturday called on Russia to release the sailors and allow free shipping access to the Sea of Azov, but stopped short of endorsing any additional sanctions against Moscow.
Kramp-Karrenbauer is a close Merkel ally but has taken a firmer stance on Russia's actions in recent days. On Friday, she told Reuters the European Union and the United States should consider banning from their ports Russian ships originating from the Sea of Azov in response to the incident.
She told ARD on Sunday that it was time to draw a firmer line against Russian actions, including its annexation of Crimea and its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine.
""We have to acknowledge that the hard point has not been reached, otherwise Putin would not have taken this path,"" she said, although she noted that Russia had continued to provide Germany with gas supplies even during the Cold War. 
Her suggestion of banning Russian ships from European ports triggered criticism from some Social Democrats, including former foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel, who urged calm and accused Ukraine of trying to drag Germany into a war with Russia.
Justice Minister Katarina Barley, appearing on the same ARD programme on Sunday, said the incident still needed to be investigated, and cautioned against too-hasty conclusions.
The $11-billion Nord Stream 2 project, led by Russia's Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), aims to double capacity of the existing Nord Stream 1 pipeline from next year, bypassing traditional routes through Ukraine.
Businessman Friedrich Merz, the other top contender for the CDU leadership role, on Friday said escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine had renewed debate over the pipeline.
""The more the conflict escalates, the more it raises the question: Is it really the right thing that we build this pipeline?"" he said.

The United States, Ukraine and eastern European states oppose the pipeline, arguing that it will harm Ukraine and reduce the transit fees it now earns for piping gas. Washington also argues that the pipeline will leave Germany dependent on Russia for decades to come.

Buhari, who is running for re-election in February, spent five months in Britain last year being treated for an undisclosed illness. One theory widely aired on social media - and by some political opponents - was that he had been replaced by a lookalike from Sudan called Jubril.
No evidence has been presented, but videos making the claim have still been viewed thousands of times on YouTube and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
""It's real me, I assure you. I will soon celebrate my 76th birthday and I will still go strong,"" Buhari told Nigerians in a town hall session in Poland, where he was attending a conference, when asked about Jubril.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Donald Trump wants North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to know that he likes him and will fulfill his wishes, South Korea's President Moon Jae-in said on Sunday, a day after meeting the U.S. president at an economic summit in Argentina.
Moon, who is hoping to host Kim soon on the first ever trip to Seoul by a North Korean leader as agreed earlier this year, said Trump had asked him to pass on a message.
""The message is that President Trump has very favorable views toward Chairman Kim and he likes him,"" Moon told reporters aboard a flight from Argentina to New Zealand, where he started a three-day state visit on Sunday. 
""As such, he asked me to tell Chairman Kim that he wants to implement the rest of their agreement together and he will fulfill Chairman Kim's wishes.""
Trump, who met Kim in Singapore in June, said on Saturday that he is likely to meet the North Korean leader for a second time in January or February, with three sites for their meeting under consideration.
""We're getting along very well. We have a good relationship,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on his return from the G20 summit. Trump added that at some point he will invite Kim to the United States.
Kim and Trump pledged at their first meeting to work towards denuclearisation, although the two sides have since made little progress agreeing on a timeline or concrete steps.
The White House said in a statement on Saturday after Trump's meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping that they and Kim will strive ""to see a nuclear free Korean Peninsula"". The statement said Xi and Trump ""agreed that great progress has been made with respect to North Korea."" 
Trump has frequently described a warm personal relationship with Kim, arguing that this rapport would help him succeed at a diplomatic breakthrough that has eluded U.S. presidents since the 1950s.
In September Trump drew applause from a crowd of supporters at a campaign rally by describing ""beautiful"" letters he had exchanged with Kim, saying: ""We fell in love, ok?""
Trump's critics say such warm words have so far failed to yield concrete concessions from one of the world's most authoritarian states.
Trump's latest praise for Kim, in the formal setting of a summit with Moon, shows that he is still emphasizing his personal rapport despite stalled nuclear talks.

Moon said a second summit between Kim and Trump will prove to be the ""most critical moment"" for North Korea's denuclearisation.

199,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2018 05:33PM ET</span>",Britain's Labour threatens PM May with new Brexit hurdle,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's main opposition Labour Party said on Sunday it would press for contempt proceedings against the government if Prime Minister Theresa May fails to produce the full legal advice she has received on her Brexit deal.
The threat is yet another hurdle for May to clear before parliament votes on Dec. 11 on her deal for Britain's exit from the European Union, its biggest shift in foreign and trade policy for more than 40 years.
With the odds looking stacked against her, May is touring the country and media studios to try to win over critics including both eurosceptics and europhiles who say the deal will leave Britain a diminished state, still linked economically to the EU but no longer having any say over the rules.
May often says her deal will protect jobs and end free movement. She hopes her argument that it is the only feasible deal with the EU and that voting it down will raise the risks of a ""no-deal"" Brexit or no Brexit at all will concentrate minds.
Labour has said it will vote against the deal. On Sunday its Brexit spokesman, Keir Starmer, increased the pressure on May by saying Labour would start contempt proceedings against the government if it did not publish its legal advice. 
He also said Labour would seek a vote of no confidence in the government if she lost the vote, a widely forecast outcome.
""In nine days' time, parliament has got to take probably the most important decision it has taken for a generation and it's obviously important that we know the full legal implications of what the prime minister wants us to sign up to,"" Starmer said.
""I don't want to go down this path ... (but) if they don't produce it tomorrow then we will start contempt proceedings. This would be a collision course between the government and parliament,"" he told Sky News.
British media said the contempt move was also supported by the small Northern Irish party which props up May's minority government, underlining her precarious position in parliament.
""GIANT STEEL TRAP""
May's former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, a prominent opponent of May's deal and advocate of a much sharper break with the EU, also weighed in. 
In his weekly column in the Telegraph newspaper, he said he backed the calls for the government to publish the advice, adding that it showed what some feared - a so-called backstop arrangement for Northern Ireland was ""a great steel trap that is about to clamp its jaws around our hind limbs and prevent our escape"".
The government has promised to give lawmakers access to the legal analysis of the Brexit deal and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox will make a statement to parliament on Monday. Opposition parties suspect it will only offer a summary of that advice.
""This is an unprecedented situation and that's why we've got an unprecedented situation just tomorrow when the attorney general will be making a statement to parliament,"" Conservative Party Chairman Brandon Lewis told Sky News.
""And I would hope again that when colleagues hear what the attorney general has to say, they will be satisfied that the government has delivered on what it said it would do."" 
Under parliamentary rules, it is up to the speaker to decide whether to allow a contempt motion to be voted upon. If it passes, it would then be referred to a committee which would rule on whether contempt had taken place. If so, it would then recommend a punishment, which lawmakers must agree.
Critics of May say the advice could contain warnings about certain parts of her withdrawal deal with Brussels, especially over the status of Northern Ireland and, if published, might stiffen opposition to the accord.
But her environment minister, Michael Gove, again said that, while not perfect, the deal was the best Britain could get.

""I believe that we can win the argument and win the vote. I know it's challenging but my view is ... that we've got to make those arguments and we've got to look properly at what those alternatives are,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show.

It was the first time the nationalist surge that has swept other European countries had reached Spain, long seen as immune because many still remember the military dictatorship that ended in 1975. 
The preliminary official results showed the Socialists, who have ruled the southern region since Spain's return to democracy, getting most votes, but falling well short of a majority with only 33 of the regional parliament's 109 seats.
The vote was the first electoral test for both Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and the new leader of the conservative People's Party, Pablo Casado.
Votes were widely distributed and it was arithmetically possible that the conservative People's Party and Ciudadanos could form a majority coalition with Vox's backing.
This would rattle national politics, with a series of local, regional and European elections scheduled for May.
The preliminary results showed the People's Party getting 26 seats and the centre-right Ciudadanos 21. 
With the far-left Podemos getting only 17 seats, the Socialists would have to seek other allies if they want to keep power in Andalusia.
French far-right leader Marine Le Pen tweeted: ""Strong and warm congratulations to my friends from @Vox, who tonight in Spain scored a very meaningful result for such a young and dynamic movement.""
The election took place in a political landscape in which major parties find it harder and harder to secure majorities. Vox was founded at the end of 2013. 
The next national election is due in 2020 but speculation has been rife for months that Sanchez, who controls fewer than a quarter of seats in the Madrid parliament, could call a snap vote.
Senior Socialists said before the election in Andalusia that they did not expect it to trigger a general election.

Andalusia has one of the highest unemployment rates in Europe and is the main arrival point in Spain for migrants crossing the Mediterranean. The number reaching Spain has grown in the past year as traffic on the main sea route to Europe, from Libya to Italy, has slowed.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday condemned what he called Iran's testing of a medium-range ballistic missile in violation of the 2015 international agreement on the Iranian nuclear programme, from which Washington has withdrawn.
""Missile tests ... are carried out for defence and the country's deterrence, and we will continue this,"" Brigadier- General Abolfazl Shekarchi, spokesman for Iran's armed forces, was quoted as saying by the semi-official Tasnim news agency. 
""We will continue to both develop and test missiles. This is outside the framework of (nuclear) negotiations and part of our national security, for which we will not ask any country's permission,"" Shekarchi said.
He did not confirm or deny Iran had tested a new missile.
Earlier, U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton tweeted: ""Iran just test-fired a ... ballistic missile capable of reaching Israel and Europe. This provocative behaviour cannot be tolerated.""
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi also said Iranian missiles were purely defensive and added: ""There is no Security Council resolution prohibiting missile programme and missile tests by Iran.""
U.N. Security Council resolution 2231 enshrined Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States in which Tehran curbed its disputed uranium enrichment programme in exchange for an end to international sanctions.
The resolution says Iran is ""called upon"" to refrain for up to eight years from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons.
""SURREALISM IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS""
Iran has repeatedly said its missile programme is purely defensive and denied that its missiles are capable of being tipped with nuclear warheads, or that it has any intent of developing nuclear weapons through uranium enrichment.
In May, President Donald Trump pulled Washington out of the nuclear deal, approved before he took office, and reimposed sanctions on Tehran. Trump said the deal was flawed as it did not include curbs on Iran's development of ballistic missiles or its support for armed proxies in Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and Iraq.
""Surrealism is now the US' modus operandi in its foreign affairs,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted.
""While (the United States) itself violates (U.N. Security Council resolution) 2231 — and even threatens to punish those who don't wish to violate it in abiding with illegal US sanctions — it now falsely accuses Iran of violating the very SAME resolution,"" Zarif added.
Separately, Zarif accused Washington of arming militant groups that fight against the Tehran-backed Syrian government and the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement in Yemen.
""US (is) proliferating advanced weapons to extremists incl Al Qaeda & ISIS (Islamic State),"" Zarif tweeted, referring to a British newspaper report that said many arms supplied by Britain and the United States had ended up in the hands of militias fighting in the Yemen war.
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt tweeted that he was deeply concerned by ""Iran's test-firing of a medium range ballistic missile. Provocative, threatening and inconsistent with UNSCR 2231"". 

""Our support for (the Iran nuclear accord) in no way lessens our concern at Iran's destabilising missile programme and determination that it should cease,"" Hunt added.

Slovakia's Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini, however, said the court's decision was questionable. 
Fifteen activists from the Czech Republic, Belgium and Finland were detained on Wednesday after hanging a banner reading ""Stop the age of coal"" from a tower at a coal mine that supplies one of Slovakia's most polluting power plants.
No one was harmed during the protest but the mining company, HBP, said 342 miners underground were put in danger as all operations at the premises were halted for several hours. 
Three of the activists were released on Wednesday, while the rest were charged with a criminal offence of endangering a strategic utility.
The regional court in Prievidza, central Slovakia, did not set a date for a trial. Lawyers for the activists filed an appeal against the decision to keep them in custody, Greenpeace told Reuters. 
If the decision is upheld, they could stay in the pre-trial custody for up to 12 months.
""The court's decision is unprecedented. Activists are not criminals, they staged a non-violent protest against a company that has been polluting the region and Slovakia for decades,"" Greepeace's chief in Slovakia, Ivana Kohutkova, said in a statement.
Prime Minister Pellegrini said only perpetrators who pose a risk to society should be held in pre-trial custody. 
Slovakia's economy minister announced last month that the state will phase out subsidies for coal mines supplying one of the country's most polluting power plants from 2023. 
The government supports privately owned Hornonitrianske Bane Prievidza (HBP), Slovakia's only coal miner, paying around 100 million euros ($114 million) a year, which helps maintain thousands of jobs. The company produced 1.8 million tonnes of brown coal last year, supplying the Novaky power plant in central Slovakia. The facility is operated by Slovenske Elektrarne, a utility co-owned by the state, Italy's  Enel  (MI:ENEI) and Czech energy group EPH.
Closing the mines has long been contentious as they employ around 4,000 people directly and 11,000 indirectly, although there are potentially opportunities in Slovakia's booming car industry for retrained workers to secure another job.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - On his first full day in office, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador defended a plan to end lawlessness with a new national guard, an initiative that risks upsetting some supporters who favor a less militarized approach.
In a Sunday morning speech, Mexico's first leftist president in decades continued to pivot from an emphasis during the campaign on peaceful reconciliation and even amnesty for some involved in the country's grueling drug war to a more traditional approach defined by more soldiers and police.
""We must adjust to a new era,"" he said, flanked by generals at a military base in the capital, while emphasizing that his security policy will also respect human rights.
In the first phase of his plan, a 60,000-strong national guard force made up of army, navy and other federal police will battle crime while a constitutional reform will be pursued to cement the new strategy.
Lopez Obrador has said the strategy will be put to a public vote, likely in March.
A second phase will add additional military forces to the effort.
""The people of Mexico need their armed forces to address this grave problem of insecurity and violence right now,"" said Lopez Obrador, often turning toward the uniformed officers assembled behind him to address them directly.
""We've opted for this plan because we trust the armed forces,"" he said.
Over the past dozen years, Mexican security forces have toppled some high-profile drug kingpins but more than 200,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands more disappeared since a military-focused approach was initiated in 2006.
The last couple years have seen record numbers of murders, including in some of the country's most fabled tourist destinations like Acapulco and Los Cabos. 
Lopez Obrador's new security focus has already stirred unease among some human rights activists, who argue the plan ignores past abuses stemming from the ""militarization"" of public safety.
""We call on the new government to back a civil security model that can create conditions for a gradual withdrawal of the armed forces in public security work,"" a coalition of leading human rights groups said in a statement late last month. 
In addition to the national guard plan, Lopez Obrado has offered a six-year security blueprint that criticizes drug prohibition as both ineffective and arbitrary. The new president's allies in Congress have already proposed legislation to decriminalize and regulate the use of marijuana. 
During the campaign, his security aides outlined plans to reduce jail time for some crimes, as well as stiffer controls on weapons. The strategy leaned heavily on ""transitional justice,"" which often involves leniency for those who admit guilt, truth commissions to investigate atrocities and the granting of reparations for victims.
The landslide election winner has not yet detailed how those policies will the implemented.

TBILISI (Reuters) - Thousands of Georgians protested in the capital Tbilisi on Sunday against the result of the country's presidential election, as defeated candidate Grigol Vashadze said opposition parties would challenge the outcome in court.
Vashadze has described the election as a ""criminal farce"" and has called for snap parliamentary elections after the central election commission said on Thursday that Salome Zurabishvili, who was backed by the ruling Georgian Dream party, had secured 59.5 percent of the vote. Vashadze had 40.5 percent, it said.
""We don't recognize illegitimate results of this rigged election and demand an early parliamentary election to be called in the country,"" Vashadze told thousands of supporters at Sunday's rally in Tbilisi.
Zurabishvili is set to become the country's first female head of state, although the role is largely ceremonial.
Vashadze said the opposition planned to challenge the election results in court and would offer to work with the government to make changes to the electoral code, followed by snap parliamentary elections.
International observers, in their assessment of the election, said on Thursday that the vote was competitive, but the ruling party had enjoyed an ""undue advantage"" and increased misuse of administrative resources ""further blurred the line between party and state.""
Vashadze said that if the government rejects the opposition's demands, another peaceful protest would be held on Dec. 16, the day of the president-elect's inauguration.
Political analysts say they do not expect the election result to trigger any serious unrest in Georgia, an ally of the United States in the Caucasus region.
Under a revised constitution, the prime minister and government wield most executive power. But the presidency is still seen as an important position as the international face of the country, which aims to secure better relations with the West to counter Moscow's influence. 
Both Zurabishvili and Vashadze favor strong ties with the West. 
Zurabishvili, a former French career diplomat who served as Georgia's foreign minister from 2004-2005, told Reuters in an interview on Saturday that the opposition's call for people to refuse to recognize the results of the election served Russia's interests.
""That's exactly what Russia would have wished for - to have a very divided and very weakened country and a discredited president whose legitimacy is under attack,"" she said.
Moscow's influence in the country dominates Georgia's domestic politics, with rival parties accusing each other of being insufficiently firm in confronting it.

Russia fought and won a brief war against Georgia in 2008, after which Moscow recognized the independence of two Georgian breakaway regions, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Russia now has troop garrisons in the two regions.

206,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2018 11:34AM ET</span>",Macron tells PM to hold talks after worst unrest in Paris for decades,"By Jean-Baptiste Vey and John Irish
PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron ordered his prime minister on Sunday to hold talks with political leaders and demonstrators, as he sought a way out of nationwide protests after rioters turned central Paris into a battle zone.
Riot police on Saturday were overwhelmed as protesters ran amok in Paris's wealthiest neighborhoods, torching dozens of cars, looting boutiques and smashing up luxury private homes and cafes in the worst disturbances the capital has seen since 1968.
The unrest began as a backlash against fuel tax hikes but has spread. It poses the most formidable challenge yet to Macron's presidency, with the escalating violence and depth of public anger against his economic reforms catching the 40-year-old leader off-guard and battling to regain control.
After a meeting with members of his government on Sunday, the French presidency said in a statement that the president had asked his interior minister to prepare security forces for future protests and his prime minister to hold talks with political party leaders and representatives of the protesters.
A French presidential source said Macron would not speak to the nation on Sunday despite calls for him to offer immediate concessions to demonstrators, and said the idea of imposing a state of emergency had not been discussed. 
Arriving back from the G20 summit in Argentina, Macron had earlier rushed to the Arc de Triomphe, a revered monument and epicenter of Saturday's clashes, where protesters had scrawled ""Macron resign"" and ""The yellow vests will triumph"".
The ""yellow vest"" rebellion erupted out of nowhere on Nov. 17, with protesters blocking roads across France and impeding access to some shopping malls, fuel depots and airports. Violent groups from the far right and far left as well as youths from the suburbs infiltrated Saturday's protests, the authorities said.
Government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux had indicated the Macron administration was considering imposing a state of emergency. The president was open to dialogue, he said, but would not reverse policy reforms.
""We won't change course. We are certain of that,"" he told Europe 1 radio.
As he spoke, workmen in the upper-crust district of central Paris set about cleaning the defaced Arc, removing charred hulks of cars and replacing the shattered windows of banks, restaurants and glitzy boutiques. [L8N1Y70AN]
MACRON UNYIELDING
While the protests were initially against Macron's fuel tax hikes - necessary he says to combat climate change - they have also mined a vein of deep dissatisfaction felt toward his liberal reforms, which many voters feel favor the wealthy and big business.
Police said they had arrested more than 400 people in Paris on Saturday and that 133 were injured. Some 10,000 tear gas canisters and stun grenades were fired as well as water canon as security forces fought for control.
Macron's plight illustrates a conundrum: How do political leaders' introduce policies that will do long-term good for the environment without inflicting extra costs on voters that may damage their chances of re-election?
His unyielding response has exposed him to charges of being out of touch with common folk outside of France's big cities who worry about the squeeze on household budgets and job security.
The protests have driven Macron's popularity to record lows and left him facing a lose-lose situation, said Gael Sliman, president of the Odoxa polling institute said.
Either Macron caves in to the pressure and is derided by opponents as weak, or he puts down the dissent, Sliman said. 
""In the second scenario, Macron will still come out loser, because what everyone will remember is that he wrestled with the popular classes. He would be victorious, but at the cost of having crushed them.""
Before heading into Sunday's meeting, Macron met under heavy security with police and firefighters near the Champs Elysees boulevard. Some bystanders cheered, others jeered and called on him to resign.
So too did Jean-Luc Melenchon, head of hard-left party La France Insoumise (France Unbowed) and far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who both demanded the government unwind its fuel tax hikes. They called for parliament to be dissolved and snap elections held.
Such an outcome is unlikely, however. Macron has 3 1/2 years left of his five-year mandate and a strong majority in parliament, albeit with signs of simmering unease on the backbenches over his response to the protests. 
TV footage showed the interior of the Arc ransacked, a statue of Marianne, symbol of the French republic, smashed, and graffiti scrawled on the exterior ranging from anti-capitalist slogans to social demands and calls for Macron's resignation.
On nearby streets, some Parisians worried of a repeat of the violence next weekend. The yellow vests have already called another demonstration in Paris.

""The violence is increasing at an exponential rate,"" said Claude, a resident in the affluent 16th district. ""The state is losing control, it is scary. They cannot let this happen. Maybe the army should intervene.""

207,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2018 11:33AM ET</span>",Emphasis on urgency as climate talks begin in coal city Katowice,"By Barbara Lewis and Anna Koper
KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - Delegates from nearly 200 nations on Sunday began two weeks of talks to tackle deep political divisions at the most important U.N. meeting on global warming since the landmark 2015 Paris deal to shift away from fossil fuels.
Expectations are low that negotiations in Katowice, at the heart of Poland's coal region, will fully resolve concerns laid out in reports over recent weeks on the severity of rising greenhouse gas emissions.
The political climate has also been transformed since the Paris agreement and the fragile global unity that brought about that accord has shattered.
""This is a very, very important conference,"" U.N. climate chief Patricia Espinosa told reporters. ""It also takes place in a scenario where we have clear signals about the urgency with which we need to address the issues of climate change.""
Four former presidents of U.N. talks, including Laurent Fabius of France, who led negotiations for the Paris agreement, issued a statement urging ""decisive action"".
""The world is at a crossroads and decisive action in the next two years will be crucial to tackle these urgent threats,"" they said in the joint statement.
However, political divisions were clear from the outset, with Brazil having withdrawn its offer to host the 2019 talks.
The United States, meanwhile, reiterated at the G20 summit in Argentina on Saturday its decision to withdraw from the Paris accord and a U.S. commitment to all energy sources.
YEAR-END DEADLINE
The other members of the group of industrialized nations - including the biggest polluter, China - reaffirmed their commitment to implementing the Paris deal, taking into account their national circumstances.
The Katowice talks precede an end-of-year deadline to produce a ""rule book"" to flesh out the broad details that were agreed in Paris on limiting the rise in global temperatures to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius.
Delegates said that one of the trickiest issues could be monitoring emissions as the United States, which cannot quit the pact until 2020, uses the talks to press for a level of detail it perceives as useful to its foreign policy dealings. 
Poland is hosting U.N. climate negotiations for a third time, but the nation remains hooked on coal, the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel. Coal provides about 80 percent of Poland's power and has been a major source of employment and national pride.
The younger generation is less emotionally attached to coal and is increasingly environmentally aware, though any phasing out of the fuel in Poland is likely to be slow.

The energy ministry said only last week that Poland plans to invest in new coal capacity while its long-term energy strategy assumes it will still obtain about 60 percent of its power from coal in 2030.

208,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2018 10:38AM ET</span>","Be celibate or leave the priesthood, pope tells gay priests","By Philip Pullella
VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Men with deep-rooted homosexual tendencies should not be admitted to the Catholic clergy, and it would be better for priests who are actively gay to leave rather than lead a double life, Pope Francis says in a new book.
While he has previously spoken of the need for better screening of candidates for the religious life, his comments suggesting that priests who cannot keep their vows of celibacy should leave are some of his clearest to date.
Francis made the comments in a book-length interview with Spanish priest Fernando Prado called ""The Strength of Vocation"", in which he discusses the challenges of being a priest or nun today.
Francis said in the book that homosexuality in the Church ""is something that worries me"". It is due to be published this week in several languages. An advance copy of the Italian version was made available to Reuters.
""The question of homosexuality is a very serious one,"" he said, adding that those entrusted with training men to be priests must be certain that candidates are ""humanly and emotionally mature"" before they can be ordained.
This also applied to women who wanted to enter female religious communities to become nuns. In the Catholic Church, priests, nuns and monks all take vows of celibacy.
The Church teaches that homosexual tendencies are not sinful in themselves, but homosexual acts are.
Francis said there was ""no room for this"" in the lives of priests and nuns, adding that the Church had to be ""demanding"" in choosing candidates for what is known as the consecrated life.
""For this reason, the Church urges that persons with this rooted tendency not be accepted into (priestly) ministry or consecrated life,"" he said.
""BETTER TO LEAVE""
He urged homosexuals who are already priests or nuns to be celibate and responsible to avoid creating scandal. ""It is better that they leave the priesthood or the consecrated life rather than live a double life,"" he said.
The interview was conducted in mid-August. Less than two weeks later, on Aug. 26, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, the Vatican's former ambassador to the Vatican, threw the Church into turmoil with a bombshell statement against the pope and Vatican officials.
Vigano said a ""homosexual network"" existed in the Vatican, whose members helped promote each other's careers in the Church.
He also accused the pope of having ignored alleged sexual misconduct with adult male seminarians by former American cardinal Theodore McCarrick, 88.
The Vatican said Vigano's accusations were riddled with ""calumny and defamation"".
The Catholic Church has been haunted for more than two decades by evidence of thousands of cases of sexual abuse of minors by clergy around the world, in countries ranging from the United States to Australia, Ireland, Belgium, Germany and Chile.
In July, McCarrick became the first cardinal to resign in nearly 100 years after U.S. Church officials said allegations made in a separate investigation that he had sexually abused a 16-year-old boy almost 50 years ago were credible and substantiated.

McCarrick has said he had no recollection of the alleged abuse of the minor, but has not commented on the allegations of misconduct with the seminarians, which allegedly took place decades ago.

LISBON (Reuters) - China wants to strengthen its relations with Portugal through a strategic partnership that aims to take advantage of the Iberian country's important location along Beijing's road and belt initiative, China's President Xi Jinping wrote on Sunday.
In an article published in Portuguese daily Diario de Noticias ahead of Xi's visit to Lisbon this week, the Chinese president wrote that relations between the two ""transcends time and distance and is a partnership looking to the future.""
Xi starts his two-day visit on Tuesday, during which he will meet the president and prime minister.
While there are growing suspicions elsewhere in Europe about Chinese acquisitions, in recent years Lisbon has been open to Chinese investment, including in strategic sectors like energy, and has nurtured close relations with Beijing. China Three Gorges launched a bid for utility company EDP this year, Portugal's largest company.
Xi wrote that Portugal and China would work jointly in developing the road and belt initiative, a modern-day silk road through which Beijing aims to develop infrastructure links and investment in Europe, Asia and Africa.
""Portugal is an important link between the maritime and land silk road and therefore there are natural advantages to Chinese-Portuguese cooperation on the road and belt initiative,"" Xi wrote.
That could lead to cooperation in areas from automobiles, renewable energy, finance to the construction of ports, Xi wrote. Portugal's southern deepwater port of Sines, situated on the south-western corner of Europe, is seen as a key location in the plan. 
Xi also wrote that the two countries aim to jointly develop ""blue economy"" partnerships through research and investment. The countries announced last month a joint project for micro satellites to collect data used in agriculture, fishery and oceanography.
Chinese residents have become the leading non-European applicants for Portugal's so-called 'golden visas', whereby foreigners get residency in return for property investments of at least 500,000 euros.

A range of Portuguese assets have been bought by Chinese companies, especially during its 2011-14 debt crisis, ranging from finance to insurance, healthcare and the electric grid.

Abdul Manan, who was in charge of Helmand province for the insurgent group, was killed along with 29 others by an air strike on Saturday while he was meeting local commanders and fighters in the Nawzad district, Helmand provincial governor Mohammad Yasin Khan said.
His death was confirmed by Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid and by the U.S. military, which said Afghan forces had gone on the offensive with U.S. support, notably through precision air strikes to push the Taliban to accept peace talks.
""They're going to have trouble intensifying the fight when their fighters and leaders are under constant assault. Peace talks are the only solution,"" Col Dave Butler, spokesman for U.S. Forces in Afghanistan, said in an emailed statement.
The death of Mullah Manan, who commanded Taliban fighters as they steadily increased their control over Helmand in the years following the end of most international combat missions in 2014, was seen as a major success by Afghan officials.
""He was the most senior Taliban commander in the south and his death will have an overall impact on security,"" one senior security official in Kabul said.
The report of Manan's death comes as both the Western-backed security forces and the Taliban have pushed to gain the momentum at the same time as efforts have stepped up to find a peaceful settlement to end the 17-year war in Afghanistan.
Although contacts have started between U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban representatives, there has been no let up in the fighting, with both sides aiming to build a favorable position in advance of any peace talks.

Wiam Wahhab, a Druze ally of the powerful Shi'ite group Hezbollah who has close ties to Damascus, has been at the heart of rising political tension over the last week with a series of verbal attacks on Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri.
Hariri supporters lodged a legal complaint against him after a video surfaced in which he was widely perceived to direct obscene insults at the Hariri family, including the late prime minister Rafik al-Hariri, without naming them. 
The tension has cast another shadow over efforts to form a new national unity government more than six months since an election, with rival parties still unable to agree on how to share out portfolios in the new cabinet.
The internal security forces said they went to Wahhab's village of al-Jahiliya on Saturday evening to take him for questioning after the public prosecutor accepted the legal complaint against him and referred the matter to the police.
In a statement, police said one of Wahhab's aides - Mohamed Abu Diyab - was shot in ""random"" gunfire by Wahhab supporters and denied the police had opened fire.
Wahhab's Arab Tawhid Party said he was hit by a bullet fired by ""the attackers"".
Wahhab said on Saturday the incident meant ""civil war"" but on Sunday urged calm while addressing Abu Diyab's funeral in Jahilya.
""I am working to calm the atmosphere. I have (told) the guys it is forbidden to block roads or to annoy any citizen or to open fire during the funeral,"" Wahhab told al-Jadeed TV.
Wahhab accused officials including Hariri of responsibility for the killing.
A source close to Hariri, referring to Saturday's events, said: ""These were judicial proceedings in which we had no intervention"".
Wahhab has said his comments in the video, which appeared to have been shot by mobile phone at a private gathering, were ""general"" and not directed at Rafik al-Hariri.
Hariri's Future Movement said last week the Hariris were being targeted by ""a campaign of falsehoods"" hatched by ""sick minds"" bent on destabilizing Lebanon and obstructing efforts to form the new government.

Lebanon has suffered spasms of political crisis and violence since its 1975-90 civil war. Hariri, Lebanon's main Sunni politician, currently heads a caretaker government.

Nearly four years of war between a Saudi-led coalition and the Iranian-aligned Houthi group have crippled healthcare and sanitation systems in Yemen, where some 1.2 million suspected cholera cases have been reported since 2017, with 2,515 deaths.
The World Health Organization (WHO) warned in October that the outbreak is accelerating again with roughly 10,000 suspected cases now reported per week, double the average rate for the first eight months of 2018.
Most cases have been reported in areas held by the Houthi movement, which controls most population centers after ousting the internationally recognized government from Sanaa in 2014.
""We receive information of reported cases of cholera from the Ministry of Health, then the team sterilizes the house and 20 houses around it,"" Nabeel Abdullah al-Wazeer, the Houthis' minister of water, told Reuters in Sanaa.
""We worked from house to house and on sterilizing water wells. We also worked on bus-mounted tanks, which transport water in the private sector to the citizens, as well as sterilizing local institutions which distribute water.""
Adel Moawada, director general of technical affairs at Sanaa's main water sanitation plant, said there are currently 20 automated chlorination units installed in wells directly linked to the capital's water distribution network. 
Cholera, which is spread by consuming contaminated food or water, is a diarrheal disease and can kill within hours. While previous outbreaks may have helped build immunity in the population, other diseases and widespread malnutrition can weaken resilience.
The United Nations says about 14 million people, or half of Yemen's population, could soon face famine. Some 1.8 million children are malnourished, according to UNICEF.
Children account for 30 percent of cholera infections.
Pediatrician Mohammed Abdulmughni administers intravenous fluids to children in WHO tents in Sanaa. Their beds rest on gravel and flies circle their faces.
""With winter's arrival we expected the numbers would decrease, yet the cases have been coming in at the same pace,"" he said. ""We expected positive (diagnoses) cases to decrease but the cases remain high.""
If caught early, acute diarrhea can be treated with oral hydration salts, but more severe cases require intravenous fluids and antibiotics.
More than 250,000 cases of cholera have been recorded in Yemen since the beginning of 2018, with 358 associated deaths, UNICEF representative Meritxell Relano told Reuters.

""We have prevented an outbreak at the scale of 2017,"" Relano said. ""But the risk is still there.""

On Friday, the aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said that unknown gunmen have raped 125 women during a 10-day spree of violence in Bentiu, but local officials disputed the report.
South Sudan has suffered a wrenching five-year civil war and, despite a fragile peace accord signed two months ago by the government and rebel groups, remains riven with ethnic grievances and awash with weapons. Civilians from rival groups bear the brunt of the violence and cycle of revenge.
The U.N. mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) said approximately 125 women and girls have sought medical treatment after having been raped or sexually assaulted as they walked along roads near Nhialdu and Guit on their way to Bentiu and that victims reported the attacks as having been carried out by young men in civilian clothing or military uniforms. They were also beaten and robbed, it said.
""The violent assaults happened in a Government-controlled area,"" David Shearer, the head of the U.N. mission, said in a statement. ""UNMISS peacekeepers have immediately sent patrols to the area to provide a protective presence and our human rights team has launched an investigation to identify the perpetrators.""

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli police on Sunday said they had found enough evidence for bribery and fraud charges to be brought against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife in a third corruption case against the Israeli leader.
Authorities allege Netanyahu awarded regulatory favors to Israel's leading telecommunications company, Bezeq Telecom Israel (TA:BEZQ), in return for more positive coverage of him and his wife on a news website, Walla, owned by the company. Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing.
If indicted, the four-term prime minister would be facing one of the greatest challenges to his political survival. Despite his dominance of Israeli politics, the newest police recommendation comes just after his right-wing coalition's majority was reduced to a precarious one seat in parliament.
The final decision on whether to indict rests with Israel's attorney-general, who is still weighing whether to charge Netanyahu in the other two cases.
Those relate to allegations that Netanyahu accepted gifts from businessmen and that he tried to strike a deal with a different media mogul for better coverage in return for curbs on a competing newspaper.
Most of Netanyahu's coalition partners have said they will wait for a decision by the attorney-general before making any decisions about how to react to the allegations.
Some analysts have said Netanyahu could call a snap vote in light of the legal proceedings against him. The next national election is not due until November 2019. But Netanyahu may want to seek a renewed mandate from the people, forcing a prosecutor to think twice before indicting him.
Netanyahu has said he wants his coalition to keep going until the end of its term, but politicians close to him say that given the coalition's shaky razor-thin majority, an early election is likely.
In Sunday's joint statement with the Israel Securities Authority, police said they also found sufficient evidence to charge Shaul Elovitch, a family friend of Netanyahu, with bribery.
At the time Elovitch was chairman and controlling shareholder of Bezeq. The authorities said there was also evidence to charge the company's then-CEO Stella Handler with fraud.
Elovitch and Handler have denied wrongdoing. They were both arrested and detained briefly earlier this year and have resigned from Bezeq.
In their statement, the authorities said: ""The main suspicion is that the prime minister took bribes and acted out of a conflict of interest by intervening and making regulatory decisions that favor Shaul Elovitch and Bezeq."" It alleged that Netanyahu sought to interfere with content of Bezeq's Walla website ""in a way that would benefit him.""
Netanyahu served as communications minister from 2015 to 2017.
The police also recommended that charges of fraud and breach of trust be brought against Netanyahu and his wife.
Shortly after the police recommendations were made public, Netanyahu issued a statement saying that the allegations had no legal basis and that ultimately nothing would come of the investigation.

""I am sure that also in this case the relevant authorities, after examining the matter, will reach the same conclusion - that there was nothing because there is nothing,"" he said.

CHICO, Calif. (Reuters) - Rebuilding Paradise, California, after it was leveled by fire three weeks ago will pose a new massive challenge to the devastated mountain community - starting with complicated insurance claims for nearly 14,000 lost homes.
At least 88 people were killed in the Camp Fire and nearly 200 others are still listed as missing, making the wildfire the deadliest in state history. Law enforcement officials say the search for remains in the ash and rubble has officially ended. 
Some of those who escaped the flames only to find themselves homeless are expected to be allowed to return to inspect their properties as early as next week. Many will find themselves essentially starting over, facing months or even years of rebuilding and seeking compensation for their losses.
Christopher Gregg, whose home in Paradise was a total loss, said he's not getting answers to the question of when he will be compensated by his insurance company.
""They say, 'We'll let you know as soon as we can.' Well, when can we get back on our feet, is my question. I'd like to know ... When do we get a chance to resume some portion of our lives?"" he said.
Insurance teams began gathering in Chico in the early days of the fire that erupted on Nov. 8 and rapidly engulfed Paradise about 20 minutes away and surrounding communities. 
Working out of truck trailers, temporary tents and recreational vehicles in mall parking lots, and equipped with generators and satellite communications, insurance adjusters say they have been stymied in part by a ban on flying drones over what is left of the town of 27,000.
Insurers responding to natural disasters typically use drones to obtain 360-degree views of damage when access is limited. But the drones have been restricted as crews work to clear downed trees and power lines, as well as burn debris and restore infrastructure.
BILLIONS IN LOSSES 
Pop-up insurance booths are a common site these days in California as it experiences its most destructive wildfire season on record. 
A total of 7,579 fires have burned some 1,667,855 acres, an area roughly the size of Delaware, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
Moody’s last week estimated total insured losses at $10-$15 billion from the Camp Fire and the Woolsey fire, which was burning at the same time in the foothills above Malibu in southern California.
Insurers say climate change is a factor in the more intense fire seasons and are raising rates or even dropping coverage.
""We're seeing these fires these last few years that people have defined as 1-in-500-year-type events ... Absolutely we're seeing some things change and climate change is playing a role in that,"" said Suzanne Meraz, spokesperson for CSAA Insurance Company. 
Insurers now often use computer models to generate house-by-house risk predictions, factoring in such features as local topography and brush cover instead of just using a more general history of blazes in a region.
Paradise resident Ed Riddle was focusing on one task at a time. His home is a total loss, confirmed by a friend who was able to take pictures. 
""I kind of feel like a turtle on its back looking for a rock,"" he said. 
Riddle said he would like to rebuild, but wasn't sure what that would look like. ""There are so many rumors about how long its going to take before we can."" 
He had been in touch with his insurer and already received some payments.

""I guess they're going to present me with some options whether to rebuild or not. I'm told I shouldn't make any decisions quickly about that,"" he said.

After offering to take more than 600 migrants rejected by Italy and Malta over the summer, Madrid said that rather than making the long journey to Spain, the boat should head to the nearest safe port. nL8N1TD3HI
“From the beginning, the government has worked to ensure the boat, which is in international waters, goes to a safe and nearby port,” Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo said in a statement on Sunday.
Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’s Socialists go to the polls on Sunday in a key regional election in Andalusia, the main entry point for migrants making the dangerous sea crossing to Spain. Immigration has been a major focus of the campaign, while a surging far right is predicted to win its first seats since the 1970s.
The fishing boat, Santa Madre de Loreto, rescued 12 migrants in international waters off the coast of Libya 10 days ago. Spanish NGO Proactiva Open Arms has been assisting the boat and migrants aboard, who it says would not have been safe if they were returned to Libya.
“The government now says #Santa Madre de Loreto should head to Malta. Late, wrong and unscrupulous. Playing with the security of people who have gone 10 days without news, amid a rough storm, and with one person rescued by helicopter and a high risk for the whole crew,” Oscar Camps, founder of Proactiva Open Arms, wrote on Twitter on Sunday morning.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin walked up to Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at a summit of G20 world leaders, high-fived him and then shook his hand heartily. Moments earlier the prince had been pictured on the far edge of the traditional ""family portrait"" photograph, ignored by other leaders.
The two moments captured the dilemma facing world leaders at the Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires this weekend: How to deal with the crown prince, who is dogged by controversy over the murder of a Saudi journalist but is also de facto leader of a rich, oil-producing kingdom that is a major global investor.
To be sure Putin's exuberant greeting of the prince was seen as over the top and promptly went viral. But, while leaders appeared to ignore Prince Mohammed on stage during the ""family photo,"" many went on to have closed-door bilateral meetings with him during the two-day summit.
The crown prince, facing a global outcry over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in a Saudi consulate in Istanbul six weeks ago, had conversations with at least 12 world leaders.
Three of them, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, British Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Emmanuel Macron, said publicly they had pressed Prince Mohammed for a full investigation into the murder.
Saudi Arabia has said the prince had no prior knowledge of the murder of the prominent Saudi journalist. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said the killing was ordered by the highest level of Saudi leadership but probably not from King Salman, putting the spotlight instead on the 33-year-old crown prince.
Trudeau said he had a frank conversation with the prince at a leaders' dinner on Friday, telling him there was ""a need for better answers on the killing of Khashoggi."" May said she called for a full, credible and transparent investigation, while Macron insisted the crown prince allow international investigators to take part in any inquiry.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who has defended U.S. ties with Saudi Arabia, ""exchanged pleasantries"" with the crown prince, the White House said. Trump has said it may never be known if Prince Mohammed ordered the killing or not. Sources say the CIA believes the crown prince ordered the killing.
NO DISCUSSION
The crown prince also discussed investments and economic partnerships with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Readouts of those meetings did not say whether Xi and Modi had confronted the prince over the Khashoggi case.
""China firmly supports Saudi Arabia in its drive for economic diversification and social reform, and will continue to stick together with Saudi Arabia on issues involving their core interests,"" Xi said, according to China's official Xinhua news agency.
Modi and Prince Mohammed discussed scaling up investments in India’s tech, farm and energy sectors, according to an Indian official and the Saudi news agency (SPA).
Before the start of the gathering, Argentinian President Mauricio Macri had said it was possible that the accusations against the crown prince could be discussed when the leaders convened.
In the end, they were not.
Days before the start of the summit, Human Rights Watch called on Argentina to use a war crimes clause in its constitution to investigate any involvement by the crown prince in possible crimes against humanity in Yemen, where a Saudi-led military campaign is under way, and Khashoggi’s murder.

The federal prosecutor's office assigned to review the case had not announced whether a formal investigation would be opened by the close of the summit on Saturday.

ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday he is likely to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in January or February and that three sites for their second meeting are under consideration.
""We're getting along very well. We have a good relationship,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on his return from a G20 summit in Argentina. 
Trump added that at some point he will invite Kim to the United States.
The two sides have been engaged in talks on the leaders' second meeting after the first, unprecedented, one in Singapore in June, Reuters reported in October, citing a senior official.
The White House said in a statement on Saturday after Trump's meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping that they and Kim will strive ""to see a nuclear free Korean Peninsula.""
The statement said Xi and Trump ""agreed that great progress has been made with respect to North Korea."" 
Last month, Vice President Mike Pence said Trump would push for a concrete plan outlining Pyongyang's moves to end its arms programs.
Pence told NBC News last month the United States would not require Pyongyang to provide a complete list of nuclear weapons and locations before the second summit, but that the meeting must produce a concrete plan.
""I think it will be absolutely imperative in this next summit that we come away with a plan for identifying all of the weapons in question, identifying all the development sites, allowing for inspections of the sites and the plan for dismantling nuclear weapons,"" Pence said.
Pence said last month it was essential that international sanctions pressure be maintained on North Korea until its complete denuclearization was achieved.
North Korea had been angered by Washington's refusal to ease sanctions and has warned it could resume development of its nuclear program if the United States did not drop its campaign.
A U.S. think tank said last month it had identified at least 13 of an estimated 20 active, undeclared missile bases inside North Korea, underscoring the challenge for American negotiators hoping to persuade Kim to give up his weapons programs.

North Korea had entered into agreements with regional powers in 1994 and in 2005 to dismantle its nuclear program in return for economic benefits and diplomatic rewards, but those deals broke down after Pyongyang clandestinely continued to pursue building weapons of mass destruction.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday condemned what he described as Iran's testing of a medium-range ballistic missile capable of carrying multiple warheads as a violation of the international agreement on Tehran's nuclear program.
Amid tension between Washington and Tehran over ballistic missiles, Pompeo warned in a statement released on Twitter that Iran is increasing its ""testing and proliferation"" of missiles and called on the Islamic Republic to ""cease these activities.""
President Donald Trump pulled out of an international nuclear agreement in May and reimposed sanctions on Tehran, criticizing the deal for not including curbs on Iran's development of ballistic missiles or its support for proxies in Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and Iraq.
Iran says its missile program is purely defensive but has threatened to disrupt oil shipments through the Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf, if the United States tries to strangle Iranian oil exports. Last month, an Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander said U.S. bases in Afghanistan, the UAE and Qatar, and U.S. aircraft carriers in the Gulf were within range.
Pompeo's statement provided few details about the latest Iranian missile test. 
""The Iranian regime has just test-fired a medium range ballistic missile that's capable of carrying multiple warheads,"" he wrote in the tweet. 
""This test violates UNSCR 2231,"" he added, citing the United Nations Security Council's endorsement of the international nuclear agreement. ""We condemn this act."" 
U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, addressing a security forum in California, said the Iranian launch was significant and was a reminder that Tehran was unlikely to be deterred from pursuing missile technology or supporting militant proxies.
""It shows that our best efforts to try to talk them out of their aggressive support of terrorism is probably going to be as unsuccessful as the U.N's effort to stop them from launching missiles,"" Mattis said. 
He added that while the strategic threat from Iran was less significant globally than the one from North Korea, he said it was regionally significant.
""And it could grow beyond that if it's not dealt with,"" Mattis said.
The Islamic Republic's government has ruled out negotiations with Washington over its military capabilities, particularly its missile program, which is run by the Revolutionary Guards.

On Tuesday, the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran warned the European Union that Tehran's patience was running out on the bloc's pledge to keep up oil trading despite U.S. sanctions. He said Iran could resume enriching uranium to 20 percent purity if it fails to see economic benefits from the 2015 deal that curbed its nuclear program.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - Aftershocks from Friday's powerful Alaskan earthquake continued to pound the area around Anchorage on Saturday, as workers strove to patch up buckled roads and residents began cleaning up damage around their homes and businesses.
The 7.0 magnitude quake struck Friday morning about 8 miles (13 km) north of Anchorage, the state's largest city with 300,000 residents, disrupting rush-hour traffic and jamming telephone service. There were no reports of serious injuries. 
“We are on the road to returning to normal,” Anchorage Mayor Ethan Berkowitz said at a news conference on Saturday. He credited the region's strict building codes with minimizing damage and preventing many injuries.
By Saturday, state transportation crews and contractors were already on scene to make closed roads usable as soon as possible, and the Anchorage School District said maintenance and recovery workers were assessing damage to school buildings to make sure they were safe, officials said.
The state late Saturday identified 47 earthquake-damaged roads and bridges, most of which cannot be fully repaired until the region's dark and snowy winter has passed. 
But even as cleanup began, as many as 650 aftershocks continued to rock the area, Alaska State Seismologist Mike West said in an interview. 
“It will take months for the rate of the aftershocks, the rate at which they’re occurring, to drop down to what you would consider background levels,” he said, although the vast majority were too small to cause damage.
In a letter to parents and staff, Anchorage School District Superintendent Deena Bishop said that ""many, if not all,"" schools sustained damage in the quake, and that it was securing its buildings to protect valuables that students and teachers left behind as they fled.
The district was aiming to reopen its schools by Wednesday.
The city is keeping a tally of costs associated with the quake, but did not yet have an estimate, said Municipal Manager Bill Falsey.
North of Anchorage, the Matanuska-Susitna Borough also sustained considerable damage, including the wreck of Vine Road. Most of the borough's schools will also be closed until Wednesday, the Matanuska-Susitna School District said. 
As of midday Saturday, there had been no serious earthquake-related injuries reported, and crews were working to set up detours around some heavily damaged roads, officials said.
Anchorage's Port of Alaska, which handles half the goods shipped to the state, is also being evaluated for damages, Falsey said. Workers there were in the process of unloading fuel from a tanker when the quake hit, Falsey said. 

The biggest transportation problem area is the sole route headed north from town, the Glenn Highway, Falsey said. Much of that highway was ripped apart in the quake, and motorists must detour around a damaged bridge, he said.

TBILISI (Reuters) - Georgia's new President-elect described Russia on Saturday as an unpredictable occupying power, staking out a tough line towards Moscow as she faces protests at home from opponents who accused her of being soft on Russia during the campaign.
Salome Zurabishvili, who has the backing of the ruling Georgian Dream party, won 59.5 percent of the vote in Wednesday's runoff. Her defeated opposition rival Grigol Vashadze has said he does not recognize her victory and has called for peaceful demonstrations on Sunday.
In an interview with Reuters on Saturday, Zurabishvili said there could be no point in any negotiations with Russia until it recognizes that it is occupying two breakaway Georgian regions.
Russia was an ""occupying power"", and the biggest concern was ""that it's unpredictable"", she said.
""When you have an enemy that is known and predictable you know what will be your next steps. In this case, to be very frank, I don't know what should be the next steps of Georgia in relations with Russia. It is so unpredictable and so overly present on our territory.""
Zurabishvili, who was born in France to a family of Georgian émigrés, served as a French career diplomat before becoming Georgia's foreign minister from 2004-2005, and will now be her country's first female head of state.
Under a revised constitution, the presidency is now largely ceremonial and the prime minister and government wield most executive power. But the position is still seen as important as the international face of the country, which aims to secure better relations with the West to counter Moscow's influence.
Russia fought and won a brief war against Georgia in 2008, after which Moscow recognized the independence of two Georgian breakaway regions, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Russia now garrisons troops in the two regions.
Moscow's role dominates Georgia's domestic politics, with rival parties accusing each other of being insufficiently firm in confronting it. In the run-up to the vote, Zurabishvili was criticized by opponents for comments that appeared to blame Georgia for causing the 2008 war.
Georgia is an ally of the United States in the South Caucasus region, and houses pipelines carrying Caspian oil and gas to Europe. It aims to join NATO one day.
Zurabishvili said she wanted Georgia to be seen ""not only through the Russian prism"", but as an ancient country that had a lot to offer to the rest of the world. Raising its profile on its own would in turn help Georgia counter Russia.
""To make Georgia more present is also a way to make Russia less influential in our relations with European partners,"" she said. ""I'm convinced that we can ask much more from our European partners ... and I intend to be a more demanding partner for Europeans as well as for our NATO partners.""
Zurabishvili said she would aim to use her new role to reconcile Georgia's divided society, but said the opposition's call for people to refuse to recognize the results of the election served Russia's interests. 

""That's exactly what Russia would have wished for - to have a very divided and very weakened country and a discredited president whose legitimacy is under attack,"" she said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis accused Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday of being a ""slow learner"" who again tried to meddle in U.S. elections in November, adding that he had no trust in the Russian leader.
    The remarks by Mattis at a security forum in California came a day after President Donald Trump held informal talks with Putin on the sidelines of the Group of 20 industrialized nations meeting in Argentina. Trump had scrapped a more formal meeting with Putin, citing Russia's treatment of Ukraine.
Asked if U.S.-Russian ties had become more strained since he took over the Pentagon last year after Trump became president, Mattis said, ""There's no doubt the relationship has worsened."" 
""(Putin) tried again to muck around in our elections this last month. And we are seeing a continued effort along those lines,"" Mattis said, adding that the United States would take whatever steps were necessary to defend American democracy.
American intelligence agencies concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election to sow discord and boost Trump's chances through a campaign of propaganda and hacking aimed at disparaging his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. A special counsel investigation into Russia's role in that election and whether Trump's campaign conspired with Moscow has cast a cloud over his presidency.
The comments by Mattis were the latest sign of deteriorating relations between Washington and Moscow. Russia has denied meddling. Trump has said there was no collusion.
Ahead of the Nov. 6 midterm congressional elections, U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials accused Russia of trying to influence the vote. U.S. prosecutors in October charged a Russian national with playing a financial role in a Kremlin-backed plan to conduct ""information warfare"" against the United States, including attempts to influence the midterm election. [nL2N1WZ19Q]
RUSSIA-UKRAINE TENSIONS
Russian forces opened fire on Ukrainian naval vessels last weekend and seized them and their crew near Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Mattis said those actions underscored why the international community was increasingly distrustful of Moscow.
""Mr. Putin is clearly a slow learner. He is not recognizing that what he is doing is actually creating an animosity against his people,"" Mattis said.
""What we are seeing Putin do with his ripping up of international agreements ... we're dealing with someone that we simply cannot trust,"" the Pentagon chief added.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders on Saturday confirmed Trump's encounter with Putin in Argentina in a statement, saying, ""As is typical at multilateral events, President Trump and the First Lady had a number of informal conversations with world leaders at the dinner last night, including President Putin.""
Speaking in Buenos Aires, Putin told reporters on Saturday there were no pre-conditions for future bilateral talks with Trump.
""It is regrettable that we can't succeed in holding a full-scale meeting, which is long due,"" Putin said, adding that issues of strategic stability would be of paramount importance. [nL2N1Y60M7]
   U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday said the Ukraine events were the only reason Trump canceled his planned formal meeting with Putin in Argentina, not developments in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.
The decision to scrap the meeting with Putin came shortly after Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty on Thursday to a charge of lying to Congress about a skyscraper project Trump was pursuing in Moscow during the 2016 U.S. presidential race. [nL2N1Y40PO]
""Ludicrous; Washington parlor game,"" Pompeo said in a CNN interview at the G20 meeting when asked whether Trump was motivated to cancel the meeting by Cohen's guilty plea.

The past few days have seen a sharp rise in tension in Lebanon, after video emerged of Druze politician Wiam Wahhab filmed at a gathering making obscene personal insults.
Although Wahhab did not name the target of his insults in the video, he was widely perceived as referring to Prime Minister Saad Hariri and his father Rafik, a statesman who was killed in 2005.
Hariri's allies filed a legal complaint, accusing Wahhab, an ally of the powerful Shi'ite group Hezbollah, of ""stirring strife and risking civil peace"" in the video.
The police, in a statement, said officers had gone to Wahhab's residence in the village of al-Jahiliya on Saturday ""with the aim of bringing him"" for questioning, but he had fled before their arrival.
It said police had not opened fire but unidentified gunmen had shot from neighboring buildings, and Wahhab supporters had fired ""randomly"", wounding one of the politician's aides.
Wahhab was quoted by news organization LBC International as saying one person was wounded in what he described as a clash.
""I was subjected today to an attempted assassination and the person who was wounded was meters from me. Let Hariri bear the responsibility of this blood,"" he told LBC International in comments reported on its Twitter feed.
Wahhab, referring to the video that sparked the legal complaint, said his remarks were ""general"" and not directed at Hariri's family. He criticized the security forces for arriving in large numbers, adding: ""What happened today means civil war"".
The police said a travel ban had been imposed on him.
Earlier this week Hariri supporters staged protests and blocked roads after Wahhab denounced Hariri as incompetent in a TV interview. Hariri's Future Movement has said the Hariris were being targeted by ""a campaign of falsehoods"" hatched by ""sick minds"" bent on obstructing efforts to form a new government.
Wahhab, who has close ties to the Syrian government, is a prominent figure in Lebanon, although another politician, Walid Jumblatt is the main leader in the Druze community which is guaranteed eight seats in Lebanon's 128-member parliament.
""We support any measure that firms up civil peace and it's enough that this person or anyone else threatens civil peace,"" Jumblatt said on Saturday after a meeting with Hariri.

Lebanon has suffered spasms of political crisis and violence since its 1975-90 civil war. Hariri leads a caretaker government but has been unable to form a cabinet since a May parliamentary election, with factions at odds over the division of posts.

Putin spoke with reporters on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Buenos Aires. Russia is resisting international calls to release three Ukrainian naval ships that its border patrols fired upon and seized in the strait near Russian-annexed Crimea last weekend.
Moscow accused the 24 sailors of illegally crossing the Russian border. 
Putin said he would not introduce tit-for-tat restrictions on the entry of Ukrainians into Russia after Kiev imposed a ban on Russian males aged 16 to 60 from entering its territory.
After U.S. President Donald Trump canceled a planned meeting with Putin at the G20 summit, citing the military tensions with Ukraine, the Russian leader said there were no pre-conditions for future bilateral talks.

Trump's administration has accused Russia of non-compliance with the 31-year-old Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty and has said it will pull out of the deal as a result. The Kremlin denies violating the pact.
""This is related to the issues of strategic stability, especially after the president declared his desire to withdraw from the INF missile treaty,"" Putin added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Saturday condemned Venezuela's socialist President Nicolas Maduro as a despot leading his oil-rich nation to ruin, adding ""ultimately this regime is going to have to go"" for the situation to improve.
However, Mattis did not suggest any U.S. role in such a process and told a security forum in California: ""It's up to the Venezuelan people, it's up to the regional states in that area to help expedite that and bring that country back to a more prosperous and positive future.""
More than 3 million Venezuelans have fled the ailing oil-rich nation in recent years, driven out by brutal food and medicine shortages, hyperinflation, and violent crime.
Washington has imposed sanctions on Venezuela, denouncing Maduro for quashing human rights and triggering an economic meltdown.
""This is what happens when you have an irresponsible despot leading a country to ruin. And I think what we should do is work by, with and through our Latin American allies as we stabilize this situation,"" Mattis told the Reagan National Defense Forum.
He noted that the Comfort, a U.S. Navy hospital ship, was treating Venezuelan refugees on a Latin American tour that included stops in neighboring Colombia.
""We’re doing our best diplomatically and through humanitarian aid. But ultimately this regime is going to have to go,"" he said.
The United Nations on Monday pledged $9.2 million in aid for Venezuela, where hunger and preventable disease are soaring due to food and medicine shortages. Maduro blames the country's problems on U.S. sanctions and an ""economic war"" led by political adversaries. 
Government critics celebrated the U.N. pledge as a recognition by Venezuelan authorities that the country faces a humanitarian crisis - something Maduro has denied in the past - and a step toward treating a population starved of basic services.

But some worry the funds could fuel the corruption of the ruling Socialist Party, which was put on display earlier this month when a former Venezuelan treasurer told U.S. prosecutors he took $1 billion in bribes.

May sealed a deal with EU leaders last Sunday that would see Britain leave the bloc on March 29 with continued close ties, but the odds look stacked against her getting it approved by a deeply divided British parliament.
The deal has been criticized by many of May's Conservative lawmakers, both supporters of a cleaner break with the EU and those who want to keep closer ties. Opposition parties and a small Northern Irish party which props up May's minority government have also said they plan to reject the deal.
Several of her ministers have resigned in protest at the deal, and some of her lawmakers have called for a confidence vote in her leadership, something some believe could happen if she loses the vote in parliament.
""There is a lot more for me still to do, not least delivering on Brexit and being the prime minister that does take the United Kingdom out of the European Union,"" May told a news conference at the G20 Summit in Argentina, when asked what her legacy would be if she is forced to quit.
She said the next nine days were an important time for the country, ahead of a Dec. 11 vote in parliament on her deal.
""I will be talking with Members of Parliament ... and explaining why passing this deal in the vote that will take place in the House of Commons will take us to certainty for the future, and that failure to do that would only lead to uncertainty.""
May, who discussed trade with the leaders of Australia, Canada, Chile, Turkey and Japan on the sidelines of the summit, said she had heard from other leaders about the need for that certainty.
Earlier, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe urged May to ensure stability as Britain leaves the EU and asked her to do what she could to avoid a 'no deal' Brexit. 
May said that during her meetings with world leaders she had updated them on the Brexit deal and told them it would be a good deal for the global economy as well as international firms which have invested in Britain or that use European bases to supply the UK market.
""That this deal sets a path for the UK to a brighter future has been affirmed by the discussions I have had on trade over the past two days,"" she said. 

""Friends and partners have made clear that they are keen to sign and implement ambitious free trade agreements with us as soon as possible,"" she added.

ALGIERS (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will arrive in Algeria on Sunday for a two-day visit, Algerian state news agency APS said, resuming his tour of Arab countries after the G20 summit in Argentina.
Before the G20 summit the heir to the throne of the world's top oil exporter visited the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Egypt and Tunisia. 
It is his first trip abroad since the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which has strained Saudi Arabia's ties with the West and battered the prince's image abroad.
Saudi Arabia has said the prince had no prior knowledge ofthe murder. After offering numerous contradictory explanations,Riyadh said last month that Khashoggi had been killed and hisbody dismembered when negotiations to persuade him to return toSaudi Arabia failed.
Algerian-Saudi investments and trade relations such as the oil and petrochemical sectors would be discussed, APS said.
Algeria's energy minister Mustapha Guitouni said last week that global oil prices would not be on the agenda.
Algeria is one of the few Arab countries which has good relations with Saudi Arabia as well as its arch rival Iran.
Algiers also has strong ties with Qatar, with which Saudi Arabia and three other Arab states severed trade and transport ties in June 2017. The four accused Doha of supporting terrorism and Iran - charges Doha denies.
Algerian army chief of staff Ahmed Gaed Salah will not join the meetings with the Saudi heir as he is visiting Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, according to his ministry.
The North African OPEC member is also on good terms with Turkey, whose relations with Saudi Arabia have been strained by the Khashoggi killing.
The Saudi prince is unlikely to face protests over the murder like he did in Tunisia, as demonstrations are banned in Algiers.
But a group of prominent journalists and intellectuals has issued an open letter protesting against his visit, saying it was ""unethical and politically inappropriate"".

There was no confirmation that the prince might also visit Algeria's neighbour Morocco, despite speculation in the local press. The Moroccan foreign ministry refused to comment.

""I have read every piece of intelligence that is in the possession of United States government,"" Pompeo said in an interview with broadcaster CNN in Buenos Aires on the sidelines of the G20 summit.
""When it is done, when you complete that analysis, there's no direct evidence linking him to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. That is an accurate statement, an important statement and it is a statement that we are making publicly today,"" he said.
Asked if the Central Intelligence Agency had concluded with ""high confidence"" that Prince Mohammed, de-facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, was involved, Pompeo said: ""I can't comment on intelligence matters, CIA conclusions.""
The CIA has assessed that the crown prince ordered the Oct. 2 killing at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul of Washington Post columnist Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi crown prince.
Saudi Arabia has said the prince had no prior knowledge of the murder. After offering numerous contradictory explanations, Riyadh later said Khashoggi had been killed and his body dismembered when negotiations to persuade him to return to Saudi Arabia failed.
U.S. President Donald Trump sought to cast doubt on the CIA assessment that the prince ordered Khashoggi's killing, telling reporters the agency had not formed a definitive conclusion. [nL2N1XV120]
Many U.S. senators have said they believed otherwise. [nL2N1Y311J]

Pompeo said the United States was working with Saudi Arabia in Afghanistan and against Iran and that Riyadh was ""an enormous support"" for Washington. ""They're a relationship that has mattered for 70 years across Republican and Democrat administrations like ... We're aiming to keep that relationship,"" he said.

235,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2018 12:03PM ET</span>","Mexico leftist takes power, torn between principles and pragmatism","By Dave Graham and Diego Oré
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Veteran leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador assumes the Mexican presidency on Saturday vowing to champion the poor and contain business elites he says have conspired with politicians for years to fuel corruption and lawlessness. 
After a busy five-month transition that has spooked financial markets, Lopez Obrador will just before midday take responsibility for fixing escalating gang violence, chronic poverty and widespread discontent with the political class in Mexico.
To do that, the anti-establishment former Mexico City mayor plans to increase pensions, create a militarized Guardia Nacional nationwide police force, change the penal code to amnesty lesser criminals, and hold referendums to back his policies.
An admirer of Mexican President Lazaro Cardenas, who nationalized Mexico's oil industry in 1938, Lopez Obrador will be the first leftist to run the country since it began moving from one-party rule toward democracy in the 1980s. 
Thanks to a landslide victory and a coalition that controls both houses of Congress, he enters office as one of the most powerful presidents in decades.
The 65-year-old took a conciliatory approach to investors during the campaign, but has struggled to reconcile deeply held personal ideals with his pragmatic acknowledgment that he needs a stable economy and investment to achieve his goals.
He also wants to improve ties with U.S. President Donald Trump by crafting a deal to contain migration from Central America in exchange for U.S. aid to help develop the violent, impoverished region.
""Mexico is going to be a safe country, a country that really encourages investment,"" he said in a video address this week, promising his inauguration speech would be business-friendly.
But also this week, he stepped up threats to undo outgoing President Enrique Pena Nieto's agenda, slamming the latter's ""neo-liberal"" opening of the oil industry to foreign capital.
Growth has been sluggish under Pena Nieto, and Sergio de la Cruz, a 37-year-old Lopez Obrador supporter in Mexico City, said he expected the economy to struggle at first.
""The country needed a change,"" said de la Cruz, the owner of a newspaper stand. ""Now there will be an end to corruption because there's going to be an honest leader.""
But Roberto Hernandez, a 68-year-old security guard in the city's Roma district, was already bracing for disappointment.
""All the presidents are the same. They make promises, they get in and when it comes to it, they do nothing,"" he said. ""They'll never end corruption. He's surrounded himself with the same people as always - they're all tainted.""
ROLLER-COASTER
The months since the election have been a white-knuckle ride for investors. Markets gyrated to abrupt decisions backed by what Lopez Obrador calls participatory democracy, but what critics see as autocratic populism.
On Oct. 29, he canceled a $13 billion new Mexico City airport, alleging a taint of corruption, leading investors to dump shares, bonds and the peso currency.
Though it has since pared some of those losses, the Mexican bourse is still close to three-year lows.
Lopez Obrador, who long opposed the airport, justified the decision with an opaque referendum his party organized in which barely 1 percent of the electorate voted. He said the cancellation sent a message there would be a clear division between political and economic power in Mexico.
He has since doubled down on referendums, while reacting sharply to criticism, fueling concerns in some corners he may push the country in a more partisan direction.
Juan Carlos Romero Hicks, lower house leader of the opposition center-right National Action Party (PAN), said Mexico needed to brace for uncertainty in months ahead, arguing Lopez Obrador had ""lost touch with reality."" 
Some of the toughest problems Lopez Obrador faces are more severe than when Pena Nieto took office in 2012 vowing to tackle unprecedented violence. Like his predecessor, the new president says security will be his top priority.
More than 25,000 murders, a record, were logged in 2017. But over 10,000 were registered between July and October, the bloodiest four-month period since modern records began in 1997.
Lopez Obrador enters office with more support than Pena Nieto, according to a Nov. 23-25 survey by polling firm Consulta Mitofsky published on Friday.
Mitofsky said 62.6 percent approved of his performance as president-elect compared with 56.4 percent for Pena Nieto, whose popularity later plunged to record lows after a series of corruption scandals and his failure to curb gang violence.
But the poll also hinted at divisions.
Some 34.7 percent disapproved of the job Lopez Obrador had done in the transition, a more skeptical assessment than Mexicans gave the three previous presidents.
A clash with a G20 summit in Buenos Aires means few leaders from major powers will attend Lopez Obrador's inauguration. 

Latin American left-wing presidents, including Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro, Cuba's Miguel Diaz-Canel and Bolivia's Evo Morales, feature prominently. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Trump's daughter, Ivanka, will also attend.

236,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2018 11:39AM ET</span>",Former President George H.W. Bush dies; oversaw end of Cold War,"By Bill Trott
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tributes to former U.S. President George H.W. Bush, who died at the age of 94, poured in from around the world on Saturday as global leaders honored him for his role in helping to end the Cold War and reduce the danger of nuclear annihilation. 
Bush, the 41st president of the United States who possessed one of the most impressive resumes in American political history, also routed Saddam Hussein's Iraqi army but lost his chance for a second term after breaking a no-new-taxes pledge.
""Many of my memories are linked to him,"" said Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, with whom Bush signed a strategic arms reduction treaty that scaled back the two countries' nuclear arsenals. 
""We happened to work together in years of great changes. It was a dramatic time demanding huge responsibility from everyone,"" Russia's Interfax news agency cited Gorbachev as saying. 
U.S. President Donald Trump paid tribute in a statement to his predecessor's ""essential authenticity, disarming wit, and unwavering commitment to faith, family and country."" 
Trump added that Bush ""inspired generations of his fellow Americans to public service - to be, in his words, 'a thousand points of light' illuminating the greatness, hope and opportunity of America to the world.""
Bush's death at 10:10 p.m. CST Friday (0410 GMT Saturday) was first announced in a brief statement issued by longtime spokesman Jim McGrath. No further details about the circumstances of his death were immediately available.
The White House said a state funeral is being arranged with all of the accompanying support and honors at the National Cathedral in Washington. The president, who plans to attend the funeral with first lady Melania Trump, also designated a national day of mourning on Wednesday, Dec. 5, and ordered the lowering of the American flag for 30 days. 
Bush was the father of former President George W. Bush, who served two terms in the White House in the 2000s, and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who unsuccessfully sought the 2016 Republican nomination for president. Like his sons, he was a Republican. 
His death came seven months after that of his wife, former first lady Barbara Bush, to whom he was married for 73 years. He was admitted to a Houston hospital with a blood infection that led to sepsis a day after her funeral in April. 
""The entire Bush family is deeply grateful for 41's life and love, for the compassion of those who have cared and prayed for Dad, and for the condolences of our friends and fellow citizens,"" George W. Bush said in a statement.
A U.S. naval aviator during World War Two, the elder Bush also served as vice president for eight years during Ronald Reagan's two terms as president, before being elected to the White House himself. He lost his 1992 presidential re-election bid to Democrat Bill Clinton. 
""His ethos of public service was the guiding thread of his life and an example to us all,"" said British Prime Minister Theresa May. ""In navigating a peaceful end to the Cold War, he made the world a safer place for generations to come.""
Russian President Vladimir Putin said Bush ""faithfully served his country all his life - with a gun in his hand during the war years and in high government roles in peace time,"" according to Russian state news agency TASS.
EXTENSIVE POLITICAL RESUME
George Herbert Walker Bush, a Connecticut Yankee who came to Texas to be an oilman, died as the patriarch of a Republican political dynasty. His son George Walker Bush was president from 2001 to 2009, making them only the second father and son to hold the office, after John Adams (1797-1801) and John Quincy Adams (1825-1829).
His second son, Jeb, undertook his own campaign for the presidency in 2015 before dropping out in February 2016. Bush's father, Prescott Bush, was a U.S. senator from Connecticut.
Bush had first sought the presidency in 1980, campaigning on experience gathered as a U.S. congressman from Texas, envoy to China, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, United Nations ambassador and chairman of the Republican National Committee.
Ronald Reagan, the former actor and California governor, vanquished Bush in the Republican primaries but chose him as his running mate, hoping Bush's reputation as a moderate would balance his own hard, conservative image.
After two terms in the Reagan White House, Bush ran for the presidency again in 1988 and defeated Massachusetts Democrat Michael Dukakis by winning 40 of the 50 states.
The high points of Bush's presidency included the end of the Cold War, which brought the dissolution of the Soviet Union and its hold on former Eastern Bloc countries including Poland. 
""He was the only one of the world leaders at the time (who) did so much to overcome communism and help Poland,"" said Lech Walesa, the former head of Poland's independent trade union, Solidarity, who led protests and strikes that shook communist rule in the 1980s.
""He will remain in hearts and memory forever,"" Walesa said via Twitter, describing Bush as ""Poland's Great Friend.""
Bush also won a decisive victory over Saddam's Iraqi army in 1991, along with the soaring popularity it brought him at home, and made progress on Middle East peace.
""If you travel around the world today, you find his reputation in the Middle East, the Far East, in China, is still remarkably high,"" former British Prime Minister John Major, Bush's contemporary in power, told the BBC. 
But Bush's foreign affairs victories were overshadowed by a stagnant economy at home. He broke his ""read my lips"" pledge not to raise taxes and lost his 1992 re-election bid to Clinton.
Bush, who was born on June 12, 1924, in Milton, Massachusetts, grew up wealthy, attending elite schools but putting off college so he could enlist in the Navy at 18. He flew 58 missions off aircraft carriers in World War Two and survived being shot down over the Pacific Ocean.
After returning from the war, he married Barbara Pierce, with whom he would have six children. After he graduated from Yale University on an accelerated schedule, the Bushes headed to the oil fields of West Texas.
It was there that Bush became involved in politics, first losing a U.S. Senate race in 1964 before winning election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1966. 
After two terms and another failed Senate bid in 1970, he was appointed by President Richard Nixon as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. In 1974, President Gerald Ford made him an envoy to China and later director of the CIA.
Bush did not endorse fellow Republican Trump, the eventual winner of the 2016 presidential election who attacked both Jeb and George W. Bush during his campaign. He did not publicly say whom he voted for in the election, but a source told CNN he went for Trump's Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.

Bush did send Trump a letter in January 2017 saying he would not be able to attend his inauguration because of health concerns, but wishing him the best.

Russia opened fire on and seized three Ukrainian navy ships and their crews on Nov. 25 in an incident which Moscow and Kiev have blamed on each other, triggering a crisis that has raised fears of a wider conflict.
Poroshenko on Saturday repeated allegations that Russia had amassed a large military force in eastern Ukraine, which is controlled by pro-Russian separatists, and in Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.
""(Russia) has deployed land forces of around 80,000 Russian troops, about 1,400 artillery and missile systems, 900 tanks, 2,300 armored vehicles, about 500 planes and 300 helicopters,"" Poroshenko wrote on Twitter.
Moscow had also built up a powerful naval force in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, which Russia and Ukraine share, he said.
Ukrainian TV channel ""112 Ukraine"" on Saturday showed Poroshenko presenting new and overhauled military aircraft, helicopters and drones to the Ukrainian army. 
Ukraine had stepped up security at critical infrastructure sites, including at nuclear and hydroelectric power plants, chemical factories and at ports on the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, Poroshenko said.
Ukraine has introduced martial law in parts of the country for 30 days, and Poroshenko said on Saturday military reservists in those areas would practice mobilizing and that military factories would be changing the way they worked too. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed last weekend's Black Sea clash as a minor border incident and accused Poroshenko of engineering what he called a ""provocation"" to boost his flagging popularity before an election next year.
Russian politicians have also said they believe the military phase of the confrontation is over.
The incident took place near the Kerch Strait between Russian-annexed Crimea and southern Russia, which controls access to the Sea of Azov, location of both Russian and Ukrainian ports. Moscow says Ukrainian navy ships entered Russian waters while trying to cross the strait without prior notice, ignoring orders to stop. Kiev says its ships should need no Russian permission to cross the strait.

Russia's state TASS news agency cited pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine on Saturday as saying they had observed a large inflow of Ukrainian military forces nearby.

238,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2018 09:55AM ET</span>",Pakistan to press terrorism charges against leaders of hardline Islamist group,"By Syed Raza Hassan
KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistan's government on Saturday announced it will press terrorism and sedition charges against leaders of a hardline Islamist group that staged recent protests across the country. 
The leader of the Tehreek-e-Labbaik (TLP) party, Khadim Hussain Rizvi, and several senior figures were detained last month after they shut down major cities in protest at the acquittal of a Christian woman who had spent eight years on death row on blasphemy charges. 
One of the TLP co-founders called for the killing of the Supreme Court judges who acquitted Asia Bibi, as well as the overthrow of the government and the powerful army chief, General Qamar Javed Bajwa.
Pakistani Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said Rizvi had been ""charged under sections of sedition and terrorism"" in a police station in the eastern city of Lahore. Three other senior TLP figures are facing the same charges.
""Today we have decided to take legal action against the TLP leadership,"" Chaudhry told a press conference. 
""All those who were directly involved in destroying property, who misbehaved with women, who set fire to buses, are being charged under laws of terrorism at different police stations.""
The move represents a hardening of the authorities' stance toward the group, which in late 2017 paralyzed the capital Islamabad for several weeks and clashed with the police in deadly protests.
CONCESSIONS
In 2017 and last month TLP members called off protests after negotiating with the military and reaching a deal with the government, which made many concessions to appease the group. When Rizvi was finally detained, authorities said he was not arrested, but merely put in ""protective custody"".
Chaudhry said more than 3,000 TLP members were taken into protective custody in the wake of the protests.
The TLP, whose main focus is protecting Pakistan's draconian blasphemy laws, was founded out of a movement supporting a bodyguard who assassinated Punjab provincial governor Salman Taseer for advocating for Bibi in 2011. 
Blasphemy is a deeply emotive issue in Pakistan's staunchly religious society, and officials have been unnerved by how much support Rizvi's TLP has garnered across the country in the two years since the group entered mainstream politics.
Information Minister Chaudhry said Rizvi's deputy, Afzal Qadri, was also charged over terrorism and sedition, along with senior TLP leaders Inyatul Haq Shah and Hafiz Farooq ul Hassan.
Qadri shocked many Pakistanis last month when he called for the overthrow of the army chief, an unthinkable comment in Pakistan where the military is rarely criticized in public and the army normally does not tolerate such dissent.
""Sedition has a sentence of life imprisonment, they can face life imprisonment. All the charges will be submitted before courts,"" Chaudhry said.

Tensions between the federal government and state authorities have mounted in recent weeks after Mogadishu tried to block the candidacy of former al Shabaab Islamist militant Mukhtar Robow.
""After the committee evaluated the many activities awaiting, available time and the incomplete tasks to be completed within a short time frame..., (it) decided the election date will be 19 December,"" a committee statement said. 
The original date for the election was Nov. 17 before its initial postponement to Nov. 28 and then to Dec. 5.
South West is slated to be the first of Somalia’s seven semi-autonomous regions to hold presidential elections in the coming months, a critical juncture in a growing power struggle between the central government in Mogadishu and the states. 
The postponement in South West state came a day after the central government deployed dozens of federal police officers to Baidoa, the state capital, to help ""tighten security"", said Hassan Hussein, South West state security minister. 
Further deployments would be made to help prevent al Shabaab destabilizing the election, Hussein told reporters on Friday. 
""There is an election and what is required is an election to take place peacefully. The enemy al Shabaab often tries to terrify the peace of South West state,"" Hussein said. 
Somalia has been trying to claw its way out of the remnants of the civil war that engulfed it in 1991, when clan warlords overthrew a dictator and then turned on each other. 
Al Shabaab has been fighting for more than a decade to topple the weak central government and implement its interpretation of Islamic law. 
In November, over half South West's election committee resigned, accusing the central government of interfering in the vote and attempting to install their preferred candidate. 
Matt Bryden, head of the Nairobi-based think tank Sahan Research, said there were legitimate technical issues surrounding the vote, but that the delay and police deployment were making the situation increasingly tense. 
""The situation is increasingly unpredictable and I wouldn't even rule out the risk of violence in the coming days. And if that happens, then the situation could develop in any direction,"" Bryden told Reuters.

""Also, I would like to once again ask for your support to avoid no deal as well as to ensure transparency, predictability as well as legal stability in the Brexit process,"" he added, speaking through a translator.
May has warned British lawmakers that if they reject the agreement, Britain could leave the EU with no deal, a step which businesses fear could disrupt their supply chains.
May told Abe the agreement offered ""a good deal for businesses in the UK, including the many Japanese companies who have made significant investment into the UK and who will be able to continue, on the basis of our deal, to trade well with the European Union from the UK"".

Both leaders said they looked forward to working more closely together on trade in the future, including the possibility of Britain joining the Comprehensive and Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).

After Catalonia declared independence last year, Madrid took direct control of the region and brought charges including misuse of public funds and rebellion against Catalan leaders, nine of whom are in jail awaiting trial.
Two of the leaders in custody -- Jordi Sanchez and Jordi Turull -- announced in a joint statement that they had started refusing food to protest at the failure of Spanish courts to process numerous appeals in relation to their cases.
""We are not asking the court for special treatment. But we will not passively accept discrimination or unwarranted delays,"" the two men said in the statement.
Sanchez told Reuters in an interview last week that he was convinced he would not get a fair trial in Spain, but believed he and other separatist leaders would be acquitted by the European Court of Human Rights.
A Spanish government spokesperson said the jailed separatists would get a fair trial. ""Only the judiciary is responsible for sentencing,"" the spokesperson added.
Tensions with Madrid have cooled since last year but the Catalan government continues to advocate for a referendum on leaving Spain, something the Spanish government has said it will not accept.

Labour finance spokesman John McDonnell was quoted in Saturday's Times as saying there would be no bartering with Sturgeon to win the support of her Scottish National Party (SNP) lawmakers.
""We wouldn’t have a deal with other political parties,"" he said. ""We believe we will win the next election with a handsome majority.""
Speculation about a possible deal with the SNP has grown since Sturgeon held talks with the Labour leadership last month in London to identify common ground on an alternative to Prime Minister Theresa May's plan for leaving the European Union.
May faces fierce opposition in parliament to her plan and political analysts have said she might even step down if she is decisively beaten in a vote on the issue due on Dec. 11.
The independence-minded SNP, the ruling party in Scotland's devolved legislature in Edinburgh, have 35 seats in Britain's 650-seat lower house of parliament.
The price of their support for a Labour government would likely be an end to May's block on a second Scottish independence referendum after the 2014 vote in which Scots voted to remain in the United Kingdom.
McDonnell said that even if Labour failed to win a majority in any general election it would form a minority government if it ended up being the largest party.

""We will bring forward our transformative program and if other parties support it that’s up to them,"" he added.

244,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>",EU document says Czech PM in conflict of interest over Brussels funds,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Billionaire Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis has a conflict of interest over EU funds received by companies in which he is a beneficiary and should cut ties with the firms, according to a European Commission legal opinion seen by Reuters.
Babis, who before becoming premier in Dec. 2017 served as finance minister since 2014, denied any wrongdoing on Saturday following publication of media reports about the confidential document, which is meant to inform decisions by the European Union's executive.
The legal opinion said ""the situation of Mr Babis qualifies as a conflict of interest,"" which could require the reimbursement of EU funds and should be remedied by severing links to the involved companies.
It said Babis was the ""sole beneficiary"" of two trusts into which shares of Agrofert and the Agrofert group were transferred.
The companies, through a network of dozens of agriculture, chemical and food-processing businesses, received EU funds worth 82 million euros ($92 million) in 2017 and many more in previous years.
""I'm in no conflict of interest, I act strictly by the law,"" Babis told Reuters on Saturday.
""I don't control or direct the trust funds, because I don't even have time for it, being fully occupied by the prime ministerial job,"" he said, adding that he had not seen the European Commission legal opinion. 
The document, however, said that even if he were not in a position of control, the situation would still qualify as a conflict of interest ""because he has an interest in the economic success"" of those companies.
It suggested the setting up of a blind trust as a way to end the conflict of interest, but underlined that Czech authorities were primarily in charge of taking action.
Babis and his family should ""sever all relations"" with the two companies to address his conflict of interest, the opinion said. Babis' wife is one of the beneficial owners of the trust funds and sits in the board that oversees their management, the EU legal document says.
A spokesman for Agrofert said the company had no information about any investigation and had not been contacted about the matter.
""We will wait for an official statement from the European Commission. Andrej Babis did everything that the Czech legal system required,"" the spokesman added.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Employees of Indian company Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) taken hostage by local staff in Ethiopia fear for their safety, with some being confined to a company campus north of the African nation's capital Addis Ababa. 
India has asked Ethiopian authorities to investigate and help the seven IL&FS employees who say they are being held by local staff due to non-payment of salaries by the debt-laden firm, an Indian government official said on Saturday. 
A group of four employees has not been allowed to leave an IL&FS campus in Bure town, 400 km (250 miles) north from Addis Ababa, since Nov. 24, said store manager Nagaraju Bishnu, one of the employees held hostage. 
Two other IL&FS employees were held hostage by local staff in the town of Woliso and one in Nekemte town, both of which are west of the Ethiopian capital, Bishnu told Reuters by telephone. 
""The main gate is locked, they are observing our movement,"" said 26-year-old Bishnu, speaking of the situation at Bure. 
""They've told us until they get their salaries, we can't move from here ... We are facing sleepless nights."" 
The Indian government took control of IL&FS in October after it defaulted on some of its debt, triggering wider concerns about risk to the country's financial system. 
The infrastructure financing and development company had over the years developed roads, townships and water-treatment projects in India and abroad. 
An official at India's foreign ministry said the government was discussing the matter ""on priority"" with Ethiopian authorities and the management of IL&FS. 
""We are doing our best to ensure a settlement of this matter,"" said the official, who declined to be identified.
An IL&FS spokesman in India, Sharad Goel, declined to comment. Ethiopian government officials in Addis Ababa could not be reached for comment. 
LOW ON WATER SUPPLIES
With the ordeal widely reported by media, Bishnu said he feared the local staff would take away their mobile phones or cut online access to restrict them from talking to colleagues or communicating via e-mails and social media. 
For now, Bishnu said, he has been speaking with the IL&FS employees held hostage in different areas, and the movement of employees within the camp has not been restricted. 
The employees are cooking their own food, eating potatoes and rice, although drinking water supplies are running low.
""After tomorrow, there will be no drinking water,"" he said.
Some of the seven employees being held have been posting messages on social media website Twitter, asking Indian politicians including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the foreign minister to intervene.

Neeraj Raghuwanshi, who said he was one of the seven, late on Friday wrote an ""SOS"" message on Twitter saying: ""Situations are beyond our control, please #help before mishappening.""

246,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2018 05:50AM ET</span>","Pakistan lawmakers critical of army barred from leaving the country, briefly detained","By Jibran Ahmad and Saad Sayeed
PESHAWAR/ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (Reuters) - Two lawmakers who are vocal critics of Pakistan's powerful military and have alleged widespread abuses by the armed forces say they have been barred from leaving the country, in the latest crackdown on dissent in the South Asian nation. 
Ali Wazir and Mohsin Dawar, two parliamentarians from the violence-ravaged North Waziristan region bordering Afghanistan, were due to leave for United Arab Emirates on Friday, when authorities at the airport in the northwestern city of Peshawar intercepted them and briefly detained them. 
""Both of us are on the ECL,"" Dawar told Reuters, a reference to the Exit Control List, which names people forbidden from leaving Pakistan. 
Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), which is in charge of the ECL list and whose officials stopped the lawmakers in Peshawar, did not respond to requests for comment. 
But an FIA source confirmed Wazir and Dawar were both on the list, ""so they can't leave the country."" 
Rights groups and media owners say the military, which has ruled Pakistan for nearly half its history, is increasingly restricting free speech and curtailing the work of civil society groups, something the army has denied. 
The FIA source said a First Information Report (FIR), which marks the formal opening of a criminal investigation, has been opened against the two lawmakers for making ""anti-state"" speeches. In practice, such charges are usually levied only when the criticism centers on the military. 
""The police in Swabi had lodged cases against them for their anti-Pakistan speeches in a public gathering there,"" the FIA source said, referring to a city 100 km (60 miles) east from Peshawar in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. 
Wazir is the co-founder of the Pashtun ethnic rights movement, the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM). Dawar was one of the leaders of PTM before the July elections, when they were both elected to parliament as independent candidates. 
The PTM alleges that thousands of Pashtuns were targeted in state-organized killings after Pakistan joined the U.S.-led war on terror in 2001 and launched major military operations against militant strongholds in tribal areas by the Afghanistan border between 2009 and 2014. The army denies the claims. 
The military has been engaged in talks with PTM members, but the two sides are far apart on agreement over the grievances of PTM members. 
The FIA source said Wazir and Dawar were both briefly detained by the police and will face court hearings or further police investigations.

247,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2018 03:40AM ET</span>",Iran navy launches stealth warship in the Gulf,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran's navy on Saturday launched a domestically made destroyer, which state media said has radar-evading stealth properties, as tensions rise with arch-enemy, the United States.
In a ceremony carried live on state television, the Sahand destroyer -- which can sustain voyages lasting five months without resupply -- joined Iran's regular navy at a base in Bandar Abbas on the Gulf.
The Sahand has a flight deck for helicopters, torpedo launchers, anti-aircraft and anti-ship guns, surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles and electronic warfare capabilities, state television reported. 
U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of an international agreement on Iran's nuclear program in May and reimposed sanctions on Tehran. He said the deal was flawed because it did not include curbs on Iran's development of ballistic missiles or its support for proxies in Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and Iraq.
The United States has said its goal is to reduce Iran's oil exports to zero. Senior Iranian officials have said that if Iran is not allowed to export then no other countries will be allowed to export oil through the Strait of Hormuz at the mouth of the Gulf.
""This vessel is the result of daring and creative design relying on the local technical knowledge of the Iranian Navy... and has been built with stealth capabilities,"" Rear-Admiral Alireza Sheikhi, head of the navy shipyards that built the destroyer, told the state news agency IRNA.
Iran launched its first locally made destroyer in 2010 as part of a program to revamp its navy equipment which dates from before the 1979 Islamic revolution and is mostly U.S.-made. 
Iran has developed a large domestic arms industry in the face of international sanctions and embargoes that have barred it from importing many weapons.
Separately, a naval commander said Sahand may be among warships that Iran plans to send on a mission to Venezuela soon. 
""Among our plans in the near future is to send two or three vessels with special helicopters to Venezuela in South America on a mission that could last five months,"" Iran's deputy navy commander, Rear-Admiral Touraj Hassani Moqaddam, told the semi-official news agency Mehr.
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said last week Iran should increase its military capability and readiness to ward off enemies, in a meeting with Iranian navy commanders.
Iran's navy has extended its reach in recent years, launching vessels in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden to protect Iranian ships from Somali pirates operating in the area. 
The chief of staff of the Iranian armed forces said in 2016 that Iran may seek to set up naval bases in Yemen or Syria in the future, raising the prospect of distant footholds perhaps being more valuable militarily to Tehran than nuclear technology.

ANTANANARIVO (Reuters) - Madagascar's president, Hery Rajaonarimampianina, conceded defeat in his bid for a second term after managing a distant third in the first round of voting in the island's presidential vote. 
Rajaonarimampianina got just 8.82 percent in the November first round, the High Constitutional Court said on Wednesday, behind former presidents Marc Ravalomanana, who got 35.35 percent, and Andry Rajoelina, who got 39.23 percent.
He will not take part in the second round, due on Dec. 19. The court rejected his request to have the election canceled.
""The people’s choice must be respected,"" Rajaonarimampianina said in a televised statement late on Friday. 
""If this is not respected, the authorities that will come after will not be stable.""
Madagascar is hoping for a second peaceful election since upheaval in 2009, when Ravalomanana was forced out of office by protests led by Rajoelina in what the African Union and other international organizations said was a coup.
Total voter turnout was 53.95 percent of registered voters.
Rajaonarimampianina said he would not endorse any of the remaining candidates and appealed for calm.
""I wish that this second round will bring peace and stability to our country,"" he said. 

""We have all seen the irregularities during the first round. The Malagasy (people) hope that this will not happen during the second round.""

249,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2018 01:10AM ET</span>",U.S. to send observers to Bangladesh election amid opposition concerns,"By Zeba Siddiqui and Serajul Quadir
DHAKA (Reuters) - The United States will send 12 teams of observers and fund thousands of domestic observers to monitor an election in Bangladesh it hopes will be free and fair, a senior official at the U.S. embassy in Dhaka said.
Amid opposition concerns about rigging in the Dec. 30 general election, there has been speculation about U.S. plans for it, especially after the European Union this week said it would not send observers, nor comment on the vote or result.
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is seeking a third straight term.
Her old rival, Khaleda Zia, who leads the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, is in jail after being convicted on charges she says were politically motivated. Scores of BNP workers have also been detained.
The BNP boycotted the last election, in 2014, as unfair, but has said it will take part this time, though it is seeking international monitors of polls it says it believes will be flawed.
The United States is sending a dozen teams, each of about two observers, who will fan out to most parts of the country, William Moeller, political officer at the U.S. embassy in Dhaka, told Reuters. 
""The Bangladesh government has emphasized that it plans to hold a free and fair election,"" Moeller said this week.
""We welcome that and are providing funding for election observers who hope to see such an outcome.""
Moeller referred to reports of harassment and intimidation before recent city corporation elections, which he said may have suppressed voter turnout.
“We raised these concerns at the time, so we are hoping we won’t see the same issues in the national elections.”
The U.S. National Democratic Institute said after an assessment in October the polls would be held ""amid a high degree of political polarization, heightened tensions and shrinking political space”.
The Bangkok-based Asian Network for Free Elections will send a team of about 30 short- and long-term observers, Moeller said. 
About 15,000 Bangladeshi observers will be funded jointly by the U.S. Agency for International Development, Britain's Department for International Development and the Swiss government, he said.
The domestic observers would spread out but might not be able to reach every polling station, he said.
PLAYING DOWN WORRIES
Hasina and Khaleda have alternated in power over the last 28 years. Elections in Bangladesh are often violent and marred by ballot-stuffing and voter intimidation.
Hasina's Awami League has held power since 2009 and dispensed from 2014 with a practice of letting a neutral caretaker government oversee elections, to the anger of the BNP.
The government has brushed off opposition fears of rigging.
""I don’t see any possibility this time, because all the parties are participating, and all of them will have their election agents,” said HT Imam, a political adviser to Hasina.
Bangladesh has seen steady economic growth under Hasina and the development of a vibrant garment sector under-pinning export growth, and accounting for 80 percent of the economy. 
But rights groups have criticized increasing curbs on freedom of speech and the media.
Hope to capitalize on dissatisfaction, the BNP has formed an alliance with smaller parties called the National Unity Front and Hasina said this week she expected competitive polls.
The EU delegation in Dhaka said it was not sending observers because of growing demand for them amid tight resources.
India had no plan to send observers unless Bangladesh asked, an official at the Indian High Commission said.

250,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2018 12:27AM ET</span>",Lost idol: New wave of Myanmar youth activists look beyond Suu Kyi,"By Shoon Naing and Poppy McPherson
YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar youth activist and television host Thinzar Shun Lei Yi would once have called herself one of Aung San Suu Kyi's greatest fans. Now, she is one of her most vocal critics.
The 27-year-old belongs to a small but high-profile group of liberal activists, many former die-hard Suu Kyi supporters, who are growing increasingly disillusioned with the administration they voted into power with sky-high hopes three years ago.
""I lost my idol, I'm confused, frustrated and lost,"" said Thinzar Shun Lei Yi, who hosts an 'Under 30' talk show on a popular local website.
""Most of the activists and youths are now thinking: 'What is next', 'What will happen?', 'What can we do?' At this stage, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi is going her own way and nobody can intervene, and she won't listen to civil society organizations,"" she said, using the honorific for women in Myanmar.
While Suu Kyi continues to inspire devotion among many ordinary Burmese, the emergence of a dissenting youth movement – driven by anger over her handling of ethnic minorities, including the Muslim Rohingya, as well as curbs on the media and civil society – presents a new challenge for her administration.
At stake is the future of Myanmar's transition towards democracy after years of military rule. With a general election looming in 2020, the country's first civilian government in decades is confronted by growing divisions among activists who once coalesced around her National League for Democracy party.
NLD spokesman Myo Nyunt said the party was trying to win over young people, increasing the budget for education and supporting vocational training programs.
""The youth and the people expected a lot from our government,"" he said. ""We couldn't live up to their expectations, we admit. But we are doing our best.""
Suu Kyi took power in 2016 after a landslide election win, vowing to continue democratic reforms and end the country's long-running civil wars.
Since then, the administration has come under pressure over its response to a military crackdown against the Rohingya minority that the United Nations has described as ""ethnic cleansing"" with ""genocidal intent"", as well as faltering peace talks with ethnic armed groups and a stagnating economy.
FREE SPEECH
Activists say the civilian government has also become increasingly authoritarian, failing to use its overwhelming parliamentary majority to scrap colonial-era laws used to stifle dissent, while tightening restrictions on civil society. 
In recent months, they have staged several protests, including an anti-war march in the commercial capital of Yangon in May that ended in scuffles. A total of 17 people were charged with unlawful protest, including Thinzar Shun Lei Yi. Their trial is ongoing.
""Sensitive issues are banned, and protesters arrested and beaten,"" she said. ""The National League of Democracy, the party using the name of democracy, must respect democracy and human rights.""
According to free speech organization Athan, which means 'Voice' in Burmese, 44 journalists and 142 activists have faced trial since the Suu Kyi government took power.
The group's founder, poet and activist Maung Saung Kha, is one of them. He was also among the protesters charged alongside Thinzar Shun Lei Yi in May. Four months later, in September, they both helped organize another demonstration, this time for free speech. 
Facing the crowd, Maung Saung Kha – who is still an NLD member – donned the orange shirt traditionally worn by his party's lawmakers and draped a green jacket resembling military garb over it. Armed with a copy of the state-run daily newspaper The Mirror, he began beating journalists gathered nearby. 
""The government has failed to use its power to protect people's rights,"" he told Reuters. 
Myo Nyunt, the party spokesman, said the government was cooperating with non-governmental organizations, but their activities needed to be examined case-by-case.
""If it is not related to security or not a divisive issue among ethnics, we accept them,"" he said. ""We are going forward to democracy so we acknowledge the role of NGOs, but we have concerns that NGOs are being influenced by sponsors instead of being independent.""
""ACKNOWLEDGE ROHINGYA""
While she has no control over the military, Suu Kyi has faced international criticism for failing to defend the Rohingya, more than 730,000 of whom fled a sweeping army cracking in western Rakhine state in 2017, according to U.N. agencies. The crackdown was launched in response to insurgent Rohingya attacks on security forces.
Myanmar denies almost all the allegations of atrocities made by refugees, saying the army was carrying out a legitimate campaign against terrorists.
While many among Myanmar's Buddhist majority revile the Rohingya, the young activists offer a rare sympathetic voice.
""We acknowledge Rohingya. We totally denounce the fact that they are referred to as 'Bengali',"" said Maung Saung Kha, referring to a term commonly used in Myanmar to imply the Rohingya are interlopers from Bangladesh, despite a long history in the country.
""We haven't seen any acknowledgement or punishment for the things that happened,"" he said. ""The refugees will not come back as long as these people think of them as less than humans, and that it is not a crime to kill them.""
Khin Sandar, another young activist facing unlawful protest charges, spent months campaigning for the NLD ahead of the 2015 election but lost faith in Suu Kyi over her handling of the Rakhine crisis. 
Her family was affected in a wave of communal violence in 2012, when not only Rohingya but members of the Kaman Muslim minority, who also face discrimination but unlike the Rohingya are considered Myanmar citizens, were driven from their homes. They live in crowded internal displacement camps outside the Rakhine state capital Sittwe and are subjected to severe restrictions on movement.
In a speech after last year's violence, Suu Kyi said all residents of Rakhine ""have access to education and healthcare services without discrimination"".
""My own nephew and nieces are still living in the Sittwe camps and they don't have those rights,"" said Khin Sandar. ""I was shocked. How can she say that in her speech?"" Afterwards, she said, she quit her job as researcher for an NLD lawmaker.
While the youth activists represent only a small segment of Myanmar society they are increasingly influential in the grassroots activism scene, while their protests and public comments have attracted significant attention from media and from their vast social media followings.
Mostly in their 20s and 30s, they highlight the gulf between Myanmar's young population – the median age is 27 – and its ageing leadership, comprised of mostly men in their 60s and 70s.
""Myanmar is a very conservative country, these young people especially from Yangon are now challenging that,"" said Myat Thu, a political analyst from the Yangon School of Political Science.

""In order to have a revolution of ideas, not many people need to know. They will spread it gradually.""

TIJUANA, Mexico (Reuters) - Hundreds of mostly Central American migrants poured into a new shelter on Friday as bus loads fled a filthy, flooded sports complex on the eve of a presidential inauguration in Mexico that could recast the border crisis with U.S. President Donald Trump.
Earlier in the day, streams of migrants laden with heavy backpacks, tents and blankets, much of it soaking wet, loaded buses leaving their original migrants shelter within sight of the border.
Helicopters swooped down nearby a few times and lines of people formed quickly when bottles of water were passed out. Diapers and milk for children were also distributed.
For those among the at least 6,000 migrants who have descended upon the Mexican border city of Tijuana, just south of San Diego on the U.S. side, the move to a former outdoor concert venue after torrential rains a day earlier reduced the old shelter to a muddy, smelly mess was a welcome relief.
""Here it's better,"" said Victor Manuel Argeta. 
The 44-year-old native of Usulutan, El Salvador, spoke alongside his wife and two children as he surveyed the limited indoor space while many other caravan migrants set up simple camps in an open square in the middle of the property.
""It's dry. We have a dry blanket. They gave us mattresses, too,"" said Argeta.
He said he joined the caravan to find better job prospects in the United States. 
Many of the migrants who made the trek to the East Tijuana property, some 7 miles (11 km) from the border, appeared thankful to be out of the muck even if most will sleep on thin mattresses on a cold, hard floor.
Jorge Alberto Lobo, 21, also from El Salvador, was eager to leave the old shelter as he packed up his few belongings.
""I have the dream, I think we all had it, to get to the other side, to the United States,"" he said, but quickly adding that if he does not make it he will likely stay put in Mexico and look for work.
'RESPECT'
On Saturday, Mexico's leftist president-elect, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, will take the oath of office in the capital as he seeks to make good on campaign promises to alienate poverty and inequality, in part to help stem the flow of Mexico's own migrants.
The former mayor of Mexico City has welcomed the caravan migrants in speeches, pledging to offer work visas and even jobs building a major train line he has proposed.
The day before his inauguration, Lopez Obrador was resting with friends at this ranch in southern Chiapas state, near the border with Guatemala, and reaffirmed his support for the migrants.
""Progressive (NYSE:PGR), democratic governments respect migrants, respect the right all of us have as human beings to search out a better life. It's the most important human right,"" he said in a video posted on Twitter.
He made a point of reflecting on the history of migrants north of the border.
""The United States is a country that became a powerhouse because of the work, effort and intelligence of migrants,"" he said. 
Trump, conversely, has dubbed the migrants an invading force that must be stopped, even threatening to shut the U.S. border if Mexico does not deport those gathered in Tijuana.

To date, Mexican officials have ignored the threat.

The North Korean soldier was spotted moving toward South Korea, and then crossed over a military demarcation line separating the two sides, the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said in a statement.
The defection took place after the two Koreas removed guard posts along the border in an effort to build trust on the divided peninsula.
Such defections are rare but there have been several over recent years, sometimes raising tension on the heavily fortified border. North Korean soldiers have even shot at defecting colleagues, raising fears of a clash.
The JCS said the soldier would be investigated and there were no unusual movements on the border.

PARIS (Reuters) - French authorities have drafted thousands of additional police officers into Paris ahead of a third demonstration on Saturday by protesters angry at high fuel prices as security officials warned of renewed violence.
For more than two weeks, the ""yellow vests"" have blocked roads across France in a spontaneous, popular rebellion against diesel tax hikes and the high cost of living. It has grown into one of the largest and most stubborn challenges Emmanuel Macron has faced in his 18-month-old presidency.
A week ago thousands of protesters, who have no leader and have largely organized themselves online, converged on Paris for the first time, turning the Champs Elysees into a battlezone as they clashed with police firing tear gas and water canon.
""We're worried that small groups of rioters that aren't yellow vests will infiltrate (the demonstration) to fight security forces and challenge the authority of the state,"" said Denis Jacob, Secretary General of the Alternative Police union.
""Given the high level of security around the Champs the fear is thugs will go to other places,"" he said. 
Officials said they expected some 5,000 police and gendarmes in Paris, up from about 3,000 last Saturday. Another 5,000 will be deployed across the country for other yellow vests protests.
Workmen erected metal barriers and plywood boards on the glass-fronted facades of restaurants and boutiques lining Paris' most famous avenue on Friday. The Champs Elysees will be closed to traffic and pedestrians will be funneled through checkpoints.
""There's a lot of incitement on social media and we are expecting excess and violence,"" David Michaux of the UNSA Police union told Reuters, adding that far-right and far-left groups were expected.
Three protests are officially planned across Paris on Saturday, including the ""yellow vests"", a union protest against unemployment and a separate demonstration against racism.
For now, the ""yellow vests"" -- who take their name from the high-visibility jackets all motorists in France must carry in their vehicles -- enjoy widespread public support.

When they began, the protests caught Macron off-guard just as he was trying to counter a plunge in popularity, with his approval at barely 20 percent. His unyielding response has exposed him to charges of being out of touch with ordinary people.

LONDON (Reuters) - British science and universities minister, Sam Gyimah, quit Prime Minister Theresa May's government on Friday, the sixth minister to resign in protest of her proposed Brexit deal with the European Union.
Gyimah, a junior-ranking minister who campaigned in the 2016 vote to keep Britain in the EU, said May's deal meant Britain would surrender its ""voice and its veto"" and that the prime minister should not rule out the prospect of a second referendum.
His resignation represents a further blow to May, who is trying to persuade her own lawmakers to approve the deal she struck with Brussels on Sunday. 
May faces criticism from all sides including the Northern Irish party propping up her government, ahead of Britain's departure from the EU in four months. 
""It has become increasingly clear to me that the proposed deal is not in the British national interest, and that to vote for this deal is to set ourselves up for failure,"" Gyimah wrote in a resignation statement published by the Daily Telegraph newspaper. ""We will be losing, not taking control of our national destiny.""
Gyimah did applaud the ""grit and determination"" of May, who is in Buenos Aires attending a Group of 20 summit.
Earlier on Friday, May conceded that Britain will not use the EU's Galileo space project for defense or critical national infrastructure, following a row over the post-Brexit future of the planned rival to the U.S. Global Positioning System.
""Galileo is only a foretaste of what's to come under the government's Brexit deal,"" Gyimah said in his statement.

World Patent Marketing was a fraud, one angry person wrote in September 2016. ""What you don't know is how many people were scammed by him (Chief Executive Scott Cooper) and how fraudulent they are and how much money they robbed from people,"" wrote the person whose email was disclosed along with more than 300 pages of other materials released by the Federal Trade Commission.
The documents paint a picture of a company that heard from angry clients, and some of the emails or responses to them were also sent to Whitaker. It was unclear if he took any action to determine if the complaints were warranted.
Democrats have complained for several reasons about President Donald Trump's appointment of Whitaker as acting attorney general after Jeff Sessions was forced out this month.
Representative Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the U.S. House of Representatives Oversight Committee, said the documents released on Friday suggested Whitaker was aware of potential fraud.
""If true, this is extremely troubling and raises serious concerns about his fitness to serve as acting Attorney General and whether he was properly vetted for this critical position,"" he said in a statement.
World Patent Marketing, accused by the government of bilking millions of dollars from consumers, admitted no fault but settled with the FTC for more than $25 million earlier this year. Whitaker was not named in that complaint.
The hundreds of pages of documents released on Friday also show the FTC struggled to get in contact with Whitaker, who earned $9,375 for being on WPM's advisory board.
In March 2017, FTC attorney Colleen Robbins emailed two colleagues to say Matt Whitaker ""has not returned any of my calls.""
The FTC, which won a preliminary injunction against the company in August, subpoenaed Whitaker on Oct. 6 but again got no response.
Later that month, one FTC lawyer emailed colleagues to say: ""You're not going to believe this. ... Matt Whitaker is now chief of staff to the Attorney General of the United States.""
In a voicemail left for an FTC attorney that was made public on Friday, Whitaker said he was unaware of the subpoena sent to his former law firm, explaining he was in a new job as the chief of staff to then U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Whitaker began that job on Oct. 4, 2017.
""I want to be very helpful,"" he said in the voicemail, which was also released on Friday.
Whitaker subsequently spoke by telephone to FTC investigator James Evans on Oct. 24. Evans' notes from that telephone call show that Whitaker denied responding to ""consumers,"" presumably clients of World Patent Marketing.
In the call, Whitaker described his role as minimal. He said he forwarded any phone calls or emails to WPM CEO Cooper and never met with anyone else on the advisory board.

Evans also says in the email that Whitaker told him that any documents he had would likely be covered by attorney/client privilege.

The case is embarrassing for Austria, which has some of the closest relations with Russia in the European Union. Moscow denies any involvement in the case, which was made public this month and was uncovered after a tip-off from Britain.
""He has already been arrested,"" the prosecutors' office in Salzburg, where the recently retired colonel lives, said in a statement.
A court in Salzburg initially dismissed the prosecutors' arguments that he posed a flight risk and might re-offend if he was not remanded in custody. After his release they appealed to a separate court, which on Friday ordered his arrest.
The details of the ruling were, however, being kept confidential due to the sensitivity of the investigation, the statement added. The colonel, whom they did not name, remains under investigation.
Austria chose not to join the majority of EU states that expelled Russian diplomats over the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Britain. Moscow had denied British accusations of involvement in the nerve-agent attack.

258,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2018 03:35PM ET</span>",Swiss cabinet opposes move to curb EU immigration in referendum,"By John Miller
ZURICH (Reuters) - The Swiss government said on Friday it opposed curbing immigration from the European Union as proposed in a planned referendum because a yes vote could harm exports to the country's biggest trade partner.
The 28-nation EU now insists its citizens be allowed to live and work freely in non-member Switzerland in exchange for enhanced Swiss access to the bloc's single market.
Anti-immigration members of the Swiss People's Party (SVP), the largest party in parliament, have pushed to end that free movement on the grounds that it leaves the country without adequate tools to manage its growing population and encroaches on its sovereignty.
A referendum must be held on the matter as the required number of signatures has been gathered, but it remains unclear how much support such a proposal might garner in a nationwide vote. No date for the vote has been set.
The seven-member cabinet, in an opening salvo urging voters to reject curbing immigration from the EU in the referendum, said approving it would hurt Swiss efforts to attract qualified workers, stunt economic growth by crimping exports and raise the prices consumers pay for EU imports.
""Cancelling the free movement of people would fundamentally call into question the bilateral path for Switzerland and Europe,"" Justice Minister Simonetta Sommaruga told a news conference in Bern. 
The SVP launched its drive to get a referendum held on the issue after compromise-minded lawmakers in 2016 stopped short of requiring quotas on European immigration that voters had demanded two years earlier.
If the referendum motion is passed, it would require Switzerland to unilaterally cancel free movement if the country is unable to negotiate a waiver with the EU within 12 months. 
In urging opposition to that, Sommaruga said immigration from the European Union to Switzerland has already slowed to levels not seen in more than a decade, which she called a sign the country is now competing with other European nations for workers. 
Last year, net EU immigration to Switzerland was around 34,000, shy of record years like 2013 when 66,000 more people came from the EU than left. For 2018, net EU immigration through October was 26,809, Sommaruga said.
SVP President Albert Roesti called Sommaruga's focus on the slowdown disingenuous, given that in 2000 -- the year the free movement pact with Europe won Swiss voters' support -- the government had forecast far fewer Europeans would come annually.
""That's an immigration lie, because the Swiss cabinet at one time was talking about only 8,000 people,"" said Roesti, whose party is parliament's strongest at 29.4 percent representation. 
""This year, too, tens of thousands are coming,"" he added. ""When Europe's economy weakens, pressure will increase massively, and we won't have any instruments necessary to steer that.""

A quarter of Switzerland's 8.4 million residents have foreign passports. Since 2002, when freedom of movement took effect, Roesti said, Switzerland has added 700,000 EU citizens.

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (Reuters) - A photojournalist who took a Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph of the car plowing into a crowd of counterprotesters during a white nationalist rally in Virginia last year said in court on Friday that no image in the series showed its brake lights on.
""I heard screeching tires and an engine revving as it sped past me up the street,"" Ryan Kelly said, testifying at the trial of James Fields Jr., the white nationalist behind the wheel of the gray Challenger car that struck the victims, killing one and injuring 19 others. 
""It was faster than any car I've seen on that street. It was speeding, going directly into that crowd,"" Kelly said.
Fields, 21, faces 10 charges for his role in the violence at the ""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville in August 2017, including for the murder of Heather Heyer, a counterprotester killed when the car struck, which was captured in widely seen videos. 
Field says he acted in self-defense, terrified by the crowds near his car.
One of the victims, Jean Peterson, entered the courtroom with assistance and using a cane.
She said the moments before she was hit by the Challenger was a ""celebratory and convivial"" gathering of friends, as she described the group of counterprotesters she was with.
Then she felt two bumps going over her legs. The car was speeding over her. She said she remembered thinking that she ought to push herself out of the street.
""My legs wouldn't work,"" Peterson said. She is due for her sixth surgery soon, she testified. ""I was a fast walker,"" she added sadly. 
Hundreds of white nationalists had gathered in Charlottesville to protest the planned removal a statue honoring the U.S. Civil War-era Confederacy from a public park. At a rally the night before the incident, they carried torches and chanted anti-Semitic slogans.
Responding after the violence, U.S. President Donald Trump said there were ""very fine people on both sides,"" drawing criticism from Democrats and fellow Republicans for equating the white nationalists with those who demonstrated against them. 
Hours before driving into the crowd, Fields was photographed carrying a shield with the emblem of a far-right group, although the group later denied he was a member.
The government contends that Fields' killing of Heyer was pre-meditated murder, which he denies. His trial is expected to last three weeks. 
Tay Washington testified that she was caught up in crowds as she drove her car into downtown Charlottesville.
""I've never seen so many white people standing up for black people,"" Washington, who is black, told the jury. ""It was a 'wow' thing."" 
Then there was noise, commotion, and a body landed on the hood of her car.

She hit her head on her steering wheel ""and then kind of blacked out,"" she said.

He said China and Panama were ""natural partners"" to cooperate on China's ""Belt and Road"" initiative, a Chinese government strategy to build global infrastructure projects.

Putin's friendly behavior toward the crown prince contrasted sharply with that of other leaders at the Buenos Aires summit, amid suspicions of his possible involvement in the killing of Saudi journalist Jamalco Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October.
Saudi Arabia has said the prince had no prior knowledge of the murder, which has sorely tested the kingdom's relations with the United States, other Western nations and Turkey.
Earlier, Prince Mohammed was sidelined during the official ""family photo"" of world leaders at Friday's gathering and was largely ignored. He then quickly exited the stage without shaking hands or talking with the other leaders. 
Russia has refrained from criticizing Saudi Arabia or the crown prince over the killing. Putin said in October he lacked information about the matter and said Russia would not tear up its relations with Saudi Arabia because of it.
However, Moscow has also fostered strong ties with Saudi Arabia's regional arch foe Iran. Russia and Iran back President Bashar al-Assad in Syria's civil war, while Saudi Arabia along with Western countries have backed some rebel groups.
Putin and Prince Mohammed are due to hold bilateral talks on Saturday, according to Kremlin documents seen by Reuters.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries as well as Russia and other leading oil producers will meet in Vienna on Dec 6-7 to discuss further steps on the oil market as prices have been declining due to oversupply.

Riyadh has suggested OPEC and its allies reduce output by 1 million barrels per day from January 2019 to stem the price falls.

The trip by Londono, who now heads the FARC's political party and is better known by his nom de guerre Timochenko, marks the first time he has attended an inauguration.
The 2016 peace deal between the government and Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) put an end to the group's role in more than five decades of war in the Andean country that killed 260,000 people and displaced millions.
Londono's trip was approved by the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) tribunal, which is tasked with trying FARC and military leadership for human rights violations and war crimes.
Londono, 59, is allowed to remain outside of Colombia between Friday and Dec. 4, the tribunal said in a statement. 
He traveled to Mexico City for the Saturday ceremony with another former guerrilla after being invited by Mexico's Labor Party, which is part of Lopez Obrador's coalition.

The FARC debuted as a political party in March legislative elections, receiving just 50,000 votes. It has 10 legislative seats guaranteed to them through 2026 under the peace deal.

Around 300 people chanting anti-government slogans gathered near a parking lot where police had imposed a cordon to prevent them from marching to the office of Prime Minister Omar Razzaz.
Scores chanted ""Go away Razzaz!"", ""Government of robbers!"" and accused the government of failing to tackle high-level corruption and to end the squandering of public funds.
Jordan's mainly pro-government parliament approved a new IMF-backed tax law nearly two weeks ago that imposes steep tax hikes to narrow the record public debt and help get the economy, hit by conflict in the region, back on track. 
King Abdullah replaced the government in June after its push to impose an earlier tax bill led to a rare wave of protests, only a few months after hefty tax hikes were imposed on basic commodities. That tax bill was reworked into the new bill that parliament has now approved.
Popular discontent has in recent weeks grown with the Razzaz government. Many say that it has introduced only cosmetic changes to the earlier tax law and has failed to deliver on pledges of cutting waste and curbing corruption.

Many politicians and economists blame the IMF-inspired austerity plan Jordan is undertaking for worsening the plight of poorer people and squeezing the middle class while widening disparities between the rich and poor.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - A Kenyan charity held a pageant on Friday for people with albinism in a bid to affirm the dignity of a group that has faced discrimination, violence and even murder because of the hereditary condition.
The competition for 30 participants was organized by the Albinism Society of Kenya with partners in Uganda and Tanzania. The winners of Mr and Miss Albinism will get cash prizes and act as ambassadors for the partner organizations for a year.
Albinism is a rare, non-contagious, genetically inherited condition that leads to a lack of pigmentation in the hair, skin and eyes, causing vulnerability to the sun and bright light, according to the United Nations. 
The condition is said to be more prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa than elsewhere. The United Nations estimates 1 in 1,400 people are affected in Tanzania and 1 in 1,000 in Zimbabwe.
People with albinism have been attacked or even killed in some African countries for their body parts because of a belief that they possess magical powers.
The pageant, which aims to overcome that stigma, was titled ""accept me, include me, I can"".
Okwii Simon Peter, a 26-year-old Ugandan lawyer, said he was taking part to demonstrate that living with albinism does not make him different.
""We are here mainly to create awareness, to do advocacy ... showcasing our beauty and talent,"" he told Reuters.

Valencia Bosibori, 25, a customer care executive at a telecom firm in Kenya took part in a similar event held in 2016 that was open only to Kenyans. She said she wanted to ""reach people who don't have that knowledge of what albinism is.""

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Thursday she was focused on persuading lawmakers to back her EU divorce deal at a vote in parliament on Dec. 11 rather than preparing a plan B, accusing opponents of trying to betray voters over Brexit.
May secured an agreement with European Union leaders on Sunday that will see Britain leave the bloc on March 29 with continued close trade ties, but the odds look stacked against her getting it through a deeply divided British parliament.
The deal has been criticized by both euroskeptics and europhiles among May's own Conservative Party. Opposition parties and the small Northern Irish party which props up May's minority government have said they plan to vote against it.
""The focus of myself and the government is on the vote that is taking place on Dec. 11. We will be explaining to members of parliament why we believe that this is a good deal for the UK,"" May told reporters on the plane to the G20 summit in Argentina when asked if she had a back-up plan.
""I ask every member of parliament to think about delivering on the Brexit vote and doing it in a way that is in the national interest and doing it in a way that is in the interests of their constituents because it protects jobs and livelihoods.""
May has said if lawmakers in parliament's House of Commons reject the agreement it could see the world's fifth-largest economy leaving the bloc without a deal, or not leaving at all.
On Wednesday, the Bank of England warned Britain risked suffering an even bigger hit to its economy than during the global financial crisis 10 years ago if it leaves the EU in the worst-case, no-deal Brexit scenario.
May said if her plan was voted down by parliament the government and businesses would have to make decisions about implementing preparations for no deal.
Asked in a BBC interview if she would seek a second vote, she declined to answer directly, repeating her comment that she was only focusing on the Dec. 11 vote. 
FRUSTRATING BREXIT
Parliament will begin five days of debate on Dec. 4, with the final vote due a week later. The main opposition Labour Party and a cross-party group of senior lawmakers have put forward amendments to block May's EU withdrawal deal and to rule out a no-deal Brexit.
""Sadly, what we see from the Labour Party (is) their various attempts to frustrate Brexit and frustrate this vote,"" May told the BBC. ""What I see from Labour is an attempt to frustrate what the government is doing to deliver Brexit for the British people. That is actually a betrayal of the British people.""
Pro-EU politicians hope rejection of the deal could pave the way for a second referendum. Lawmakers who back a clean break with the EU hope that if the deal is rejected, May will go back to Brussels to seek further concessions. 
In the strongest comments yet that the bloc was unwilling to renegotiate further, European Council President Donald Tusk said the proposed deal was the best one possible.
""If this deal is rejected in the Commons, we are left with ... an alternative: no deal or no Brexit at all. I want to reassure you that the EU is prepared for every scenario,"" he told a news conference in Argentina on Friday. 
Trade Minister Liam Fox said May's attempts to win over Britons by touring the country to sell her deal was working.
""The prime minister has been changing the public mood, if you look at what's been happening in polling there's clearly a shift there,"" Fox said.
May has faced questions as to why she is spending time selling her deal to the public rather than the lawmakers who will vote on it.
""We will be doing plenty of engagement in the coming days with colleagues to set out the merits and virtues of our case,"" a senior source in her Conservative Party said. ""In the lead up to what is a crucial vote, you will see more of that.""
In the meantime, May will push the case for reform of the World Trade Organization at the G20 summit of industrialized nations on Friday and Saturday, including increasing transparency, updating dispute settlement processes and promoting trade in services and digital alongside goods.
""We will take our independent seat at the WTO next year when we leave the European Union and we do see the need for reform,"" she told reporters on the plane. 
May is only the second British prime minister to travel to Argentina and the first to visit Buenos Aires, with whom Britain fought a war in 1982 over the British-ruled Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic which Argentina claims.

Britain is expected to announce that it will create a post of trade envoy to Buenos Aires following talks between May and Argentine President Mauricio Macri.

269,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2018 12:35PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Sri Lanka president weighs backing down in crisis over parliament - sources,"By Shihar Aneez and Ranga Sirilal
COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena is considering dropping an attempt to dissolve parliament, sources close to the president said, possibly easing weeks of political deadlock.
The country has been in a crisis since Sirisena replaced Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe with Mahinda Rajapaksa last month, and then issued an order dissolving parliament and called for a general election.
The sources said the president may now rescind the order, effectively pre-empting a court ruling that they expect to overturn his decision anyway.
Sri Lanka's top court stayed the dissolution order pending a hearing on its constitutionality that starts on Tuesday, allowing parliament to resume meeting.
Rajapaksa, a former president, has lost two confidence votes in parliament but has refused to resign.
""There is a possibility of withdrawing the gazette,"" said a source in regular discussion with Sirisena, referring to the official announcement by which the president dissolved parliament. ""I have no doubt that the Supreme Court would say that dissolution was wrong."" 
A spokesman for Sirisena, Dharmasri Ekanayake, said he was unaware of any such plans.
""DIGNIFIED EXIT""
A second source in Sirisena's party said the president was looking for a ""dignified exit"" by withdrawing the dissolution order as the court was unlikely to rule in his favor.
The Supreme Court is expected to announce its decision as early as Dec 7.
Foreign countries have yet to recognize the new government. The impasse has also pushed the island's currency to record lows, caused turmoil on its stock and bond markets, and raised fears it may not be able to service debts to finance reconstruction following a 26-year civil war that ended in 2009.
Rajapaksa is seen as a hero by many among Sri Lanka’s Buddhist majority for ending a bloody war with Tamil rebels in 2009, but has been accused by diplomats and international rights groups of human rights abuses, which he denies.
Sirisena came to power in 2015 on a pledge to uphold democracy and stamp out corruption, but his popularity has been hit by a crisis many say he triggered because of personal differences with former Prime Minister Wickremesinghe. 
The crisis deepened on Friday when parliament voted to halt payment of ministers' salaries - a move to pressure the disputed government of Rajapaksa. Rajapaksa loyalists boycotted the vote saying it was illegal.

Separately on Friday, the country's Appeal Court began a hearing on a petition signed by 122 legislators that challenged Rajapaksa's authority to hold office after he lost the no confidence votes earlier this month.

Far-right success elsewhere in Europe was long unthinkable in Spain, seen as inoculated by the memory of Francisco Franco's dictatorship, which ended only with his death in 1975.
But polls predict that could change with Sunday's vote in the southern region, Spain's most populous and a left-wing stronghold for decades.
The far-right Vox party could win up to five seats in the regional legislature, according to a poll of polls by El Pais newspaper, although there is also a chance it could win none.
""Spain, one of very few European countries with no far-right lawmakers, is catching up,"" said Pablo Simon, a political science professor at Madrid's Carlos III university.
""This could have huge implications on the political system and on the political discourse here,"" he said, pointing to the conservative People's Party's new leader Pablo Casado's increasingly tough language on immigration. 
Andalusia, which has one the highest unemployment rates in Europe, is the entry point for thousands of Africans who have been reaching Spain by sea in greater numbers as traffic on the other main route across the Mediterranean to Italy has been curbed.
Opinion polls show the Socialists, who have ruled Andalusia since Spain's return to democracy, winning the most seats yet again, but falling short of a majority with the centre-right Ciudadanos and anti-austerity far-left also vying for seats.
The likely lack of a majority and uncertainty over forming a coalition foreshadows similar expected results in municipal, regional and EU elections in 2019, and a general election which must be held by the following year.
The Andalusia election will be the first electoral test for Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who came to power without an election in June after parliament ousted the conservatives over a corruption scandal.
""Andalusia is the first stop on the route to Socialist victories,"" Sanchez said in a rally backing regional candidate Susana Diaz, referring to the series of elections to come.
Speculation is rife in Spain over if, and when, the Socialists, who control fewer than a quarter of parliamentary seats and are still struggling to get the country's budget adopted in parliament, could call an election.
""A huge victory of the Socialists should be a positive message for Pedro Sanchez and might be considered as an incentive for early elections at a national level,"" Natixis analysts wrote in a note.
But senior Socialist party officials brushed off the idea, saying that they were hoping anti-austerity protests this week in Barcelona could convince Catalan nationalists to back the central government's budget and allow Sanchez to carry on as prime minister.

In a five-minute exchange on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Argentina, Macron conveyed ""very firm"" messages to the prince over the killing and the need to find a political solution for the situation in Yemen, an Elysee official also said.
The Saudi Gazette newspaper posted video of the meeting online showing the two speaking in hushed tones with their heads close together, Macron looking the crown prince in the eye and Prince Mohammed nodding his head and at times smiling.
In the audio, it is possible to make out the prince saying ""Don't worry"", to which Macron responds ""I am worried"". Later in the one-minute clip Macron says: ""You never listen to me"" and the crown prince replies: ""I will listen, of course."" 
At the end Macron can be heard saying: ""I am a man of my word.""
The Elysee said it was the first time that Macron and the crown prince, known as MbS, had spoken since Khashoggi's murder at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.
Khashoggi, an opinion writer for the Washington Post who was at one time a Saudi royal insider before becoming a critic of the leadership, was killed by lethal injection and dismembered by a group of Saudi men sent from the kingdom. 
Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor has said MbS knew nothing of the operation to kill Khashoggi.
Macron's office said the meeting with MbS justified because European nations wanted to send a united message about the need for probity in the investigation and were not going to sidestep an opportunity to reinforce that message during the G20. 
""We were not going to play hide and seek for 48 hours, it wouldn't make any sense,"" the official said. ""If we're here and he's at the table, let's be frank and not indulgent. Things that need saying will be said.""
Earlier, the Elysee said the video showed ""a sort of contrast between MbS's face sporting an embarrassed smile and the (French) president's face, which was rather stern, and was keen to convey these messages in a very firm manner"".

Overall the exchange appeared cordial, with Macron attempting to get his point across, speaking with his hands in front of him and looking MbS in the eye. MbS nods repeatedly and appears accommodating and somewhat apologetic.

MEXICO CITY/NEW YORK (Reuters) - During Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's successful campaign for the Mexican presidency, his advisers met representatives of dozens of investment funds to allay fears about the leftist's plans, saying he prized economic stability and wanted to attract foreign capital.
Initially, it worked.
When Lopez Obrador won office by a landslide on July 1, the peso and the stock market rose, buoyed by his conciliatory tone. The rally continued when Mexico and the United States reached a deal to rework the NAFTA trade pact in late August.
But the mood has since changed.
Lopez Obrador, who takes office on Saturday, began saying in September that Mexico was ""bankrupt."" When he canceled a new $13 billion Mexico City airport on Oct. 29 on the basis of a widely-derided referendum, investors took flight.
""(Lopez Obrador) behaved quite well from the election in early July until the referendum on the airport. That was really an indication of his true colors,"" said Penny Foley, portfolio manager for emerging markets and international equities groups at TCW Group Inc, which manages $198 billion in total.
Foley said the referendum prompted TCW to cut its exposure to bonds issued by state oil firm Pemex, on the grounds that under a Lopez Obrador administration the company would be driven more by politics than by profit.
""We are now slightly underweight Mexico in the dollar fund and neutral in the local currency fund,"" she added.
Lopez Obrador wants to attract investment from home and abroad to fuel economic growth and drive an ambitious infrastructure agenda, including a major rail project linking Cancun to Mexico's southeast, plus a new oil refinery.
Decisions such as the airport cancellation have fed investors' concerns he could push Mexico toward a more authoritarian, arbitrary and partisan form of government.
Mexico's S&P/BVM IPC stock index has tumbled 18 percent since the market's post-election peak on Aug. 28, while the peso has fallen around 8 percent against the dollar.
In an interview published on Friday, Lopez Obrador said the drop in the Mexican stock index was linked to external factors and that other bourses were falling too.
""I'd also like to note that we're not just going to govern for the markets,"" he told Mexican newspaper La Jornada.
Over the same three-month period, the MSCI Emerging Markets index has fallen about 7 percent.
Bond yields on Mexican 10-year sovereign debt have jumped 121 basis points, a sign investors see it as a riskier bet.
By contrast, yields on Brazil's 10-year debt have fallen over 20 basis points since the Oct. 28 presidential election victory of Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right politician who has appointed a group of pro-market economists to his team.
Mexican corporate debt markets have taken note.
Airport operator GAP, which controls terminals in a dozen cities including Tijuana and Guadalajara, canceled a planned 6 billion peso debt issuance this week.
""We decided to wait for better conditions"", GAP chief financial officer Saul Villarreal told Reuters.
Some European businesses are also in wait-and-see mode, said Alberico Peyron, a board member and former head of the Italian chamber of commerce in Mexico.
There was ""no panic so far"", but a few executives had put plans on hold until the picture became clearer, he said, adding: ""There are more who are worried than are optimistic.""

'ERRORS' MADE
After 30 years of kicking against the establishment, the veteran Lopez Obrador, a 65-year-old former mayor of Mexico City, claimed the presidency with a promise to clean up government, cut poverty and tame Mexico's drug cartels.
Aiming to almost double economic growth to around 4 percent, Lopez Obrador wants to revive Pemex, increase pensions and spur development in the poorer south to contain illegal immigration that has strained ties with U.S. President Donald Trump.
Lopez Obrador says rooting out corruption will free up billions of dollars, while he intends to save more with pay cuts for civil servants. However, critics say the cuts could affect the quality of officials in his new administration.
Johannes Hauser, managing director of the German chamber of commerce in Mexico, told Reuters the association's annual survey of firms, currently underway, was upbeat on Mexico.
Still, initial results suggested companies were not quite as eager to invest or create new jobs as they were a year ago. And the airport cancellation had been a shock, he said.
During their campaign outreach, some of Lopez Obrador's advisers sought to play down the airport's importance to markets, while others suggested it was likely to be completed. 
Without providing evidence, Lopez Obrador said the project - which has been under construction since 2015 - was tainted by corruption. But more than once, Lopez Obrador had raised the possibility of turning its completion into a private concession.
Incoming Finance Minister Carlos Urzua, whose team sat down with financial heavyweights such as Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), BlackRock,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), told Reuters in April that foreign investors were ""not very worried"" about the airport.
Now, the scrapping of the hub has raised the prospect of a messy legal dispute with investors that could cost billions of dollars - as well as cloud interest in new projects.
Some members of Lopez Obrador's incoming government privately express deep misgivings about the decision to cancel the airport, which was based on a referendum organized by his own party in which barely 1 percent of the electorate voted.
They felt the poll, which critics lambasted as opaque and open to abuse, undermined the credibility he had built up over the years he spent campaigning against corruption and vote-rigging.
Lopez Obrador's taste for rule by referendum, and changes to laws governing everything from banking to mining and pension funds that have been proposed by his National Regeneration Movement and the party's allies in Congress, have further curdled sentiment.
""I've moved from being cautiously optimistic after the election, to being quite pessimistic now,"" said Andres Rozental, a former deputy foreign minister of Mexico. ""He's not building on what he got. He's destroying little by little what he got."" 
Facing questions about the airport controversy from a panel of prominent Mexican journalists this month, Lopez Obrador was unrepentant about the referendum, saying that ""errors"" made were blown out of proportion by adversaries trying to hurt him.
""What I regard as most important in my life is my honesty,"" he said. ""We are not creating a dictatorship,"" he added, repeating what is a frequent aside in his public pronouncements.
Nevertheless, Arturo Herrera, an incoming deputy finance minister, conceded this week that the transition had tested the next government, which must present its first budget by mid-December.
""What we're all learning is that we need to be extremely careful,"" he told Mexican television.

South Sudan has suffered a wrenching five-year civil war and, despite a fragile peace accord signed two months ago by the government and rebel groups, remains riven with ethnic grievances and awash with weapons.
Civilians from rival groups bear the brunt of the violence and cycle of revenge. 
As well as rape, survivors of the violence in Bentiu also reported being whipped, beaten and clubbed with sticks and rifle butts, MSF said in a statement. They were also robbed of money, clothes, shoes and food ration cards.
""Some (of those raped) are girls under 10 years old and others are women older than 65. Even pregnant women have not been spared from these brutal attacks,"" said Ruth Okello, a midwife from MSF.
The state minister for information in Northern Liech State where the attacks were reported disputed the veracity of the reports.
""A rape of such a magnitude is not true,"" Lam Tungwar told Reuters. ""We are a state (that) respects human rights and women's rights top our list.""
Tungwar said local courts would tackle the cases of violence in Bentiu and other counties, but added: ""I don't concur with the current report because it doesn’t (accurately) portray us and the community in Northern Liech state."" 
South Sudan's President Salva Kiir signed a peace agreement with rebel factions in September to end the civil war that erupted in 2013 and has killed some 400,000 people and forced a third of the population from their homes. 
Previous peace deals have quickly fallen apart in the east African nation.

KIEV/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Ukraine on Friday banned Russian men of combat age from entering the country, a move introduced under martial law after Russia fired on and captured three Ukrainian naval ships off Crimea last weekend.
Ukraine announced it was barring entry to Russian men between 16-60 years and a senior state security official said Kiev was considering whether to respond in kind with ""mirror actions"" to the Black Sea incident.
Earlier, in a move applauded in Kiev, U.S. President Donald Trump called off a meeting with Russia's Vladimir Putin in Argentina to signal Washington's disapproval of Russian behavior in the naval clash with Ukraine.
The Russian rouble, which is sensitive to events that might lead to new sanctions being imposed on Russia, fell on news of the canceled meeting. Moscow said it expected the leaders to have an impromptu meet. 
In a further boost to Ukraine, the EU released 500 million euros in financial assistance to Kiev and European Council President Donald Tusk predicted Brussels would roll over sanctions on Russia at a summit on Dec. 13-14.
President Petro Poroshenko, referring to Russia's seizure and subsequent annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its support for separatist uprisings in eastern Ukraine, said banning Russian men was important for stopping a full-scale invasion. 
""These are measures to block the Russian Federation from forming detachments of private armies here, which in fact are representatives of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation,"" Poroshenko said.
""And not allow them to carry out the operations that they tried to conduct in 2014,"" he added.
In Moscow, a Russian lawmaker was quoted by RIA news agency as saying Russia had no plans for a reciprocal move to bar Ukrainian men.
EU SOLIDARITY
The EU has propped up Ukraine's war-scarred economy since the Crimea annexation while prodding the pro-Western authorities to pass reforms and tackle corruption. 
""Today's European Commission decision on disbursement comes at a crucial moment when Ukraine and its people face a new aggression from Russia and need to see solidarity from international partners,"" said Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis.
The G7 group of nations also weighed in on Ukraine's behalf, blaming Moscow's actions that had ""dangerously raised tensions."" 
Ukraine and Russia have blamed each other for last Sunday's clash at the Kerch Strait through which ships have to pass to reach Ukrainian ports at Berdyansk and Mariupol.
Russia has moved the 24 sailors it captured to prisons in Moscow, where three of them are being treated in a prison hospital, Russian TV said. Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin said Ukraine was trying to get consular access to them.
Sunday's clash prompted Ukraine to introduce martial law for a period of 30 days from Wednesday in regions of the country thought most vulnerable to a Russian attack. 
A senior ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the EU and United States should consider banning from their ports Russian ships originating from the Azov Sea as a tit-for-tat measure.
Russia says it will deploy a new division of Pantsir medium-range surface-to-air systems - comprising between 12 and 18 military vehicles - on the Crimean peninsula by the end of the year, Interfax news agency quoted a spokesman for the Southern (NYSE:SO) Military District as saying. 
The planned deployment comes after Russia announced it had deployed a new battalion of advanced S-400 surface-to-air missile systems, its fourth such battalion, to the peninsula's north. A Crimean security source was also quoted by Interfax on Thursday saying that Russia planned to build a new missile early-warning radar station in Crimea next year.
Russian officials accuse Poroshenko of artificially manufacturing a crisis to prop up sagging ratings ahead of an election next March. 
But the incident has prompted renewed calls for more Western sanctions on Russia. 
Tusk will chair an EU summit on Dec. 13-14, which is due to roll over for another year the bloc's measures against Russia's defense, energy and banking sectors.
""Europe is united in its support to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. This is why I am sure that the EU will roll over the sanctions against Russia in December,"" Tusk told a news conference in Argentina.
The United States and the EU have imposed sanctions on Russia since 2014, when Moscow annexed Crimea after a pro-Russian leader was toppled in Kiev.

Fighting between Ukraine and Moscow-backed separatists has killed more than 10,000 people. Major fighting ended with a 2015 ceasefire but deadly exchanges of fire are still frequent.

276,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2018 10:21AM ET</span>",EU ministers to finalize watered-down euro zone reform plans,"By Jan Strupczewski
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union finance ministers will seek final agreement on Monday on deeper euro zone integration which, after a year of negotiations, is likely to turn out much less ambitious than initially planned.
Championed by French President Emmanuel Macron, the reforms were meant to prepare the 19 euro countries for the next financial crisis and unite the EU around the single currency at a time of growing eurosceptic sentiment across the bloc.
But the talks ran into many difficulties: Germany did not have a proper government for almost six months, Italy elected a eurosceptic administration and the talks exposed fault lines between the north and the south and even between institutions.
Even though the integration plans concern only the euro zone, all of the EU's finance ministers except Britain's will discuss them on Monday because all might adopt the euro at some point in the future. 
""It will be long, it will be intense,"" one senior euro zone official involved in the preparations of the ministerial discussions said. ""It won't be as high level (in terms of ambition) as some people expected a year ago, but we may exceed a little bit the low expectations right now,"" he added.
The package agreed on Monday will then have to be endorsed by EU leaders on Dec 14.
STARTING POINT
The initial ideas included the creation of a large euro zone budget financed by dedicated taxes and national contributions, a euro zone finance minister in charge of it and a euro zone assembly in the European Parliament for democratic control.
The ESM euro zone bailout fund was to be transformed into a European Monetary Fund with wider powers of monitoring euro zone economies and a key role in a sovereign insolvency mechanism that would manage potential debt restructuring.
To break the doom-loop between governments and banks that buy large amounts of a single sovereign's debt and then collapse as the sovereign becomes insolvent, there were to be limits on the concentration one country's bonds in a bank's portfolio.
The banking system was to be strengthened with a European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS) that would guarantee deposits of up to 100,000 euros ($113,000) in any bank in any euro zone country. 
Finally a euro zone bank resolution fund, created in 2014, was to get emergency loans from the ESM if ran out of money during a major banking crisis.
LIKELY OUTCOME
Only some of these ideas survived and many of those that did are a shadow of what they were when proposed in 2017.
There will be no euro zone caucus in the European Parliament and no finance minister. The euro zone budget, which France initially saw in the hundreds of billions of euros, may not have a set size at all.
""It's gone from an elephant to a mouse. And the mouse is in a cage,"" Dutch finance minister Wopke Hoekstra said about the budget, according to the Financieele Dagblad newspaper.
The ESM will not be transformed into a European Monetary Fund, the very name of which raised objections from the European Central Bank. After months of haggling with the European Commission over the division of responsibilities, the ESM will get some monitoring duties for euro zone economies focused on debt sustainability, market access and borrowing costs.
It will likely be able to lend with fewer conditions to fundamentally sound euro zone economies so they can avoid the market stigma of a bailout and in this way help prevent crises.
It will also likely be the facilitator between investors and a government, should it ever come to debt restructuring, but there is no agreement yet on how much of the debt restructuring process should be pre-defined and how much left to discretion.
Any discussion on debt, or bond concentration in a bank, is made very difficult by Italy, which has the second highest debt-to-GDP ratio in Europe at more than 130 percent and relies heavily on domestic banks buying its bonds.
Rome is also causing alarm because its plans to borrow more to pay for promised handouts and tax cuts could potentially trigger another debt crisis like the one that nearly destroyed the euro some years ago.
This has added to northern European scepticism about pushing forward with EDIS, an idea which senior euro zone officials have described as now being ""on life support"" because of German worries they would have to guarantee deposits in Italian banks.

The reform that is likely to be announced with great fanfare will be providing the bank resolution fund with emergency ESM loans of up to around 55 billion euros. But even there, such a backstop would only be provided from 2024, with earlier support an option only if chances of it being called upon are small.

277,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>",Trump says Russian business efforts 'very legal & very cool',"By Susan Heavey
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday defended his decision to seek a business deal in Russia in 2016 even as he pursued the Republican presidential nomination, calling it ""very legal"" and ""very cool"" to keep running his business while campaigning.
In a series of tweets from Buenos Aires, where he is attending the G20 summit, Trump also said he had only ""lightly looked"" at a real estate project ""somewhere in Russia"" but that nothing had come of the effort.
A second guilty plea on Thursday by Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal lawyer, has raised new questions about Trump's dealings with Russia while he was also establishing Republican foreign policy during his run for the presidency. 
Trump repeatedly has said he had no ties to Russia. The U.S. Special Counsel's Office is investigating Moscow for alleged interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion with Trump's campaign.
Russia has denied U.S. intelligence conclusions that it meddled and Trump has frequently decried the investigation as a ""witch hunt."" Both have denied any collusion.
Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team has brought charges or secured convictions against more than two dozen Russian nationals and entities, as well as a number of Trump's associates, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who faced a hearing on Friday morning to schedule his sentencing. Mueller this week said Manafort had been lying to federal prosecutors despite his plea deal.
Cohen, who had already pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations and other financial crimes in a separate case brought by federal prosecutors in New York, on Thursday said he had lied to Congress about a proposed Trump Organization skyscraper project in Moscow. 
His plea agreement with Mueller's team showed the Trump Organization pursued the scheme further into the 2016 campaign than previously disclosed. Cohen also told Mueller's prosecutors he briefed Trump on the project more than three times. He also briefed members of Trump's family and had direct contact with Kremlin representatives. 
'LEGAL, COOL'
Trump lashed out at Cohen after the plea deal was announced, calling him ""a weak person"" and a liar. As he departed for Buenos Aires, Trump acknowledged his business dealings with Russia, telling reporters on Thursday: ""It doesn't matter because I was allowed to do whatever I wanted during the campaign.""
On Twitter on Friday he said that during his campaign he continued to run ""my business-very legal & very cool.""
Trump still owns his private company but had said he would hand over day-to-day dealings to his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump when he took office in January 2017.
His meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki earlier this year drew criticism after Trump appeared to cast doubt on U.S. intelligence findings of Russian meddling in the campaign and said Putin had been extremely strong in his denials.
After Cohen's plea, Trump canceled his planned meeting with Putin at the G20, citing the Ukraine crisis. Russia's Foreign Ministry on Friday said it believed the meeting was canceled over ""the U.S. domestic political situation."" A Kremlin spokesman reportedly said the two leaders will have an impromptu meeting.
Democrats and other critics said the latest revelations from Mueller's investigation have cast Trump's actions in a questionable light. 
""This whole thing has likely been a scam from the start,"" Democratic U.S. Senator Chris Murphy tweeted on Friday. ""It's not some wild coincidence that the Administration's foreign policy is most inexplicable toward the two countries - Russia and Saudi Arabia - where the Trump family pursues the most business.""

Concerns about Trump and the Mueller investigation have led to a bipartisan push in Congress to protect the special counsel, a move that has been blocked in the Republican-controlled Senate.

LONDON (Reuters) - The number of murders in London has fallen below that of New York City but could still hit a 10-year high if it continues at the current pace, police data analysed by Reuters shows. 
Provisional figures for February and March released earlier in the year suggested that the murder rate in London had overtaken New York for the first time in modern history.
But the number of murders in New York so far this year is now double the number in London, according to figures from the NYPD and London's Metropolitan (Met) Police.
There had been 112 murders in London to October this year, compared to 238 in New York. But with more murders in London in November, the total for the year stands at 127, on pace to reach the highest number since 2008, when there were 154.
""It's difficult for us to be even slightly positive when we've got the murder rate that we have,"" Patrick Green, CEO of the Ben Kinsella Trust, an anti-knife crime charity named after a young victim, told Reuters.
London and New York: murder totals in 2018: https://tmsnrt.rs/2PZnFn4
London and New York are similarly sized cities but there is less gun violence in Britain, which has strict gun control laws, than in the United States and most British police are not equipped with firearms. 
But the rise in violent crime in London is challenging that approach.
The Met denied that it would routinely deploy armed officers in communities affected by violence after media reports on Friday, but did say armed police might be deployed in specific instances where violence had happened, or where intelligence suggested it could happen imminently.
The rise is driven by an increase in knife crime. So far this year, 59 percent of homicides have been stabbings, while only 10 percent have been shootings.
Met Police Commander David Musker said a Violent Crime Task Force, formed earlier this year, had arrested more than 2,000 people in the last eight months and seized more than 460 knives, 340 offensive weapons and more than 100 lethal firearms.
""Whilst rates in London are now beginning to stabilise, we are not complacent and are committed to using all the powers at our disposal to tackle this issue,"" he said.
While lawmakers in Westminster obsess over Brexit, the rise in violent crime is still having political ramifications.
During an election campaign last year Prime Minister Theresa May was criticised for her record as interior minister, where she presided over police cuts. Rather than bolstering support for her Brexit plan through the vote, she lost her parliamentary majority.
May says that 460 million pounds has been made available for policing this year.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan has highlighted the difficulties caused by cuts in police numbers, but has himself faced scrutiny for saying that London remains one of the safest global cities in the world. 
In general terms, Khan is right: London ranked 20th in the Economist Intelligence Unit's Safe Cities Index 2017, above Paris, Milan and Moscow, and last year had a lower murder rate than Berlin.
But in an interview with BBC Radio this month, Khan said it could take ""a generation"" to deal with the increase in violent crime.

""To really make significant progress, it can take up to 10 years,"" Khan said.

Selahattin Demirtas, former co-chairman of the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) and one of Turkey's best known politicians, was detained two years ago on terrorism-related charges, which he denies. 
He was jailed in September for more than four years over comments in speech he gave in 2013. He has effectively served out that prison term, but faces more terrorism-related charges that could see him sentenced to up to 142 years if convicted.
The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has urged Turkey to swiftly process his legal case, saying his pre-trial detention had gone on longer than could be justified.
Hours after the ECHR's Nov. 20 ruling, Demirtas' lawyers applied for his immediate release, saying keeping the politician in jail would amount to a ""restriction on freedom"".
In its ruling on Friday, the Turkish court said the ECHR decision had not been finalised and unanimously rejected the appeal for Demirtas' release.
Benan Molu, one of Demirtas' lawyers, said the Turkish court ruling was unfounded. ""The ECHR's 'immediate release' ruling does not need to be finalised for it to be implemented. Every second he (Demirtas) is held in prison despite the ECHR ruling, there is a crime being committed,"" Molu said on Twitter. 
ECHR rulings are legally binding, but there have been many instances in which Turkey has not implemented them. President Tayyip Erdogan has dismissed the ruling on Demirtas, saying it amounted to support for terrorism.
At a tense news conference in Ankara last week, EU Foreign Affairs Chief Federica Mogherini called for the release of Demirtas. In response, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu called on the bloc to stop defending those aiming to ""remove Turkey's democratically elected government"". 

Ankara accuses the HDP of ties to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a decades-long insurgency in Turkey and is considered a terrorist organisation by the EU, United States and Turkey. The HDP denies direct links.

Oric, regarded as a hero by Bosnian Muslims, led the defense of Srebrenica, a besieged town that eventually fell to Bosnian Serb forces in 1995 who then killed more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys in Europe's worst atrocity since World War Two.
The second instance verdict was delivered after the court in June revoked its previous ruling, clearing Oric and fellow soldier Sabahudin Muhic of guilt, and ordered a new trial after the prosecutor complained of criminal procedures violations.
The appeals chamber found discrepancies in the statements of a key protected witness and ""could not find them credible and establish beyond a reasonable doubt the responsibility"" of Oric and Muhic for the alleged crimes, said judge Tihomir Lukes.
The verdict is final and cannot be appealed.
Branislav Dukic, the head of an association of Bosnian Serb prisoners of war, said the ruling was shameful. ""All Serbs should leave the state judiciary in response,"" he said.
The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) acquitted Oric of war crimes against Serbs in 2008, but he was arrested again in June 2015 in Switzerland on a warrant from Serbia accusing him of killing three Bosnian Serb prisoners of war early in the conflict.
During the war the United Nations declared Srebrenica a ""safe area"" but Dutch troops failed to prevent its capture by Bosnian Serb forces.

Almost seven months since the parliamentary election, Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri has hit a wall in his efforts to form a national unity government as political factions jostle for positions in a new cabinet.
Finance Minister Ali Hassan Khalil and World Bank Vice President for the Middle East and North Africa Ferid Belhaj said in a statement a new government was needed soon, ""to put an end to the confusion over the financial and economic situation and to produce a climate of confidence regarding the future of projects scheduled for Lebanon"".
Politicians have repeatedly warned there is a risk of economic crisis if a government is not formed soon.
The World Bank has committed $2.2 billion for projects in Lebanon including transport and job creation. But around $800 million is unused while awaiting government approval and Lebanon must pay commitment fees on it.
Members of the outgoing cabinet have remained in office in a caretaker capacity but are unable to take major decisions until a new cabinet is named.
More than $11 billion of international donor funding pledged in April is also contingent on a new government making a tangible commitment to economic reform.
Belhaj and another World Bank official two weeks ago said Lebanon was losing momentum and there was a risk donors might start losing interest. 
Lebanon has the world's third highest debt-to-GDP ratio and a new government must be in place before Lebanon embarks on major fiscal reforms. The International Monetary Fund said in June these reforms are urgently needed to put the debt on a sustainable footing.

The World Bank estimates Lebanon's national debt will stand at 155 percent of gross domestic product by the end of 2018 and that a rise in current spending will increase the fiscal deficit to 8.3 percent of GDP in 2018, from 6.6 percent in 2017.

The civil code will be updated to state that parental authority must be exercised without violence and that parents may not resort to ""physical, verbal or psychological violence, nor to corporal punishment or humiliation"".
The ban was approved in a thinly attended National Assembly session in the early hours of Friday, with 51 votes in favor, one against and three abstentions. 
It reverses parental rights to discipline children using corporal punishment granted under Napoleon in the early 1800s.
""Education through violence can only create more violence in society. It also leads to failure at school, illness, suicide, anti-social behavior and delinquence,"" said Maud Petit of the centrist MoDem party, a partner in parliament with French President Emmanuel Macron's LREM party.
The ban was proposed by France's gender equality minister, Marlene Schiappa, who told Le Parisien newspaper that parents are wrong to believe that shouting, slapping or twisting children's ears are appropriate ways to assert authority.
""No violence is educational,"" she said. 
French First Lady Brigitte Macron also supported the ban, but a few conservative and far-right MPs have condemned it as an interference in families' private lives.
As part of the vote, the government will prepare a report about parental violence and propose measures to educate parents. 

Following the example of Sweden in 1966, some 54 countries - including 22 of the EU's 28 member countries - have introduced similar laws banning corporal punishment in the home, according to French data.

The regulation is the latest example of a rise in government and public hostility toward the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community in the world's largest Muslim-majority country. 
Homosexuality is not regulated by law in Indonesia, except in the conservative province of Aceh, but the country has seen a growing number of bylaws targeting LGBT people.
The council in the city of Pariaman in West Sumatra passed a regulation on Tuesday banning ""acts that are considered LGBT"", deputy mayor Mardison Mahyudin said by telephone. 
The regulation, revising an existing public order bylaw, would be evaluated by the governor within 15 days, he said, adding that it was part of the city's effort to ""eradicate LGBT"".
""According to our customs, the Minang customs, we are against such acts and behavior,"" he said. The Minang are one of the main ethnic groups living that part of Sumatra island.
The regulation contains clauses to penalize LGBT people ""who conduct activity that disturbs public order"" or commit ""immoral acts with the same-sex"", according to a media report citing the bylaw.
Andreas Harsono, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, said the regulation was unconstitutional for being discriminatory.
""It's a local ordinance that has no grounds on Indonesia's constitution nor other national laws,"" he told Reuters. 
""It's just another sign that Indonesia is increasingly having two legal systems: the constitutional one and the so-called Islamic sharia system.""

PIETERMARITZBURG, South Africa (Reuters) - South Africa's former president Jacob Zuma wants corruption charges relating to a $2.2 billion arms deal to be permanently set aside, his lawyers said on Friday, when Zuma made his fourth court appearance since the charges were reinstated.
Zuma, who was ousted by the ruling party in February, faces 16 charges of fraud, racketeering and money laundering relating to a deal to buy 30 billion rand of European military hardware for South Africa's armed forces in the late 1990s.
The case is a rare example of an African leader being held to account for his actions. Zuma denies wrongdoing.
On Friday, judge Mjabuliseni Madondo adjourned the case to May 20, giving lawyers time to prepare for a debate on whether there should be a ""permanent stay of prosecution"".
Zuma's lawyer Mike Hellens said on Friday that state prosecutors had displayed a dismissive attitude towards Zuma. 
The 76-year-old Zuma, wearing a black suit and red tie, was subdued in court. Several former cabinet ministers and African National Congress politicians travelled to Pietermaritzburg, the capital of KwaZulu-Natal province, to support their former patron.
Addressing his supporters after the court appearance, Zuma said he believed the case violated his rights as a South African citizen and that there were ""many unlawful things"" that investigators did.
Zuma said more details would be presented in court.
""We filed papers telling the court that this case shouldn't continue, it should be set aside once and for all,"" Zuma told the cheering crowd.
Zuma, whose nine years in power were marked by economic stagnation and credit rating downgrades, has previously said he is the victim of a politically motivated witch-hunt.
The charges against him were originally filed a decade ago but then set aside by the National Prosecuting Authority shortly before he successfully ran for president in 2009.
After his election, his opponents fought a lengthy legal battle to have the charges reinstated, finally succeeding in 2016. Zuma countered with his own legal challenges.
The speed with which prosecutors have moved against Zuma is a sign of his waning influence since he was replaced as head of state by Cyril Ramaphosa, his former deputy.
Ramaphosa has made the fight against corruption a priority as he seeks to woo foreign investment and revamp an ailing economy.

Earlier German daily Rheinische Post cited security sources as saying the government was checking whether the incident on Thursday had a ""criminal background"", though the sources added that investigators would typically look ""in all directions"" after such an incident.
But a spokesman for the German Air Force said there was no suspicion of any crime, adding: ""It's a standard check of the radio equipment that failed."" 
Merkel was on her way from Germany to the summit when the government's Airbus A340 made an unscheduled but safe landing at Cologne-Bonn airport late on Thursday.
Guido Henrich, commander of the German Air Force's government fleet, told reporters the pilots experienced the radio failure over the Netherlands and that other systems failed too, so they landed at Cologne-Bonn airport.
An electronic failure was the problem.
""The part concerned was an electronic distribution box, which we have changed,"" Henrich, adding that the Air Force was sending another plane to Argentina on Friday for Merkel's return journey from the G20.
Der Spiegel magazine said the government plane's entire communication system malfunctioned, constituting a serious emergency, with the crew forced to plan the landing using an on-board satellite phone.
The air force spokesman said the plane had not discharged jet fuel before landing in Cologne, contrary to earlier reports.

Merkel called the incident a ""serious malfunction"". She and German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz were due to resume their travel to Buenos Aires early on Friday, but they will arrive after G20 leaders start their discussions.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Scores of Belgian protesters wearing the yellow vests that have become a symbol of anti-tax demonstrators in neighboring France blocked a key road junction in central Brussels on Friday, calling on the government to resign.
Police closed several key access tunnels to the city center, causing jams but avoiding a build-up of stalled traffic around the protest, where a Reuters journalist estimated the number of demonstrators at about 200 in late morning. Police said they had received no official request to hold such demonstration.
There was no sign of riot police or water cannon in the immediate vicinity. Plainclothes officers monitored the protest as people sporting the fluorescent yellow safety vests that Belgian drivers must carry in their vehicles chanted complaints about fuel costs and a ruling coalition which they say is placing an undue burden on struggling low-paid households.
Protests in Belgium, notably around fuel depots in the French-speaking south, have been inspired by the yellow vest -- or ""gilet jaune"" -- actions in France against increases in fuel duty imposed by President Emmanuel Macron's government as part of efforts to reduce emissions causing global warming.
""Michel, resign!"" people chanted on Friday at the Arts-Loi intersection, close to the office of liberal Prime Minister Charles Michel. He voiced sympathy for people's difficulties on Thursday, but added: ""Money doesn't fall from the sky.""

His center-right coalition faces an election in May.

The coalition could not immediately be reached for comment on the report. Syrian state media also reported dozens of deaths this week. 
The Observatory said strikes beginning overnight on Wednesday in and around al-Shafa in the Deir al-Zor countryside had targeted a hospital, prison and houses used by jihadists in their pocket on the eastern bank of the Euphrates river near the Iraqi border.
The Observatory said around 40 prisoners, civilians and fighters had been killed in strikes with more wounded. The toll rose as bodies were pulled from the rubble. 
Syrian state news agency SANA, citing local sources, said new air strikes on Friday on al-Shafa killed around 30, bringing the total killed this week in strikes on the Islamic State pocket to around 45. 
The Syrian government has written to the United Nations a number of times protesting casualties caused by air strikes by the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State. 
The U.S.-led coalition, now in a push to defeat the final remnants of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, has previously said it investigates reports of civilian casualties and does all it can to avoid them.

Tension between the two powers in disputed Asian waters comes as their relationship has between strained by a row over trade involving increasingly severe rounds of tariffs on billions of dollars worth of each other's imports.
The U.S. guided-missile cruiser USS Chancellorsville sailed near the Paracel Islands on Monday to challenge China's ""excessive maritime claims"", the U.S. Pacific fleet said in a statement.
China foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, told a daily news briefing the U.S. ship had entered Chinese waters without permission and China had made its position known with its ""stern representations"".
The Chinese army said it had sent ships and planes to watch the U.S. ship and to warn it to leave.
The Chancellorsville's voyage was the latest in what the United States calls freedom of navigation operations aimed at challenging what it sees as Chinese activity limiting freedom of movement in the strategic waters.
In particular, the United States has criticized China's construction of islands on tiny reefs and shoals and its installation of military facilities on them, including air strips and docks.
China claims ""irrefutable"" sovereignty over most of the South China Sea and the islands in it, and accuses the United States of raising military tension with its navy presence there.
Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam all claim parts of the waterway, through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes each year. Taiwan also claims the waters.

Phan Van Vinh, former head of the Police General Department, and Nguyen Thanh Hoa, former head of the high-tech crime police department, were jailed for nine and 10 years, respectively.
Both were convicted of ""abusing power in performance of official duties"", the online newspapers VnExpress and Zing News said. 
Officials and state media in the communist-ruled country often denounce gambling as a ""social evil"" but it is widespread. Police shut down dozens of gambling rings annually.
""I will have to say sorry for the rest of my life because the consequence of the case is so serious,"" Vinh told the court last week, according to the ministry statement.
State media reports said that Vinh was taken to hospital on Friday suffering from high blood pressure and wasn't at the court to hear the sentencing.

Flight MH370 was on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014, with 239 people on board, when it vanished, and became one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries.
The next of kin of some of those on board handed the government the five pieces of debris they said had been found by villagers in Madagascar, in three difference locations, one bit found as recently as August.
""The fact that debris is still washing up now means that the investigation should still be live. It shouldn’t be closed,"" said Grace Nathan, a lawyer whose mother, Anne Daisy, was on the plane.
Malaysian and international investigators believe the jet veered thousands of miles off course before plunging into the Indian Ocean.
In July, investigators released a 495-page report, saying the plane's controls were likely deliberately manipulated to take it off course but they were not able to determine who was responsible.
More than 30 bits of suspected debris have collected from various places around the world but only three wing fragments, which washed up along the Indian Ocean coast, have been confirmed to be from MH370.
Transport Minister Anthony Loke, who met the next of kin, said the government would consider resuming a search if provided with credible leads.
""We are open to proposals, but we must have some credible leads before we decide,"" Loke said.
In May, Malaysia called off a three-month search by U.S. firm Ocean Infinity, which spanned 112,000 sq km (43,243 sq miles) in the southern Indian Ocean and ended with no significant findings.

It was the second major search after Australia, China and Malaysia ended a fruitless A$200 million ($144.80 million) search across an area of 120,000 sq km (46,332 sq miles) last year.

The U.S. military says it is investigating the incident on Tuesday in which a helicopter hit a compound during a joint operation with U.S. and Afghan forces in Garmsir district in Helmand.
Local residents said at least 30 people were killed in the strike ,which came amid a surge in air operations as the U.S. military takes a more aggressive approach to force the Taliban toward peace negotiations.
The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan noted a sharp increase in civilian casualties from air strikes and said it was particularly concerned that children have been hit.
""Initial findings indicate that the vast majority of the victims were women and children,"" it said in a statement on the latest incident in Helmand. 
""The Mission is actively working to verify information indicating up to 10 children were killed along with eight women, and three children were injured, including an eight-year-old boy.""
According to UN figures, there were 649 civilian casualties from air strikes in the first nine months of the year, more than in any entire year since at least 2009, when UNAMA began systematic documentation of casualty figures.

The 213-page report, published by the U.S. think tank Hoover Institution on Thursday, said China's ruling Communist Party had in recent years ""significantly accelerated"" both the investment and intensity of its global influence-seeking efforts.
The report was penned by a group of more than 30 prominent Western experts, such as Orville Schell, director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society in New York, many whom had long advocated for closer engagement with China. 
The sharper tone comes as President Xi Jinping has increased repression at home and adopted what the report describes as an ""increasingly forward and aggressive posture on the global stage"".
China's state-run Global Times said the report's threat assessment was unfounded. 
""We believe the Chinese infiltration into the United States the report describes does not match up with China's objective aspirations,"" the newspaper said in an editorial.
The report, however, found that there was now a ""surprising"" level of bi-partisan scepticism about China's intentions and a willingness to push back against its ""predatory"" policies.
""China is exploiting America's openness in order to advance its aims on a competitive playing field,"" it said. ""Once largely a form of economic competition, China's recent turn to military and political rivalry with the United States has changed the whole equation of the bilateral relationship.""
In order to counter China's activities, the report makes a series of suggestions for United States lawmakers, institutions and businesses that it said could help ensure ""transparency, integrity and reciprocity"".
It recommends denying U.S. visas to Chinese journalists and having scholars affiliated with the Chinese government-run ""Thousand Talents Programme"" registered as a foreign agent. 
The report also lauded recent legislation that strengthened the review process by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), an interagency panel that assesses the national security implications of investment.
Legislation passed in June by U.S. President Donald Trump was a ""substantial improvement"" that closed loopholes that China had been exploiting, it said.
The authors also included a note of caution that China's efforts should not be exaggerated.
""China has not sought to interfere in a national election in the United States or to sow confusion or inflame polarization in our democratic discourse the way Russia has done,"" it said.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said it was their custom not to give detailed comment on think tank reports, but he said China welcomed U.S. companies, media, students and think tanks to come to the country.

""We hope that the United States, as the world's most powerful country, can open both arms and welcome companies, the media, think tanks and students from all countries, including China, to go to the United States,"" he told reporters.

PVC producer Hebei Shenghua had leaked vinyl chloride during production, and it caught fire and caused a chain explosion that burned trucks and buildings, parent company ChemChina said.
In the statement posted on its website, ChemChina apologized for the accident and said it reflected serious problems in its safety management systems.
Zhangjiakou, about 156 km (96 miles) northwest of Beijing, is set to host the 2022 Winter Olympics along with the capital.
The National Administration for Work Safety Emergency Response said it will launch an inspection of all large-scale chemical plant plants in the wake of the last explosion, the official Xinhua news Agency reported. 
Public anger over safety standards has grown in China in recent years after three decades of swift economic growth have been marred by accidents ranging from mining disasters to factory fires.
In August 2015, 165 people were killed in a chemical warehouse explosion in the port city of Tianjin. The government found that the disaster was causes by improperly or illegally stored hazardous materials.
China has vowed to improve industrial standards, but environmentalists say they fear oversight weaknesses persist, including an opaque production process for hazardous chemicals.

Poland asked to buy the HIMARS system, produced by  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT), last year. 
""This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security of the United States by improving the security of a NATO ally which is an important force for political stability and economic progress in Europe,"" the DSCA said in a statement released late on Thursday.
The DSCA leads U.S. efforts to train and equip allies.
Poland's Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak signed off on a new program to update the country's military on Wednesday, including strengthened cybersecurity and new air defense and long-range missile systems.
The purchase of the HIMARS launchers and related equipment, estimated to cost around $655 million, is part of this upgrade. ""This is a big step toward finalizing this breakthrough contract for the Polish army,"" Blaszczak tweeted on Friday. 
Poland's armed forces have suffered from decades of under-investment and some two-thirds of their equipment dates from the Soviet era.
The country has long vowed to increase defense spending, in part to deter what it sees as Russian aggression in the region, and wants to increase the presence of American troops on its territory.
In a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in September, Poland's President Andrzej Duda said Poland was ready to invest $2 billion to facilitate the development of a permanent base.
Duda also said he wants government plans to increase defense spending to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2030 to be speeded up to 2024 if the economy permits.

NATO has requested member countries spend at least 2 percent of their GDP on defense.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese police have arrested two trade union officials after they helped workers try to set up a union, a source told Reuters on Friday, the latest detentions in a nationwide crackdown on labor activists.
China's latest round of labor activism began this year when a company called Jasic International, a welding machinery manufacturer in the southern city of Huizhou, fired some workers for attempting to set up a union.
The sacked workers staged weeks of protests, drawing in support from activists.
The protests sparked detentions by the authorities, first of the protest organizers, then of student activists and most recently of supporters on top university campuses.
The stability-obsessed Chinese Communist Party is suspicious of all forms of grassroots organization that operate beyond its control, especially any that might lead to large-scale protests.
On Nov. 9, police detained two community officials from the All China Federation of Trade Unions in the southern city of Shenzhen, said a source with knowledge of the situation.
Police told their families that they were suspected of ""picking quarrels and provoking trouble"", a crime in China, said the source, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The Shenzhen Public Security Bureau did not respond to a faxed request for comment. 
The All China Federation of Trade Unions also did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment. 
All unions in China have to register with the official federation. The Communist Party has been calling for it federation to do a better in helping to improve workers' livelihood. 
But those improvements do not include allowing workers to organize freely.
Labor rights groups say that the federation remains more responsive to the demands of management than workers.
One of the detained officials is a woman, Zou Liping, who helped Jasic workers apply to set up a union led by members they had elected, and she also advised them about the law, according to a former worker.
""If she wasn't there, then maybe we wouldn't have been able to do it .... She told us how to legally set up a labor union,"" said the worker, who also declined to be identified.
""Even those within the system, if they have empathy for the workers, then they can be detained too,"" the worker said.
The first source identified the second detained union official as Li Ao.
The plight of factory workers at companies like Jasic has become a focus for students and recent graduate activists who have eschewed normal career paths in favor of working to address inequality and other social issues.
More than 30 people are in detention as part of the crackdown on the protests, according to a support group.
Reuters was unable to independently verify the group's tally of the detained.

DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - The race to succeed Angela Merkel as leader of Germany's ruling conservatives, and take pole position to succeed her as chancellor, is going down to the wire.
Two frontrunners have emerged with opposing visions for the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) since Merkel said last month she would step down as party chief following a regional election setback. 
One is Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, a Merkel protege seen as the candidate of continuity. The other is Friedrich Merz, a long-time Merkel rival who promises more radical change.
The outcome of the vote for a new leader at a party congress on Dec. 7-8 is crucial not only for the CDU, which governs in a three-party coalition, but also for the future of the European Union's dominant country and biggest economy. Merkel remains chancellor but whoever takes over the CDU is likely to be its candidate in the next federal election, due by October 2021.
Kramp-Karrenbauer, who was leader of the state of Saarland for nearly seven years, leads in polls of party supporters. But Merz, who is returning to politics after a decade in business, is a close second and is backed by CDU members who want an end to Merkel's consensual politics and love of compromise.
In the sixth of eight debates before the CDU congress in Hamburg, it was Merz who captured the 4,000-strong audience this week in the western city of Duesseldorf, capital of his home state, North Rhine-Westphalia. 
Lamenting a slide in opinion polls for the CDU, he wooed the crowd by pledging: ""We must resist this trend, we must stop it and we must reverse it."" 
In a dig at Merkel's style of politics, he said: ""We haven't taken clear positions.""
Kramp-Karrenbauer, 56, was at a disadvantage on Merz's home turf and received only polite applause. But she has been scoring points by presenting herself as more in touch with the public than her rich opponent, derided by media for describing himself as ""upper middle class"" rather than upper class. 
""I'm not sure that becoming a millionaire is really the purpose of life,"" she said last week.
She also said she used to play rock group AC/DC's raucous song Highway to Hell ""nice and loud"" while on her way to parliamentary debates and alone in her car.
NEW CHAPTER
Merkel, 64, said when she stepped down as party leader that she wanted ""to open a new chapter"" and that her current, fourth term as chancellor would be her last.
Merkel has come to dominate European politics since she first became chancellor in 2005, but her authority was dented by recent regional election setbacks and a close ally losing his role as leader of her conservatives' parliamentary group.
She has also lost popularity over her decision in 2015 to open Germany’s doors to migrants fleeing war in the Middle East and Africa in 2015.
Merz and Kramp-Karrenbauer lead a field that also includes Health Minister Jens Spahn, though he trails a distant third in polls. Their fate will be decided by 1,001 CDU delegates. 
Merz led the center-right's parliamentary group from 2000 to 2002 but lost out to Merkel in a power struggle in 2002 and has not held a seat in the Bundestag since 2009.
Merz says he respects Merkel and would work well with her if he won the vote. A self-declared ""free-trade man"" who heads the German arm of the U.S. investment fund BlackRock, Merz said earlier this month Germany should ""contribute more"" to the EU as it benefits from a euro that is ""too weak for our economy"".
Last week, he raised an outcry by questioning Germany's constitutional guarantee of asylum to all ""politically persecuted"", which was enshrined in the 'Basic Law' to atone for World War Two Nazi crimes.
He also criticized the CDU for watching with just a ""shrug of the shoulders"" as the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) entered state assemblies and the Bundestag.
The euro comments strayed from the mainstream political consensus in Berlin, but the comments on asylum and the AfD played into Kramp-Karrenbauer's hands.
IRON FIST, VELVET GLOVE
Describing his comments on the AfD as ""a slap in the face"" to all those in the CDU who worked hard to combat the far-right party, she said: ""It is naive to pretend you can just say or decide something and then the fight against the AfD is won.""
Her approach to politics, she added at the weekend, was: ""A policy of an iron fist in a velvet glove."" 
Sometimes referred to as AKK or ""mini Merkel"", she has a track record of winning state elections and forming coalitions in Germany's fractured political arena. But on what lies ahead for the CDU, she says: ""I have no particular recipe."" 
Kramp-Karrenbauer's trump card is her record as former state premier in Saarland, where she led a broad coalition with the Greens and pro-business Free Democrats - a potential plus as three-way alliances could become more common in Germany if no single party can dominate.
Most of the CDU delegates who will vote on the new leader are career politicians - lawmakers, mayors or councillors - who are usually pragmatic. This could work in her favor as someone who has risen through the CDU's ranks to the role of general-secretary of he federal party, based in Berlin. 
But Merz will also benefit from the fact that 296 of the delegates at the congress -- almost 30 percent -- will be from his home state.
""I'm for Merz because he address problems clearly,"" one CDU member, 58-year-old Bernd Hohaus, said after listening to the leadership candidates in Duesseldorf on Wednesday evening. ""We don't have to please everyone.""
Ute Gremmel-Geuchen, an organist from nearby Kempen, also sees Merz as ""very convincing.""
""Mrs Kramp-Karrenbauer has experience -- but in the Merkel government. In my view, it's time for something new. We need a change,"" she said.
Jan Techau, a political analyst at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a think tank, sees a close race.

""If I had to bet, I would put my money on her (Kramp-Karrenbauer),"" said Techau. ""But I wouldn't bet the house on it.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Indian farmers and rural workers marched to the Indian parliament in the capital, New Delhi, on Friday in a protest against soaring operating costs and plunging produce prices that have brought misery to many.
The protest is one of the biggest displays of frustration with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, which faces a tough general election due by May next year. India's 263 million farmers make up an important voting bloc.
""Farmers have been routinely committing suicide,"" said one of the protest leaders, Yogendra Yadav, as he marched in a crowd down a central Delhi thoroughfare.
""It's a shame that the government doesn't have any time for those who feed us,"" said Yadav, who leads the Jai Kisan Andolan, a farmers' group.
Low food prices, export curbs, anti-inflation policies that keep rural incomes low and a broad shift from subsidies to investment spending have all infuriated and demoralized farmers.
Agriculture contributes about 15 percent to India's $2.6 trillion economy, Asia's third-largest, but employs nearly half of its 1.3 billion people.
Farmers from more than 200 groups began gathering in New Delhi on Thursday. They are demanding that the government call a special session of parliament to discuss the crisis in the countryside.
""I myself know so many farmers who have committed suicide, and their families are now living in penury,"" said farmer Lakhan Pal Singh from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state.
""The policies of the Modi administration are responsible for the plight of farmers."" 
The discontent in the countryside, where 70 percent of Indians live, could erode support for Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which won India's biggest parliamentary mandate in three decades in the last general election in 2014.
But political analysts and farm economists say Modi will find it hard to repeat that next time.
""We voted for the BJP but anti-farmer policies of the government have hit us hard,"" said Singh.
Last year, police shot and killed six farmers protesting against lower prices in the central state of Madhya Pradesh, which recently held a state assembly election - a neck-and-neck contest between the BJP and opposition Congress party.

The result is due on Dec. 11.

Thai authorities arrested Hakeem AlAraibi, who plays in Australia where he has refugee status, on arrival at a Bangkok airport this week based on an Interpol notice issued at Bahrain's request.
AlAraibi was convicted of vandalizing a police station in Bahrain and sentenced to 10 years in prison in absentia. He has denied wrongdoing.
""We have to deport him to the country of origin or extradite him. According to the law, we have rights to detain him as long as we want, but within the necessary scope,"" said an immigration official who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media.

NEW DELHI/CAIRO (Reuters) - Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and told him about plans to scale up investments in India's tech, farm and energy sectors, an Indian official and the Saudi news agency (SPA) said on Friday.
The two leaders, who are in Argentina for the G20 summit, met in the prince's residence in Buenos Aires and discussed Saudi Arabia's readiness to supply India with oil and petroleum products.
The G20 summit in Buenos Aires is the first major international event the Saudi prince has attended since the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October.
The Saudi prince told Modi he would soon be finalizing an initial investment in India's National Investment and Infrastructure Fund, a quasi-sovereign wealth fund, to help accelerate the building of ports, highways and other projects, a top Indian diplomat said.
""The crown prince also referred to future projects for investments, in sectors such as tech, energy and farm,"" Indian Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale, who is accompanying Modi to the G20, said in a readout of the meeting.
Ways in which Saudi Arabia could replace its agricultural imports from other countries with Indian agricultural produce were also discussed, the Saudi news agency said. 
Since he took office in 2014 at the head of a Hindu-nationalist government, Modi has sought to expand ties with Saudi Arabia and other Islamic nations to deny arch foe Pakistan an advantage and to leverage India's fast-growing economy as an attractive investment.
STABLE OIL
The meeting with the Saudi crown prince was Modi's first in a set of ""bilaterals"" on the sidelines of the G20 that will be followed by meetings with U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.
""We expect that in the next two to three years there will be significant scaling up of Saudi investments in India,"" Gokhale said. The two leaders also talked about cooperation in arms manufacturing and Saudi Arabia's efforts to develop a domestic arms industry, SPA said.
Modi stressed the importance of stable energy prices and the two leaders discussed ways in which Saudi Arabia, a top crude oil supplier, could help stabilize prices, particularly for India, Gokhale said.
India, the world’s third-biggest oil importer, has been grappling with a combination of soaring prices and a falling currency, which makes imports of dollar-denominated oil more expensive, until a recent fall in oil prices.
Saudi Arabia has told India it is committed to meeting its rising oil demand and is the ""shock absorber"" for supply disruptions in the oil market.
The crown prince also discussed with Modi Saudi oil giant Aramco's investment in refineries in India, including the company's project to build a large refinery on the western coast of India, SPA said.

The two leaders also explored investing in solar energy through Softbank's Saudi-backed Vision Fund and opportunities to export Saudi non-oil products to India.

Children, parents and teachers gathered in Sydney's central business district in the lunch hour, chanting ""ScoMo's got to go"", referring to Prime Minister Scott Morrison.
There were similar protests in Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and elsewhere after students in the national capital of Canberra held a protest earlier in the week.
""This is just the beginning. This is our first strike, our first movement altogether... We will keep leading more campaigns until something is done,"" one of the protest leaders told the screaming, uniform-wearing crowd.
Australia is one of the largest carbon emitters per capita, in part because of its reliance on coal-fired power plants. Earlier this year, the conservative government also weakened its commitment to the U.N. Paris climate accord. 
Energy policy has created deep fissures in the conservative coalition and climate change skeptics were a key force in deposing Malcolm Turnbull as prime minister in August. 
Morrison has criticized the protests, saying he wanted more learning and less activism in schools, and Resources Minister Matt Canavan said the action was setting the children up for failure.
""Walking off school and protesting, you don't learn anything from that,"" Canavan said in a radio interview. ""The best thing you learn about going to a protest is how to join the dole queue because that's what your future life will look like.""
But teachers and parents at the protest said they believed the protests was significant for children's learning. 
""This is as good an education as being in a classroom... I think this is a good way for kids to learn to be involved, to be active and to take some action for something that affects them directly,"" said Maria, a 39-year-old Sydney mother who accompanied her nine year-old son to the protest.

The three-minute advert beckoning travelers with a Christmas greeting from ""the nicest place on earth"" sees Santa accidentally emailing his 2018 list of naughty children to a student in New Zealand named Elvis Anderson instead of his elves at the North Pole. 
Sitting in detention, Anderson gets the idea of gathering the naughty kids from around the world to fix the problem, and calls on New Zealand's national carrier to help transport the children to the summit on the country's North Island. 
Each child representing a country makes promises to change their behavior for the better by eating more vegetables, reducing flatulence and cutting down on hair-pulling.
The American boy, dressed in a two-piece suit and red sloganed cap, says he is not naughty at all and is the nicest person he knows, provoking laughter from the other children, reminiscent of the reaction to Trump's speech to the U.N. General Assembly in September, when he spoke about the achievements of his administration. 
""I didn't expect that reaction, but that's okay"", the boy adds in the advertisement, the same words Trump used at the United Nations.
Further pledges to be good from Anderson, including one to be nicer to neighboring Australia made with his fingers crossed behind his back to suggest he doesn't intend to keep the promise, pushes a meter to ""Nice"" for the children, and confetti rains down as they celebrate.

The pro-independence Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP) suffered a serious set-back at the Saturday polls, loosing key cities in mayoral elections to the China-friendly Kuomintang, including the former DPP stronghold of Kaohsiung in the south.
China has heaped pressure on Tsai since she took office in 2016, believing she wishes to push for the island's formal independence, a red line for Beijing which claims self-ruled Taiwan as its own.
Meeting a delegation from the U.S.-based National Committee on American Foreign Policy, Tsai reiterated that her China policy would not change, and that people were voting on local issues rather than on ties across the Taiwan Strait.
""We basically do not believe that in this local election people made a choice on the cross-strait policy issue or made a major change,"" Tsai said, in comments carried live on her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
""So our policy on maintaining the status quo will remain unchanged,"" she added.
""While the DPP's performance left us disappointed, democratic elections are our most cherished asset and our greatest difference with China.""
Beijing has barely contained its glee at the election result, saying it showed Taiwan's people's desire for better ties with China.
Tsai said there were challenges in the election, including fake news exacerbated by ""outside forces"" - a reference to China - something she said any democracy faces.

Tsai faces re-election in a little over a year's time at Taiwan's next presidential vote.

TIJUANA, Mexico (Reuters) - A handful of the thousands of Central American migrants camped out at the U.S.-Mexican border waiting to plead their case for asylum in the United States launched a hunger strike on Thursday to protest the Mexican police blocking their way.
Members of the 6,000-strong caravan, mostly migrants from Honduras, have been sleeping outdoors, on cold floors or on mats in an overcrowded shelter since they arrived in Tijuana city across the border from San Diego, California, three weeks ago. 
Mexican immigration authorities on Thursday began transporting some of the migrants via buses to a new shelter to help lessen the strain. 
Under the harsh immigration policies introduced by the administration of President Donald Trump, U.S. border officials say they may have to stay put in Mexico for months before they can petition the authorities.
U.S. customs and border control officers fired tear gas canisters into Mexico at dozens of migrants who tried to rush border fencing on Sunday.
On Thursday, as a steady rain fell and partially flooded the sports complex serving as the main shelter, it was Mexican police who stopped more than a dozen migrants from the caravan approaching the nearby El Chaparral border crossing. 
""What the police are doing is unfair. The truth is we are fighting for our rights,"" said one of the migrants, Gerson Madrid, a 22-year-old Honduran who started the trek to the United States in early October to better provide for a young daughter he left behind.
Madrid said the group was starting a three-day hunger strike to draw attention to the standoff.
""Why are (the police) treating us like this if we're not causing them or the Mexican people any trouble?"" he said.
Officials with Mexico's human rights commission said the new facility opened on Thursday is bigger than the sports complex, which can handle only about 2,000 people, and will ensure migrants are not forced to sleep out in the open.
Overcrowding along with cooler temperatures and rain has already helped spread illness among migrants, including flu-like sicknesses, lice and chicken pox, according to city officials who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media.
Despite the conditions, many caravan migrants appeared determined to wait as long as it takes, with more than 600 applying for work permits in Mexico earlier this week, according to Mexican officials.
Trump has threatened to ""permanently"" close the U.S.-Mexican border if Mexico does not deport those gathered in Tijuana.

Mexico's government has pushed back, arguing that the migrants have a right to ask U.S. officials for asylum. U.N. agencies said this week asylum seekers fleeing violence or persecution are entitled to lodge claims to obtain sanctuary.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Dozens of South Korean conscientious objectors were released from jail on parole on Friday after a landmark court decision that conscience is a valid reason to refuse mandatory military service.
The Supreme Court, South Korea's top court, overturned earlier in November about five decades of precedents that punished conscientious objectors, a change that is in step with shifting attitudes as relations with North Korea thaw. 
An official from the Ministry of Justice said on Friday the ministry decided to release on parole 58 conscientious objectors who had been in jail for six months or more. 
That would reduce the number of conscientious objectors in jail from 71 to 13, South Korean online media Money Today reported, citing an unidentified law enforcement source. 
The parolees will be doing community service, the justice ministry official said. 
Among those released, eight clean-shaven young men, some dressed in suits, stood in front of Daegu Detention Centre to pose for media photographs. The parolees were released from several detention centers around the country. 
""I fully understand critical views on conscientious objection, given that in South Korea we have a duty of national defense,"" one of the men, a 26-year-old surnamed Kim, told Yonhap news agency. 
""Whether it's alternative service or community service, we hope to diligently do the work given to us and change views from negative to positive,"" he said.
The 58 released on Friday had been serving jail terms of up to three years under the Supreme Court's previous interpretation of the Military Service Act that said religious beliefs or conscience were not valid reasons to refuse mandatory service.
Conscientious objectors were soon expected to have the option of alternative service, although the period and type of service have yet to be decided.
South Korea's defense ministry is holding its second public hearing on alternative service on Friday, a ministry statement said.
The hearing is discussing whether requiring conscientious objectors to serve 36 months of alternative service is punitive or is needed to deter potential abuse of conscientious objection to shirk mandatory military service.
The 36 months of alternative service compares with 18 months of mandatory army service by 2022.

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - A Honduran court convicted seven people on Thursday for the 2016 murder of indigenous land rights campaigner Berta Caceres, who led opposition to the construction of a hydroelectric dam on the ancestral lands of her Lenca tribe.
The seven men face up to 30 years in jail, while four of them could spend even longer behind bars as they were also convicted of attempting to kill Mexican activist Gustavo Castro, who was with Caceres during the attack.
Castro was wounded, but survived by playing dead until the gunmen left.
Caceres was shot and killed at her home on March 2, 2016 after receiving death threats over her challenges to the $50 million Agua Zarca dam that threatened to displace hundreds of indigenous Lenca.
Caceres won the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize in 2015 for leading opposition to the dam.
Among those convicted on Thursday was an employee of the DESA construction company behind the project, an active duty military officer plus a retired officer who was a DESA employee.
Sentencing is scheduled to take place in January.
One defendant was exonerated, said court spokesman Melvin Duarte.
Local and international humanitarian organizations nonetheless criticized the convictions as inadequate as they did not touch other company executives.
""Justice here was not complete because the DESA business owners have not been investigated or prosecuted, although they are the masterminds of the crime,"" said Olivia Zuniga, a daughter of Caceres.
DESA has rejected accusations that it was responsible for Caceres' murder.

DESA executive Roberto David CAstillo has been accused by legal officials in Honduras of helping to direct the crime and is being tried separately.

A key plank of President Xi Jinping's sweeping anti-corruption campaign has been the drive to repatriate overseas fugitives suspected of corruption and economic crimes through widely publicized operations dubbed ""Fox Hunt"" and ""Sky Net"".
But China has had limited success in securing cooperation from western countries, including the United States, Canada and Australia, where many of its most-wanted suspects reside, largely because of what those governments see as a lack of transparency and due process in China's judicial system.
In a brief statement, China's National Supervision Commission said that with Bulgaria's help, Yao Jinqi had been extradited back to China.
""This is the first time we have successfully extradited a bureaucrat suspected of work-related crimes from an EU member state,"" it said.
Yao was a county-level official in China's eastern province of Zhejiang, and fled the country in December 2005 after being investigated for taking bribes, the commission said.
Yao, who was the target of an Interpol red notice, was detained by Bulgarian police on Oct. 17, and a Sofia court later approved his extradition to China, it added. 
It was not possible to ascertain if Yao has been given legal representation in China or to contact any family members for comment.
Many other graft suspects have given themselves up and come back to China under their own volition, according to the Chinese government, though rights groups have expressed concern that China has sometimes put pressure on their families to achieve this.

The visit by the prince, the kingdom's de facto ruler, to the summit of industrialized nations is fraught with controversy over the killing of Saudi journalist Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October.
The killing of the Washington Post columnist, a critic of the crown prince, has strained Saudi Arabia’s ties with the West and battered Prince Mohammed’s image abroad. Saudi Arabia has said he had no prior knowledge of the murder.
“I am intending to speak with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. The message that I give will be very clear ... on this issue of Jamal Khashoggi but also on the issue of Yemen,” she told reporters on the flight to Buenos Aires.
“We want to see a full and transparent investigation in relation to what happened and obviously those responsible being held to account,” she said on Khashoggi's killing.
Western nations are calling for an end to the Saudi-led military campaign in neighboring Yemen, which was launched by Prince Mohammed, as a humanitarian crisis there worsens.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A human rights law group contracted by the State Department to interview refugees as part of an investigation into atrocities against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar has found that there is a reasonable basis to conclude that genocide was committed - even though the U.S. government stopped short of saying so. 
A report due to be released on Monday by the Washington-based Public International Law and Policy Group (PILPG) will also say there was a reasonable basis to conclude that the Myanmar military committed crimes against humanity and war crimes, as well as genocide.
A U.S. State Department report released in September, which relied on PILPG research, found that Myanmar's military waged a ""well-planned and coordinated"" campaign of mass killings, gang rapes and other atrocities against the Rohingya.
But it stopped short of describing the crackdown as genocide or crimes against humanity, an issue that U.S. officials said was the subject of fierce internal debate that delayed the report's rollout for nearly a month.
A declaration of genocide by the U.S. government, which has only gone as far as labeling the crackdown ""ethnic cleansing,"" could have legal implications of committing Washington to stronger punitive measures against Myanmar. This has made some in the Trump administration wary of issuing such an assessment.
In an advisory on Thursday announcing the planned release of the legal analysis of its investigation, PILPG said it would reveal that ""there is a reasonable basis to conclude that war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide were committed against the Rohingya population.""
PILPG based its report on more than 1,000 interviews with Rohingya refugees who fled to Bangladesh. The group said its mission was conducted in March and April ""to provide an accurate accounting of the patterns of abuse and atrocity crimes.""
The September State Department report was released in low-key fashion nearly a month after U.N. investigators issued a report accusing Myanmar’s military of acting with ""genocidal intent"" and calling for the country’s commander-in-chief and five generals to be prosecuted under international law.
State Department officials have said the objective of the U.S. government investigation was not to determine genocide but to ""document the facts,"" and it would be up to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to make a ""legal"" designation in the future.
Pompeo has urged Myanmar's government to investigate abuses against the Rohingya and hold accountable members of its security forces and others who were responsible.
A top State Department official said in September those responsible could be held accountable for genocide and crimes against humanity.

The military in Myanmar, previously known as Burma, where Buddhism is the main religion, has denied accusations of ethnic cleansing and says its actions were part of a fight against terrorism.

Poppy production rose to an estimated 30,600 hectares (75,600 acres) by June 2017 from 25,200 hectares (62,300 acres)
in June 2015, according to the joint report published on Thursday by the Mexican government and the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).
That expanse would cover an area about the size of the U.S. city of Philadelphia.
Mexico is the top source of the heroin trafficked to the United States, which has seen a sharp spike in overdose deaths that have been amplified by the mixing of the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl with heroin, according to U.S. authorities. 
Violent drug gangs have been battling over opium-producing territory in Mexico, where killings have climbed to the highest level seen in records going back to 1997.
The report marks just the second time Mexico has released U.N.-backed data on opium cultivation after an initial report in 2016 that used a different methodology.
In the past, the U.S. government had been skeptical of Mexican drug data.
""This was a big advance,"" said Antonino De Leo, the top UNODC official in Mexico. ""One of our key tasks everywhere is to build trust between partners.""The U.N.-Mexico report suggested a lower total area of poppy cultivation than data from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, which said in a report issued last month that Mexico's crop rose to 44,100 hectares (109,000 acres) last year.
De Leo said he could only comment on the U.N. report, which was carried out under the technical guidance of the Vienna-based Illicit Crop Monitoring Program, which has a global mandate to strengthen monitoring around the world.
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who takes office on Saturday, has pledged to move away from Mexico's military-led battle against drug gangs and to attack the poverty that drives many small farmers to grow illegal drugs. 
He has pledged to boost development spending in Mexico's poor south, such as Guerrero state, one of the top opium- producing areas as well one of the most violent.

Lopez Obrador's pick for interior minister has also backed creating a legal market for the medicinal use of poppy crops.

Merkel and German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz will resume their travel to Buenos Aires early on Friday, but the long flight time means they will arrive after world leaders start their discussions.
The government's Airbus A340 aircraft carrying Merkel and her delegation to the G20 summit turned around after technical problems surfaced an hour into the 15-hour flight, and landed safely at the Cologne-Bonn airport.
The airplane captain told passengers he had decided to land after the ""malfunction of several electronic systems"", but said there had been no security risk.
Merkel and other passengers initially remained on board the aircraft, called ""Konrad Adenauer"", as mechanics inspected its brakes and several fire engines waited nearby, according to a Reuters reporter on board.
No details were immediately available about the cause of the technical issues. The German military blog Augengeradeaus reported that the plane's transponder was transmitting the code 7600 which refers to a radio malfunction.
Later, the delegation traveled by bus to a hotel in Bonn. Delegation sources said a different government plane would fly Merkel and Scholz to Madrid, where they would switch to a commercial carrier for the final leg of the trip.
The delay will complicate Merkel's schedule at meeting where the G20 members already expect to face very difficult negotiations on myriad issues.
Merkel, who had planned bilateral meetings with the presidents of the United States, China, Russia and India, was unlikely to arrive in Buenos Aires until Friday evening, German government sources said. It was not immediately clear which bilateral meetings would have to be rescheduled.

Scholz was grounded on the same A340 aircraft last month after an International Monetary Fund meeting in Indonesia, according to German media reports. They said the issue involved damage caused by rodents.

May and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will both be in Argentina for the two-day meeting of the most industrialized nations but are not yet scheduled to meet one-on-one.
She is keen not to alienate allies around the world as Britain prepares to leaves the European Union next year in its biggest foreign and trade policy shift in more than 40 years.
But the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of the Crown Prince, in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October has put a spotlight on London's ties with Riyadh. 
Britain has come under pressure to cease arms sales to Saudi Arabia because of the high death toll in air raids by the Western-backed Saudi-led coalition in Yemen.
The G20 summit in Buenos Aires will be the first major international event Prince Mohammed has attended since Khashoggi's murder. 
""We have been engaging with the Saudi government in recent weeks in the wake of the murder of Mr Khashoggi and we have been doing so in order to deliver a message that we want full accountability and full transparency,"" the senior British official said, when asked if May would shake the crown prince's hand.
""If that opportunity arises for the prime minister to repeat that message and also to deliver important messages, in relation to Yemen for instance, then I'm sure she will take the opportunity to do so ... Engagement is important if we are to address these issues.""

She will use a two-day trip to the Group of 20 summit in the Argentine capital Buenos Aires to promote both her deal and Britain's post-Brexit role on the global stage.
""Our relationship with the EU will remain close. A free trade area with no tariffs, fees, charges, quantitative restrictions or rules of origin checks ... International firms that have invested in UK production or use European bases to supply the UK market will benefit from these arrangements,"" she will say during a session on trade at the summit on Friday, according to extracts provided by her office.
May will also push the case for reform of the World Trade Organization, a senior British official said, including increasing transparency, updating dispute settlement processes and promoting trade in services and digital alongside goods.
""For the first time in more than four decades, the UK will have an independent trade policy. We will play a full and active role on trade on the global stage, working with friends new and old, at a time of unprecedented global interconnectedness,"" May will say.
May, who is only the second British prime minister to travel to Argentina, and the first to visit Buenos Aires, will also discuss trade during a series of bilateral meetings with other leaders, including Argentinian President Mauricio Macri and Chilean President Sebastian Pinera. 
The British official said the relationship between Britain and Argentina, who fought a war in 1982 over the British-ruled Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic, was ""moving in a positive direction"".
Britain is expected to announce that it will create a post of trade envoy to Buenos Aires following May's talks with Macri. 
Britain and Argentina announced this week that they had agreed to provide an additional flight between South America and the Falklands, which Argentina still claims.

320,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2018 05:08PM ET</span>",Report says Syria shot down Israeli war plane but Israel denies it,"AMMAN (Reuters) - Syria's air defense forces shot down an Israeli war plane and four missiles on Thursday, Russia's RIA news agency said citing a Syrian security source, but Israel's military said the report was bogus.
The source said the missiles aimed at the town of Kiswah, south of the capital Damascus, were struck before they reached their targets.
The area where the incident is said to have occurred is where Hezbollah, a group backed by Iran, has its communications and logistics hub for southern Syria near the Israeli border, according to two senior regional intelligence sources.
Israel is concerned that Iran’s growing presence in Syria poses a threat to its own security and has struck dozens of Iranian and Iran-backed positions in Syria over the course of the country's seven-year conflict.
The Israel Defence Forces said in a statement on Twitter: ""In the course of Syrian ground-to-air missile fire, (Israel's) air defences sighted a single trajectory toward an open area of the Golan Heights.""
""At this stage it remains unclear whether there was indeed an impact in our territory. Our forces are scouring the area. Furthermore, the report about a strike on an Israeli aircraft or an Israeli aerial target are bogus,"" said the statement.
Earlier, Syrian state media said Syrian air defenses shot down ""hostile targets"" flying over the town of Kiswah.
A Syrian opposition figure familiar with the area said its proximity to the Syrian Golan Heights made it a hub for the recruitment of Iranian-backed militias and their deployment across the strategic border area with Israel. 
""Israel has targeted this area because the Syrian army barracks there have become a recruiting ground for Hezbollah and their militias to deploy in Quneitra,"" Said Seif told Reuters. 
Iran is a key ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and supports a number of militias that have fought alongside the Syrian army and its allies. 
Tehran has in recent months expanded its military presence in southern Syria after insurgents were driven out with Hezbollah, by far the biggest of the Iranian-backed militias expanding its foothold there, according to regional security sources.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - G20 member nations were still struggling to reach agreement on major issues including trade, migration and climate change as world leaders began arriving in the Argentine capital ahead of a summit starting on Friday. 
""This is not a good year for multilateralism,"" said a German government source about talks on a final statement that the leaders are due to issue at the end of their meeting on Saturday. The negotiations are ""very, very difficult,"" the official told Reuters.
The official offered no details on the points of dispute, but global trade tensions, fueled by President Donald Trump's launch of a trade war against China, are expected to dominate this year's gathering of the Group of 20, an unwieldy club of the world's industrialized countries.
Trump's skepticism that global warming is caused by human activity also raised questions about what the statement will say on the issue.
This year's G20 gathering is expected to be one of the most consequential summits since the group's leaders first met in 2008 to plan how to contain the economic crisis.
Financial and commodities markets are closely watching the outcome of the summit, especially the planned meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday. 
A slowdown in the global economy will worsen if Trump presses ahead with plans to further increase tariffs on some $200 billion of Chinese imports to 25 percent, OECD Secretary General Angel Gurria told Reuters.
Gurria said the impact of existing U.S. trade tariffs of 10 percent on Chinese goods amounted to a loss of 0.2 percent of global gross domestic product by 2020. 
""If you jack the tariffs up to 25 percent and then others retaliate, the impact could go all the way up to almost 1 percent,"" he said.
Argentina, this year's G20 president, has stressed the importance of the summit as a consensus-building forum. But the divisions have only highlighted how fractured the grouping has become on key global issues.
""After 2-1/2 days of talks and very short nights, some two-thirds of the paragraphs have been okayed,"" said a G20 official involved in drafting the statement.
""Now, trade, climate, migrants, refugees, multilateralism, steel - which are really the thorny issues - remain without agreement.""
An Asian delegate told Reuters the closed-door discussions were ""moving very very slowly - so slowly that I think we will have to stay in this room past midnight, again.""
Financial markets though are less concerned about the ability of the leaders to present a united front and more anxious about the outcome of key bilateral meetings. Wall Street edged lower on Thursday amid jitters over Trump's meeting with Xi. 
Trump said on Thursday he was open to a trade deal with China but was not sure he wanted one.
""I think we're very close to doing something with China but I don't know that I want to do it,"" Trump told reporters.
Trump's hardline trade adviser, Peter Navarro, will attend the meeting between Trump and Xi, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters.
China, for its part, is hoping for ""positive results"" in resolving the trade dispute with the United States, the commerce ministry said on Thursday.
The United States has levied additional duties of between 10 percent and 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese goods this year as punishment for what it calls China's unfair trade practices, with the 10 percent tariffs set to climb to 25 percent next year. China has responded with its own tariffs. 
NO PUTIN MEETING
One leader Trump will not be seeing in a one-to-one meeting is Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump on Thursday abruptly canceled their planned bilateral talks, citing Russia's seizure of Ukrainian vessels.
""Based on the fact that the ships and sailors have not been returned to Ukraine from Russia, I have decided it would be best for all parties concerned to cancel my previously scheduled meeting in Argentina with President Vladimir Putin,"" he tweeted.
Roughly an hour earlier, he had told reporters he would probably meet with Putin at the summit and said it was ""a very good time to have the meeting."" 
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters on Air Force One that Trump made the decision not to meet Putin after speaking with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, White House chief of staff John Kelly and national security adviser John Bolton.
A Russian diplomatic source said afterwards that Trump and Putin still needed to meet to discuss the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty. Trump's administration has accused Russia of non-compliance with the 31-year-old missile accord and warned it will pull out of the deal as a result. The Kremlin denies violating the pact.
""We still have to discuss the INF. This is important. We still need a full scale meeting,"" the source told Reuters.
This year's G20 summit is also grappling with how to handle the presence of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler arrived in Buenos Aires on Wednesday under a cloud of controversy over the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in a Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October.
Argentine President Mauricio Macri said the allegations against the prince may be discussed during the G20 summit. Saudi Arabia has said he had no prior knowledge of the murder.
As the leaders arrived, Argentine security forces began locking down the central business district in Buenos Aires on Thursday. Streets and shops were noticeably emptier. 

The government has declared Friday a national holiday and urged the capital's residents to leave to avoid travel chaos caused by the security lockdown. Major protests are also due on Friday.

324,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>",Italy set to name Egyptian suspects over disappearance of student: sources,"By Domenico Lusi
ROME (Reuters) - Italian prosecutors will next week place under official investigation two members of Egypt's security forces over their alleged involvement in the 2016 disappearance of student Giulio Regeni, judicial sources said.
Regeni, a 28-year-old PhD student, disappeared in Cairo in January 2016. His body was found almost a week later and a post mortem showed he had been tortured before his death.
Italian and Egyptian investigators have been working together to try to solve the crime and have held regular meetings in Rome and Cairo to pool their information.
Two sources with direct knowledge of the matter in Rome said Italy was increasingly frustrated at the slow pace of the investigation and had decided to press ahead unilaterally and register the names of the Egyptian suspects.
Italian media reported on Thursday that seven suspects would be placed under investigation, but a senior legal source told Reuters that only two men, both members of Egypt's National Security Agency, were certain to be placed under investigation.
Egyptian officials have repeatedly denied any involvement in Regeni's death. The general prosecutor's office in Cairo said it had no comment to make beyond a statement it issued on Wednesday following a meeting between Italian and Egyptian investigators.
That statement said that the two sides had agreed that ""investigations are going well"" and that they would ""do everything in their power to find the perpetrators"".
Being placed under official investigation in Italy does not imply guilt and does not automatically lead to a trial. The two will be investigated for allegedly kidnapping Regeni. 
No-one is being placed under investigation at this point for torturing or killing Regeni, the sources said. 
""NO CHANGE""
The president of the lower house of parliament, Roberto Fico, confirmed that prosecutors in Rome were set to open the official investigation against Egyptian citizens.
""This is the right decision, it is strong and courageous. It is also necessary given that the Cairo prosecutor is not moving forward with this case,"" Fico told state television RAI.
He added that he had visited Cairo in September and was told that the case would soon start to move forward. ""But nothing has happened. There has been no change,"" he said.
He added that until there was progress in Cairo toward finding out who was responsible for Regeni's death, he would suspend all ties with Egypt's parliament -- a largely symbolic move that will have no major impact on bilateral relations.
Regeni disappeared on Jan. 25, 2016 -- the 5th anniversary of the start of the 2011 uprising that ended the 30-year rule of Hosni Mubarak.
Intelligence and security sources told Reuters in 2016 that police had arrested Regeni outside a Cairo metro station and then transferred him to a compound run by Homeland Security.
The case had strained ties between Egypt and Italy, which recalled its ambassador over the case. Relations were restored in August last year when Rome said it would return its envoy to Cairo and continue to search for Regeni's killers.
The Italian foreign ministry said in a statement on Thursday that finding those responsible for Regeni's ""barbarous killing"" remained the top priority for Italian-Egyptian relations.

""The foreign ministry will take the necessary steps to call upon Egyptian authorities to renew with determination the commitment, often expressed, even at the highest level, to achieve concrete and meaningful results that will allow full justice to be done,"" it said.

325,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2018 04:23PM ET</span>",Hate crimes in Canada jump 47 percent in 2017,"By Anna Mehler Paperny
TORONTO (Reuters) - Hate crimes in Canada increased 47 percent in 2017, primarily targeting Muslims, Jews and black people, according to figures released by the country's statistical agency on Thursday. 
The biggest increase was in crimes targeting Muslims, Statistics Canada reported, in a year that saw a deadly mass shooting in a Quebec mosque, followed by a government motion to study Islamophobia that itself sparked anti-Muslim sentiment.
The spike mirrors an increase in hate crimes south of the border in the United States, where they rose in 2017 for the third consecutive year, according to the FBI.
""We were shocked by the numbers - and, at the same time, we weren't,"" said Ihsaan Gardee, executive director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims. ""This increase didn't occur in a vacuum.""
Canada is not immune to rhetoric coming from the United States, said Amira Elghawaby, a board member of the Anti-Hate Network advocacy group.
""It's a porous border, not just for people and goods but for ideas.""
The statistics published Thursday include crimes reported to police that were determined to be motivated by hatred toward an identifiable group. According to victimization surveys, two-thirds of these crimes go unreported, Statistics Canada said. 
The number of hate crimes targeting Muslims more than doubled, rising to 349 from 139. The number of hate crimes targeting black people increased by 50 percent, to 321 from 214. And the number of hate crimes targeting Jewish people increased to 360 from 221.
It is not yet known whether the upward trend in hate crimes continued through 2018, which saw such high-profile incidents as a Muslim man beaten in front of his family in a parking lot and Jewish teenagers attacked walking down the street. 

""We're following this closely,"" Gardee said. ""And we'll continue to raise our voice for more coordinated action across the board.""

CARACAS (Reuters) - After a woman died while connected to a respirator at a hospital in central Venezuela last month, one of her relatives punched the attending doctor in the chest, blaming her for the woman's death.
""They think when there's no equipment or antibiotics that it's the doctor's fault,"" said the doctor at the Hospital Central in Maracay, 130 kilometers (80 miles) west of the capital Caracas. She requested anonymity for fear of reprisals.
Hospital Central was one of 62 percent of hospitals across the country where doctors say they have suffered attacks by frustrated patients' relatives, as violent acts in Venezuela's decaying medical system have become increasingly common, according to a study published on Thursday by a doctors advocacy group. 
In addition, 45 percent of hospitals reported robberies and shootings, the report showed, in the latest sign of how Venezuela's five years of recession have left the country's hospitals, once among the best in Latin America, in dire straits.
Water shortages have forced surgeons to forego operations because they cannot wash their hands, among the most basic of anti-infective precautions. A lack of medicine to prevent organ rejection has left transplant recipients suffering organ failure. And epileptic patients are struggling with seizures due to drug shortages. 
But the latest study released by the group, Doctors for Health, shows that hospitals are also suffering from a crime wave in a country with one of the world's highest murder and kidnapping rates. 
Based on a survey of doctors at 40 large hospitals across the country, the study did not ask for details about violent incidents. But many likely had to do with the lack of medicines and proper equipment, according to Julio Castro, one of the Doctors for Health leaders. 
""That usually happens when a parent comes with their asthmatic child, for example, and the doctor has to tell them that there is no medicine,"" Castro said. ""The situation has been getting worse over time, even in just the past couple of months.""
Another problem is that many public hospitals are located in dangerous neighborhoods, where clashes between rival gangs are common, Castro said.
Doctors for Health was formed in 2014 by physicians, including some who are members of the opposition-led National Assembly, to draw attention to what they saw as a deteriorating health system under socialist President Nicolas Maduro, and to collect data in the absence of official statistics. 
Venezuela's Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Maduro has said crime statistics published by opposition-linked groups exaggerate the extent of criminality to spread paranoia, while he blames an ""economic war"" by the United States and Venezuelan elites for the country's woes.
This year marked the first time the poll asked doctors about the security situation.

The study also found that half of hospitals suffered from water and electricity cuts and lacked X-ray machines, while 42 percent lacked working ultrasound devices.

""The Azov route is being actively used for Russian grain exports during the river navigation period, so in the autumn-to-winter time, volumes of shipments via this route go down,"" TASS quoted the ministry as saying. 
""So the current situation (Russia-Ukraine standoff) is not expected to bring any serious changes (to grain exports).""
Russia seized three Ukrainian navy ships and their crews on Sunday near the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow annexed in 2014, over what it said was their illegal entry into Russian waters - a charge Ukraine strongly rejects.
Ukraine said on Thursday that two Ukrainian Azov Sea ports, Berdyansk and Mariupol, were effectively under blockade by Russia as vessels were being barred from leaving and entering. Moscow denied it was restricting shipping, saying it had not heard of any problems.
Russia and Ukraine are among the world's biggest grain exporters. 
Kiev has temporarily imposed martial law in parts of Ukraine over the crisis. However, the country's acting agriculture minister told Reuters on Wednesday that martial law was not affecting Ukrainian grain shipments from ports on the Azov Sea so far and they could be diverted to the Black Sea if necessary.

The seizures came a month after a woman blew herself up in the center of the Tunisian capital and wounded 15 people in an attack that broke a period of calm after dozens died in militant attacks three years ago.
Tunisia was the only country to oust a long-serving autocrat during the ""Arab Spring"" uprisings without triggering large scale unrest or civil war - and has won widespread praise for its democratic transition, new constitution and free elections.

International human rights organisations have frequently condemned Egypt's record under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, saying political repression is at its worst for decades.
The new High Permanent Committee on Human Rights set up by Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly, will be headed by the foreign minister and formed of representatives of various government agencies including the defence and justice ministries and the general intelligence service.
No non-governmental organisations or independent actors will be part of the committee, however, casting doubt over how effective it will be and drawing condemnation from some critics.
""The only way to improve Egypt's human rights image is to improve the human rights situation, not to create more committees,"" Gamal Eid, founder and director of the Arab Network for Human Rights Information, told Reuters.
""Attempting to build a fence around a rubbish dump does not negate the presence of garbage and the smell of it,"" he said.
Jamal Fahmi, a member of the state-funded National Council for Human Rights said members of the new agency were ""not even qualified to listen to any observations on human rights"".

Since winning election in 2014, Sisi has presided over a crackdown that has swept up both Islamist opponents and liberal activists. Supporters say he is working to keep Egypt stable as it recovers from political chaos after a 2011 uprising and faces deep economic challenges.

KIEV/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - President Petro Poroshenko said on Thursday Ukraine was on the cusp of securing its own independent church, snapping centuries-old ties to a Russian clergy that Kiev accuses of meddling in its affairs. 
Poroshenko's comments came after the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Istanbul, home to the global spiritual leader of Orthodox Christians, announced it had drafted a constitutional charter for an ""autocephalous"", or self-governing, Ukrainian church. 
Ukraine's push to create an independent church has incensed Moscow at a time of escalating crisis between the two neighbors following Russia's capture of three Ukrainian vessels that Kiev fears may be a precursor to a full-scale invasion.
Relations collapsed following Russia's seizure of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and the outbreak of a Kremlin-backed insurgency in eastern Ukraine that has killed more than 10,000 people. 
""Today, at the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, historical decisions have been taken on the creation of an autocephalous Ukrainian Orthodox Church,"" Poroshenko said in a televised address. 
Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew will soon announce when the Ukrainian clergy is to meet to pick the head of the new church, Poroshenko added. 
Earlier, the Ecumenical Patriarchate said in a statement that ""the Holy and Sacred Synod drafted the Ukrainian Church's Constitutional Charter"".
CHURCH RIVALRY
Ukraine had sought the Ecumenical Patriarchate's consent to establish an independent church and won its backing in October, prompting the Russian Orthodox Church to break off diplomatic ties with the Istanbul-based Patriarchate. 
Ukraine's leadership accuses the Moscow-backed faction of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, widely known as the Moscow Patriarchate, of being a tool of the Kremlin to spread Russian propaganda and foster Russian expansionism. 
The Moscow Patriarchate strongly denies this and says it is working to promote peace in Ukraine. 
Russia accuses Poroshenko of manufacturing crises, both on the church issue and in the naval standoff that erupted on Sunday, in order to whip up Ukrainian national pride and boost his sagging popularity ahead of elections next March. 
Poroshenko said Russia had tried to thwart Ukraine's bid for church independence but added: ""The Lord was with us because we are leading a righteous struggle for our independence.""
Ukraine and Russia trace their Orthodox Christian roots to Volodymyr the Great, the prince whose baptism in 988 in Kiev led to the christianisation of the region known as ""Kievan Rus"".
Two large Orthodox Churches compete for influence in Ukraine.
The Moscow Patriarchate, which is aligned with the Russian Orthodox Church, earlier dominated in Ukraine but has been challenged by a rival, known as the Kiev Patriarchate, formed after the 1991 break-up of the Russian-dominated Soviet Union.

Support for the Kiev Patriarchate swelled after the annexation of Crimea. It supports church independence and Ukraine's closer integration with the West.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's government on Thursday said it would ask a judge to preventively detain four ex-police officers involved in the controversial shooting death of an indigenous Mapuche man in the Araucania region of south-central Chile.
The four men are slated to appear in court on Friday, Interior Minister Andres Chadwick told reporters, after a judge on Thursday ordered their arrest on allegations that include obstruction of justice and homicide. 
""The investigation is bearing fruit and our government will continue to seek truth to ensure that justice is served in the case of the death of this indigenous man,"" Chadwick said.
The four ex-police officers, who were removed from the service after the shooting, could not be immediately reached for comment.
The court date comes nearly two weeks after Camilo Catrillanca, the grandson of a local indigenous leader, was shot in the head during a police operation in a rural community near the town of Ercilla, 480 miles south of Santiago.
The incident sparked fury among opposition parties and human rights activists, triggering widespread protests throughout Chile.
The administration of Chilean center-right President Sebastian Pinera has increasingly come under political pressure to seek justice in the case.
Chilean police initially said it was unclear who shot Catrillanca because none of the members of the special forces unit that handled the raid had worn body cameras.
But one of the policemen involved was later spotted in media footage wearing a camera. The policeman told investigators he had destroyed the camera's memory card.
The region's Mapuche indigenous residents have long accused the state and private companies of taking their ancestral land, draining its natural resources and using undue violence against them. Their communities are among the poorest in Chile.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's government is reviewing its diplomatic presence in Cuba, officials said on Thursday, after another staff member developed the same mysterious health problems that first began affecting diplomats last year.
Canadian and U.S. diplomats in Havana first began complaining of dizziness, headaches and nausea in the spring of 2017. The United States reduced embassy staffing in Cuba from more than 50 to a maximum of 18, after more than two dozen personnel developed unusual illnesses.
Another Canadian diplomat showed symptoms over the summer, government officials said in a telephone briefing. Tests confirmed the person suffered from the same health issues that had affected a dozen other Canadian staff, spouses and their children, officials said. 
The cause of the ailments is still unknown. In April, Ottawa directed the families of Canadian diplomats in Cuba to leave the Communist-run island. 
Next week, Canadian officials will go to Cuba to review the country's diplomatic presence there. 
""We are looking at all options,"" one senior official said, but would not elaborate on what those options might be. 
Cuban officials have denied any involvement or any knowledge of what was behind the incidents. NBC News said in September that U.S. officials believe the health problems may have been caused by sophisticated electromagnetic weapons.

Symptoms have included hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, headaches and fatigue, a pattern consistent with ""mild traumatic brain injury,"" U.S. State Department officials have said.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Governments must never again use fighting terrorism as a pretext to flatten cities and stoke war as they did in Syria, Jan Egeland told Reuters on Thursday as he stepped down from his role as the U.N. humanitarian adviser on Syria.
Syria's war should never have been allowed to spiral out of control, but after the missed opportunity of Kofi Annan's 2012 peace plan, the war worsened and the belligerents blamed ""terrorism"" for tactics that broke the rules of war, he said.
""Too many said that since we’re fighting terrorists we’re allowed to smash the whole place – to me that is a violation of every humanitarian principle,"" Egeland said. ""The war on terror needs to be reexamined."" 
Branding all opponents as terrorists made it harder to negotiate, to do humanitarian work and to protect civilians. But Russia, the United States, Turkey, the Gulf countries, Iran and Israel all claimed to be fighting terrorism, Egeland said. 
""They’re in some sort of a power play and … many of them seem then to think they do not need to follow humanitarian law of armed conflict as they would in normal cases because they’re fighting such despicable terrorists.""
Syrian cities had been leveled like the World War Two battlegrounds of Dresden and Stalingrad. But a widow with five children in Syria's rebel-held city of Idlib should not be killed just because terrorists had moved in next door, he said. 
""She should be helped.""
Egeland said although humanitarian workers had managed a huge aid operation, they had failed to shield civilians. 
Syria's seven years of war, in which hundreds of thousands have died, has been accompanied by a faltering U.N. peace process that has achieved nothing despite having unanimous support from the U.N. Security Council.
Egeland said the big battles in most parts of Syria were over, but peace would not follow without reconciliation between Syrians and between the rivals involved in proxy wars, such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, Turkey and the Kurds, Iran and Israel, the United States and Russia. 
""There has to be an understanding that, listen, we played with a powder keg here, it went off, the civilians paid an enormous price, we learn from this now and we work together to build reconciliation.""
The people who did the killing should be not escape justice, but they all had sponsors, Egeland said.
""There was never a lack of arms, never a lack of military supplies, never a lack of cheerleaders on either side.""

ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday abruptly canceled a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Argentina, registering his disapproval of Russia's treatment of Ukraine and casting new uncertainty over U.S.-Russian ties.
Trump said he pulled out due to tensions over Russian forces opening fire on Ukrainian navy boats and then seizing them and their crew on Sunday near Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.
His decision also comes as a federal investigation into his 2016 election campaign's ties to Russia is intensifying. Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty on Thursday to lying to Congress about a proposed Trump real estate project in Russia.
""Based on the fact that the ships and sailors have not been returned to Ukraine from Russia, I have decided it would be best for all parties concerned to cancel my previously scheduled meeting in Argentina with President Vladimir Putin. I look forward to a meaningful Summit again as soon as this situation is resolved!"" Trump tweeted.
Trump's tweet from aboard Air Force One shortly after takeoff from Washington on the way to Buenos Aires for a Group of 20 summit, was a sudden turnaround.
Roughly an hour earlier, he had told reporters he would probably meet with Putin at the summit and said it was ""a very good time to have the meeting."" 
Trump had also said he would get a final report during the flight to Argentina on the tension in the region after Russia seized Ukrainian vessels near Crimea on Sunday. 
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko on Thursday accused Putin of wanting to annex his entire country and called for NATO to deploy warships to a sea shared by the two nations.
While it was unclear why there was a sudden change in plans for a meeting, holding talks with Putin now could represent bad optics for the White House at a time when the president is under scrutiny over prior plans to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.
Cohen pleaded guilty on Thursday to lying to Congress about the proposed Trump Organization skyscraper in Moscow, prompting Trump to lash out at Cohen as a ""liar"" and ""weak person."" 
AIR FORCE ONE
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters on the presidential aircraft that Trump made the decision not to meet Putin after speaking with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, White House chief of staff John Kelly and national security adviser John Bolton.
The decision appeared to catch the Kremlin by surprise. The Kremlin's spokesman said Moscow had no official information on Trump's decision, and that if true, Putin would have some extra time for a useful meeting at the G20 summit.
Differences over Ukraine, as well as Moscow's role in the civil war in Syria, have been an irritant in U.S.-Russian relations for years. 
Democratic U.S. Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey said Trump was missing an ""opportunity to redeem himself, stand up for American values, stand up for international law, stand up for our own national security interests, and he had that opportunity and instead he's abdicating it.”
“It is ironic that this President cannot find his spine to confront Vladimir Putin but can challenge the closest allies the United States has across the globe,"" Menendez said.
The administration of former President Barack Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. That in part brought ties between Washington and Moscow to their lowest point since the end of the Cold War. 
Since then, the United States has investigated Russia's possible interference in the 2016 election that Trump won. Russia has denied meddling and Trump has repeatedly said there was no collusion. 
Russia seized three Ukrainian navy ships and their crews on Sunday near Crimea over what it said was their illegal entry into Russian waters, which Ukraine denies.
Some of Ukraine's Western allies have raised the possibility of imposing new sanctions on Russia over the episode, which could deliver a blow to the Russian economy. 

Kiev is aiming to gain Western support for more economic sanctions against Moscow, secure tangible Western military help, and rally opposition to a Russian gas pipeline that threatens to deprive Ukraine of important transit revenue.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentine President Mauricio Macri said on Thursday that accusations against Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman relating to war crimes and the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi may be discussed during the G20 summit, which starts on Friday.
""Regarding the crown prince, who is attending this summit, Saudi Arabia is a permanent member of the G20. And, as such, he is attending. This issue, which has impacted the world, is on the table and it may come out in bilateral meetings or not, or in the G20 agenda,"" Macri said. 
Macri was speaking at a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron, who said he will have the opportunity to discuss the accusations with the Saudi crown prince when they meet during the summit. 
Macron said the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi was ""very serious"". 
""I believe and I hope that the investigations, both in Turkey and in Saudi Arabia, will continue to clarify the situation, both for the relatives of Mr. Khashoggi and for the international community,"" Macron said. 
Human Rights Watch (HRW) asked Argentina on Monday to use a war crimes clause in its constitution to investigate any involvement by the crown prince in possible crimes against humanity in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia has launched a military campaign. 
The rights group also asked Argentina to investigate the Saudi crown prince in connection with Khashoggi's murder six weeks ago, which has sparked international furor. 
A representative from the federal prosecutor's office assigned to review the case told Reuters on Thursday there were no updates on whether Argentina would formally investigate the HRW complaints. 
An Argentine federal judge asked the foreign ministry on Wednesday to seek information from Turkey, Yemen and the International Criminal Court in connection with the accusations. 

The Saudi crown prince arrived in Buenos Aires on Wednesday for the two-day G20 summit, which begins Friday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday displayed pieces of what it said were Iranian weapons deployed to militants in Yemen and Afghanistan, a move by President Donald Trump's administration to pressure Tehran to curb its regional activities. 
The presentation of hardware by the Pentagon, much of which was handed over by Saudi Arabia, coincides with growing concern in Congress over U.S. military support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen's civil war, which has led to a deep humanitarian crisis.
Members of Congress have escalated their opposition to Saudi Arabia after the October killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Despite administration pleas not to downgrade ties with the Saudis and thereby counter Iran, the Senate voted on Wednesday to advance a resolution to end military support for the Saudis in Yemen.
If Iran were found to be shipping arms to Yemen, Afghanistan and other countries, it would be in violation of U.N. resolutions. 
""We want there to be no doubt across the world that this is a priority for the United States and that it's in international interest to address it,"" said Katie Wheelbarger, the principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs. 
The presentation, the second such one in the last year, is part of a government-wide effort to take a harder line toward Tehran. 
Iran has denied supplying the Houthis in Yemen with such weaponry and described the Pentagon's previous arms display as ""fabricated."" 
WEAPONS TO YEMEN
The Pentagon offered a detailed explanation of why it believed the arms on display came from Iran, noting what it said were Iranian corporate logos on arms fragments and the unique nature of the designs of Iranian weaponry.
The United States acknowledged it could not say precisely when the weapons were transferred to the Houthis, and, in some cases, could not say when they were used. There was no immediate way to independently verify where the weapons were made or employed.
This included a ""Sayyad-2"" surface to air missile, which the Pentagon said had been interdicted by the Saudi government in early 2018 on the way to Houthi militants in Yemen. 
The Pentagon cited a corporate logo of an Iranian defense firm in the warhead section, which was not displayed, and writing in Farsi on the missile as evidence that it was Iranian. 
A U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, acknowledged that the Pentagon did not know if the Houthis had actually used this type of missile before. 
The Houthis, who control Yemen’s capital Sanaa, have fired dozens of missiles into Saudi Arabia in recent months, part of a three-year-old conflict that is a proxy battle between Saudi Arabia and Iran. 
Under a U.N. resolution, Tehran is prohibited from supplying, selling or transferring weapons outside the country unless approved by the Security Council. A separate U.N. resolution on Yemen bans the supply of weapons to Houthi leaders.
It was unclear what impact, if any, such public displays of weaponry will have on Iran, U.S. allies and militants in the region.
A short-range missile on display was fired just five days after U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley did a similar presentation last year.
""I haven't heard anybody say this is a political stunt. This is simply putting out in broad daylight Iran's missiles and small arms and rockets and UAVs and drones,"" U.S. special envoy for Iran, Brian Hook, told a news conference on Thursday after being asked whether the weapons display was done for propaganda reasons. 
Hook said that today Houthi rebels had fired missiles into Saudi Arabia and that while the United States had the military option on the table, the preference was to use diplomatic efforts to deal with Iran.
The United States has also long accused Iran of providing weapons to Taliban militants in Afghanistan. 
The Pentagon on Thursday displayed a number of ""Fadjr"" rockets, that it said had been provided to the Taliban. It said they were Iranian because of the unique markings on the rockets and the paint scheme, along with the markings on them.

The Taliban is known to buy weapons on the black market and defense officials could not say why they were sure these missiles and other weapons had not been simply bought by the militants.

A joint motion by parties except the Conservatives in Edinburgh's devolved parliament aims to underline the ire felt in much of Scotland which voted to remain in the EU at a 2016 referendum. They say May's Brexit deal was negotiated without taking into account their views, something the government denies.
The vote does not have any direct tangible bearing on the Brexit process but is a way of showing the strength of feeling over May's Brexit plans and how the parties say they are expected to damage the Scottish economy, which accounts for 8 percent of Britain's economy as a whole.
The group will propose a single motion opposing May's EU Withdrawal Agreement in a debate at Holyrood, which has wide-reaching powers over education, health and a portion of taxes. The only group which will not sign the motion is the Scottish Conservatives.
The motion will be backed by the pro-independence Scottish National Party and Scottish Greens and the anti-independence Labour and Liberal Democrats.
Scottish politics have been divided on constitutional lines since a 2014 referendum on independence, in which Scots voted by 55-45 percent to stay part of the United Kingdom. Agreement on big political issues has been extremely rare since then.
May visited Scotland on Wednesday in attempt to drum up public support for her Brexit deal agreed in Brussels last weekend, which she says suits all corners of Britain. 
""The day after the Prime Minister's stage-managed visit to Scotland, during which she failed to engage with any politicians or individuals who oppose her proposals, this unique and positive cooperation between four of the five parties at Holyrood indicates Scotland's strength of feeling on Brexit and the Prime Minister’s untenable position, as well as illustrating the isolation of the (Conservatives) on this matter,"" they said in a joint statement.

Britain's 52-48 percent 2016 vote to leave the EU strained the ties of the four-nation United Kingdom because England and Wales voted to leave but Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to stay.

Lajcak was President of the United Nations General Assembly when the migration pact was adopted and had earlier threatened to quit if his country did not support it.
The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration was approved in July by all 193 member U.N. nations except the United States, which backed out last year, and is due to be ratified formally in December.
The pact was conceived after the biggest influx of migrants into Europe since World War Two, many fleeing conflicts and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and beyond.

RAFAH (Reuters) - On many days, Hamza Abu Shalhoub is the only person sitting inside the derelict VIP lounge of what used to be Gaza International Airport. 
Hemmed in by Egyptian border posts to the south and Israeli watchtowers to the east, he makes a living by trying to trap and sell songbirds, using other caught birds as lures.
Goldfinches are the real prize, he says, because they still sing in captivity. He can make $30 for a goldfinch in the market, but has only ever caught one, and usually makes do with lesser catches. 
His older brother Shadi, 24, has had more luck, catching 12 goldfinch since he started a decade ago.
It's not much of a job, rising at dawn every day to spread their nets among the garbage-and-debris strewn former airport buildings. But with poverty rife and youth unemployment at 70 percent in Gaza, Shalhoub said he did not have much choice.
He left school seven years ago at the age of nine.
""When I was at school I dreamt of becoming a teacher, but my father took me out of school to help him earn money for the family,"" he said, sitting in winter clothes and warming himself in front of a pot of coffee on an open fire.
His favorite subjects were English and Arabic, he said.
""I want to go back to class, but there is no way now because I left school in Grade Four.""
To snare the birds, the brothers tie a string to the leg of a captured goldfinch. They hope the sight of a bird on the ground will tempt wild birds to come down, thinking there are worms there to be eaten.
Once the birds land, they flip the nets onto them. They also place three recorders around the airfield, playing sounds of birds. They mostly catch smaller birds, which only fetch about $1.5 but still put food on the table.
The brothers chosen hunting ground is itself a symbol of thwarted Palestinian hopes for sovereignty and economic independence, as the Palestinians' only direct link to the outside world that was not controlled by Israel or Egypt.
Former U.S. President Bill Clinton attended the opening ceremony on Dec. 14, 1998, and it was used for a short time by visiting dignitaries, including South Africa's former President Nelson Mandela.
But Israel destroyed the runway in early 2001, a few months after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. The Israeli government deemed it a security threat at the height of the second Palestinian uprising known as the Al-Aqsa Intifada.
Israel withdrew its settlers and soldiers from Gaza a few years later, in 2005, but maintains tight control of Gaza's land, air and sea borders, while Egypt controls access from the south.
Israel says the restrictions are to stop weapons entering the Strip and to isolate Hamas, the Islamist movement which has controlled Gaza’s two million population since 2007.
But the economic plight of the Strip has fueled anger. A World Bank report in September said Gaza's economy was collapsing, citing ""a combination of war, isolation, and internal division"". 
As the conflict grinds on, few now even remember that Gaza once had an airport. But Abu Shalhoub, although too young to remember it in operation, sits among the surviving fragments that are a daily reminder.
""I dreamt that the airport was rebuilt,"" he said during one break in hunting. ""I have dreamt I was a passenger and I traveled in a plane.""

""I also dreamt I was back in class.""

The ""Returning From Germany"" campaign, launched by the interior ministry last week, offers financial incentives to people who want to return voluntarily and uses the slogan ""Your country! Your future! Now!"".
The ministry said, in accompanying publicity material, that the campaign only targeted illegal migrants - though the word ""illegal"" does not appear on the posters pasted up on billboards in around 80 cities.
Yann Leretaille, founder of the start-up 1aim, said he drafted the open letter and posted it online after foreign members of his staff contacted him, concerned that the message was aimed at them.
""I have launched this movement in the hope that the federal government will understand the negative, perhaps even catastrophic impact of this campaign, culturally and economically,"" he wrote in the letter since signed by 60 other entrepreneurs.
""I urge the federal government: Put an end to this campaign immediately and remove these hate-filled, discriminatory posters!""
Interior minister Horst Seehofer did not immediately respond to the open letter https://berlinunite.com - but has said in the past that the government must respond to public concern over migration to see off far-right challengers.
Germany remains deeply divided over migration three years after Chancellor Angela Merkel opened Germany's borders to more than a million migrants, many of them fleeing poverty and conflict in Africa and the Middle East.
On its website, the ministry said: ""The action is intended to inform people about current possibilities for voluntary departure and reintegration. The campaign is not targeted at people who live legally in Germany. The legality of their presence here is not in question.""
The posters in English, Farsi, French, Arabic, Russian and Pashtu are decorated with the flags of many refugees' home countries. On Berlin's metro, many of the posters have already been scrawled over with obscene graffiti.

""With joy I pay my taxes - which then are spent on an anti-migrant campaign,"" Maria Skora, a Polish researcher in Berlin, told Reuters. ""The fact I am not directly targeted by this campaign because I'm an EU citizen is just sheer luck... I am appalled!""

Highlanders' know-how and risk management strategies have long helped guard against the dangers of avalanches, known in German as ""the white death"".
Anti-avalanche measures began as early as the mid-19th century, when railroads began to snake through the high Alps, and scientific research began in earnest a century later.
""Over the centuries, the alpine population has developed strategies to counteract this danger. These include training of search dogs such as the well-known St Bernards, analyses of snow cover, documentation of avalanches, protective measures for homes, training of mountain guides and the passing on of stories,"" the Swiss government said, welcoming the UNESCO honor.
""This technical, social and cultural repertoire is constantly renewed by the population and by experts.""
UNESCO, in its citation for the addition to its list of ""intangible assets"", said: ""Nowadays, modern tools such as measurement instruments and risk mapping complement traditional knowledge, which continues to be developed and adjusted on the ground by knowledge bearers.""
Swiss broadcaster SRF traced widespread safeguarding efforts to the winter of 1951, when nearly 100 people died in around 1,300 avalanches.
""It became clear then that you either evacuate whole valleys or else invest a lot,"" SRF quoted historian Christian Rohr as saying. 
As a result, mountain dwellers built up protective forests, triggered snowslides proactively and drew up maps of danger areas.
Research even served military interests during World War Two as defense planners envisioned using snow and avalanches against potential invaders, Rohr said.

346,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2018 11:25AM ET</span>",Fractured France: Diesel tax protests expose Macron's Achilles' heel,"By Richard Lough
BEAUVAIS, France (Reuters) - Hunched over a burning oil drum on a traffic island, protesters in yellow vests line up to decry France's punishing fuel taxes and spiraling living costs, blaming a president who they see as detached from the everyday struggles of life outside the city.
For two weeks, the anti-diesel tax protests have played out at roadblocks across France, and even on Paris's Champs Elysees, representing one of the biggest and most-sustained challenges to Emmanuel Macron's authority since his election last year.
The unyielding initial response from the 40-year-old president, a former investment banker, has only reinforced a view among the hard-pressed middle-class and blue-collar workers that he is part of an urban elite contemptuous of their world.
Nowhere is that more keenly felt than in small villages, commuter towns and new-build city outskirts, where Macron's move to scrap a wealth tax, increase a social welfare levy and raise fuel duties has deepened a sense of marginalization. 
""In France, there's always existed a divide between the big cities and outlying areas. But these days the gulf is growing wider and wider,"" protester Stephan Hirelle said.
Macron's 2017 election win upended French politics, bringing to office a political outsider who promised an alienated electorate that his administration would reconnect with the grassroots, create jobs and revive the economy.
A year and a half on, it is a similar vein of anti-establishment anger spurring the yellow vests, a spontaneous protest movement that caught Macron off-guard and could spell trouble for his ambitions in next year's European elections.
Diesel pump prices may have been the trigger, but the protests -- in which adherents don the high-vis jackets all French motorists must carry -- have tapped deeper grievances. 
Hirelle and his comrades, who count among them a truck driver, pensioners and blue collar workers, bemoan the decline of French industry, the government's failure to protect local jobs from China's clout, and what they see as the selfish interests of the political elite. 
Similar resentments helped propel U.S. President Donald Trump to power and have underpinned populists across Europe. 
The unrest has pushed Macron's approval ratings to record lows of barely 20 percent. In surveys, he trails far-right leader Marine Le Pen ahead of next May's European vote.
""There's a total disconnect between him and us,"" said Jean-Marie Camus as trucks and passing cars blared their horns in support. ""What he says counts for nothing. Taxes keep going up. Essentially, it's a declaration of war.""
PERIPHERAL FRANCE 
Camus and his comrades are hunkered down on a traffic island sandwiched between a motorway toll station and an out-of-town commercial center that sprawls along a 1 km strip on the outskirts of Beauvais, a town 75 km (45 miles) north of Paris that is a base for low-cost airline Ryanair.
In a scene repeated across France, the area's hypermarkets and fast-food restaurants have fueled the demise of artisan businesses in villages that abut new-build estates. Public transport is often scant. The car is king, and costly to run.
Macron has long struggled to shake off the tag of ""president of the rich"" and the view that he is out of touch.
He has successfully stared down protests over reforms to the labor code, the state railways and pension system that were orchestrated by trade unions and his opponents. But the yellow vest rebellion, which enjoys broad public support, risks being far more dangerous for the president. 
On Tuesday he sought to dampen the protesters' anger, offering talks between his government and their representatives. 
The next round of fuel tax hikes -- which he says are necessary to fight climate change -- will go ahead in January, but he gave himself room to back down later, proposing a quarterly review of pump prices to ensure the tax is ""fair"". 
""I hear the people's discontent,"" he said. ""I will not allow our energy transition plan to deepen the inequalities between regions and make the lives of citizens in rural areas and peri-urban areas even more difficult.""
PUBLIC SUPPORT
Protesters on the barricades were unimpressed. Their impression of Macron has been cemented. 
On Wednesday, the Jean-Jaures Foundation, a left-leaning think-tank, published a report backing the sentiments driving the yellow-vest movement -- French households are finding it tougher to make ends meet, the report said, with basic pastimes such as trips to the cinema and restaurants out of reach.
""Having to sacrifice such simple pleasures sends a message to these people that they are slowly falling off the bottom of the vast middle class rung,"" the authors wrote. 
For now, the protest movement shows no sign of abating. Another rally is planned for Paris on Saturday, a week after hundreds of protesters clashed with riot police in the capital. 
Equally worrying for Macron are signs that public support for the ""gilets jaunes"" is wide and growing, with three-quarters of people backing the movement, according to an Elabe poll published on Wednesday. 

""There has always been a two-speed France,"" said Thierry Gregoire, speaking at a cafe in central Beauvais where patrons nursed morning glasses of beer. ""It's just Macron has accelerated the split.""

347,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2018 11:24AM ET</span>","Ukrainian leader says Putin wants his whole country, asks for NATO help","By Thomas Escritt and Andrew Osborn
BERLIN/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko accused Russia's Vladimir Putin on Thursday of wanting to annex his entire country and called for NATO to deploy warships to a sea shared by the two nations.
Poroshenko's comments to German media were part of a concerted push by Kiev to gain Western support for more sanctions against Moscow, securing tangible Western military help, and rallying opposition to a Russian gas pipeline that threatens to deprive Ukraine of important transit revenues.
His Western allies have so far not offered to provide any of these things, despite his warnings of a possible Russian invasion after Moscow seized three Ukrainian naval ships and their crews on Sunday near Crimea.
Moscow and Kiev blame each other for the incident, which took place in the narrow Kerch Strait off Crimea, the Ukrainian region annexed by Russia in 2014.
""Don't believe Putin's lies,"" Poroshenko told Bild, Germany's biggest-selling paper, comparing Russia's protestations of innocence in the affair to Moscow's 2014 denial that it had soldiers in Crimea even as they moved to annex it.
""Putin wants the old Russian empire back,"" he said. ""Crimea, Donbass, the whole country. As Russian tsar, as he sees himself, his empire cannot function without Ukraine. He sees us as his colony.""
Putin has accused Poroshenko of manufacturing the crisis to boost his flagging ratings ahead of next year's elections in Ukraine.
Volodymyr Omelyan, Ukraine's infrastructure minister, said on Thursday Russia had imposed a de facto blockade on two Ukrainian ports on the Sea of Azov by barring ships from leaving and entering the sea via the Kerch Strait.
The Kremlin denied it was restricting shipping, saying it had not heard of any problems. If there were any delays they were due to bad weather rather than politics, it said.
WARSHIPS
Poroshenko told Bild he also wanted NATO to deploy warships to the Sea of Azov. Ukraine is not a member of the U.S.-led military alliance.
NATO, which has condemned Russia's seizure of the Ukrainian ships, did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she thought there was no military solution to the crisis.
The Kremlin said Poroshenko's request appeared to be aimed at increasing tensions in the area.
The prospect of NATO warships heading to the Sea of Azov seems remote as it is shallow, access to it is controlled by Russia, and the Kremlin would likely view any attempt by the Atlantic alliance to deploy there as a hostile act. 
Poroshenko, who has temporarily imposed martial law in parts of Ukraine over the crisis, also tweeted on Thursday that he would impose unspecified restrictions on Russian citizens in his country. He spoke of banning some foreign currency and banking operations in Ukraine.
Ukraine's border service said it would only allow Ukrainian citizens to travel to Crimea via its land border with the annexed territory, while the head of the Ukrainian navy said Kiev would try to get Turkey to close the Bosphorus Strait to Russian ships. 
There were further signs that Russia was pressing ahead with its plans to fortify Crimea and turn it into what Kremlin-backed media have called a fortress.
MISSILE SYSTEMS
Russia on Thursday deployed a new battalion of advanced S-400 surface-to-air missile systems in Crimea, its fourth such battalion, TASS news agency cited a spokesman for Russia's Black Sea Fleet as saying.
Citing a Crimean security source, Interfax news agency also reported Russian plans to build a new missile early-warning radar station in Crimea next year that would be able to track ballistic and cruise missiles from a long distance.
Russia was also working on a new technical system to allow it to better track shipping around the peninsula in order to protect its maritime borders, Interfax said. 
The United States and the EU have imposed sanctions on Russia over its conduct towards Ukraine since 2014, when Moscow seized and annexed Crimea after a pro-Russian leader was toppled in Kiev.
Moscow later backed pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine in a conflict in which more than 10,000 people have been killed. Major fighting ended with a 2015 ceasefire but deadly exchanges of fire are still frequent.
Poroshenko urged Berlin to halt an undersea pipeline project that would allow Russia to supply more gas to Germany directly.
The Nord Stream 2 project is a potentially serious problem for Ukraine, which currently earns large transit fees from piping Russian gas to Europe and stands to lose out. 
""We need a strong, resolute and clear reaction to Russia's aggressive behavior,"" Poroshenko told the Funke newspaper group. ""That also means stopping the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project.""
But Germany's economy minister, Peter Altmaier, dismissed the idea that his country's commitment to the pipeline undermined efforts to de-escalate the Ukraine crisis.
Poroshenko's attempts to persuade the EU to impose new sanctions on Russia are also unlikely to bear fruit any time soon, diplomats say, given divisions within the bloc over how to deal with Moscow. 
Merkel said she would raise the Black Sea issue with Putin at a G20 summit which starts in Argentina on Friday. Putin is also due to hold talks there with U.S. President Donald Trump.

KAMPALA (Reuters) - A U.N. investigation of its widely-praised refugee program in Uganda has found corruption costing millions of dollars and misconduct.
The report by the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) showed inflated bills, fraud and non-compliance with rules among other malfeasance that caused losses for the U.N. refugee agency.
Uganda hosts more than 1 million refugees who have fled South Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo and other countries.
Uganda is praised for its open-entry refugee policy that grants aliens free movement within the country, access to public health services and small plots of land for settlement and cultivation.
The OIOS's audit covered UNHCR's operations in Uganda for 18 months from July 2016. 
""We have acknowledged serious shortcomings and have already started taking action ... (The) majority of the actions resulting from these reviews have been implemented even before the final audit report was released,"" Babar Baloch, UNHCR spokesman in Geneva told Reuters on Thursday. 
The audit showed excessive fuel use by UNHCR vehicles assigned to officials from Uganda's office of the prime minister (OPM), which manages refugees and provides contract services to UNHCR.
These include refugee registration, though UNHCR has taken over the role since allegations by whistleblowers of inflated numbers.
The audit said OPM paid $283,000 in allowances annually to dozens of its staff but ""was unable to provide to OIOS documentation to substantiate that these civil servants were working on UNHCR projects.""
Spokesmen for the OPM, the presidency and the government did not respond to calls by Reuters seeking comment. 
The report said OPM paid too much for land ostensibly to expand space for refugee registration activities and there were also potentially $7.7 million in overpayments for water supplies.
Some procurements were done without competitive bidding while others carried insufficient documentation, exposing UNHCR to losses through inflated prices and other fraud. 
The UN audit was triggered by whistleblowers who said officials may have inflated refugee numbers to skim aid and do other fraud.
An audit of refugee numbers showed Uganda has 1.1 million, nearly 25 percent less than the previously reported number. 
Those allegations angered western donors who finance the agency's efforts to cope with swelling refugee numbers in Uganda especially after a surge of violence in South Sudan in 2016.

Luis Gonzalez, the head of Mexico's human rights commission, told a conference late on Wednesday that burnt remains were found in a dump where government prosecutors said the 43 trainee teachers' bodies had been burnt by gang members who killed them. 
Independent international investigators have cast serious doubts on a government version of events that said the students were taken to the dump and burnt there, and Gonzalez cautioned the remains had not yet been identified as any of the missing students. 
He noted the dump had been a used by local gangs to dispose of bodies for some time.
The abduction and suspected massacre of the trainee teachers in the southwestern city of Iguala sparked one of the worst crises of outgoing President Enrique Pena Nieto's government.
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised to quickly launch a truth commission to get to the bottom of what happened to the students.
The case became emblematic of a surge in violence and corruption during Pena Nieto's presidency that fed the landslide victory of leftist Lopez Obrador, who takes office on Saturday.
Family members of the students have refused to accept the government's version. 
Gonzalez criticized the government's investigation for ""grave human rights violations"" and said it would be up to the incoming government to clear up the case and file charges. 
The U.N. human rights office said in a report in March that Mexican authorities had tortured dozens of people during the investigation.

DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar will more than double its naval forces by 2025 as a massive new base comes online and it expands a national service program amid a protracted dispute with neighbors which it says requires greater self-reliance.
Like its larger neighbors, the tiny but gas-rich state has used its massive wealth to launch a sweeping modernization of its military, pouring tens of billions of dollars into some of the world's most advanced weapons systems.
Qatari defense officials said the buildup has been planned for several years, and predates a Saudi Arabia-led political and economic boycott imposed since June 2017 over allegations that Doha supports terrorism - something which Qatar denies.
But they also said the tensions underscored the need to boost domestic capabilities while still hoping for an end to the dispute that has fractured a Gulf Arab bloc set up in 1981 to coordinate on political, economic and defense matters.
""You don't want to put all the burden on your friends and allies' shoulders. At some stage you have to stand up for yourself and defend yourself,"" state minister for defense Khalid al-Attiyah told reporters on a media tour of military facilities.
The row has eluded U.S. mediation efforts as Washington works on launching a proposed Middle East security alliance to act as a bulwark against Iran. Doha has said the new alliance faces a credibility risk as long as the boycott is in place.
The United States is allied to all six Gulf states. Qatar hosts Al-Udeid air base, the largest U.S. military facility in the region, while Bahrain is home to the Navy's Fifth Fleet.
Since the rift began Qatar has announced purchases of three different fighter jet systems, including 36 American F-15s, 12 French Rafale fighters and 24 Eurofighter Typhoon aircrafts.
Qatar's navy of fewer than 3,000 people is expected to balloon to 7,000 by 2025, a navy spokesman said. Construction for a sprawling new naval base south of Doha will begin early 2019.
The base is intended to accommodate 6,000 people and support some of the big-ticket recent purchases expected to arrive in the next two years, which include four Italian Corvettes and a behemoth amphibious landing platform dock.
TRAINING UP 
Analysts say the manpower challenge is enormous and the different systems, intended to shore up strategic alliances, will complicate training.
""They have to completely build up an air force and navy from scratch with very few Qatari nationals - where are they going to find the manpower to do this?"" said Pieter Wezeman, a senior researcher at Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.
""If you compare this to Belgium or Sweden which has about 10 million people to choose from and have smaller armed forces in terms of equipment versus Qatar, this is going to be a very big task.""
Qatar has just over 300,000 citizens and relies on expats from countries like Pakistan and Sudan to fill out its military.
Defense officials said they are working to get as many Qataris into the armed forces as possible but declined to disclose the current number of Qataris or foreigners who serve.
A compulsory national service program was expanded this year to 12 months from three and will begin accepting Qatari females on a volunteer basis for the first time next year.
""We will not bring foreign pilots to fly our airplanes or drive our tanks or sail our warships,"" said the state minister for defense, Attiyah.
The training challenge is front and center at Al Zaeem Air Academy, which aims to graduate a third more pilots this year and move to a larger new facility in 2019.
The first batch of six F-15s will arrive in early 2021 and use a ""minimum of two US Air Force aircrew and up to 10 contract aircrew"" until more Qatari pilots are trained, said Brigadier General Issa al-Mahannadi, who oversees the F-15 program. 
Even as it builds out its own forces, Qatar has announced ambitious plans to invest in Al-Udeid base, a strategic launchpad for U.S. operations in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
Qatari officials said they are finalizing plans for new living quarters, dining halls, and storage areas by 2022 to make the roughly 10,000 Americans there ""more comfortable.""

""The idea is to make it a permanent base from an expeditionary one"" said a military spokesman, who declined to comment on the total investment expected.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The Chinese government on Thursday ordered a temporary halt to research activities for people involved in the editing of human genes, after a Chinese scientist said he had edited the genes of twin babies.
Scientist He Jiankui said this week that he used a gene-editing technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 to alter the embryonic genes of the twin girls born this month.
He's announcement, which has not been verified, sparked an international outcry about the ethics and safety of such research.
""The nature of this incident is extremely nasty, and relevant bodies have been ordered to temporarily halt the scientific research activities of relevant personnel,"" the state news agency Xinhua said, citing the health ministry, science and technology ministry and China Association for Science and Technology.
The organizers of a conference where He claimed to have edited the genes also condemned the work on Thursday, calling it ""deeply disturbing"" and ""irresponsible"".
""Even if the modifications are verified, the procedure was irresponsible and failed to conform with international norms,"" the organizing committee of the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing, being held in Hong Kong this week, said in a statement.
The committee called for an independent assessment of He's claims.
He said gene editing would help protect the girls from infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. 
(GRAPHIC: Gene editing IMG, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2ReKG1R) 
Chinese scientists have also condemned the work and the Southern (NYSE:SO) University of Science and Technology, where He is on leave from his position as an associate professor, has announced an investigation. 
The Guangdong province Health Commission said on its website on Wednesday it and Shenzhen city had set up a team to investigate the case. 
He's filing to a Chinese clinical trials database indicates that a hospital did an ethical review of the project, but the hospital involved denied that its ethics review committee ever met to discuss the work.
He said after his presentation on Wednesday he was proud of what he had done.
The presidents of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the U.S. National Academy of Medicine (NAM) also expressed concern about He's work.
""The events in Hong Kong this week clearly demonstrate the need for us to develop more specific standards and principles that can be agreed upon by the international scientific community,"" NAS president Marcia McNutt and NAM president Victor Dzau said in a statement.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgium may have breached EU law in extending the life of two nuclear reactors because it failed to carry out a full assessment of the environmental impact, an adviser to the European Union's top court said on Thursday.
However, the Belgian authorities may be able to keep the reactors running while they rectify their procedural error, the advisor said in a recommendation to judges who will eventually rule on the case.
Reactors Doel 1 and 2 near Antwerp were scheduled to cease production in 2015, but the Belgian government decided in that year to extend their lives by 10 years.
Two environmental groups brought an action to Belgium's constitutional court seeking an annulment of that decision because no environmental assessment had taken place. The Belgian court sought the advice of the European Court of Justice.
Juliane Kokott, an advocate general of the EU court, said there were grounds for taking the view that the Belgian law to extend the lives of the reactors had been enacted without a necessary environmental study.
Opinions of the advocate general are not binding, but are followed by the EU court in most cases.
Engie Electrabel, the Belgian arm of French utility Engie that operates the reactors, noted that the opinion did not rule out that the reactors could remain running.
Sara Van Dyck, energy policy adviser at Bond Beter Leefmilieu, one of the groups that brought the action, said that while the opinion was a bit confusing, the group was happy with the advice in general.
The Doel 1 and 2 reactors have been offline since April since a leak in Doel 1's water cooling system was discovered.

Both reactors are under repair as Belgium faces a tight electricity supply situation going into winter with just two out of its seven nuclear reactors working.

TBILISI (Reuters) - The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) said on Thursday that one side in Georgia's presidential election had enjoyed an ""undue advantage"" after the candidate backed by the ruling party won a run-off.
French-born Salome Zurabishvili won 59.6 percent of the vote in Wednesday's runoff, defeating opposition candidate Grigol Vashadze, the central election commission said in the early hours of Thursday.
Zurabishvili, who served as Georgia's foreign minister from 2004 to 2005, favors balancing the ex-Soviet republic's relations with Moscow and the West. Her rival, Grigol Vashadze, had advocated a stronger pro-Western line.
Neither candidate won the necessary 50 percent to win outright in a first round of voting last month. 
Wednesday's second round was closely scrutinized by opposition and international observers for any sign that the ruling Georgian Dream party was using its control of state machinery to help Zurabishvili win.
""The second round of Georgia's presidential election was competitive and candidates were able to campaign freely, however one side enjoyed an undue advantage and the negative character of the campaign on both sides undermined the process,"" the OSCE said in its preliminary report. 
The OSCE monitoring mission said the election had been well managed, but that administrative resources had been misused during the election. 
""The campaign was marred by harsh rhetoric,"" it said. ""Increased misuse of administrative resources further blurred the line between party and state."" 
The opposition said its activists had been attacked during campaigning and complained there were many irregularities during the vote, including attempts to pressure voters and manipulate voter lists
""On election day, voters actively took part and the process was assessed positively, although the observed tracking of voters reinforced concerns about potential intimidation,"" the monitoring mission wrote.
The ruling party has denied attempting to influence the outcome of the vote unfairly. 
Constitutional changes have reduced the authority of the president and put most levers of power in the hands of the prime minister, a Georgian Dream loyalist.
The election was the last in which the president will be selected by popular vote. From 2024, presidents will be picked by an electoral college of 300 lawmakers and regional officials.
Zurabishvili's supporters say she will bring international stature to the presidency.
But her opponents have criticized her for statements that appeared to blame Georgia for a 2008 war with Russia and for remarks about minorities that some see as xenophobic.

354,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2018 08:05AM ET</span>",Trump support for Saudi prince leaves Turkey with tough choices,"By Orhan Coskun and Dominic Evans
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Eight weeks since the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, U.S. President Donald Trump's unwavering support for the kingdom's powerful crown prince has left Turkey in a bind.
The longer it confronts Saudi Arabia over who exactly ordered the operation, the more it risks looking isolated as other countries put aside their misgivings and return to business with the world's biggest oil exporter.
A prolonged standoff with Riyadh could also jeopardize Turkey's own fragile rapprochement with Washington, if it forces Trump to choose sides between the rival regional powers.
Turkey's dilemma comes to a head this week at the G20 summit of the world's main economies, where President Tayyip Erdogan and Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman could meet, according to Turkish officials.
Without naming him, Erdogan has repeatedly suggested the prince has questions to answer over the killing, while one of his advisers has said bluntly that Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler has Khashoggi's blood on his hands.
But Erdogan has avoided talking about Khashoggi's death in recent speeches, raising questions about whether he may soften his stance towards the 33-year-old heir to the throne who could be running Saudi Arabia for several decades to come.
""A meeting may take place. A final decision has not been made yet,"" senior political source said, shortly before Erdogan's departure for the summit in Argentina. 
""Saudi Arabia is an important country for Turkey ... Nobody wants relations to sour because of the Khashoggi murder.""
Erdogan has good relations with the Saudi monarch, King Salman, but ties have been strained by recent Saudi moves including the blockade of Qatar, championed by Salman's son. 
    Analysts say Erdogan sees Saudi assertiveness under the prince as challenging Turkey's influence in the Middle East.  
It was the steady drip of evidence from Turkish officials - furious over what they said was a gruesome and carefully planned assassination in their country - which fuelled global outrage at Saudi Arabia and Prince Mohammed.
Erdogan said the hit was ordered at the highest levels of Saudi leadership, and the CIA assessed the prince was directly behind it, despite vehement Saudi denials. 
But nearly two months since Khashoggi was killed and his body dismembered by a team of 15 Saudi agents, Western powers have taken little action against Saudi Arabia, a big buyer of Western arms and a strategic ally of Washington.
The most concrete U.S. step so far was a decision in mid-November to impose economic sanctions on 17 Saudi officials, including the prince's senior aide, Saud al-Qahtani.
Meanwhile Trump has stood by the crown prince, saying he does not want to jeopardize U.S. business and defying intense pressure from lawmakers to impose broader sanctions on Saudi Arabia.
SECOND THOUGHTS?
On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said there was no direct evidence connecting Prince Mohammed to Khashoggi's murder, and that any downgrading of U.S.-Saudi ties in response would hurt U.S. security.
That clear message from the Trump administration may be forcing Turkey to think again.
""Initially the objective was to pressure Trump to drop his relationship with MbS,"" said Sinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat and analyst at the Carnegie Europe think tank, referring to the crown prince.
""On the contrary, Trump seems to have decided to consolidate that relationship, and that's why there had to be a reassessment in Ankara about how to manage this,"" he said.
Ulgen said Erdogan's priority was to safeguard the modest recovery in relations with Washington since a Turkish court last month freed a U.S. pastor who had been detained for two years on terrorism charges. 
""Turkey doesn't want to endanger the political capital that it earned in Washington by pushing too far (on Khashoggi). That's the main motivation,"" he said.
Bolstered by Trump's support, Saudi officials have insisted that Prince Mohammed did not know in advance about the operation, and Foreign Minister Adel Jubeir said last week Turkish authorities had told Saudi officials that they were not accusing the crown prince of involvement.
Saudi Arabia's official news agency said trade ministers from the two countries met in Istanbul on Wednesday and would encourage Saudi investment in Turkey, and Turkish companies to take part in projects in Saudi Arabia.
Any change in Turkey's approach would likely be gradual. Erdogan made no mention of Saudi Arabia when he spoke to reporters as he left Istanbul airport on Wednesday night, but he may still choose not to meet the prince in Argentina.
""Saudi Arabia has yet to make a satisfactory statement regarding the murder in Istanbul,"" said Ilter Turan, a professor of political science at Turkey's Bilgi University.
""The Turkish government is still working on the investigation ... It's possible to say that it's a little too early for a meeting.""
Another Turkish official said the government was still assessing the Saudi request for a meeting. If the two men do hold talks in Buenos Aires, the conversation would be broadly the same as the phone call they held a month ago, he said.
""Turkey will repeat its current position at the meeting, if there is one,"" the official said. ""Turkey wants all those responsible for the murder to be brought to justice, and it's not asking for a punishment for Saudi Arabia.""

""It's not realistic to expect a major improvement from that meeting, but a contact will have been made""

ADEN (Reuters) - U.N.-sponsored peace talks between Yemen's warring parties are expected to start next week in Sweden, Britain's envoy to Yemen said on Thursday, as Western allies press for an end to the war that has pushed the country to the verge of starvation.
The United Nations is trying to reconvene talks between the Saudi-backed government led by Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and the Iranian-aligned Houthi group to agree a framework for peace and a transitional governing body. 
A previous round in Geneva collapsed in September when the Houthis failed to show up.
The outrage over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul has increased scrutiny on Riyadh's role in conflicts in the region, potentially giving Western powers, which provide arms and intelligence to the Saudi-led coalition, greater impetus for action. 
""The Sweden consultations led by the U.N. envoy will take place next week ... the political solution is the way to move forward,"" Michael Aron, the Riyadh-based British ambassador to Yemen, tweeted to the Houthis' spokesman Mohammed Abdusalam. 
Britain is a major arms supplier to Saudi Arabia and opposition politicians and human rights groups have called on the government to cease such sales due to the high civilian death toll in air raids by the coalition in Yemen. 
Germany has moved to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia over the Khashoggi killing and Denmark has suspended future approvals of weapons and military equipment exports there.
A member of Hadi's delegation told Reuters on Wednesday that the talks were due to be held on Dec. 4, but that the date could change ""depending on logistics"". 
Martin Griffiths, the U.N. envoy to Yemen, visited the Houthi-held capital Sanaa this week where he met the group's leaders. The U.N. humanitarian chief, Mark Lowcock, arrived in Sanaa on Thursday.
A spokeswoman from Griffiths' office declined to give an exact date for the talks.
""Preparations are ongoing as planned and we hope the consultations will convene in early December,"" she said.
The United Nations hopes to get an agreement on Hodeidah port, the entry point for the bulk of Yemen's commercial imports as well as the much-needed aid supplies, that will lead to a broader ceasefire.
The Houthis have agreed to hand over the management of the port to the Unted Nations, but both parties in the war still have to agree on who will hold the control over the city, especially around key facilities. 
""KEEP ROADS OPEN""
The coalition, which renewed its offensive to capture the port this month, has said taking control of Hodeidah would cut off the Houthis' main supply line and force them to adopt a softer stance on the negotiating table.
But the international community fears an all-out attack on the port could disrupt its operations and lead to a famine in the impoverished country, where an estimated 8.4 million people are facing starvation.
The United Nations has no up-to-date estimate of the death toll in Yemen. It said in August 2016 that according to medical centers at least 10,000 people had been killed. 
The United Nations' Lowcock called on authorities in Sanaa to improve the environment in which the aid agencies operate.
""Keep the ports open, keep the roads open, provide access to all the key facilities, provide our visas, release our cargos at the port,"" Lowcock told reporters in Sanaa.
""It’s essential that everybody cooperates strongly with my colleague Martin Griffiths, and goes to the talks that he hopes to convene in Sweden very soon,"" he added.
The last U.N. attempt to convene the warring parties collapsed after the Houthis asked for guarantees from the U.N. that their plane would not be inspected. They also wanted to evacuate some of their wounded to Oman for treatment.
Saudi Arabia confirmed its willingness to evacuate 50 wounded Houthi fighters as a confidence-building measure, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt told Reuters this month.
Kuwait has offered to provide planes for the parties to ensure the participation of both sides in Stockholm.
The Houthis said last week they were halting drone and missile attacks on coalition forces, responding to a demand from the United Nations. However, the group's Al Masirah TV said on Thursday the group fired a ballistic missile on the Saudi-bordering region of Najran. 
The Saudi-led coalition halted its offensive on the port city of Hodeidah, although skirmishes continued on the outskirts.

ROME (Reuters) - The Italian government passed a law that clamps down on asylum rights and boosts funds for police, handing Interior Minister and right-wing League party leader Matteo Salvini his first major legislative win.
The lower house of parliament voted 396 to 99 late on Wednesday to pass the law championed by Salvini, who took office in June in a coalition with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement. 
The new law eliminates humanitarian grounds for granting protection to refugees -- asylum that is not tied to political persecution or war. It also funnels millions of euros to law enforcement and anti-mafia administrators. 
""I'm willing to host women and children who are escaping from war ... But all the others, no,"" Salvini said on Thursday, referring to the new legislation. ""I don't want to be seen as an idiot."" 
Italy will still award asylum to war refugees or victims of political persecution. But it will no longer hand out ""humanitarian"" asylum, which was given to those who had ""serious reasons"" to flee their home country - a category that has often included homosexuals fleeing harsh anti-gay laws in Africa. 
More than 20,000 people, or 25 percent of those who sought asylum, got ""humanitarian"" protection last year, and the tens of thousands of others received it in previous years will now likely lose their legal status when their documents expire.
The League's lawmakers celebrated the passage of the law on Thursday by unfurling a banner outside the lower house of parliament that read: ""The Salvini decree is law; the good times (for migrants) are over."" 
Salvini campaigned on an anti-immigration platform against the backdrop of hundreds of thousands of migrant-ship arrivals from North Africa in recent years, and he closed the country's ports to migrant rescue ships after taking office.
Largely as a result of his hard line on immigration, the League, after winning some 17 percent in the March election, has doubled its support, rocketing past its 5-Star partner.
The League's backing is now 34 percent, compared with 25 percent for 5-Star, a Noto Sondaggi poll published this week showed.
Just before the passage of the legislation on Wednesday, Salvini reaffirmed his tough stand on immigration, saying he opposed a United Nations pact to regulate the treatment of migrants that Italy had supported, prompting Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte to call a parliamentary debate on the issue. 
The new law also foresees the use of electric tasers for the first time by local police, and increases jail time for people who promote illegal occupations of public or private buildings.
In response to a series of attacks in Europe aimed at causing mass casualties, the law heightens controls on people who rent trucks, and strips naturalized foreigners who are convicted on terrorism charges of their Italian citizenship.

Siemens exported seven gas turbines to Russia in 2015 and 2016, but they were later installed in Russia-annexed Crimea, which is subject to sanctions from the European Union. 
The bloc imposed sanctions after Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Kiev in March, 2014, and ratcheted them up as Moscow went on to back rebels fighting against government troops in east Ukraine.
Siemens said in its annual report published on Wednesday that it was fully cooperating with the authorities.
The turbines were worth 213 million euros and the investigation had been going on since May, a spokesman for the prosecutor said.
Siemens said that the turbines were ordered and delivered for a power plant project in Taman in southern Russia. But they were then transferred to Crimea by Siemens' Russian customer OAO VO TechnoPromExport and installed in new gas-fired power plants in a breach of the sales contract. 
Siemens sued OAO VO TechnoPromExport in Russia, aiming for a cancellation of the sales contract. But its case was dismissed by four consecutive courts, Siemens said.

359,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2018 07:21AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Fearing espionage, U.S. weighs tighter rules on Chinese students","By Patricia Zengerle and Matt Spetalnick
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is considering new background checks and other restrictions on Chinese students in the United States over growing espionage concerns, U.S. officials and congressional sources said.
    In June, the U.S. State Department shortened the length of visas for Chinese graduate students studying aviation, robotics and advanced manufacturing to one year from five. U.S. officials said the goal was to curb the risk of spying and theft of intellectual property in areas vital to national security. 
But now the Trump administration is weighing whether to subject Chinese students to additional vetting before they attend a U.S. school. The ideas under consideration, previously unreported, include checks of student phone records and scouring of personal accounts on Chinese and U.S. social media platforms for anything that might raise concerns about students' intentions in the United States, including affiliations with government organizations, a U.S. official and three congressional and university sources told Reuters.
U.S. law enforcement is also expected to provide training to academic officials on how to detect spying and cyber theft that it provides to people in government, a senior U.S. official said.
""Every Chinese student who China sends here has to go through a party and government approval process,"" one senior U.S. official told Reuters. ""You may not be here for espionage purposes as traditionally defined, but no Chinese student who’s coming here is untethered from the state."" 
The White House declined comment on the new student restrictions under review. Asked what consideration was being given to additional vetting, a State Department official said: ""The department helps to ensure that those who receive U.S. visas are eligible and pose no risk to national interests."" 
    The Chinese government has repeatedly insisted that Washington has exaggerated the problem for political reasons. China's ambassador to the United States told Reuters the accusations were groundless and ""very indecent.""
""Why should anybody accuse them as spies? I think that this is extremely unfair for them,"" Ambassador Cui Tiankai said.
Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet at a G20 summit in Argentina this week. 
Greater scrutiny of Chinese students would be part of a broader effort to confront Beijing over what Washington sees as the use of sometimes illicit methods for acquiring rapid technological advances that China has made a national priority. The world’s two biggest economies also are in a trade war and increasingly at odds over diplomatic and economic issues. 
Any changes would seek to strike a balance between preventing possible espionage while not scaring away talented students in a way that would harm universities financially or undercut technological innovation, administration officials said.
But that is exactly what universities - ranging from the Ivy League's Harvard, Yale and Princeton universities to state-funded schools such as University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign - fear most. They have spent much of 2018 lobbying against what they see as a broad effort by the administration to crack down on Chinese students with the change in visas this summer and a fear of more restrictions to come.
At stake is about $14 billion of economic activity, most of it tuition and other fees generated annually from the 360,000 Chinese nationals who attend U.S. schools, that could erode if these students look elsewhere for higher education abroad.

Many Ivy League schools and other top research universities, such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Stanford University, have become so alarmed that they regularly share strategies to thwart the effort, according to three people familiar with the discussions.
U.S. authorities see ample reason for closer scrutiny, pointing to recently publicized cases of espionage, or alleged espionage, linked to former students from Louisiana State University and Duke University and the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. 
   FBI Director Christopher Wray told a Senate hearing this year that his agents across the country are seeing ""non-traditional collectors (of intelligence), especially in the academic setting.""

White House adviser Stephen Miller proposed a ban early this year on student visas for all Chinese nationals, according a report to the Financial Times, and confirmed by Reuters. 
But the new measures would stop well short of such a ban, according to multiple sources. Terry Branstad, a former Iowa governor who is now ambassador to China, helped convince Trump to reject the Miller idea during a meeting in the Oval Office in the spring, one administration source said. Branstad argued that a ban would hurt schools across the United States, not just the elite universities many Republicans view as excessively liberal. 
U.S. Representative Judy Chu of California warned the administration was at risk of overreach.
    ""Our national security concerns need to be taken seriously, but I am extremely concerned about the stereotyping and scapegoating of Chinese students and professors,"" Chu, a Democrat who chairs the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, said in a telephone interview.
Already worried about restrictions, universities have mounted a pressure campaign focused on the White House, State Department and Congress and held multiple meetings with the FBI, according to lobbyists, university officials and congressional aides.
    Terry Hartle, senior vice president at the American Council on Education, told Reuters that Chinese students risked becoming ""pawns"" in the U.S.-China rivalry.  
MIT president L. Rafael Reif, and Andrew Hamilton, the president of New York University, are among several top university officials who published opinion columns recently addressing the perceived growing threat to their Chinese students.
Reif said that academic institutions recognize the threat of espionage, but any new policy needs to ""protect the value of openness that has made American universities wellsprings of discovery and powerhouses of innovation.""

The government announced the schedule and format for a five-day debate on May's Brexit deal late on Wednesday and stated that opponents would have the chance to amend the government's motion that would approve the agreement.

Leadsom confirmed on Thursday that amendments would be voted upon first, before the final vote on whether to approve May's deal. Ministers have previously voiced concerns that if any amendment were passed, it could prevent the deal from being ratified.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's national security adviser John Bolton met Brazil's far-right President-elect Jair Bolsonaro on Thursday to discuss regional security issues and build on the ideological affinity between the two leaders.
Bolsonaro is an admirer of the U.S. president and, like Trump, took the political establishment by surprise when he won office in October, riding a wave of anger against traditional politicians.
He has vowed to sweep out corruption, crack down on crime and align Brazil closely with the United States in a shift towards conservative nationalism.
A Brazilian Army helicopter hovered offshore as Bolton arrived for the one-hour visit with Bolsonaro at his beachside gated community on the south side of Rio de Janeiro.
Bolsonaro said it was ""very productive"" in a Twitter post.
The meeting was attended by Bolsonaro's future national security adviser General Augusto Heleno and future defense minister General Fernando Azevedo, both retired Army officers, and incoming foreign minister Ernesto Araujo, an anti-globalist who believes climate change theory is a Marxist invention.
Bolsonaro has threatened to follow Trump's lead and pull Brazil out of the Paris climate agreement, despite having the world's biggest rain forest in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). 
On Wednesday, he said he pushed the government to withdraw Brazil's offer to host the U.N. climate conference next year, maintaining that Brazil's sovereignty over the Amazon was at stake.
Bolton told reporters on Tuesday in Washington that Bolsonaro's election was a ""historic opportunity"" for Brazil and the United States to work together on security, economics and other issues. Thursday's meeting would prepare the ground for Trump and Bolsonaro to ""get off to a running start"", he said.
Bolton is expected to seek Brazilian support to apply pressure to Venezuela's left-wing government, which he describes as part of ""the troika of tyranny"" in the Americas, alongside Cuba and Nicaragua.
In another step following Trump, Bolsonaro plans to move the Brazilian embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, despite angering Arab countries that are big buyers of Brazilian meat. 
After visiting Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner at the White House on Tuesday, his son Eduardo Bolsonaro told reporters the move was ""not a question of if, but of when"".
There is speculation Bolsonaro's team will seek to bring Trump to the presidential inauguration in Brasilia on Jan. 1.
While Trump's attendance would be a major validation for Bolsonaro, Thiago de Aragao, a risk analyst and partner at Brasilia consultancy ARKO, said it is unlikely to happen.
""Ideological affinity is not enough to have the level of relationship Bolsonaro seeks. Trump has made it clear that he wants direct commercial benefits for the United States in its foreign ties,"" he said.
Battling a wide budget deficit as it recovers from a deep recession, Brazil cannot afford to buy billions of dollars in U.S.-made arms, for example.

There could be convergence on Venezuela, but Brazil would never agree to military action against its neighbor and could at most agree to apply sanctions, Aragao said.

CHICO, Calif. (Reuters) - For two dozen third-graders who survived the massive wildfire that largely obliterated Paradise, California, school is now the small home of their teacher, Sheri Eichar: Reading center on the couch, math in the kitchen nook, language in the corner. 
When it's time for recess, the pupils jog around the block of Eichar's suburban neighborhood in Chico, a 20-minute drive from Paradise. 
Of the 24 kids in Eichar's class at Children's Community Charter School, 20 lost their homes in the Camp Fire, which broke out near Paradise on November 8 and swept through the small mountain community, killing at least 88 people.
The blaze, which is now fully contained, is already the deadliest U.S. wildfire in a century, with 158 people still unaccounted for as search and rescue teams comb through the rubble and ash for human remains.
Many of Paradise's 27,000 residents are now settled in and around Chico after the firestorm that consumed the town and destroyed the elementary school.
Within days of the evacuation, Eichar notified her students that classes would resume in her three-bedroom home and she and her husband moved the couches around so the children can sit on the floor of their living room.
On the first day, ""The kids walked in like they did it every day of their lives,"" Eichar said, and lined up side by side on the couches. Ten to 12 students come most days, although 18 turned up on Tuesday.
""They just needed each other so bad. This fire has created such isolation for the families and these children. They just need to be together,"" she said.
MORE FUN 
Eleanor Weddig, 8, says the home is more fun than a schoolhouse.
""Well, I love it. It's like more comfortable than our classroom, the chairs are cushy,"" Weddig said. ""And anyway it's a house so it's like more fancy and stuff, and she cooks us great lunches.""
All told, 5,000 students have been displaced from Paradise schools. Eight of nine schools in the Paradise Unified School District are damaged or destroyed. 
Students left homeless are eligible under federal law to re-enroll in a school wherever they temporarily reside, said Tom DeLapp of the Butte County Office of Education. 
Officials are scrambling to identify commercial buildings, available real estate, mobile classrooms and partnerships with other agencies to keep classrooms and kids together. 
""It could be years,"" before schools are rebuilt in Paradise, DeLapp said. ""While the place burned down in 24 hours, we can't rebuild it in 24 hours.""
TEST SCORES 
Families and staff at Children's Community Charter School gathered at the Grace Community Church in Chico on Tuesday to hear about plans for recovery. 
Starting Monday, the school's 220 students will begin holding classes at a church gym in Chico. On Friday, a second charter school will squeeze into the same space.
Principal Steve Hitchko says it will be tricky. There is only one restroom, and students have missed a lot of classes.
""Will our test scores suffer? Yeah. I'm just going to be honest with you. We're going through trauma,"" Hitchko said.
At the meeting, parents voiced concerns about long commutes from new or temporary homes, counseling services and after-school programs. Children wondered whether there would be books and computers. 
For many, the meeting was an emotional reunion. Some parents and children were seeing each other for the first time since the fire. 
Staff members there included Jessica Hamack, the school's office manager, who was applauded by parents for canceling classes when the fire rapidly overtook Paradise. Some credit her cancellation notice for alerting them to the flames.

Hamack said she issued the alert after seeing flames behind the school when she arrived for work, adding: ""There were already kids in my office and that made me nervous.""

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka signed two multi-million dollar contracts with Chinese firms for a port upgrade project on Thursday in the middle of a political hiatus that has raised doubts over the legitimacy of the government and the legality of the deals. 
The debt-saddled island has long been a target of Beijing's ambitious Belt and Road infrastructure scheme to connect China with countries cross Asia and beyond, while regional power India has also been vying for deals to counter China's influence. 
But a political crisis triggered by President Maithripala Sirisena's replacement of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe with Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was in turn sacked by parliament, has raised doubts over who can legitimately make decisions in the country. 
Foreign countries have yet to recognize the new government and Wickremesinghe's party has said any decisions by Rajapaksa's cabinet are illegal.
An official at the state-run Sri Lanka Ports Authority told Reuters it signed two contracts with Chinese firms worth over $50 million on Thursday after the deals were approved by Rajapaksa's disputed cabinet last week.
One of Rajapaksa's cabinet ministers, speaking on condition of anonymity, also confirmed the deals had been approved by the cabinet, while documents seen by Reuters showed the deals were set to be rubber-stamped at the meeting.
The contracts are a $32 million project to enhance the deep berth capacity of state-run Jaya Container Terminal (JCT) in Colombo with China Harbour Engineering Company, and another one worth $25.7 million for the purchase of three cranes from JCT Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries Co. Ltd for the same project., according to the ports authority official.
Asked about the deals, the former cabinet spokesperson under Wickremesinghe's government, Rajitha Senaratne, told Reuters:
""We will have to re-examine definitely. They don't have the legal power to decide."" 
The ports authority official said the tenders for the deals had been advertised in state-owned newspapers, as is the norm in Sri Lanka, and that they were sent to a cabinet-appointment procurement panel months ago. 
India, which accounts for around 80 percent of Colombo's trans-shipment business, has raised concerns over increasing Chinese projects in Colombo. 
New Delhi had been pushing Sri Lanka for the award of an estimated $1 billion contract for a second foreign-operated container terminal in Colombo. 
But that deal was the subject of an argument between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe just before his ouster, in which Sirisena reportedly said the country couldn't give any more of its assets to foreigners. 
The political instability and economic malaise have raised questions over Sri Lanka's ability to service large external debt taken to finance reconstruction following the end the civil war in 2009. It owes around $8 billion to China, including state linked firms and banks, official data shows.

Overall, 35 vessels have been prevented from carrying out normal operations and only vessels moving towards Russian ports on the Azov Sea are permitted entry, he said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
""The goal is simple - by placing a blockade on Ukrainian ports on the Azov Sea, Russia hopes to drive Ukraine out of our own territory - territory that is ours in accordance with all relevant international laws,"" he said.
Omelyan said 18 vessels were awaiting entry into the Azov Sea, including four to Berdyansk and 14 to Mariupol. There is also a line of nine vessels to leave the Azov Sea and eight other vessels are standing by near the port berths.
Grain and steel dominates the Azov ports shipments.
Russia seized three Ukrainian navy ships and their crews on Sunday near the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow annexed in 2014, over what it said was their illegal entry into Russian waters - a charge Ukraine strongly rejects.
The United States and the European Union have both imposed sanctions on Russia over its conduct toward Ukraine since 2014, when Moscow seized Crimea after a pro-Russian leader was toppled in Kiev. 
Moscow later backed pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine in a conflict in which more than 10,000 people have been killed. Major fighting ended with a 2015 ceasefire but deadly exchanges of fire are still frequent.

WARSAW (Reuters) - With a year left until a parliamentary election, Poland's ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party is trying to broaden its appeal to voters outside its core conservative-nationalist constituency, amid signs that its support is waning.
But PiS faces a hard slog winning over liberal urban Poles following years of clashes with the European Union over the rule of law in Poland, the bloc's largest ex-communist member state, and its flirtations with the far-right.
In local elections last month, PiS lost a high-profile race for Warsaw mayor, though it made some limited gains elsewhere.
An opinion poll by Kantar Millward Brown (KMB) last week put support for PiS at about 33 percent, down five percentage points from September and from the 2015 national election. Its popularity has been hit by a corruption scandal that led to the resignation of the PiS-appointed financial regulator. 
""The party is on the defensive - it's unable to solve the problems that it created,"" said Jaroslaw Flis, a political scientist at the Jagiellonian University in Krakow. 
""The crisis (over the financial regulator) and (tensions) over European matters have given a boost to the opposition before next year's elections... These issues could make it hard for PiS... to win over a more centrist electorate.""
PiS, which champions Poland's traditional Catholic values and heritage, remains comfortably ahead of its main centrist and leftist rivals, helped by a buoyant economy, low unemployment, generous welfare handouts and its patriotic rhetoric.
But in a nod to Polish liberals, the government on Nov. 21 reversed changes it had made in the country's Supreme Court that the EU had condemned as undemocratic, allowing judges who had been forced to quit to return to their jobs.
The reform was a centerpiece of the PiS government's years-long legal battle with the EU that has culminated in an unprecedented investigation by the executive European Commission into the rule of law in Poland.
""PiS wants to represent a broad, multi-million-member group of Poles who respect national traditions,"" Zdzislaw Krasnodebski, a senior member of the European Parliament and a PiS ally, told Reuters.
FAR-RIGHT MARCH
But while Polish liberals welcome a less combative approach toward the EU, they have been dismayed by the government's overtures toward the far-right, notably during this month's celebrations to mark the centenary of the modern Polish state.
After Warsaw's mayor tried to ban an annual march by the far-right to mark independence day, the government agreed with organizers after last-minute talks to hold a joint event to mark 100 years since Poland's 1918 declaration of independence.
Participants in the Nov. 11 march chanted anti-EU slogans and waved banners that read ""God, honor, homeland"".
But PiS officials said they had successfully reined in the far-right, noting that the march was largely devoid of the white supremacist and racist slogans that have marred it in previous years.
However some liberals accuse PiS, which says it rejects anti-Semitism and racism, of pandering to the far-right. 
""It's hard to accept such standards of liberal democracy,"" said Rafal Pankowski, a sociologist and deputy editor of Polish anti-fascist magazine, Never Again. ""The government legitimized an extremist group.""
Such concerns - along with the possible fallout from the corruption scandal - could harm PiS and bolster opposition parties in the countdown to European Parliament elections next May and next autumn's parliamentary polls in Poland.

""We will have to seriously think about how to mobilize these (centrist) voters,"" said Adam Bielan, a senior lawmaker from a small center-right party now in coalition with PiS.

CHICO, Calif. (Reuters) - At least 88 people have been killed and 196 people are listed as missing three weeks after the deadliest wildfire in California history torched a small mountain community leaving it in smoldering ruins, authorities said on Wednesday.
The Camp Fire, which began on Nov. 8, destroyed nearly 14,000 homes and burned nearly 153,000 acres (62,000 hectares), an area five times the size of San Francisco, in and around the town of Paradise, a northern California community of 27,000 people.

Three people were removed from the list of missing on Wednesday when they were found in an RV park, the sheriff said. 
Some 35 people who were killed in the fire have been identified through DNA and other forensics while another 47 have been tentatively identified. Six remain unidentified, the sheriff said.

375,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2018 01:36AM ET</span>",General behind deadly Haiti raid takes aim at Brazil's gangs,"By Gabriel Stargardter
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Thirteen years ago, a Brazilian general named Augusto Heleno led hundreds of United Nations troops into a Haitian slum to bring a powerful gangster to heel. 
Over the course of a seven-hour gun battle, the peacekeepers sprayed more than 22,000 bullets into the impoverished Port-au-Prince neighborhood of Cite Soleil. Their target, a warlord known as Dread Wilme, was killed.
The operation, dubbed ""Iron Fist,"" was the capstone of Heleno's mission to restore order in Haiti after its president was ousted by insurgents. Heleno declared the raid a success. 
But various human rights groups called it a ""massacre,"" alleging dozens of bystanders were killed in the crossfire, many of them women and children.
The episode, largely forgotten outside Haiti, may provide a road map for the security strategy of Brazil's next president, far-right former army captain Jair Bolsonaro. He has tapped Heleno to be his top national security advisor and wants the former general and other ex-Haiti hands to tame Brazil's favelas using methods employed in the slums of Port-au-Prince.
Brazil suffered a record 64,000 murders last year, the most in the world. Bolsonaro has promised no mercy for lawbreakers.
""We are at war. Haiti was also at war,"" Bolsonaro said in a recent TV interview. ""(In Haiti), the rule was, you found an element with a firearm, you shoot, and then you see what happened. You solve the problem.""
Haiti looms large in Bolsonaro's cabinet. 
His proposed defense minister, former Gen. Fernando Azevedo e Silva, served there under Heleno as an operations chief. Bolsonaro's incoming infrastructure minister, Tarcisio Freitas, was a senior U.N. military engineer in Haiti, arriving shortly after Heleno left in 2005. Retired Gen. Carlos Alberto dos Santos Cruz, Brazil's next government minister, led U.N. troops in the Caribbean nation in 2007. 
Neither Heleno nor Azevedo e Silva responded to requests for comment about the Cite Soleil raid.
It remains to be seen just how heavy-handed Heleno's approach might be in Brazil, particularly in crime-ridden Rio de Janeiro state. But other crackdowns there have not produced lasting results.
Those efforts include a massive security push in some of the city's favelas ahead of the 2016 Olympic Games, and a more recent state-wide military intervention launched in February. In Rio state, violent deaths are up 1.3 percent during the first nine months of the latest occupation compared with the same period last year; the number of people killed by security forces jumped more than 40 percent, with about four people slain daily.
Rio's current intervention is slated to finish just before Bolsonaro takes office on January 1. Neither Heleno nor Azevedo e Silva have ruled out extending it.
In recent weeks, Heleno has expressed support for a radical crime-fighting strategy promoted by Rio state's incoming right-wing governor, Wilson Witzel. That plan would put snipers in helicopters to take out favela gangsters.
Heleno said in a recent radio interview that his rules of engagement in Haiti were similar to those proposed by Witzel, adding that key parts of the Rio military intervention ""can serve as a model for the rest of the country.""
Those views alarm some members of the armed forces, who fear protracted urban warfare could sap troop morale and stoke public resentment against one of Brazil's most respected institutions.
And some public safety experts worry Brazil's new leaders will double down on a failed strategy.
""Rio is a laboratory which illustrates that these types of policies do not work,"" said Ignacio Cano, a Rio de Janeiro State University professor who has written extensively on security issues.
'BULLETS FLEW THROUGH THE WALLS'
Reuters interviewed more than a dozen people with knowledge of the July 6, 2005 raid, including diplomats, NGO workers, Haitian officials and Cite Soleil residents. Reuters also reviewed U.N. reports, U.S. diplomatic cables released by Wikileaks, press articles and Heleno's own words from the time. Together, they paint a detailed picture of the pressures weighing on Heleno to get tough in Haiti. 
Brazil assumed military control of the U.N.'s mission to stabilize Haiti, known as MINUSTAH, in mid-2004. Heleno, Brazil's first MINUSTAH military commander, arrived shortly after the ouster and exile of then-President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The general was tasked with stabilizing the country to allow for peaceful elections.
Standing in his way were powerful criminal gangs operating violent kidnapping, carjacking and extortion rackets. As months passed, the United States, in particular, expressed impatience with Heleno's progress.
""MINUSTAH has failed to establish security and stability here,"" James B. Foley, then-U.S. ambassador to Haiti, wrote in a June 1, 2005 cable to Washington. ""As much as we may pressure the UN and Brazilians to take the more forceful approach that is needed, I do not believe ultimately they will be up to the task.""
Five weeks later, Heleno ordered 440 U.N. troops, supported by 41 armored vehicles and helicopters, into Cite Soleil to detain Wilme, whom U.S. cables described as Haiti's most powerful gangster.
Heleno's team initially said Wilme and a few henchman had died, resulting in five or six fatalities tops, according to press accounts. But reports of civilian injuries and deaths quickly surfaced.
""We have credible information that U.N. troops, accompanied by Haitian police, killed an undetermined number of unarmed residents of Cite Soleil, including several babies and women,"" Renan Hedouville, the head of a local nonprofit, Lawyers Committee for the Respect of Individual Rights, said at the time.
The then-head of Medecins Sans Frontiers' mission in Haiti told reporters that its doctors treated 27 people with gunshot wounds, most of them women and children.
U.S. diplomats also cast doubt on MINUSTAH's version of events. A July 26, 2005 cable said ""22,000 rounds is a large amount of ammunition to have killed only six people,"" and noted some local human rights groups had put the estimated death toll as high as 70.
A spokesman for Haiti's current government did not respond to a request for comment about the raid or the Brazilian leadership of MINUSTAH troops.
But some Cite Soleil residents cannot shake the memory of that day. Street vendor Anol Pierre said she was at home when the firefight began.
""I hid under the bed with my children as the bullets flew through the walls,"" she said. ""We just prayed to Jesus. I remember a pregnant woman, with two kids, who died. Lots of families were victims."" 
NO REGRETS
Juan Gabriel Valdes, MINUSTAH's civilian chief in Haiti at the time, said Heleno's soldiers were permitted by U.N peacekeeping rules to return fire after they came under attack. MINUSTAH said Cite Soleil remained so volatile that it was impossible to conduct a full investigation to ascertain the death toll.
Responding to allegations of excessive force, a U.N. Special Rapporteur asked MINUSTAH for clarification on what happened. The Rapporteur's report found MINUSTAH's explanation for its actions ""largely satisfactory.""
Heleno expressed disdain for those who questioned his actions, according to Seth Donnelly, a human rights worker in Haiti at the time. In a written report about the assault, Donnelly said Heleno told him and his fellow activists that they ""only seemed to care about the rights of the 'outlaws.'"" 
Heleno's views on public security have not softened since leaving Haiti. In 2008, while still in uniform, he publicly criticized Brazilian policies granting indigenous tribes autonomy over ancestral lands as a threat to national sovereignty. 
When he retired in 2011, Heleno defended Brazil's 1964-1985 military dictatorship as a bulwark against ""the communization of the country."" 
In a radio interview earlier this month, Heleno said human rights should be reserved for ""righteous humans."" He said criminal gangs are transforming Brazil into a ""narco country"" and that aggressive measures must be employed to stop them. 

""It is absurd to treat this as a normal situation,"" he said. ""It is an exceptional situation that requires exceptional treatment.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's government proposed on Thursday allowing its foreign spies to use lethal force against anyone who could jeopardize an intelligence operation, giving the spy agency more autonomy on overseas missions. 
Australian law currently allows agents posted abroad to use lethal force in self-defense, to protect the lives of other agents or to safeguard those working with the Canberra government. 
""The changes will mean officers are able to protect a broader range of people and use reasonable force if someone poses a risk to an operation,"" Foreign Minister Marise Payne said in a statement.
For example, the amended law would allow Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) agents to use lethal force to protect individuals, such as hostages, during overseas missions, she said. ASIS is Canberra's overseas spy agency.
The amendment introduced in parliament on Thursday was necessary because of the increased dangers faced by ASIS agents, Payne said.
""Our ASIS officers often work in dangerous locations, including under warlike conditions, to protect Australia and our interests,"" she said.
Australia, a staunch U.S. ally that sent troops to Afghanistan and Iraq, has been on heightened alert for attacks by militants both at home and at its foreign embassies. 
A government source said Australian agents operating under the new law would have similar powers to those available to intelligence officers working for other Western spy agencies.
The amendment requires the support of Australia's parliament, where the government does not have a majority.
A spokeswoman for the opposition Labor party did not respond immediately to a request for comment on Thursday, although the party has broadly supported similar security reforms previously.
A parliamentary committee and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security would retain their oversight of ASIS' rules around use of weapons and force, Payne said. 
Warren Reed, a former ASIS officer who is now a writer and commentator, said such oversight was critical.

""While I support it ... it throws up the age-old question about who guards the guardians,"" Reed told Reuters.

GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - When medics tried to reach Ebola patients in a village in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo during a recent surge in violence, they were blocked by men wielding machetes and axes. 
Worried about being kidnapped, they turned back, the latest in a series of setbacks in their attempts to contain the central African country's worst outbreak of the deadly virus.
As fighting has worsened between rival militia seeking control of land and natural resources, vaccinations and vital treatments have increasingly been delayed and Ebola has spread.
The situation has become so dangerous in eastern Congo that humanitarian workers were temporarily evacuated last month from their base in the town of Beni in the North Kivu region close to Rwanda and Uganda. 
With the vast country of more than 80 million people also suffering from political instability and facing a refugee crisis, World Health Organization experts see it as one of the most complex public health challenges in recent history.
""Sometimes in the field we hear bullets flying left to right and we tell ourselves maybe it is going to hit one of us,"" said Mimi Kambere, emergency response coordinator for nonprofit group Oxfam, whose team was confronted by the men with machetes.
""Sometimes the insecurity pushes us not to respond to calls, and not to go into certain areas for days,"" she told Reuters in Goma, the town on the northern shores of Lake Kivu to which she and other health workers were evacuated on Nov. 17.
Congo's tenth outbreak since Ebola was discovered in 1976 has infected 422 people and killed 241 in the last four months. It will become the second largest outbreak of the disease if it surpasses the 425 cases recorded in Uganda in 2000, according to Congo health ministry records.
The disease is spread through contact with bodily fluids and causes hemorrhagic fever with severe vomiting, diarrhea and bleeding. In many flare-ups, more than half of cases are fatal. In the worst outbreak, which began in 2013, more than 11,000 people were killed in three years, mostly in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.
Tracking contacts of patients and immunizing them with a preventative vaccine swiftly contained an Ebola outbreak in a peaceful area of western Congo this year. This raised hopes that new ways of fighting Ebola could reduce its deadliness, even in urban areas.
But in what a World Health Organization official in Geneva called ""a potential perfect storm"", densely populated North Kivu is now at the epicenter of both the fighting and Ebola. 
A WHO emergency committee said in October that the outbreak was likely to worsen significantly unless the response was stepped up. In November, the number of new cases rose, and the virus spread into previously untouched areas.
An internal note by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNHCR), which was seen by Reuters, recorded 28 violent incidents affecting Ebola response teams between August and November. 
GRAPHIC: https://tmsnrt.rs/2ReWwZU
DEATH THREATS 
International and Congolese health workers are not only hampered by gunfire. They often face what the WHO calls ""reluctance, refusal and resistance"" by some Congolese to accept treatment.
Some Congolese believe medics come to spread the disease with their vaccination needles. Others do not believe the virus exists at all. A number of medics, especially local staff, have received verbal death threats and have had rocks thrown at their cars, they told Reuters.
Such actions, the WHO says, are driven by fear of Ebola and are being exploited by local politicians before a presidential election due in December.
Those that do seek medical help often find themselves in unsanitary medical facilities where the virus spreads, medics said. 
Humanitarian workers' scope for action is also limited by the shortening of the working day under curfews imposed by the government, Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and the U.N. because of the fighting. 
This delays crucial services such as blood tests and safe burials of Ebola victims to help prevent the virus spreading.
""Armed groups that attack Beni pose an enormous obstacle for our staff,"" said Michel Yao, the WHO's incident manager in Beni. 
In some areas, the WHO must seek permission from armed groups to access new patients. Negotiations via phone to secure safe passage can delay vital early care, Yao said, and interrupt vaccination plans. 
""We never had to negotiate access to patients before. It's a specificity of this Ebola outbreak,"" Yao said. 
WHO staff, along with representatives of the World Food Programme and aid agency UNICEF, were among dozens of people evacuated for psychological evaluation after fighting in Beni two weeks ago in which 12 Congolese soldiers and seven U.N. peacekeepers were killed, the WHO said.
Gunfire came close to the town's Ebola Emergency Center and a hotel housing humanitarian workers. A shell landed on a building where WHO staff were staying but did not explode.
""It was scary because normally violence is not that close,"" said a UNICEF employee who asked not to be named. 
To avoid stray bullets, he followed advice he was given in training.
""I entered my room and crouched in the shower. I was stuck in the shower for three hours,"" he said.
FAST WORK IS VITAL
Effectively containing Ebola involves fast work under pressure: health workers must check all possible new cases, take blood samples, isolate the sick and track everyone a patient has been in contact with. 
A slow international response contributed to the rapid spread of Ebola in West Africa in 2013, the outbreak that developed into the worst so far. 
In Congo, visiting potential patients often means driving for many hours along pitted country roads, health workers said. In eastern Congo that can mean danger.
A laboratory in Beni receives between 50 and 70 blood samples each day from health workers in the field, but testing those samples has slowed because of the time restrictions imposed by the curfews, said Congo health ministry spokeswoman Jessica Llunga. 
""Until we have confirmation that the patient has Ebola, we cannot transfer him to a center and we cannot vaccinate his contacts, which also hampers the fight against the epidemic,"" she said.

MANILA (Reuters) - A Philippine court on Thursday sentenced three police officers to up to 49 years in jail for the murder of a 17-year-old high school student, the first to be convicted in President Rodrigo Duterte's drugs war.
The Caloocan City regional trial court declared the three police guilty for the killing of Kian Lloyd delos Santos in August 2017 in a dark, trash-filled alley in a northern suburb in the capital Manila. 
""A shoot first, think later attitude can never be countenanced in a civilized society. Never has homicide or murder been a function of law enforcement. The public peace is never predicated on the cost of human life"", said the ruling by Judge Roldolfo Azucena. 
This was the first case of what human rights advocates say was an extrajudicial killing carried out by state-agents in the 29-month war on drugs, which saw close to 5,000 people dead in police anti-drugs operations.
Police reject allegations that the killings were executions, saying the drug peddlers and users were killed in shootouts, and that they were acting in self-defense.
The death of the school boy has stirred unprecedented public attention on what activists say are executions and systematic abuses by police backed steadfastly by Duterte. (https://reut.rs/2jozqDx)
Duterte, a firebrand leader who unleashed a ferocious war against illegal drugs after coming into office in June 2016, has more than once said he would not allow the police to go to jail for killing drug users and pushers. 
But shortly after the verdict was handed down, Duterte's spokesperson, Salvador Panelo said: ""This is murder, there is intention to kill. The president would never tolerate that"". 
Duterte's government has repeatedly said there was no declared policy to kill drug users and pushers. 
""The conviction of the three police officers for murdering Kian de los Santos is a victory for justice but it is not enough. The killings must stop,"" said Jose Manuel Diokno, chairman of the Free Legal Assistance Group (FLAG).
FLAG has questioned the legality of the drugs war before the Philippine Supreme Court. 
Delos Santos was found dead in an alley with a gun in his left hand. Police said they killed him in self defense, but his family dismissed that as a lie.
Security cameras showed the officers aggressively escorting a man matching delos Santos' description in the direction of the spot where he was killed.
""Justice was served for my son,"" Kian's mother, Lorenza delos Santos told reporters outside the courtroom. ""We were able to prove that my son was innocent of all the accusations hurled against him.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's top court ruled on Thursday that Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd (T:7011) must compensate 28 South Koreans for their forced labour during World War Two, a ruling that drew an immediate rebuke from Tokyo. 
The decision echoed the Supreme Court's landmark verdict last month that ruled in favour of South Koreans seeking compensation from Japan's Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp. (T:5401) for their wartime forced labour. 
It upheld a 2013 appeals court decision that Mitsubishi must pay 80 million won ($71,000) to each of 23 plaintiffs in compensation.
In a separate ruling, the court also ordered Mitsubishi to pay up to 150 million won to each of another five plaintiffs or their families.
Mitsubishi called the verdict ""deeply regrettable"", saying in a statement that it would discuss its response with the Japanese government. 
Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono quickly issued a statement in which he said the court's decisions were ""totally unacceptable"".
""This fundamentally overturns the legal basis for friendly ties between Japan and South Korea and is extremely regrettable,"" Kono said.
Kono urged Seoul to take steps to ensure ""fair economic activity"" for Japanese firms or Tokyo would consider its options, including referring the case to an international court.
A senior official at Seoul's foreign ministry said the government respected the ruling and would craft measures in a way that could heal the victims' wounds but at the same time foster future relations with Japan. 
Previous cases the group of five former labourers had brought in Japan were dismissed on the grounds that their right to reparation was terminated by a 1965 treaty normalising diplomatic ties between Seoul and Tokyo.
However, the South Korean Supreme Court upheld last month's ruling that Japan's occupation of the peninsula was illegal. 
""The treaty does not cover the right of the victims of forced labour to compensation for crimes against humanity committed by a Japanese company in direct connection with the Japanese government's illegal colonial rule and war of aggression against the Korean peninsula,"" the court said in a statement.
Kim Seong-ju, a 90-year-old plaintiff in the second case, said she was sent to Japan when she was 15 with the recommendation of her teacher, who was a Japanese national. 
""I was told that I could go to middle and high school and study more, but it turned out I had to work at the factory all the time,"" Kim told a news conference after the ruling, showing her permanently injured hand. ""Now I feel great.""
Japan and South Korea share a bitter history that includes Japan's 1910-45 colonisation of the Korean peninsula and the use of comfort women, Japan's euphemism for girls and women, many of them Korean, forced to work in its wartime brothels. 

The rows over wartime history have long been a stumbling block for relations between the East Asian neighbours, sparking concern that their joint efforts to rein in North Korea's nuclear programme could be affected.

(Reuters) - Women earned roughly half the income of men in the United States over a 15-year period, taking into account time off for family or child care, according to a report released on Wednesday, which found the pay gap is far greater than has commonly been assumed.
In an examination of women's income from 2001 to 2015, the Washington-based Institute for Women's Policy Research found that women's income was 51 percent less than men's earnings, which includes time with no income.
""Much ink has been spilled debating whether the commonly cited measure of the wage gap - that women earn 80 cents for every dollar earned by a man - is an exaggeration due to occupational differences or so-called 'women's choices',"" Heidi Hartmann, president of the institute and a co-author of the study, said in a statement.
""But our analysis finds that we have actually been underestimating the extent of pay inequality in the labor market,"" Hartmann said.
The study, ""Still a Man's Labor Market,"" showed that the wage gap has narrowed since 1968, with women's inflation-adjusted income rising to an average of $29,000 for the period from 2001 to 2015, compared with $14,000 from 1968 to 1982.
But women are nearly twice as likely as men to take at least one year off work, and they pay a high price for it. Women who left the workforce for a year earned, during their years on the job, an average of 39 percent less than men, the study found.
Companies are likely to pay their employees less, regardless of gender, if they leave their jobs at some point. But women are more often hurt by that pay cut, the study found, because they are more likely to take time off. 
With paid family and medical leave and affordable child care, women are more likely to stay in the workforce and earn higher pay, according to the study.

(This story corrects to show women's income was 51 percent less than men, not 49 percent, in paragraph 2)

Cabello is the most senior person in President Nicolas Maduro's government to comment on Alejandro Andrade's admission to U.S. prosecutors in documents unsealed last week that he conspired to launder money while running the treasury for four years under late President Hugo Chavez.
A Florida judge on Tuesday sentenced Andrade to 10 years, the maximum prison term he faced. He admitted receiving properties, Mercedez Benz vehicles and ""champion horses"" as part of illicit foreign currency schemes that involved a local television mogul now indicted in U.S. courts.
""It hurts us personally, of course,"" Cabello, who also presides over the all-powerful constituent assembly, said in his weekly television program, accusing Andrade of ""betraying"" Chavez. ""But I repeat: to be a Chavista, one must fight against corruption, not be corrupt."" 
Maduro, Chavez's hand-picked successor, proudly refers to himself as a ""son"" of Chavez and has maintained his left-wing economic policies.
Andrade, who lives in Florida, must surrender to U.S. prison by Feb. 25, the court ruled. Venezuela's chief prosecutor Tarek Saab last week requested his extradition from the United States.
U.S. federal prosecutors are seeking to crack down on the use of the U.S. financial system to launder proceeds from rampant corruption in the crisis-stricken South American country that is suffering from hyperinflation and a fifth year of economic contraction.

Since 2003, the exchange control system has sold heavily subsidized dollars through state currency agencies or government auctions. But dollars on the black market have fetched at least double and sometimes 10 times more, allowing the well-connected to buy cut-rate dollars and resell them at a huge profit.

Russia seized three Ukrainian navy ships and their crews on Sunday near the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow annexed in 2014, over what it said was their illegal entry into Russian waters - a charge Ukraine strongly refutes.
In interviews with Germany's Bild newspaper and the Funke newspaper group on Thursday, Poroshenko rejected Russia's charge that the vessels' entry into the Azov Sea - a body of water shared by Ukraine and Russia on which the Ukrainian ports of Mariupol and Berdyansk sit - was a provocation.
""Don't believe Putin's lies,"" he told Bild, Germany's biggest-selling paper, comparing Russia's protestations of innocence in the affair to Moscow's 2014 denial that it had soldiers in Crimea even as they moved to annex it.
""Putin wants the old Russian empire back,"" he said. ""Crimea, Donbass, the whole country. As Russian Tsar, as he sees himself, his empire can't function without Ukraine. He sees us as his colony.""
The seizure of the navy vessels drove tensions to their highest since 2015, when Moscow-backed rebels rose against the Kiev government in the eastern Donbass region, sparking a war that has killed tens of thousands.
Poroshenko called on Germany, the largest and wealthiest buyer of Moscow's gas exports, to halt the building of an undersea gas pipeline that would allow Russia to supply Germany directly, cutting out Ukraine.
""We need a strong, resolute and clear reaction to Russia's aggressive behavior,"" he told Funke. ""That also means stopping the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project.""
Germany regards the pipeline, which is being built by Russian state-owned energy company Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), as a private investment. But Merkel recently acknowledged its ""political dimensions"" and said Ukraine must continue to be a conduit for Russian gas sold to western Europe.
German officials said on Wednesday that their position on the pipeline remained unchanged and that talk of tighter sanctions against Moscow, demanded by the United States and many European politicians, was ""premature"".

Poroshenko also called for the stationing of NATO vessels in the Sea of Azov.

384,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 08:10PM ET</span>",No swift new EU sanctions on Russia seen after Ukraine sea incident,"By Gabriela Baczynska
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's hawks have called for more sanctions on Russia after a fresh flare-up of tensions with Ukraine but the divided bloc is not going to act swiftly, if at all, diplomatic sources said.
In a sign of their long-standing divisions on how to handle President Vladimir Putin's Russia, the 28 EU states have taken three days to agree a joint statement after Russia seized Ukrainian navy vessels and sailors on Sunday.
In the end the bloc issued a statement by its top diplomat Federica Mogherini on Wednesday night expressing ""utmost concern about the dangerous increase of tensions"" and dismay at the ""unacceptable"" use of force by Russia.
The three former Soviet republics sitting on the Baltic Sea coast, backed by Poland and Britain, wanted much tougher language on more sanctions looming.
Several senior European politicians raised the prospect on Tuesday and U.S. President Donald Trump said he might cancel a meeting with Putin later this week over the maritime clash he described as ""aggression"".
But the bloc's top powers Germany and France have so far emphasized efforts to ease tensions. The statement by Mogherini did not mention sanctions but only says regarding the situation that the bloc will ""continue to follow closely"" and ""act appropriately.""
Countries including Italy, Greece, Bulgaria and Cyprus have long called for a softer stance vis-à-vis Moscow, saying the bloc's existing economic sanctions over Russia's role in the turmoil in Ukraine hurt EU businesses too. 
""We are not going to move very quickly on any new sanctions, there could be some later on, that is not ruled out. But for now the unity of the 28 is key. And focus on de-escalation,"" one EU diplomat said. 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke to Putin and Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko on Tuesday. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was in France. 
""There is a lot of contacts going on. Let's see where they take us. I doubt we will rush on sanctions too much,"" another EU diplomat also said. 
The bloc first imposed sanctions after Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Kiev in 2014. Brussels tightened the measures as Moscow went on to back rebels fighting against government troops in east Ukraine.
EU leaders are expected to decide to roll the economic sanctions over for another year when they meet in Brussels in December. They could also look at any new punitive measures then after a discussion among their foreign ministers on Dec.10.
""In order to discuss sanctions, we'd need to have a clearer picture of what happened,"" another EU source said, highlighting unease in some EU quarters that Poroshenko could also stand to gain from the situation. 
Putin on Wednesday accused Poroshenko of orchestrating a ""provocation"" in the sea to boost his flagging popularity ratings before an election next year.
Following the incident, Ukraine introduced martial law in parts of the country it says are vulnerable to Russian attack. The European Commission has said it received ""important"" assurances from Poroshenko that this would not interfere with democratic processes or restrict citizens rights. 
SANCTIONS SQUIRTING
The EU statement called on Russia to free the Ukrainian vessels and sailors as well as ensure unrestricted sea access. It would urge both sides to show restraint and express support for Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty, diplomatic sources said.
EU diplomats said the latest escalation weakens the hand of Russia doves in the bloc. While the EU was unlikely to introduce new economic sanctions, it could add more names to its existing blacklists, including some Russian military personnel, the sources said.
Despite the fact that imposing any sanctions requires the unanimity of all 28 EU states, the bloc has at times had problems enforcing them, as prominently showcased when gas turbines made by Germany's Siemens were delivered to Crimea.
Enforcing and policing EU sanctions is a matter for every state separately but they sometimes fail to act, lacking the political will or bowing to pressure from their businesses.
The U.S. State Department called on the EU on Tuesday to do more to help Ukraine in its struggle with Russia, including through tougher enforcement of existing sanctions and dropping support for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline with Moscow.
Washington, which under Trump has promoted more exports of its own natural gas that competes with Russia, has long lobbied the EU against the construction of another pipeline that would deepen the bloc's dependence on Russian gas deliveries.

The U.S. government has threatened to sanction those involved in the project but Germany - the final destination of the pipeline and the project's co-author with Russia - said it was sticking to it.

CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - A South African advocacy group that lobbies for the rights of white farmers will on Thursday challenge in court President Cyril Ramaphosa's plan to change the constitution to allow land expropriation without compensation.
Ramaphosa, who replaced scandal-plagued Jacob Zuma in February, has made land redistribution a flagship policy as he seeks to unite the fractured ruling African National Congress (ANC) and win public support ahead of an election next year.
Land is a hot-button issue in South Africa, where racial inequality runs deep even 24 years after the end of apartheid. Whites - nine percent of the 56 million population - still own more than 70 percent of agricultural land.
Since white minority rule ended in 1994, the ANC has followed a ""willing-seller, willing-buyer"" model whereby the government buys white-owned farms for redistribution to blacks. Progress has been slow.
Afriforum, an advocacy group that mostly represents white Afrikaners, is questioning the legality of a key parliamentary committee report that recommended a change to the constitution, according to court papers seen by Reuters. 
Afriforum says the committee illegally appointed an external service-provider to compile the report and also failed to consider more than 100,000 submissions opposing land expropriation without compensation.
""We want the court to refer the report back to the committee and to request the committee to repair the wrongs,"" Willie Spies, Afriforum's attorney, told Reuters.
Parliament, where the ANC enjoys an overwhelming majority, filed an answering affidavit arguing that Afriforum was trying to frustrate the legislative process.
Parliament says the report was produced by its staff and that it had considered all submissions. 
""Afriforum’s litigation is, in any event, improper. The Report is clearly an interim step with no final effect,"" parliament said in court papers.
The committee's report is just one step in a long process to change the constitution. Should the court rule the report does not need to be sent back for further consideration, it is expected the National Assembly will move to adopt its recommendations early in December.
Thereafter, it is expected a new bill proposing the exact changes envisaged to the constitution will go to parliament and further public participation.
Only once both houses of parliament approve changes to the constitution will it be sent to Ramaphosa for ratification. This process is unlikely to be completed before a parliamentary election expected to be held in May.

Ramaphosa has given few details about how a constitutional change would be implemented but says any reforms will not affect investment, economic growth or food supply.

The voyage risks further heightening tensions with China but will likely be viewed in self-ruled Taiwan as a sign of support from U.S. President Donald Trump's government amid growing friction between Taipei and Beijing.
""The ships' transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the U.S. commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific,"" U.S. Pacific Fleet said in a statement. ""The U.S. Navy will continue to fly, sail and operate anywhere international law allows.""
It said the passage was carried out by Stockdale destroyer and Pecos, a replenishment vessel.
Taiwan's Defense Ministry said it was a normal transit through international waters in the Taiwan Strait and that Taiwanese forces had monitored the passage of the ships.
There was no immediate reaction from China. 
The latest move comes ahead of an expected meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping this week in Argentina on the sidelines of a G20 summit. 
The U.S. Navy conducted a similar mission in the strait's international waters in July, which had been the first such voyage in about a year. 
The latest operation shows the U.S. Navy is increasing the pace of strait passages.
Washington has no formal ties with Taiwan, but is bound by law to help it defend itself and is the island's main source of arms. The Pentagon says Washington has sold Taiwan more than $15 billion in weaponry since 2010.
China has been ramping up pressure to assert its sovereignty over the island, which it considers a breakaway province of ""one China.""
Over the weekend, Taiwan's ruling pro-independence Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party suffered heavy losses in mayoral and county elections to the China-friendly Kuomintang, which has been welcomed by Beijing.
Taiwan is only one of a growing number of flashpoints in the U.S.-China relationship, which also include a trade war, U.S. sanctions and China's increasingly muscular military posture in the South China Sea.

Britain and the EU have pledged to co-operate on security issues through institutions such as Europol and Eurojust after Brexit, although a proposed ""operational cooperation"" between police and justice systems is vague.
But a no-deal Brexit would be a step back for security co-operation compared to Prime Minister Theresa May's proposed accord, Wallace will say.
""A no-deal situation would have a real impact on our ability to work with our European partners to protect the public,"" Wallace will tell the International Security Expo in London, according to pre-released extracts of the speech.
""This (May's) deal strikes the right balance to keep everyone safe. It will be an ambitious partnership that ensures we can continue to work with our European partners in tackling our shared threats."" 
Britain, along with France, is one of Europe's biggest military powers and hoped that security would be one of its bargaining chips as it seeks a new relationship with the EU, calling for a defense and security treaty in 2019.
Wallace will say that the framework for the future partnership, which is not legally binding, will see Britain and the EU co-operate on areas like cyber-security, DNA exchange and extradition.
However, Britain failed to win a guarantee of access to EU security databases once it leaves the European Union in the draft deal on future ties, leaving such co-operation open to negotiation.

Emily's parents spent years in Venezuela trying to get a mass removed from her right eyelid, but shortages of food and medicine forced them to migrate across the border to Colombia to seek treatment, as their nation's healthcare system collapsed.
U.S. Navy surgeons completed the procedure in just 30 minutes, suturing the small wound with miniscule stitches aboard the USNS Comfort, a hospital ship making its penultimate stop on a Latin American tour of four countries including Peru, Ecuador and Honduras.
""The operation was so important because it affected her face,"" Emily's mother, Rubileth Parra, 24, said. ""We couldn't get her an operation (in Venezuela), so we came here.""
Emily is one of thousands of patients receiving care during the Comfort's stop near the Caribbean port city of Riohacha.
Medical staff on the ship treated more than 5,400 patients during its previous five-day stop in Turbo, a Colombian city near the border with Panama. An estimated 2,500 will be seen in Riohacha. The trip is the ship's fifth visit to Colombia in the past 11 years.
Although most patients are Colombians seeking care amid long delays in their oversubscribed healthcare system, some are Venezuelan migrants who have fled an economic crisis across the border, where hunger and preventable disease are soaring.
More than 3 million people have left Venezuela in recent years, with about 1 million settling in Colombia. The government has spent millions of dollars in limited public funds to tend to them, including establishing a migrant camp in the capital, Bogota. [nL2N1XV18A]
The United Nations this week approved more than $9 million in aid for Venezuela, its first emergency funding to President Nicolas Maduro's socialist government. Maduro blames Venezuela's problems on U.S. sanctions and an ""economic war"" led by political adversaries. [nL8N1Y15Q8] 
The Navy does not keep exact numbers on the nationalities of patients, who are pre-screened by local authorities, instead focusing on treating anyone who needs care. When Reuters visited on Tuesday, about one in five patients was Venezuelan.
FLOWN BY HELICOPTER 
Most patients receive care on land in two clinics set up in schools in Riohacha. Those getting operations are flown by helicopter to the ship.
Lainer Sivira, 29, was shaken by her first-ever helicopter flight, cradling her 3-year-old son, Enderson, who needs a hernia operation, on her knees. 
""I'm happy because I would never have the money,"" said Sivira, a Venezuelan native whose son was born in Colombia. 
Enderson, boisterous in a striped T-shirt and shorts, was delighted with his high-seas adventure. He smiled broadly when greeted by the interpreter who accompanied the family.
Hernia repairs, along with cataract and dental operations, are the most common procedures because patients generally require minimal follow-up care and the operations can have a huge economic impact, allowing once-incapacitated people to return to work.
""There's a ripple effect,"" said Captain Kevin Buckley, who manages the mission's medical care. ""We're only here for five days, so we want to make sure we can capture people and make an impact in their lives.""
In one operating theater, an elderly man was having a hernia in his groin repaired. 
Three doctors huddled around an incision low on his stomach, sewing a mesh insert into his abdominal wall. 
His general anesthesia began to wear off as his incision was sutured, but an interpreter was there to reassure him the procedure was nearly finished.
Karol Salinas, 26, from Riohacha, was nervous. She was having her impacted upper wisdom teeth extracted via small incisions in her face. 
""I know they'll have to really slice me open, but I need to get them out,"" she said. 

A few minutes later, she was wheeled down to the operating room, flashing a nervous smile as the doors closed behind her.

389,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 06:07PM ET</span>",Ailing Central American migrants in dire conditions dig in at U.S. border,"By Christine Murray
TIJUANA, Mexico (Reuters) - Thousands of Central American migrants are digging in for the long haul at a filthy, overcrowded sports complex in sight of the United States, while a small number have opted to return home after clashes with border forces dimmed hopes of crossing. 
The bedraggled men, women and children of a caravan of mostly Hondurans began cramming into the complex in Tijuana about three weeks ago. They now number more than 6,000 in a space the city government first prepared for a third as many.
As the reality sinks in that those seeking asylum in the United States will likely have to remain in the Mexican border city for months, 350 people have asked authorities to help them travel home.
Jose Luis Tepeu, 22, from Guatemala, was sleeping on cardboard boxes on the ground. He said he would only wait five more days to see if help would come to take him to the United States, or even Canada.
""If they don't come, I'll return to my home,"" he said, saying that salaries in Mexico were too low for him to stay and send money home to help his family. ""You don't earn well here.""
To seek asylum, migrants must first sign onto a waiting list to see U.S. border officials. The list already had a weeks-long backlog before the caravan came. Adding to uncertainty are U.S.-Mexico talks aimed at keeping migrants in Mexico longer.
On Sunday, U.S. border guards fired tear gas canisters at a smaller group, including women and children, that rushed the border.
The violence seems to have shocked some, and dozens more asked to be sent home voluntarily on Monday, said Rodolfo Olimpo, a migration official in Tijuana. 
The overcrowding has also helped illness spread. There have been multiple cases of respiratory illnesses, lice and chicken pox, according to three city officials who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media.
With too many to fit into shelters, the migrants, who had traveled about 3,000 miles (4,800 km) since mid-October, were ushered into the complex to wait until U.S. and Mexican authorities settled on how to deal with them.
Many have been living in tents, while others are in shelters made from trash bags or patches of cold floor walled off with backpacks and blankets, enduring the harsh elements and lack of privacy as they had learned to do on each leg of their near daily 30-mile treks from northern Honduras.
But despite the difficult conditions, many seemed determined to wait in Mexico for their chance to make their case to the United States, with more than 600 applying for permits to work in Mexico just on Tuesday, according to the foreign ministry.
""It cost me a lot to walk almost 15 to 20 hours a day, and to go back now: no,"" said Anabell Pineda, 26, who has pitched a tent in the stadium beside a neat pile of bags and rolled-up blankets.
Pineda, who had traveled for almost a month from the violent Honduran city of San Pedro Sula with her six-year-old son, said she arrived in Tijuana 13 days earlier, feeling unwell.
When she learned it would be nearly impossible to cross to the United States quickly under current U.S. policies, she resolved to be patient, and get a Mexican work permit meanwhile. 
At the complex, men washed using buckets in a shower area beside reeking portable toilets and giant mud puddles. Women, wary of uninvited gazes, bathed with clothes on.
Sniffing through a blocked nose, Katherin Arita, a 17-year-old Honduran, said she has been losing weight since leaving her homeland a month and a half ago. She expected she would have to wait up to four months to try to enter the United States.
""It's dangerous what I'm doing, it's dangerous,"" she said.
Inside a gymnasium where the caravan's first arrivals had set up neat rows of thin mattresses, a city official said there had been a chicken pox outbreak.
U.S. President Donald Trump threatened this week to ""permanently"" close the U.S.-Mexican border if Mexico does not deport the Central Americans gathered in Tijuana.
Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray, who leaves office this weekend, said in response that Central American migrants were welcome to stay in Mexico.

But he said the migrants have a right to request U.S. asylum, and Mexico has repeatedly refused U.S. requests to force them to seek refuge in Mexico instead.

(Reuters) - A group of Jewish Americans sued Airbnb Inc on Wednesday in U.S. federal court, accusing the home rental company of religious discrimination over its decision last week to remove listings for about 200 homes in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
The 18 plaintiffs, including Israeli-American families and individuals who said they own or wish to rent affected homes, accused Airbnb of ""redlining"" Jewish-owned properties while letting Muslims and Christians rent their homes.
They said this effectively left Airbnb taking sides in the dispute over the West Bank, where Palestinians hope to establish an independent state and which Israel captured in 1967, along with East Jerusalem.
""We don't believe this lawsuit will succeed in court, but we know that people will disagree with our decision and appreciate their perspective,"" Airbnb said in a statement.
The complaint was filed in federal court in Delaware, where Airbnb is incorporated, and which the plaintiffs said has jurisdiction over the San Francisco-based company's alleged violation of U.S. laws against housing discrimination.
""Airbnb has made a religion- and nationality-based decision about who can list,"" Robert Tolchin, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an interview. ""It decided in the United States, 'We will not list for Jews in the West Bank.' It should be equal access for all.""
The plaintiffs are seeking injunctive relief and unspecified damages, including for lost rental income.
A separate lawsuit challenging Airbnb's policy was filed in a Jerusalem court on Nov. 22.
The Delaware case differed by claiming that ""Airbnb is violating Americans' rights, and this can't be argued in an Israeli court under Israeli law,"" Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, another lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an interview.
Most world powers believe Israel's settlements on occupied Palestinian land violate international law.
Roughly 500,000 Israelis live in settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
Airbnb's delisting was announced on Nov. 19 and applies only in the West Bank, where Palestinians have limited self-rule under Israeli military occupation.
While concluding that ""companies should not profit on lands where people have been displaced,"" Airbnb said it had ""deep respect"" for the ""many strong views"" about what to do with disputed lands.
Palestinians in the West Bank have welcomed Airbnb's decision.

The case is Silber et al v Airbnb Inc, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware, No. 18-01884.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina will launch a massive security operation in coming days to try to ensure a calm meeting of the leaders of the G20 bloc of nations in Buenos Aires, calling a national bank holiday on Friday and shutting down the city's main business district.
With local merchants riled about losing business on Friday and Saturday, and anti-globalization protesters preparing to march, the government has advised anyone not involved in the G20 to take Friday off and get out of town for a long weekend.
This year's Group of 20 summit, where leaders of the world's 20 top industrialized countries will discuss issues such as trade and climate change, will be held in the Argentine capital from Nov. 30 to Dec. 1. The lockdown of parts of the city will start on Thursday night and last until Sunday.
Protests have been a fixture of past G20 events, and hooded anti-capitalist militants clashed with police in last year's summit in Hamburg, Germany, torching cars, smashing shops and injuring officers. 
Banks, markets and government offices will be closed in Buenos Aires on Friday. 
""Our recommendation is to use the long weekend to get away,"" Security Minister Patricia Bullrich said in a recent television interview.
""Take off after work on Thursday because the city is going to get very challenging. Our security measures will be very strong and the decisions that we will make if there is violence will be immediate,"" she said.
Demonstrators blocked a part of Buenos Aires' main thoroughfare, Avenida 9 de Julio, on Wednesday in protest of subsidy cuts and other austerity measures adopted by President Mauricio Macri.
Security concerns increased after a melee outside a Buenos Aires soccer stadium last weekend that derailed the final leg of the region's main club tournament.
But Bullrich said Buenos Aires is ready for the G20, with 22,000 police and security forces on hand to ensure peace. 
Coffee shop Cafe Metro, a stone's throw from the capital city's Teatro Colon, where G20 leaders will meet for a Friday night gala, will have to close on Friday and Saturday, along with hundreds of other local area businesses.
""We will lose two days of business at the end of the month, and toward the end of the year, when we most need money to pay our bills, the rent and salaries,"" the cafe's manager Fernando Garzon told Reuters.
Others nearby echoed his concerns. 
""It's something that further punishes small businesses at the end of a very punishing year,"" restaurateur Leonardo Suckewer said.
Argentines are struggling with economic recession and inflation at around 45 percent, with the government introducing tough austerity measures as it seeks to lower the fiscal deficit.
Thousands of Argentine left-leaning protesters are expected to march on Friday afternoon. They will be restricted to a 2.5-kilometer (1.55 mile) area that will not include two landmarks they had originally planned to reach: the central Obelisk and Plaza de Mayo, two historic focal point for protests in Argentina, activists said.
""They've made a great effort to make sure there's no one in the streets. We will march anyway,"" said Beverly Keene, march coordinator and head of Jubileo Sur-Dialogo 2000, a group that campaigns for debt reform in Latin America and the Caribbean.

A spokesman for the Security Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - An Argentine judge reviewing a Human Rights Watch complaint against Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman asked the foreign ministry on Wednesday to seek information from Turkey, Yemen and the International Criminal Court.
The office of federal judge Ariel Lijo confirmed the request to Reuters just hours after bin Salman landed in Buenos Aires for the G20 summit of industrialized nations.
Human Rights Watch asked Argentina on Monday to use a war crimes clause in its constitution to investigate any involvement by the crown prince in possible crimes against humanity in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia has launched a military campaign, and the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Saudi Arabia has said the prince, the kingdom's de facto ruler, had no prior knowledge of the murder of Khashoggi in a Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October.
A representative of the federal prosecutor’s office that is working with Judge Lijo on the complaint told Reuters it was still reviewing HRW's request and that no decision had yet been made on whether to investigate it.
The killing of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and a critic of the crown prince, six weeks ago, has strained Saudi Arabia’s ties with the West and battered Prince Mohammed’s image abroad.
Prince Mohammed arrived in Buenos Aires from Tunisia, where he was met by protesters who denounced him as a murderer for the killing of Khashoggi. He was greeted by Argentine foreign minister Jorge Faurie.
Western nations are also calling for an end to the Saudi-led military campaign in neighboring Yemen, which was launched by Prince Mohammed, as a humanitarian crisis there worsens.

The G20 leaders summit begins on Friday.

The government has set out the details of a debate on a motion to approve May's plan to take the country out of the European Union, allowing for amendments to be discussed which could try to reshape the deal she brought back from Brussels.
The format of the debate has been keenly awaited to see whether rivals would have a chance to test their alternative exit plans, such as remaining in the EU's customs union or making exit conditional upon a second referendum.
Any such amendments would not be legally binding on the government, but would prove politically hard to ignore. 
May already has an arduous task to get the motion approved. It is opposed by a large group of lawmakers from her own party, the Northern Irish party that props up her minority government and by all opposition parties who say they will vote against it. 
Defeat would likely unleash huge political uncertainty and could roil financial markets. 
According to documents filed at Britain's parliament on Wednesday, debates will be held on December 4, 5, 6, 10 and 11 with up to six amendments selected on the final day. The opposition Labour party said on Twitter the debate would conclude at 1900 GMT on Dec. 11. 
The amendments could be put to several votes, meaning that as well as overcoming the huge opposition to her plan, May will have to defeat attempts to add extra conditions to it or to thwart the exit agreement altogether.

The government has previously voiced concerns that any of these so-called amendments that win support in the house of commons could prevent the government from ratifying the exit deal because the amended motion would not provide the necessary unequivocal approval required under previously passed legislation.

395,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 03:45PM ET</span>",Explainer: What underlies U.S.-China tensions ahead of crucial G20 meeting?,"By David Brunnstrom and Matt Spetalnick
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to meet on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Argentina this week for what some see as the most important meeting in years between the leaders of the world's two largest economies.
After months of bitter bickering between their governments over trade and security that has raised questions about the very future of a complex but economically pivotal relationship, the two leaders took a step back from the edge with an ice-breaking telephone call early this month.
They expressed optimism about resolving their damaging trade war ahead of the meeting on Saturday, but there have been few tangible signs of progress. They will be in Buenos Aires for the summit of the leaders of the 20 major economies.
Even so, differences among Trump's top advisers over China policy and his personal unpredictability and fondness for headline-grabbing moments mean it remains anyone's guess what the Trump-Xi meeting might bring. 
WHAT CAUSED THE TRADE WAR?
Trump railed against the massive U.S. trade deficit with China during his 2016 election campaign and after a year in office, with no sign of the gap narrowing, the U.S. president attacked the issue head-on. Trump has imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports to force concessions on a list of demands that would fundamentally change the two countries' terms of trade. China has responded with tariffs of its own on U.S. goods, targeting farm states that are an important part of Trump's political base.
Trump has threatened tariffs on another $267 billion worth of Chinese products, including cell phones, computers, clothing and footwear. And 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods are scheduled to rise to a more prohibitive 25 percent on Jan. 1, 2019 unless a truce is agreed. 
Washington wants Beijing to act to reduce a $375 billion trade surplus by opening its economy to foreign competition, increasing protection for U.S. intellectual property, ending joint venture requirements that lead to technology transfers and cutting subsidies to state-owned industries.
It particularly wants to prevent exports to China of advanced technologies in areas such as artificial intelligence and robotics and has tightened rules on foreign investment in 27 sensitive sectors to stop Chinese deals.
The U.S. Justice Department recently charged China state-owned Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co with conspiring to steal trade secrets in what is expected to be the first of several similar cases to attempt to stop the flow of intellectual property into China.
U.S. officials say China has delivered a written response to U.S. demands for wide-ranging trade reforms, but they remain doubtful this will be enough to bring about a breakthrough when Xi and Trump meet.
HOW SERIOUS IS THE U.S.-CHINA SECURITY RIVALRY?
In the past 20 years China has grown rapidly to become arguably Washington's biggest security rival, with defense spending that now far outstrips former Cold War rival Russia. A hundred years after the end of World War One, some academics have even warned of another ""Thucydides Trap"" - a theory that sees a risk of rivalry between a rising and an established power spiraling into open conflict.
Recent years have seen a steady uptick in tensions, punctuated by U.S. naval and air patrols challenging China's extensive claims in the South China Sea and U.S. warship movements through the highly sensitive Taiwan Strait.
While the two sides have taken care to maintain military-to-military contacts, close encounters have raised fears that an accidental clash could escalate into an unexpected conflict - particularly over Taiwan, which Beijing considers a wayward province and a ""red line"" not to be crossed.
Trump added new uncertainty when he said the United States would quit a Cold-War era treaty with Russia that has prevented Washington from stationing ground-based intermediate-range missiles in Asia as well as Europe.
In what was billed as a major policy speech on Oct. 4, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence escalated Washington's trade-driven pressure campaign, highlighting Chinese military and industrial espionage activity and accusing China of ""malign"" efforts to undermine Trump in the Nov. 6 mid-term congressional elections. He offered no concrete evidence of that.
IS THE CURRENT TREND REVERSIBLE?
White House insiders say there remain substantial differences within the Trump administration over how far to push China.
This division groups anti-China hardliner and trade adviser Peter Navarro, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and those who favor a complete reevaluation of the relationship on one side. On the other are pragmatists led by White House chief economist Larry Kudlow and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, concerned about the harm deepening friction could do to the U.S. economy and markets.
In Trump's ""America First"" rhetoric and persistent criticism of the damaging effect he says Chinese trade practices have on America, he has appeared to favor Navarro's school of thought.

But he has also shown himself very aware of the immediately positive effects any indication of an improved mood with Beijing can have on U.S. financial markets and his ratings for handling of the economy at a time when he is under fire on other domestic fronts.

396,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 03:12PM ET</span>",Doomed Lion Air jet was 'not airworthy' on penultimate flight: investigators,"By Cindy Silviana and Fergus Jensen
JAKARTA (Reuters) - A Lion Air jet that crashed into the sea off Indonesia last month was not in a safe condition on its second-to-last flight, when pilots experienced similar problems to those on its doomed last journey, Indonesian investigators said on Wednesday.
A preliminary report unveiled fresh details of efforts by pilots to steady the jet as they reported a ""flight control problem"", including the captain's last words to air traffic control asking to be cleared to ""five thou"" or 5,000 feet.
Indonesia's transport safety committee (KNKT) focused on airline maintenance and training and the response of a Boeing (NYSE:BA) anti-stall system to a recently replaced sensor but did not give a cause for the crash that killed all 189 people on board.
""At this stage I do not have the answer,"" KNKT investigator Nurcahyo Utomo told reporters.
Contact with the Boeing 737 MAX jet was lost 13 minutes after it took off on Oct 29 from the capital, Jakarta, heading north to the tin-mining town of Pangkal Pinang.
The brand-new airplane had suffered a sequence of problems in cockpit readings since Oct 26, culminating in a decision to change a key sensor known as the angle-of-attack probe before the penultimate flight from Denpasar to Jakarta.
During the fatal night-time flight, a ""stick shaker"" was vibrating the captain's controls, warning of a stall throughout most of the 13 minutes aloft based on what investigators believe to have been erroneous data on its angle to the oncoming air.
That angle is a key flight parameter that must remain narrow enough to preserve lift and avoid an aerodynamic stall.
The airplane's anti-stall system repeatedly pushed the nose down, which is how pilots usually get air under the wings. 
But the system experienced an over-reaction known as a runaway, prompting an eight-minute battle between the captain pulling the nose back up and computers holding it down.
Pilots flying the same plane on its penultimate flight a day earlier had experienced a similar problem, en route from Denpasar, Bali to Jakarta. But they used switches to shut off the system and then flew on manual controls, KNKT said.
Although that flight landed safely, the continued shaking of the control column meant the plane was considered ""un-airworthy"" and the flight should have been discontinued, the report said.
Lion Air CEO Edward Sirait rejected reports that the Boeing 737 MAX had not been airworthy since its previous flight, telling reporters it had been cleared by engineers.
""I think pilots can judge for themselves whether to continue,"" Lion Air Managing Director Daniel Putut, a former pilot, added.
BOEING SHARES HIGHER
The report set out a sequence of glitches and incomplete debriefings as well as a mix-up over paperwork over the number of cabin crew on board when Flight JT610 plunged into the sea.
Utomo said the agency had not determined if a new version of the anti-stall system, which was not explained to pilots in manuals, was a contributing factor. 
""We still don't know yet if it contributed or not,"" he said when asked about the new software patch on the Boeing 737 MAX. ""It is too early to conclude.""
Shares in Boeing, which had come under pressure when word of the undocumented new system first emerged, rose 4.5 percent.
""While the flight control problem appears important, crews have been reminded how to address it, and the fix may well be a software change,"" said Bernstein analyst Douglas Harned.
""There appears no reason to expect a MAX fleet grounding, impact to demand, or other significant program implications.""
The world's largest planemaker has 4,542 of the upgraded 737 jets on order from airlines, worth over half a trillion dollars at list prices, or about half that after typical discounts.
In a statement, Boeing threw the focus on a list of airline maintenance actions set out in the report but stopped short of blaming ground workers or pilots for the accident.
It did not make any reference to the revised anti-stall system introduced on the 737 MAX, which investigators and U.S. pilots say was missing from the operating manual.
Boeing says the procedure for dealing with a so-called runaway remains unchanged from previous 737 models.
Pilots however say the control column behaves differently in certain conditions, which could confuse pilots who have flown the earlier model.
Indonesia's director general of aviation, Polana Pramesti, told Reuters the agency planned to require pilots in Indonesia to be trained on simulators for the MAX series rather than the solely computer-based conversion course for 737 pilots.
Wednesday's report provided new recommendations to Lion Air on safety on top of earlier recommendations about the flight manual that have already been implemented by Boeing.
Authorities are meanwhile still looking for the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) believed to be lying among oil pipelines.
Indonesia plans to deploy a ship from Singapore capable of staying in position without dropping anchor in the risky zone.
Asked what was needed from the CVR, Utomo said: ""A lot. Discussions between the left and right pilots were about what? What procedures did they carry out. Were there any strange noises?""

Without it, he added, there would be ""a lot of guessing"".

397,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 03:06PM ET</span>",Putin defiant on Ukraine crisis despite Trump summit talks threat,"By Andrew Osborn and Anton Zverev
MOSCOW/KERCH, Crimea (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday shrugged off a threat from U.S. President Donald Trump to cancel a meeting with him due to Moscow's seizure of three Ukrainian navy ships, and accused Ukraine's president of orchestrating the crisis.
Russia seized the Ukrainian vessels and their crews on Sunday near Crimea, the Ukrainian region which Moscow annexed in 2014, over what it said was their illegal entry into Russian waters, which Ukraine denies. 
The episode has raised fears in the West of a wider conflict between the two countries, and Trump said on Tuesday that he might cancel a planned meeting with Putin at the G20 summit in Argentina later this week as a response to ""aggression"".
Some of Ukraine's Western allies have also raised the possibility of imposing new sanctions on Russia over the episode, which could deliver a blow to the Russian economy.
But Putin, in his first public comments on the Black Sea incident, said that the Ukrainian vessels had clearly been in the wrong, dismissed the clash as a minor border issue, and accused Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko of having orchestrated the crisis in order to boost his dire ratings.
Putin said he also still hoped to meet Trump at the G20, while the Kremlin said the meeting was still being prepared and Washington had not informed Moscow it was off.
""It was without doubt a provocation,"" Putin told a financial forum in Moscow of the incident. ""It was organized by the president ahead of the elections. The president is in fifth place ratings-wise and therefore had to do something. It was used as a pretext to introduce martial law.""
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he was saddened by what he asserted was Washington's willingness to encourage Ukraine's ""provocation"".
Putin said the West was willing to forgive Ukrainian politicians because it bought into their anti-Russian narrative.
Trump has been briefed on the situation as he considers whether to cancel the Putin meeting but no decision has been made, White House officials said on Wednesday.
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Russia's action shows it cannot be counted on to keep its word.
""It was obviously a flagrant violation of international law. It was, I think, a cavalier use of a force that injured Ukrainian sailors,"" he told reporters at the Pentagon.
Kiev has introduced martial law in parts of the country, saying it fears a possible Russian invasion.
Speaking in northern Ukraine, Poroshenko, who has accused Moscow of naked military aggression, talked up his country's readiness to respond to any future Russian military action. 
""It's important to keep our powder dry and be ready at any moment to push back the aggressor,"" said Poroshenko, adding that he had received offers from hundreds of Ukrainian war veterans who said they were ready to return and defend the country.
MISSILES FOR CRIMEA
The United States and the EU have both imposed sanctions on Russia over its conduct toward Ukraine since 2014, when Moscow seized and annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula after a pro-Russian leader was toppled in Kiev. 
Moscow later backed pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine in a conflict in which more than 10,000 people have been killed. Major fighting ended with a 2015 ceasefire but deadly exchanges of fire are still frequent.
A Kremlin aide said on Wednesday that Putin had rebuffed an initiative from Poroshenko for the two men to speak by phone.
Vadim Astafyev, a spokesman for Russia's southern military district, was cited by Russian news agencies as saying that a new battalion of advanced S-400 surface-to-air missiles would be delivered to Crimea soon and become operational by year's end.
The deployment is likely to have been long-planned, but the timing of the announcement appeared designed to send a message to Ukraine and the West that Russia is serious about defending what it regards as its own territory and waters. 
Crimea already hosts three battalions of the anti-aircraft missile systems which have a range of up to 400 km (250 miles) allowing Russia to control large swaths of the skies above the Black Sea. The new missile deployment to Crimea would allow Russia to increase its air defense coverage area.
Separately, a Reuters correspondent in Crimea on Wednesday observed a Russian navy minesweeper ship, the Vice-Admiral Zakharin, heading in the direction of the Sea of Azov.
The sea is home to major ports of both Russia and Ukraine, and can be reached only through the Russian-controlled Kerch Strait near where Sunday's incident took place.
A court in Crimea's capital Simferopol on Wednesday ordered nine of the 24 captured Ukrainian sailors - including senior Ukrainian naval officers and at least one member of Ukraine's SBU intelligence agency - held for a period of two months. The same court ordered the other 15 sailors on Tuesday to be detained for two months pending a possible trial.
All of the sailors face jail terms of up to six years if found guilty of what Moscow says was a plot to illegally cross the Russian border by trying to pass through the strait without advance notice and ignoring calls to stop.

399,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 02:00PM ET</span>","France, Germany taking charge of EU-Iran trade move but oil sales in doubt","By John Irish, Robin Emmott and Francois Murphy
PARIS/BRUSSELS/VIENNA (Reuters) - France and Germany are to take joint responsibility for an EU-Iran trade mechanism to minimize the risk of U.S. punishment but few now believe it will cover oil sales, heightening fears for the fate of the landmark international nuclear deal with Iran.
Diplomats said the French-German gambit is a ""safety-in-numbers"" tactic to overcome the refusal of individual EU states to host the mechanism to sidestep the risk of being targeted by the revived U.S. sanctions regime against Iran.
But with U.S. threats of retribution for sanctions-busting unrelenting, they told Reuters that the goals of the nascent trade mechanism could be scaled back to encompass only less sensitive items such as humanitarian and food products.
That may well fall short of what Iran's moderates wish for to fend off anti-Western hardliners demanding Tehran ditch the 2015 nuclear deal which they opposed in the first place.
""The SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle for trade) is important, but what's more important to the Iranians is oil and ensuring their exports in the long term,"" said a senior French diplomat.
""None of the measures that we're trying to put in place will perform miracles, but what we're trying to do is a series of measures to convince the Iranians to keep to their nuclear commitments. That is our objective,"" he said.
France, Germany and Britain - European signatories to world powers' 2015 deal with Iran that curbed its disputed nuclear program - have scrambled to come up with measures to preserve its economic benefits for Tehran after U.S. President Donald Trump denounced the accord as weak and withdrew from it in May.
The European Union has so far enabled its lending arm, the European Investment Bank, to add Iran to a list of countries with which it does business and introduced a law to shield European companies from U.S. sanctions.
Both measures are part of a wider package meant to show European good faith to Iran and would be complemented with the so-called SPV, a clearing house that avoids monetary transfers in dollars between the EU and Iran. 
The goal was to have the SPV legally in place by the time Trump reimposed oil sanctions on Iran on Nov. 5, though not operational until next year.
However, after no countries came forward to host the SPV and only Austria and Luxembourg - small states with solid financial systems - refused for fear of incurring U.S. sanctions, France, Germany and Britain were forced to go back to the drawing board.
""What's in the air now is that France or Germany would host or preside over the SPV,"" said an EU diplomat. ""The French are the most pushy and the Germans are more prudent, but at the same time France doesn't want to bear the brunt for everyone else.""
Two other diplomats said that if Paris and Berlin took joint control of the SPV it could deter the Trump administration from directly confronting two major U.S. allies.
Britain is still considering how to contribute, but is restrained by the distracting process of its pending departure from the EU and by the fact the SPV would be trading in euros, not Britain's sterling currency. 
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told the bloc's ministers in a closed-door meeting in Brussels on Nov. 19 that the Paris and Berlin were working closely together to achieve something by year-end, two other EU diplomats said.
The French, German and British finance ministers will discuss the SPV on the sidelines of this weekend's G20 summit, according to a French Finance Ministry source. 
NO MIRACLES
Under the 2015 deal, Iran restricted its declared civilian nuclear power program, widely seen in the West as a front for developing the means to make atomic bombs, in exchange for an end to international sanctions against it.
To circumvent renewed U.S. sanctions, the SPV was conceived as a possible way to help match Iranian oil and gas exports against purchases of EU goods, an effective barter arrangement.
However, those ambitions appear to have been toned down with four diplomats saying the SPV could realistically only be used for smaller trade that might be tolerated by the Trump administration, for example humanitarian or farm products.
Asked whether the mechanism would be able to handle oil sales after all, EU Energy and Climate commissioner Miguel Arias Canete said only that work was continuing.
""We are developing a very sophisticated special purpose vehicle. It is not easy,” Arias Canete said in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday.
The SPV's legal and technical aspects, such as ownership structure, jurisdiction and what banking infrastructure to use if any, were still being finalised, diplomats said.
A person informed of the discussions also said the European Commission was sounding out Washington on the SPV. U.S. officials have repeatedly warned that European banks and firms who engage in the mechanism would be at risk. [nL8N1XQ524]
IRANIAN OIL PRIORITIES
Continued oil sales to mega-energy consumers India and China could be enough for now to satisfy Iran, easing the need for the SPV to immediately cover crude trade, the French diplomat said.
But another EU diplomat was more blunt, arguing that European efforts were symbolic and ultimately any decision by Iran to stay in the nuclear deal would be political and not based on European measures. 
""You can't do big business with pistachios,"" he said, referring to one of Iran's major, but less lucrative, exports.
Highlighting just how sensitive the issue is in Tehran and the possible disconnect between what the EU can do and Iran's aspirations, Iranian officials have repeated to European counterparts in recent meetings that they are under pressure by clerical and security hardliners and cited the possibility and consequences of Iran exiting the deal in the coming weeks. 
""Our priority is to be able to enjoy some banking system for financial transactions and to be able to sell our oil,"" Ali Akhbar Salehi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.
""If the SPV answers the two priorities that I just mentioned..., then yes it could be a workable proposal, it can be helpful in keeping the deal alive.”
But a senior Iranian official close to influential hardliners in the Iranian leadership said the Islamic Republic was losing time ""by betting on the wrong horse”.
""The EU will think about its own interests. The amount of trade with Iran is like a drop compared to the (EU's) ocean of trade with America. They will eventually leave us. Besides, what have we gained so far? Just words.""

KABUL (Reuters) - Gunmen attacked a British security contractors' compound in the Afghan capital Kabul on Wednesday, killing at least 10 people and wounding 19 only hours after President Ashraf Ghani outlined plans for peace in Afghanistan.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, started when a car bomb exploded outside a facility of the  G4S  (CO:G4S) security group on the main road leading out of Kabul toward eastern Afghanistan.
""A number of gunmen entered the G4S compound right after the car bomb,"" said Najib Danish, an Interior Ministry spokesman.
A complex attack on a well-protected site underlines how insecure Kabul remains despite efforts by the United States and the Afghan government to open peace talks with the Taliban to end more than 17 years of war.
""It is unfortunate and events like this bolster our resolve for peace,"" Afghan National Security Advisor Hamdullah Mohib told reporters at the sidelines of a UN-sponsored conference in Geneva where Ghani repeated calls for peace with the Taliban.
The insurgents' main spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the attack had caused heavy casualties and had been launched in retaliation for casualties caused by security forces in the southern provinces of Helmand and Kandahar.
G4S, one of the world's biggest security groups, is one of a number of foreign security contractors operating in Afghanistan and provides guards for the area around the British embassy.
""We can confirm that there has been an incident at one of our locations in Kabul. The situation is ongoing and we are coordinating with Afghan authorities to bring it to a conclusion,"" a statement from G4S said.
An official from the public health ministry said at least 10 bodies and 19 wounded had been taken to city hospitals but with clearance operations still going on late into the night, there was no definitive casualty figure.
""There was a bang and right after that, all the windows and ceiling collapsed over the children. All of the doors were shattered,"" said Hafizullah, a father who had brought three children to a city hospital. The children were wounded in a house near the contractors' compound.
PEACE HOPES
Efforts to open talks with the insurgents have picked up following the appointment of U.S. special peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad earlier this year, but the violence that kills thousands every year has continued.
Three U.S. service members were killed close to the central city of Ghazni on Tuesday and at least 30 Afghan civilians were killed in a U.S. air strike overnight, officials and local residents said.
Last week, more than 50 people were killed in Kabul when a suicide bomber attacked a banquet hall where a meeting of religious leaders was taking place. 
Earlier on Wednesday, three gunmen attacked the Kabul residence of former spy chief Amrullah Saleh but there was no indication of any connection with the GS4 attack.
Earlier Ghani, who faces a re-election battle next year, told a donors conference in Geneva of plans to appoint a team to seek a peace deal, which he said would take at least five years to implement.
However the Taliban, who have sent representatives to meetings with Khalilzad, have so far refused to deal directly with the Kabul government, which they consider an illegitimate foreign-appointed regime.
Security officials have warned that violence is likely to escalate alongside peace moves as the Taliban seek to strengthen their position before any formal negotiations.

""He was planning an attack with ricin and anthrax,"" chief anti-terrorism prosecutor Federico Cafiero De Raho told reporters, naming the man as Alhaj Ahmad Amin.
Amin, 38, who is a legal immigrant and married with three children, was arrested in Macomer earlier in the day by hooded police who forced him from his car as he left home.
It was not immediately possible to contact Amin and the name of his lawyer was not released.
Police said they had been tracking him since September following a tip-off from Lebanon, where his cousin had been arrested after trying to poison a water tank used by the army.
A police official said Amin had tried to buy poison over the internet, but it was not clear if he had succeeded.
Information about poisons and the Islamic State group was found on his mobile phone.
Amin had recently withdrawn all his money from the bank and was searching for his passport, Cafiero De Raho said: ""He must have been close to doing something.""

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean President Sebastian Pinera on Wednesday signed into law a bill allowing people over the age of 14 to change their name and gender in official records, marking a historic shift in a traditionally conservative, predominantly Roman Catholic country.
The bill was first introduced by center-left President Michelle Bachelet, then faced fierce lobbying by conservative and religious groups until its eventual passage by lawmakers in September, nearly five years later.
""I am aware there are varying opinions on this issue,"" the center-right Pinera said in an official act celebrating the law's passage. ""But I am firm in my conviction that we have taken a step in the right direction.""
The law marks an increasingly progressive tack in Chile, an Andean nation until recently dominated by a conservative, Catholic culture. 
Chile legalized divorce in 2004, making it one of the last countries in the world to do so. And the country's ban on abortion, one of the strictest in the world, was lifted in 2017, though for special circumstances only. 
The transgender bill signed into law on Wednesday defines gender identity as a personal conviction of whether a person sees himself or herself as male or female, irrespective of their physical state or the gender or name assigned to them in the country's civic register. 
Children aged 14 to 18 must first obtain the consent of their parents or legal guardians. 
There are no official statistics for the number of trans people in Chile.

GRASSE, France (Reuters) - Perfume-making techniques used in Grasse, a southerly French commune where iris, jasmine and other fragrant plants have long flourished, won U.N. recognition on Wednesday, boosting a bid by local industry champions to lure back more specialist growers. 
The United Nation's cultural agency said it had added the skills linked to cultivating flowers and blending fragrances in Grasse to its list of protected treasures. 
Still considered by perfume manufacturers to be one of the world's most prestigious fragrance centers - owing to a know-how developed over more than five centuries, and a micro-climate favoring the growth of ingredients like tuberose - the number of producers has nonetheless dwindled. 
Some business has shifted to Tunisia or Morocco where production costs are lower, while real estate developers have also made in-roads in a prized corner of the French riviera near Cannes, snapping up what used to be agricultural land. 
Some 30 hectares (74 acres) of land are dedicated to the pursuit today, versus almost 2,000 in the 20th century, though Grasse's city council last week said it had turned 70 hectares of fields marked for potential urban development into an agricultural zone to encourage growers to set up shop. 
A handful of young entrepreneurs trying their hand at flower farming had already helped revitalise one of the industry's most threatened specialities in recent years, according to local senator Jean-Pierre Leleux.
But ""it's still far from what it was in its heyday,"" he added. 
Originally revolving around leather tanning in the 16th century, the flower-based local industry later shifted into fragrances. The produce is still coveted by big luxury companies like Chanel or Guerlain owner LVMH, who also trade off their ""Made in France"" credentials. 
Several local growers said big French brands were increasingly looking to sign exclusive contracts for entire harvests, ensuring their supply of raw materials. France is the world's top perfume exporter. 
Authorities in the region are also looking to set up more formal courses to foment farming or blending skills that used to be passed down within families, at a time when demand for the end product should be on the rise, according to perfume associations, boosted by growing appetite for naturally-sourced cosmetics.

407,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 12:34PM ET</span>","Separated by travel ban, Iranian families reunite at border library","By Yeganeh Torbati
DERBY LINE, VERMONT/STANSTEAD, QUEBEC (Reuters) - During the six-hour drive from New York City to a tiny town in northern Vermont, Iranian student Shirin Estahbanati cried at the thought of seeing her father for the first time in nearly three years. Since then, he had suffered a heart attack, and she hadn't dared leave America to comfort him.
But as she traveled north, she also couldn't stop worrying. What if she missed the turnoff and drove across the U.S.-Canadian border by mistake?
Estahbanati, like many Iranian students in the United States, has a single-entry visa and can't leave the country without risking that she won't be allowed back in. And her parents, as Iranian citizens, are blocked by U.S. President Donald Trump's travel ban from visiting her in the United States.
She didn't want to miss her destination: the Haskell Free Library and Opera House.
Estahbanati and her family had agreed to meet around 9 a.m. at the library, which through a historic anomaly straddles the U.S.-Canada border – and today has been thrust into an unlikely role as the site of emotional reunions between people separated by the administration's immigration policies.
The 31-year-old parked her car and, excitement battling with anxiety, walked to the entrance of the Victorian building. But two hours later, her parents and sister still had not appeared from the Canadian side, and her calls to her sister's cell phone went unanswered.
Finally, she saw them. Because of construction near the library, their GPS device had sent them to the line for the U.S. port of entry. Her parents had no U.S. visas, and they had been detained by American border agents. After approximately two hours, they were released and allowed to join Estahbanati at the library.
When they hugged each other, it felt as if her father had shrunk. He took a deep breath as he held his daughter tight. ""I missed your smell,"" he told her.
Remembering the moment, her smile turned down with the effort not to cry. ""The time I was just hugging my parents,"" she said, ""I was thinking, I wish I could stop all clocks all over the world.""
GEOPOLITICAL GRAY ZONE
This year, as migrant families from Latin America were separated at the U.S. southern border, a more nuanced reality has been playing out on the northern frontier with Canada. Here, dozens of Iranian families have reunited at the Haskell library. Drawn by word-of-mouth and a smattering of social media posts, they have come to the geopolitical gray zone at the rural frontier library, located at once in Derby Line, Vermont, and Stanstead, Quebec.
The Iranian families have undertaken fraught, costly journeys for the chance of a few hours together on the library's grounds. Although several Iranians said they hadn't faced any obstacles from immigration authorities, others said U.S. border officers have at times detained them for several hours, tried to bar them from entering the library, told them they shouldn't be visiting each other there or said they should limit their visits to just a few minutes. American and Canadian officials have threatened to shut the library over the visits, one library staff member said. 
""This is a neutral area, but the U.S. government doesn't accept this situation, and they put a lot of pressure on us,"" said Sina Dadsetan, an Iranian living in Canada who traveled to the library to see his sister the same day Estahbanati saw her family.
The Trump administration says its travel ban is necessary to protect the United States, arguing that the countries in question – Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Yemen and, to a lesser extent, Venezuela – don't share enough information that would confirm their citizens are not a threat, or are the source of terrorism threats. 
Officials with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which oversees the Border Patrol, declined a request for an interview about the library. A spokesman, Michael McCarthy, declined to comment on the families' accounts of their interactions with U.S. border officials or on the library staff member's allegation that U.S. and Canadian authorities have threatened to close it. 
""U.S. Border Patrol works closely with our Canadian counterparts, as well as the local community, to prevent illegal cross border activity,"" McCarthy said in a statement. 
Erique Gasse, a spokesman for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Canada's federal law enforcement agency, denied that the agency had threatened to shut the library down. ""This is not the way we talk,"" he said. ""We don't do that.""
He insisted the RCMP doesn't patrol the area regularly and only goes there when called. ""We don't have any problem with the library,"" he said.
Mahsa Izadmehr, an Iranian doctoral student in engineering at the University of Illinois-Chicago, had gone seven years without seeing her younger sister, who lives in Switzerland. In late September, they met at the library.
But as they approached each other at the border, demarcated outside the library by a line of flower pots, a U.S. Border Patrol agent quickly got out of a car parked close by.
""He said, 'It's been about a month that we've closed this; we don't allow anyone to meet here,'"" Izadmehr said. ""I asked him, 'Can you at least give me permission to hug my sister?'""
The agent allowed them to embrace but barred them from exchanging the gifts they had brought – dresses, Swiss chocolates and a watch – and kept a close eye on them as they talked from opposite sides of the flower pots. 
The sisters finally entered the library when a staff member offered them a tour, but Border Patrol agents later chastised the staff member, said Izadmehr, who witnessed the exchange. McCarthy declined to comment on the incident.
Richard Creaser, chairman of the Derby Line village trustees, said he understands why the family visits would be a ""point of tension"" for Border Patrol officials, because the Iranians have to walk onto American soil to enter.
""I could see where that would be an issue,"" Creaser said.
The Supreme Court upheld Trump's travel ban this summer after a lengthy legal battle. Of the people affected by the ban, it is by far Iranians who study most frequently in the United States and who tend to be middle class and can afford international travel.
Several Iranians told Reuters they've also met in recent months at Peace Arch park, located at once in Washington state and British Columbia, on the western coast of North America. But for families with members in major eastern cities, the cost of crossing the continent can be prohibitive, leaving the Haskell library as their only choice.
Even so, Sina Dadsetan and his sister estimated their family spent more than $1,600 on their two-day reunion at Haskell, not including their parents' air travel from Iran, for what would be approximately 10 hours together.
The library is vulnerable to pressure from authorities because although the building sits on American and Canadian land, its entrance is on the U.S. side. U.S. officials allow staff and visitors from Canada to walk a few yards onto American soil without going through an official port of entry.
""Often there's altercations with either RCMP or (U.S.) border security,"" head librarian Joel Kerr said in a brief interview in early November, on a day in which two Iranian families reunited at the library. ""They mostly harass us and threaten to shut us down.""
Kerr, who started in his position in October, said he couldn't provide any details of how the agencies had threatened to shut down the library. Members of the library's board of trustees, which recently issued a policy barring the visits, either did not respond to requests for comment or declined to comment at length.
A RELIC OF A TIME LONG GONE
The library is a relic of a time when Americans and Canadians, residents say, could cross the border with simply a nod and a wave at border agents. It was the gift of a local family in the early 1900s to serve the nearby Canadian and American communities.
""What we are so proud of is that we do have a library that is accessed by one single door,"" said Susan Granfors, a former library board member. ""You don't need your passport. You park on your side, I'll park on my side, but we're all going to walk in the same door.""
But after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the northern border hardened, and the law enforcement presence in the area is immediately visible. And in September, a Canadian man was sentenced to 51 months in prison for smuggling more than 100 guns into Canada, some of them through the Haskell library.
Still, inside the building itself – decorated with wood paneling, stained-glass windows and, on the Canadian side, a moose head – the old ways mostly prevail. Patrons and staff freely cross the international boundary, marked with a thin, flaking black line extending across the brightly decorated children's reading room and the main hallway.
On the morning of Aug. 14, Estahbanati parked her car in the library's small lot and walked to its gray granite entrance. That's where she encountered Sina Dadsetan and his parents around 11 a.m., when they arrived at the library for their own reunion with his sister Saba, an Iranian student living in Pennsylvania.
As the Dadsetan family approached the library from the opposite sides of the border, Estahbanati, in tears, asked them if they had seen her family. They had not.
But when the Estahbanatis, too, had finally reunited, it was not the end of the families' problems that day. Nearby construction had cut off water to the library, and it was unexpectedly closed. A library staff member had given the families written permission to meet on its grounds, but Border Patrol agents objected to their meeting there.
""It was really stressful, because I just wanted to be with my parents,"" Estahbanati said. She pleaded with the agents, and they relented, allowing them to meet outside the library for 20 minutes. That 20 minutes passed, and though the agents watched from close by, they allowed the families to meet for several hours that day.
On the second day the Estahbanatis and Dadsetans met at the library, at least two other Iranian families were also there, they said. Several of the mothers had cooked elaborate Iranian dishes for their children to enjoy.
Estahbanati had asked her mother to make her childhood favorite, a crunchy, layered rice dish called tahchin. Her mother had even brought some saffron from Iran to use in the dish. 
""She was happy that she can cook for me,"" Estahbanati said, ""and I was glad that I could have that food that my mother had made herself.""
'FAMILY GATHERINGS ARE NOT PERMITTED'
It is difficult to know exactly how many families have reunited at the library, but a signature book near the front entrance shows around 12 obviously Iranian names between March and November. Reuters identified seven other families, all Iranian, who had visited the library or tried to do so this year.
People with a close connection to the library were reluctant to speak about the visits, worried that publicizing them would draw more families, attract more pressure from authorities, or both.
""We are trying to be very neutral,"" Patricia Hunt, a current board member, said in a brief phone interview. She declined to comment further.
Kerr, the librarian, said he planned to hold a meeting between library officials and both countries' authorities to draw up a plan to deal with the visits.
""We don't want to put a stop to it, necessarily, but we need to somehow control it in order for us to stay open,"" Kerr said. ""It's basically only tolerated by both sides, because technically, it shouldn't really be allowed.""
On a Saturday in early November, two Iranian families met at the library, chatting quietly in its two reading rooms. The normal business of the library continued amid the tearful reunions and goodbyes in its corners: Parents and children streamed in and out to return books and browse the stacks. Teenagers accessed the internet on library computers and leafed through its DVD collection.
The Iranians were mostly oblivious to signs stating in English and French that, by order of the library's board of trustees, ""family gatherings are not permitted."" Kerr said the signs had gone up just the week before.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - After evading arrest for two months, Sri Lanka's most senior military official appeared in court on Wednesday, charged with helping another suspect in the abduction and disappearance of 11 youths in the final phase of the country's 26-year civil war.
Chief of Defense Staff Ravindra Wijegunaratne will now be held in detention till Dec. 5 pending further investigations into whether he aided and abetted the prime suspect in the case. 
Colombo Fort Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake refused to offer bail to Wijegunaratne, an admiral and former chief of the navy, saying the suspect might seek to hamper investigations into the case.
""There could be influence on the investigators and witnesses given the position of the second suspect,"" Dissanayake told the court.
Wijegunaratne's lawyer denied the allegations against his client.
The inquiry into the abduction of 11 youths in 2008 has been closely monitored by international rights groups as Sri Lanka tries to address past rights abuses.
Many people are believed to have been abducted in 2006-2008 - the final phase of the civil war - by government paramilitary personnel under former president Mahinda Rajapaksa's administration for alleged links to Tamil Tiger rebels.
Rajapaksa himself has been accused of war crimes by international rights groups, and the U.N. has asked for a thorough investigation into alleged human rights violations. 
Rajapaksa, who was appointed as prime minister last month before being rejected by parliament in two confidence votes, has denied the allegations.
There are no clear records of the missing from the nearly 26-year conflict, but a missing person's commission has received 20,000 complaints.

409,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 12:05PM ET</span>",Brazil nixes plans to host U.N. climate conference,"SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil's government has backed out of its offer to host the United Nations climate conference next year due to budget constraints and a presidential transition, Brazil's Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday. 
The conference is slated to be held in November next year. Last month, the Foreign Ministry announced Brazil's offer to host the event in a press release, saying the meeting would work out final details of the Paris climate agreement and for signatory countries to fully implement its demands by 2020.
Hosting the event would have confirmed Brazil's ""role as a world leader on sustainable development issues, especially in relation to climate change."" 
But in its emailed statement on Wednesday, the ministry said that after it carried out a detailed analysis that focused ""on the financial needs associated with the event,"" it was decided that the cost would be too much for the country to bear.
Brazil, which has 60 percent of the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest within its borders, a biome scientists consider one of nature's best defenses against global warming as it acts as a giant carbon sink, has made significant strides in the past 15 years to curtail destruction of the jungle. 
However, Brazil's government reported last week that annual deforestation levels had hit their highest level in a decade.
Critics said the decision to not host the climate conference was related to the election in late October of right-wing President-elect Jair Bolsonaro, who will take office on Jan. 1. 
""The reversal to host the meeting is likely because of the opposition of the incoming government, which has already declared war on sustainable development on multiple occasions,"" the environmental group Observatorio da Clima said in a release on its website. ""It's not the first and will not be the last awful news from Jair Bolsonaro on this theme."" 
Aides to Bolsonaro did not immediately reply to requests for comment. 
Bolsonaro has antagonized environmentalists by threatening to pull Brazil out of the Paris climate accord, although he also said late in October that he was not set on such a move if elected.
Bolsonaro, who has called conservation efforts a threat to Brazilian sovereignty, had also sought to combine the environmental and agricultural ministries but later retreated from that proposal as well.

James Sean Shields was driving to the beach with his girlfriend on the morning of Saturday, Jan. 13, when the state flashed out alerts onto phones across the islands: ""BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.""
The message came at a time of rising tensions between the United States and North Korea, which had claimed it had developed a ballistic missile that could reach the U.S. mainland. It sent thousands of island residents in a panicked search for shelter before the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency recalled the message a half-hour later, saying it had been sent in error.
Shields and his girlfriend filed the lawsuit in the state's First Circuit Court on Tuesday, the state's online docket showed.
""They decided that there was not much they could do to protect themselves from this threat and decided that if they were going to die, they might as well die together on the beach,"" the lawsuit said, according to a copy published by Hawaii News Now.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified financial damages.
Soon after phone calls to say goodbye to his loved ones, including his son and daughter on the U.S. mainland, Shields felt pain and burning in his chest, the lawsuit said.
The couple rushed to a hospital, missing the follow-up message more than 30 minutes later from the state's Emergency Management Agency saying the alert was sent in error.
Shields' heart stopped at the hospital and he underwent emergency surgery to save his life, the lawsuit said.
Shields' girlfriend, Brenda Reichel, is also a plaintiff in the lawsuit, seeking unspecified damages for the emotional upset of watching her boyfriend have a heart attack and ""almost die on several occasions.""
The state's attorney general and the Emergency Management Agency could not immediately be reached for comment, nor could the couple's lawyers.
An investigation found that the employee who sent the alarm had mistaken an alert drill for an actual attack. The employee was fired shortly after the incident.

The Federal Communication Commission's investigation into the false alert concluded in April that a ""combination of human error and inadequate safeguards"" were to blame.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The U.S. ambassador to Israel called on Palestinians on Wednesday to free an American-Palestinian who, the envoy said, was detained for ""selling land to a Jew"", apparently violating a long-standing Palestinian ban on selling land to Israelis.
Through its official Wafa news agency, the Palestinian Authority has accused property dealer Issam Akel, a U.S. citizen, of attempting to sell a property in East Jerusalem without permission of his business partners or the authorities. The Wafa report did not identify the intended buyer.
Palestinian law bars selling land to ""a hostile state or any of its citizens"", and requires the permission of the Palestinain Authority for all land sales in East Jerusalem.
Land sales in the Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, are highly fraught for Palestinians, who see Israeli efforts to buy up land as part of a plot to cement control. Around 500,000 Israelis live in settlements in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, which most foreign powers consider a violation of international law against settling occupied land.
""The Pal(estinian) Authority has been holding US citizen Isaam Akel in prison for ~2 months. His suspected 'crime'? Selling land to a Jew,"" U.S. Ambassador David Friedman wrote on Twitter. 
""Akel’s incarceration is antithetical to the values of the US & to all who advocate the cause of peaceful coexistence. We demand his immediate release.""
Osama Al-Qawasme, an official from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah movement, rejected Friedman's remarks and called the U.S. envoy ""an ambassador of the settlers"".
""We deplore his statement that Akel's arrest violated American values. Does building of settlements adhere to American values?"" Al Qawasme said. ""We in Fatah will confront all attempts to harm the city of Jerusalem or its sacred places.""
Akel's father, Jalal, said a Palestinian court had extended his son's detention by 45 days on Monday.
""They are stalling. There is no evidence my son sold anything to Israelis, all charges are void,"" the father told Reuters.
Palestinians consider East Jerusalem to be the capital of their hoped-for future independent state. Israel captured the territory in a 1967 war and has annexed it as part of its own capital in a move not recognized internationally.
Major-General Adnan Al-Dmairi, a spokesman for the Palestinian security forces, said 20 people had been arrested in recent years on suspicion of violating land laws.
An Israeli security official told Reuters Akel was detained on Oct 10 in Ramallah, the hub city of the Palestinian Authority in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Israel said its security services had appealed to their Palestinian counterparts for Akel's release. Despite the collapse of peace talks in 2014, Israel and the Palestinians still coordinate to help stabilize the West Bank.

Israel briefly arrested two Palestinian Authority officials from East Jerusalem over the last month on the basis of what the Israeli security official said were suspicions that they had information on Akel's detention. One of the Palestinian officials was re-arrested this week.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Ethiopia has overtaken Dubai as a conduit for long-haul passengers to Africa, highlighting the success of the state airline's expansion drive and the reforms of its new prime minister. 
Travel consultancy ForwardKeys said on Wednesday Addis Ababa airport had increased the number of international transfer passengers to sub-Saharan Africa for five years in a row, and in 2018 had surpassed Dubai, one of the world's busiest airports, as the transfer hub for long-haul travel to the region.
Analyzing data from travel booking systems that record 17 million flight bookings a day, ForwardKeys found the number of long-haul transfers to sub-Saharan Africa via Addis Ababa jumped by 85 percent from 2013 to 2017. Transfers via Dubai over the same period rose by 31 percent. 
So far this year, Addis Ababa's growth is 18 percent, versus 3 percent for Dubai.
Dubai has long been a major global air travel hub because it is the base of Gulf carrier Emirates. Given the lack of an ""open skies"" deal smoothing flights across Africa, many passengers traveling between one part of the continent and another, or from Asia or Europe to Africa, must often transit through Dubai.
But this is changing. 
Ethiopian Airlines (ETHA.UL), the country's most successful state company, is accelerating a 15-year strategy it launched in 2010 to win back market share on routes to and from Africa that are dominated by Turkish Airlines and Emirates. 
It is also weaving a patchwork of new African routes to rapidly expanding and lucrative Asian markets. 
ForwardKeys also attributed the recent jump in bookings via Addis Ababa in part to a positive international response to the broad reforms introduced by Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who came to power in April and has upended politics in the Horn of Africa country of around 105 million people.
It cited two changes in particular: a move to allow visitors to apply for visas online, and Abiy's pledge to open Ethiopia's largely state-controlled economy to foreign investment. 
After Abiy made peace with Eritrea to end a two-decade state of war, Ethiopian resumed flights to its neighbor in July. This month, it relaunched flights to Somalia's capital after four decades.
And the rise of travel via Addis Ababa looks set to continue. International bookings via Ethiopia are up 40 percent year-on-year for November to January 2019, ahead of all other destinations in Africa, ForwardKeys said.

414,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 10:30AM ET</span>",Bangladesh attorney general says jailed leader Khaleda cannot contest election,"By Ruma Paul and Zeba Siddiqui
DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh's jailed opposition leader Khaleda Zia cannot run for office in next month's election, the country's top law officer said on Wednesday, increasing the uncertainty over the party's prime ministerial candidate.
Khaleda, who has twice been the country's prime minister and shares a long-standing rivalry with the current leader Sheikh Hasina, was jailed in February after being convicted for misappropriation of funds for an orphanage. 
She denies the allegations and says it is aimed at keeping her away from politics.
Her ability to contest the polls has been in doubt since her incarceration but colleagues in her Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) have said they were hoping she would be released ahead of the elections. 
With weeks to go for the Dec. 30 polls though, Attorney General Mahbubey Alam said on Wednesday that, according to the law, even if Khaleda was released from jail, she would not be allowed to contest the polls. 
His comments came a day after the Bangladesh high court ruled against petitions filed by five BNP members convicted of corruption who sought a stay on their sentences to stand in the election, Alam said. 
One of the petitioners appealed that ruling at the Supreme Court, which has refused to intervene.
“So (Khaleda’s) case cannot be considered any differently,” Alam said. 
The BNP's secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam condemned the high court ruling in comments to local media, saying it was aimed at preventing Khaleda from taking part in the election. 
The party plans to appeal the high court order at the Supreme Court, its lawyer Khandaker Mahmud Hossain said, adding that it continued to work on securing bail for Khaleda.
Hasina is widely expected to win the election, although analysts say the formation of a joint opposition alliance has meant the race would be more competitive. 
The BNP has been in disarray since Khaleda was jailed and scores of its members have been detained and some convicted in recent months on charges it terms as fictitious. 
If Khaleda is barred from running, it would be the first time the BNP will go to polls without her at the helm, Islam told reporters earlier in the week, breaking down in tears. 
The BNP forged an alliance with three smaller parties last month, seeking to unseat Hasina from her decade-long reign. 
But the opposition still does not have a clear prime ministerial candidate, and the alliance leader Kamal Hossain has said he is not seeking a ministerial post. 

A decision on who should be prime minister will be taken after the opposition alliance wins, Islam told Reuters last week, adding the coalition had ""several eligible candidates"".

416,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 10:07AM ET</span>",Angry farmers could upset India's Modi in major state elections test,"By Rajendra Jadhav
SEHORE/BHOPAL, INDIA (Reuters) - Weak farm prices are threatening to hurt Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party as it faces a critical test in three state elections dominated by rural voters in the Hindi-speaking belt that is its traditional stronghold.
On a visit last week to the most crucial of the three states, Madhya Pradesh, which was voting on Wednesday, Reuters spoke to 134 rural voters along a 400 km (250 miles) corridor - 89, or about two-thirds, said they would vote for the opposition Congress party rather than the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
""Diesel and fertilizer prices have shot up but paddy and wheat prices rose only marginally,"" said Prem Naryan Meena, a 60-year-old wheat farmer in Gudari Ghat village on the outskirts of Madhya Pradesh's state capital Bhopal. ""Our net realization has been falling every year."" 
Meena says he will vote Congress for the first time in his life because the BJP has failed to lift farmers' earnings as promised. He voted BJP in the last state and general elections. 
The latest survey from pollster C Voter puts Congress marginally ahead in both Madhya Pradesh and the second of the Hindi-speaking states, Chhattisgarh, where voting has been completed. Congress has an 8.2 percentage-point lead in the third state, Rajasthan, according to the survey. All three results are expected on Dec. 11.
""WE CAN'T EAT ROADS""
The BJP currently controls all three states, and if it loses more than one it could prompt a re-think of its strategy heading into next year's general election, which is due to be held by May.
Political strategists say that could mean trying to find quick ways to bolster incomes in the countryside through additional subsidies. It could also mean forcefully playing the ""Hindus-first"" card, which they say could appeal to the majority population but risk creating communal conflict.
Investors are also likely to take fright if the pro-business BJP suffers major losses. It would create major policy uncertainty by raising the prospects that Modi could either lose next year's election or be faced with forming a much less powerful coalition government.
The BJP's message still can resonate in rural areas on the back of some of the government's development initiatives. These include a push for access to electricity, provision of better sanitation, subsidies for cooking systems run off liquefied petroleum gas, and better roads.
But that is not enough for many farmers struggling with low crop prices.
""Government says they are working to double farmers' income, but instead of rising, crop prices are falling. We sold soybean at 5,000 rupees (per 100 kg) in 2014 and now we are getting 2,900 rupees,"" said 30-year-old farmer Anil Verma, from the Sehore district, 50 km from Bhopal.
And while voters acknowledge the improved roads, some such as Ramnaryan Gour, a taxi driver in Bhopal, do not see it as enough of a reason to support the BJP.
""We can't eat roads. Our income should go up, which is not happening,"" said Gaur, who plans to vote for Congress.
PARALYZED TRADING
The government points to initiatives such as improved irrigation, crop insurance and electronic trading platforms for farmers to sell produce as evidence it has helped rural Indians, who make up around 70 percent of the 1.3 billion population. 
But the low farm prices can also be at least partially blamed on government policies.
After coming to power, the Modi administration tried to bring down food inflation by raising crop procurement prices much less than its predecessor, cutting import taxes on various farm commodities and restricting overseas sales of some crops. These policies, along with a supply glut overseas, hurt crop prices in India.
Then the government in 2016 scrapped high value currency notes as it sought to crack down on the black economy. That paralyzed trading of farm commodities and dragged prices down further.
The national government has more recently been trying to support rural incomes by steeply raising minimum support prices for summer-sown crops – prices at which the government says it is prepared to buy the crops from the farmers. But farmers have been selling crops at as much as a 30 percent discount to these prices when they have a big supply glut because a lack of storage and transport capacity means the government system does not function effectively.
And the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh has been on the back foot since six farmers protesting against lower prices in mid-2017 were shot and killed by police in Mandsaur district. The incident angered farmers and prompted Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan to offer them concessions.
The state rolled out a program that promised to pay farmers the difference between the actual crop sale price and the government mandated price.
    But it did not work as traders profited from the scheme and the difference between market prices and support prices widened further, according to Deviprasad Mandloi, who grows black lentils in Sehore.
    Growers of garlic, onion and tomatoes – all big crops in the state - have been hit particularly hard as prices have plunged. 
""In garlic we are not recovering half of the production cost,"" said Deepak Yogi, showing a reporter garlic bags stored in a cattle shed in Sehore. 
    Garlic prices have fallen to 9 rupees a kg, from nearly 100 rupees a kg in January 2017.
If the farmers' sentiments are reflected across Madhya Pradesh, which has been held by the BJP for the past three terms, or 15 years, then it will be a major defeat for Modi.
Congress has been trying to tap into farmers' discontent with promises to waive farm loans. 
After winning all three state elections in late 2013, the BJP won 62 out of 65 seats - 27 out of 29 in Madhya Pradesh - that those states sent to the 545-member lower house in the 2014 general election.
A poor performance by the BJP in the three ""will be indicative of slipping ground in strongholds,"" said Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a biographer of Modi. It would also make Congress more credible and put it in a stronger position to negotiate alliances with smaller regional parties, he said.
The expectation in financial markets is that the BJP will win at least two of the three states.

If the BJP loses all three ""then there would be a sell-off in the market,"" said Sanjay Mookim, India equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), adding that there would be concerns that an unstable coalition government may result.

Thai billionaire businessman Vichai, 60, and four others died when their helicopter crashed and exploded outside the King Power Stadium after a Premier League game against West Ham.
William, President of the English Football Association, and Kate met Vichai's wife, son and daughter at a dedicated tribute site bedecked in flowers, scarves and flags set up in his memory near where the accident occurred.
As they approached, the couple bowed their heads and Kate laid a bouquet of flowers. An accompanying hand-written note read: ""To Vichai, and all those who have lost their lives in this terrible tragedy, you will be sadly missed. Our sincere condolences to the city.""
It was signed ""William"" and ""Catherine"". 
The royals, officially known as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, then met Leicester manager Claude Puel, a group of players including club captain Wes Morgan, England striker Jamie Vardy and goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel as well as club supporters and volunteers.
Vichai bought the unheralded central England side in 2010 and went on to stun the soccer world by beating odds of 5,000/1 to win the Premier League title in 2016.
""Their Royal Highnesses knew the Club’s Chairman, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, and wanted to visit the city to recognize the warmth and compassion that the people of Leicester and fans of Leicester City Football Club have shown in reaction to the accident,"" William's office said in a statement.
The couple were later due to go to the University of Leicester to meet representatives of local charities and educational programs that Srivaddhanaprabha and the club have supported. 
Earlier this month, British air accident investigators looking into the cause of the helicopter crash said they were focusing on a problem with the tail rotor system.

The 53-year-old woman worked at a publicly funded nursery for 15 years until a 2014 review revealed she had faked a certificate to say she had completed all 6 years of primary school.
The woman dropped out in the fifth grade, but doctored a school report to add another year. That allowed her to work as a cleaner until the discrepancy was discovered and she was fired.
The appeals court in the town of Larissa suspended the sentence on humanitarian grounds on Wednesday, but the conviction itself will still be examined by the Supreme Court.
""The court ... accepted the petition for a suspension,"" George Sinellis, the woman's lawyer, told journalists. ""That means (she) will today leave jail.""

The case caused outrage in Greece, where ordinary people complain about corruption among the elite, convicted terrorists allowed time out of jail, and lighter sentences for much more serious offences.

ONITSHA, Nigeria (Reuters) - The main challenger in Nigeria's election next year aims to outflank Muhammadu Buhari by campaigning in a sometimes neglected part of the country where the president is deeply unpopular: the southeast.
With a tight race in prospect, a strong showing there could give Atiku Abubakar the votes he needs to deny Buhari, a former military ruler, a second four-year term as the elected leader of one of Africa's most powerful nations. 
Abubakar is targeting regional voters - who are mostly members of the Igbo ethnic group - through his choice of a local running mate and policies designed to meet calls for autonomy. 
The numbers are tempting. There were 7.5 million registered voters in the five states of the southeast out of 67.4 million nationwide at the last election, in 2015. 
The number of new voters registered in the southeast has grown faster than in other regions, according to electoral commission figures seen by Reuters. 
The opposition will still need to overcome voter apathy in the southeast, where people have long felt there is little point in voting since presidents tend to be northerners from the Hausa ethnic group or Yoruba people from the southwest.
While presidential elections in Nigeria are usually cast as a fight between the mainly Muslim north and the predominantly Christian south, victory may depend on a candidate attracting votes from outside his ethnic and religious base.
At this stage, most analysts expect a closely fought contest on Feb. 16, with some predicting a narrow victory for Abubakar. 
ELECTORAL SENSE
Buhari is popular across the north, so it suits Abubakar to target a region where the president lacks support.
Buhari's unpopularity in the southeast stems from his decision to send troops on to the streets last year to crack down on secessionists.
The issue is sensitive. For many, the deployment was a reminder of the 1967-70 war over Biafra, a short-lived breakaway nation that was predominantly Igbo.
Around a million people died, mostly from starvation and disease, before central government forces prevailed, and many in the southeast feel Igbos have been marginalized ever since. An Igbo has not been president or vice president since Nigeria's most recent transition to civilian rule in 1999. 
If there are votes for Abubakar in the southeast, he may also win support among the many Igbos living elsewhere in Nigeria. 
Abubakar named Peter Obi, a former southeastern governor, as his running mate in October and proposed devolving more power to regions in a policy dubbed ""restructuring"" that promises to give states greater control over their finances.
Advertising hoardings for the opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP) featuring Abubakar's smiling face alongside that of Obi outnumber those for Buhari in the southeastern cities of Onitsha and Enugu.
Chukwunonye Okereke, director general of Southeast Youths for Atiku, a PDP organization, said: ""The people in the southeast have not been treated fairly by this government. He (Buhari) has been a ruler of marginalization.""
Abubakar himself said in a tweet earlier this month: ""I am 100% for 100% of Nigerians 100% of the time. Nigerians should never be divided by ethnic or religious lines. We must be united. We are ONE Nigeria.""
The comment may have struck a chord in the southeast since it reflects criticism that Buhari has governed as a northern president concerned only with northern people.
A group of influential Igbo traditional rulers earlier this month endorsed Abubakar - a move that gives them potential access to important patronage networks if he wins. 
Buhari is unpopular among market stallholders and shoppers in Onitsha, the biggest city in Anambra State. 
""I don't want Buhari any longer in this country. We pray there will be a change,"" said Ifeoma Eze, who runs a business selling plantains. 
""In Nigeria everybody is crying - there is no money. The money is not circulating,"" she said, complaining about the government's handling of the economy, which experienced its first recession in 25 years in 2016, only emerging last year. 
'ECONOMIC INSTABILITY' 
Eric Onyeka, who runs a toiletries stall, said: ""We have had economic instability since 2015,"" - the year Buhari took office. 
Buhari's supporters say much criticism is based on ethnic and religious prejudices rather than his policies. 
""The current infrastructure that has been put in place surpasses what the People's Democratic Party did in 16 years,"" said Ebubeagu Okafor, a spokesman for Buhari's All Progressives Congress (APC) in Enugu.
He said Buhari's administration had improved roads between the region's major cities and was developing a railway line to link the southeast with the oil heartland and the northeast. 
Okafor also cited the resumption of building work on the Second Niger Bridge, a major river crossing, as an example of Buhari's commitment to the region.
Abubakar is thought to be betting that Buhari's largesse may not be enough to win the region.
""Atiku is probably banking on a growing voter population in these traditional PDP strongholds, combined with a higher turnout of Igbo voters who want to see an Igbo vice president,"" said Malte Liewerscheidt, West Africa analyst at Teneo, a consultancy.
Liewerscheidt also said Abubakar's courting of the Igbo vote could help him elsewhere. 
""Igbo support could also prove decisive in other regions, particularly the southwest, as there are huge Igbo communities scattered across the country. In a key battleground state such as Lagos, this could swing the vote in Atiku's favor,"" he said.

423,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 08:55AM ET</span>",UK court rejects 'politically motivated' Turkish extradition request,"LONDON (Reuters) - A British court has rejected an extradition request from Turkey for exiled businessman Akin Ipek to face terrorism-funding, fraud and other charges, saying he faced a real risk of ill-treatment should he be returned.
Ipek, 54, built a multi-billion-dollar fortune in Turkey based on gold mining but left the country in 2015 after relations between the government and followers of U.S.-based Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen soured.
Ankara accused Gulen, a former ally of President Tayyip Erdogan, of orchestrating a 2016 failed coup attempt and has carried out a widespread crackdown targeting his alleged followers. Gulen has denied any involvement.
Ipek and two other men, Ali Celik and Talip Buyuk, who are said by Ankara to be high-ranking members of Gulen's organisation (FETO), were arrested by Britain earlier this year following extradition requests from Turkey.
They were accused of a series of charges including fundraising for terrorism, fraud and conspiracy to launder proceeds of crime.
John Zani, District Judge at London's Westminster Magistrates' Court, said while he had ""serious reservations about the current state of the rule of law in Turkey"", he accepted the men would receive a fair trial there.
But he rejected the extradition requests saying the men risked ill-treatment on their return.
""I am persuaded ... that there is substantial evidence that this request is politically motivated,"" Zani said in his ruling.
""I am entirely satisfied that, by reason of their actual or perceived political views, coupled with the assertion by the Turkish authorities that they are part of the hierarchy of the Gulenist Movement, each defendant before this court runs a real risk of Article 3 (of the Human Rights Act) breaches.""
The Turkish government is expected to appeal to London's High Court against the decision, while the justice minister said the verdict could not be accepted. 
""It is an unacceptable ruling that our extradition request for FETO fugitives Akin Ipek, Ali Celik and Talip Buyuk was rejected by Britain,"" said Abdulhamit Gul. 
""Our struggle will continue until the members of the terrorist organisation are brought to Turkish justice.""
In 2015, Turkey seized Ipek's Koza-Ipek Group and its media outlets, including broadcasters and newspapers, on suspicion of financial irregularities, prompting criticism from rights groups in Turkey and abroad.
Turkish authorities have taken control of hundreds of firms as part of a crackdown on companies it suspects of links to Gulen and his supporters. The government has also shut down more than 130 media outlets as part of the purges.

LASHKAR GAH, Afghanistan (Reuters) - At least 30 Afghan civilians were killed in U.S. air strikes in the Afghan province of Helmand, officials and residents of the area said on Wednesday, the latest casualties from a surge in air operations aimed at driving the Taliban into talks.
Afghanistan's NATO-led force said Afghan government forces and U.S. advisers came under fire from Taliban fighters in a compound in Garmsir district and called in an air strike, but the ground forces were not aware of any civilians in or near the compound.
Helmand provincial governor Mohammad Yasin Khan said troops had called in air strikes against Taliban fighters in Garmsir, causing both civilian and Taliban casualties.
A resident of the area called Mohammadullah said the clash began late on Tuesday.
""Foreign forces bombed the area and the bombs hit my brother's house,"" he said.
He said women and 16 children were among the dead.
Another resident, Feda Mohammad, said some victims were still buried in the rubble of the compound.
""The area is under the control of Taliban but all of the victims of last night's bombing are civilians,"" he said.
The NATO-led Resolute Support forces said Afghan forces and U.S. advisers came under fire from Taliban equipped with machines guns and rocket-propelled grenades.
""At the time of the strike, the ground force was unaware of any civilians in or around the compound; they only knew that the Taliban was using the building as a fighting position,"" a force spokeswoman said in a statement.
""We investigate every credible allegation of error and review every mission to learn, adapt and improve,"" she said.
The deaths are the latest in a growing civilian casualty toll caused by air strikes and underline the severity of the Afghan war even as moves to begin peace talks have picked up with contacts between U.S. peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban representatives.
The United Nations said last month the number of civilian casualties from air strikes in the first nine months of the year was already higher than in any entire year since at least 2009.
The increase has come together with a sharp jump in the number of air operations under a U.S. strategy aimed at stepping up pressure on the Taliban to force them to accept a negotiated end to the 17-year war.
According to figures from the U.S. military, U.S. aircraft had released 5,213 weapons by the end of September, up from 4,361 for the entire 2017 and the highest number since 2011 when there were more than 100,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan.

The boy's mother briefly spoke to the pope as she tried to pull the child away, saying that he was mute. Pope Francis told her to let him carry on playing.
""This child cannot speak. He is mute. But he can communicate,"" the pope told hundreds of pilgrims. ""And he has something that got me thinking: he is free. Unruly ... but he is free,"" he added to laughter.

Flight MH370 was on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014, with 239 people on board, when it disappeared and became one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries.
Malaysian and international investigators believe the jet veered thousands of miles off course from its scheduled route before eventually plunging into the Indian Ocean.
But no one knows why.
In all, 27 pieces of aircraft debris have been collected from various places around the world but only three wing fragments that washed up along the Indian Ocean coast have been confirmed to be from MH370.
The next of kin said in a brief statement on Wednesday they would meet Malaysia's transport minister on Friday ""to hand over newly recovered debris"".
Calvin Shim, whose wife was a crew member on the plane, told Reuters that the group planned to hand over five pieces of debris found off Madagascar, where some debris has been found before.
The most recent discovery was in August, he said. 
In May, Malaysia called off a three-month search by U.S. firm Ocean Infinity, which spanned 112,000 sq km (43,243 sq miles) in the southern Indian Ocean and ended with no significant findings.
It was the second major search after Australia, China and Malaysia ended a fruitless A$200 million ($144.80 million) search across an area of 120,000 sq km (46,332 sq miles) last year.
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad had said in May that the country would consider resuming the search only if new clues come to light.

In July, investigators released a 495-page report, saying the plane's controls were likely deliberately manipulated to take it off course but they were not able to determine who was responsible.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - A Chinese scientist at the center of an ethical storm over what he claims are the world's first genetically edited babies said on Wednesday he is proud of his work and revealed there was a second ""potential"" pregnancy as part of the research. 
He Jiankui, an associate professor at Southern (NYSE:SO) University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China, addressed a packed hall of around 700 people attending the Human Genome Editing Summit at the University of Hong Kong.
""For this case, I feel proud. I feel proudest,"" He said, when challenged by several peers at the conference. 
Asked whether there were any other edited gene pregnancies as part of his trials, He said there was another ""potential"" pregnancy and replied ""yes"" to a follow-up question as to whether it was a ""chemical pregnancy"", which refers to an early-stage miscarriage.
It was unclear whether the pregnancy had ended or not.
He, who said his work was self-funded, shrugged off concerns that the research was conducted in secrecy, explaining that he had engaged the scientific community over the past three years.
""This study has been submitted to a scientific journal for review,"" He said. He did not name the journal and said his university was unaware of his study. 
In videos posted online this week, He said he used a gene-editing technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 to alter the embryonic genes of twin girls born this month.
He said gene editing would help protect the girls from infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
But scientists and the Chinese government have denounced the work that He said he carried out, and a hospital linked to his research suggested its ethical approval had been forged. 
The conference moderator, Robin Lovell-Badge, said the summit organizers were unaware of the story until it broke this week. 
CRISPR-Cas9 is a technology that allows scientists to essentially cut and paste DNA, raising hope of genetic fixes for disease. However, there are concerns about safety and ethics.
(Graphic explaining CRISPR gene editing technique, https://tmsnrt.rs/2ReKG1R)
The Chinese Society for Cell Biology in a statement on Tuesday strongly condemned any application of gene editing on human embryos for reproductive purposes and said that it was against the law and medical ethics of China.
More than 100 scientists, most in China, said in an open letter on Tuesday the use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to edit the genes of human embryos was dangerous and unjustified. ""Pandora's box has been opened,"" they said.
INFORMED CONSENT
He, who said he was against gene enhancement, said eight couples were initially enrolled for his study while one dropped out. The criteria required the father to be HIV positive and the mother to be HIV negative. 
Scientists at the conference pressed He to prove that those taking part in the trial were aware of all the risks involved in the process.
He said that all the participants had a ""good education background"" and went through two rounds of discussions with him and his team.
A 23-page English translation of an informed consent form for the potential mother said that the costs of the procedure covered by the team would be up to 280,000 yuan ($40,200) per couple.
The consent form mentions multiple risks, but there is little detail on potential complications of the gene-editing process itself, including for the child. It does not mention that such an experiment has never been done before.
David Baltimore, President Emeritus and the Robert Andrews Millikan Professor of Biology at the California Institute of Technology, spoke after He's speech, saying it was irresponsible to have proceeded until safety issues were in order. 
""I don't think it has been a transparent process. Only found out about it after it happened and the children were born,"" Baltimore said.
He Jiankui said his results could be used for millions of people with inherited diseases. He said he would monitor the two newborns for the next 18 years and hoped they would support continued monitoring thereafter. 
Shenzhen  Harmonicare Medical Holdings  Limited (HK:1509), named as being involved in He's project in China's clinical trial registry, sought to distance itself by stating the hospital never participated in any operations relating to the gene-edited babies and no related delivery had taken place.
In a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange on Tuesday, the group said preliminary investigations indicated the signatures on the application form circulated on the internet are ""suspected to have been forged, and no relevant meeting of the Medical Ethics Committee of the hospital in fact took place"".

The Guangdong province Health Commission announced on its website on Wednesday that it and Shenzhen city had set up a joint team to investigate the case.

428,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 07:36AM ET</span>",EU's climate chief calls for net-zero emissions by 2050,"By Alissa de Carbonnel
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's climate chief called for the bloc to take the lead and aim for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 in its climate strategy published on Wednesday, ahead of key U.N. talks on curbing global warming. 
As President Donald Trump pulls the United States out of the Paris climate accord, European Commission climate chief Miguel Arias Canete said the bloc had to lead by example at next week's climate talks in Poland. 
The EU executive published its strategy on Wednesday, setting out eight pathways to reducing emissions - two of which chart a course for Europe to becoming climate neutral by absorbing as much greenhouse gas as it emits.
""It's worth becoming the first major economy to fully decarbonise, to fully reach net zero emissions,"" Canete told Reuters on Tuesday. ""It will require lots of effort, but it is doable.""
Under a package of climate legislation adopted since the 2015 Paris Agreement on containing global warming, the EU is on track to overshoot its pledge to reduce emissions by 40 percent from 1990 levels by 2030.
New targets on energy saving, renewables and transport emissions have helped set the bloc on course to cut emissions by 45 percent by 2030 and 60 percent by 2050.
""That's okay, but we need to do more,"" Canete said, arguing that investment in clean energy would help grow the economy and save money on fossil fuel imports.
Upcoming U.N. talks are the most important since the Paris Agreement, with delegates from 195 nations set to haggle over the details of the pact, which Washington has said it will quit.
The 2015 pact aims to shift the world economy away from fossil fuels and limit the rise in global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius to avert more extreme weather, rising sea levels and the loss of plant and animal species.
By publishing its ambitious plan, EU officials hope to pull more weight at what are expected to be tough talks amid division among world powers.
""The role of the United States is less relevant and that puts more burden on our shoulders,"" Canete said. ""It will not be an easy conference, but the European Union arrives with lots of credibility.""
While Trump rejects projections that climate change will cause severe economic harm, a U.N. report detailing the dangers last month has spurred ministers from some EU nations to call for emissions to be cut at a faster rate than planned.
DIVISION WITHIN EU
However, European governments are also divided over how to strike a balance between climate policy and protecting high-employment sectors such as automakers and coal mining. Some, including economic powerhouse Germany, are struggling to meet their targets.
All of the pathways presented on Wednesday chart a rise in electricity consumption but some rely more heavily on storage while others more on alternative fuels like hydrogen.
In five scenarios the EU, responsible for some 10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, achieves reductions of about 85 percent by 2050 compared to 1990, Some sectors like agriculture still account for high emissions.
To achieve net negative emissions, the bloc will have to invest more in carbon capture and sustainable advanced biofuels but also encourage consumers to change their habits, the EU's modeling shows.

The European Commission hopes that the publication of its long-term strategy will inspire national governments to greater ambition when they draft their own plans by the end of 2019 for meeting the bloc's current climate goals.

Le Pen, who was a member of the European Parliament from 2009 until 2017, hired a bodyguard on a three-month contract as a local assistant at the end of 2011 with a monthly pre-tax salary of more than 9,000 euros ($10,155).
EU anti-fraud agency OLAF opened an investigation in 2014 into the payments and concluded that the European Parliament should recover that money. The parliament's secretary general said that a sum of 41,554 euros ($46,902) of EU funds had been wrongly paid in the period and needed to be reimbursed.
Le Pen challenged that decision at the General Court of the European Union, the EU's second highest court. She cited what she called factual errors, misuse of power, discrimination and OLAF's lack of independence. The court rejected her arguments on Wednesday, saying they lacked evidence or legal basis.
The General Court also upheld in June a parliamentary decision to recover 300,000 euros related to another person hired by Le Pen as a personal assistant.
She can still appeal the decision on points of law to the European Court of Justice, the EU’s top court.

The European Court of Justice (ECJ) held an urgent hearing in a case about whether Britain can revoke its notice to withdraw from the EU under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty without agreement of the other 27 states.
The ECJ said Advocate General Manuel Campos Sánchez-Bordona, whose advice is usually followed by judges, would deliver his decision on Dec. 4. 
That is the same day that the British parliament is due to begin a five-day debate on Prime Minister Theresa May's draft divorce bill before lawmakers vote on Dec. 11.
Britain is due to exit the EU on March 29, two years after London served notice in line with a June, 2016 vote to leave, but the fate of Brexit remains up in the air.
Many in May's Conservative Party as well as opposition lawmakers have said they will vote her deal down, raising the prospect of Britain leaving the bloc without any agreement.
The Scottish politicians behind the ECJ case hope that if the court rules in their favor, it would pave the way for a potential second referendum, giving voters the option to remain in the EU.
May has ruled out any second vote and the lawyer for the British government called on the ECJ not to get involved in domestic politics and to dismiss the case as hypothetical.
Both the European Commission and the Council of the European Union accepted that Article 50 could be revoked, but they argued that it could only be done with the unanimous permission of the remaining EU states. 

No date has yet been given for the decision of the Luxembourg justices although the court said it would come quickly. While the advocate general's opinion is non-binding, his advice is usually followed in the majority of cases.

GENEVA (Reuters) - U.N. war crimes investigators called on Syria on Wednesday to tell families what happened to their relatives who disappeared and provide the medical records and remains of those who died or were executed in custody.
No progress can be made towards a lasting peace to end the nearly eight-year-old war without justice, the International Commission of Inquiry on Syria said.
After years of government silence, Syrian authorities this year released ""thousands or tens of thousands"" of names of detainees alleged to have died, mostly between 2011 and 2014, it said in a report released before delivery to the U.N. Security Council.
""Most custodial deaths are thought to have occurred in places of detention run by Syrian intelligence or military agencies. The Commission has not documented any instance, however, where bodies or personal belongings of the deceased were returned,"" it said.
In nearly every case, death certificates for prisoners that were provided to families recorded the cause of death as a ""heart attack"" or ""stroke"", the independent panel led by Paulo Pinheiro said. 
""Some individuals from the same geographic area share common death dates, possibly indicating group executions,"" it said.
In most cases, the place of death was stated as Tishreen military hospital or Mujtahid hospital, both near Damascus, but the place of detention was not named, it said. 
""Pro-government forces and primarily the Syrian state should reveal publicly the fates of those detained, disappeared and/or missing without delay,"" the report said, noting this meant Syrian government forces, Russian forces and affiliated militia.
Families had the right to know the truth about their loved one's deaths and be able to retrieve their remains, it said.
In a 2016 report, the panel found that the scale of deaths in prisons indicated that the government of President Bashar al-Assad was responsible for ""extermination as a crime against humanity"".
In Syria, a family member must register a death within a month after receiving a death notification, the report said. Failure to do so results in a fine which grows after a year.
But given that there are millions of Syrian refugees abroad and internally displaced, many are not in a position to meet deadlines, it said.
The lack of an official death certificate may affect the housing, land and property rights of relatives, it said, noting that female-headed households may face further challenges to secure inheritance rights.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Global arms firms showed off on Wednesday their wares in Japan as it prepared a plan to buy billions of dollars of U.S. military equipment, including at least 40  Lockheed Martin  F-35 stealth fighters worth about $4 billion, four sources said.
The Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE:LMT) F-35s, which will replace 100 aging F-15 fighter jets, are in addition to an earlier order for 42 of the aircraft. 
The new procurement will leave Japan with about 100 stealth fighters, including some vertical take off B variants that could fly from helicopter carriers, in a bid to give it an edge over China in the contested East China Sea.
""It will be around 40 new aircraft,"" said one of the sources with knowledge of Japan's five-year plan.
He described a Tuesday report in the Nikkei business daily that Japan would buy as many as 100 new F-35s as ""aspirational"".
The procurement plan, which will be released in December with a paper outlining defense goals, is widely expected to accelerate defense spending increases that are already pushing Japan beyond a self-imposed limit of 1 percent of gross domestic product.
Despite having a pacifist constitution, even at 1 percent, Japan already ranks as one of the world's biggest military spenders. 
Japan is bolstering defenses against North Korean ballistic missiles with two Lockheed Martin Aegis Ashore air defense batteries.
It also wants to build a military equipped with modern fighter jets, longer range missiles and drones, as well as ships and aircraft to ferry soldiers to project power along an island chain stretching almost to Taiwan.
For the year starting on April 1, 2019, the Ministry of Defense is seeking a 2.1 percent increase in spending to 5.3 trillion yen ($46.54 billion) for the seventh straight annual increase.
Those outlays have drawn foreign defense contractors to this week's Japan International Aerospace Exhibition in Tokyo.
'LONGER OPERATIONS'
Limited space at the show, which is being held early to avoid a clash with the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, means that 300 fewer domestic companies are exhibiting compared with two years ago. 
But the number of foreign companies has gone up to 294 from 195.
""We see opportunities for more F-35s,"" said Andy Latham, head of business development for military aviation at BAE Systems (LON:BAES), which builds the fighter's rear fuselage. 
The British company also wants to partner with Japan on a new, longer-range fighter. They are together studying the development of beyond visual range air-launched missiles.
""That's indicative of the type of longer operations that Japan can become involved in,"" Latham said.
U.S. contractors may be the biggest winners of Japan's increased spending because purchases of their equipment will help Japan deflect criticism from President Donald Trump over a trade surplus he says hurts U.S. workers. 
Trump, who has threatened to put tariffs on Japanese cars, wants to make the United States even more dominant in the global weapons trade. 
U.S. overseas arms sales to foreign governments rose 13 percent to $192.3 billion in the year ending on Sept. 30, the State Department said this month.
Japan, which is bound to the United States by a treaty that obliges U.S. defense of Japan, is already one of their biggest and most profitable U.S. markets.
""It seems that there are a lot of requirements and evolving ones,"" said Kenneth Loving, the regional director of General Atomics Indo Pacific, as he stood next to a model of an Avenger drone.
Japanese military planners are interested in that General Atomic unmanned aircraft, one of the sources said, because in addition to patrolling Japanese waters, it could be used to target ballistic missiles aimed at Japan.

""We have formed the required bodies and mechanisms to pursue a peace agreement. We are now moving ahead into the next chapter of the peace process.""
Ghani said his chief of staff would lead the negotiating team, and there would also be an advisory board, comprising nine diverse and representative committees, to input into the negotiations.
""Presidential elections in the spring are key to successful peace negotiations. The Afghan people need an elected government with a mandate to obtain ratification, implement the peace agreement and lead the societal reconciliation process."" 
""Implementation will take a minimum of five years to reintegrate six million refugees and internally displaced people,"" he said. 
The key confidence building measures would need to happen early on, within the first year, he added.

A video of the blast scene broadcast by state media showed billowing black smoke and flames, while photographs showed rows of burnt-out cars and trucks.
An explosion during a delivery of acetylene set off a chain reaction among trucks parked along a road, leaving 50 vehicles damaged, the official Xinhua news agency reported, citing the city's fire fighting department.
The local government announced the casualty toll in a social media posting.
The acetylene was being delivered to the Haipoer New Energy Technology Company in Zhangjiakou city, in the northern province of Hebei, Xinhua reported. 
Reuters was unable to contact Haipoer for comment.
All fires at the blast site had been extinguished, state media reported.
Production at the nearby Hebei Shenghua Chemical Industry Co was operating normally, Xinhua reported. A woman who answered the plant's telephone had earlier told Reuters that production had been suspended.
Zhangjiakou, about 156 km (96 miles) northwest of Beijing, is set to host the 2022 Winter Olympics along with the capital.
Public anger over safety standards has grown in China after three decades of swift economic growth has been marred by accidents ranging from mining disasters to factory fires.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South and North Korea will launch a field study on Friday to relink railways cut since the 1950-53 Korean conflict, Seoul's Unification Ministry said on Wednesday, the latest development in improving ties between two sides technically still at war.
The announcement came after the U.N. Security Council granted sanctions exemptions last week following consultations between South Korea and the United States.
The survey would be a first step in an agreement to reconnect rail and road links reached by South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at their first summit in April. 
About 30 officials from each side are expected to take part in the 18-day study, which will include a 2,600-km (1,615-mile) train trip. They will inspect two routes in North Korea, between Kaesong and Sinuiju in the west and Mount Kumgang and the Tumen River in the east, which would ultimately be linked to the South, the ministry said. 
""After the joint survey, we will work on drawing up a basic framework for the project, additional research and design, and the actual construction would be conducted in line with progress on North Korea's denuclearization,"" the ministry said in a statement. 
U.S. officials have been concerned that inter-Korean relations may be advancing too fast even as Pyongyang and Washington struggle to make headway in denuclearization talks.
North and South Korea are technically still at war because the 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.
North Korea has for years pursued nuclear and missile programs in defiance of U.N. sanctions. But the two Koreas moved to defrost relations this year.

Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump pledged to work toward denuclearization at their landmark June summit in Singapore, but the agreement was short on specifics.

The ambassador even raised the possibility of sending German marines to the region.
Several senior European politicians have raised the possibility of new sanctions against Russia after the incident on Sunday, which the West fears could ignite a wider conflict near Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.
""Germany must take a clear line ... and put (Russian President Vladimir) Putin in his place,"" ambassador Andrij Melnyk told German radio on Wednesday. ""Everything is at stake."" 
""The club of sanctions should be wielded quickly .... There should be a complete ban on gas and oil imports from Russia, NordStream 2 must be put on ice,"" he said, adding only such measures could stop Putin's ""brutal, hoooligan-like"" behavior.
Ukraine is already nervous about the prospect of the NordStream 2 pipeline which increases Europe's reliance on Russian gas, fearing it will lose out on transit revenues.
""In military terms, what can you do? Sending German marines to the coast of Crimea ... could help stop an escalation. If you are there, Russians have fewer possibilities to act so brutally,"" he said.
""If you don't do anything, you can barely hope that this will come to an end,"" said Melnyk. 
So far, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called for de-escalation and dialogue. 
The foreign minister of Austria, which holds the EU's rotating presidency, has said any extension of sanctions imposed on Russia over its actions in Ukraine would depend on further information about the incident and how the two sides behave.

Russia opened fire on the Ukrainian boats, then seized them and their crews on Sunday. Moscow and Kiev have tried to pin blame on each other.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet on the sidelines of a G20 meeting this week, aiming to build on a thaw in ties after a military standoff on their disputed border last year, officials said.
The 3,500 km (2,200-mile) border between the nuclear-armed neighbors has been calm since Modi and Xi held several hours of talks in the Chinese city of Wuhan in April, agreeing to prevent political disputes escalating into confrontation.
Later this year, their two armies will hold joint exercises in a bid to build trust after their 73-day face-off in a remote, high-altitude stretch of the Himalayan border that stoked fears of war.
Modi's meeting with Xi at the G20 summit in Argentina will be their fourth this year, Indian Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale said.
""It was decided that they would take the opportunity whenever and wherever they could meet. They could discuss issues on either leader's mind or issues of mutual concern,"" Gokhale told reporters.
As well as long-standing disputes over their border, the two countries are vying for influence in the Indian Ocean and squabbling over Xi’s signature Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.
India has warmed up to the new government in the Maldives, offering financial help after it accused the previous government of striking secret deals with Chinese firms that have left the tiny country of 400,000 people in debt.
India and China are also aligned with opposing sides embroiled in political turmoil in Sri Lanka.
In Buenos Aires, the leaders of two of the world's fastest growing economies are expected to endorse efforts to liberalize their trade, Indian officials said. 
Negotiators from the two countries held talks in New Delhi on Wednesday to try to prise open each other's farm markets. 
China wants to export apples and dairy products and India is hoping to export skimmed milk products and buffalo meat, two Indian sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
India banned the import of Chinese apples in 2017 after finding pesticides, while China restricted imports of Indian buffalo meat because of concern over foot and mouth disease.
Chinese Vice Minister Hu Wei and Indian Commerce Secretary Anup Wadhawan are leading the talks on the farm products as part of a broader trade package
""India's primary interest is exporting skimmed milk products and for China it is apples,"" one of the officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the discussions.
Their bilateral trade reached $89.6 billion in 2017/18 with a deficit of $62.9 billion in China's favor. 

Indian officials said that China, locked in a trade dispute with the United States, has been more flexible than before with regard to the possible opening up of its markets to Indian pharmaceutical products and IT services.

Lu Guang, a three-time World Press Photo award winner, had been invited to take part in photography events in the regional capital, Urumqi, in late October, his wife, Xu Xiaoli, said in online posts.
She lost touch with her husband on Nov. 3 while he was travelling alone in the southern city of Kashgar and has not heard from him since, Xu said.
She later contacted the wife of the person who invited her husband to Xinjiang and was told both men had been taken away by state security officers, Xu said. 
The Xinjiang regional government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
At a regular news briefing in Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he was not aware of the case. 
""He went to Kashgar alone,"" Xu, who lives in New York City, told Reuters on Tuesday. ""Later, it was both him and the friend who were taken away.""
Lu's prize-winning work has largely focused on sensitive environmental and social issues in China, including industrial pollution, drug addiction and people living with AIDS.
Beijing has faced an outcry from activists, academics, foreign governments and U.N. rights experts over mass detentions and strict surveillance of the ethnic Uighur minority and other Muslim groups in Xinjiang.
Chinese authorities routinely deny any ethnic or religious repression in Xinjiang and say its measures are needed to combat the influence of religious extremism. 
Xu said she had not received any official notice of Lu's detention and had been unable to contact Xinjiang police.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Torrential rain and gale force winds lashed Australia's biggest city of Sydney on Wednesday causing commuter chaos, flooding streets, railway stations and homes, grounding flights and leaving hundreds of people without electricity.
Police called on motorists to stay off the roads. One person was killed in a car crash and two police officers seriously injured when a tree fell on them as they helped a stranded motorist.
Greg Transell, an office manager in Sydney's north told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that strong winds caused widespread disruption to the tower block office where he works.
""I started to go upstairs to see if there was any damage and next minute there was an almighty bang and it ripped panels off the roof in the warehouse,"" said Transell.
Australia's Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said within just a few hours Sydney got more than 100 mm of rain, a level that the country's most populous city would normally get through the whole of November.
""That’s the sort of rainfall you’d expect to see once every 100 years,"" said Ann Farrell, the bureau's state manager, told reporters.
Although the rains offered a welcomed respite to farmers who have suffered through a sustained drought in recent months, the weather caused major disruptions to Sydney's transport network.
Sydney Airport, the country's busiest, said 130 flights had been cancelled or delayed after it was forced to close two of its three runways.
""The storm is pretty intense in and around the airport,"" Cait Kyann, an airport spokeswoman, told Reuters. 
""We are operating from a single runway so that means that there are delays and likely some flights will be cancelled."" 
Ausgrid, the nation's biggest electricity network, said the storm had cut power to 8,100 customers in Sydney and the Central Coast area to its north.
By late afternoon, 1,700 homes and businesses remained without power, Ausgrid said.
There was chaos on Sydney's roads as the storm struck only hours before the main morning peak hour, transforming some streets into fast-flowing rivers and parks into lakes. Several stranded motorists were plucked from rising floodwaters.
""We are asking all road users to reconsider the need to be on the roads throughout what will be a severe rain event,"" said New South Wales state Assistant Police Commissioner Michael Corboy.
The BOM said the storms would last through most of the day before easing, with gale force winds whipping up four metre (12 feet) waves that would pound Sydney's beaches.
In contrast, in Australia's northern state of Queensland, soaring temperatures near 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) and strong winds exacerbated major bushfires.
Firefighters have been battling for nearly a week to contain more than 80 fires across Queensland.
""We are expecting a very bad day,"" Craig Crawford, fire and emergency services minister for the Queensland state government told Australian Broadcasting Corp radio.

""These are the kind of days where people could lose their lives.""

450,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 12:10AM ET</span>",Philippine leader slammed over threat to create 'Duterte death squad',"By Martin Petty
MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine leftists reacted with dismay on Wednesday to a threat by President Rodrigo Duterte to create a ""death squad"" to hunt what he said were Maoist assassins, a plan critics said could trigger a spree of killings similar to his bloody war on drugs.
Maoists, leftists and some lawmakers said Duterte would worsen an existing climate of fear and impunity by threatening to unleash his own hit men on those of the New People's Army (NPA), a communist militia that has waged a low-level insurgency in the Philippines for decades.
Duterte said his assassins would take out the NPA's ""sparrows"", who the communists deployed to kill police during the 1970s and 1980s rule of late strongman Ferdinand Marcos. It is not clear if the sparrows still exist.
""That is their advantage. So I am going to create my own sparrow, the 'Duterte Death Squad',"" he said in a speech on Tuesday.
Jose Maria Sison, the exiled founder of the Communist Party of the Philippines, denied the existence of ""sparrow"" assassins and said Duterte was using it as a pretext to kill suspected Maoist rebels.
Sison likened it to Duterte's anti-drugs campaign, during which thousands of people have been killed. Activists say many appear to have been executions, but police deny that and say all were shootouts with drug dealers.
""He gives himself the reason to form his own death squads,"" Sison told news channel ANC. ""Anyone suspected could be killed because police have the license to kill.""
Duterte's bellicose statements have alarmed rights groups, which say police are interpreting them as green lights to kill suspected criminals.
Duterte has been dogged by accusations that he ran a death squad when he was mayor of Davao City and oversaw a fierce crackdown on crime. He denies the allegations.
Leftist group Bayan said in a statement Duterte was ""inciting a killing spree against government critics, human rights defenders and just about everyone else tagged by the government as 'Red'"".
Senator Antonio Trillanes said Duterte was insecure about his hold on power.
""He wants to strike fear again into the hearts and minds of the Filipinos by forewarning that there would be another round of killings,"" Trillanes said.
""Fear is his only way to keep people in check.""
Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said Duterte's hit squad idea would be considered, but it would need clear operational guidelines and oversight.

""We will study it very closely,"" he told CNN Philippines. ""There is great danger of abuse or mistakes in these undercover operations.""

Bloomberg, citing a source familiar with the report's contents, on Wednesday reported it said the pilots were fighting an anti-stall system on their Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 MAX as they attempted to diagnose multiple apparent failures.
That is in line with information recovered from the flight data recorder that was released to Indonesia's parliament by the country's transport safety committee last week.
Bloomberg, citing its source, said the report stopped short of concluding what caused the crash but provided new data about the jet's maintenance, the airline's instructions for pilots, Boeing's flight manuals, the local weather and efforts to recover the wreckage.
Indonesia's National Transport Safety Committee (KNKT) head Soerjanto Tjahjono on Wednesday declined to comment to Reuters before the public release of the report.
KNKT held the meetings with families in Jakarta and Pangkal Pinang, a tin mining town that was the planned destination of the doomed flight that crashed into the Java Sea, the Indonesian official said.
A family member of one of the victims told local media the information provided was ""disappointing"", with much of it already in the public domain.

The Lion Air crash is the world's first involving the 737 MAX jet, a fuel-efficient version of Boeing's workhorse narrowbody that was first introduced into service globally last year.

452,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2018 09:10PM ET</span>",Illegal immigrants in U.S. at lowest level since 2004: study,"By Alex Dobuzinskis
(Reuters) - The population of unauthorized immigrants in the United States fell to 10.7 million in 2016, its lowest level since 2004, due largely to a decline in the number of people coming from Mexico, a study released on Tuesday said.
The report from the Pew Research Center https://pewrsr.ch/2Qptbid, based on U.S. Census data and other figures from 2016, showed the number of illegal immigrants in the United States has declined steadily since its peak of 12.2 million in 2007. 
Researchers believe part of the reason for the decline was the economic recession that gripped the United States in 2007 and the slow recovery that followed, which limited work opportunities for migrants. 
""The combination of economic forces and enforcement priorities may be working together to discourage people from arriving, or sending them home,"" said D'Vera Cohn, one of the authors of the Pew Research Center report. 
President Donald Trump has made immigration enforcement a focus for his administration, most recently pressing the U.S. Congress to authorize funding of a wall on the border with Mexico and deploying troops in advance of the arrival of a caravan of migrants from Central America. 
Even before Trump took office, a decline in the number of illegal immigrants from Mexico had changed the demographic profile of unauthorized migrants in the United States.
Mexico is still the country of origin for about half the unauthorized immigrants in the United States, but their number in that total population fell by 1.5 million between 2007 and 2016, the Pew report found.
During that decade, the number of unauthorized immigrants from Central America increased by 375,000.
VISA OVERSTAYS
With the share of Mexicans decreasing, Asians account for 22 percent of unauthorized immigrants who recently arrived in the United States, the report found.
Among recent arrivals, immigrants in the United States who overstayed a visa were likely to outnumber people who illegally crossed the border, it said.
Overall, the Pew study was in line with previous research that has found many unauthorized immigrants have been living in the United States for years and their children are more likely to have been born in the country than abroad. 
Among the 10.7 million unauthorized immigrants, two-thirds of adults have lived in the United States for more than a decade, the Pew Research Center study found. 

Five million U.S.-born children with American citizenship are living with parents or relatives who are unauthorized immigrants, the study found.

453,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2018 09:02PM ET</span>",The aging 'uncle' seeking to bring down Bangladesh PM Hasina,"By Zeba Siddiqui and Ruma Paul
DHAKA (Reuters) - An octogenarian former comrade of Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's father in the country's independence struggle is now the face of an embattled opposition seeking to end her decade-long rule increasingly tainted by accusations of authoritarianism.
In a general election due next month, Hasina's ruling Awami League will be fighting to retain power against a new alliance led by Kamal Hossain, an Oxford-educated international jurist who drafted the country's constitution – and whom Hasina grew up calling ""kaka"", or uncle.
The 82-year-old lawyer says his decision to forge an alliance with the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) was critical to restoring democracy in the country.
Hasina, the daughter of Bangladesh's independence hero Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, is the longest serving leader in its short history. She began a second straight term in power in 2014, after an election boycotted by the BNP and shunned by international observers, with more than half the seats uncontested.
""What has happened in the last five years is unprecedented,"" Hossain told Reuters in an interview. ""We have never had a government for five years that was unelected.""
Hasina and BNP chief Khaleda Zia share a long and bitter rivalry and have alternated in power for most of the past 28 years. But the BNP has been in disarray since Khaleda was jailed on corruption charges, which she denies, early this year.
The BNP's participation in the Dec. 30 election was in doubt until last month, when it and three other parties announced the formation of a new alliance, the Jatiya Oikya Front, or National Unity Front, helmed by Hossain, who runs a group called Gano Forum, or People's Forum.
Hossain walks with a stick, and says he is not seeking to become prime minister as he is too old. 
But some in the coalition, he said, privately compare him to Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister who took power aged 92 earlier this year, after defeating a predecessor mired in graft allegations.
""Maybe his health is better than mine,"" quipped Hossain.
""NOT A REBEL""
Hossain was born to a physician father under British rule in what is now Kolkata in eastern India. That was before the division into India and Pakistan, out of which Bangladesh was carved following a war in 1971.
He was jailed alongside Hasina's father, and later served him as the country's first law minister.
He went on to work in various roles at the United Nations after quitting the Awami League in the early 1990s to form the rival People's Forum.
BNP insiders say his international standing and image as a freedom fighter were reasons behind bringing him in to front the alliance.
Siding with the BNP, though, sets him up as a target for Hasina. The BNP has ties with the banned Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami, which opposed independence from Pakistan and several of whose members have been sentenced to death for committing war crimes.
Days after the new coalition was announced, Hasina declared that Hossain had ""joined hands with killers"".
""Yes, the BNP did a lot of things I never appreciate,"" said Hossain. ""They injected a degree of communalism into politics which is very regrettable.""
But he said the coalition would be secular and have nothing to do with groups such as Jamaat-e-Islami.
Some question whether he has the characteristics needed for the uglier side of Bangladeshi politics.
""He is not a rebellious leader, he is a classic constitutional lawyer,"" said Shahdeen Malik, a supreme court advocate and a professional acquaintance. ""Intuitively, he would do things by the book, and in our politics that can be a disadvantage – that to me is his main weakness."" 
""ONE-PERSON STATE""
Some political analysts predict a strong anti-incumbency sentiment in the election. 
Besides detaining scores of opposition members on charges the BNP terms fictitious, Hasina's government has also gone after critics such as prominent photographer Shahidul Alam, who was arrested for comments he made on social media. Hossain's daughter Sara is a well-known lawyer who helped secure Alam's bail last week.
Hasina has introduced laws that rights groups say give her sweeping powers to go after dissenters and gag the media.
Hossain called them a ""pre-planned effort"" to create ""not even a one-party state, but a one-person state"".
""The real danger of having an authoritarian government like the present one is, God forbid if it survives the next election, many of us will not be able to remain in the country,"" said Hossain in reference to his fears that critics will be targeted by the government. 
The Awami League has denied trying to curb free speech or media freedom, and called cases filed against BNP members legitimate. 
Previous elections have been marred by outbreaks of violence, ballot-stuffing and intimidation of voters, and Hossain said the alliance was planning to have several ""observers"" at polling booths and seeking international monitors. 
But even a loss will not completely dent his optimism. 

""I don't think a bad election will be long lasting,"" Hossain said. ""I believe those who are aspiring autocrats don't realize how deep the democracy commitment is in the blood of our people.""

454,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2018 07:17PM ET</span>",European politicians call for new sanctions on Russia over Ukraine,"By Andrew Osborn and Anton Zverev
MOSCOW/KERCH, Crimea (Reuters) - Several senior European politicians on Tuesday raised the possibility of new sanctions against Russia to punish it for capturing three Ukrainian vessels at sea, an incident the West fears could ignite a wider conflict.
A Russian minister said further sanctions would solve nothing and that the incident should not be used to derail the Minsk accord, which aims to end fighting in eastern Ukraine between Kiev's forces and pro-Russian separatist rebels.
Russian assets have come under pressure on financial markets amid concerns that possible new sanctions could hurt the economy, though the rouble on Tuesday clawed back some earlier losses as investors bet any sanctions would not be swift.
Russia opened fire on the Ukrainian boats and then seized them and their crews on Sunday near Crimea - which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Moscow and Kiev have tried to pin the blame on each other for the incident.
President Vladimir Putin told German Chancellor Angela Merkel by phone on Monday that Moscow was ready to provide more details to bolster its version of events. Moscow says Kiev deliberately provoked it in order to trigger a crisis.
Merkel, who also spoke on Monday with Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko, called for de-escalation and dialogue.
The United States urged European nations on Tuesday to do more to assist Ukraine in its standoff with Russia.
U.S. President Donald Trump told the Washington Post in an interview that he might cancel his scheduled meeting with Putin at the G20 summit in Argentina this week over the maritime clash, adding, ""I don't like that aggression.""
Ukraine has introduced martial law for 30 days in parts of the country it deems most vulnerable to an attack from Russia. It has said its ships did nothing wrong and that it wants the West to impose new sanctions on Moscow. 
Some of the 24 Ukrainian sailors held by Russia for straying into Russian waters appeared on Russian state TV on Tuesday admitting to being part of a pre-planned provocation. Kiev denounced what it described as forced confessions.
A court in Crimea ordered seven of the Ukrainian sailors to be detained for two months pending a possible trial. It was expected to order the other sailors to be detained for the same period in separate hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday. 
Their vessels were captured by Russian forces at sea near the Kerch Strait, which is the only outlet to the Sea of Azov and controls access to two major Ukrainian ports.
A Reuters reporter at the Crimean port of Kerch where the vessels are being held saw masked armed men on board one of the ships removing boxes of ammunition. 
Two Russian police officers with automatic rifles stood on the pier where the Ukrainian vessels were moored. The vessels bore traces of collisions and big holes in places.
NEW SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA?
Senior German conservative Norbert Roettgen, a close Merkel ally, said the European Union may need to toughen its sanctions against Russia, imposed partly over Moscow's annexation of Crimea.
Karin Kneissl, foreign minister of Austria, which holds the EU's rotating presidency, said the EU would consider sanctions depending ""on the exposition of facts and the further conduct of both parties"".
Poland and Estonia, both hawkish on Russia, expressed support for more sanctions. 
Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Bartosz Cichocki told Reuters the incident in the Kerch Strait vindicated Warsaw's call for a more unified Western stance toward Russia.
""Russia remains wrongly convinced that the reaction of the West isn't unified ... because in energy matters there is one stance and in defense matters there is another,"" he said, noting that some EU states such as Germany backed the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that increases Europe's reliance on Russian gas.
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert also raised Nord Stream 2 on Tuesday when asked to comment on the Ukraine-Russia spat, saying some European nations should review their support for a project that ""helps the Russian government"".
Nauert also said Europe could more vigorously implement existing sanctions against Russia over its actions in Ukraine.
""The United States government has taken a very strong position in ... support of Ukraine. We would like other countries to do more as well,"" she told a regular briefing in Washington.
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko, speaking during a visit to Berlin, said more sanctions against his country would ""not help to solve any problem at all"".
He suggested Kiev provoked the incident to derail already halting implementation of the Minsk accord in eastern Ukraine, and said Moscow had a keen interest in ending that conflict after absorbing more than a million refugees from the region.
EU foreign ministers are due to discuss the crisis on Dec. 10. EU leaders are expected later next month to agree to extend existing sanctions on Russia, diplomats said.
Russia's FSB security service released video footage on Tuesday of the captured sailors saying they had ignored Russian orders to stop. At least one appeared to be reading from a script. Ukrainian politicians said the sailors were coerced, rendering their confessions meaningless. 
The FSB said it had information showing the sailors' mission had been pre-planned by the Ukrainian government and that two intelligence officers from Ukraine's SBU security service had been on board to coordinate the provocation. 

Vasyl Hrytsak, the head of the SBU, confirmed that his officers were on board to support the military and said one of them had been seriously wounded after Russian aircraft fired missiles at the Ukrainian vessels.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - A British push for the U.N. Security Council to take action on Yemen's humanitarian crisis has slowed because several members, including the United States, are wary of impeding United Nations efforts to convene peace talks, diplomats said. 
The 15-member council continues to work on the draft resolution that would enshrine five requests made by U.N. aid chief Mark Lowcock - one of which was for a truce around facilities on which the aid operation and commercial importers rely - but is undecided on when it should be put it to a vote.
Some members want to wait until after planned peace talks have been held next month, said diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity. While no date has been announced for talks, U.N. Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths has said he aims to convene the parties before the end of the year in Sweden.
Western countries are pressing for a truce and renewed peace efforts to end the more than three-year conflict, which is seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
Yemen's economy is in crisis and three-quarters of its population, or 22 million people, require aid. Some 8.4 million are on the brink of starvation, although the United Nations has warned that will likely rise to 14 million.
In a note seen by Reuters, the United States signaled to council members on Tuesday that it was not ready to act on the draft resolution until after the talks had taken place. 
""We look forward to ongoing discussions throughout this critical period, and will continue to monitor closely both the situation on the ground, and progress towards the talks,"" the note said.
It added: ""We look forward to offering more substantive comments to the draft once we have more information on the outcomes of the upcoming consultations."" 
Britain circulated the draft text to council members a week ago, but did not give a timetable for a vote.
""Discussions on the resolution are ongoing and we will put it to a vote at the point that best delivers for the people of Yemen,"" said a spokesman for Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office. 
A Saudi-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Iran-allied Houthi group. The Houthis now rule most of Yemen's population, while the exiled government controls a section of the south.
Griffiths told the Security Council earlier this month that Yemen's parties had given ""firm assurances"" they were committed to attending peace talks.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China will retaliate ""in proportion"" if the United States sanctions its top official in the restive region of Xinjiang over alleged human rights abuses, China's ambassador to the United States said on Tuesday, adding that Beijing's policies in the region are to ""re-educate"" terrorists.
Chinese Ambassador to Washington Cui Tiankai told Reuters in an interview that China's efforts to combat international terrorism are held to a double standard, comparing Chinese actions in Xinjiang to U.S. troops battling Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
""Can you imagine (if) some American officials in charge of the fight against ISIS would be sanctioned?"" Cui said, adding ""if such actions are taken, we have to retaliate."" 
Cui did not elaborate on specific actions China might take. 
Beijing has faced an outcry from activists, academics, foreign governments and U.N. rights experts over mass detentions and strict surveillance of the mostly Muslim Uighur minority and other Muslim groups in Xinjiang. 
In August, a United Nations human rights panel said it had received many credible reports that a million or more Uighurs in China are being held in what resembles a ""massive internment camp that is shrouded in secrecy"". 
U.S. officials have said the Trump administration is considering sanctions targeting companies and officials linked to China's crackdown on minority Muslims, including Xinjiang Party Secretary Chen Quanguo, who, as a member of the powerful politburo, is in the upper echelons of China's leadership.   
Cui said that while the United States was using missiles and drones to kill terrorists, ""we are trying to re-educate most of them, trying to turn them into normal persons (who) can go back to normal life,"" Cui said.
""We'll see what will happen. We will do everything in proportion,"" he said, responding to a question on how China would retaliate to possible U.S. sanctions on Chen. 
Cui's comments are the strongest response yet to U.S. threats on the issue.
Any such U.S. sanctions decision against so senior an official as Chen would be a rare move on human rights grounds by the Trump administration, which is engaged in a trade war with China while also seeking Beijing's help to resolve a standoff over North Korea's nuclear weapons.
U.S. sanctions could be imposed under the Global Magnitsky Act, a federal law that allows the U.S. government to target human rights violators around the world with freezes on any U.S. assets, U.S. travel bans, and prohibitions on Americans doing business with them, U.S. officials have said.
Chinese authorities routinely deny any ethnic or religious repression in Xinjiang. They say strict security measures – likened by critics to near martial law conditions, with police checkpoints, the detention centers, and mass DNA collection – are needed to combat the influence of extremist groups.
After initial blanket denials of the detention facilities, officials have said that some citizens guilty of ""minor offences"" were sent to vocational centers to improve employment opportunities.
At a briefing in Washington on Monday, a Uighur woman, Mihrigul Tursun, 29, told reporters she had experienced physical and psychological torture, including electrocution while strapped to a chair, during 10 months in Xinjiang detention centers.
Tursun, who wept and shook as a translator read her prepared statement, said her three children were taken from her while she was in detention and that her four-month-old son had died without explanation in government custody. 
Rejecting Chinese government claims that the detention facilities serve vocational purposes, she said many of the dozens of other women in her cell were ""well-educated professionals, such as teachers and doctors.""
Tursun said she witnessed nine women die during one three-month period she spent in detention, including from sickness after being denied medical treatment.
Reuters could not independently verify her account, though numerous former detainees have begun to share similar first-hand details with media. China's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tursun's statement. 
Independent assessments of the conditions in Xinjiang are nearly impossible given restrictions on journalists from openly reporting from the region. 

U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet has called on China to allow monitors in Xinjiang, though Beijing has responded by telling her to respect China's sovereignty.

TBILISI (Reuters) - Ex-Soviet Georgia votes in a presidential election runoff on Wednesday that pits a candidate backed by the ruling party who favors a policy balancing ties with Moscow and the West against a rival who advocates a stronger pro-Western line.
If the opposition challenger Grigol Vashadze wins, he is likely to use the presidency's limited powers to push a vocal message of integration with the U.S.-led NATO alliance and the European Union -- sensitive issues in a country that fought a war in 2008 with its neighbor Russia.
The ruling party and its candidate in the vote, Salome Zurabishvili, take a more pragmatic line, balancing Georgia's aspirations to move closer to the West with a desire to avoid antagonizing the Kremlin.
Zurabishvili, a former French career diplomat and Georgia's foreign minister from 2004-2005 who is supported by the ruling Georgian Dream party, received 38.7 percent of the vote in the first round on Oct. 28.
That was just one percentage point ahead of Vashadze, who was a foreign minister in 2008-2012 in the resolutely pro-Western government that was in power when the conflict with Russia broke out over a Moscow-backed breakaway territory.
Constitutional changes have reduced the authority of the president, and put most levers of power in the hands of the prime minister, a Georgian Dream loyalist.
International observers said that the first round of voting had been competitive, but had been held on ""an unlevel playing field"" with state resources misused, private media biased, and some phony candidates taking part.
The first round result was a setback for Georgian Dream and its founder, billionaire banker Bidzina Ivanishvili. He is Georgia's richest man, and critics say he rules the country from behind the scenes.
Zurabishvili's supporters say she would bring international stature to the presidency. But her opponents have criticized her for statements that appeared to blame Georgia for war with Russia in 2008 and remarks about minorities that some see as xenophobic. 
Zurabishvili cut back her public meetings with voters and media appearances after the first round.
The opposition said there have been attacks on opposition activists during campaigning. One opposition coordinator was stabbed and a petrol bomb was thrown into the yard of another activist. 
The second round will be under close scrutiny, from opposition and international observers, for any sign the ruling party is using its control of the state machinery to help Zurabishvili win.

The ruling party has denied any link to attacks on opposition activists, and denied attempting to unfairly influence the outcome of the vote.

In an interview with the Washington Post, Trump said he was awaiting a ""full report"" from his national security team Tuesday evening about Russia’s capture of three Ukrainian naval ships and their crews on Sunday.
""That will be very determinative,"" Trump told the Post. ""Maybe I won't have the meeting. Maybe I won't even have the meeting ... I don't like that aggression. I don't want that aggression at all,"" he said.
Trump is due to meet Putin on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, which convenes on Friday and Saturday. The Trump-Putin meeting will cover security issues, arms control, and issues in the Middle East and Ukraine, White House national security John Bolton told reporters. 
Russia opened fire on the Ukrainian boats and then seized them and their crews on Sunday near Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Moscow and Kiev have tried to pin the blame on each other for the incident. 

The U.S. State Department urged European nations on Tuesday to do more to assist Ukraine in its standoff with Russia.

May is trying to drum up backing for the exit deal she has negotiated with Brussels in the hope of triggering a groundswell of support from businesses and citizens that will push lawmakers from across the political spectrum to drop their opposition.
""It is a deal that is good for Scottish employers and which will protect jobs,"" she will say, adding that the accord created a new free trade area defining an ""unprecedented economic relationship that no other major economy has."" 
""At the same time, we will be free to strike our own trade deals around the world – providing even greater opportunity to Scottish exporters.""
May needs to win a vote in parliament on Dec. 11 to approve her deal but that looks difficult with an apparent large majority of lawmakers - including the Scottish National Party which has 35 of Scotland's 59 seats in parliament - opposed to it.
The Brexit deal is likely to be a tough sell in Scotland, which voted 62 percent in favor of staying in the European Union at the 2016 referendum, and is concerned about diminished access to export markets, trading away fishing rights and the loss of the devolved decision-making powers it currently has.

The Scottish leg of her tour follows visits to Wales and Northern Ireland on Tuesday in which she met businesses, community and faith leaders, and local politicians, while lawmakers in London continued to criticize her deal.

Hassan Al Kontar got stuck in Kuala Lumpur International Airport in March when his Malaysian visa expired and he was not allowed to board a flight to another country.
He spent months in Terminal 2, living off airline meals, trying to find a country that would give him a visa, and documenting his travails to thousands of followers via Twitter and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
He showed himself knitting and celebrated when the sun peeked through the window or when, momentarily, a few fluorescent lights went off. 
""One day,"" he wrote in May, captioning a photo of himself looking out the window at a bank of waiting planes, ""it will just be a story.""
His plight caught the eye of Canadians who sought to privately sponsor him as a refugee.
""When we noticed he had this issue, he was stranded in the Malaysian airport and no place to go, nobody is accepting him, I offered, 'We have space. We can bring him in to sponsor him,'"" said Shawkat Hassan, with British Columbia's Muslim Association, which helped sponsor Al Kontar.
""So right away, some people responded and we started the procedure, we filled the paperwork and we sent it over,"" Hassan added.
The paperwork took months to process. Meanwhile, Al Kontar was taken into Malaysian immigration detention and threatened with deportation to Syria.
On Monday night, he arrived at Vancouver International Airport wearing flip-flops and was driven by Laurie Cooper, one of his sponsors, up the winding highway to Whistler, where he is staying.
""He's relieved,"" lawyer Andrew Brouwer told Reuters. ""He's exhausted but relieved.""

""I understand that Chairman Kim told (South Korean) President Moon (Jae-in) during their summit in September that if the U.S. took corresponding steps he would not only be willing to shut down the Yongbyon nuclear facilities but also allow verification,"" Yonhap quoted the source as saying.
The source said Moon passed the message on to U.S. President Donald Trump when the two met during the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September.
Kim had earlier expressed openness to shutting down the site if Washington took ""corresponding"" measures, but no offer to allow inspectors in to verify had been reported.
Asked about reports on Tuesday on North Korean willingness to allow inspectors in and whether there had been new developments, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said she was ""not aware of any of that,"" but Kim had agreed to inspections in a meeting with Pompeo recently.
""That's something the secretary and Chairman Kim had agreed to and spoken about when the secretary was in Pyongyang about a month ago or so,"" Nauert told reporters. ""So that's something they agreed to and we look forward to Chairman Kim fulfilling his commitments.""
It was not clear from her remarks whether Kim had specifically said inspectors could visit the Yongbyon facilities.

Mexico is battling to curb the flow of migrants from Central America fleeing violence and poverty, and tensions have risen on the U.S.-Mexico border since the arrival in the last few weeks of a caravan of mostly Hondurans seeking U.S. asylum.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has pledged to discourage migration through economic development, and wants the United States to contribute to a plan focused on Mexico's poorer south and Central America.
Speaking in Mexico City, Ebrard said the solution might not be similar to the Marshall Plan, ""but it will be in terms of the scale of the effort that needs to be made,"" he told reporters.
Named after U.S. general and later Secretary of State George Marshall, the Marshall Plan was a massive U.S.-backed effort to rebuild Western Europe after the devastation wrought by World War Two.
Ebrard, who is due to meet U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday to discuss the border and migration, said estimates were still being prepared to determine just how much funding would be needed to develop the region.
Mexico alone was likely to invest more than $20 billion in southern Mexico during the coming administration, Ebrard said.
""As a result, any serious effort undertaken for our brothers in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala would need to be a similar sum,"" he added.
The bulk of illegal immigrants caught trying to enter the United States in recent years have set out from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, three of the most violent and impoverished countries in the Americas.
U.S. President Donald Trump has been pressuring Mexico to keep the migrants while their asylum claims are processed in the United States. Members of the incoming government have suggested some sort of deal may be possible.
Ebrard said Mexico was not thinking of deporting the Central American migrants currently stuck on the U.S. border.

""What's to be done? Get ready to assume that some of them are going to be on Mexican soil and in that area during the next few months,"" he said.

The U.S. Treasury said in a statement it had employed Trump's new executive order to punish Nicaraguan Vice President Rosario Murillo, Ortega's wife, and an aide it named as Nestor Moncada Lau, accusing them of undermining Nicaragua's democracy.
The step will have the effect of freezing any property owned by Murillo and Moncada that falls under U.S. jurisdiction and of barring U.S. individuals, banks and other entities from carrying out any transactions with them.
More than 300 people have been killed and at least 2,000 injured in crackdowns by police and armed groups on protests that began in April over government plans to cut welfare benefits and then escalated into broader opposition to Ortega.

""The Ortega regime's systematic dismantling and undermining of democratic institutions and the rule of law, its use of indiscriminate violence and repressive tactics against civilians as well as its corruption leading to the destabilization of Nicaragua's economy, constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat,"" Trump said in the executive order.

(Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors on Tuesday claimed that a lawyer for Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, who is currently on trial in Brooklyn federal court, helped arrange unauthorized contact between the accused Mexican drug lord and his wife, Emma Coronel.
In a motion filed before 2 a.m. EST, the prosecutors asked U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan to impose sanctions on Guzman's defense team. Much of the motion, including the nature of the sanctions sought, was redacted, and the lawyer accused of arranging the contact was not publicly identified.
Jeffrey Lichtman, one of Guzman's lawyers, called the claim ""pure speculation.""
Guzman, 61, faces 17 criminal counts and a possible sentence of life in prison. He has been subject to exceptionally tight security protocols, known as special administrative measures or SAMs, thanks to his two escapes from high-security Mexican prisons and what prosecutors have described as a history of intimidating witnesses.
Prosecutors said in Tuesday's motion that some people, whose names were redacted, ""appear to have used cellular telephones in concert with an attorney visit to the defendant following two trial days last week to facilitate unauthorized and, under the SAMs, impermissible contact between the defendant and Ms. Coronel.""
Security is so stringent that Guzman was not even allowed a brief hug with Coronel at the outset of the trial.
Cogan said on Monday that Coronel had been seen using a cell phone in the courthouse, which is not allowed under court rules. In a private sidebar conference that afternoon, one of Guzman's lawyers told the judge that Coronel had been using Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Translate on a cell phone last week to understand the proceedings, because the headset she normally used to listen to an interpreter was not working.
Cogan accepted what he called the ""innocuous explanation,"" and prosecutors did not raise any further concerns, according to a transcript of the conference.
However, prosecutors said in Tuesday's motion that their new claims were based on a review of footage from multiple courthouse surveillance cameras. Details about what that footage showed were redacted.
In the trial, expected to last up to four months, prosecutors are seeking to prove that Guzman sent massive shipments of cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine into the United States as leader of Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel.

Guzman's lawyers have said they would prove their client was framed by another drug lord, Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada, and the government officials he had allegedly bribed.

467,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2018 02:45PM ET</span>",Pentagon tells Russia not to tamper with alleged Aleppo attack site,"By Idrees Ali
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon cautioned Russia on Tuesday not to tamper with the site of an alleged gas attack in Syria's Aleppo and allow investigators to inspect the site.
The global chemical weapons agency, know as the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), has said it will investigate the alleged gas attack in Aleppo on Saturday that reportedly sickened up to 100 people. The Syrian government and its ally, Russia, blamed the attack on insurgents.
The Syrian government, which accused rebels of firing chlorine, asked the OPCW to send a fact-finding mission to the city.
""We caution Russia against tampering with another suspected chemical weapons attack site and urge Russia to secure the safety of the OPCW inspectors so these allegations can be investigated in a fair and transparent manner,"" Pentagon spokesman Commander Sean Robertson said.
In April, the United States accused Russia of blocking international inspectors from reaching the site of a suspected poison gas attack in Syria's Douma and said Russians or Syrians may have tampered with evidence on the ground.
The OPCW will be able not only to determine whether a chemical weapons attack occurred but also to assign blame. That responsibility had fallen to a joint U.N.-OPCW mission until Russia blocked a United Nations Security Council resolution to extend its mandate a year ago.
Past investigations by the joint mission found that Syrian government forces had used chlorine and sarin several times in the civil war, while the Islamist militant group Islamic State was found to have used sulfur mustard gas once. Other rebel groups have not been found in formal reports to have used banned toxic munitions.
A health official in Aleppo said victims had suffered breathing difficulties, eye inflammation and other symptoms that suggested the use of chlorine gas.
Chlorine is a widely available industrial chemical, but its use as a weapon is banned internationally.
The Pentagon also called on the Syrian government not to use ""false pretexts"" to carry out strikes in Idlib's de-escalation zone. 
""We continue to engage the Russian government and military at senior levels to make clear that an offensive in Idlib would represent a reckless escalation of the conflict,"" Robertson said.
Russia's defense ministry said on Sunday its warplanes bombed militants in the insurgent stronghold of Idlib who it accused of firing poison gas at Aleppo.

A Russian-Turkish deal in September for a demilitarized zone staved off an army offensive against the Idlib region.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States has spoken with Israel about possibly presenting a long-awaited Middle East peace plan at the start of next year, which could avoid interfering with the country's election, Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon said on Tuesday. 
U.S. President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner has been preparing a plan for peace between the Palestinians and Israel. But the Palestinians are skeptical and have accused the Trump administration of siding with Israel on the core issues relating to the decades-old conflict, burying all chances for peace.
""We don't know the details of the plan but we know that it's completed. So now the question is when will they submit it. As far as we know they speak with us about the beginning of '19,"" Danon told reporters. 
At the annual United Nations gathering of world leaders in September, Trump said in a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu he wanted to unveil a peace plan over the next two to three months.
""We always spoke about the fact that maybe we are going to elections in Israel and the issue was whether you present the plan in the middle of a campaign. As it looks now we are going for elections but not immediately,"" Danon said on Tuesday. 
""So basically today the president is able to come and present it without interfering in a political debate in Israel,"" he said. ""If you present it during an election it will be horrendous.""
The next national election in Israel is scheduled for November 2019, but politicians and political analysts have speculated the poll could be brought forward to March or May after Netanyahu's governing coalition was reduced to a one-seat majority in parliament earlier this month.
U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman said in a statement on Monday it would be shared ""at the appropriate time,"" adding that: ""Our timing, our strategy and our messaging is and will be entirely our own.""
Danon said it was unclear if the United States planned to present a ""take it or leave it"" plan or if it would try and bring all sides together to negotiate the proposal. 
Trump's Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt, who is working on the plan with Kushner, made clear in September that both sides could expect parts they would like or dislike.

The Palestinians have refused to participate in the U.S. effort since December when Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital and then moved the U.S. embassy there.

The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said on Tuesday the latest trial brought to nine the total number of convictions landed - which include one for FH Bertling Ltd itself - in a four-year investigation into corrupt schemes in the North Sea and Angola.
Reporting restrictions were lifted on Tuesday after a London jury acquitted three and convicted one in a case linked to a 16 million pound-plus ($20 million) freight forwarding contract related to a North Sea project called Jasmine.
FH Bertling executives paid more than 350,000 pounds in bribes to sweeten a bid for the Jasmine contract - and to ensure that inflated prices charged for additional services were waived through, the SFO said.
Former FH Bertling executives Stephen Emler and Giuseppe Morreale pleaded guilty to being part of a corrupt scheme to secure the contract.
Former logistics project lead Christopher Lane pleaded guilty to a separate bribery scheme involving overcharging and Colin Bagwell, another FH Bertling manager, was convicted by the jury of the same offence. 
The men will be sentenced on Dec. 11.
The latest convictions come on top of seven others for bribing an agent of Sonangol, the Angolan state oil group, last year. Two individuals were charged over both schemes.
""These senior executives failed to show any integrity, resorting to bribery to secure lucrative contracts and hide their illicit activities,"" said SFO head Lisa Osofsky. 
""It is our mission to bring criminals like these to justice. Bribery has no place in business in Britain or abroad. It undermines the rule of law, distorts our economy and damages the reputation of the UK.""

Alejandro Andrade, who ran the treasury for four years under late socialist leader Hugo Chavez, must surrender to prison by Feb. 25, according to an order by U.S. District Judge Robin Rosenberg in West Palm Beach, Florida. The 120-month sentence was the maximum prison term he faced. 
The cases are part of a broad effort by U.S. prosecutors to crack down on the use of the U.S. financial system to launder proceeds from rampant corruption in Venezuela, which has hyperinflation.
Neither Andrade's lawyers nor Venezuela's information ministry immediately responded to requests for comment. 
In December 2017, Andrade secretly plead guilty to one count of conspiring to commit money laundering. The plea was unsealed last week. 
According to the U.S. Justice Department, he admitted during his plea to accepting over $1 billion in bribes in exchange for using his position to help a billionaire TV mogul and others conduct currency exchange transactions at favorable rates for the government. 
Since 2003, the exchange control system has sold heavily subsidized dollars through state currency agencies or government auctions. But dollars on the black market have fetched at least double and sometimes 10 times more, allowing the well-connected to buy cut-rate dollars and resell them at a huge profit.
Andrade received bribes from brokerages to sell dollar-denominated bonds on behalf of the government, according to court records. The brokerages kept part of the proceeds and returned kickbacks to him by buying him items including 17 horses, 35 luxury watches, 12 cars and six South Florida homes. 
President Nicolas Maduro has said little about criminal proceedings against former Venezuelan officials, but says the United States is seeking to undermine his government through financial sanctions.

473,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2018 12:31PM ET</span>",Hundreds of Tunisians protest at visit of Saudi prince,"By Tarek Amara and Ulf Laessing
TUNIS (Reuters) - Hundreds of Tunisians staged the first protests of the Arab world against Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince as he arrived on a visit on Tuesday, denouncing him as a murderer involved in the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
The protests were a rare occurrence for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's de facto ruler who faces no overt criticism at home and who received a lavish reception earlier in his tour in visits to Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.
Since the 2011 ""Arab spring"" uprising, which unseated entrenched rulers in the region and triggered turmoil, Tunisia has undergone a democratic transition and is one of the few Arab countries to allow protests.
Hundreds of protesters marched through the central Habib Bourguiba avenue in Tunis, scene of the mass protests that toppled the country's Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in 2011, on the second day of demonstrations against the Saudi prince.
They chanted ""the murderer is not welcome in Tunisia"" and ""Shame on Tunisia's rulers"" for receiving bin Salman.
The killing of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and a critic of the crown prince, at Riyadh's consulate in Istanbul six weeks ago has strained Saudi Arabia's ties with the West and battered Prince Mohammed's image abroad.
Saudi Arabia has said the prince, heir to the throne of the world's top oil exporter, had no prior knowledge of the murder.
After offering numerous contradictory explanations, Riyadh said last month that Khashoggi had been killed and his body dismembered when negotiations to persuade him to return to Saudi Arabia failed.
The prince was welcomed by Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi when he arrived at the airport in Tunis from Cairo, the presidency said, and he left immediately for talks with Essebsi at Carthage Palace, the presidential seat.
Protesters raised a large poster which depicted the Tunisian president pouring water on the bloodied hands of the Saudi crown prince - suggesting Tunisia's complicity in washing away guilt.
Protesters also called for an end to the Saudi-led military campaign in neighbouring Yemen, which was launched by Prince Mohammed in his role as defence minister in 2015.
The protests were in sharp contrast with earlier parts of his tour of allied countries in the region.
Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi underscored the strength of ties between the two countries, and called Saudia Arabia's security and stability ""an inseparable part of Egypt's national security.""
TIES SOMETIMES STRAINED
Journalists on Monday put up a huge banner at their union showing the prince with a chainsaw, which Turkish sources have said was used to dismember Khashoggi in Istanbul. It read: ""No to the pollution of the Tunisian revolution.""
In an apparent attempt to avoid embarrassing the prince, the presidency only invited photographers to cover his visit. It will not hold a news conference, a usual event at top visits.
Last week Nourredine Ben Ticha, adviser to Essebsi, said the truth about the killing of the Saudi journalist needed to be established but the incident should not be used to harm the kingdom's stability.
Tunisia and Saudi Arabia are very different political systems. The kingdom is an absolute monarchy while Tunisia has been holding free elections since 2011 and agreed three years later on a constitution guaranteeing fundamental rights.
Tunisia was a strong Saudi ally under Ben Ali but ties have since been strained at times. The kingdom granted exile to Ben Ali who flew to Jeddah on the Red Sea after his ousting, resisting calls by some Tunisian parties to hand him over.
Another irritant is that moderate Islamists have been sharing power with secularists in Tunisia since 2011. Some critics have likened the Tunisian Ennahda party to the Muslim Brotherhood, which is banned in Saudi Arabia.
In contrast, Tunisia has since 2011 expanded cooperation with Qatar, with which Saudi Arabia and three other Arab states severed trade and transport ties in June 2017. The four accused Doha of supporting terrorism and Iran — charges Doha denies.
Tunisia also has strong ties with Turkey, whose relations with Saudi Arabia have been strained by the Khashoggi killing.

The prince is expected to fly on to a G20 summit in Argentina at the end of his Tunisia visit.

Ali Akbar Salehi, head of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, said the Islamic Republic could resume enriching uranium to 20 percent purity - seen as well above the level suitable for fuelling civilian power plants - if it fails to see the economic benefit of the 2015 deal that curbed its nuclear program.
""If we cannot sell our oil and we don't enjoy financial transactions, then I don't think keeping the deal will benefit us anymore,"" Salehi told Reuters ahead of a meeting with EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini in Brussels.
""I will pass certainly a word of caution to her (Mogherini): I think the period of patience for our people is getting more limited and limited. We are running out of the assumed timeline, which was in terms of months.""
Following the meeting, Mogherini said she and Salehi remained committed to safeguarding the nuclear accord.
""They equally expressed their determination to preserve the nuclear agreement as a matter of respecting international agreements and a key pillar for European and regional security,"" Mogherini's office said in a statement.
It said Mogherini also repeated the EU stance ""on issues of concern such as Iran's role in the region"" - alluding to Iranian involvement in Middle East conflicts from Yemen to Syria.
Under the 2015 deal with world powers, Iran restricted its enrichment program, widely seen in the West as a disguised effort to develop the means to make atomic bombs, in exchange for an end to international sanctions.
U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of the accord in May, arguing it was weak because it did not halt Iran's development of ballistic missiles or support for armed proxies abroad, and reimposed sanctions on Iran's vital oil export sector earlier this month.
But Europe sees the nuclear deal as an important element of international security.
The EU and other remaining parties - China and Russia - have struggled to preserve trade incentives for Iran to respect the deal's nuclear limits under U.S. pressure.
ENRICHED URANIUM 
In Brussels for talks on civilian nuclear cooperation that EU officials intended as a signal support for the accord, Salehi said the bloc's efforts were encouraging but added: ""We have not yet seen any tangible results.""
He welcomed an EU plan to establish a special financial vehicle for non-dollar trade with Iran but only if it could preserve Iranian oil exports - Tehran's economic lifeline.
""It (the SPV) could be helpful in keeping the deal alive,"" he said. ""If there is nothing to reap, then what is the purpose of us staying in because voices in Iran are day by day becoming more against the deal.""
Iran's oil exports are expected to drop sharply to about 1 million bpd in November from a peak of 2.8 million bpd earlier this year. However, output is expected to recover somewhat from December thanks to U.S. waivers, including for two EU nations - Greece and Italy.
Under the 2015 deal, Iran stopped producing 20 percent enriched uranium and gave up the majority of its stockpile. Salehi reiterated warnings that Iran has the technical capacity to ramp up enrichment if the deal unravels.
""It is very easy for us to go back to what we were before - even to a better position. We can start the 20 percent enrichment activity. We can increase the amount of enriched uranium.""

Uranium refined to 20 percent fissile purity is well beyond the 5 percent normally required to run civilian nuclear power stations, though still well short of highly enriched, or 80 to 90 percent, purity needed for a nuclear bomb.

(Reuters) - Voters in Mississippi on Tuesday will decide a U.S. Senate special election runoff marked by racial controversy and capped by a last-minute visit by President Donald Trump to shore up the beleaguered Republican incumbent.
Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith, a white former state lawmaker who was appointed to the seat in April, is still favored over black Democrat Mike Espy in the reliably Republican state, which has not sent a Democrat to the U.S. Senate since 1982.
But she has been engulfed in a political storm since a video surfaced showing her praising a supporter at a Nov. 2 public event by saying: ""If he invited me to a public hanging, I'd be on the front row.""
The comment caused an uproar in Mississippi, a deep South state with a history of racism and violence against blacks, including lynchings. Several businesses, including giant retailer Walmart (NYSE:WMT), demanded that she return their donations.
Hyde-Smith was also shown on another video joking about suppressing liberal student votes, and photographs have surfaced of her posing with Confederate artifacts in 2014.
Espy, a former congressman and U.S. agriculture secretary, gained new momentum from the furor in a state where 38 percent of residents are African-American. 
""She is still the front-runner, but she is a wounded front-runner. She's not the sure thing she was a few weeks ago,"" said Nathan Shrader, a political science professor at Millsaps College in Jackson, the state's biggest city.
Hyde-Smith, who initially refused to apologize for the hanging remark, said last week she was sorry ""for anyone that was offended"" and accused Espy of twisting her words for political gain.
Espy denied the charge and said ""we all know what came out of your mouth."" He has said the comment perpetuated negative stereotypes about Mississippi and hurt investment.
Hyde-Smith, 59, has touted her support for Trump and her endorsement by the president, who won Mississippi by 18 percentage points in 2016. Trump held two get-out-the-vote rallies in the state on the eve of the election.
""Got to get out and vote, don't take any chances,"" he told supporters in Tupelo. ""Your vote on Tuesday will decide whether we build on our extraordinary achievements or whether we empower the radical Democrats to obstruct our progress.""
The runoff to serve the last two years of former Republican Senator Thad Cochran's term was necessary because neither Espy nor Hyde-Smith gained more than 50 percent of the vote in a Nov. 6 special election with four candidates. Cochran, 80, resigned earlier this year, citing health concerns.
The last contest of the midterm election cycle, Tuesday's election will not affect the balance of power in the new Congress that sits in January. Republicans will still hold a Senate majority even if Hyde-Smith loses, while Democrats will take control of the House of Representatives.
A lack of public polling has contributed to uncertainty about the race. 
Mississippi Democrats hope to recreate the coalition that propelled Democrat Doug Jones to a Senate victory in neighboring Alabama last year by energizing black voters, particularly women, and winning support from white swing voters.
Espy, 64, has campaigned as a moderate who would work with Trump and Republicans to benefit the state. Shrader said Espy had done a good job of walking the fine line of appealing to Republicans while still generating enthusiasm among Democrats.

""Hyde-Smith is relying on her Republican affiliation and her loyalty to Trump - and that might be enough,"" he said.

The accused include Julius Ayuk Tabe, the leader of an Anglophone separatist movement in western Cameroon fighting to break away from the Francophone-dominated central government.
Hundreds of people, including civilians, separatist fighters and Cameroonian security agents, have been killed in the past year's violence, which has emerged as the most serious security threat to President Paul Biya, in power for 36 years. 
""Ten charges have been brought against them, including terrorism, advocating terrorism, secession, civil war and revolution,"" lawyer Christopher Ndong told Reuters after the charges were read out at the capital Yaounde's military court.
The trial is scheduled to begin on Dec. 6, Ndong added. 
Tabe and his co-defendants were among 47 Anglophone Cameroonians arrested in Nigeria and deported to Cameroon in January. The remaining 37 suspects are still being held by the authorities and have not been charged, said Ndong.
Cameroon's government spokesman was not immediately available for comment.
A separatist insurgency gained pace in 2017 following a government crackdown on peaceful protests by Anglophones, who complain of being marginalized by the French-speaking majority.
Violence from both sides of the conflict intensified this year, forcing thousands of civilians to seek refuge in Francophone regions.
Biya, re-elected to a seventh term in October, said in his inauguration speech last month the separatists must lay down their arms or face the full force of the law.
Cameroon regularly sentences people to death but has not carried out an execution in years.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Tanzanian President John Magufuli, who has faced threats in recent weeks from Western donors to cut off aid in response to human rights concerns, said on Tuesday he prefers assistance from China, as Beijing imposes fewer conditions.
""The thing that makes you happy about their aid is that it is not tied to any conditions. When they decide to give you (assistance), they just give you,"" Magufuli said, according to a statement posted on State House's website.
He delivered the comments at the launch of a new library at the University of Dar es Salaam built at a cost of 93.6 billion Tanzanian shillings ($40.61 million) with the help of the Chinese government, the president's office said. 
In recent weeks, Western donors have increasingly put pressure on Tanzania over what they say is the declining human rights situation there. 
Earlier this month, Denmark froze funding to Tanzania, saying it was withholding $10 million worth of aid money over concerns about policies that threaten gay people.
The European Union has also launched a comprehensive review of its policies towards Tanzania over concerns about rights abuses. The EU announced the decision saying that government pressure had led to the “forced departure” of its ambassador.
Meanwhile, the World Bank put a planned $300 million loan for an education project on hold, partly in response to a law preventing pregnant girls from returning to school.
The lender later said a cautious agreement had been reached to get the loan process back on track after Tanzania agreed to reconsider the legislation.
Magufuli said on Tuesday his government will continue to develop and cultivate its good relationship with China. 
""They have helped us in a lot of other areas of development,"" he said.
China has dramatically increased its involvement in Africa in the past decade, funding major infrastructure projects across the continent. Beijing's critics say its projects have pushed some African countries too deeply into debt.

KABUL (Reuters) - A roadside bomb blast killed three U.S. service members and wounded three others near the central Afghan city of Ghazni on Tuesday, the NATO-led Resolute Support mission said.
Taliban insurgents, who control large parts of Ghazni province, claimed responsibility for the attack, which also wounded an American civilian contractor.
A Taliban commander in Ghazni said U.S. and Afghan security forces were conducting raids in different areas of Ghazni and insurgents managed to plant a powerful improvised explosive device (IED) in the Shahbaz area targeting one of their armored vehicles.
""The U.S. and Afghan forces are desperately trying to recapture some of the important places in Ghazni and have conducted several raids but they couldn't succeed and have suffered losses,"" the commander said.
The NATO statement gave no details but Mohammad Arif Noori, a spokesman for the provincial governor, said an armored vehicle carrying U.S. troops hit a large roadside bomb in the Shahbaz area, just outside the city, on Tuesday morning.
He said U.S. special forces had been conducting operations with Afghan forces around Ghazni city since Monday.
The casualties were the latest in a growing toll on U.S. forces in Afghanistan and followed the death of an army Ranger during an operation against al Qaeda militants in Nimruz province on Saturday. Resolute Support said the soldier had been accidentally shot by a member of Afghan partner forces.
At least 11 U.S. service members have now died in Afghanistan this year, in combat or in so-called ""insider attacks"" by Afghan soldiers or police. Four Czech soldiers, serving with Resolute Support, have also been killed.
There was no official confirmation from U.S. or NATO forces of the circumstances of Tuesday's blast but Ghazni has been one of the most embattled regions of Afghanistan this year and many areas close to the city are in the hands of the Taliban.
The city, which sits on the main highway linking the capital Kabul with Kandahar in the south, was overrun this year by a large Taliban force before it was driven off by Afghan and U.S. troops after days of heavy fighting. 
About 14,000 U.S. troops remain in Afghanistan as part of Resolute Support and a separate counter-terrorism mission aimed against militant groups such as al Qaeda and Islamic State.

480,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2018 10:30AM ET</span>",U.N. reaffirms refugees' right to seek asylum in U.S.,"By Stephanie Nebehay
GENEVA (Reuters) - Asylum seekers at the Mexican border fleeing violence or persecution are entitled to lodge claims in the United States to obtain sanctuary there, U.N. agencies said in a fresh attempt to shield migrants from tough U.S. immigration policies.
United Nations officials have repeatedly urged Washington to ensure asylum seekers are protected, but U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday Mexico should send migrants seeking asylum in the United States back to their home countries.
U.S. authorities fired tear gas canisters toward migrants in Mexico - near the border crossing separating Tijuana from San Diego, California - on Sunday when some rushed through border fencing into the United States. Mexico's foreign ministry presented a diplomatic note to the U.S. government on Monday calling for a ""full investigation"".
After Trump signed an order limiting asylum rights earlier this month, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said the United States must make sure anyone fleeing violence or persecution can get protection ""without obstruction"".
UNHCR spokesman Babar Baloch, asked on Tuesday about U.S. forces firing tear gas at migrants, told a Geneva news briefing:
""We are following those reports with concern, we are still trying to understand what transpired there.""
Border management is ""a sovereign prerogative of national governments"", but border security and international protection for refugees are not mutually exclusive, he said.
""It means that any person whose life is at risk in their country of origin must be able to access territory and request asylum in a safe country. And each asylum request should be considered individually.
""We have been repeating our call on the U.S. authorities to grant access to the territory and to asylum procedure to those who are fleeing persecution and violence,"" he said.
Sunday's incident was the latest chapter in a saga that has pitted Trump's hardline immigration policies against thousands of migrants who have made their way north through Mexico from violent and impoverished Central American countries.
Some 3,500 migrants from the caravans have applied for asylum in Mexico, Baloch said. 
Seven migrants have died in incidents along the way, Joel Millman of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said.

""We believe governments have the right to defend their borders and should do so responsibly,"" he said. ""We also think migrants certainly should have the expectation that there be an access that is legal and safe for them to at least seek to cross a border.""

481,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2018 10:19AM ET</span>",Greenhouse gas emissions gap wider than ever: U.N. report,"By Bate Felix
PARIS (Reuters) - Global greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 could be between 13 billion and 15 billion tonnes more than the level needed to keep global warming within 2 degrees Celsius this century, a United Nations report estimated on Tuesday.
The ninth annual U.N. Environment Programme (UNEP) report analyzed the impact of countries' emissions cut targets and policies, and whether they are enough to limit global average temperature rise to a safer threshold below 2C.
The assessment comes a few days before a U.N. climate conference starts in Poland from Dec. 2-14. The talks will produce a ""rule book"" on how to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement which aims limit the rise in global temperatures to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius.
UNEP said annual greenhouse gas emissions reached a record high of 53.5 billion tonnes in 2017 after three years of decreases. They are not seen peaking by 2030, let alone by 2020.
However, emissions in 2030 will need to be around 25 percent and 55 percent lower than last year to put the world on track to limit global warming to 2 degrees and 1.5 degrees Celsius respectively, the report said.
""Increased emissions and lagging action means the gap figure for this year's report is larger than ever,"" the report said.
Current climate policies are seen lowering emissions by up to 6 billion tonnes by 2030, implying global warming of around 3C by 2100, with warming continuing afterwards.
""If the emissions gap is not closed by 2030, it is very plausible that the goal of a well below 2C temperature rise increase is also out of reach,"" the report said.
To keep warming below 2C, countries must triple their current efforts. For the more ambitious target of 1.5C, countries must raise ambitions by five times.
Currently, the world's 20 biggest economies, the G20, are collectively not on track to meet their 2030 pledges, UNEP said.
Analysis and review of progress against pledges from countries to reduce their emissions under the Paris Agreement, so-called Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), showed they were insufficient.
Added impetus came last month in a report by the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which said that keeping the Earth's temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius would require rapid and unprecedented changes.
""If the IPCC report represented a global fire alarm, this report is the arson investigation,"" UNEP deputy executive director Joyce Msuya said in a statement. 
""The science is clear; for all the ambitious climate action we have seen – governments need to move faster and with greater urgency. We are feeding this fire while the means to extinguish it are within reach,"" he added.
Institutions such as city, state and regional governments; companies; investors; higher education and civil society organizations are increasingly committing to climate action and are an important element in achieving global emissions goals.

Although estimates on the emissions reduction potential vary, some 19 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) could be reduced by their actions by 2030. This would be enough to close the 2C gap, the report said.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani made an investment pitch at a U.N. conference on Tuesday, describing the business opportunities and challenges in a country where millions are displaced or close to starvation.
The two-day conference, jointly hosted by the Afghan government and the United Nations, will evaluate whether strategies and aid are helping to resolve the quagmire created by Afghanistan's 17-year war, clearing the way for the withdrawal of foreign troops.
""It's a different Afghanistan. We're open for business, I hope you're open for partnership,"" Ghani said, setting out a vision that would enable growth of ""nine percent and in double digits"".
Afghanistan needed to focus on ""market building"", with individual entrepreneurs forming creditworthy companies that could build value chains to take advantage of available trade preferences.
""The main problem of the market is the firm,"" he said. ""What we require is a national strategy of competition.""
He said Afghanistan needed help with the renewables revolution to exploit its ""amazing potential of 220,000 megaWatts of solar and 80,000 megaWatts of wind"".
""We need to make a jump in energy, the way we took a jump in telecoms, going directly to mobiles instead of (land)lines,"" Ghani said.
The country also had $1 trillion in natural resources, and new mining and hydrocarbon laws have finally created the stable policy environment needed for investment, he said.
In a stark reminder of security challenges, three U.S. service members were killed and three wounded when an improvised explosive device detonated on Tuesday near the central Afghan city of Ghazni, the NATO-led Resolute Support mission said in a statement. The Taliban, who control large parts of Ghazni province, claimed responsibility for the attack.
Presidential Banking and Finance Adviser Ajmal Ahmady said laws passed in the last year had made it easier to start, invest in and close a business, and the next focus would be on making it easier to operate a business.
""We feel we’re finally ready to move from potential to production in our natural resources sector,"" Ahmady said. 
The government has ended its monopoly in telecoms and planned to do the same in land development and other sectors this year and next, he said. 
Afghanistan's location would also be ""solid gold"" in the next 50 years, at the crossroads of south, central and west Asia, a potential market of 4 billion people, Ghani said.
However, Afghanistan has the wrong education system to take advantage of the opportunities, and entrepreneurs could not get started because they lacked access to credit. 

""Monetary policy is killing us,"" Ghani said. ""In this environment entrepreneurial energy cannot be individual, it needs to become collective and supported.""

PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday he understood the anger felt by voters outside France's big cities over the squeeze that fuel prices have put on households, but insisted he would not be bounced into changing policy by ""thugs"".
For over a week, ""yellow vest"" protesters have blocked roads across France and impeded access to some fuel depots, shopping centers and factories in protest against fuel tax hikes they say have eroded their spending power.
The unrest, including violent skirmishes stirred by fringe groups in Paris over the weekend, has stung Macron as he tries to fight back against a sharp fall in popularity and exposed him to charges of being out of touch with voters.
A little over 18 months into his presidency, it has raised questions about whether the 40-year-old former investment banker has misjudged his ability to overhaul France and its economy.
""We must not change course, because the policy direction is right and necessary,"" Macron said in an hour-long address outlining his blueprint for a transition towards cleaner energy.
Striving to show both humility and empathy with anger among provincial voters, he said his administration needed to be smarter in its policymaking to avoid the emergence of a ""two-speed France"" where workers living outside cities were left behind and grew more frustrated with a perceived urban elite.
The crisis, though, illustrated a ""paradox"" in a country that cherishes its generous welfare state and was becoming less inclined to pay for it through taxes, he said.
""You cannot chant in the same slogan: 'cut taxes and build more crèches, schools',"" Macron said.
UNIMPRESSED
Two people have been killed and more than 600 injured during the 11 days of 'yellow vest' protests across France.
Macron has warned that the violence which turned some Parisian boulevards into battlefields on Saturday risked unnerving foreigners, though he acknowledged on Tuesday that many protesters held legitimate grievances.
""I will not confuse citizens and their demands with thugs,"" Macron said. ""I will not cede any ground to those who want to destroy and create disorder,"" Macron said. 
But he conceded the increase in diesel tax, which kicked in just as pump prices were rising, had inflicted more pain than anticipated.
He sought to dampen the anger of protesters, dubbed ""yellow vests"" because of the high-vis jackets they wear at their barricades, with a proposal to review fuel tax rates quarterly to take into account global oil prices. 
Protesters manning the roadblocks and the president's political opponents were unimpressed with Macron's overtures, even after the president said his ecology minister would meet representatives of their protest movement later in the day.
""We're all fed up,"" one protester told BFM TV. ""He's not listening to us. Our anger is real."" 
Far-right leader Marine Le Pen lambasted the speech as ""devoid of any solutions"", while the Socialist Party leader Oliver Faure said Macron had turned a deaf ear to voters' complaints.
Conservative lawmaker Damien Abad said Macron's remarks underlined the reality gap between the Elysee Palace and the rest of France. 

""This was a technocrat's speech, disconnected from the reality of French and not touching on their worries, including those of the 'yellow vests',"" he said in a television interview.

The defendant, identified as Sergei W., admitted to staging the roadside attack in April 2017 but said he wanted to make money rather than harm or kill anyone.
He had been charged with 28 counts of attempted murder, inflicting grievous bodily harm and of causing an explosion.
The team had been heading to the club stadium - Germany's biggest with capacity of 80,000 - for a Champions League match against AS Monaco when the bomb exploded. Defender Marc Bartra was hurt on the arm and the match was delayed by a day. 
The defendant has expressed deep regret for what he had done, saying he had not meant to harm anyone. His lawyer said he had planned the attack to trigger a fall in BVB's share price from which he could profit. 
Prosecutors, who wanted him to be imprisoned for life, had argued that the defendant bought some 44,000 euros ($49,800)worth of options on the day of the attack which he could have sold at a profit if the share price had dropped. 
In fact, BVB shares rose after the attack. Shares in the club also climbed 2.7 percent on Monday after the club's latest victory in the Bundesliga took it to the top of the German table.

488,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2018 08:30AM ET</span>",Ex-militant tests Somalia's fledgling democracy,"By Hereward Holland
NAIROBI (Reuters) - Last year Mukhtar Robow had a $5 million U.S. bounty on his head. Now the former Islamist al Shabaab militant has downed his guns and donned the garb of a democrat.
    While Robow is not the first ex-militant to enter Somali politics, the momentum behind his bid to become a regional leader has turned his effort into a watershed moment in the stand-off between the federal government and Somali’s seven semi-autonomous regions.
    How Mogadishu and those states ultimately find ways to share power – including via elections such as the Dec. 5 vote in the South West state where Robow is running – is critical.
    ""It’s a pivotal point in the confrontation between the government and federal member states, which is probably a much greater threat to Somalia’s security than al Shabaab itself,” said Matt Bryden, head of the Nairobi-based think tank Sahan Research.
    That confrontation is now being played out through Robow, a key figure in the country’s troubled recent history.
   Somalia has been trying to claw its way out of the civil war that engulfed it in 1991, when clan warlords overthrew a dictator and then turned on each other.
    Al Shabaab has been fighting for more than a decade to topple the weak central government and implement strict Islamic law, often sending suicide bombers against civilian targets.
    Once a charismatic spokesman for the group known for his military fatigues and long beard, Robow fell out with the leadership in 2013 following a power struggle.
    He laid low with his militia for several years before renouncing violence and recognizing the authority of the federal government in August 2017. He is now running as an independent.
    During this time the U.S. withdrew a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture and removed him from their list of sponsors of terrorism, although other international sanctions remain on him.
    The former insurgent, who once spent time training with the Taliban, has cast himself in a civilian role, donning dark suits and a clerical cap. After the Shabaab bombing that killed around 500 people last year, Robow was photographed donating blood. 
    On Sunday, the state electoral commission announced it had accepted his candidature, dismissing federal demands that he be barred because of remaining U.S. Treasury Department sanctions.
    Other states like Jubbaland and Puntland, who have their own polls slated for the coming months, are watching closely whether the government tries again to block Robow’s candidacy.
""If they (the government) try to force the candidate that people want out, they can also do that in other areas. Then there will be no peace,"" a senior Somali regional official told Reuters. 
    Somalia’s ministry of information did not respond to requests for comment on Robow’s case after the Sunday ruling of the election comission.
A PROPAGANDA COUP?
    Robow's allies and some analysts suggest central government is less concerned with his past and more worried his popularity with the Rahanweyn clan - one of Somalia’s most powerful – will propel him to victory ahead of their chosen candidate.
    Robow himself has not yet reacted publicly, but hours after submitting his papers to the electoral commission, five other candidates threw their support behind him.
    ""All the intellectuals, youth and traders of South West state, have... decided Sheikh Mukhtar Robow will be our candidate,"" Hassan Haji, who had himself been a candidate, said just after the commission's announcement.
Robow is campaigning on a security card, promising in an October rally: ""If I win, I will eliminate the al Shabaab militants, bandits in government unforms and other clan militias who disturb our South West state.""
    For many Somalis, Robow’s rehabilitation as a politician would be a step too far.  Much of the online debate about him refers to the attacks he helped coordinate with al Shabaab.
    Yet despite their misgivings and those of the central government, Robow could also become a potential thorn in al Shabaab's side, some analysts believe.

489,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2018 08:26AM ET</span>","British PM May rebuts Trump trade comments, says UK-U.S. deal is on track","LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May rebutted U.S. President Donald Trump's warning about the future of anglo-American trade, saying a trade deal was possible and that work toward it was making good progress.
Trump said on Monday the agreement by which the United Kingdom will leave the European Union may make trade between Washington and London more difficult - handing ammunition to May's critics at home who want to block the Brexit deal.
She said on Tuesday: ""We will have an independent trade policy and we will be able to do trade deals with countries around the rest of the world,"" citing a political declaration on future relations with the EU agreed in Brussels on Sunday. 
""As regards the United States, we've already been talking to them about the sort of agreement that we could have in the future,"" she told broadcasters. ""We've got a working group set up which is working very well and has met many times.""
May's spokesman said there had already been positive and productive discussions on an ambitious trade deal through joint working groups and cited public consultations on both sides of the Atlantic as signs of progress.
Asked whether May planned to hold a bilateral meeting with Trump at a G20 summit later this week, the spokesman said there were no such plans.
""It's not something we've requested,"" he said. ""We've met with the president on a number of occasions in recent months.""
With May facing a difficult battle to get parliament to approve her deal, Trump's words struck at the heart of the government's key argument for the current Brexit accord: that it would allow Britain to strike new global trade deals without abruptly shutting off access to EU markets. 
Alongside the prime minister's words, the government published a ""press rebuttal"" blog expanding on her arguments and setting out Britain's plans to pursue a range of post-Brexit trade deals and play an active role on the world stage.
""After we leave the EU in March next year, we will take up our independent seat at the (World Trade Organization) where we will play an active role in negotiations and be strong advocates for the rules-based global trading system,"" the blog said.

491,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2018 08:19AM ET</span>",EU's top court will give 'quick' verdict on whether UK can reverse Brexit,"By Michael Holden
LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Europe's top court said on Tuesday it would decide ""quickly"" whether Britain can unilaterally reverse its decision to leave the European Union, a ruling supporters of EU membership hope could lead to a second referendum and ultimately stop Brexit.
Lawyers for a group of Scottish politicians want the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to interpret whether Britain can revoke its notice to withdraw from the EU under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty without agreement of the other 27 states.
Britain is due to exit the EU on March 29, two years after London served notice in line with a June, 2016 vote to leave. 
But the fate of Brexit remains up in the air, with Prime Minister Theresa May's draft divorce deal, agreed with the EU on Sunday, facing a difficult vote in parliament on Dec. 11. May has said that if her deal is voted down, Britain could leave without a deal or there could be no Brexit at all. [nL8N1Y21KX]
Some opponents of Brexit want a second referendum giving British voters the option to remain in the EU. May's government says a second referendum will not happen, and any ECJ ruling that would allow the reversal of Britain's withdrawal notice would be irrelevant since it is against government policy.
The ECJ said it would deliver its decision ""quickly"" but gave no specific date.
""The British government don't seem to want (lawmakers) and the public to know that Article 50 can be revoked. That's why they fought this case so hard,"" Joanna Cherry, a Scottish National Party lawmaker and one of the cross-party group of pro-EU politicians that brought the case told Reuters.
The case was referred to the Luxembourg justices for a ruling by Scotland's top court and ""expedited"" for Tuesday's urgent one-day hearing before a full court of judges.
Article 50 of the EU treaty, which sets the rules for leaving the bloc, states that if a country decides to withdraw, it has two years to agree an exit deal, a deadline which can be extended only if the remaining EU states unanimously agree.
There is no mention of whether a state can change its mind. No other member state has ever left the 60-year-old bloc. 
Aidan O'Neill, lawyer for the politicians, told the ECJ a ruling was necessary so lawmakers could make informed decisions.
""These petitioners need to know the options for revocation which are open to withdrawing member states now, to allow them - properly and in a fully informed way - to carry out their duties as democratically elected representatives,"" he said.
If Britain could not unilaterally reverse Brexit, then it could be forced out against its wishes, he said. 
""It is fundamental to the treaties - and to the values of the European Union - that a member state can choose to revoke its withdrawal from the Union, without the need for the unanimous agreement of all the other member states,"" he said. 
PANDORA'S BOX
Richard Keen the lawyer for the British government, said the ECJ should refuse to consider the issue at all, saying it was hypothetical as the UK had no plans to reverse Brexit.
""As you know, the UK does not intend to revoke its notification,"" said Keen. 
He said the court should not interfere in domestic politics saying the anti-Brexit campaigners wanted a ruling for ""political ammunition"", likening it to opening Pandora's Box.
""We respectfully plead that the court should not open this box,"" Keen said.
Lawyers for the EU institutions told the judges revocation would need the unanimous agreement of the other 27 EU states to stop others from abusing the process.

Hubert Legal, representing the EU's executive Commission, said it could allow states to notify their intent to leave and then seek better terms from the remaining EU countries, to ""charm the notifying sheep back to the flock"".

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea plans to buy two Israeli early warning radar systems, it said on Tuesday, as it reinforces air defenses against North Korea despite fast-improving relations. 
The decision to adopt the two Green Pine Block C radar systems, built by ELTA Systems, a subsidiary of state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries, was made at a defense acquisition committee, Seoul's arms procurement agency, DAPA, said. 
DAPA did not specify the value of the order, but an official at the defense ministry put it at 330 billion won ($292 million), saying the systems would be deployed in the early 2020s. 
The project is intended to boost South Korea's capabilities to ""detect and track ballistic missiles from a long distance at an early stage"", DAPA said in a statement. It did not mention North Korea. 
But South Korea's defense ministry said last December it would buy additional early warning radars after North Korea successfully tested an intercontinental ballistic missile and declared completion of the ""state nuclear force"" a month earlier. 
Reclusive North Korea and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. 
North Korea has for years pursued nuclear and missile programs in defiance of U.N. sanctions. But the two Koreas moved to defrost their relations this year, clinching a comprehensive military agreement at their summit in September in Pyongyang aimed at defusing military tensions around the heavily fortified border.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump pledged to work toward denuclearization at their landmark June summit in Singapore, but the agreement was short on specifics and negotiations have made little headway since.

Kim, president of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly, the North's rubber-stamp parliament that meets once or twice a year, arrived in Caracas on Monday. He met with Venezuelan foreign minister Jorge Arreaza, the foreign ministry said in a statement. 
Maduro's welcoming of the North Korean leader comes as he deepens diplomatic relations with rivals of the United States and many European countries, such as Russia, China and Turkey, amid hyperinflation and a fifth year of economic contraction in Venezuela.
The United States and Europe have placed sanctions on Venezuelan government officials and blocked some financial transactions with the country in response to allegations of corruption, human rights violations, and a vote to re-elect Maduro in May that has been widely derided internationally as a sham.
Maduro blames an 'economic war' waged by the United States and domestic political rivals for the country's problems. Critics say a failing socialist economic model is responsible for a humanitarian crisis, which has prompted 3 million people to emigrate since 2015.
The U.S. government is also weighing adding Venezuela to its list of state sponsors of terrorism, which currently includes North Korea, Iran, Sudan and Syria, a person familiar with the deliberations said last week.
Tensions over North Korea's tests of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles spiked on the Korean peninsular last year and there were fears of a U.S. military response to North Korea's threat to develop a weapon capable of hitting the United States.
Talks in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have allayed those concerns, and a detente between Pyongyang and Seoul has opened the door to closer ties. Kim Yong Nam made an unprecedented visit to South Korea before it hosted the Winter Olympics earlier this year.

After Deby wound up his two-day visit, Israel said in a statement that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would ""visit Chad soon and announce, with the Chadian president, the renewal of ties"". No date was given.
Chad is a Muslim-majority country, and most Muslim or Arab countries do not have formal ties with Israel. 
Some African countries have kept their distance from Israel since its occupation of the Palestinian territories in the 1967 Middle East war, but the Netanyahu government has been keen to improve relations with the continent.
Some Sunni Muslim countries have also drawn closer to Israel in recent years due to shared concerns about the rise of Shi'ite power Iran.
Meeting in Jerusalem, Netanyahu and Deby ""discussed shared threats and the struggle against terrorism"" as well as cooperation in agriculture, solar energy, water security and health, the statement from the Israeli premier's office said.

Netanyahu has cited Chad's renewed relationship with his country as an example of how Israel can make diplomatic inroads in Africa and in the Middle East despite its on-going conflict with the Palestinians.

495,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2018 06:53AM ET</span>",Egypt's poor bear brunt of crackdown on farmland building,"By Lena Masri and Ali Abdelaty
IKYAD DIJWI, Egypt (Reuters) - In the home he shared with 11 relatives, Mohammed Abd al-Hamid had no room to start a family. But since he put up a house on a nearby field in 2016, he has paid $4,500 in fines for building on agricultural land. 
""There was no alternative,"" said Abd al-Hamid, 30, who works for a Cairo security company, standing in front of his pink-painted house in the Nile Delta. ""Am I supposed to rent an apartment in Cairo? I can't afford that."" 
Egypt's population of nearly 100 million is growing rapidly and about 38 million live in unplanned communities. 
In the turmoil after the 2011 Arab Spring, the number of unlicensed buildings sky-rocketed. Now authorities are cracking down on residents who build on farmland, but are providing few alternatives for those who need cheap houses.
People who build on agricultural land now face up to five years in prison and a fine of up to 5 million Egyptian pounds ($280,000). Before the law was revised in January, the top fine was 50,000 pounds ($2,800) and the prison term wasn't specified.
Authorities say they want to end unlicensed building on farmland, reduce overcrowding and provide homes for the poor, but analysts say many new government housing projects are too expensive and have poor services. 
As a result, large numbers of new homes are unoccupied, while people still build on farmland in areas where housing demand is high.
""This shows you it's a distorted housing market and price incentives and accessibility have not worked out,” said Michele Dunne, director of the Middle East Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a think-tank.
Under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the military has been seeking ways to tighten control over the population, she said.
""And one of these ways seems to be controlling real estate development and channeling people toward the communities the government is building rather than communities that sprout out organically in places where people want to live.""
The military owns 51 percent of a firm that is developing a new capital east of Cairo. 
ILLEGAL CONSTRUCTION UP
Since the 2011 revolution, nearly 85,000 acres of farmland have been lost to illegal construction, according to data from the ministry of agriculture. 
That's a 40 percent average annual increase compared to before 2011, according to a Reuters calculation based on data going back to 1983. 
Of those 85,000 acres, 28,000 have been cleared of buildings, but most is not being farmed, the ministry said.
On Monday, the government started a campaign to demolish unlicensed buildings from 19,000 acres of farmland.
""Look at the size of the encroachments on agricultural land,"" Sisi said in September.
""If it continues at this rate ... then we will have unplanned growth that requires spending on healthcare that's not available, clean water that's not available, roads and electricity networks that are not available. That can't be.""
The Nile Delta, one of the most densely populated parts of the country, is also one of the hardest hit by unlicensed construction on farmland.
""Where else should we build?"" said Sahar Fathi Ayed, 40, Abd al-Hamid's sister, who has built a house on the family's fields in the village of Ikyad Dijwi.
""Our children got older and wanted to get married and there are no rental apartments here,"" she said.
Lack of housing is no excuse for building on farmland, said Hamed Abd al-Dayem, spokesman for the ministry of agriculture.
In an effort to tackle its growing housing needs, Egypt has launched a series of housing projects and is developing 42 new cities, but many are underoccupied. 
New Cairo, Sheikh Zayed and Shorouk have occupancy rates of 65, 50 and 55 percent respectively, according to Leilani Farha, U.N. special rapporteur on housing. 
One of the more established new cities, 6th of October, has an occupancy rate of 75 percent, she said. People in some new cities have limited access to schools, clinics, emergency services, transport and food, she said.
""There also appears to be a lack of income mix within housing estates and a tendency towards gated communities for upper income housing,"" Farha wrote in a statement following a visit to Egypt last month.
The government does have a social housing program for low and middle-income families, she said, but only 2.2 percent of all social housing benefits Egyptians with the lowest incomes.
Jamal al-Sayed, who left farming when fuel for his tractors became too expensive, sees no alternative to building on his farmland.
""I built a house for my son so he could get married,"" said Sayed, 53, who now works in a bakery. ""There's a lack of housing in our town. So I built on the land that I own.""
Homes in the town are small and people are forced to build when their families expand. He has paid 60,000 Egyptian pounds ($3,000) in fines since he built the house in 2013.
Residential land tends to be expensive, said Kevin Graham, the Oxford Business Group's editorial manager in Egypt. ""Developers pick up this land but end up often building very high-cost homes rather than affordable homes,"" he said. 
Stricter punishment for building on farmland is part of the government's effort to boost revenue through taxation, he said.
""But in order for it to really be a solution, other options must be made available to those driven to build outside of the formal system,"" he said.
Egypt is the world's top wheat importer and authorities want to end building on farmland and grow more at home. The government is also trying to reclaim areas in the desert for agricultural use, said General Mohamed Helmy Abd el-Hamed Rashwan, executive manager of The General Authority for Rehabilitation Projects and Agricultural Development at the ministry of agriculture.

""It can't be right that while we're trying to cultivate the desert we are losing beautiful Egyptian farmland,"" he said. ""Agricultural land is a red line.""

MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Concerned about producing a generation of children with hunched backs and other spine problems, India has denounced schools for making students carry heavy school bags and giving young children homework.
The government has issued weight guidelines for school bags depending on a child's age, citing studies that show how the load can affect soft, developing spines.
One survey done by the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India found that 68 percent of pre-teen children might suffer from mild back pain, which can develop into chronic back pain, and later into a hunchback.
The study, which covered more than 2,500 children and 1,000 parents in major cities, found that more than 88 percent of children from seven to 13 carry more than 45 percent of their body weight on their backs.
Rashmi Tapke, a mother of two, said heavy school bags reflect poor time-table planning and said she supports the federal initiative.
""If they (schools) plan, they can repeat the subjects taught and thus reduce the load. My kids find it difficult to carry so many books,"" Tapke, whose children attend a private school in Mumbai, said.
The state of Maharashtra, where Mumbai is located, mandates that the weight on the bag should not exceed 10 percent of the child's body weight. Many schools there have started using white boards and projectors to ensure text books are not required to be carried to school.
But in large parts of rural India, children have to walk great distances, weighed down by school bags. Children have been known to ford rivers, some with books on their heads, to get to school.
""My frail daughter has to haul about 4-5 kgs of books in her school bag and also carry her lunch box and water bottle in a separate bag,"" said driver Rajinder Shukla, whose child attends a school in most populous Uttar Pradesh state.

The federal circular also suggests that no home work be assigned to kids in grades 1 and 2 which will also ensure they don't need to carry books home.

The three-day campaign which began on Monday is organized by the U.N. children's agency UNICEF, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the health ministry of the Houthi movement which controls most population centers in the country where millions face starvation, making them more vulnerable to diseases. 
""The campaign comes at a very critical time,"" said Meritxell Relano, UNICEF's representative in Yemen.
""The lack of a fully functional healthcare system and widespread malnutrition have drastically increased the risk of preventable diseases.
""It's very important that all the parties to the conflict allow unhindered access to enable us to reach all children, from north to south, east to west, with this vital vaccine.""
A Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen's civil war in 2015 against the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement to restore the internationally recognized government, causing the world's most pressing humanitarian crisis.
Save the Children said last week that an estimated 85,000 children under the age of five may have died from extreme hunger.
Yemen was declared polio-free in 2009, but experts say conflict-affected countries are particularly at risk of outbreaks because of disruption to their health systems.
Yemen also carried out a vaccination campaign in February, 2017 against polio, which spreads quickly among children and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours.
In the Houthi-held capital Sanaa on Monday, nurses delivered oral vaccines to children on dusty streets, some of whom cried and tried to squirm away.
They marked the fingers of vaccinated children with black felt pens, and used white chalk on doors of houses that had been covered in the immunization drive.
""Thank you to this immunization team, who in these difficult times, when the people need every riyal, have decided to pass by every house, saving transportation fees and effort for the people,"" Sanaa resident Abdo Ahmed Ali said.
""That's why we must thank them from our hearts.""
Yemen is home to the world's worst cholera outbreak, with 10,000 suspected cases reported per week, the WHO said last month.

It said 16 percent of Yemen’s cholera cases were in the main port city of Hodeidah, the focus of the war, where only half the health facilities are operational.

TIJUANA (Reuters) - After nearly two weeks of documenting the harrowing journey of a caravan of mostly Central American migrants headed towards the U.S.-Mexican border, I snapped a picture I will never forget.
In the shot, taken on Sunday, you can see Honduran mother Maria Meza, 35, grabbing the thin arms of her two 5-year-old twin daughters Cheili and Saira as they frantically run from a tear gas canister spewing fumes.
Cheili is seen in diapers, Saira barefoot, while their mother wears a t-shirt showing the smiling sisters from the Disney hit ""Frozen,"" a movie I've seen many times with my own daughter.
Mesa's 13-year-old daughter, Jamie, is behind her mother in the photo, also running away from the approaching gas.
In the frantic moments after the canisters hit the ground, the acrid smell was everywhere and I could see children crying, their eyes stung by the gas.
""I thought I was going to die with them because of the gas,"" Meza told my Reuters colleagues a day later, adding that she was shocked U.S. border agents would fire the canisters near women and children.
The U.S. government said the customs officers had fired off the canisters after a group of migrants had attempted to cross the border violently, throwing projectiles at them. 
Meza's family had made it to the El Chapparal border crossing, which straddles the Mexican city of Tijuana and San Diego on the U.S. side, after leaving their home in the violent city of San Pedro Sula in northern Honduras two months ago.
Sunday's incident happened after a group of migrants in Tijuana rushed at the border fencing.
Just before the tear gas was fired, I had followed some of the migrants as they approached a section of the border fence recently reinforced with razor-studded coils. U.S. border agents warily eyed the group from the other side.
Meza and her children said they had already spent a week at a Tijuana shelter, but they will likely have to wait much longer for a chance to ultimately plead their case. 
She said she hopes to be granted asylum in the United States due to rampant crime back home, and if successful will travel to Louisiana, where the girls' father lives.

499,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2018 05:35AM ET</span>",Indonesia gives first report on deadly Lion Air crash on Wednesday,"By Jamie Freed and Cindy Silviana
SINGAPORE/JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian investigators will deliver their first report into the Lion Air crash on Wednesday, a month after the brand-new Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 crashed into the sea, killing all 189 on board in the country's second-worst air disaster.
The report, which comes as the search continues in the Java Sea for the jet's cockpit voice recorder, is not expected to draw firm conclusions from the ongoing investigation into the Oct. 29 crash. 
However, investigators have said they are focusing their attention on the Boeing 737's anti-stall system.
The doomed jet's systems had detected it was in a stall due to a faulty indicator and gave the captain a warning through a ""stick shaker"" that vibrated the controls, Nurcahyo Utomo, an investigator at Indonesia's transport safety committee (KNKT), told parliament last week.
The Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) - an automated modification new to the model that crashed - activated and directed the jet's nose down to prevent a stall, Utomo said.
The pilots counteracted that successfully for some time before the plane entered a final dive, he added.
The same anti-stall system had activated on the jet during a flight the previous evening, but the pilots in that case managed to shut off the system, Utomo said.
The crash was the first involving the latest model of Boeing's best-selling 737 series, the 737 MAX, which entered service a year ago.
MCAS was not described in the Lion Air flight manual before the crash, KNKT has said, nor in those used by American airlines according to U.S. pilot unions.
However, the cockpit procedure for dealing with a runaway stabilizer remains unchanged from earlier 737 models.
Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said earlier this month that Boeing provides ""all of the information that's needed to safely fly our airplanes"" but the jet's manual and training methods have come under scrutiny after the crash.
In response to initial findings from the jet's flight data recorder, Boeing issued a bulletin to airlines reiterating procedures and advising them to add information on MCAS to flight manuals, which was followed by a U.S. Federal Aviation Administration directive making that mandatory. 
A Boeing spokeswoman on Tuesday declined to comment on the investigation, but said Boeing had discussed MCAS functions with more than 60 airline operators globally since 2016.
Lion Air's maintenance practices and pilot training also face scrutiny after investigators said the doomed jet had problems with airspeed indicators on its final four flights. 
Lion Air, one of Asia's largest budget carriers, says it tackled safety concerns highlighted by previous incidents.
Most air accidents are caused by a cocktail of factors and investigations typically take around a year to complete. 
Investigators are expected to restrict their report to factual details from the jet's flight data recorder, which contains 69 hours of information from its last 19 flights. 
But they can include immediate recommendations if they have pressing safety concerns.
The search for the cockpit voice recorder is proving difficult after investigators said last week its ""ping"" signal was no longer being detected.
""We're still making efforts to find the CVR and it is very important. The CVR is related to the credibility of the country so that we can avoid the same incident,"" KNKT head Soearjanto Tjahjono told parliament.

500,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2018 05:10AM ET</span>",Ukraine introduces martial law citing threat of Russian invasion,"By Andrew Osborn and Natalia Zinets
MOSCOW/KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine on Monday imposed martial law for 30 days in parts of the country most vulnerable to an attack from Russia after President Petro Poroshenko warned of the ""extremely serious"" threat of a land invasion. 
Poroshenko said martial law was necessary to bolster Ukraine's defenses after Russia seized three Ukrainian naval ships and took their crew prisoner at the weekend.
U.S. President Donald Trump said he did not like what was happening between Russia and Ukraine and was working with European leaders on the situation.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called Russia's seizure of the Ukrainian vessels ""a dangerous escalation and a violation of international law"" and called for restraint from both countries.
""The United States condemns this aggressive Russian action. We call on Russia to return to Ukraine its vessels and detained crew members, and to respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Pompeo said in a statement.
The State Department said Pompeo spoke by phone with Poroshenko and reiterated strong U.S. support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russian ""aggression"".
The Ukrainian parliament approved the introduction of martial law after Poroshenko reassured some skeptical lawmakers that it would not be used to curb civil liberties or delay elections scheduled for next year.
It came at the end of a day when Ukraine and Russia traded accusations about Sunday's standoff and Kiev's allies weighed in to condemn Moscow's behavior.
With relations still raw after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and its backing for a pro-Moscow insurgency in eastern Ukraine, the crisis risked pushing the two countries into open conflict. 
""Russia has been waging a hybrid war against our country for a fifth year. But with an attack on Ukrainian military boats it moved to a new stage of aggression,"" Poroshenko said.
In a phone call with Poroshenko, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg offered the alliance's ""full support for Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty."" Ukraine is not a NATO member though it aspires to membership. 
Washington's envoy to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said Russia's actions were an ""outrageous violation of sovereign Ukrainian territory"" and sanctions on Russia would remain in place. 
The European Union, Britain, France, Poland, Denmark, and Canada all condemned what they called Russian aggression. German Chancellor Angela Merkel stressed the need for dialogue. 
The stand-off in the Azov Sea is more combustible now than at any time in the past four years as Ukraine has rebuilt its armed forces, previously in disarray, and has a new generation of commanders who are confident and have a point to prove.
(Map of the Kerch Strait bridge: https://tmsnrt.rs/2PRMbqh) 
""PROVOCATION""
Russia's foreign ministry blamed Kiev for the crisis.
""It's obvious that this painstakingly thought-through and planned provocation was aimed at igniting another source of tension in the region in order to create a pretext to ramp up sanctions against Russia,"" it said in a statement.
Such a policy was ""fraught with serious consequences,"" it said, adding that Kiev was acting in coordination with the United States and the European Union.
Russia summoned the ranking diplomat at Kiev's embassy in Moscow over the incident, the foreign ministry said.
In Kiev, Poroshenko said intelligence data suggested there was an ""extremely serious threat"" of a land-based operation against Ukraine by Russia.
""I have a document of intelligence in my hands ... Here on several pages is a detailed description of all the forces of the enemy located at a distance of literally several dozens of kilometers from our border. Ready at any moment for an immediate invasion of Ukraine,"" he said.
Martial law would allow Ukraine to respond swiftly to any invasion and mobilize resources as quickly as possible, he said. 
He dismissed ""dirty speculation"" by critics that he wanted to use the proposed measure to delay elections next year, where he faces a tough re-election fight and opinion polls show him trailing his opponents. Ukrainian lawmakers held a second vote to confirm the polls would take place as scheduled on March 31. 
UKRAINIANS WOUNDED, VESSELS HELD 
Russia's rouble currency (RUB=) weakened 1.4 percent against the dollar in Moscow on Monday, its biggest one-day fall since Nov. 9, while Russian dollar-bonds fell.
Markets are highly sensitive to anything that could trigger new Western sanctions, and therefore weaken the Russian economy. A fall in the price of oil (LCOc1) - Russia's biggest source of revenue - has made its economy more vulnerable.
The crisis erupted when border patrol boats belonging to Russia's FSB security service seized two small Ukrainian armored artillery vessels and a tug boat after opening fire on them and wounding three sailors on Sunday.
The Ukrainian vessels had been trying to enter the Sea of Azov from the Black Sea via the narrow Kerch Strait that separates Crimea from the Russian mainland.
Interfax news agency quoted Russia's human rights commissioner, Tatyana Moskalkova, as saying on Monday that 24 Ukrainian sailors were being detained. Three of the sailors were wounded but were not in a serious condition and were recovering in hospital.
The FSB said the Ukrainian ships had ignored warning shots, forcing Russian vessels to open fire for real, after they illegally entered Russian territorial waters.
A Reuters witness in Kerch, a port in Crimea, said the three Ukrainian vessels were being held there on Monday.
Domestic politics in Moscow also add to the combustibility of the situation.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has seen his high approval rating fall because of unpopular domestic policies. In the past, successful military action beyond Russia's borders has buoyed his popularity.

Tensions have long been brewing over the Azov Sea. Crimea, on the western shore, is now controlled by Moscow, the eastern shore is Russian territory, and the northern shore is controlled by Ukraine.

Abiy Ahmed has turned national politics on its head since coming to power in April by welcoming back exiled opposition and separatist groups, releasing prisoners and appointing a formerly jailed dissident as head of the election board.
The meeting focused ""on highlighting the reforms required to ensure the upcoming election is free & fair, and the shared responsibilities of all,"" his office said on Twitter. There was no immediate comment from any of the opposition groups.
Abiy's ruling EPRDF coalition has been in power in Ethiopia - a major Western ally in an unstable region - since 1991. The grouping and its affiliated parties currently hold all the seats in parliament.
Last week he appointed Birtukan Mideksa as head of the board preparing for the next national elections, scheduled for 2020. 
Birtukan was one of dozens of opposition figures arrested in the violent aftermath of a 2005 vote - when an opposition coalition stood against the government across the country, then challenged the EPRDF's victory.
Security forces opened fire on crowds who took to the streets accusing the government and the election board of rigging the 2005 vote. Dozens died.

Abiy - the first member of Ethiopia's majority Oromo group to lead a coalition long dominated by ethnic Tigrayans - has promised to rein in the powerful security services and started consultations to rework an anti-terrorism law that critics said had criminalized dissent.

SABRATHA, Libya (Reuters) - Departures of migrant-laden boats to Italy from Sabratha, formerly Libya's biggest people-smuggling hub, have slowed to a trickle thanks to a security crackdown triggered by European pressure that ejected the city’s top smuggler. 
But the local branch of Libya's coastguard feels neglected. It says it is still starved for resources, unable to run its own patrols with only one broken-down boat, one car and no uniforms. 
Sabratha, 75 km (47 miles) west of the capital Tripoli where people smugglers exploited gang lawlessness for years, was the main launchpad on Libya's Mediterranean coast for Italy-bound migrants, with the flow peaking in 2016 and early 2017.
Crossings fell off abruptly in July 2017 after the city's top smuggler, Ahmed al-Dabbashi - also known as Al-Ammu (the Uncle) - struck a deal with Tripoli authorities under Italian pressure to desist from trafficking migrants. Rival militia ejected Al-Ammu and his followers in fighting two months later, and have since consolidated their position, fending off an attempted comeback by Al Ammu earlier this month.
With European Union and Italian support, Libya's coastguard has increased interceptions of migrants in an area stretching 155 km (95 miles) off the coast, while charity rescue ships that once guided many of the migrants to Italy have retreated.
Migrant embarkations from Sabratha, a city of 120,000, have all but ceased. While thousands once set sail every week, 35 would-be migrants were detained in October in houses before they departed, officials said. 
""We don't have human traffickers any more. The militias are gone,"" said General Omar Almabrouk Abduljalil, head of a Sabratha operations room for military and security forces.
But the local Sabratha coastguard said it was not benefiting from EU support being channeled through Tripoli, where naval and interior ministry units have received nine patrol boats. 
Sabratha's coastguard has 150 members but just one car and a broken inflatable that was previously used by smugglers.
NO UNIFORMS
""We don't even have uniforms,"" said Ayman al-Dabbashi, a navy officer dressed in civilian clothes, who said he was transferred to Sabratha from Tripoli as some coastguard personnel who had collaborated with smugglers were pushed out.
""We can't do patrols. We can't fix the boat's engine,"" he said. ""The radar is broken.""
By way of explanation, Dabbashi said coordination between Tripoli and smaller coastal towns remains limited. 
In Sabratha, local security forces include veterans of the uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 as well as Salafists, an ultra-conservative Muslim group that has expanded its influence across the vast North African country.
""They support the army as volunteers in these exceptional times Libya is passing through,"" said Abduljalil, the Sabratha security coordinator.
With this year almost over, 22,541 migrants have arrived in Italy by sea since January, well down from the 119,369 in all of 2017, says the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
But many migrants are still dying when overladen, unsafe inflatables founder en route. A total of 1,277 are recorded to have drowned on the central Mediterranean route so far in 2018, compared to 2,786 in the same period last year, according to the IOM.
While officials say boat departures from Sabratha have stopped, migrants are sometimes detained trying to reach other coastal cities such as Zuwara near the Tunisian border.

""There is a new trend of Libyan families smuggling migrants from Tripoli to Zuwara for 500 dinars ($129),"" said Basim Bashir, who runs the Sabratha unit fighting illegal migration. ""So now we are also searching families at checkpoints.""

504,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2018 04:13AM ET</span>",Scholars condemn China for mass detention of Muslim Uighurs,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Countries must hit China with sanctions over the mass detention of ethnic Uighurs, hundreds of scholars said on Monday, warning that a failure to act would signal acceptance of ""psychological torture of innocent civilians"". 
Beijing has in recent months faced an outcry from activists, academics and foreign governments over mass detentions and strict surveillance of the Muslim Uighur minority and other ethnic groups in the restive western region of Xinjiang. 
In August, a U.N. human rights panel said it had received many credible reports that a million or more Uighurs and other minorities are being held in what resembles a ""massive internment camp that is shrouded in secrecy"" in the region.
Representatives from a group of 278 scholars in various disciplines from dozens of countries called on China at a news briefing in Washington to end its detention policies, and for sanctions directed at key Chinese leaders and security companies linked to the abuses.
""This situation must be addressed to prevent setting negative future precedents regarding the acceptability of any state's complete repression of a segment of its population, especially on the basis of ethnicity or religion,"" the group said in a statement.
Countries should expedite asylum requests from Xinjiang's Muslim minorities, as well as ""spearhead a movement for U.N. action aimed at investigating this mass internment system and closing the camps"", it said.
China rejects criticism of its actions in Xinjiang, saying that it protects the religion and culture of minorities, and that its security measures are needed to combat the influence of ""extremist"" groups that incite violence there. 
The country's Foreign Minister Wang Yi has said the world should ignore ""gossip"" about Xinjiang and trust the government.
But after initial denials about the detention camps, Chinese officials have said some people guilty of minor offences were being sent to ""vocational"" training centers, where they are taught work skills and legal knowledge aimed at curbing militancy.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Tuesday China's Xinjiang policies stemmed entirely from the need to combat terrorism.
""We resolutely oppose any foreign forces trying to interfere with Xinjiang affairs and China's domestic politics,"" he said at a regular news briefing in Beijing.
Michael Clarke, a Xinjiang expert at Australian National University who signed the statement, told reporters that China sought international respect for its weight in global affairs.

""The international community needs to demonstrate to Beijing that it will not actually get that while it's doing this to a significant portion of its own citizenry,"" Clarke said.

""Yes, he has asked Erdogan on the phone, whether they could meet in Buenos Aires. Erdogan's answer was 'Let's see',"" Cavusoglu told Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper. 
Erdogan and Prince Mohammed will attend the G20 meeting in Argentina later this week. ""At the moment there is no reason not to meet with the crown prince,"" Cavusoglu said.
Saudi-Turkish relations have been strained by the killing last month of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul. After offering numerous contradictory explanations, Riyadh said Khashoggi had been killed and his body dismembered when negotiations to persuade him to return to Saudi Arabia failed.
Saudi Arabia has repeatedly said the prince had no knowledge of the killing, which Turkey says was carried out at the Saudi consulate by a squad of 15 Saudi agents which included a member of Prince Mohammed's security team.
Erdogan has said the killing was ordered by the highest level of Saudi leadership but ruled out that it had come from King Salman, putting the spotlight instead on the 33-year-old crown prince.
U.S. President Donald Trump said last week Washington would remain a ""steadfast partner"" of Saudi Arabia despite saying that Prince Mohammed may have known about the plan to murder Khashoggi.
Asked if he knew for sure who in Riyadh gave the order to kill Khashoggi, Cavusoglu said that the team would not have acted on its own, but could not say anything else without proof.
Cavusoglu said Riyadh had offered to send identikit photos of local helpers who assisted in the cover-up. ""Why identikit pictures? The Saudis know the names,"" he said.
Turkey says it has recordings related to the killing which it shared with Western allies. Cavusoglu said he had listened to the recordings and that Khashoggi was killed within seven minutes.
""It was premeditated murder,"" he told the German newspaper, rather than a last resort after they failed to convince him to return to Saudi Arabia. 

""It can be heard how the forensics expert instructs the others: they should listen to music while he cuts up the body. One notices how he enjoys it.""

LONDON (Reuters) - One of British Prime Minister Theresa May's most trusted lawmakers said on Tuesday he will not back her Brexit deal, further stacking the odds against it passing through parliament next month.
Under the deal secured with EU leaders on Sunday, Britain would leave the bloc in March with continued close trade ties. But the agreement has attracted criticism from lawmakers of all parties, both from supporters of a cleaner break with the EU and from opponents of Brexit.
Michael Fallon, May's former defense secretary who resigned last year after a journalist accused him of sexual harassment, told BBC radio that British negotiators should head back to Brussels to secure a better divorce agreement.
Asked whether he would vote against the current deal, Fallon said: ""As it stands at the moment, yes. I don't think this gives us the certainty that we need and it is therefore a gamble.""
Some Brexit-supporting lawmakers in May's Conservative Party could support her deal if she sets out when she will quit, The Times newspaper reported.
May told lawmakers on Monday that no better deal was available and that no one could predict what would happen if they rejected it.
May has 314 active Conservative lawmakers in the 650-seat House of Commons and would need around 320 votes to ratify the deal under current attendance projections, when it goes to lawmakers on Dec. 11.
Her de facto deputy prime minister, Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington, told the BBC on Tuesday that no other plan was on the table. 
""There's no plan B because the European Union itself is saying the deal that is on the table is the one that we have had to compromise over,"" Lidington said.

Asked if Britain could delay Brexit to get a better deal, he said: ""It's not government policy and I don't really see that gets us anywhere because the EU has made its position very clear.""

Prospects for a treaty setting out Switzerland's ties to its biggest trading partner faded last month when negotiators could not reach a breakthrough after four years of talks.
The EU has been pressing Switzerland to ease rules that protect high Swiss wages against cross-border competition from skilled labor. Swiss unions are fighting this tooth and nail, leaving the outlook for a treaty deal in doubt.
The Swiss cabinet is due to address the status of talks on Friday, with leaders of all four parties in the coalition expressing scepticism that a deal can emerge this year ahead of elections in both Switzerland and for the European Parliament in 2019.
Brussels has been pressing Switzerland to agree a pact that would sit atop an existing patchwork of 120 sectoral accords and have the Swiss routinely adopt changes to single market rules.
Should treaty talks fail, the sectoral accords would stay in effect, but two-way ties would enter a deep freeze.
Brussels has said it could take punitive measures - including refusing to roll over recognition of Swiss bourse rules beyond the end of 2018 - should the talks fail, a threat that has touched off potential Swiss retaliation.

In a summary of its policy objectives for next year, Switzerland also said it was following Britain's exit from the EU closely and would prepare proposals on future bilateral ties.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Modern city-state Singapore is a predictable place: it's hot and humid every day, unabashedly pro-business, immaculately clean -no chewing gum anywhere - and the government is usually run by a Lee.
Last week, the wheels of change were set in motion through an opaque reorganization within the ruling People's Action Party (PAP), a move that put in place the likely successor once Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong steps aside.
Prime Minister Lee, the son of Singapore's founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, is nearly 67 and has said he will step down by the time he is 70.
Having held power since 2004, he is widely expected to go after an election that must take place by early 2021, and the end of the Lee era will pitch Singapore into a rare state of flux at a sensitive time.
Singapore's economic model is under threat, there is unease over inequality in the land of 'Crazy Rich Asians', and social media has given critics of the government - both genuine and fake - a platform that they've never had before. 
Since its separation from Malaysia in 1965, Singapore has become a rich, tiny rock of stability, surrounded by large, mostly Muslim, and politically less predictable neighbors. 
Living on an island of 5.6 million people, the only country in Southeast Asia where ethnic Chinese are in majority, Singaporeans are very conscious of the value of stability and security. 
That awareness, along with an appreciation of their relative prosperity, helps explain an ingrained reluctance to rock the boat. The PAP has won every election since Singapore's independence over half a century ago and there is no sign that the party's position is in jeopardy.
But its leaders are not taking anything for granted, especially after a political earthquake in next-door Malaysia, where a party that had led every post-colonial government suffered a humiliating election defeat in May. 
""The ruling party, the PAP, does not have a monopoly of power, does not have the right to rule Singapore indefinitely,"" Prime Minister Lee said days after the Malaysian vote.
Lee is only Singapore's third prime minister after his father and Goh Chok Tong, who had to contend with speculation he was a seat-warmer for the younger Lee - who served as deputy prime minister during his 14 years in charge.
Lee, 66, has already said he does not think any of his four children will enter politics. It is unclear whether Lee will withdraw from politics completely or retain influence as a senior statesman, as both Goh and his father had done.
Succession in Singapore had previously been decided over cake and coffee, years in advance, but this time it was left up to a group of sixteen ministers, dubbed the fourth generation, or 4G, to pick among themselves - a process that has been compared to how cardinals pick the pope.
The process concluded last Friday, when finance minister Heng Swee Keat, 57, was given a key position within the party's top decision making body and declared ""first among equals"".
Asked if Heng would take over as PAP leader once Lee steps aside, a party spokesman directed Reuters to local media reports which described him as the frontrunner or leader of the younger 4G ministers. He did not provide further comment.
UNTESTED LEADERSHIP
A jovial, bespectacled former central banker, Heng is seen as a 'safe pair of hands' - especially given one of Singapore's most immediate challenges is keeping its open economy on an even keel in the face of rising protectionism and trade disputes between global powers.
Commentators in Singapore's largely pro-government mainstream media noted that the PAP went to great lengths to stress its unity behind Heng, who in 2016 had suffered a stroke and collapsed during a cabinet meeting.
""Leadership transitions in political parties are generally never smooth,"" Straits Times news editor Zakir Hussain said in an article on Saturday, pointing to recent political ructions in Australia, Britain and Germany.
""There is no reason to expect that the PAP - which has stayed cohesive for most of the 59 years it has been in power - might not one day face such divisions.""
Former PAP lawmaker Inderjit Singh said the next election will be a ""referendum"" on the untested new leadership team.
""None of the 4G leaders have delivered ground breaking policy initiatives...So it is important for the 4G leaders to show...their own initiative of delivering policies that satisfy Singaporeans and they have to do it fast,"" said Singh. 
""If they fail, trust (in the PAP) will be eroded, and this could change the political landscape of Singapore."" 
Recently popularized by Hollywood film ""Crazy Rich Asians"", Singapore has some of the highest paid politicians in the world, partly to attract top drawer candidates to public service and partly to remove the temptations of corruption.
The prime minister, for example, earns S$2.2 million ($1.6 million) a year. 
Singapore's rapid growth from colonial backwater to low-tax, financial hub has lifted all boats, and its poor are still far better off than they would be in neighboring countries.
But there are rising concerns over inequality, particularly as its society is aging rapidly.
CRITICAL VOICES
Social media has given more space for criticism and dissent, and the PAP's political transition comes as Singapore steps up its battle against so-called ""fake news"".
In recent weeks, authorities have blocked access to a foreign-based news site, lambasted social media firm Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) for failing to take down a post, and seized equipment from local blog The Online Citizen (TOC) in a defamation investigation.
These incidents have strengthened calls from some lawmakers for legislation to tackle what they term 'deliberate online falsehoods'. 
""The reaction in recent times have been excessive,"" TOC's editor Terry Xu told Reuters. ""Typically, the Singapore government would just issue a general libel or rebuttal.""
Following the TOC incident, Human Rights Watch said in a statement it was concerned ""rights abusing attacks against freedom of expression will get worse as the ruling PAP contemplates a possible election in 2019"".
Reporters Without Borders, which ranks Singapore below Russia and Myanmar for press freedoms, also raised concerns about the TOC incident and the potential for a tougher government stance on the media as elections near. 
A spokeswoman for Singapore's communications ministry said in an emailed statement the TOC investigation ""is in no way related to elections"", adding:
""Robust discussions, including criticism of the government, take place every day on various platforms. But we will not allow the integrity of our public institutions to be impugned under the cover of free speech.""
Gillian Koh of the Institute of Policy Studies, one of the experts cited in a recent parliamentary report on fake news that recommended more legislation, said the upcoming election is ""an important factor"" for lawmakers.
Singapore's vulnerabilities, given its diverse society, the risk of terror threats, and its position as a financial hub were other strong reasons for bringing in such laws, she said. 
The government's latest run-ins with media ""strengthen the government's case"", Koh said, but she added that pursuit of stronger laws may also fuel cynicism that it was driven by ""partisan interests.""

YANGON (Reuters) - Authorities in Myanmar have seized a boat carrying 93 people, apparently Rohingya Muslims, fleeing displacement camps in western Myanmar's Rakhine State and hoping to reach Malaysia, an official said on Tuesday.
The boat is believed to be the third bound for Malaysia stopped in Myanmar waters since monsoon rains began to subside last month, bringing calmer weather, raising fears of a fresh wave of hazardous voyages after a 2015 crackdown on people smugglers.
Moe Zaw Latt, director of the government office in Dawei, a coastal town in southern Myanmar, said fishermen had reported a ""suspicious"" boat to authorities.
The navy stopped the boat on Sunday and detained the 93 people, who said they had come from the Thae Chaung camp in the Rakhine State capital of Sittwe, he said. 
Thae Chaung is about 900 km (560 miles) northwest of Dawei and holds internally displaced people, most of whom are stateless Rohingya.
""They said they ran away from the camp. They said they intended to go to Malaysia,"" said Moe Zaw Latt, adding authorities were preparing to send them back to Sittwe on Tuesday.
Photographs in media showed police standing by as passengers - many of them women in headscarves and children - huddled on the deck. 
The boat resembled vessels the Rohingya typically use to escape the apartheid-like conditions in Rakhine State, where their movements and access to services are severely curtailed.
The U.N. refugee agency has said Myanmar must ""address the root causes of displacement"", including the lack of citizenship for the Rohingya, who consider themselves native to Rakhine State.
Myanmar regards Rohingya as illegal migrants from the Indian subcontinent and has confined tens of thousands to sprawling camps outside Sittwe since violence swept the area in 2012.
More than 700,000 Rohingya crossed into Bangladesh last year fleeing an army crackdown in the north of Rakhine State, according to U.N. agencies.
U.N.-mandated investigators have accused the Myanmar army of ""genocidal intent"" and ethnic cleansing. Myanmar has denied most allegations of atrocities, blaming Rohingya insurgents who attacked police boats for sparking the exodus.
Myanmar officials say they are ready to accept Rohingya who want to return from Bangladeshi refugee camps. But refugees themselves and aid agencies oppose a repatriation plan that was due to begin on Nov. 15, saying conditions in Myanmar were not safe.
Myanmar detained 106 Rohingya men, women and children on a boat near the commercial hub of Yangon on Nov. 16, when their engine failed on their way from the Sittwe camps to Malaysia.

Those people have been returned to the camps, along with another group of more than 80 people whose boat was seized off the coast of southern Rakhine last week also bound for Malaysia, according to an aid worker in Sittwe monitoring the boat movements.

513,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2018 09:38PM ET</span>",Smog war casualty: China coal city bears brunt of pollution crackdown,"By David Stanway and Joseph Campbell
JINCHENG, China (Reuters) - Residents in the rugged, overmined city of Jincheng in northern China's coal heartland have been breathing a little easier after campaigns to reduce pollution forced dozens of collieries and chemical plants to close.
""Everything was covered in dust, and it's cleaner now,"" said Zhang Haibin, a 44-year-old farmer living in a largely abandoned hamlet on the edge of a defunct coal deposit that once attracted migrant workers from across the country.
But Jincheng has paid a heavy price, Zhang said.
Factories and coal mines have shut down, sending shockwaves through the local economy. The migrants have drifted away, and jobs are hard to find even for locals.
And the air is still not clean enough, falling short of the government's pollution targets. That means that as another punishing anti-pollution campaign gets underway this winter in smog-choked north China, Jincheng will be under even more pressure.
The city's experience illustrates the challenges facing the Chinese government as it tries to rein in pollution without further weighing on an economy that is showing signs of a slowdown, exacerbated by the effects of a bruising trade war with the United States.
Across north China, cities are struggling to strike a balance between reversing the environmental damage done by decades of breakneck growth and keeping their heavy industrial economies afloat.
Jincheng has done particularly poorly, according to the central government.
A sprawling, mountainous administrative region in the south of Shanxi province, Jincheng is still dominated by coal. Though many pits have been shut, the craggy landscape bears the scars of decades of excessive mining.
Residents say air quality has improved, but whiffs of sulfur pervade the city's industrial districts, and smoke can be seen billowing from factory chimneys.
Jincheng was the worst performer among 28 northern cities forced to impose special pollution measures last year, according to data from the Ministry of Ecology and Environment. 
It failed to meet its target of cutting concentrations of lung-damaging PM2.5 particles by 10 percent last winter, and recorded 1,819 pollution violations, the most of the 28 cities.
Summoned to Beijing in April to explain his city's poor performance, mayor Liu Feng said the city's gross domestic product plunged 9 percent and fixed asset investment 41 percent in the first quarter as a result of production cuts.
Feng told officials, at a meeting attended by Reuters, that he was ""deeply embarrassed"" and would seek to ""learn painful lessons"" about improving compliance this year.
Feng said city inspectors had been too ""passive"" and had failed to properly forecast smog build-ups or supervise industries. But he also blamed unfavorable weather conditions, as well as the city's ""industrial structure"", dominated by polluting power plants, steel mills and cement factories.
The economy bounced back after the winter curbs were lifted, with GDP growing 4.9 percent from a year earlier in the first three quarters of 2018, according to the city's statistics bureau, although fixed asset investment was still down 1.9 percent on the year.
But with the winter anti-pollution curbs that took effect on Nov. 1, Jincheng - like many cities in Shanxi - will again struggle to reconcile official pollution targets with their industrial structures.
Shanxi ""faces a very complex situation, it has few resources and its supervision capabilities are quite weak - it has a lot of different kinds of challenges,"" said Ma Jun, director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE), a non-government group that monitors pollution.
""Many cities in Shanxi rank the lowest in the country when it comes to environment law enforcement and information disclosure,"" Ma said.
Shanxi produces nearly a billion tons of coal a year, around a quarter of the national total, and despite promises to promote cleaner energy, its production of the fossil fuel actually increased in the first three quarters of 2018.
NO LENIENCY
Last year's winter smog crackdown was criticized for a ""one size fits all"" approach that failed to take account of local conditions, shuttering hundreds of factories whether they had implemented pollution controls or not.
Beijing has promised a more business-friendly campaign this year, setting lower emissions-cutting targets and promising to exempt environmentally compliant firms. 
But after its failures last year, Jincheng is unlikely to be treated leniently in the war on pollution, which is a signature policy of President Xi Jinping.
On Monday, inspectors said 19 firms in Jincheng had failed to follow rules to restrict output during a smog outbreak last week, the latest in a series of problems uncovered this year.
The city's coal districts are now in a state of siege as inspectors scour mines, coal processing facilities, chemical plants and storage depots for violations.
This winter, Jincheng aims to cut coal chemical production by 30 percent, and impose output curbs of as much as 50 percent in certain districts. It will also establish a 95-square kilometer ""no-coal zone"" banning household coal combustion and convert more than 9,000 households to gas. 
One manager with Shanxi Lanhua High-Tech (SS:600123), a local conglomerate involved in coal, chemicals and real estate, said the city was under far greater pressure.
The firm will completely shut down some of its subsidiaries in winter, and expects to lose around 450 million yuan ($64.84 million) in earnings over the winter period.
""This year the intensity is going to be stronger,"" said the manager, who requested anonymity because he wasn't authorized to talk to the media. 
DIVERSIFICATION 
Ma of the IPE said polluting firms in cities like Jincheng had long taken advantage of the system. Their failure to comply with costly rules means they could outcompete compliant rivals, and China needed to create a ""level playing field"" to make sure lawbreakers were eliminated from the market.
But at a meeting of China's parliament in March, delegates from Jincheng said the city needed more financial support from Beijing to diversify and regenerate its economy.
Despite years of crackdowns, Jincheng continues to rely heavily on coal, and while surviving mines have benefited from the closure of smaller rivals, related businesses - including local truckers - are struggling with higher compliance costs and intensifying competition.
Gas has now emerged as the major bright spot for the city, with its seams rich in coalbed methane, which has replaced coal as a source of heating for many outlying villages, but development will still take time.
""The GDP growth that Jincheng wishes to accomplish ... will be driven from gas today, while historically it would have been from coal,"" said Randeep Grewal, chairman of Greka, a unit of G3 Exploration (L:G3EG), which has drilled more than 4,500 coalbed methane wells in Jincheng.
""We are in that transition mode, and clearly in transition, you have a bit of growing pains, but the transition is irreversible.""
In the meantime, the legacy of coal is still being felt by residents of Jincheng like Zhang, the farmer.
His sparsely furnished home is riddled with dangerous cracks - the result of subsidence caused by mining - but he said he has not received enough compensation from the state to move out.
""They've even closed down livestock farms here because of the environmental policies and lots of farmers are out of work,"" he said. ""The government knows how to ask you for money but it doesn't know how to resolve the problems of ordinary people.""

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Human Rights Watch has asked Argentina to use a war crimes clause in its constitution to investigate the role of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in possible crimes against humanity in Yemen and the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Argentina's constitution recognizes universal jurisdiction for war crimes and torture, meaning judicial authorities can investigate and prosecute those crimes no matter where they were committed.
Human Rights Watch said its submission was sent to federal judge Ariel Lijo. Neither Lijo's office nor the office of Argentina's public prosecutor responded to requests for comment. 
HRW's Middle East and North Africa director Sarah Leah Whitson said the international rights group took the case to Argentina because Prince Mohammed, also known as MbS, will attend the opening of the G20 summit this week in Buenos Aires. 
""We submitted this info to Argentine prosecutors with the hopes they will investigate MbS's complicity and responsibility for possible war crimes in Yemen, as well as the torture of civilians, including Jamal Khashoggi,"" Whitson told Reuters. 
Argentine media cited judicial sources as saying it was extremely unlikely that the authorities would take up the case against the crown prince, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler.
The killing of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and a critic of the crown prince, at Riyadh's consulate in Istanbul six weeks ago has strained Saudi Arabia's ties with the West and battered Prince Mohammed's image abroad.
Western nations are also calling for an end to the Saudi-led military campaign in neighboring Yemen, which was launched by Prince Mohammed, as a humanitarian crisis there worsens. 

Cases taking advantage of universal jurisdiction have had success in the past, most notably in 1998 when Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon was able to order the arrest in London of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.

RIOHACHA, Colombia (Reuters) - Even though five-year-old Kamila is used to getting blood drawn, she cried out when the needle pricked her arm, clinging to her mother for comfort in a classroom-turned-clinic in the northern Colombian city of Riohacha.
Venezuelan Kamila was born premature at 30 weeks, weighing just 900 grams (2 lbs). Her early entry into the world came with kidney problems and cerebral atrophy that have delayed some parts of her development and kept her limbs spindly. 
She is one of thousands set to receive treatment this week from doctors and dentists from United States Navy hospital ship the USNS Comfort.
Many are Venezuelan migrants who have fled economic crisis across the border. Others are Colombians, including indigenous Wayuu, seeking care amid constant delays in Colombia's overcrowded health system.
The United Nations on Monday pledged $9.2 million in aid for Venezuela, where hunger and preventable disease are soaring due to food and medicine shortages. President Nicolas Maduro blames the country's problems on U.S. sanctions and an ""economic war"" led by political adversaries. [nL8N1Y15Q8]
Most patients, pre-screened by local authorities, will receive care on land in two clinics set up in schools, while those needing surgery will be flown by helicopter to the ship itself, anchored far offshore.
""The tests we needed for her would have cost so much in Venezuela, but here they did it in a few seconds,"" said Kamila's mother Yennymar Vilchez, 24, who arrived four months ago. 
The ship's staff last week treated more than 5,400 patients over five days in Turbo, a city near the jungle border with Panama, including 131 who had surgery. 
An estimated 2,500 will be seen in Riohacha, 91 kilometers (56 miles) from the border with Venezuela, through Friday.
The arrival of Venezuelans has burdened the beleaguered Colombian healthcare system, especially in border cities, where patients can wait months for basic care. 
""The migration crisis has certainly played a factor,"" Captain William Shafley told journalists after an opening ceremony. ""We're here to help the Colombian government and their obviously strained healthcare system."" 
Colombia, which has received about one million Venezuelan migrants, could be hosting four million by 2021, the government has said. [nL2N1WI1AB]
Many cross the countries' porous land border without documentation, heading onward to other Latin American countries like Ecuador and Peru. 
Outside the dentistry room, Yessica Epiayu, 29 and a member of the Wayuu indigenous community, corralled her six children, aged 3 to 11, as they took turns getting cleanings.
Her eldest son Orlando grinned broadly, proudly showing off a gifted dental mirror.
Some surgeries require too much follow-up to be performed on the ship and are referred back to local authorities.
Venezuelan Belkis Chirino, 29, a former restaurant manager, had hoped her 11-month-old daughter Jade could get pelvic surgery to guarantee she will walk despite a congenital deformity. 
But the doctors need further X-rays and the intense procedure, which risks damaging some nerves, will require significant time in the hospital.
""I'm grateful even though she doesn't get the surgery,"" said Chirino. ""At least they can help my Venezuelan brothers and sisters."" 
But others like Vilchez, Kamila's mom, got good news. Her daughter's kidneys are getting healthier and a new medication will help her other symptoms. 

""It's wonderful!"" she said, as she clutched the brown pharmacy bag, Kamila in her arms.

TIJUANA, Mexico (Reuters) - A migrant mother photographed running with her daughters from tear gas at the U.S.-Mexico border said she never expected the U.S. Border Patrol to fire gas canisters at children and families.
After traveling north from Honduras and spending a week in the Mexican border town of Tijuana, Maria Meza, 35, set out on Sunday with her five children to claim asylum at the U.S. border crossing.
She and hundreds of other Central American migrants were blocked by Mexican police and staged a protest in front of the border, some rushing the U.S fence. 
Three tear gas canisters shot from the U.S. side landed around Meza and her children, who range in age from toddlers to teenagers, she said in an interview at a Tijuana migrant shelter.
""The first thing I did was grab my children,"" said Meza. A photo of her clutching the hands of twin five-year-old daughters Saira and Cheili, as her 13-year-old daughter Jamie runs alongside, has gone viral and sparked angry reactions from some lawmakers and charities.
""I was scared, and I thought I was going to die with them because of the gas,"" said Meza.
Her young son James nearly fainted when a canister landed near him. Meza fell and struggled to get up amidst the gas. A young man gave her his hand and pulled her to her feet.
""We never thought they were going to fire these bombs where there were children, because there were lots of children,"" said Meza, sitting in view of the rusted-steel U.S. border fence.
""It wasn't right, they know we are human beings, the same as them,"" said Meza.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers were struck by projectiles thrown by the migrants.
Around 5,200 people who traveled in a caravan across Mexico are packed into the shelter in a stadium in Tijuana, living in makeshift tents. 
President Donald Trump has taken a hardline stance against the migrants, who have made their way north from violent and impoverished Central American countries. On Monday, he said Mexico should send them back to their home countries.
The U.S. Border Patrol said most of those assembled at the border were economic migrants who would not qualify for asylum.
""I came here for one reason, and that's because there is a lot of violence in Honduras,"" said Meza, as her children played with empty tear gas canisters shot by the Border Patrol.
The United States shut the crossing for several hours on Sunday and Trump has threatened to close the border entirely.

""If they close the border I ask God that here in Tijuana, or in another country they open doors to us, to allow me to survive with my children,"" said Meza.

DUBAI (Reuters) - A British academic was on his way home from the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday after a pardon saved him from a life sentence for spying, according to a Reuters photographer.
The UAE said it had pardoned Matthew Hedges after showing a video of him purportedly confessing to being a member of Britain's MI6 intelligence agency. Britain has denied he was a spy and welcomed his pardon.
Hedges boarded a flight to London in Dubai, according to a Reuters photographer at the airport.
Hedges, a 31-year-old doctoral student at Durham University, had been held since May 5, when he was arrested at Dubai International Airport after a two-week research visit. 
His family have cast him as a dedicated researcher who fell foul of the UAE's security and justice system. The UAE cast him as a British spy who was given a fair trial for grave espionage offences.
The case has strained ties between the long-time allies, leading London to issue a forceful diplomatic response after last week's verdict was handed down, with a warning that it could hurt relations.
The UAE president issued the pardon as part of a mass clemency of more than 700 prisoners to mark the country's National Day.
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt welcomed the pardon, which he called ""fantastic news"".
""Although we didn't agree with charges we are grateful to UAE government for resolving issue speedily,"" Hunt said. 
GULF SECURITY
The UAE had signaled on Friday that it was working on an ""amicable solution"" to the case after Prime Minister Theresa May had described last week's sentence as deeply disappointing.
His wife, Daniela Tejada, has said he was kept in solitary confinement for more than five months and the evidence presented against him consisted of notes from his dissertation research.
Last week's hearing lasted less than five minutes, she said.
The UAE's ambassador to the UK has disputed the account, saying the case was ""extremely serious"" and there had not been a ""five minute show trial.""
Minutes before the pardon was announced on Monday, a UAE government spokesman showed journalists a video of Hedges purporting to confess to belonging to Britain's Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) and researching which military systems the UAE was buying.
In the video, which was sometimes inaudible and shown with subtitles that could not be independently verified, Hedges appeared to say he approached sources as a doctoral student.
The spokesman, Jaber al-Lamki, said Hedges was ""100 percent a secret service operative"" and aimed ""to steal the UAE's sensitive national secrets for his paymasters"", but did not take questions on the case.
He said Hedges aimed to gather information on government figures including ""members of the UAE's ruling families and their networks"" and economic data related to strategic firms.
Hedges had built an extensive network of contacts while working with Dubai's Institute for Near East & Gulf Military Analysis (INEGMA), then returned to the UAE ""on assignment as an undercover student on research trip"", Lamki said.
His family dispute the UAE account. They said he was an academic whose dissertation research focused on sensitive topics in the UAE such as security structures, tribalism and the consolidation of political power in Abu Dhabi.

Like most Gulf states, the UAE brooks little public criticism of ruling family members, senior officials or policy and has prosecuted pro-democracy activists for what it calls insulting the country's leaders.

The top court salaries serve as a benchmark for other public sector pay and the hike will add an estimated 4 billion reais ($1 billion) to the deficit that Bolsonaro's economic team has promised to balance in one year.
Bolsonaro, who will inherit a gaping deficit when he takes office on Jan. 1, said earlier this month that this was ""not the moment"" to approve public sector pay increases.

Bolsonaro's economic team, led by University of Chicago-trained economist Paulo Guedes, plans to make a new proposal for overhauling the costly pension system, one of the main causes of the deficit that is driving up the country's public debt. Temer failed to get pension reform through Congress.

The embassy declined to comment on the exact nature of the threat. Congo government spokesman Lambert Mende said the United States had shared no information. 
The political situation in Congo is tense. Campaigning began last week for a Dec. 23 presidential election that is meant to select incumbent Joseph Kabila's successor.

GENEVA/CARACAS (Reuters) - The United Nations on Monday announced $9.2 million in health and nutritional aid for crisis-stricken Venezuela, where hunger and preventable disease are soaring amid the collapse of the country's socialist economic system.
It is the first U.N. emergency funding for the government of President Nicolas Maduro, which blames the country's economic problems on U.S. financial sanctions and an ""economic war"" led by political adversaries.
Government critics celebrated the move as a recognition by Venezuelan authorities that the country faces a humanitarian crisis - something Maduro has denied in the past - and a step toward treating a population starved of basic services. 
But some worry the funds could fuel the corruption of the ruling Socialist Party, which was put on display last week when a former Venezuelan treasurer told U.S. prosecutors he took $1 billion in bribes.
The U.N. Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) will support projects to provide nutritional support to children under five years old, pregnant women and lactating mothers at risk, and emergency health care for the vulnerable, CERF's website said. 
""CERF allocations are made to ensure a rapid response to sudden-onset emergencies or to rapidly deteriorating conditions in an existing emergency,"" according to CERF's website.
CERF mainly funds projects in countries at war or experiencing other crises like natural disasters, a U.N. official told Reuters, adding that other U.N. agencies may have provided funding to Venezuela through separate programs.
Venezuela's Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Aid for Venezuela's crisis has until now been focused on South American nations that have received most of the 3 million Venezuelans who have left the country amid a mass exodus since 2015. CERF's website shows it has provided $6.2 million for ""Venezuela's Regional Refugee and Migration Crisis.""
Many governments have been wary of providing direct aid to Venezuela, where officials face sanctions from the United States and Europe for alleged wrongdoing including corruption, human rights abuses and drug trafficking.
""I celebrate them finally accepting aid,"" exiled opposition legislator Jose Manuel Olivares, a doctor and activist on health issues, said in a telephone interview, but added:

""This is a government of profoundly corrupt institutions, and (the funds) could end up in a public official's bank account in a tax haven"".

524,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2018 03:03PM ET</span>",Brazilian president-elect adds fifth military man to cabinet,"RIO DE JANEIRO/BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's right-wing president-elect Jair Bolsonaro on Monday picked retired General Carlos Alberto dos Santos Cruz as his minister in charge of political relations with Congress, adding a fifth military man to his cabinet.
Bolsonaro, a former army captain turned politician who surged to victory on a pledge to end years of corruption and rising violence, made the announcement in a Twitter post.
Moving to deliver on his law-and-order platform, Bolsonaro's choice for justice and public security, former anti-corruption judge Sergio Moro, said he would coordinate federal and state police forces to better fight organized crime and slow the growth of Brazil's powerful drug gangs that control swaths of cities.
Some Brazilians are concerned that the appointment of Santos Cruz, who led United Nations peacekeepers in Haiti and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and other current or former military officials marks a return to a militarized government. Bolsonaro takes office on Jan. 1.
Seeking to defuse those concerns, Bolsonaro, a fan of the 1964-85 military dictatorship, has vowed to adhere to Brazil's constitution and has moderated some of his more extreme views expressed during almost three decades as a federal congressman.
Bolsonaro, who has long been a critic of the socialist government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, again appeared to tone down his strident views on regional migration, saying that Venezuelans fleeing to Brazil could not be returned to their country ""because they are not merchandise.""
In comments to reporters on the weekend, he also floated the idea of creating a refugee camp for Venezuelans in the northern border state of Roraima, while defending strict checks on who enters ""because there are some people we don't want in Brazil.""
A nongovernmental organization working on the Venezuelan exodus into Brazil said refugee camps were an ""extreme option"" for war zone areas and would worsen the plight of the immigrants.
""The camps would be far from urban areas and the Venezuelans want to be in urban areas to be able to rebuild their lives,"" said Camila Asano of Conectas rights group. 
She said the crisis has subsided in Roraima where there are 6,000 Venezuelans in shelters and the number living on the streets was down to 600.
Asano said, however, that a Brazilian Air Force airlift to move Venezuelans out of Roraima and to larger cities appeared to have slowed down.
In Brasilia, where Bolsonaro's transition team is preparing to govern, Moro told reporters that he will create a secretariat of police operations to coordinate all Brazil's security efforts by federal and state police forces to curb violence in the country that has more murders than any other.
Brazilian states have control over nearly all the police forces in the country, and Moro underscored he would respect their sovereignty.

But he said federal coordination was badly needed to improve street policing across Brazil and to tame the country's overcrowded prisons, which are under the control of drug gangs who recruit from jail and where bloody uprisings are rampant.

Nelson Chamisa lost the July 30 poll to President Emmerson Mnangagwa, in the first election after Robert Mugabe was forced to resign following a coup in November 2017. In the aftermath of the vote, civilians died in an army crackdown on protests.
Chamisa lost a legal challenge to the election results but still maintains the vote was rigged and that Mnangagwa lacks legitimacy. 
""For the record, my hands are clean. My conscience is very clear and my resolve is unbreakable. These hands that you see have not spilled blood,"" the 40-year-old politician said.
Chamisa said his party had not called for the protests and the demonstrations could have been hijacked by the ruling party to smear his party.
The commission of inquiry, led by former South African president Kgalema Motlante, has heard evidence from security chiefs who denied soldiers had killed civilians and blamed Chamisa and other opposition leaders for inciting violence.
Video from the Aug. 1 protests showed soldiers, some with their faces obscured by camouflage masks, opening fire with automatic weapons.

Chamisa said his party would hold peaceful protests on Thursday against a deteriorating economy, which he said was a result of lack of confidence in Mnangagwa's government.

The clash occurred in the southerwestern of town of Rukungiri, home to the country's main opposition figure, Kizza Besigye, a veteran rival to President Yoweri Museveni. 
A police spokesman said ""necessary"" force was used in the incident in which 15 people were arrested.
Pictures and footage posted on social media by Ronald Muhinda, an aide to Besigye, showed plumes of smoke from exploding teargas canisters, fires lit in the middle of the roads and anti-riot police vehicles on the town's streets. 
Muhinda said police had also used live rounds. Other posts by various social media users also showed teargas and heavy police deployment in the town.
Opposition supporters in the East African nation regularly clash with police and military personnel, both of whom are accused by critics of being used to crack down on opponents of long-ruling Museveni, 74. 
Police spokesman Patrick Onyango said they had arrested 15 people from the Forum For Democratic Change (FDC), Uganda's largest opposition party, whom he accused to attempting to stage an illegal meeting. 
When asked whether police had used teargas and live rounds, Onyango said: ""We used force that was necessary to match the level of resistance from the offenders,"" he said, adding the detained included Ingrid Turinawe, a senior official of FDC.
He declined to clarify what specific means of force had been used but accused the party of organizing the meeting without obtaining police's permission. 
Under Uganda's public order management laws, the police have sweeping powers to ban public gatherings for a range of reasons. 
In the footage, posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Muhinda said FDC had planned a thanksgiving and fundraising meeting in the town but that the police had blocked supporters from gathering at the venue and also blockaded Besigye at his home. 
Besigye could not be immediately reached for comment.
In power since 1986, Museveni is one of Africa's longest-serving leaders and is widely expected to seek re-election in 2021 when the next poll is due in the prospective oil producer. 
Last year, the ruling party-controlled parliament voted to remove the age cap from the constitution, a move critics say effectively cleared the way for a Museveni life presidency.

Alipur, an anti-Taliban commander from the mainly Shi'ite Hazara minority, was detained in Kabul weeks after an earlier attempt to arrest him in the western province of Ghor ended in a shootout in which at least 12 people were killed.
His arrest set off two days of protests in which dozens of police were wounded by rocks, at least eight security checkpoints and recruiting centers were burned and 19 vehicles damaged, according to the interior ministry.
""A consultation meeting took place today and it was agreed to release him if he guarantees that he won't break the law again,"" said a senior government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media.
Alipur's release, as President Ashraf Ghani flew to Geneva to attend a United Nations-sponsored development conference on Afghanistan, was confirmed by the office of Vice President Sarwar Danish.
The decision to let Alipur go underlines the struggle Afghanistan's Western-backed government has had in reining in politically-connected militia commanders that operate outside its control. It also highlights the risk of fragmentation along ethnic and sectarian lines in Afghanistan, even as hopes have been raised of a possible start to peace talks with the Taliban.
""It is very sad to see people like Alipur bailed out and the government succumbing to pressure,"" one security official said.
""It is going to turn into a pattern where even if the security forces arrest a wanted criminal, the government just frees them,"" he said. ""Security forces will lose faith in the government.""
Alipur, known widely as ""Commander Sword"", was accused of serious abuses mainly against ethnic Pashtuns in the Maidan Wardak region, west of Kabul.
However like many other militia strongmen, he has enjoyed high-level political backing that enabled him to defy attempts to arrest him. He also has wide support among Hazaras, many embittered by what they see as government inaction following a string of attacks on Shi'ite targets by the radical Sunni Islamic State group.

PORT BLAIR/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A rights organization urged Indian police on Monday to call off efforts to recover the body of an American missionary believed to have been killed by an isolated tribe on a remote island due to the risk of introducing them to diseases.
John Allen Chau, 26, is believed to have been killed last week after traveling to North Sentinel - part of the Indian archipelago of Andaman and Nicobar in the Bay of Bengal - to try to convert the tribe to Christianity. 
Indian police are working with anthropologists and psychologists to see if a plan can be forged to recover the body of Chau, an officer said on Monday.
But Survival International, a body that campaigns for the rights of indigenous tribals, said the attempts were dangerous for the Indian officials as well as the Sentinelese, who face being ""wiped out"" if any outside diseases were introduced.
""The risk of a deadly epidemic of flu, measles or other outside disease is very real, and increases with every such contact,"" they said.
The Sentinelese, generally considered the last pre-Neolithic tribe in the world, have violently resisted any contact with outsiders. The Indian government has for years placed the island off-limits to visitors to protect the tribe. 
""We are in constant touch with anthropologists and psychologists,"" said Dependra Pathak, director general of police in the Andaman and Nicobar islands. 
""If they suggest any methodology to interact without disturbing them then we can draw (up a) strategy,"" he said. ""At this stage we don't have any plan to confront our Sentinelese.""
A group of anthropologists, journalists and activists said in a joint statement that continuing with the efforts to recover Chau's body could lead to further violence and ""completely unwarranted loss of life"".
""The rights and the desires of the Sentinelese need to be respected and nothing is to be achieved by escalating the conflict and tension, and worse, to creating a situation where more harm is caused,"" they said.
Chau, who described himself in social media posts as an adventurer and explorer, made several trips to the island by canoe on Nov. 15.

KABUL/GENEVA (Reuters) - Afghan leaders and international diplomats meet in Geneva on Tuesday to evaluate whether strategies and aid offered to Afghanistan are helping resolve the quagmire created by the 17-year war, paving way for the withdrawal of foreign troops.
The two-day conference on Afghanistan, jointly hosted by the Afghan government and the United Nations comes at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is actively seeking a peace deal with the Taliban.
While no fresh financial commitments are expected, the conference will be a chance for donors to measure results against the $15.2 billion committed for Afghanistan at the last funding meeting in Brussels in 2016.
""At least 60 percent of all the promises made by President Ghani at Brussels have been implemented. Discussions will be held regarding the challenges,"" said Haroon Chakhansuri, President Ashraf Ghani's spokesman.
With Afghan security forces struggling to hold back increasingly confident Taliban fighters and Western appetite for further commitments uncertain, the conference comes at a sensitive moment.
The government will present a growth strategy mapping out how an economy battered by 40 years of war can one day stand on its own as well as pledges on issues ranging from fighting corruption to women's empowerment.
However diplomats said much of the focus will be on side meetings, where officials from Afghanistan and regional and Western countries will have a chance to assess the efforts of U.S. peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad.
Ghani, facing a war-weary public at home, is expected to press regional countries to support the process but he has so far been kept on the sidelines by the Taliban's refusal to talk to his government, which they consider illegitimate.
His own future will be decided by presidential elections due in April but organizational and political problems may hamper the vote with authorities admitting they are considering a delay of three months.
The Taliban, fighting to drive out international forces and establish their version of strict Islamic law, will not be attending but will be closely monitoring the talks.
""We hope the international leaders accept our demands and put pressure on the U.S. to withdraw all foreign forces from Afghanistan,"" said a Taliban member. ""Otherwise the conference will hold little significance.""
The United States currently has some 14,000 troops in Afghanistan, serving in the NATO-led Resolute Support training and advisory mission as well as in separate counter-terrorism operations against militant groups like Islamic State.

President Donald Trump has threatened to bar companies that continue to do business with Iran from the U.S. market.
Qatar Airways will add two weekly flights to its existing Doha-Tehran route and add three weekly flights on its Shiraz service in January. It will also launch two weekly flights to Isfahan in February. 
“These latest launches are further evidence of Qatar Airways’ commitment to Iran, as well as the expansion of our network in this thriving market ...,"" Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker said in a statement.
European carriers Air France and British Airways halted flights to Iran this year. Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways has also stopped flying to Iran, while Dubai's Emirates and flydubai have consolidated some routes as part of a partnership led by their shared state owner. 
Washington announced on Nov. 5 a series of sanctions targeting Iran's banks, oil and shipping sectors, national airline and 200 individuals after Trump pulled the United States out of an international nuclear deal with Tehran.
The United Arab Emirates, a U.S. partner in the Gulf region that staunchly opposes Iranian foreign policy and swiftly backed Washington's decision, has said it is fully complying with the sanctions.
The sanctions are aimed at forcing Iran to further curb its nuclear work, to suspend its ballistic missile program and its influence in the Middle East.
Qatar has forged closer economic ties with Iran since June 2017 when neighbors Saudi Arabia and the UAE cut political and economic ties with Doha, accusing it of supporting terrorism and cozying up to Tehran. Qatar denies the charges.

Egypt and Bahrain also cut ties with Qatar.

YALOVA, Turkey (Reuters) - Turkish police searched a remote villa in a coastal area southeast of Istanbul on Monday as part of the investigation into the killing last month of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, officials said.
Authorities believe that one of the Saudi agents allegedly involved in the murder at the kingdom's Istanbul consulate, Mansour Othman Abahussain, called the villa's owner a day before the killing, the Istanbul chief prosecutor's office said.
The owner of the property is a Saudi national, Mohammed Ahmed Alfaozan, who had the codename ""Ghozan"", it said. Two officials told Reuters that Alfaozan had purchased the property, near Yalova on the Sea of Marmara, around three years ago.
The phone call was believed to be about the destruction or disappearance of the body parts, the prosecutor's office said.
Police used sniffer dogs to search the garden of the villa and the nearby wooded area, according to Reuters cameramen at the scene. Officials told Reuters last month that Khashoggi's killers may have dumped his remains at a rural location near Yalova, which is a 90-km (55 mile) drive southeast of Istanbul.
They had halted the search on Monday evening.
Authorities have previously carried out inspections at the kingdom's consulate and the consul general's residence in Istanbul as part of an investigation into the killing of the journalist, a Washington Post columnist and a prominent critic of the Saudi government.
Khashoggi's killing has strained Saudi Arabia's ties with the West and battered the image overseas of its de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
Saudi Arabia has said the prince had no prior knowledge of the murder. After offering numerous contradictory explanations, Riyadh later said Khashoggi had been killed and his body dismembered when negotiations to persuade him to return to Saudi Arabia failed.
Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan has said the killing was ordered by the highest level of Saudi leadership but probably not from King Salman, putting the spotlight instead on the 33-year-old crown prince.

U.S. President Donald Trump said last week Washington would remain a ""steadfast partner"" of Saudi Arabia despite saying that Prince Mohammed may have known about the plan to murder Khashoggi.

(Reuters) - Chile is returning a second planeload of Haitian immigrants to their native country on Monday and will make use of the return flight from the Caribbean island to bring home Chileans stranded in crisis-stricken Venezuela.
After dropping off nearly 180 Haitian citizens in the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince, the Chilean air force plane will stop in Caracas to pick up nearly 100 Chileans and fly them back to Santiago, interior minister Andres Chadwick told reporters.
As oil-rich Venezuela's economy has sunk into crisis under President Nicolas Maduro, as many as 1.9 million Venezuelans have emigrated since 2015, according to the United Nations.
""This will be a humanitarian flight on the way there, and on the way back,"" Chadwick said.
A total of 1,600 Haitians have signed up for the flights back to Haiti from Chile, part of a program labeled as ""humanitarian flights"" by the government of center-right President Sebastian Pinera but criticized by migrant groups as ""forced deportations."" 
The policy is aimed at Haitians who have struggled to find work in one of Latin America's richest economies, in some cases lured to the Andean nation by people traffickers with false promises. 
Earlier this month, 176 Haitians returned to Haiti aboard another Chilean air force flight.
The cost-free return trip requires those leaving to sign a declaration that they will not return for nine years, and asks they take immediate family with them. 
The policy has generated controversy among some migrant groups, rights campaigners and academics. Haiti is one of the world's poorest countries, blighted by natural disasters, political upheaval and poor security. 
Chile's government has said that there are approximately 112,000 Haitians in Chile, or about 10 percent of the total immigrant population.

Wearing a white hard hat, Salvini, who heads the League party, boarded a digger and knocked a small chunk from the roof of the villa before the Italian army took over to finish the job. 
The villa property will be converted into a children's playground, Salvini said. Just last week, eight other villas belonging to the Casamonica mob family clan were confiscated.
Speaking to dozens of reporters and cameras, Salvini promised that he will chase criminals ""neighborhood by neighborhood, street by street, villa by villa and shop by shop"".
In July, 33 members of the group - which is involved in loan sharking, extortion, and the drugs trade - were arrested in raids on gaudy properties which were filled with gilded mirrors, marbled sculptures of animals and extravagant, regal furniture.
Salvini has promised to take a hard line against organized crime and irregular immigration since taking over the ministry in June, and he has railed against Roma camps for years, promising to bulldoze them. 

Called ""the Captain"" by his supporters, Salvini posted on Twitter a video of him aboard the digger that said: ""The captain activates the bulldozer!""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Maldives' new finance minister said on Monday that China is executing infrastructure projects at vastly higher prices than originally proposed but the island nation cannot get out of its commitments now.
President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih's administration, which took office this month, is reviewing contracts awarded by his predecessor Abdulla Yameen. Most went to Chinese firms and are feared to have left the country in debt.
During a five-year building spree, China built a sea bridge connecting the capital city of Male to the main airport on another island and is developing the airport itself as well as building mass housing on land reclaimed from the sea.
But Finance Minister Ibrahim Ameer told reporters during a visit to New Delhi that his officials had spend the first week in office trying to reconcile loans that the previous government took for these projects and the sovereign guarantees that it gave for them. 
""We believe that most of these projects are at inflated prices, and so we are looking at them,"" Ameer said.
But he said the government could not go back on the contracts because many of these, including the bridge, were already completed.
""We cannot do much in terms of renegotiation but going forward our objective would be to reduce the cost of our infrastructure projects,"" he said. 
One of the projects was a hospital in Male awarded to China which had already run up a cost $140 million, far more than a rival offer $54 million that was originally made, Ameer said. 
China has built ports, bridges and highways in countries stretching from Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and its ally Pakistan as part of its Belt and Road Initiative for a trade and transit corridor across Asia and into Europe. 
But of late it has faced criticism that many of its massive projects costing millions of dollars are pushing the smaller countries into debt. 
India, which has been traditional partner for most of the South Asian countries, has in addition viewed the expansive Chinese diplomacy as aimed at securing an outpost in some of the island nations such as Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
Maldives' foreign minister Abdulla Shahid said he had assured Indian leaders that his country wanted the best of ties with its immediate neighbors and would return to an ""India First"" policy.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended Solih's inauguration and said India stood ready to help the country tide over its financial difficulties.
China has rejected allegations it was driving the Maldives to debt and said it hopes the new government will continue with policies to attract investment.

537,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2018 10:40AM ET</span>",Lebanon rejects Russian military aid offer,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon this month turned down a long-standing offer of Russian military aid that had caused concern for the United States, a major backer of the Lebanese army, a senior Lebanese political source told Reuters.
""The rejection came on the pretext that Lebanon does not need these kinds of weapons and ammunition, but the reason was maybe because of U.S. pressure,"" the source said, confirming a report in Lebanese daily al-Akhbar.
The source said Lebanon spurned the offer, which had been made early this year, earlier this month.
The United States is the biggest donor to the Lebanese army, providing more than $1.5 billion in support since 2006. 
The United States says the support has aimed to strengthen the army as ""the sole"" military force defending Lebanon - where the heavily armed Iran-backed group Hezbollah holds major sway - and to counter threats from neighboring Syria.
Western diplomats have said that Lebanon accepting the Russian offer would be problematic for Washington and its Western allies.
Russian forces are widely deployed in neighboring Syria, where they have been fighting in support of President Bashar al-Assad since 2015 alongside Iran-backed groups including Hezbollah - which is listed as a terrorist group by Washington. 
Under a 2017 law, the United States can impose sanctions on countries that engage in ""significant transactions"" with the Russian military. 
The United States has been increasing pressure on Russia globally through sanctions in recent years over actions including its role in annexing Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014, a nerve agent attack in Britain, allegations of meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, and its role in Syria.
Exact details of the size of the Russian offer are not known.
In February the Russian government published a draft military accord between Russia and Lebanon. The five-year renewable agreement included general aspirations of improving information exchanges, developing military training and fighting terrorism. 
Local media and a Western diplomat early this year said Russia was offering a $1 billion line of credit to the Lebanese military for arms and other military purchases.

541,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2018 08:55AM ET</span>",Stopping Brexit? EU's top court hears UK exit reversal case,"By Michael Holden
LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's top court will hold an urgent hearing on Tuesday over whether Britain can unilaterally reverse its decision to leave the EU, in a case supporters of membership hope could pave the way to a second referendum and ultimately stop Brexit.
The European Court of Justice (ECJ) is being asked to interpret whether Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - the mechanism by which Britain notified the European Union of its intention to leave - can be revoked.
Britain is due to exit the world's biggest trading bloc on March 29 next year but it remains unclear whether British Prime Minister Theresa May's draft withdrawal deal agreed with the EU on Sunday will be passed by parliament.
She has warned Britain could leave without a deal or that there could be no Brexit at all. That latter statement has given added significance to the outcome of the case before the ECJ - whose supremacy over UK legal matters May has cited as one reason to leave the EU. 
If it concludes Britain can unilaterally reverse Brexit, it could give British lawmakers (MPs) a third viable option as an alternative to May's deal or what ministers describe as a chaotic no deal scenario - staying in the bloc after another referendum.
The British government has fought to stop the ECJ hearing the case, saying it is irrelevant because ministers have no intention of reversing Brexit, while May has consistently ruled out a second referendum. 
""Theresa May wants to blackmail us into voting for her bad deal by thinking the only alternative is the disaster of crashing out with no deal,"" Joanna Cherry, a Scottish National Party lawmaker and one of the group of Scottish politicians who instigated the case told Reuters.
""We say (Article 50) can be unilaterally revoked - whether that's the case or whether the court just says it can be revoked with permission - we've got the answers that we need in order as members of parliament to be able to say there is a concrete option of stopping Brexit."" 
EXPEDITED
The case was referred to the Luxembourg justices for a ruling by Scotland's top court and in a demonstration of its importance it has been ""expedited"" by the ECJ for Tuesday's one-day hearing before a full court of judges.
Article 50 states that if a state decides to withdraw, it has two years to agree an exit deal with the remaining 27 EU members, although this process can be extended if the European Council unanimously agrees.
There is no mention of whether a state can change its mind. No other member state has ever left the 60-year-old bloc.
However, John Kerr, the British diplomat who drafted the clause, has repeatedly argued that it can be unilaterally reversed.
""The die is not irrevocably cast, there is still time and, until the UK has left the EU, the Article 50 letter can be withdrawn,"" he wrote in a recent pamphlet.
Other legal experts are unconvinced, arguing costs already incurred by the other EU states from divorce talks and the clause's focus on protecting the interests of its remaining members meant it could not be reversed solely at the UK's whim.

It is not clear when the ECJ will give its ruling but Cherry was optimistic it would come before British lawmakers vote on the deal which is expected in mid-December.

542,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2018 08:50AM ET</span>",Iraq militia leader urges formal border security role for Shi'ite fighters,"By John Davison
NAJAF, Iraq (Reuters) - The head of a powerful Iraqi militia wants a formal role for Shi'ite paramilitaries in securing the border with Syria, a move that could deepen U.S. worries about Iran's growing sway over a strategic corridor of territory from Tehran to Beirut.
Iraq's Shi'ite militias, many of which are supported by Iran and oppose the presence of U.S. troops in the region, have sent reinforcements to the frontier after fighting flared between U.S.-backed Kurdish forces and Islamic State militants on the Syrian side.
Qais al-Khazali, the leader of Iranian-backed Asaib Ahl al-Haq, urged the government to provide a more formal, long-term border protection role for the militias.
    ""Securing Iraq's borders with Syria is among the most important duties of the Popular Mobilization Forces right now,"" he said in an interview with Reuters at his office in the Shi'ite holy city of Najaf on Saturday.
    ""The Daesh (IS) threat against Iraq won't end as long as Syria is unstable. The PMF proved it is the military side most capable of dealing with Daesh ... maybe the armed forces can invest the PMF in duties that include border security,"" Khazali said. 
Asaib Ahl al-Haq is part of the PMF, an umbrella grouping of mostly Iran-backed and trained Shi'ite paramilitary groups. The PMF was made formally part of the security forces this year after helping the military defeat Islamic State in Iraq in 2017.
    It remains separate from the military and police, however, raising questions over whom the militias will answer to and what their exact role will be if they are fully integrated into Iraq's security structure.
Khazali said paramilitary commanders should retain leadership positions and that ""the government needs to provide bases and weapons depots.""
The growing presence of Iran-backed militias on the frontier has caused tensions with Washington, which has special forces on the Syrian side to back Kurdish-led fighters battling IS. 
A formal PMF border role would exacerbate that friction as Washington seeks to counter Iran's sway over territory stretching from Tehran to the Mediterranean via Iraq and Syria. Iran's allies in that territory include Iraqi and Lebanese fighters and politicians, and Syria's President Bashar al-Assad.
    The risks of having Shi'ite fighters and U.S. forces in close proximity were laid bare in July when the PMF vowed to ""not be quiet"" over an alleged U.S. air strike it said killed 22 of its members inside Syria.
    The United States denied involvement in the strike.
    The Iraqi military, which Washington supports, is deployed along the frontier, but PMF leaders have said they are taking the lead in securing it, including around the town of al-Qaim which borders Syria's Deir al-Zor province.
    ""The border was not secure before. Our operations have fixed that completely,"" a senior PMF commander said in October.
   Iraq's military relied on the PMF support to defeat IS. It says the militias are now crucial to securing the sprawling Syrian border.
Iraqi Sunni and Kurdish politicians have called for disarming the PMF. They say the militias are responsible for widespread abuses including extra-judicial killings and displacing non-Shi'ite populations, and in effect report to Tehran, not the government in Baghdad.
    The PMF says any abuses were isolated incidents and not systematic and that those who committed them have been punished.
U.S. TROOP PRESENCE 'UNACCEPTABLE'
The PMF, estimated at 150,000 members, includes groups which fought the U.S. military after the 2003 invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, and individuals against whom Washington has imposed Iran-related sanctions.
    Members of Congress have sought sanctions against Khazali's group. Khazali denied it is currently receiving support from Iran.
    ""We don't expect a good future for relations between Iraq and the United States under (President Donald) Trump,"" he said, and reiterated his call for U.S. troops to leave Iraq.
    ""A (U.S.) training role is one thing but presence of combat forces is unacceptable. Parliament should oppose this. Daesh is no longer a military threat, so there should be a reduction"" in U.S. troops, he said.
    The Pentagon says over 5,000 troops are deployed in Iraq.
Khazali's militia started as a splinter group of the Mahdi Army, a force formed by anti-American Shi'ite leader Moqtada al-Sadr in the U.S. occupation. Under his leadership, it gained notoriety for its attacks against U.S. forces.
    He and Hadi al-Amiri, the veteran leader of the Badr Organisation who contested Iraq's May general election, were among the first to announce late last year they were putting their paramilitaries under the orders of the prime minister.

Iran has provided training and weapons to both groups.

In a speech last week, EFF leader Julius Malema said Gordhan's daughter Anisha was awarded government contracts as a result of her father's position in government. Gordhan denies any wrongdoing, and also says his daughter is not corrupt.
The case between Gordhan and Malema could open a new avenue of political jostling between the parties months before a national election, where the smaller EFF is trying to use an anti-corruption platform to challenge key figures in the ruling African National Congress party.
Gordhan, a former finance minister respected by international investors for standing up to former president Jacob Zuma, filed a complaint of crimen injuria and criminal defamation and asked the police to investigate any incitement to violence contained in Malema's speech.
Crimen injuria is an act of unlawfully, intentionally and seriously impairing the dignity of another.
Gordhan also laid another complaint at the Equality Court, seeking an apology from Malema and his deputy Floyd Shivambu, as well as damages of 150,000 rand ($11,000).
""The determined defense of corruption and the corrupt, using personal attacks, racism and alleged hate speech is not acceptable and must be challenged,"" Gordhan said.
""I have not responded until now to the absolute nonsensical and unsubstantiated attacks, but extending these attacks to my family and threatening harmony amongst the people of South Africa was a step too far. Enough is enough.""
The EFF spokesman did not answer calls to his mobile phone seeking comment on Gordhan's complaint. An official at the party's headquarters said the EFF leaders were meeting and could issue a statement later.
Malema tweeted that he would open a criminal case against Gordhan on Tuesday on charges ranging from money laundering, corruption, racketeering to fraud. He did not provide details. 
Malema made the allegations against Gordhan last week at an EFF rally held outside a building where Gordhan was giving testimony at a judicial inquiry into allegations of state corruption and influence-peddling in Zuma's administration.
Zuma has denied the allegations. The allegations and other scandals surrounding Zuma's nine-year rule forced him out of office in February.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia said on Monday it was planning for a U.S. deployment of new nuclear missiles in Europe following Washington’s planned withdrawal from a landmark Cold war-era arms control treaty despite the United States denying it has such plans. 
Russia is keen to dissuade U.S. President Donald Trump from carrying out a threat for Washington to quit the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty which eliminated both countries’ land-based short- and intermediate-range nuclear missiles from Europe.
Both countries accuse each other of violating the 1987 treaty and President Vladimir Putin and Trump are due to discuss the matter at the G20 in Argentina later this month.
Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told a news conference on Monday that Moscow wanted to save the treaty and was open to talks on the issue with Washington.
But Ryabkov, who accused the United States of violating the accord with missile deployments in Poland and Romania, said he thought the chances of a change of heart were slim and said Russia's military planners were prepared for such a scenario.
A SKEPTICAL MOSCOW
NATO’s top official said in October he did not believe there would be new deployments of U.S. missiles in Europe and U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton said Washington was a long way from taking decisions about deploying missiles in Europe.
Ryabkov said Moscow was skeptical about assertions from U.S. and NATO officials that no such new missiles would be deployed.
""We hear (the denials) but nothing more,"" said Ryabkov. ""Plans have been changed many times before. We don't want to be disappointed in our (U.S.) colleagues again and therefore we are assuming the worst case scenario in our military planning.""
Ryabkov said he believed the United States would be able to deploy intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe ""within years,"" something he said would fuel a dangerous arms race.
""We can't ignore the potential deployment of new American missiles on territory from where they will be a threat to Russia and its allies,"" the TASS news agency cited him as saying. 
""In the event of such a deployment the Americans would gain significant extra capabilities, allowing them to strike at targets deep inside Russia.""
Putin has previously said that Russia would be forced to target any European countries that agreed to host U.S. nuclear missiles.
Ryabkov said it was too early to speak about specific military retaliatory steps, but said Moscow's response would be ""effective"" and ""relatively inexpensive.""

RAQQA, Syria (Reuters) - In the Syrian city of Raqqa, children wear hats, scarves and coats to guard against the winter cold as they struggle to catch up on years of lost learning in a classroom with no doors or glazed windows.
More than a year since the United States and its allies defeated Islamic State at Raqqa, many of the city's schools still look like battlefields with buildings left lying in rubble and playgrounds dotted with wrecked cars.
""When the crisis started, we stopped studying, the schools closed. Now we've come back to study and we need help. Fix the windows, doors, we're dying of cold,"" said 12-year-old Abdullah al-Hilal at Uqba bin Nafie school.
Islamic State, which turned Raqqa into the Syrian headquarters of its self-declared ""caliphate"", kept schools shut as it tried to impose its ultra-radical vision of Islam through its own education system.
Since Islamic State's defeat there in October 2017, 44 schools have reopened with 45,000 children enrolled, said Ali al-Shannan, the head of the education council set up by civilian authorities in Raqqa.
The children have lost out on five years of schooling.
""Very basic"" aid had allowed for some renovation work, covering only 10 percent of needs, Shannan told Reuters. The schools generally ""have no doors, no windows, in addition to the sanitation systems that are in a deplorable state"", he said.
At Uqba bin Nafie school, one classroom looks out onto a wrecked building, its floors collapsed on top of each other and a car flipped on its side nearby. In the yard, children stand around large pools of dirty water while others eat snacks by the crumpled wreckage of another vehicle.
AIR STRIKES
Islamic State used Raqqa's schools - like much of the city - for military purposes, digging tunnels under some of them. Some of the schools were hit by air strikes, Raqqa residents say. 
Amnesty International has said 80 percent of the city still lies in ruins, with thousands of bodies under the rubble. With much of Raqqa destroyed by U.S.-led air strikes, Amnesty has faulted the coalition for not doing more to help recovery.
The United States has said stabilization efforts in Raqqa have focused on basic necessities including demining, water and electricity. The coalition has also supported the reopening of schools.
UNICEF, the U.N. children's agency, estimates that 2.1 million children in Syria are out of school.
In Raqqa, UNICEF is providing textbooks to more than 121,000 children so they can get a start while waiting for a classroom, said Juliette Touma, UNICEF's regional chief of communications. ""The self-learning program allows children who are out of school to learn at home, an NGO or community learning center,"" she said.
Shannan said 57,000 books have been received so far, short of 95,000 he said had been requested. The need was growing as the number of children registered for school increases, he said.
As winter sets in, the dilapidated state of the schools is leading some children to miss out on yet more lessons.
Ayman al-Qurt, the director of at Uqba bin Nafie school, says attendance in one of his classes is just 11 of 38 pupils ""because of the bad state of the school and the bad weather"".

""Is this not a pity?""

Assoumani's attempt to extend limits on presidential terms and run in polls expected in early 2019 has provoked clashes on the archipelago's Anjouan island. 
The speaker of parliament called off on Saturday a vote on a legal amendment empowering Assoumani to pass laws by presidential decree for three months. Government ministers stayed away when it became clear that 21 out of the 33 members of parliament (MPs) opposed the move. 
""If President Azali failed to convince the 21 opposing MPs, how will he convince the people in the presidential elections? We will keep the fight for the respect of our institution and against the illegality,"" Oumouri Mmadi Hassani, spokesman for the 21 lawmakers, told reporters.
Assoumani has said a referendum in June approved the extension of term limits and an end to a system under which the presidency is rotated among the country's three main islands. The opposition declared the vote illegal.
Assoumani has been in power since 2016 and would have had to step down in 2021 under the old term limits. However, if he were to win another five-year term in 2019, this would mean he remained in office after 2021 when a candidate from Anjouan is supposed to take up the presidency under the rotating system.
Last month, the unrest worsened with government officials saying soldiers shot dead two people and wounded four in violence between masked men and the military in Anjouan's capital Mutsamudu.

""President Azali cannot be a candidate in the presidential elections and therefore wants the MPs to allow him to dictate alone the laws that will govern these elections,"" Mohamed Ali Soilih, leader of the national opposition, said in a statement on Saturday.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Chinese state media heaped pressure on Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen on Monday after her ruling pro-independence party suffered heavy defeats in local elections at the weekend, as party officials sought to work out what went wrong.
Tsai, who faces a presidential election in a little over a year, resigned on Saturday as chairwoman of the Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP) after losing key battleground cities in mayoral polls to the China-friendly Kuomintang. 
The DPP now only controls six cities and counties to the Kuomintang's 15.
Han Kuo-yu, the Kuomintang's mayor-elect in the southern port city of Kaohsiung, and the most high profile of the party's winners, said he would open the door to contacts with China.
Beijing has refused to deal with Tsai's administration since she took office in 2016, accusing her of pushing for the island's formal independence. 
That is a red line for China, which considers the democratic island sacred Chinese territory.
Tsai has said she wants to maintain the status quo with China but will defend Taiwan's security and democracy, especially in the face of ramped up Chinese pressure such as whittling down Taiwan's dwindling band of diplomatic allies. 
In the run-up to the elections, Tsai had warned against Chinese efforts to interfere and urged that people must stand up for democracy.
The official China Daily said in an editorial Tsai had ignored Beijing's ""cooperative stance"" and forced relations into a deadlock, and that ""her separatist stance has lost her the support of the people on the island"".
""Cross-Straits communication and cooperation between local governments are expected to be strengthened as a result of the election, which will bring more opportunities and help deepen mutual understanding,"" it wrote.
The Kuomintang has sent delegations to China since Tsai took office, where they have been warmly received, and that contact is now likely to increase.
Hung Mong-kai, a Kuomintang spokesman, said he was ""certain"" there would now be more interaction with China. 
'NO EXCUSES'
Chiu Chui-cheng, deputy minister of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, told Reuters the government had always welcomed exchanges with China, but Beijing's ""political preconditions"" had hindered such contacts. 
""We are always positive on city-to-city exchanges with mainland China, but it's them who set a limit: they treat blue and green differently,"" he said, referring to the colors representing the Kuomintang and DPP. 
Another state-run Chinese paper, the widely read tabloid the Global Times, said in an editorial that the DPP's ""radical thinking"" had led it astray, though the same paper last week had called Tsai's China policies ""measured"".
Close Tsai aide Chen Chu, secretary general of the presidential office, said there were ""no excuses"" for the poor performance and that they had to think deeply.
""The one who really needs to change is me,"" Tsai wrote on her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, adding that the administration would take a thorough look at major policies and personnel. She did not elaborate.
Senior DPP member and legislator Lo Chih-cheng told Reuters the party had failed to please anyone with its moderate approach to both China and domestic issues, and the DPP needed a re-think and maybe a more radical agenda to reach its core supporters.
""The party is in turmoil,"" Lo said, suggesting one way to please people would be to try to win back some of the smaller countries with which China has ties.
""We've been pushed into a corner, without fighting back. And that again disappointed our supporters,"" he said.
Still, Taiwan's stock market (TWII) was cheered by the Kuomintang's gains, on expectations of better ties with China, closing up more than one percent. The Taiwan dollar  also strengthened. 
China has done little to hide its glee at the DPP's poor showing.

One source with ties to China's leadership, asked how Beijing felt about the outcome, told Reuters simply: ""They're really happy.""

PARIS (Reuters) - A full peace deal between North and South Korea may remain elusive, but the neighbors took a cultural step forward on Monday when they joined forces to get their ancient wrestling tradition onto a U.N. list of cultural treasures.
Ssirum in North Korea or Ssireum in South Korea has a history stretching back around 1,800 years, but still draws huge audiences with national and international contests broadcast on television.
On Monday, the sport was added to the U.N. cultural agency's list of so called ""intangible assets"" after a month of shuffle diplomacy by UNESCO between North and South Korea, both of whom initially made separate bids.
""This joint inscription marks a highly symbolic step on the road to inter-Korean reconciliation. It reminds us of the peace-building power of cultural heritage,"" UNESCO chief Audrey Azoulay said. 
The cultural diplomats had to get round a few obstacles - including a letter's difference in the transliteration of the sport's name into English.
But the countries eventually settled on the classification: 'traditional Korean wrestling (ssirum/ssireum)' - with the North's version listed first as it had made the first application.
TENSIONS
The entry describes it as a contest in a circular ring, where the wrestlers start by kneeling and grabbing a belt - known as a satba or satpa - wrapped around the opponent's waist and thigh.
The winner is the first to force ""the other contestant to touch the ground with any part of his body at knee level or higher,"" reads the officially agreed description.
Tensions over North Korea's tests of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles spiked on the Korean peninsular last year and there were fears of a U.S. military response to North Korea's threat to develop a weapon capable of hitting the United States.
Talks in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have allayed those concerns, and a detente between Pyongyang and Seoul has opened the door to closer ties.
""We're at a point where sanctions are still in place, we can't move forward on economic questions and much remains blocked. So in areas where UNESCO works, which aren't subjected to sanctions, we can push ahead quickly and with determination,"" said a UNESCO source.
The two nations have indicated they want to focus on what they can work together on, from heritage sites to education and science to sport, the UNESCO official said. 

""UNESCO is ready to play a supporting role,"" the source added.

Latvians, fed up with corruption and weak democracy in the Baltic country of 2 million, punished the ruling three-party coalition in the October election, leading to a highly fragmented parliament consisting of seven parties.
Gobzems, whose party is the second largest in parliament, is the second candidate to be given a chance to form a government after Janis Bordans of the New Conservative party failed to gather enough support earlier this month. 
""What I can promise today is that I will do everything I can for the rest of my life... so that Latvians can live in prosperity and harmony,"" said Gobzems, who has called for a shakeup of Latvian democracy.
Gobzems said he would seek to form a government with centre-right parties, excluding Russia-friendly party Harmony, but did not specify how many parties he would try to bring in.
President Raimonds Vejonis has given him until Dec. 10 to form a new coalition.
Latvia has long been plagued by corruption and moneylaundering.

Its central bank governor is awaiting trial on charges of accepting a bribe, which he denies. One of Latvia's biggest banks, ABLV, went into liquidation this year after U.S. authorities accused it of laundering vast amounts of money for people from the former Soviet Union.

The National Minimum Wage Act sets South Africa's minimum wage at 20 rand ($1.45) an hour, equal to 3,500 rand per month. The law will come into force on a date to be determined by Ramaphosa, the presidency said.
Supporters of the minimum wage say it will reduce inequality and stimulate economic growth as workers spend more. 
But critics say it could lead to increased unemployment, already at record highs, because some employers won't be able to afford higher wage bills.
Thousands of union members protested against the proposed minimum wage in April, saying it was too low.
Ramaphosa's office said in a statement that while the national minimum wage will not end income inequality, it was a first step towards adressing the clamor for a living wage.

COX'S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Rohingya refugees from Myanmar in camps in Bangladesh began a protest on Monday, demanding that Bangladesh recognize their ethnicity as Rohingya and that officials and aid agencies stop sharing their family information with Myanmar.
Markets were shut at several of the refugee camps in southeast Bangladesh because of the protest. Rohingya working with non-government groups and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees also boycotted their jobs as part of the strike.
""The term 'Rohingya' is very important because we have been persecuted because of our identity,"" the protesting refugees said in a statement, adding that while the term was banned in Myanmar, it should not be banned in Bangladesh.
More than 700,000 Muslim Rohingya fled a sweeping army crackdown in mostly Buddhist Myanmar's Rakhine State last year, according to U.N. agencies. The crackdown was launched in response to Rohingya insurgent attacks on security forces.
Rohingya regard themselves as native to western Myanmar's Rakhine State but Myanmar authorities and many citizens regard them as illegal immigrants from the Indian subcontinent.
Many are stateless as a 1982 law restricts citizenship for the Rohingya and other minorities not considered members of one of Myanmar's ""national races"".
The Myanmar government refuses even to use the word ""Rohingya"", as that would imply a distinct identify, instead calling them ""Bengali"".
Bangladesh has been urging the refugees to accept smart cards that help with identification and the distribution of aid. The smart cards however, identify an individual as a ""forcibly displaced Myanmar national"" and not as Rohingya.
The protesters also expressed concern about a UNHCR plan to collect biometric data and copies of documents, as they fear the UNHCR and Bangladeshi authorities could share the data with Myanmar, which could use the information against them. 
Bangladeshi authorities were not immediately reachable for comment. 
Firas Al-Khateeb, a UNHCR representative, said data was being collected for a verification process which would help Rohingya refugees get better protection and ensure their access to services in Bangladesh.
""It is not linked to repatriation,"" he said, adding that the data was jointly maintained by Bangladesh and the UNHCR.
Refugees are refusing to return to Myanmar under a repatriation plan unless demands for justice, citizenship and the ability to go back to their original villages and lands are met.
The refugees say they had to flee from their homes after Myanmar soldiers and Buddhist civilians massacred families, burned villages and carried out gang rapes.
U.N-mandated investigators have accused the Myanmar army of ""genocidal intent"" and ethnic cleansing.

Myanmar denies almost all the accusations, saying its forces engaged in a counter-insurgency operation against ""terrorists"".

In a statement, the military said the attacker was ""neutralized"", but did not give his condition. The Palestinian Health Ministry said the Palestinian man had died.
The military said one of the soldiers sustained moderate injuries and the other two were slightly hurt when a Palestinian rammed his vehicle into them as the troops were carrying out engineering work along a West Bank road, north of the city of Hebron.
Another soldier, on patrol, then shot the alleged assailant, the military said.
Palestinians carried out a wave of car-ramming attacks in the West Bank in late 2015 and in 2016, but the frequency of such incidents has since decreased.
Israel captured the West Bank in a 1967 Middle East war. Palestinians seek to establish a state there and in the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital. Israeli-Palestinian peace talks collapsed in 2014.

557,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2018 07:00AM ET</span>",Jordan faces wave of dissent as government's troubles mount,"By Tom Perry and Suleiman Al-Khalidi
AMMAN (Reuters) - When a flash flood swept a group of schoolchildren to their deaths in Jordan last month, a wave of public criticism pointed to wider discontent within the kingdom.
The backlash against the government on social media questioned how anyone had been allowed into an area at risk of seasonal flooding near the Dead Sea. Two ministers were sacked over the tragedy and King Abdullah ordered an inquiry. 
The reaction reflected the challenges facing a government struggling to win public support over a range of issues, chief amongst them tax increases needed to help plug the state's gaping budget deficit.
Criticism on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter has been running at a high pitch all year with little or no respite even after King Abdullah replaced the government in June following a rare wave of protests over the economy.
""Prison does not scare us and the word of justice we will say as long as we live. The country must get fixed,"" political satirist Ahmed Hassan Zoubi tweeted on Nov. 17.
King Abdullah's half brother, former crown prince Hamza, has also weighed in, taking to Twitter in September to demand a crackdown on corruption in the public sector as a starting point for reform - a call voiced by the king himself.
For Jordan, a U.S. ally whose stability has been a defining feature of the Middle East for decades, this has been an uncomfortable year.
The government has been forced to cut spending and raise taxes, confronted by the economic impact of years of regional turmoil and diminished Gulf Arab support as a result of falling oil prices and the Yemen war.
Adding to the pressures, Donald Trump's proposed Middle East peace plan has hit a political nerve in Jordan, where millions of citizens of Palestinian refugee origin live alongside native Jordanians.
Despite questions over whether the president's ""ultimate deal"" will get anywhere, his approach has stirred old fears of any attempt to settle the conflict in a way that would suit Israel but forgo Palestinian rights at Jordan's expense.
With its stability underpinned by a powerful military and security apparatus, Jordan has developed one of the Arab world's more open economies, investing in education and infrastructure including its gleaming airport and roads.
A bulwark against Islamist militancy, Jordan has made peace with Israel and absorbed waves of Palestinian, Iraqi and Syrian refugees. It also navigated its way through the 2011 Arab Spring, though it still faces some of the issues that ignited regional turmoil that year, notably youth unemployment. 
Since the summer protests, there has been no sign of unrest in the streets. King Abdullah and his Hashemite dynasty enjoy solid support and act as a unifying force among native Jordanian tribes and Jordanian Palestinians.
But not for the first time, the monarchy has come in for criticism of late.
KING ABDULLAH STEPS INTO DEBATE
In October, a group of retired senior military officers, tribal figures and activists from traditionally loyalist constituencies aired their grievances in a petition directed at King Abdullah.
Attacking Trump's Middle East policy, the signatories urged the king to stand firm against any moves that harm Jordan.
The king subsequently announced he would not be renewing a deal that has let Israelis farm Jordanian land near the border since the peace treaty of 1994 - a move that won approval at home and was seen aimed at defusing some of the anger.
The petition also included a call for the monarch to devolve more powers to parliament.
""Loyalty is overwhelming in Jordan but that doesn't mean there are no pockets here and there that are against even the monarchy. And they are negligible, yes, but through social media they will have a ... big voice,"" said Fayez Tarawneh, a pillar of the establishment who has served as prime minister and head of the royal court.
With the traditional print and broadcast media loyal to the state and no organized opposition political parties, social media has become a channel for dissent.
The government has launched a public awareness campaign on its dangers. ""Fabricated news obstructs development and confuses public opinion,"" declares one of the banners erected in recent days around Amman.
King Abdullah has stepped into the debate about its role in unusually strong terms, taking aim at what he described as false rumors and stories spread online in a lengthy article published in pro-government media.
Addressing speculation over a month-long absence this summer, the king criticized a ""wave of rumors and false stories"" that had spread concerning his annual break. ""The question persisted: Where is the king? Some went as far as questioning my presence even as I stood before them."" 
""Unfortunately, some people have tried to spread rumors targeting the morale and unity of Jordanians,"" he wrote.
There was an urgent need, he wrote, to develop laws to ensure the protection of freedom of expression but also to ""combat rumors and misinformation, and counter hate speech"".
""Anyone who offends a Jordanian — whether from my bigger Jordanian family or my immediate family — offends me personally.""
""NOT AN EASY RIDE""
Amnesty International said the article appeared to signal the king's support for proposed amendments to a cybercrimes law that would ""deal a devastating blow to freedom of expression in Jordan"". The amendments were sent to parliament in September.
""They are deeply scared of Facebook,"" said Ali Braizat, a dissident from the town of Dhiban who has been jailed twice for opposition activities.
Braizat, 55, is an unusually strident critic of King Abdullah, crossing red lines that allow criticism of the government but not the monarch.
His town is one of the provincial tribal areas upon which the Hashemites built their support among native Jordanians. Many of its people have benefited from state jobs, including Braizat until he resigned in 2001. Jordan's police chief is from the area.
Braizat's last spell in prison was in January, when he was held for one month. His arrest sparked protests in Dhiban.
Braizat, a lawyer who also farms olives on family land in Dhiban, was a signatory of the petition, describing it as a ""clear and frank"" message to the king and his foreign backers.
""The Jordanians are telling the king what's requested of (him),"" he said. ""In the midst of what's going on in the region we don't want to change the regime. But (he is) the one in charge and responsible firstly and finally for changing things.""
During the Arab Spring, there were protests in Dhiban but these were to demand more state jobs and services, not political reform, Braizat said. A visit by King Abdullah helped manage the situation.
Jordan's financial crunch now hangs over the state's ability to finance jobs and services. Tarawaneh said the ""financial squeeze"" couldn't be separated from regional instability.
""What is needed really is continuous dialogue within the country to explain more ... the procedures the government has to take. In certain areas, you need some surgery,"" he said.

""It's not an easy ride.""

The EU hosted the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, Ali Akbar Salehi, at a seminar on nuclear cooperation aimed at showing its continuing support for the deal after U.S. sanctions targeting Iranian oil exports resumed this month.
The EU and other remaining signatories to the accord hope to convince Tehran to respect the curbs that the deal placed on its nuclear program even though Washington has pulled out, depriving Iran of many of the economic benefits.
""If words are not turned into deeds, then ... it is very ominous, the situation would be unpredictable,"" Salehi told reporters at the conference.
Salehi, however, said he believed the EU was ""doing its best"" and was on its way to delivering on its promises.
EU efforts to salvage trade relations with Tehran, including by establishing a special mechanism for non-dollar transactions, have been floundering.
The Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) would act as a kind of clearing house that could be used to help match Iranian oil and gas exports against purchases of EU goods in an effective barter arrangement. However, no EU country has come forward as a potential host - delaying the plans.
""Nobody should have any doubt on the level of political ambition and determination by the member states involved, in particular France, Germany and the United Kingdom to swiftly operationalize the SPV,"" Europe's Climate and Energy Commissioner Miguel Arias Canete said at a joint news briefing.

Israel's diplomatic push in the Gulf, where it sees Arab states as its natural allies against regional powerhouse Iran, has become increasingly public after years of covert contacts.
Shared worries about Iran or needs in terms of security, agriculture and water have thawed hostility toward Israel among some Arab governments. After a surprise trip to Oman last month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday hosted a first visit by Chadian President Idriss Deby. 
""I myself received a personal invitation to Bahrain,"" Israeli Economy Minister Eli Cohen said in a radio interview.
Cohen told Army Radio the invitation was to a conference in the first quarter of 2019 ""in the realm of technology and high-tech, in which the State of Israel is certainly a leader"". He did not say whether he planned to attend.
Asked to elaborate, an Israeli official briefed on Cohen's affairs said the event to which he had been invited was the Startup Nations Ministerial conference on April 15, a forum for public policymakers to discuss how to promote entrepreneurs.
The official, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the matter, said the invitation originated with the Manama government and was relayed to Israel by Switzerland.
Officials in Manama did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Switzerland's ambassador to Israel, Jean-Daniel Ruch, said in an emailed statement that his embassy had no knowledge of any such invitation. 

Bahrain, where a Saudi-backed Sunni Muslim ruling family faces a Shia-led opposition, is one of several flashpoints in a regional tussle for influence between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Manama is a close ally of the Saudis and Emiratis, Gulf forces that Israel has described as potential partners against its arch-foe Iran.

Tokyo and Seoul have long been at loggerheads over the sovereignty of a group of islets called Takeshima in Japanese and Dokdo in Korean, which lie about halfway between the East Asian neighbors in the Sea of Japan, which Seoul refers to as the East Sea.
""This landing on Takeshima by a group of South Korean lawmakers was carried out despite Japan's advance protests and 
requests to call it off,"" Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a regular news conference.
""In light of our country's stance on sovereignty over Takeshima, this is by no means acceptable.""

The two countries share a bitter history that includes Japan's 1910-45 colonization of the Korean peninsula and the issue of ""comfort women"", a Japanese euphemism for South Korean women forced to work in Japanese military brothels in World War Two.
South Korea last week shut down a Japan-funded foundation created under a 2015 deal between the Asian neighbors to settle compensation for the women.
South Korea vowed to pursue a more ""victim-oriented"" approach, but the move prompted Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to warn South Korea that it was risking damaging ties by disbanding the fund.
South Korea's top court also ruled last month that Japan's Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp must compensate four South Koreans for their forced labor during the war, a verdict Japan denounced as ""unthinkable"".

ABU DHABI/DUBAI (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates on Monday pardoned and released a British academic jailed for life on spying charges, granting a request for clemency after showing a video of him purportedly confessing to membership of the UK's MI6 intelligence service.
The case has strained ties between the long-time allies, leading London to issue a forceful diplomatic response after last week's verdict was handed down, with a warning that it could hurt relations.
The UAE president issued the pardon as part of a mass clemency of more than 700 prisoners to mark the country's National Day, according to a statement on state news agency WAM. 
The pardon was effective immediately and Matthew Hedges, a 31-year-old doctoral student at Durham University held for more than six months, will be allowed to leave the country ""once formalities are completed,"" the statement said.
A UAE official later said Hedges lad been freed.
Britain's Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt welcomed the move, which he called ""fantastic news"".
""Although we didn't agree with charges we are grateful to UAE government for resolving issue speedily.""
Hunt said it was also a ""bittersweet moment"" because he was thinking about innocent people still detained in Iran, the arch-foe of Abu Dhabi. ""Justice won't be truly done until they too are safely home,"" he said.
Hedge's wife Daniela Tejada said his family was ""elated"" over the news.
AMICABLE SOLUTION
The UAE had signaled on Friday that it was working on an ""amicable solution"" to the case after Prime Minister Theresa May had described last week's sentence as deeply disappointing.
Hedges has been held since May 5, when he was arrested at Dubai International Airport after a two-week research visit.
Tejada has said he was kept in solitary confinement for more than five months and the evidence presented against him consisted of notes from his dissertation research.
Last week's hearing lasted less than five minutes, she said.
The UAE's ambassador to the UK has disputed the account, saying the case was ""extremely serious"" and there had not been a ""five minute show trial.""
Minutes before the pardon was announced, a UAE government spokesman showed journalists a video of Hedges purporting to confess to belonging to Britain's Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) and researching which military systems the UAE was buying.
In the video, which was sometimes inaudible and shown with subtitles that could not be independently verified, Hedges appeared to say he approached sources as a doctoral student.
The spokesman, Jaber al-Lamki, said Hedges was ""100 percent a secret service operative"" and aimed ""to steal the UAE's sensitive national secrets for his paymasters"", but did not take questions on the case.
He said Hedges aimed to gather information on government figures including ""members of the UAE's ruling families and their networks"" and economic data related to strategic firms.
Hedges had built an extensive network of contacts while working with Dubai's Institute for Near East & Gulf Military Analysis (INEGMA), then returned to the UAE ""on assignment as an undercover student on research trip"", Lamki said.
Hedges' family and colleagues have cast him as a talented researcher who fell foul of the UAE security and justice system. His dissertation research focused on security structures, tribalism and the consolidation of political power in Abu Dhabi, which are considered sensitive topics in the UAE, they said.
Like most Gulf states, the UAE brooks little public criticism of ruling family members, senior officials or policy and has prosecuted pro-democracy activists for what it calls insulting the country's leaders.

After the pardon, his family thanked British authorities and others who had offered their support in urging UAE authorities to release Hedges. ""The presidential pardon for Matt is the best news we could have received. Our six-plus months of nightmare are finally over,"" said Tejada, his wife.

(Reuters) - James Fields Jr., the man accused of killing a woman when he drove into a crowd of counterprotesters at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, was due to go on trial on Monday on a charge of first-degree murder.
Fields, 21, was among hundreds of white nationalists who attended the ""Unite the Right"" rally on Aug. 12, 2017, where prosecutors say he plowed his car into people protesting the event, killing Heather Heyer, 32, and injuring 19 others.
Fields has been charged in Virginia with 10 criminal counts including first-degree murder and malicious assault. According to court documents, the jury trial in Charlottesville Circuit Court is scheduled to last 18 days, through Dec. 13. 
If Fields is convicted of first-degree murder, he could face life in prison.
In June, the U.S. Department of Justice said it was also indicting Fields on 30 federal hate crimes charges, for which he could face the death penalty if convicted. Fields pleaded not guilty to the federal charges in July in his first court appearance since the rally.
A resident of Ohio, Fields routinely promoted racist ideologies on his social media accounts, including expressing support for Adolf Hitler and the Holocaust, according to federal prosecutors.
He had traveled to Charlottesville in August 2017 to join other white nationalists in protesting against the city's removal of a statue honoring a commander of the Confederate Army, the losing side of the U.S. Civil War, which fought for the preservation of slavery.
After the rally, U.S. President Donald Trump faced intense criticism when he seemed to equate the white nationalists with the counter-protesters, saying there were ""very fine people on both sides.""

563,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>",Senior House Democrats tap brakes on investigating Trump,"By Ginger Gibson and Mark Hosenball
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - After capturing the U.S. House of Representatives with a campaign that spoke of holding President Donald Trump accountable, some powerful House Democrats are now urging restraint and a focus on policy, at least at the outset.
An aggressive examination of the president is still needed, senior lawmakers and aides told Reuters. But Democratic leaders are trying to chart a measured path forward from early January when they will take over the House from Trump's Republicans.
That path will seek to avoid igniting political battles, for now, over matters such as Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, as well as possible collusion between Moscow and the Trump campaign and obstruction of justice.
Many Democrats want to probe these volatile topics, using subpoenas to get at documents and testimony they say Republicans have ignored for two years, lawmakers and aides said.
They also said they want to dig into Trump's property holdings, son-in-law Jared Kushner's businesses and daughter Ivanka Trump's use of private emails for official business.
But the investigative hard-chargers do not appear to be prevailing in shaping the Democrats' early 2019 agenda.
That is because other Democrats - including key committee leaders - want to focus on immigration, rising student loan debt, high-cost prescription drugs and the federal response to hurricane disasters, especially in Puerto Rico.
The Democrats' agenda will solidify in six to eight weeks. When it does, it will greatly shape the relationship for the next two years between Capitol Hill and Trump, who has not yet dealt with a chamber of Congress under opposition control.
Voters handed a House majority to Democrats in the Nov. 6 elections. With that comes more resources for investigations, but some members of key committees said they are concerned that rushing to wield that power could turn off voters.
Representative Jerrold Nadler, likely chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, is discouraging talk of an immediate push to impeach Trump. Other Democrats are doing the same.
At the House Intelligence Committee, members are debating whether to reopen the panel's 2016 Russian election-meddling probe, said sources who requested anonymity.
Representative Adam Schiff, on track to become the panel's chairman, is leading a faction that wants to hold off on reopening the Russian inquiry, said sources.
At the same time, Schiff is talking publicly about investigating Trump's ties to Russia, which has denied interfering in the 2016 election to favor Trump.
Democrat Joaquin Castro, an Intelligence Committee member, favors committees starting the 2019-2020 Congress with hearings on issues such as the separation of immigrant children from their parents. But he told Reuters that Republicans have ""turned a blind eye to key leads in the investigation into Russia’s interference in our 2016 election ...
""In the next Congress, we will be sure to revisit all those leads, while at the same time actively examining whether Russians were money laundering through the Trump Organization, gaining any leverage over the president.""
Republicans have already begun criticizing Democrats, even before their first investigation is launched, embracing the term ""presidential harassment"" that Trump likes to use.
At the same time, Republicans reopened 2016's wounds on Friday when the House Judiciary Committee said Republican Bob Goodlatte, with only weeks to go as committee chairman, issued subpoenas for former FBI Director James Comey and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch to give depositions in a probe of their handling of an inquiry into Hillary Clinton’s emails.
A committee statement said Comey would be deposed on Dec. 3 and Lynch on Dec. 4 about the long-festering email issue involving Clinton, the Democrat defeated by Trump in 2016.
Before the current lame-duck Congress ends in mid-December, House Democrats will choose a party leader for 2019-2020, with their current leader Nancy Pelosi the front-runner.
The leader and committee chairs have a ""vision"" for the investigative agenda, but details are still being discussed, a senior aide said.
The wide-ranging House Oversight Committee is likely to be chaired by Representative Elijah Cummings. He has called an examination of high prescription drug costs a top priority.
Still, Cummings told Reuters the panel has asked for information on the reported use by Ivanka Trump, who serves as a senior aide to her father, of personal email to contact other administration officials, a possible records preservation law violation.
The White House has ignored the request, Cummings said. ""We need those documents to ensure that Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, and other officials are complying with federal records laws,"" he said.
Democratic committee member Carolyn Maloney said she was pushing Cummings to probe the administration's decision to add a question about citizenship to the U.S. Census. 

    Matt Cartwright, another Oversight Democrat, said, ""I'm against weaponizing the committee, however, I don't want to defang the committee by the same token ... Our committee should be more than a political loudspeaker.""

KAMPALA (Reuters) - The death toll from a boat accident on Lake Victoria over the weekend rose to 33 on Monday, Ugandan police said, as survivors described moments of heavy drinking and raucous fun before the vessel, slammed by powerful waves, tilted and sank. 
The Saturday evening tragedy occurred hundreds of meters off shore as the boat, carrying an estimated 100 revellers, was en route from one beach to another in Mukono district near the capital Kampala. 
Police spokesman, Patrick Onyango said the number of bodies retrieved from the water stood at 33 on Monday while 27 people have been rescued alive. The death toll was expected to rise, he said.
This is the second deadly accident to happen on Lake Victoria in as many months. In September, more than 200 people died when an overloaded ferry sank on the Tanzanian side of the lake. 
Divers from the police and military pressed on with efforts to retrieve bodies while equipment was deployed to try to tug the boat wreck to shore, Onyango said. 
Boat cruises on Lake Victoria, which is shared by Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania, are common, with mostly young revellers spending hours out on the waters partying. 
One survivor, Shamirah Nsereko, told local NTV Uganda on Sunday night the captain had repeatedly warned the passengers that the boat was tilting to one side and taking in water.
""But then you're talking to people who are so drunk,"" she said, adding the revellers couldn't hear the captain's commands. 
""Suddenly we saw one of the (music) speakers fall out, that was when things had gotten really bad."" 
On Sunday, President Yoweri Museveni blamed the accident on overloading, saying the boat was carrying more than its capacity of 50.
The owner of the boat and his wife, had perished in the accident, he said. 
Another survivor Edward Kateregga, also told NTV Uganda the boat's engine experienced faults repeatedly before the disaster occurred. In the scramble that ensued as the boat sank, a lot of people jumped onto a canoe that arrived within minutes to rescue the victims. 
""I jumped off it and back into the water after realizing it wasn't going to manage. A minute barely passed before it also capsized,"" Kateregga said.

569,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2018 04:55AM ET</span>",Indonesian app to report 'misguided' religion 'risks dividing neighbors',"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's national human rights agency said on Monday it was concerned about the launch of a mobile application by the Jakarta Prosecutor's Office, which allows members of the public to report religious beliefs they consider ""misguided"".
Indonesia has no state religion but has traditionally required citizens to register as Muslim, Catholic, Protestant, Hindu, Buddhist or Confucian, though last year the Constitutional Court affirmed the rights of faiths outside official religions after a challenge by some indigenous faiths.
Nonetheless, there remain concerns about rising intolerance in the world's biggest Muslim-majority country as well as the use of strict blasphemy laws against minorities and the targeting of Islamic sects such as the Ahmadiyyah. 
The app, called ""Smart Pakem"", features a list of groups including Ahmadiyyah as well as Gafatar, which the country’s highest Islamic council considers a deviant sect. 
It was not clear what the list represented, but some of the groups such as Gafatar have been outlawed and the app has a link that allows members of the public to report organizations deemed harmful.
The app could have a ""dangerous consequence by causing social disintegration"", said Amiruddin Al-Rahab, a commissioner at the National Commission on Human Rights.
""When neighbors are reporting each other, that would be problematic,"" Al-Rahab told Reuters.
Despite facing a backlash from human rights groups, the free app was available for download on Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc’s Google Play store on Monday afternoon.
Al-Rahab said since the app's features were not running in full it was unclear whether the prosecutor's office would include detailed guidance on the kind of organization categorized as ""harmful"" or beliefs deemed as ""misguided"".
""Don't leave the people in confusion, if people are confused they will take matters into their own hands,"" he said, adding that the app could also contravene the Constitutional Court's ruling last year on the rights of devotees of faiths outside the state-recognized religions.
The Jakarta Prosecutor's Office could not immediately be reached for comment.
Yulianto, an official at the Jakarta Prosecutor's Office, was quoted as saying by the news site Kompas.com that the app aimed to educate people and to increase the transparency of the reporting process.
Indonesia's attorney general's office has the authority under the law to monitor religions in case beliefs are deemed a threat to the community and can establish teams to examine such claims.

The Sunday night earthquake was felt in at least seven provinces of Iran, but most strongly in Kermanshah, where last year more than 600 people were killed and thousands injured in the country's deadliest earthquake in more than a decade. 
""Rouhani has ordered officials to do whatever is necessary to provide help for the victims of the earthquake,"" TV reported.
The head of Iran's Red Crescent Society, Mahmoud Mohammadi Nasab, told TV that there were no fatalities.
TV aired footage of damaged houses in the town of Sarpol-e Zahab in Kermanshah where some people remain homeless following last year’s 7.3 magnitude quake. 
""We have had 729 injured, 700 of them have been treated and released ... some 18 people have been hospitalized,"" Houshang Bazvand, governor of the western province of Kermanshah, told state TV.
Iran's state news agency IRNA said another two earthquakes measuring 5.2 and 4.6 on the Richter scale had jolted Sarpol-e Zahab on Monday morning following Sunday's earthquake and 161 aftershocks. 
Fears of aftershocks forced many people to spend the night out on the streets in cold weather. The quake triggered landslides in some areas, but Iranian authorities said rescue teams had access to all towns and villages. 
Iran sits astride major fault lines and is prone to frequent tremors. In 2003, a 6.6 magnitude quake in Kerman province killed 31,000 people and flattened the historic city of Bam.
Sunday's tremor was also felt in Kuwait and the Iraqi capital Baghdad as well as in Erbil in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region and other Iraqi provinces, but no damage was reported.

Kubra Rezaie, a spokeswoman at the Independent Election Commission (IEC), said an option was being considered in which the presidential election, along with already delayed parliamentary elections in the central province of Ghazni and district council elections could be delayed by three months.
""But we cannot say they will be postponed because this is something at an initial stage,"" she said.
Last month's parliamentary elections, which saw huge delays at polling stations across Afghanistan, came in for heavy criticism over problems ranging from incomplete voter lists to malfunctioning biometric voter verification equipment.
However, any delay to the presidential ballot could provoke strong opposition from political groups, many of which suspect President Ashraf Ghani of trying to engineer his own re-election.
The issue is complicated by diplomatic efforts to start peace talks with the Taliban, who have met U.S. special peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad but who have refused to deal with the Afghan government, which they consider illegitimate.
The IEC has announced preliminary result for parliamentary elections in 10 of the 33 Afghan provinces where voting took place. The election was not held in Ghazni due to disputes over representation between different ethnic groups.

Results in the rest of the provinces have yet to be announced as recounting votes continues in some provinces, caused by the large number of complaints about fairness.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Al Shabaab gunmen and a suicide car bomber struck a religious center in central Somalia on Monday, killing a cleric and at least 14 of his followers, a police officer said
The Islamist militant group had accused the cleric of insulting Prophet Mohamed, which he denied.
The group was forced from Mogadishu in 2011 and most towns and cities but it retains a strong presence outside the capital and launches frequent bombings and other attacks in a campaign to topple the federal government.
""The (security) operation is now over. Al Shabaab killed 15 people including the cleric, his wife, his followers and his guards,"" Captain Nur Mohamed, a police officer, told Reuters from Galkayo by phone.
""Three militants who stormed the center were also shot dead.""
The group took responsibility for the attack and put the number of dead at 26. It said some soldiers who responded to the first attack also died as they tried to remove a second car bomb.
""We killed 26 people including the owner of the center, his followers, his bodyguards and soldiers,"" Abdiasis Abu Musab, al Shabaab’s military operation spokesman, said.
""The owner of the center was the man who abused the prophet. The soldiers that died tried to drive a second car bomb that was left by the armed Mujahideen.""
Residents of Galkayo and a regional official said Abdiweli may have also been targeted because his center hosts mostly youths who play music and dance.
Al Shabaab said last year the cleric had insulted the Prophet, an accusation denied at the time by Abdiweli. 
Abdirashid Hashi, the governor of Mudug region, told Reuters that al Shabaab had threatened Abdiweli on numerous occasions.
An elder in Galkayo said Abdiweli had provided free boarding to former pirates, street boys and jobless men and they became his followers.
""He used to tell teenagers: ""If you were a pirate, or a bandit, stop it and come and dance, eat food and sleep here. God will forgive your sins. Some other ignorant teenagers thought he was as saint ... and so joined him,"" local elder Ismail Abdirahman told Reuters.
""We understood there was something wrong with him but we could not take him to court because the man was well armed.""
Al Shabaab is fighting to establish its own rule based on its harsh interpretation of Islamic law. The group controls small sections on Mudug region, but it does not include Galkayo.

MOSCOW/KIEV (Reuters) - Russia seized three Ukrainian naval ships off the coast of Russia-annexed Crimea on Sunday after opening fire on them and wounding several sailors, a move that risks igniting a dangerous new crisis between the two countries.
Russia's FSB security service said early on Monday its border patrol boats had seized the Ukrainian naval vessels in the Black Sea and used weapons to force them to stop, Russian news agencies reported.
The FSB said it had been forced to act because the ships - two small Ukrainian armored artillery vessels and a tug boat - had illegally entered its territorial waters, attempted illegal actions, and ignored warnings to stop while maneuvering dangerously.
""Weapons were used with the aim of forcibly stopping the Ukrainian warships,"" the FSB said in a statement circulated to Russian state media.
""As a result, all three Ukrainian naval vessels were seized in the Russian Federation's territorial waters in the Black Sea."" 
The FSB said three Ukrainian sailors were wounded in the incident and were getting medical care. Their lives were not in danger, it said.
With relations still raw after Russia's annexation of Crimea and its backing for a pro-Moscow insurgency in eastern Ukraine, the incident risks pushing the two countries toward a wider conflict.
Ukraine denied its ships had done anything wrong, accused Russia of military aggression, and asked for the international community to mobilize to punish Russia.
The U.N. Security Council will meet on the latest developments at the request of Russia and Ukraine, diplomats said.
POROSHENKO PROPOSES MARTIAL LAW
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko met his top military and security chiefs. Poroshenko said he would propose that parliament impose martial law.
Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and then built a giant road bridge linking it to southern Russia that straddles the Kerch Strait - a narrow stretch of water that links the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov, which is home to two of Ukraine's most important ports.
Russia's control of Crimea, where its Black Sea Fleet is based, and of the bridge mean it is able to control shipping flows.
The crisis began on Sunday after Russia stopped the three Ukrainian ships from entering the Sea of Azov by placing a cargo ship beneath the bridge.
A Reuters witness said Russia backed its blockade with at least two Sukhoi Su-25 warplanes that screeched overhead. Russian state TV said Russian combat helicopters had been deployed in the area. 
The Ukrainian navy said on social media six Ukrainian sailors were wounded in the subsequent seizure of its ships, which appear to have been rammed and boarded, and that the Russian attack on them had occurred after they had retreated and headed back toward Odessa, the Black Sea port from where they had begun their journey.
""After leaving the 12-mile zone, the Russian Federation's FSB (security service) opened fire at the flotilla belonging to ... the armed forces of Ukraine,"" it said in a statement.
The European Union said in a statement it expected Russia to restore freedom of passage via the Kerch Strait and urged both sides to act with utmost restraint to de-escalate the situation. A NATO spokeswoman issued a similar appeal to both sides.
RISK OF WIDER CONFLICT
A bilateral treaty gives both Russia and Ukraine the right to use the Sea of Azov, which lies between them and is linked by the narrow Kerch Strait to the Black Sea. Tension has risen since Russia annexed Crimea, with both countries complaining about shipping delays and harassment. 
Russia's border guard service accused Ukraine earlier on Sunday of not informing it in advance of the three ships' journey, something Kiev denied.
Russia said the Ukrainian ships had been maneuvering dangerously and ignoring its instructions with the aim of stirring up tensions.
Russian politicians denounced Kiev, saying the incident looked like a calculated bid by Poroshenko to increase his popularity ahead of an election next year.
In another sign of rising tensions, Russia's state-controlled RIA news agency reported on Sunday night that Ukrainian forces had started heavy shelling of residential areas in eastern Ukraine, which is controlled by pro-Moscow separatists.

Reuters could not independently confirm that and the Interfax news agency cited separatists as denying there had been any unusual escalation.

Senior state politicians laid wreathes and paid tribute to the victims at a Martyrs' Memorial in downtown Mumbai, while other events were held at some of the sites of the three-day attack, which began on Nov. 26, 2008.
Six Americans were among the 166 people killed by 10 gunmen who infiltrated the financial hub by boat and spent three days spraying bullets and throwing grenades around various city landmarks. [https://reut.rs/2DIQvAM] 
""A grateful nation bows to our brave police and security forces who valiantly fought the terrorists during the Mumbai attacks,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Twitter.
India has blamed militants linked to the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) group for the attacks and said the gunmen, all but one of whom were killed in the assault, were Pakistani.
Pakistan condemned the attack, denied involvement of any of its agencies and offered to cooperate with India in the investigation.
Nevertheless, tension soared between the nuclear-armed rivals after the attacks.
India and the United States accused Hafiz Saeed, who founded the LeT, of being the attack mastermind. He denied involvement but Pakistani authorities placed him under house arrest for different periods. He was most recently released in November 2017.
U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo called on Pakistan to uphold their U.N. Security Council obligations to implement sanctions against those responsible for this attack, including LeT and its affiliates.
""It is an affront to the families of the victims that, after ten years, those who planned the Mumbai attack have still not been convicted for their involvement,"" Pompeo said in a statement.
A spokesman for the Pakistan government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The U.S. State Department also announced a reward of up to $5 million for any information leading to arrests or convictions of those involved in the execution of the 2008 Mumbai attack. 
Mumbai's Chabad House, a Jewish center the gunmen attacked, unveiled a memorial to the victims on Sunday, renaming the center the ""Nariman Light House"".

LONDON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With offers from four American universities, Mani Rezaei Rad gave up his well-paid job with a Siemens affiliate company in Tehran last year and proposed to his girlfriend so they could be together while he studied in the United States.
Getting a U.S. student visa normally takes a few months, but 16 months later, he was still waiting. The uncertainty and lack of work took its toll on the relationship and the couple split.
""I was sliding into depression. I felt hollow and useless,"" said Rezaei Rad, who had won places to study for a post-graduate degree in electrical engineering. Eventually he gave up his American dream and got a place at a European university instead.
Thousands of Iranians study in the United States each year, one of the few gates that has been kept open since the two countries cut diplomatic ties in 1980 after Iran's Islamic Revolution the year before.
Iranian students are exempt from a travel ban initially introduced by President Donald Trump in 2017, which largely bars citizens of Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, as well as a small number of Venezuelans.
Data from the Institute of International Education (IIE), which tracks foreign students in the United States, shows that the number of Iranians studying in the country is the highest in decades, at 12,800. But there are signs it is on the wane.
State Department data showed that 355 fewer F1 student visas were granted to Iranians from March-October than the same period last year, a 23 percent drop; it compares with a five percent drop for foreign students overall, a more normal fluctuation.
A wider total incorporating visas for Iranian students and their dependents has fallen for the past three school years. Meanwhile, several European universities said the number of Iranians studying there had gone up.
Reuters has found more than two dozen cases where Iranian U.S. student visa applications were subject to delays. Asked about such delays, a State Department official said security was paramount.
IRANIANS, EVERY ONE
Trump withdrew this year from an international deal to curb Iran's nuclear program and re-imposed sanctions, signaling the end of a wary detente between Washington and Tehran and a new phase of confrontation.
Visa (NYSE:V) ban exemptions, such as the one covering Iranian students, were cited by the Trump administration in the Supreme Court this year in countering allegations the policy constituted a ""Muslim ban"" akin to what Trump had called for during the 2016 presidential campaign.
Lawyers for the government argued in one brief to the Supreme Court that Trump’s policy ""does not impose blanket bans but allows entry of some classes of nationals from the covered countries."" The Supreme Court, in a 5 to 4 split, allowed the ban to go forward in June.
The State Department does not publish visa application numbers, making it hard to assess how much of the drop in the number of study visas granted to Iranians is due to rejections or delays and how much is because fewer of them are applying.
American universities enjoy an elite reputation in Iran and welcome its students, many of whom take courses in engineering and go on to fill skills shortages in the U.S. and elsewhere.
Back in Iran, they counterbalance powerful conservative religious forces and provide a bridge to the West for future rapprochement. In the lead-up to the 2015 international nuclear deal, six out of 25 members of President Hassan Rouhani's 2014 cabinet held U.S. degrees.
Twelve Iranians with places at U.S. universities told Reuters their visa applications were “under administrative processing” for extended periods, a term that generally refers to extensive background checks.
Separately, around 15 Iranians hoping to study at Oklahoma State University this fall had visa delays, a university official said.
Regina Henry, the immigration coordinator at OSU’s international students office, said she wrote letters giving them permission to arrive two weeks late. But that window was not enough for any of the 15. Typically, Henry has to write a maximum of five such letters each semester.
""This is the first time I’ve ever had to write so many and they were all Iranians, every one of them,"" she said.
Some department heads at the university were becoming more hesitant to grant coveted graduate assistant positions to Iranian applicants, she said, even if they were their first choice, given the visa trouble they face.
A State Department official at the Bureau of Consular Affairs, when asked about the delays, said on condition of anonymity that national security was the top priority when adjudicating visa applications.
""We are constantly working to find mechanisms to improve our screening processes and to support legitimate travel and immigration to the United States while protecting U.S. citizens,” the official said. 
TIPPING POINT?
Historical data, which tracks the wider F category of visas granted to students and their dependents, shows that issuance of such visas to Iranians began falling in the year to end-Sept 2015 after rising several years in a row. After a one percent drop that year, it fell by 17 percent and 16 percent respectively the two following years.
Washington has placed restrictions on Iranian students for years: a 2012 law signed by former U.S. President Barack Obama barred granting visas to Iranians to study fields that would prepare them for working in Iran’s energy sector, nuclear science, or nuclear engineering.
Yet the school year after that saw a 17 percent jump in the number of Iranian students in the United States, IIE data show.
European signatories of the nuclear deal are still committed to the accord and are trying to create a financial mechanism to protect trade with Tehran against U.S. penalties.
Security concerns are less of a problem for Iranians in Europe. After he gave up on a U.S. visa, Rezaei Rad got one from Spain in just four weeks to study at a university in Barcelona.
Dutch universities admitted 82 more Iranian students in 2017, data from educational non-profit group Nuffic showed, while Germany's Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich said it had 20 more Iranians enrolled this year.
Uppsala University in Sweden said 135 more Iranians applied in 2018 compared with 2016, and Humboldt University of Berlin and Eberhard Karls University of Tübinge in Germany also said numbers had risen.
Some people are still holding out for a U.S. place. Tehran resident Abbas was admitted to an American university and applied for a U.S. visa last year, but was still waiting when this year's enrolment came and went.
""I have lost two years of study so far,"" the 31-year-old said by telephone, withholding his full name for fear his comments might affect his application.

582,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2018 12:52AM ET</span>",Australia PM holds emergency meeting as electoral oblivion looms,"By Colin Packham
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison held an emergency meeting with members of his embattled Liberal party on Monday as his minority government stared down the barrel at a heavy election defeat within the next six months.
Morrison met lawmakers from Victoria, Australia's second-most populous state, where voters overwhelmingly turned against the Liberals in a state election on Saturday, stoking panic within the Liberal-National coalition.
Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, who is from Victoria, said the meeting was productive but declined to specify what was said.
""We had a good, honest discussion about lessons to be learned from the state campaign,"" Frydenberg told reporters in Canberra.
The meeting came just hours after Australia's pre-eminent opinion poll showed the government on course for a heavy defeat by the Labor opposition at the next national election, which is due by May.
A Newspoll for The Australian newspaper showed Morrison's government was on course to lose 21 seats in the 150-seat lower house of parliament. The Newspoll showed support of just 35 percent for the government, just one percentage point above its record low.
With such a heavy loss on the horizon, liberal and more conservative elements of Morrison's party clashed publicly over the need to change policy.
Tim Wilson, a backbench lawmaker from Victoria, said the state result showed voters wanted the government to move away from fossil fuels such as coal.
Former prime minister Tony Abbott dismissed the suggestion, arguing for stronger conservative policies.
The split came as Morrison faced a hostile parliament for the first time since his government was confirmed in minority.
Morrison lost his one-seat parliamentary majority earlier in November when an independent candidate won a by-election for the affluent Sydney seat held by former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, who quit politics after he was ousted in a party-room coup in August.
Morrison struck a deal with an independent lawmaker to continue ruling in minority but the government faces an anxious final two-week parliamentary session for the year.
The numerical disadvantage forced Morrison's government into an immediate and embarrassing climb-down over the setting up of an anti-corruption body.
It had rejected Labor's calls for such an organization, but sided with the opposition when it became obvious it would lose a vote on the floor. 
Labor could also seek a parliamentary vote to demand Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton be referred to Australia's High Court for a ruling on whether he is eligible to remain as a sitting member.
Dutton, who has financial interests in daycare centers that receive government funding, risks falling foul of Australia's constitution, which bans lawmakers from benefiting from state funds.

The government's most senior legal adviser said earlier this year Dutton was eligible, although Labor is pressing independents to support a court referral.

Oravec said Kansas and Chicago were likely to see ""high impact"" blizzard conditions later on Sunday. 
More than 1,240 fights headed to or from the United States were canceled by Sunday evening, according to FlightAware.com.

Most of the cancellations were of flights departing or arriving at Chicago O'Hare International Airport and Chicago Midway Airport, which combined saw a total of about 900 flights canceled. At Kansas City International Airport, nearly 200 flights were canceled.

TIJUANA, Mexico (Reuters) - U.S. authorities shut the country's busiest border crossing and fired tear gas into Mexico on Sunday to repel Central American migrants approaching the border after U.S. President Donald Trump vowed the asylum-seekers would not easily enter the country. 
Traffic in both directions was suspended for several hours at the San Ysidro port of entry between San Diego and Tijuana, U.S. officials said, disrupting trade at the most heavily trafficked land border in the Western Hemisphere. Pedestrian crossings and vehicle traffic later resumed, officials said.
Tensions on the border had been rising in recent days, with thousands of Central American migrants who arrived in a caravan camped out in a sports stadium in Tijuana. On Sunday, Mexican police broke up the latest in a series of daily protests, triggering a rush toward the U.S. border.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers stopped the migrants with a volley of canisters emitting large clouds of gas as U.S. and Mexican government helicopters clattered overhead.
The Mexican government said it had retaken control of the border crossing after nearly 500 migrants tried to cross the U.S. border ""in a violent manner,"" and vowed to immediately deport Central Americans who attempt to enter the United States illegally. 
Trump has raised alarm for weeks about the caravan of Central American migrants as it approached the United States, with its members planning to apply for asylum on reaching the country.
The mostly Honduran migrants are fleeing poverty and violence and have said they would wait in Tijuana until they could request asylum in the United States, despite growing U.S. measures to tighten the border.
Hundreds of caravan members including women and children protested peacefully on Sunday with chants of ""We aren't criminals! We are hard workers."" As they neared the U.S. border, they were stopped by Mexican authorities, who told them to wait for permission.  
As the morning wore on, and it became clear they would not get permission, people started to express frustration.
MILITARY POLICE DEPLOYED
Groups of migrants, some of them bearing the Honduran flag, broke off and headed toward the border fence, where U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers gathered on the other side, backed by U.S. military police, San Diego police and the California Highway Patrol.
The Americans responded with tear gas after the migrants hit them with projectiles, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said on Twitter.
""Border Patrol agents deployed tear gas to dispel the group because of the risk to agents' safety,"" the statement said.
Protesters were caught between the Mexican and U.S. authorities. A young woman fell to the ground unconscious, and two babies cried, tears streaming from the gas, a Reuters witness said.
""They want us to wait in Mexico but I for one am desperate. My little girl is sick and I don't even have money for milk,"" said Joseph Garcia, 32, of Honduras. ""I can't stand it anymore.""
Trump has deployed military forces to the border to support the Border Patrol and threatened on Saturday to close the entire southern border. 
Military police were sent to the border crossing and military engineers moved barricades as part of the enforcement, the U.S. Northern Command said in a statement on Sunday.
""Department of Defense military personnel will not be conducting law enforcement functions, but are authorized to provide force protection for Customs and Border Protection personnel,"" the statement said.
An average of 70,000 vehicles and 20,000 pedestrians cross from Mexico to the United States at San Ysidro each day, according to the U.S. General Services Administration.
Duncan Wood, director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center research group in Washington, called the closure a ""drastic response"" and said it would cost ""many millions of dollars.""
U.S. and Mexican negotiators met on Sunday to discuss a plan to keep the Central Americans in Mexico while their asylum claims are heard. Normally, asylum-seekers announce their intention on arriving at U.S. ports of entry or after crossing the border illegally.

Trump has been pushing for a U.S.-Mexico border wall and warned on Thursday there could be a government shutdown next month if the U.S. Congress failed to provide funding. Sunday's events took place at one of the stretches where there is a physical border barrier.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran said on Sunday that no fatalities had been reported but that more than 400 people were injured after an earthquake of magnitude 6.3 struck near its western border with Iraq, Iranian state TV reported.
The tremor was also felt in the Iraqi capital Baghdad and in Kuwait. 
""We have had 411 injured, 80 percent of whom have been treated and released ... No fatalities have been reported,"" Houshang Bazvand, governor of the western province of Kermanshah, told state TV.
Fears of aftershocks sent people in several cities in Kermanshah province out onto the streets and parks in cold weather, Iranian media reported. Rescue teams were immediately deployed to the quake-hit area.
""No reports of any fatalities yet and most of the injured were hurt while fleeing, not due to quake damage,"" Pirhossein Koulivand, head of Iran's emergency services, told state TV.
State TV reported minor damage at some buildings in the area. The quake triggered landslides but officials said all the roads in the area remained open to traffic and that electricity had been restored in most of areas hit by the tremor.
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said the earthquake occurred at a depth of 65 km (40 miles) and struck 114 km northwest of the city of Ilam, close to Iran's border with Iraq. 
Iranian media said tremors were felt in at least seven provinces of Iran, most strongly in Kermanshah province, where last year over 600 people were killed and thousands injured in Iran's deadliest earthquake in more than a decade. 
Local officials said reconstruction undertaken after that strong quake should mean there would not be casualties in the area, where some people still remain homeless following last year's tremor.
Kermanshah governor Bazvand said more than 200 people were injured in the town of Sarpol-e Zahab, about 15 km (10 miles) from the border, near the quake's epicenter. 
The Iraqi Geological Survey said the quake had been felt in Baghdad, where the interior ministry said no damage or casualties were reported, Erbil in the Kurdistan region, and other Iraqi provinces.
The quake was felt in some areas of Kuwait but no damage was reported, state news agency Kuna said. 
""Fortunately, the quake was not near bigger cities. But it might have caused damage in villages and I hope not that many villages are located where it hit,"" Ali Moradi, head of Iran's seismology center, told state TV.
Iran sits astride major fault lines and is prone to frequent tremors. Last November, a magnitude 7.3 earthquake hit the Kermanshah province. In 2003, a quake of a magnitude of 6.6 in Kerman province killed 31,000 people and flattened the historic city of Bam.

With the help of U.S. jets and special forces, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance is battling the remnants of Islamic State in an enclave near the Iraqi border. 
The SDF restored positions it had lost to attacks in recent days, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Battles raged on the eastern bank of the Euphrates river on Sunday. 
""The SDF did regain back a lot of territory lost the other day,"" Colonel Sean Ryan, spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition, told Reuters. ""Both sides took casualties."" 
Iraqi security forces are securing the border so no fighters can escape, he added. 
The SDF, which the Kurdish YPG militia leads, has seized vast territory from the jihadists across northern and eastern Syria, where some 2,000 U.S. troops are stationed.
SDF officials were not immediately available for comment.
Islamic State's self-proclaimed caliphate has crumbled after different offensives in Iraq and Syria, but its fighters still operate in the desert border region and mount attacks. 
Syrian state news agency SANA said coalition warplanes killed 14 people ""in a new massacre"" in al-Shaafa village. Air strikes had killed 20 other people, including nine children, in the nearby town of Hajin, it said a day earlier. 
The U.S.-led coalition says it seeks to avoid civilian casualties and investigates any allegations. Colonel Ryan said on Saturday that strikes were limited and had not affected civilians. 
The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the death toll at 31 civilians in the past two days, as well as 50 Islamic State and 79 SDF combatants. 
Islamic State released a graphic video overnight showing its militants beheading a hostage and threatening the families of SDF fighters. 
Its media outlet Amaq on Saturday said the jihadists staged attacks on two fronts, killing dozens of Kurdish milita fighters and taking 30 others hostage. 
Separately, in the northwest, more than 100 people were wounded in a suspected toxic gas attack in Aleppo city, which Damascus and Moscow blamed on rebel factions.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - More than 100 people were wounded in Syria's Aleppo late on Saturday in a suspected toxic gas attack which the government and its ally, Russia, blamed on insurgents.
A health official in Aleppo said victims suffered breathing difficulties, eye inflammation and other symptoms suggesting the use of chlorine gas. Rebel officials denied the allegations and said their forces did not possess chemical weapons.
Russia's defense ministry said on Sunday its warplanes bombed militants in the insurgent stronghold of Idlib who it accused of firing poison gas at Aleppo. 
Major-General Igor Konashenkov said Moscow sent advance warning to Ankara, which backs some rebel factions and helped broker a ceasefire in Idlib. 
A monitoring group said air strikes hit rebel territory in northwest Syria on Sunday for the first time since Russia and Turkey agreed a buffer zone there in September. 
In Aleppo city, which the government controls, the shells had spread a strong stench and caused breathing problems, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said.
State news agency SANA said on Sunday 107 people were injured, including children, after militants hit three districts with projectiles containing gases that caused choking. 
It marks the highest such casualty toll in Aleppo since government forces and their allies clawed back the city from rebels nearly two years ago. 
""We can not know the kinds of gases but we suspected chlorine and treated patients on this basis because of the symptoms,"" Zaher Batal, the head of the Aleppo Doctors Syndicate, told Reuters.
Hospitals had discharged many people overnight. Batal said this was the first gas attack against civilians in the city since the conflict erupted more than seven years ago. 
STRETCHERS AND OXYGEN MASKS
Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar and his Russian counterpart agreed on Sunday that ""recent provocations"" were aimed at harming the agreement on Idlib, the ministry said.
""There was an exchange of views to the effect that ... they could continue and that one needed to be ready for them,"" the ministry said in a statement. 
Nobody has claimed the Aleppo attack so far. 
""The explosive (shells) contain toxic gases that led to choking among civilians,"" the city's police chief Issam al-Shilli told state media. 
Pictures and footage on SANA showed medical workers carrying patients on stretchers and helping them with oxygen masks.
Syria's foreign ministry urged the U.N. Security Council to condemn and punish the attack. 
Abdel-Salam Abdel-Razak, an official from the Nour el-Din al-Zinki insurgent faction, said rebels did not own chemical weapons or have the capacity to produce them. 
Abu Omar, a Failaq al-Sham spokesman, accused Damascus of trying to create ""a malicious charade"" as a pretext to attack rebel towns. 
The UK-based Observatory said government shelling earlier on Saturday had killed two women and seven children in a village in Idlib. 
The Russian-Turkish deal in September for a demilitarized zone staved off an army offensive against the Idlib region, including nearby parts of Aleppo and Hama provinces. 
The dominant force among an array of factions holding sway in Idlib is Tahrir al-Sham, an Islamist alliance led by fighters formerly linked to al-Qaeda.
A past U.N.-OPCW inquiry found the Syrian government used the nerve agent sarin in 2017 and also used chlorine several times. It also blamed Islamic State for using mustard gas.
Damascus has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons in the war.

No rebel group has been confirmed to have used chemical weapons in the war by the by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).

Libya, with which Egypt and Sudan have a joint border, has been riven by internal strife since Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in 2011 and a power vacuum has grown that has allowed rival militias and armed Islamist groups to grow.
""It was agreed to establish joint military patrols between the two countries' borders, establish mechanisms to control the border and establish future joint forces on the border to combat terrorism, cross-border crimes, control the border and combat all manifestations of evasion,"" Sudanese Chief of Staff Kamal Abdul Maarouf told reporters.
He said the two militaries would form a strategic partnership in all fields, especially intelligence and operational cooperation and training. 
Joint investments were also agreed, Abdul Maarouf said, as well as allowing Egypt to establish agricultural and animal production projects in Sudan.
Relations between Egypt and Sudan have improved markedly over the past year despite persisting tensions over a Nile dam which Ethiopia is building. Egypt sees the project as a threat to its water supply but Sudan backs it because of its need for electricity.
The two countries have also long been in a standoff over the disputed ""Halayeb Triangle,"" which they both claim as their territory but Egypt controls. Sudan renewed a complaint at the U.N. in January demanding Egypt hand over control of the border area.

The number of people still missing from the Camp Fire north of San Francisco dropped to 249 on Sunday, the Butte County Sheriff's Office said. The number was revised down from 475 as people who were believed missing were found in shelters, staying in hotels or with friends, officials said, adding that many did not know they were on the list. 
The Camp Fire that started on Nov. 8 destroyed nearly 14,000 homes and burned nearly 154,000 acres (62,000 hectares) - an area five times the size of San Francisco. 
Searchers will have a few more days of dry weather, but starting late Tuesday, another 2-5 inches (5 to 13 cm) of rain is expected to drop on the Sierra Nevada foothills through next Sunday, hampering the searchers work and renewing fears of flash floods and mudslides, forecasters said.
""The fear is that the rain will drop in intense bursts,"" Brian Hurley, a meteorologist with the federal Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland, said early Sunday.
""All the vegetation has burned away, and that's a dangerous recipe for mudslides,"" Hurley said.
Last week, 2-3 inches (5-8 cm) of rain fell there and turned ash from the thousands of destroyed homes into slurry, complicating the work of finding bodies reduced to bone fragments.
Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea has warned that remains of some victims may never be found. 
The town of Paradise was a popular destination for retirees, with people aged 65 or older accounting for a quarter of its 27,000 residents. Most of the victims of the fire identified so far were of retirement age.
Investigators have yet to determine the cause of the fire. 

Thousands of people forced to flee Paradise spent Thanksgiving in warehouses in the nearby city of Chico, or with friends or relatives in nearby towns.

Protesters clad in fluorescent jackets, dubbed ""yellow vests"", have blocked highways across France since Nov. 17, setting up burning barricades and deploying convoys of slow-moving trucks, often denying access to shopping centers and some factories.
French retailers have warned that prolonged protests could hit the Christmas shopping season and threaten jobs, while President Emmanuel Macron has shown no sign of backing down on taxes introduced last year on diesel and petrol to encourage people to switch to cleaner forms of transport..

The Democracy in Europe Movement 2025 (DiEM25), which he launched in 2016 to ""democratize"" the continent, picked him on Sunday as a candidate for the elections to the European Parliament in May 2019.
""I accept (the nomination) because it epitomizes the new trans-national politics we need in Europe,"" he told a news conference in Berlin where his colleagues unfurled a banner with the slogan ""European Spring"". 
""I call on all of you to join us in this pan-European quest for democracy in Europe, democracy in Germany as a condition for prosperity and authentic democracy,"" he said. 
The motorbike-riding academic-economist, who rose to celebrity status in the euro crisis, once described the austerity measures forced on Greece by creditors as ""fiscal waterboarding"".
Varoufakis, who frequently clashed with his hardline German counterpart at the time, Wolfgang Schaeuble, said the political center in Germany was under threat because of austerity.
""On paper, Germany is drowning in money ... but the German people have been victims of the same austerity as the rest of Europe. The result is low levels of investment,"" he said.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - As a child, Riham would wake up at night to her half-brother molesting her. Now she is one of seven women recounting their suffering in a play about sexual violence in Lebanon.
Recordings of the women's voices ring out as the audience moves from room to room in a house in Beirut. Women's rights group ABAAD put on the play entitled ""Shame on who?"" this weekend. 
In one room, a girl in white tries to stand up but keeps falling. In another, a woman talks to her mother but gets no response.
""I chose the idea of a house because most of these incidents happen from someone very close to the (victims),"" said Sahar Assaf, who conceived and directed the play. 
""Supposedly, the safest place for a woman should be her house.""
Riham, 35, recalls how she told her mother that her half-brother had abused her for 20 years since she was eight. ""She said that I was a liar and that I should never speak of such a thing.""
ABAAD head Ghida Anani said the play sought to empower survivors and encourage victims to report assaults.
The audience relives Ward's story from the husband's perspective as an actor paces in a bedroom. 
""We got married...but she started getting bothered because I used to like sleeping with her by force. from behind,"" he says.
""Once I gave her sleeping pills and tied her up...She couldn't do anything.""
Lebanon passed a long-awaited law in 2014 against domestic violence. But rights groups were outraged that authorities watered it down so much it fell short of criminalizing marital rape. Child marriage also remains legal. 
The United Nations says a third of women worldwide have suffered sexual or physical violence. 
A 2017 national ABAAD study found that one in four women have been raped in Lebanon. Less than a quarter of those who faced sexual assault reported it, the survey said.
""I felt that he was an animal eating my flesh,"" Hoda, whose neighbor raped her at 14, recalls in a recording in the play. 

""If I could turn back time the first thing I would do is go to a forensic physician to get evidence,"" she says. ""I would refuse to be the victim. He would pay for what he did.""

COLOMBO (Reuters) - A political impasse in Sri Lanka could be set to drag on longer after President Maithripala Sirisena said on Sunday he would not reinstate Ranil Wickremesinghe as prime minister even if he was able to prove his majority in parliament. 
""I will not appoint Ranil Wickremesinghe as prime minister in my lifetime. Even if they have a majority, I have told them not to propose him as I won't appoint him as prime minister,"" Sirisena told foreign media.
He said he replaced Wickremesinghe with pro-China former leader Mahinda Rajapaksa because of policy differences and a sharp rise in corruption. 
Sirisena said he planned to appoint a commission to investigate corruption and malpractice ""under Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's government."" 
A former cabinet spokesman under Wickremesinghe said Sirisena should be ashamed to make these allegations because he was the head of the cabinet under the prime minister Wickremesinghe.
""Why didn't he say this over all those last few years and investigate?"" Rajitha Seneratne said to Reuters.
Sagala Ratnayaka, former minister in charge of police under Wickremesinghe, said: ""If President Sirisena's wild allegations continue, I will be forced to divulge details on who interfered, when, where and how.""
Sri Lanka faces a deepening political crisis with the newly appointed Rajapaksa government refusing to resign despite losing two confidence votes. Sirisena has refused to accept the outcome of the votes saying proper parliamentary procedure has not been followed.
Sirisena dissolved parliament and ordered elections to break the deadlock, but the Supreme Court ordered a suspension of that decree earlier this month, as it hears petitions challenging the move as unconstitutional. A verdict is expected on Dec. 7.
He expected all problems to end with the Supreme Court ruling, he said. 
It was not clear how the impasse will end if the court finds his move to dissolve parliament unconstitutional. If it is constitutional, Sirisena can call for a general election. 
According to the island nation's constitution, the president has the power to appoint a prime minister who he thinks can command the parliament majority. It was not immediately clear how Sirisena could reject Wickremesinghe if he has the majority.
The president said he was ready to appoint anyone from Wickremesinghe's party as prime minister except Wickremesinghe himself and former army chief Sarath Fonseka who was a minister in the ousted cabinet.
""To appoint a prime minister, I should also like the person and should be able to work with the person,"" he said.

The Wickremesinghe-led center-right United National Party though, has so far refused to propose anyone but Wickremesinghe as prime minister.

The strike hit a suspected al Qaeda site in al-Bayda province, killing two people believed to be local leaders of the group along with four other militants, the officials said.
U.S. forces have repeatedly launched drone and air strikes against Yemen's al Qaeda branch, known as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).
The group has taken advantage of a nearly four year-old war between the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement and President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi's Saudi-backed government to try to strengthen its position in the impoverished country.

597,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2018 09:55AM ET</span>",Malaysia says former PM Najib's office ordered changes to 1MDB audit report,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - The office of former Malaysian premier Najib Razak ordered changes to a 2016 audit report of scandal-plagued state fund 1MDB, including removing mention of financier Low Taek Jho's presence at a board meeting, authorities said.
Financier Low has been described as a central player in the alleged corruption and money laundering at 1MDB, according to Malaysian and U.S. authorities investigating the fund. He had no official role in 1MDB, but advised on investments and negotiated deals for the fund, the authorities have said.
Najib, ousted in a May 9 election by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, is facing multiple charges of graft, abuse of power and criminal breach of trust related to 1MDB. He has pleaded not guilty to all the charges and has consistently denied wrongdoing.
In a statement dated Saturday, Malaysia's auditor-general Madinah Mohamad said ""several"" findings from the audit report submitted in February 2016 to Najib had been ""dropped and amended"".
""The former prime minister ordered the deletion of the paragraph containing two versions of the 1MDB financial statement for the year ended 2014 and directed an investigation to be carried out by the enforcement authorities,"" she said.
The audit report before the amendments has been submitted to the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) and the police for further investigation, Madinah said.
Law firm Shafee & Co, which is representing Najib, said in a statement on Sunday that it was ""standard procedure in any audit process that the auditors and the audited would ordinarily meet to discuss the draft report for clarification and to correct any inaccuracies, if any, before the report is made final"".
Shafee & Co said Low's presence at a 1MDB board meeting had been disclosed in parliament in December 2015 when the finance ministry stated that Low was there to represent Prince Turki Bin Abdullah as the owner of PetroSaudi Inc.
Madinah had said in Saturday's statement that Najib's private secretary had ""directed the former auditor general to drop the paragraph on the presence of Low Taek Jho in one of the 1MDB Board meetings on the ground that it is sensitive and to avoid the fact being twisted around by the opposition"".
MACC said in a separate statement that it had launched an investigation into the claims of amendments. It said it had gone over the original audit report to compare with the final draft report that was released by the state audit department, and will soon call in witnesses. 
In an interview with Reuters in June, Najib said he should not be blamed for the scandal at 1MDB and that he knew nothing about money from the state fund appearing in his personal account.
Low, who is at large, has previously maintained his innocence.
Malaysia, under the premiership of Najib, had classified the audit report in 2016 under the Officials Secrets Act when the fund's financial troubles were being investigated. The Mahathir government in May declassified the report that showed senior officials at 1MDB withheld information from its board.

Protesters chanted slogans and carried signs reading ""For Those Who Aren’t With Us"" and ""Justice"". In Madrid, the protest ended with a reading of the names of the 44 women killed in Spain last year in incidents of domestic violence.
Earlier this year, women across Spain went on strike and held hundreds of rallies to protest against gender inequality. The two largest unions said around 6 million women took part in the strike, the first of its kind to be held in Spain on International Women’s Day.

The camera operator, Piotr Wacowski, went undercover to film a neo-nazi group for a report broadcast in January by the network, which is controlled by U.S. entertainment firm Discovery Inc..
Poland's National Prosecutor's Office said on Sunday it was premature to accuse Wacowski and it had referred the case to a regional prosecutor's office for further examination, Polish state-news agency PAP reported.
A spokesman for Poland's internal security agency declined to comment. A government spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Earlier this week, U.S. ambassador to Poland Georgette Mosbacher told Polish lawmakers that U.S. Congress could withdraw support for Poland if the free press faced attacks, Polish news website Polska Times reported.
The U.S. embassy in Poland did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the TVN cameraman.
TVN24 is the most widely watched independent channel in Poland and the network has had run-ins before with the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, which has been accused by Brussels of trying to muzzle free media.
""We are treating this as an attempt to intimidate journalists,"" TVN said in a statement late on Saturday. ""The authors of the report acted in accordance with the standards of investigative journalism.""
The TVN footage showed members of a far-right group dressed in Nazi uniforms, burning a wooden swastika, making Nazi salutes and sharing a cake with a symbol of a swastika made of chocolate cookies.
Poland's broadcasting regulator KRRiT fined TVN last year over its coverage of protests in Poland's parliament, saying it was ""promoting illegal activities and encouraging behavior that threatens security"". 

The U.S. government said the regulator's actions undermined press freedom and KRRiT reversed the decision in January.

A senior security official said Alipur, a militia leader known as ""Commander Sword"" accused of serious human rights abuses, was arrested in a Hazara area of western Kabul, where a spate of suicide attacks by the radical Sunni Islamic State group has fed anger at perceived government indifference to violence against Hazaras.
Kabul police spokesman Basir Mujahid said at least 23 police had been injured in the demonstrations, three having been hit by bullets fired by supporters of Alipur. There were unconfirmed reports from people at the protest that some demonstrators had also been hurt.
While the conflict in Afghanistan kills thousands of people from all ethnic groups every year, Hazaras, have felt especially targeted and there has been growing resentment among many Hazaras against Sunni Pashtuns, traditionally Afghanistan's dominant ethnic group.
Mujahid said around 1,000 people gathered in western Kabul, burning a security checkpoint as the demonstration turned violent.
""The protesters are using whatever they have in their hands against police, there are armed men among protesters,"" he said.
A statement from the interior ministry said peaceful gatherings were legitimate but Sunday's protests had not been agreed with authorities beforehand.
Despite the accusations against him, Alipur has enjoyed the support of powerful Hazara leaders. He also remains popular with many in the mainly Shi'ite Hazara community who see him as a Robin Hood-style figure who defends his people while the government stands by.
In the central province of Bamyan, which is also home to many Hazaras, around 1,500 residents gathered to march toward the governor's compound and UN offices in a peaceful demonstration, Abdul Rahman Ahmadi, spokesman for Bamyan provincial governor said.
The incident follows days of fighting in the central province of Ghazni where local Hazara militias took up arms against the mainly Pashtun Taliban.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Swiss voters look set to reject a proposal to subsidize farmers who let the horns on their cows and goats grow rather than removing them, Swiss broadcaster SRF said on Sunday.
The initiative to preserve ""the dignity of livestock"" was led by farmer Armin Capaul, who has sparked a national debate on animal rights following a campaign which began nine years ago after he ""listened"" to his herd.
Preliminary results after the polls closed showed 53 percent against with 47 percent in favor, SRF reported.
Three-quarters of Swiss cows, a national symbol and tourist attraction, are dehorned or genetically hornless. Calves are dehorned with a red-hot iron which causes smoke and a burning odor in a procedure critics say causes pain.
The government had opposed the motion, which would have enshrined subsidies into the constitution, but agricultural workers were split, with even the Swiss farmers' union refraining from giving a recommendation to its 52,000 members.
Capaul collected more than 100,000 signatures to trigger a national vote after years of political lobbying failed. His supporters liken the dehorning to castrating cats or dogs and argue it is a safety issue for other animals and farmers.
The Swiss government opposed Capaul's move to get a 190 Swiss franc ($191.65) annual subsidy per horned animal for farmers, saying it would drain up to 30 million francs from its 3 billion franc annual agricultural budget.

""When you look at them they always hold their head high and are proud. When you remove the horns, they are sad,"" Capaul, a bearded 66-year-old, told Reuters last week on his small farm in northwestern Switzerland.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistani policewoman Suhai Aziz Talpur heard of the attack on the Chinese consulate in Karachi while driving to work. She rushed to the scene to find two of her colleagues dead, and a trio of insurgents attempting to blow their way into the building.
Her fast response and actions during the nearly two-hour assault on the diplomatic mission in the southern port city have been praised for saving countless lives, turning 30-year-old Talpur into an instant celebrity - and potential feminist icon - in Pakistan, where female police officers remain rare.
""The moment I arrived, an exchange of fire was taking place, blasts had been heard, smoke was emanating,"" Talpur, an assistant superintendent, told Reuters. 
Right away, she took up a position to fire at the attackers and began calling for reinforcements. 
""We started to advance inside the consulate and gradually neutralized the situation,"" she said.
Since the attack a picture of Talpur holding her pistol, flanked by commandos, has gone viral on social media in Pakistan. Her bravery has also earned her a nomination for the country's highest award for police officers. 
Friday's attack, claimed by separatist insurgents from the impoverished southwestern Pakistani province of Baluchistan, killed four people, including two police officers who Talpur said were the real heroes.
""The real credit goes to assistant sub-inspector Ashraf (Dawood) and constable Amir (Khan) who kept the attackers engaged and sacrificed their lives,"" she said.
Once the attack ended, Talpur was among the first police officers to enter the mission and began reassuring the staff. 
""When I entered there was a Chinese lady and three or four Pakistani men,"" she recalled. ""The Chinese lady hugged me and I told her 'you are in safe hands, things are under control'."" 
Talpur, who is scheduled to be promoted soon, will be one of only two female officers above the rank of assistant superintendent in the Sindh provincial police force. But she believes women have a big role to play in law enforcement.
""A woman can be a better detective than a man, we see each and every thing and memorize it better,"" she said.
Pakistan was recently ranked as the fourth worst country for women in a study conducted by the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security. But the police and military have recently been running programs to encourage more women in law enforcement roles and in the armed forces. 
Police officers are on the front lines of Pakistan's battle against militancy, often targeted by Islamist and insurgent groups. In 2016, 59 cadets were killed when militants stormed a police academy in the southwestern city of Quetta. The attack was claimed by Islamic State, but Pakistani authorities blamed it on local militant group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. 
In Karachi, officers have been targeted by Taliban militants and scores have been killed in a wave of urban violence that engulfed the city for two decades from the 1990s. 

Talpur, who hails from a small conservative village in the southern Sindh province, was studying to be a chartered accountant when she decided her chosen profession was too ""dull"" and joined the police instead.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's democratic opposition is aiming to win back a crucial legislative council seat in an election on Sunday that will restore some of its veto power at a time when the China-ruled city's freedoms are under strain.
The city's opposition Democrats squandered a chance in March to regain their veto power, garnering only two of four seats in a by-election and leaving them one seat short of blocking most bills in the 70-seat chamber, now largely controlled by pro-Beijing allies.
After 156 years of British colonial rule, Hong Kong returned to China in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" formula guaranteeing it a high degree of autonomy and the promise of eventual universal suffrage.
While the Democrats have enjoyed strong public backing in the past from a public aggrieved by China's creeping control of the Asian financial hub, they've struggled against a far larger and better funded pro-Beijing camp and unprecedented moves by authorities to curb electoral freedoms.
A pro-independence political party was banned this year, while several promising democracy activists were barred from contesting various polls after being deemed ideologically unsuitable for public office.
Sunday's by-election, and that in March, were triggered when six pro-democracy lawmakers were ousted over invalid oaths of office. Critics said the move was politically motivated, raising fresh questions over Hong Kong's reputation as a relative haven for freedoms not allowed anywhere in mainland China.
""The democrats have had so many seats taken away from them,"" said Wa Lam, a 47-year-old salesman who voted with his wife.
""They're getting weaker and weaker, but I hope they can still hold on and help guard the city."" 
A higher turnout is expected to help the democrats, but by late afternoon, only around a quarter of the 490,000 eligible voters had cast a ballot. 
""Apathy is our biggest enemy so far,"" Lee Cheuk-yan, a veteran former pro-democracy lawmaker and the main candidate for the democratic camp, told Reuters. 
""This election is crucial ... we can further resist the erosion of our power base by the (Chinese) Communist party. I think most people don't want Hong Kong to become another Chinese city,"" added Lee.
Lee's main rival will be pro-establishment Rebecca Chan Hoi-yan, a former television journalist with broadcaster TVB. In the run-up to the election Chan was ensnared in several controversies including plagiarizing the work of democratic politicians.
The poll comes at a time of increasing international concern toward a perceived deterioration in Hong Kong civil liberties.
Nine activists including lawmakers and university professors are now facing public nuisance charges stemming from the massive pro-democracy ""Occupy Central"" protests in 2014. Their landmark trial could see them jailed for up to seven years.
A senior editor for the Financial Times, Victor Mallet, was also effectively expelled from the city in recent months, soon after he helped host a speech by an independence activist at the Hong Kong Foreign Correspondents' Club. 

The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission warned in a congressional report this month that China had ""ramped up its interference"" and had ""closed down the political space for pro-democracy activists to express discontent"".

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Voters in Taiwan have delivered a strong rebuke to the island's pro-independence ruling party in local elections, emboldening the China-friendly opposition, one of whose main figures says he will now reach out to Beijing to forge more friendly ties.
The ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP) suffered major elections loss on Saturday, losing two key mayoral races, while the opposition Kuomintang took or retained control of 15 cities and counties, leaving the DPP with only six.
With little more than a year before presidential elections, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who has had tense relations with Beijing since her election in 2016, on Saturday took responsibility for her party's losses and resigned as DPP chairwoman.
The Kuomintang mayor-elect of the southern port city of Kaohsiung, formerly a DPP stronghold, moved swiftly on Saturday night to reach out to China, telling local media he will set up a working group on China relations and will break down barriers.
""We have no walls around our hearts,"" said Han Kuo-yu, who has previously described Taiwan independence as being ""more scary"" than syphilis.
The Kuomintang has sent delegations to China since Tsai took office, where they have been warmly received. China has refused to have direct contacts with Tsai's administration. 
China, which claims Taiwan as a wayward province, said the elections showed people wanted peaceful relations with Beijing.
""The results reflected the strong will of the Taiwan public in hoping to continue to share the benefits of the peaceful development of relations across the Taiwan Strait, and their strong wish in hoping to improve the island's economy and people's wellbeing,"" said a statement by China's policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office and carried by state media.
Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council said China should respect Taiwan's internal affairs and democracy and not ""interpret the expectations of Taiwan's people toward relations across the Taiwan Strait"".
In an implicit warning to China not to contact newly-elected Kuomintang officials, the council said deliberately political Chinese approaches to local governments and people would not help ""positive interactions"" with Taiwan. 
Voters also rejected a referendum that would have seen the island join the 2020 Tokyo Olympics as Taiwan, rather than ""Chinese Taipei"", a move which would have angered Beijing.
China's Taiwan Affairs Office said it showed voters ""putting Taiwanese athletes' interests at stake is against people's will"". ""The attempts of 'Taiwan independence' are doomed to fail,"" it added.
The WeChat account of the overseas edition of the Communist Party's official People's Daily said Han had realized one important reality: ""Taiwan will only be good if relations across the Taiwan Strait are good"".
China is suspicious that Tsai wants formal independence, a red line for Beijing which regards Taiwan as its own.
Tsai says she wants only the status quo with China, but will defend Taiwan's security. Chinese law mandates the use of force to prevent the island from seceding.
Tensions across the Taiwan Strait have heightened with China conducting military drills around the island and snatching away Taiwan's dwindling number of diplomatic allies.
DPP Secretary General Hung Yao-fu, asked on Saturday about whether the China factor had played a role in influencing the elections, reiterated there had been a problem with ""fake news"".
""I think this time was a deep lesson, in terms of fake news messing up with a lot of people's judgment or not getting clear information,"" he told reporters. 
""This is a global problem not just Taiwan's unique problem.""
SPECIAL MARRIAGE EQUALITY LAW
Taiwanese voters on Saturday also rejected a referendum on legalizing same-sex marriage, another blow for Tsai, who in her 2016 campaign promised marriage equality. However, she has made little progress on the issue.
In an Asian first, Taiwan's constitutional court declared in May of last year that same-sex couples had the right to legally marry, and set a two-year deadline for legalization.
But voters instead backed a referendum that defines marriage as between a man and a woman.
""This is a victory for all the people who support family values and education for the next generation,"" the Coalition for the Happiness of Our Next Generation, a group opposed to same-sex marriage, said in a statement.
Taiwan cabinet spokeswoman Kolas Yotaka told Reuters a special law will be drafted for marriage equality, and that the government continued to support the issue.
Rights activists called a special law for same-sex marriage ""discriminatory"" and that the referendum was illegal and against the constitution.
Dozens of supporters for marriage equality gathered in the capital Taipei early on Sunday, with some weeping as the result became clear. Chi Chia-wei, a veteran gay rights activist, said he remained positive about the fight for equality. 
""The ones opposing us are getting fewer and fewer,"" he told Reuters.

Taiwan's capital Taipei celebrates an annual gay pride parade that showcases the vibrancy of its lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. The one-week celebration in October, largest in Asia, contributes more than $3.3 million to the economy, according to Taipei Times.

DUBAI (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates will offer long-term visas to rich property investors, senior scientists and entrepreneurs in an effort to support its economy and real estate market, which have been hurt by low oil prices.
Until now, visas for foreigners to live in the Arab world's second biggest economy have generally been valid for only a few years, and have depended on the main visa holder in each family remaining employed. The government said in May it planned to ease that policy.
Detailed rules approved by the cabinet on Saturday offer five-year residency to owners of UAE real estate worth at least 5 million dirhams ($1.4 million), as long as ownership is not based on loans, state news agency WAM reported.
Renewable 10-year visas will be provided to foreigners with investments in the UAE of at least 10 million dirhams, if non-real estate assets account for at least 60 percent of the total. Investors can bring spouses and children into the country.
Other rules offer five-year visas to entrepreneurs and 10-year visas for scientists and researchers with top qualifications. Outstanding students can stay for five years.
The UAE is currently locked in a diplomatic dispute with Britain after a UK academic was jailed for life on spying charges.
Share prices of UAE property firms, beaten down by slumping real estate prices, moved little on Sunday in response to the new visa rules. Analysts said they were probably not enough on their own to change investment or employment trends.
Some parts of the economy that rely on white-collar professionals - a class of people who might buy homes in the UAE - are seeing stagnant or even falling employment. 
Jean-Paul Pigat, head of research at Lighthouse Research in Dubai, said the new visas were a step in the right direction but: ""In order to have a large impact on domestic demand and sectors such as real estate, the policies might need to be broadened so that larger numbers of residents can qualify.""
Also, the visas do not provide a path to UAE citizenship, which would be a sensitive political issue in a country where well over two-thirds of the roughly 9.4 million residents are believed to be foreign. 
Nishit Lakhotia, head of research at financial company SICO in Bahrain, said the new visa system was positive but unlikely to have any immediate material impact.
""There are much less stringent investment requirements in some of Eastern European countries or even Turkey to get citizenship, not just residency permits,"" he said.

In another step to aid the real estate market, the UAE government approved in September a law allowing expatriates to stay in the country after retirement if they own a property valued at about $545,000.

616,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2018 02:05AM ET</span>","Voters to decide on 'Swiss law, not foreign judges' proposal","By John Revill
ZURICH(Reuters) - The Swiss vote on Sunday on a proposal to give Switzerland's laws clear priority over international law - a move supporters say would reinforce its sovereignty but which critics claim would deeply damage its ties with the rest of the world.
The ""Swiss law, not foreign judges"" measure calls for a provision to be added to the national constitution giving it explicit precedence over international agreements.
Where there is a clash between the two, Switzerland would have to update its international obligations so they complied with its constitution. If no deal is reached the country could quit the international agreement, says the referendum proposal, also known as the Self Determination Initiative.
Backers argue that neutral Switzerland's historic autonomy is being watered down by its participation in international agreements covering areas like environmental protection, police cooperation, air transport and trade.
Their campaign, spearheaded by politicians from the right-wing Swiss People's Party (SVP), said such arrangements endanger the long tradition of direct democracy in Switzerland, where citizens have the final say on political decisions via referendums.
""Our voting rights should continue to apply in the future,"" said Magdalena Martullo-Blocher, an SVP member of the Swiss parliament and daughter of billionaire Christoph Blocher, former vice-president of the party and its most prominent figure.
""Direct democracy is a cornerstone of Switzerland as a business location.""
Debate over whether sovereignty has been eroded has intensified in recent years, as Switzerland struggles to clarify its relationship with the European Union, currently governed by a tangle of different bilateral pacts.
The SVP, the largest party in the Swiss parliament and holder of two of the seven seats in the Swiss cabinet, says the initiative would empower citizens and free them from interference from international bodies like the EU.
They are opposed by the Swiss government, business groups and most other parties, which say the proposal would force Switzerland to cancel existing treaties, weaken human rights protections and hurt its economy.
They say a ""yes"" vote would mean Switzerland having to renegotiate thousands of treaties it has signed, undermining an open economy which is highly dependent on global trade.
""The international standing of Switzerland would be hurt,"" said Jan Atteslander of business lobby group Economiesuisse.
""Other countries could doubt whether Switzerland would stick by its words, or fulfill its obligations in future.""
Polls show the referendum proposal is likely to fail, with 58 percent of respondents to a Tamedia questionnaire saying they opposed it and a poll by market researcher GFS Bern for SRF putting opposition at 61 percent.
Switzerland will also vote on Sunday on whether to subsidize farmers who let cows and goats grow their horns naturally, amid debate over whether the practice of removing horns harms the animals.

By Katie Paul
ABU DHABI (Reuters) - A senior Saudi prince cast doubt upon the reported CIA finding that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul last month, saying the agency could not be counted on to reach a credible conclusion.
""The CIA is not necessarily the highest standard of veracity or accuracy in assessing situations. The examples of that are multitude,"" Prince Turki al-Faisal, a senior member of the royal family, told journalists in Abu Dhabi on Saturday.
The prince, a former Saudi intelligence chief who has also served as ambassador to the United States, said the agency's conclusion that Iraq possessed chemical weapons before the U.S. invasion in 2003 showed it could be unreliable.
""That was the most glaring of inaccurate and wrong assessments, which led to a full-scale war with thousands being killed,"" he said, speaking at an event hosted by the Beirut Institute think tank.
""I don't see why the CIA is not on trial in the United States. This is my answer to their assessment of who is guilty and who is not and who did what in the consulate in Istanbul.""
The CIA has concluded that Prince Mohammed ordered the operation to kill Khashoggi, as first reported by the Washington Post, and briefed other parts of the U.S. government on its findings, sources told Reuters last week.
U.S. President Donald Trump has disputed that the agency reached a conclusion on the murder, saying instead ""they have feelings certain ways.""
A Turkish newspaper also reported on Thursday that CIA director Gina Haspel signaled to Turkish officials that the agency had a recording of a call in which the crown prince gave instructions to ""silence"" the journalist.
Khashoggi was killed at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 in an operation that Turkish authorities have said was ordered by the highest level of Saudi leadership, prompting the kingdom's biggest political crisis in a generation.
After offering numerous contradictory explanations, Riyadh said Khashoggi was killed and his body dismembered after negotiations to persuade him to return to Saudi Arabia failed.

The kingdom's public prosecutor is seeking the death penalty for five suspects charged in the murder, but has said Prince Mohammed had no prior knowledge of the operation.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Dozens of former Australian judges published an open letter to Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Sunday calling for a national anti-corruption body to restore public trust in the country's democratic process.
The letter, written by 34 former judges including Sir Gerard Brennan, the former chief justice of the High Court of Australia, the country's peak court, said there is public suspicion that corruption permeates many government actions.
""Secrecy is at the core of corrupt conduct,"" they said in the letter, published in the Sunday Age newspaper.
""Existing federal integrity agencies lack the necessary jurisdiction, powers and know-how to investigate properly the impartiality and bona-fides of decisions made by, and conduct of, the federal government and public sector.""
""A National Integrity Commission is urgently needed to fill the gaps in our integrity system and restore trust in our democracy.""
Public concerns over possible corruption in government decision-making have heightened in recent years.
Transparency International Australia, an anti-corruption organization, conducted a survey in June that found 85 percent of people believe at least some members of the national parliament are corrupt, and two-thirds of Australians support the creation of a national anti-corruption body.
A government minister in the state of New South Wales was jailed last year for wilful misconduct in public office, after gifting a mining license without a competitive tender.
Concerns have also been raised over senior public servants winning lucrative consultancies or board positions from firms which then win contracts from their previous departments, said AJ Brown, professor of public policy at Griffith University and board member of Transparency International.
The judges' letter was co-ordinated by progressive think tank The Australia Institute, which worked with legal experts to design an anti-corruption body.
Australia Institute researcher Hannah Aulby said their goal was to support transparency in the political process. ""There's not enough accountability,"" she told Reuters by telephone.
Independent MP Cathy McGowan plans to table a bill to establish a national anti-corruption body in federal parliament when it resumes on Monday. The Labor opposition supports a national anti-corruption body but the move is opposed by the ruling conservative minority government.
Attorney General Christian Porter told Reuters the model would give extraordinary powers against public servants with a definition of ""corruption"" that was too broad.
""Those powers could be used without proper checks and balances,"" he said in an emailed statement.

AYODHYA, India (Reuters) - Amid heavy security, tens of thousands of monks and activists from Hindu nationalist groups began converging on the Indian town of Ayodhya on Sunday to demand the construction of a temple on a disputed religious site.
Over 200,000 people are expected near the site where a Hindu mob in 1992 pulled down a 16th-century mosque, sparking deadly religious riots that killed some 2,000 people in one of India's worst communal violence since the partition in 1947.
More than 900 extra police and a large number of paramilitary, including elite commandos, have been stationed at Ayodhya, said Vivek Tripathi, spokesman for the Uttar Pradesh police. ""We're monitoring the entire town by CCTV and drone cameras,"" Tripathi said.
In the run-up to a general election due by May 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and many Hindu outfits affiliated with the BJP have ratcheted up their demand for a new temple at the disputed site which most Hindus believe was the birthplace of warrior-God Lord Ram.
Hindu groups point to evidence there was a temple before a mosque was built by a Muslim ruler in 1528.
""The mosque was a slight on Hindus and it's a shame that we've failed to build a temple on one of the most holy sites for Hindus,"" said Sharad Sharma, spokesman for the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), or the World Hindu Council, which has close ties with the BJP.
Hindus are getting impatient and the time has come to build a grand temple for Lord Ram, Sharma said.
The group gathering on Sunday will urge the government to introduce a legislation to pave the way for a temple, said Bablu Khan, an elected BJP council member in Ayodhya.
Both Hindu and Muslim groups have petitioned India's Supreme Court to help resolve the issue. The top court has sought more time to give its verdict.
Sharma said the delay has disappointed India's majority Hindu community which can not wait endlessly for a verdict.
Both the BJP and VHP and their parent movement, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, have asked the government to issue an executive order to build a temple and bypass the Supreme Court. 
The heavily fortified site, which looks like a small garrison town, is under the control of the Supreme Court.
Sunday's congregation in Ayodhya would be followed up with bigger gatherings in New Delhi, India's capital, said Sharma.
The build-up of Hindu religious leaders and right wing political activists has also raised questions about the safety of Muslims who live in Ayodhya and other nearby areas.
Zafaryab Jilani, a senior member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, said it's incumbent upon the state administration to ensure the safety of the community.

The administration is geared up to protect every single individual in the town, said Anil Pathak, district chief of Faizabad, where the Ayodhya town is located.

The so-called Camp Fire all but obliterated the mountain community of Paradise, 175 miles (280 km) northeast of San Francisco, on Nov. 8, killing at least 85 people and destroying nearly 14,000 homes. The death toll was increased late Saturday night by one, according to the Butte County Sheriff's Office. 
Some 475 people from Paradise and surrounding communities remain unaccounted for, according to the Butte County Sheriff's Office.
Hundreds of police officers and volunteers have searched in and around Paradise since the fire swept through the area.
The 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm) of rain that fell there during the last few days turned ash from the thousands of destroyed homes into slurry, complicating the work of finding bodies reduced to bone fragments.
Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea has warned that remains of some victims may never be found. 
Teams resumed their search on Saturday, Butte County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Miranda Bowersox said, ahead of more rains that are expected to start on Wednesday.
A total of 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm) of rain is forecast for areas burned by the Camp Fire from Wednesday through Saturday, said meteorologist David Roth of the federal Weather Prediction Center.
Rainfall earlier this week did not trigger any large debris flows, but Roth said the danger of a mudslide will remain far into the future for hillsides that flames have stripped of vegetation. ""Any heavy rain event really for the next few to several years would be a problem there,"" he said. 
Authorities said they would lift evacuation orders in some areas south of Paradise on Saturday.
The city of Paradise was a popular destination for retirees, with people ages 65 or older accounting for a quarter of its 27,000 residents. Most of the victims of the fire identified so far were of retirement age.
With help from rainfall, firefighters have contained 98 percent of the blaze, which torched 154,000 acres (62,000 hectares) - an area five times the size of San Francisco, officials said.
Investigators have yet to determine the cause of the fire. 

Thousands of people forced to flee Paradise spent Thanksgiving in warehouses in the nearby city of Chico, or with friends or relatives in nearby towns.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The Labor government in the Australian state of Victoria won an unexpectedly large majority in an election that analysts say is a warning to the country's ruling conservative government ahead of national polls due in six months.
Victoria is Australia's second most populous state, and the poll is seen as a barometer of voter sentiment towards the nation's conservative Liberal and National government. 
The governing coalition has been a minority government since October when they lost their one-seat majority after former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, ousted by conservatives in a party-room coup, resigned.
In Victoria, the incumbent Labor government campaigned on big infrastructure projects including rail, roads and schools, while the opposition Liberal Party focused on crime, and law and order.
Labor, which went into the election with a one-seat majority in the 88-seat Victorian legislative assembly, is expected to take up to 55 seats once counting is finished, based on figures from the Victorian Electoral Commission. 
With just over half the votes counted in the early hours of Sunday morning, the Victorian Electoral Commission website showed Labor leading their Liberal rivals by 42.8 percent to 30.4 percent.
By Saturday night the tally was decisive enough for Labor Premier Daniel Andrews to declare victory, although official results will not be announced until all votes are counted.
Andrews said on Sunday morning that his victory was a result of delivering on commitments. 
""Victorians would look at the results and be, well, from our point of view, be very pleasantly surprised at the magnitude,"" Andrews said on ABC TV’s ""Insiders.""
University of Sydney emeritus politics professor Rodney Tiffen said the loss would be a warning to the national Liberal party, and said it could exacerbate the ideological split in the Liberal party over social issues and addressing climate change. 
""I would think it's a very bad omen for the Liberals federally,"" he told Reuters by telephone. ""It continues a sense that they're on a losing streak.""
Australia's most populous state of New South Wales holds an election on March 23 next year, and a Federal election is due by mid-May.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan voters were set to back a referendum that defines marriage as between a man and a woman, dealing a blow to the self-ruled island's reputation for liberalism in Asia amid a heated debate over marriage equality. 
In Asia's first such ruling, Taiwan's constitutional court declared in May 2017 that same-sex couples had the right to legally marry, and set a two-year deadline for legalization. 
But the island's election authority earlier this year approved contradicting referendum petitions from both conservative and rights groups.
While the election authority had not yet announced the final results of Saturday's referendum, more than six million voters approved a series of initiatives opposing marriage equality, passing a threshold needed for a public vote. 
The vote presents a major defeat for rights activists who had campaigned for equal marriage.
""This is a victory for all the people who support family value and the education for the next generation,"" the Coalition for the Happiness of Our Next Generation, a group opposed to same-sex marriage, said in a statement. 
""The referendum is illegal and against the constitution, and has sharply divided and harmed the society,"" the Marriage Equality Coalition Taiwan said in a statement. 
""The result showed that most people were misled by false information from anti-gay groups,"" it said. 
The government has said the ruling of May 2017 will not be challenged by referendum results. But the authorities are expected to enact a special law for same-sex unions after Saturday's vote. 
The vote presents a challenge to President Tsai Ing-wen, who activists say has backed away from a promise of marriage equality which she made in the run-up to elections in 2016. 
The issue has divided Taiwan, at family dining room tables, online and on the streets, with large campaigns and rallies on both sides of the debate.

Taiwan hosts the region's largest annual gay pride parade showcasing its lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community.

626,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2018 12:23PM ET</span>",Taiwan president quits as party chair after local election setback,"By Yimou Lee and Jess Macy Yu
TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen resigned as chairwoman of the ruling pro-independence Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP) after it suffered a major electoral defeat on Saturday, losing two of the island's most important city posts in mayoral elections.
The results of the polls, being held just over a year before Taiwan's next presidential election, are likely to please China, which claims self-ruled and proudly democratic Taiwan as its own and has ramped up pressure on Tsai and her administration since she took office in 2016.
In the run-up to the elections, Tsai and her government said repeatedly that China was trying to sway voters with ""political bullying"" and ""fake news"", accusations that Beijing denied.
The DPP lost control of the mayoralties in Taiwan's second-most populous city Taichung and the key battleground of Kaohsiung in the south, which it held for two decades and played a central role in Taiwan's pro-democracy movement in the 1970s.
Both were won by the China-friendly opposition, the Kuomintang, which once ruled China before fleeing to Taiwan at the end of a civil war with the Communists in 1949.
Tsai said the DPP would reflect on the defeat, but she vowed to press on.
""Continuing reforms, freedom and democracy, and protecting the country's sovereignty are the mission that the DPP won't abandon,"" she told reporters.
She said she would not accept the resignation of her premier William Lai, who had offered to quit earlier in the evening.
""TRAGIC DEFEAT""
The DPP has now been left in control of only six of Taiwan's cities and counties, compared with at least 15 for the Kuomintang.
The party held on in two of its other strongholds, however, keeping Tainan in the south and Taoyuan in the north.
""This is a tragic defeat for the DPP,"" Yao Chia-wen, a senior adviser to the president, told Reuters. 
""But this is not support for the Kuomintang from the people. This is the people's disappointment in the DPP,"" he said, citing slower-than-expected initiatives that have drawn criticism including pension and justice reforms.
Votes were still being counted in Taiwan's affluent capital Taipei, where the incumbent mayor Ko Wen-je, an independent, is in a close race with the Kuomintang's Ting Shou-chung, and the DPP is running a distant third.
Kaohsiung's Kuomintang mayor-elect, Han Kuo-yu, who described the city as ""outdated and poor"" while on the campaign trail, told a rally he would go all-out to boost its economy.
""We must immediately roll up our sleeves and get to work,"" Han said, speaking of what was once one of the world's busiest ports but which has lost much of its business to China. 
There was no immediate reaction from Beijing to the poll results, where state media simply noted Tsai's resignation as party chairwoman ""to take responsibility for the party's performance in Taiwan's local elections"".
A spokesperson for the U.S. State Department praised Taiwan for ""demonstrating the strength of their vibrant democratic system through a successful round of elections.""
HIGH TURNOUT
Taiwan television stations reported a high turnout, with some polling stations in parts of Taipei and Kaohsiung remaining open past 4 p.m (0800 GMT) when the polls were due to close.
Candidates fanned out across the island to shake hands and canvass votes, and held noisy, colorful rallies that have become the hallmarks of Taiwan's vibrant democracy, in marked contrast to China where the Communist Party tolerates no dissent to its rule.
Tensions across the Taiwan Strait have heightened, with China conducting military drills around the island and snatching away Taiwan's dwindling number of diplomatic allies.
Tsai's domestic reform initiatives, from the island's pension scheme to labor law, have also come under intense voter scrutiny recently.
Confidence in the government has waned in recent months after reform moves upset both the opposition and some supporters, who said Tsai had backed away from promises to reduce the deficit and cut pollution.
Underscoring Tsai's challenge are a series of public votes also held on Saturday on whether to make same-sex marriage legal, an issue which has deeply divided Taiwan.
Voters looked set to back a referendum defining marriage as between and a man and a woman, dealing a sharp blow to Taiwan's position as a bastion of liberalism in Asia.
Tsai has made little progress despite campaigning on a promise of marriage equality in the run-up to elections in 2016.
In Asia's first such ruling, Taiwan's constitutional court declared in May last year that same-sex couples had the right to legally marry, and set a two-year deadline for legalization.
Voters were also asked whether the island should join the 2020 Tokyo Olympics as Taiwan, rather than ""Chinese Taipei"" – the name agreed under a compromise signed in 1981.
A vote to compete under a Taiwan banner would further rile Beijing, which has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control.
That referendum appeared to have been blocked, with most people voting against re-naming Taiwan's Olympic team.

Final results for all the referendum votes are not expected until early on Sunday, according to election officials.

The Central European University (CEU) has announced it will move to Vienna unless Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government agrees by December 1 to ensure the legal framework for its continued operation in Hungary.
CEU has offered U.S.-accredited degree programs to thousands of students from ex-communist eastern Europe for almost three decades.
Participants in the demonstration held outside the historic buildings of Corvinus University on the bank of the Danube river, said the academic climate symbolized by the CEU, one which celebrates free thought and open debate, needed to be defended.
""CEU represents free education and diversity... I am fed up with what is going on here,"" said Maria Palmai, 63, a retired bank official.
More than 3,500 CEU alumni are currently working and teaching in Hungary. 
Students of other universities including ELTE and Corvinus also attended the rally.
""If we do not stand up for CEU, the next time they will come for ELTE. Nobody will stand up for ELTE, and if they go for Corvinus, nobody will stand up stand up for Corvinus, "" said Eyad, 30, a Jordanian who studies film making at ELTE.
CEU's plan to move U.S. accredited programs, the bulk of its courses, to Vienna follows a lengthy battle with Orban's government, including legal changes widely seen as targeting CEU.
The conservative nationalist government has accused the Hungarian-born Soros of plotting to destroy European civilization by flooding the continent with immigrants. Soros says his support for refugees is part of a humanitarian mission. 
The university looks set to move as the government has ruled out any concessions to CEU.

Mugabe, 94, who ruled the southern African nation for nearly four decades since independence from Britain in 1980, was forced to resign in November 2017 after an army coup.
Mnangagwa told ruling ZANU-PF supporters at a rally in Murombedzi, Mugabe's village some 100 km (60 miles) west of the capital Harare, his predecessor had been due to return on Oct. 15 but that his poor health had delayed the journey.
He did not say what treatment Mugabe had been undergoing.
""We have just received a message that he is better now and will return on Nov. 30. He can no longer walk but we will continue taking care of him,"" Mnangagwa said, referring to Mugabe by his totem name Gushungo.
During his later years in power, Mugabe made several medical trips to Singapore.
Officials often said he was being treated for a cataract, denying frequent reports by private local media that he had prostate cancer.
Mnangagwa, who won a disputed July 30 presidential vote, repeated the army's previous justification for last year's coup, saying his former mentor Mugabe had been surrounded by criminals.

When the army rolled its tanks into Harare, military leaders said they were targeting ""criminals around the president."" A bitter Mugabe said later, however, that the army's action had forced him to resign.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - An 11th-hour deal on Saturday to answer Spanish demands for a big say on Gibraltar after Britain leaves the EU has salvaged an EU summit which will now go ahead as planned on Sunday to deliver a Brexit accord.
With British Prime Minister Theresa May due to meet EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker and summit chair Donald Tusk at 6 p.m. (1700 GMT) and 7:15 p.m. respectively, Tusk secured a deal with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who had been threatening to scupper the consensus by staying away on Sunday.
""After the phone call between (Tusk) and (Sanchez) a few minutes ago, we are closer to tomorrow's (European Council),"" Tusk's spokesman Preben Aamann said on Twitter.
The British government released a letter from the British ambassador to the EU Tim Barrow to the head of Tusk's secretariat spelling out that Britain would make no presumption that any future EU-UK trade pact would apply to Gibraltar.
Sanchez was due to make a statement in Madrid at 3 p.m. (1400 GMT) to outline the agreement, diplomats said, after British and Spanish negotiators talked through the night with EU officials trying to broker a deal that would reassure Madrid on how the Brexit treaties would apply to Gibraltar and give it a clear say on their application -- without reopening the texts.
Those assurances should form part of a brief statement agreed by the 27 EU leaders and added to the minutes of Sunday morning's hour-long meeting before the 27 meet May at 11 a.m.
""Negotiations went on through the night with Spain and Britain,"" one diplomatic source said. ""In a telephone conversation just now, Tusk and Sanchez reached an agreement on Gibraltar. The summit will go ahead.""
Many Brussels insiders view Sanchez's gambit as summit grandstanding for domestic purposes -- he faces a regional election next weekend in Andalusia, the province to which Spaniards argue Britain's 300-year-old naval base and 30,000 citizens on the rock of Gibraltar rightly belong.

The biggest obstacle to the Brexit accord overall is the vehement opposition in the British parliament. Without its approval, Britain could leave the bloc on March 29 without an agreement to mitigate economic and legal disruption.

The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said shells hit Jarjanaz village which lies on the inner edge of the 15-20 km (9-13 mile) deep zone.
The deal to create the demilitarized zone, running along the contact line between insurgent and government territory, staved off an army offensive against Idlib. 
Intermittent exchanges of fire have broken out in northwest Syria since the agreement between Russia, a key Damascus ally, and Turkey, which backs some rebel factions.
The United Nations says nearly 3 million people live in the northwest region and has warned against a battle to restore state rule there.
Among an array of factions controlling Idlib, the dominant force is Tahrir al-Sham, an Islamist alliance led by fighters formerly linked to al Qaeda.
Earlier this month, Moscow accused insurgents of trying to wreck the deal, while rebels accused the Syrian army and its allies of attacking the region.

Mawlawi Abdul Basir Haqqani, the leader of Kabul Ulema Council was shot dead. His body was found near a residential area of Kabul, a senior police official said on conditions of anonymity. 
Haqqani's murder comes when members of the council are coping with the aftermath of a devastating suicide attack that killed 55 religious scholars and wounded over 90 men who had gathered in a banquet hall in Kabul to celebrate the birth anniversary of Prophet Mohammad.
Afghanistan's Ulema Council is a government-funded, but autonomous body of religious clerics. It was set up after the fall of the Taliban in 2002 and has a presence across 34 provinces of Afghanistan. Haqqani was leading the Kabul chapter of the council.
As of 2018, the council had more than 2,500 members — religious scholars and clerics, both Sunni and Shi'ite.
Their role is mainly to perform religious ceremonies, advise the government on matters of Islamic jurisprudence. Members of the council have supported a peaceful solution to the Afghan war, but the Taliban views them as ""religious puppets of the Western-backed government"". 
On Friday, 27 members of Afghanistan's army were killed when a suicide bomber detonated his explosives inside a mosque during Friday prayers in southeastern Khost province.

Gaurav Bhatia, the managing director of Sotheby's India, has agreed to take leave of absence as a formal inquiry is underway into anonymous allegations on social media, Sotheby's said in a statement, just days ahead of its first auction in the country.
""Harassment of any type has no place at Sotheby's and we will thoroughly investigate these allegations with Gaurav's full cooperation,"" it added.
Bhatia did not respond to an email seeking comment.
Sotheby's did not say who would conduct the probe into the allegations against Bhatia. It plans to go ahead with its inaugural auction scheduled in India's financial capital of Mumbai on Nov 29. 
The #MeToo campaign against sexual harassment, which began in the United States' entertainment industry, gained traction in India earlier this year after Bollywood actor Tanushree Dutta accused a co-actor of sexually harassing her on a movie set a decade ago.
The movement has since spread with prominent journalists, film personalities, and executives being named.

""I confirm that Amadou Koufa was killed during the operation,"" Malian army spokesman Colonel Diarran Kone told Reuters. He declined to elaborate.
France's army had said on Friday that Koufa may have been killed in the operation in the central Mopti region that ""put out of action"" about 30 Islamist militants.
Koufa, a radical preacher, was one of the top deputies to Iyad Ag Ghali, the leader of Mali's most prominent jihadi group, Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), which has repeatedly attacked soldiers and civilians in Mali and neighboring Burkina Faso.
Those attacks have shifted Mali's six-year-old Islamist insurgency from the remote desert north closer to its populous south and prompted France and the United States to deploy thousands of troops across West Africa's semi-arid region.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Wednesday the United States was setting up the posts to help keep the focus on clearing the final Islamic State militant strongholds in Syria.
The United States has long complained that tension between Turkey and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) - which includes the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia - has at times slowed progress on the fight against Islamic State.
Akar said he told U.S. Chief of Staff Joseph Dunford and other U.S. officials during a recent visit to Canada that setting up the posts would have a very negative impact on perceptions of the United States in Turkey. 
""During our talks with both political and civilian interlocutors we repeatedly expressed our unease in various ways,"" he said. ""I think actions like this will make the complicated situation in the region even more complicated"".
Turkey is angry at U.S. support for the YPG, which it views as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) waging a decades-long insurgency on Turkish soil. The PKK is designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union.
""Nobody should doubt that the Turkish Armed forces and the Republic of Turkey will take the necessary steps against all kinds of risks and threats from across its borders,"" he said.
""We expect our U.S. allies to immediately cut their ties with the terrorist YPG, who are not in the slightest bit different from the PKK,"" Akar added.
Islamic State is still present in eastern Syria in a pocket east of the Euphrates River near the border with Iraq.

President Donald Trump's administration hopes that the U.S.-backed fight against Islamic State in its last foothold in northeastern Syria will end within months. But a top U.S. diplomat recently said American forces will remain to ensure the ""enduring defeat"" of the militant group.

The AK Party and the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) formed an alliance before presidential elections last June, but were subsequently at loggerheads over a disagreement about the MHP's call for an amnesty for some jailed criminals.
A month ago MHP leader Devlet Bahceli said his party would not seek an alliance with the AK Party in the March 2019 municipal elections which are being held across Turkey.
At the time his comments triggered a weakening of the lira over concerns that it would lead to political instability.
However, Bahceli announced a change of position on Saturday saying the MHP would not put forward city mayoral candidates for Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir, Turkey's three biggest cities.
""Whoever the Justice and Development Party's (AKP) candidates are in these three big cities our support will be total,"" Bahceli told officials from his party in a speech in Antalya. 
The MHP's candidates in other municipalities across Turkey would continue to stand, he said, adding there was no ""secret agreement"" behind his party's decision.
It was not clear what prompted the change in Bahceli's position. 
Bahceli and his MHP party had been staunch critics of Erdogan's AK Party before they reached agreement on their election alliance this year. Their alliance had been expected to continue despite last month's decision not to cooperate in the local elections.
The local elections themselves will have little impact on the balance of power in Turkey generally.

Under the presidential system ushered in by the June elections, Erdogan already wields extensive power. However his AK Party requires the support of MHP lawmakers to achieve a majority and push through legislation in parliament.

LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistan on Saturday detained scores of protesters in a continuing crackdown against followers of a hardline Islamic cleric who led three days of protests over blasphemy laws and whose arrest overnight triggered violent clashes with police.
Members of cleric Khadim Hussain Rizvi's Tehreek-e-Labbaik (TLP) party had shut down major cities in protest earlier this month at the acquittal of a Christian woman who had spent eight years on death row on blasphemy charges. 
At least five people were wounded in last night's clashes between Rizvi's supporters and police in the eastern city of Lahore after police arrested the cleric on Friday night. 
A spokesman for the Punjab chief minister's office said Rizvi's second-in-command, Afzal Qadri, had also been detained. 
""Afzal Qadri and Khadim Rizvi have been sent to jail. Qadri has been admitted to the jail's hospital. A crackdown is underway across Punjab against TLP activists,"" Shahbaz Gill told Reuters. 
Information Minister Fawwad Chaudhry said on Twitter that Rizvi had been placed in protective custody after he refused to withdraw a call for further protests on Sunday.
""It's to safeguard public life, property and order,"" he said. 
Rizvi had urged his supporters to take to the streets if he was arrested. Late on Friday his son said he had been taken away in a raid on his religious school, or madrassa, in Lahore.
A police document seen by Reuters listed 10 other leaders of Rizvi's group who had also been detained. 
TLP leaders had threatened the Supreme Court judges who acquitted Asia Bibi - urging their cooks and servants to kill them.
But the group called off protests following negotiations with the government and an agreement to open a review of the court's decision on Bibi.
It is unclear whether Rizvi will appear before a court to face charges. Pakistan has detained Islamist leaders in the past but failed to keep them in custody. 
Bibi and her family are in hiding after her release. She was convicted in 2010 for allegedly making derogatory remarks about Islam after neighbors objected to her drinking water from their glass because she was not Muslim. She has always denied committing blasphemy.

In 2011, a bodyguard assassinated Punjab provincial governor Salman Taseer after he began pushing for Bibi's acquittal. The TLP was founded out of a movement that supported the assassin, Mumtaz Qadri.

Washington in May reimposed sanctions on Tehran, after President Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran under which they had been lifted.
""Submitting to the West headed by America would be treason against our religion ... and against the future generations of this region,"" Rouhani told an international conference on Islamic unity in Tehran, in a speech broadcast live on state television.
""We have a choice to either roll out red carpets for criminals, or to forcefully stand against injustice and remain faithful to our Prophet, our Koran and our Islam,"" Rouhani said, in an apparent reference to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states which have close ties to Washington.
Iran and Saudi Arabia are regional rivals and have supported opposing sides in conflicts in Syria and Yemen and different political factions in Iraq and Lebanon.

""We are ready to defend the interests of the Saudi people against terrorism, aggression and the superpowers... and we don't ask for $450 billion to do it,"" Rouhani said, referring to Saudi Arabia's contracts with the United States.

641,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2018 02:46AM ET</span>",Bahrain holds elections with ban on opposition groups,"By Aziz El Yaakoubi and Nafisa Eltahir
DUBAI (Reuters) - Bahrainis vote on Saturday in a parliamentary election from which opposition groups have been barred, in a crackdown on dissent in the small Sunni-led, Western-allied kingdom.
Activists have called for a boycott of the vote, which they say is a ""farce"". The government says the election is democratic.
The Sunni ruling Al Khalifa family has kept a lid on dissent since the Shi'ite opposition staged a failed uprising in 2011. Saudi Arabia sent in troops to help crush that unrest in a mark of concern that any power-sharing concession by Bahrain could inspire Saudi Arabia's own Shi'ite minority.
Riyadh regards the neighboring island nation, which does not possess vast oil wealth like other Gulf states, as a critical ally in its proxy wars with Iran in the Middle East.
Bahrain, which is home to the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, has closed the main opposition groups, barred their members from running in elections and prosecuted scores of people, many described by human rights groups as activists, in mass trials.
""Clearly, legislatures from the world's leading democratic states believe that the upcoming election in Bahrain lacks legitimacy. You simply cannot crush, torture and imprison your entire opposition, call for a pseudo-election, and then demand the respect of the international community,"" said Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, director of the UK-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD).
The government said 506 candidates are running in the election, including 137 running for local city councils and the highest number of female candidates. It expects a higher voter turnout than in 2014, which it put at 53 percent, when opposition groups boycotted the elections.
Bahrain's state news agency (BNA) said voting began at 8 a.m (0500 GMT) and Bahrainis have until 8 p.m. (1700 GMT) to vote. Around 365,000 are expected in 54 polling stations, it added.
Only 23, out of 40 incumbents of the House of Representatives, are seeking re-election this year to parliament, which has limited powers.
The kingdom's interior ministry called on Bahrainis to disregard rumors and seek ""trusted sources"" for information. ""Text messages saying your name has been removed and calling on you not to vote are false,"" the ministry said in a Twitter post.
Many of Bahrain's Shi'ites say they are deprived of jobs and government services and treated as second class citizens in the country of 1.5 million.
The authorities deny the allegations and accuse Iran of fostering unrest that has seen demonstrators clash with security forces, who have been targeted by several bomb attacks. Tehran denies the allegations.
BAHRAIN EMBOLDENED
Human Rights Watch said in a statement that Manama is failing to create conditions necessary for a free election by ""jailing or silencing people who challenge the ruling family"" and banning all opposition parties.
A leader of dissolved opposition group al-Wefaq said the rise of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has emboldened Bahrain's authorities in their crackdown, which has included stripping scores of activists of their nationality.
""They couldn't go ahead with all the crackdown without the strong backing of the Saudi government. Mohammed bin Salman listens only to hardliners in Bahrain's ruling family,"" Ali Alaswad, who lives in self-exile in London and has been sentenced in absentia to life in prison, told Reuters.
Government opponents say the space for political expression has been shrinking in the lead up to the election. Several activists, including a former lawmaker, were arrested last week for tweeting about boycotting elections, activists said.
""No-one is barred from expressing their political views,"" said a government spokeswomen. ""Bahrain is home to 16 political societies, the majority of which have put forward candidates for the upcoming elections, and the government fully supports open and inclusive political dialogue.” 
Some candidates have taken to social media to urge Bahrainis to vote as a patriotic duty.
""Those who don't participate will not be part of the national consensus or equation in Bahrain,"" said Ali Al Aradi, deputy president of Bahrain's House of Representatives. 
Some opposition figures hope the outcry over the murder of prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Riyadh's consulate in Istanbul last month could help strengthen more moderate voices in the region, including members of Bahrain's royal family who are open to dialogue with the opposition.
The killing of Khashoggi, a critic of Prince Mohammed, has drawn global condemnation and exposed Saudi Arabia's crackdown on dissent and aggressive foreign policy.
""Now if there's a real accusation from the U.S. against Mohammed bin Salman, radical wings in Bahrain which don't want to work with the opposition will be weakened,"" Alaswad said.
But some analysts are skeptical. 
""The killing of Khashoggi will simply serve to highlight that those wishing to highlight abuses face a much riskier task,"" said Marc Owen Jones of the Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies, University of Exeter. 
""If anything it will have a chilling effect.""

AYODHYA, India (Reuters) - Indian authorities will launch a major security operation at the ruins of 16th-century mosque in Ayodhya on Sunday when tens of thousands of Hindu monks and religious leaders gather to urge the government to build a new Hindu temple on the disputed site.
A militant Hindu mob demolished the centuries-old mosque in 1992, triggering communal riots that killed about 2,000 people across India.
As millions of Hindus believe that the mosque stood at the birthplace of Lord Ram, one of their most revered deities, the dispute continues to be at the core of tensions between Hindus and India's Muslim minority. 
Hindu groups insist that there was a temple at the site before the mosque was built in 1528.
""More than 200,000 people will attend,"" said Surendra Jain, All India Joint General Secretary of the Vishva Hindu Parishad, a Hindu nationalist organization, which is holding a 'dharma sabha' or religious congregation in Ayodhya.
""We assure everyone, though we don't need to, that not even a twig will be disturbed.""
Ahead of a general election that must be held by May next year, leaders from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its associates have become more vocal in their demand the government introduce legislation paving the way for a new Hindu temple on the site.
Authorities hope Sunday's religious gathering does not further inflame tensions between Hindus and Muslims.
""The government will ensure that the event passes off peacefully and the local administration has put in place an elaborate security apparatus,"" Anil Pathak, district chief of Faizabad, where the Ayodhya town is located, told Reuters. ""No one will be allowed to disturb peace and order in the city.""
""We want to assure that the administration is geared up to maintain peace and protect people and properties in Ayodhya and Faizabad,"" Pathak said. 
Ayodhya is in the politically important northern Uttar Pradesh state, which is bigger than Brazil by population, and sends more lawmakers than any other state to India's parliament. 
Uttar Pradesh is ruled by BJP's Yogi Adityanath, a Hindu hardliner who has been accused of inciting violence against the country's Muslim minority, who make up 14 percent of India's 1.3 billion people.
More than 900 extra police and a large number of military, including elite commandos, will be deployed at Sunday's event, said Vivek Tripathi, spokesman for the Uttar Pradesh police.
Tripathi said drone cameras would also monitor the event.
Zafaryab Jilani, a senior member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, said Muslims do not want a confrontation but the state administration must ensure the safety of the community.

""Although the administration is vigilant, the planned meeting does bring back memories of 1992 when violence broke out after the demolition of the mosque,"" said Haji Mahboob Ahmad, a 65-year-old Muslim community leader.

Security Council for a joint survey of inter-Korean railways, the first step towards reconnecting rail and road links cut during the 1950-53 Korean War.
In April, the leaders of the two Koreas agreed to adopt practical steps to reconnect railways and roads as part of efforts to improve bilateral relationships. 
""The sanctions exemption has big implications given that the project has garnered recognition and support from the United States and the international society,"" South Korea's presidential spokesperson Kim Eui-kyeom said. 
He expressed hope of quick construction of the railways, which he said will take inter-Korean cooperation to a new level.
South Korea requested an exemption for deliveries of fuel and other equipment needed to conduct the railway survey in the North, Yonhap News Agency said. 
Pyongyang is under wide-ranging U.N. sanctions for its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. 
In October, the two Koreas agreed to carry out joint field studies on transport plans, with a ground-breaking ceremony in late November and early December. 
But the plan was delayed amid stalled talks between Washington and Pyongyang following an unprecedented summit in June at which the two sides agreed to work toward nuclearization and peace on the Korean peninsula.
Negotiations have since made little headway, with Pyongyang upset by Washington’s insistence that international sanctions must remain until it gives up its nuclear weapons.
The United States has told its ally South Korea it should not improve ties with North Korea faster than Pyongyang takes steps to give up its nuclear weapons..

TIJUANA, Mexico (Reuters) - Unaccompanied minors and other vulnerable migrants risk falling victim to crime in the Mexican border city of Tijuana, where thousands of Central Americans from caravans may be stuck for months as authorities tighten up asylum rules, advocates say.
Some 4,600 migrants from the bedraggled caravans whose advance has angered U.S. President Donald Trump are camped out with blankets and little food in an overcrowded stadium in Tijuana, whose mayor has declared a ""humanitarian crisis.""
Trump has sent troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, authorized the use of lethal force and threatened to shut down the frontier entirely if the migrant caravans are not stopped.
Among the Central Americans, many of whom are Hondurans fleeing violence and poverty in the struggling region, are about 80 minors between the ages of 10 and 17, according to migrants rights groups.
Josue, a 15-year-old Honduran in Tijuana, said that during a previous attempt to cross into the United States last year he was kidnapped and badly beaten in Mexico by drug traffickers claiming to be from the notorious Zetas gang.
""I ended up in the hospital, I don't know how, because I arrived there half-dead,"" he said, declining to give his second name.
Once he was well enough, authorities deported him, he said.
Reuters was not able to independently corroborate details of his story. Mexico's immigration institute did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the case. 
Tijuana was rated by Mexican think tank Seguridad Justicia y Paz as the fifth most violent city in the world in 2017, with a higher murder rate than the Central American cities from which the migrants are escaping. 
Juan Manuel Gastelum, Tijuana's mayor, said late on Thursday that the city was facing a humanitarian crisis and that supporting the migrants was costing more than 500,000 pesos ($25,000) a day. He urged international agencies to help Tijuana.
WAITING LIST
Activists fear the Central Americans could be stranded for a long time in the city, where some protests against the presence of the caravan have broken out.
In May, citing a lack of processing space at the same crossing, U.S. immigration officials stalled a previous caravan that also drew Trump's anger. Eventually, they began letting in a trickle of people from the group.
To manage flows of asylum claimants, Mexican and U.S. authorities have in recent years maintained a waiting list. Lawyers and human rights group Amnesty International have said such measures slow the process.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement sent to Reuters that the San Ysidro Port of Entry, which connects Tijuana to San Diego in California, could process up to 100 people per day and that it was working with Mexico to manage the flow. 
Mexico's National Immigration Institute said it protects the rights of all foreigners and was ""respectful of immigration policy implemented by other countries."" 
Stalled for days, migrants from the caravan have been signing onto the waiting list. They include gay and transgender teenagers.
Erika Pinheiro, director of litigation at Al Otro Lado, an immigration legal advocacy group, last week told a Californian court under oath that ""LGBT children cannot safely stay in Mexico. They are at risk of violence and persecution.""
Tijuana has just one shelter for migrant children, which subsists with the help of civic organizations.
""Young people are definitely the most vulnerable in this type of movement,"" said Mynor Contreras, who runs the local YMCA. ""We've never received so many in such a short time.""
If the children cannot enter the United States, they risk being deported from Mexico. That can spell big trouble.

""I don't want to die,"" said 16-year-old Justin, who related how his life was threatened last month for not paying a ""war tax"" that gangsters charged for his small used-clothing business in the Honduran city of San Pedro Sula. ""That day I told my mother to give me her blessing and I left,"" he said, crying.

Sydney Airport canceled 76 flights after all but one runway was closed.
Weather bureau meteorologist Rosemary Barr told Reuters the winds gradually eased on Saturday to up to 30 kph after a low-pressure system in the Tasman sea weakened and moved east.
The winds had been part of a massive weather system over southeast Australia, that whipped up a 500 km (310 miles) dust storm on Thursday, which swept across the drought-parched interior to blanket Sydney.
Sydney Airport spokeswoman Cait Tynan said the airport was operating normally on Saturday with both runways operational.
Virgin and Qantas airlines put on additional flights to clear the backlog of travelers stranded by the weather.
Jetstar Airways said it had seven cancellations early on Saturday morning but was back on schedule by noon.
The easing winds also brought relief on Saturday after 21 fires were fanned by the strong gusts across New South Wales state on Friday.
A modified Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 capable of carrying 15,000 liters (3,960 gallons) of water or fire retardant helped to fight fires around the city of Newcastle, north of Sydney, on Friday.

More than 100 firefighters prepared containment lines in the area overnight, the Rural Fire Service said.

The so-called Camp Fire virtually obliterated the city of Paradise, located 175 miles (280 km) northeast of San Francisco, on Nov. 8, killing at least 84 people and destroying nearly 14,000 homes. 
Over 600 people from Paradise and surrounding communities remained unaccounted for, according to a list provided by the Butte County Sheriff's Office. Drone footage https://buttecountyrecovers.org/Maps provided by the town of Paradise to help residents see if their homes survived showed how fire leapt from house to house in the mountain community of 27,000. 
Darrel Wilken, 51, a nurse at the town's partially destroyed hospital, said emergency workers told him they were having difficulty collecting human remains after 3 inches of rain turned the ash of burned home sites into slurry. 
""The remains, some of them are just going to wash away, because they are just ash,"" said Wilken, who fled the blaze with three patients in his car. ""It's grim to think of, but they may never find a large portion of the people missing.""
A further 1 to 3 inches (2.5-7.5 cm) of rain is expected to fall between Friday and Sunday, the National Weather Service (NWS) said. 
""Flash floods and debris flows will be a particular threat in the wildfire burn areas,"" the NWS said in a notice warning of the risk of flash floods through late Friday afternoon.
Paradise was a popular destination for retirees, and two-thirds of the victims named so far were aged over 65.
Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea has warned that remains of victims may be ""very small bone fragments,"" and some may never be found.
Firefighting teams had contained 95 percent of the blaze, which torched 154,000 acres - an area five times the size of San Francisco, said Andrew Freeborn, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
""The precipitation is a positive,"" said Freeborn, adding that specialists were monitoring for flash floods or mudslides that could endanger firefighters.
Thousands of people forced to flee Paradise spent Thanksgiving in warehouses in the nearby city of Chico, or with friends or relatives in nearby towns. 
Wilken visited his children for the first time since he called them the day of the fire and told them he thought he was going to die. He credits his survival to sweeping burning pine needles off the hood of his car as other vehicles caught fire.

""I'm emotionally traumatized by what happened,"" said Wilken, who keeps in close contact with co-workers, some of whom lost family, to help work on his grief.

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - The brother of Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez was arrested on Friday in the United States on drug trafficking charges, the Honduran government said on Friday. 
Juan Antonio ""Tony"" Hernandez, a 40-year-old lawyer and former ruling party lawmaker, was arrested by U.S. authorities in Miami, the president's office said in a statement.
The president's brother is the latest in a string of prominent Hondurans, including three congressmen, who have been charged in the United States for involvement with drug trafficking.
""This is a heavy blow for the whole family,"" the president told reporters in his hometown of Gracias, in western Honduras. ""I hope the justice system gives him the room to defend himself, and as a family, we will do what we can to support him.""
Reuters could not immediately contact a lawyer for the president's brother. He has denied previous accusations of links to the Cachiros drug trafficking organization.
A leader of the Cachiros gang had testified during a trial in March 2017 in New York that ""Tony"" Hernandez had taken a bribe to help launder drug funds.
The Honduran president, a conservative lawyer who came to power in 2014, has reined in homicides with a tough policy against drug cartels and street gangs that has been supported by the United States and criticized by human rights groups.
Former President Porfirio Lobo, who governed Honduras between 2010 and 2014, has also been linked to the Cachiros criminal organization in trials in the United States and has rejected these accusations.
Last year, one of Lobo's sons pleaded guilty before a U.S. court to conspiring to import cocaine into the United States and was sentenced to 24 years in prison.

PARIS (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of people will rally in Paris on Saturday against rising fuel costs and President Emmanuel Macron's economic policies, the second weekend of ""yellow vest"" protests that have led to widespread national disruption.
Security forces are concerned that far-left and far-right extremists may infiltrate the demonstrations, escalating the crowd-control challenges. Around 30,000 people are expected to protest in Paris alone, Denis Jacob, secretary general of police union Alternative Police, told Reuters.
""We know there are ultra-right and ultra-left infiltrators. You can also expect gangs from the suburbs and 'black-blocks',"" he said, referring to a militant protest force.
Some 3,000 police officers have been drafted in to work in Paris on Saturday, city hall said, with security forces having to handle a demonstration against sexual violence, a soccer match and a rugby game in the capital on the same day.
For more than a week, protesters clad in the fluorescent yellow jackets that all motorists in France must have in their cars have blocked highways across the country with burning barricades and convoys of slow-moving trucks, obstructing access to fuel depots, shopping centers and some factories.
They are opposed to taxes Macron introduced last year on diesel and petrol to encourage people to shift to more environmentally friendly transport. Alongside the tax, the government has offered incentives to buy green or electric vehicles.
Last Saturday, when nearly 300,000 people took part in the first yellow vest demonstrations countrywide, retailers' daily revenue fell 35 percent, according to consumer groups. 
The unrest is a dilemma for Macron who casts himself as a champion against climate change but has been derided as out of touch with common folk and is fighting a slump in popularity.
In Paris, authorities have permitted a gathering next to the Eiffel Tower on Saturday but rejected requests for a protest on the Place de la Concorde, which is close to the National Assembly and the presidential Elysee Palace. The tower itself will be closed to the public.
Despite calls for calm from the government, the yellow vest protests have spread to French territories abroad, including the Indian Ocean island of Reunion, where cars were set on fire.
The unrest has left two dead and 606 injured in mainland France, the Interior Ministry said on Thursday.
While the movement, which has no leader, began as a backlash against higher fuel prices, it has tapped into broader frustration at the sense of a squeeze on household spending power under Macron's 18-month-old government.
French retailers warned on Friday that the protests across the country could derail the crucial Christmas shopping season that started with Black Friday discounts. [nL8N1XY0XH]
Despite the disruptions, an Elabe poll for BFM TV showed 70 percent of French still approve of the yellow vest movement.
Since coming to power, Macron has seen off trade union and street demonstrations against his changes to the labor rules, and overhauled the heavily indebted state rail operator. Foreign investors have largely cheered his pro-business administration.

But political foes have dismissed him as the ""president of the rich"" for ending a wealth tax, and voters appear to be growing restless, with the 40-year-old president's popularity slumped at barely 20 percent.

651,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2018 05:55PM ET</span>","Ahead of Nigeria's election, opposition weaponizes soldier deaths","By Paul Carsten
LAGOS (Reuters) - Hundreds of Nigerian soldiers have been killed in recent months by Islamist militants who the president vowed to defeat when voted into power in 2015 - and the bloodshed has become a useful weapon for opponents aiming to topple him in coming elections.
Muhammadu Buhari's administration has been largely silent about the fighting in the northeast as, in battle after battle, soldiers have died.
On Thursday Buhari's political opponents disclosed that 44 soldiers had been killed in an attack in the village of Metele, in the northeastern state of Borno, on Sunday. 
The move is calculated to undermine the security credentials of the president as he seeks a second term in three months' time, say politics and security analysts.
Buhari is a former military general and commander-in-chief who came to power promising to defeat the insurgents and whose administration has claimed for years to have beaten Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa (ISWA). 
The candidate for the opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP) is Atiku Abubakar, a businessman and former vice president seeking to topple Buhari.
The Senate president, Bukola Saraki, is also PDP and tightly controls the upper house of parliament, which suspended its session on Thursday to honor the fallen after announcing the deaths.
The PDP ""are playing politics with conflict,"" said Idayat Hassan, director of the Abuja-based Center for Democracy and Development.
""They know elections can be won or lost based on the issue of security,"" she said. ""Many people will be very angry. The government has made no statement, they have not confirmed it, so it will be taken as another attempt to deny that the Boko Haram insurgency has not been completely defeated.""
A PDP spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A Nigerian presidency spokesman said the military would issue a statement. In a statement posted late on Friday on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, the army confirmed that troops were attacked in Metele on Sunday.
""Several social media, print and online publications have been brandishing false casualty figures,"" it said in the statement, without disclosing the number of those killed or injured.
""FAILING STRATEGY""
Attacks by Boko Haram in the run-up to the last election in 2015 weakened then-president Goodluck Jonathan and helped Buhari to defeat him at the polls.
The course of the conflict now appears to be turning in favor of Islamist militants fighting fatigued, ill-equipped troops.
The attack in Metele was carried out by ISWA and killed around 100 Nigerian soldiers, four security sources told Reuters on Thursday.
Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, and others in northeast Nigeria in recent days. 
""This is a legitimate campaign issue,"" said Matthew Page, an associate fellow with Chatham House's Africa Program.
""The military strategy in the northeast has been failing,"" he said. ""This type of failure to exert control over the national territory isn't sustainable in the long run. It reflects really poorly on the incumbent president with the man on the street.""
In the past, news of heavy military defeats has trickled out from anonymous sources and was only carried by a minority of domestic media. With the Senate's and Abubakar's public announcement, details of the Sunday attack have been made widely known.
""It's been hugely carried by the media today, and that is definitely helping the opposition,"" said Kabir Adamu, managing director of intelligence and security risk management firm Beacon Consulting.

""We haven't seen a statement from the Nigerian government.""

QUITO (Reuters) - Ecuador needs some $550 million to provide aid to Venezuelan citizens fleeing their country's economic crisis, and hopes to raise the funds through donations from multilateral agencies and nearby countries, an Ecuadorean official said the Friday.
    Delegations from a dozen Latin American countries met in Quito on Thursday and Friday to coordinate plans to deal with the Venezuelan migration crisis, which is overwhelming social services agencies throughout South America.
    ""We have quantified Ecuador's medium- and long-term needs at around $550 million,"" Santiago Chavez, deputy minister of human mobility, told reporters. ""This has to do with health, education, housing and employment needs."" 
Ecuador estimates that some 600,000 Venezuelan citizens have entered the country in 2018 via the Colombian border, most of whom continue on toward Peru.
Ecuador is seeking to guarantee the migrants' human rights and ensure an orderly transition to their new surroundings, Chavez added.
Ecuador's government also hopes to obtain resources from regional multilateral organizations and may seek to create a fund financed by countries in the region, he said, adding that it has arranged a meeting in Quito on Nov. 30 that is to include the United States, Canada, Japan, Qatar and the European Union.
    The United Nations says around 3 million people have left Venezuela since 2015, fleeing the hyperinflationary collapse that has left millions unable to obtain basic food or medicine.

BRUSSELS/HAVANA (Reuters) - Spanish reservations over Gibraltar on Friday prevented the European Union clearing the last hurdle before the bloc signs off its Brexit deal with Britain, with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez saying a summit on Sunday could be called off.
With four months left until Britain leaves the EU, the divorce treaty and an accompanying political declaration are due to be rubber-stamped in Brussels by British Prime Minister Theresa May and the other 27 EU leaders.
But Sanchez said on Friday evening he had yet to receive assurances that any future decisions on Gibraltar, a British overseas territory on Spain's coast that Spain claims as its own, would be decided in direct talks with Madrid.
""The guarantees are still not enough and Spain maintains its veto to Brexit. If there is a deal, then it will be lifted,"" he said during a trip to Cuba. ""If there is no deal ... the European Council will most likely not take place.""
Spanish, British and Commission negotiators were still looking for a deal on Friday evening.
May will pick up the baton on Saturday evening when she meets in Brussels with Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the EU's executive Commission, and European Council President Donald Tusk, who will chair the summit. 
Spain has asked for changes to both the draft withdrawal treaty and the accompanying declaration on future ties.
At Sunday's summit, the EU leaders would expect to endorse the treaty and approve the declaration by consensus, which means Spain in effect has the power to hold up the process.
May's spokeswoman said London would work with the Spanish government on Gibraltar.
PRESSURE
In Germany, a government spokesman was confident a solution would be found in time for Sunday's summit.
Berlin had earlier said there could be no more technical negotiations at the summit, and that Chancellor Angela Merkel could skip it if all the texts are not ready in advance. 
If everything goes to plan and the Brexit package is approved on Sunday, the EU will also promise to try to secure prompt ratification by the European Parliament ""to provide for an orderly withdrawal"", according to a draft statement seen by Reuters.
However, the biggest obstacle to the Brexit accord is the vehement opposition in the British parliament. Without its approval, Britain could leave the bloc on March 29 without an agreement to mitigate economic and legal disruption.
Former Brexit minister Dominic Raab on Friday said he expected the House of Commons to vote the deal down.
Arlene Foster, the leader of the small Northern Irish DUP, which props up May's minority government, said it would not support the deal as it stands. 
May said that Britain would not get a better deal with the EU if it did not take this one.
THE ROCK AND FISHERIES
Determined not to allow any redrafting to risk derailing the fragile process, EU states want to address Spain's concerns in a separate statement by the 27 leaders on Sunday that would not be part of negotiations with Britain. 
It could refer back to the EU's 2017 Brexit mandate, which said that, after Brexit, ""no agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom may apply to the territory of Gibraltar without the agreement between ... Spain and the United Kingdom"".
It would clarify that the EU's reading of the corresponding paragraphs in the divorce treaty and the declaration on future ties is exactly that. 
Other clauses in this separate statement say, according to a draft seen by Reuters, that the bloc would want to get a new deal on fisheries with Britain as a priority in talks on the broader trade relationship, to be agreed ""well before"" the end of Britain's status-quo transition period after Brexit.
It adds that any such deal would build on the existing access of EU vessels to Britain's rich fishing waters, something London wants to be firmly in control of. 
It further highlights EU demands that Britain does not undercut labor, environmental or labor standards. It stresses the needs to safeguard expatriates' rights, as well as the Paris climate accord.
EU diplomats hoped a text would be agreed late on Friday, but feared Sanchez would still want to discuss it at the top level on Sunday to demonstrate his determination at home ahead of a December regional election. 
""It will only be done by the leaders,"" said one diplomat.

The Brexit deal covers financial settlement, citizens' rights and the Irish border, as well as setting a blueprint for future trade and security ties.

The town - which was a resting point for tourists going on Sahara camping tours before Libya plunged into chaos in 2011 - listed six residents on its website as having been killed.

Koufa, a radical preacher, inspired the Massina Liberation Front (MLF), a group blamed for a wave of attacks that has shifted Mali’s six-year-old Islamist insurgency from the remote desert north ever closer to its populous south.

(Reuters) - A U.S. judge has dismissed nationwide litigation over the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 in which victims' families sought to hold the carrier, its insurer Allianz (DE:ALVG) SE and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co liable for the still-unexplained disaster.
U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson in Washington ruled on Wednesday night that the wrongful death and product liability litigation, encompassing 40 lawsuits, did not belong in the United States.
She said the case belonged in Malaysia, which has an ""overwhelming interest"" in and ""substantial nexus"" to the March 8, 2014 disappearance of Flight MH370, a Boeing 777 heading to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur with 239 people on board.
""At its core, this case is about the unexplained disappearance of a passenger plane operated by Malaysia Airlines as part of its national air carrier fleet following its departure from a Malaysian airport,"" Jackson wrote.
""Litigation in the United States related to the Flight MH370 disaster is inconvenient,"" she added.
The 61-page decision is a setback for plaintiffs from the United States, Australia, China, India and Malaysia who represented more than 100 Flight MH370 passengers, including from Japan.
The plane is believed to have crashed in the south Indian Ocean after veering far off course, but no remains or large pieces of wreckage have been found.
Flight MH370's disappearance remains one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries.
A 495-page report from Malaysian investigators in July offered no clear answers about what happened.
The plaintiffs sued under the Montreal Convention, an international treaty governing air transportation incidents, and various U.S. state laws.
Mary Schiavo, a lawyer for some of the plaintiffs, said in an email on Friday her clients were preparing for a June 2019 trial in Kuala Lumpur over the plane.
Malaysia Airlines, Boeing, their respective lawyers, and lawyers for other plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The carrier was insured by Allianz's Global Corporate & Specialty SE unit, according to Wednesday's decision. Hugo Kidston, a spokesman for the unit, declined to comment.

HAMILTON, Bermuda (Reuters) - Bermuda's top court ruled on Friday that legislation banning same-sex marriage was unconstitutional, rejecting a government bid to overturn an earlier court ruling that reached the same conclusion.
""In the judgment about to be handed down, we dismissed the appeal of the attorney general,"" Sir Scott Baker, president of the Bermuda Court of Appeal, told the crowded courtroom, sparking whoops of applause from gay rights supporters.
Baker was referring to an appeal lodged by the government against a June ruling by Bermuda's Supreme Court striking down the gay marriage ban passed by Bermudian lawmakers last year. The ban was later approved by the British governor.
The ruling may still be brought before the judicial committee of the Privy Council in London - the final court of appeal for British overseas territories like Bermuda.
In the meantime, same-sex marriages will be allowed to resume after a pause of several months following the enactment of Bermuda's Domestic Partnership Act, which reversed gay marriage rights in favor of domestic partnerships.
The government has 21 days to appeal the decision.

MADRID (Reuters) - Migrants from Central America are turning to former colonial master Spain as they face rejection from the United States in their attempts to escape rampant violence and poverty at home, but the streets of Madrid offer little relief.
After selling all they have to pay for flights to Europe, the migrants often end up sleeping on the streets or in doorways, without warm clothes, food or cash.
""Our baby is just two months old and we've run out of money ... we don’t have anywhere to stay right now,"" said 40-year-old Salvadoran Nelson Delgado as he queued for the third day and night with his wife and baby outside the only migrant center in Madrid.
""It's OK if I don't get any benefits, just something for them to have a better future,"" he said, choking on tears. 
The number of asylum-seekers from Central America and Venezuela has grown notably in the past month after U.S. President Donald Trump denounced U.S.-bound migrant caravans as an ""invasion"" and sent troops to the border with Mexico to stop them.
But their hopes of better treatment are falling flat in Spain, which along with other European countries is already overwhelmed by a wave of migrants from north Africa and the Middle East.
Finally getting to the front of the winding migration center line only allows the migrants to book an appointment to begin the asylum process. The luckier ones get a slot in 2019, the less fortunate in 2020. 
The interior ministry said it was ""aware of the scale of drama"" and was working to resolve the situation. The number of asylum seekers in Spain has soared 12-fold since 2010.
This year alone, almost 45,000 asylum seekers had entered the country by the end of October, according to Interior Ministry data, with the highest numbers from Venezuela, Colombia, Syria and Honduras. More than 63,000 asylum requests have yet to be resolved. 
Delgado, a former bus driver, says he and his wife fled their home town of Ahuchapan on the border with Guatemala after he was briefly kidnapped and then faced threats by a criminal gang in another town where they tried to settle. 
They decided to emigrate together with another family.
""There was a migrant caravan to the United States ... but we didn't (join in). We were afraid they could deport us back to El Salvador or even separate us from our baby boy,"" said Delgado.
A parish church ended up accepting Delgado and his kin. It is already providing shelter to five other families from central America. Among them is Jonathan Martinez of Venezuela and his three children who had to sleep in a doorway after a social services center kicked them out when it had no space.

The local priest, Javier Baeza, blamed the government for barring access to humanitarian programs for migrants. ""These people need to be helped, it's a human right,"" he said.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Congolese presidential candidates Felix Tshisekedi and Vital Kamerhe joined forces on Friday to take on the preferred successor of incumbent Joseph Kabila in the Dec. 23 election.
Tshisekedi, 55, the president of Congo's largest opposition party, the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS), said he would select Kamerhe as his prime minister if he wins the vote. In return, he would back a candidate from Kamerhe's Union for the Congolese Nation (UNC) party in the 2023 presidential election.
""I decide today to support Mr. Tshisekedi as the president of Congo,"" Kamerhe said at a joint news conference with Tshisekedi in Nairobi to cheers from supporters. ""This is the winning ticket.""
Tshisekedi and Kamerhe, 59, had agreed on Nov. 11 to support businessman Martin Fayulu in the election against former interior minister Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, who is backed by Kabila.
It was a rare moment of unity for Democratic Republic of Congo's splintered opposition, whose infighting in recent years has often played into the hands of Kabila.
However, Tshisekedi and Kamerhe withdrew from the deal the next day after scores of Congolese opposition supporters demonstrated in the capital Kinshasa against the choice of former  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) manager Fayulu.
Other opposition leaders, including two whose presidential candidacies were rejected by the constitutional court, continue to back Fayulu, weakening their chances of beating Shadary. 
An opinion poll in October showed opposition leaders were favoured by about 70 percent of voters but Fayulu trailed his rivals on eight percent. 
Tshisekedi led with 36 percent ahead of Kamerhe (17 percent) and Shadary (16 percent).
PEACE AND SECURITY 
Western governments and investors regard the election, which could lead to the Central African country's first ever democratic transfer of power, as crucial toward ending political instability that is impeding investment in Congo. The country of 80 million people is rich in natural resources but mired in humanitarian crises.
""One of our main priorities will be to restore peace and security, mostly to the eastern part of the country,"" Tshisekedi said at the news conference. 
Kabila has ruled since his father was assassinated in 2001 with elections meant to have happened before his mandate expired in 2016.
The delays have left many doubting it would ever take place. Questions remain over how it will be conducted.
Congo's influential conference of Catholic bishops warned this week that an Ebola epidemic and clashes with rebel militia in eastern Congo could threaten the validity of the vote.
""We must do everything to avoid a parody of an election whose results would not be accepted and which would, moreover, plunge our country into violence,"" the National Episcopal Conference of Congo (CENCO) said in a statement.
Presidential elections in 2006 and 2011 were marred by accusations of fraud and violence after the results were announced. 
CENCO also questioned the use of a new electronic voting system, which the opposition says is more vulnerable to vote-rigging than paper and ink and could be compromised by the unreliability of Congo's power supply. 

To ensure the electoral results stand up to scrutiny, the electoral commission must make sure ballots are counted manually after they are printed by the machines, CENCO said.

Many rich Angolans live or own property in Portugal, its former colonial master, and President Joao Lourenco has approved a law to confiscate any ""unexplained assets"" held by Angolans abroad from January 2019.
""We will give all collaboration to Angolan authorities to help in the fight on corruption ... and to recover capital which is wrongly obtained,"" Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa told reporters during a Lourenco's visit to Lisbon.
""What is important here is to give back what is rightfully theirs,"" he added.
Lourenco's drive is aimed at alleged corruption by elite groups surrounding his predecessor, Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who ruled Angola for 38 years. 
A year ago, Lourenco sacked Isabel dos Santos, the former president's daughter and Africa's richest woman, from her position as head of Angolan state oil company Sonangol.
Her brother, Jose Filomeno dos Santos, who headed Angola's sovereign wealth fund, is under arrest and faces charges of money laundering at home. One charge alleges that he transferred $500 million abroad. Filomeno dos Santos has denied the charges.
Isabel dos Santos has various investments in Portugal, including in oil company Galp, telecoms firm NOS and Banco BIC Portugues.

The first of thousands of Cuban doctors left Brazil on Thursday after criticism by incoming President Jair Bolsonaro prompted Cuba's government to sever a cooperation agreement, leaving millions of Brazilians without medical care. 
In a press release issued on Friday, the health ministry said it had managed in three days to procure 19,994 Brazilian doctors to take the Cubans' places, often in poor, rural areas.
""Of that total, 13,341 were enlisted, and 7,154 professionals have already been allocated to municipalities to start immediately,"" the statement said. 
The health ministry said that a web portal to handle inscriptions, open until Dec. 7, had suffered cyber attacks, which had caused some problems, but the site was now stable.
Bolsonaro has said the Cuban doctors were being used as ""slave labor"" because Havana took 75 percent of their salaries. He said the program, which began in 2013, could continue only if they got full pay and were allowed to bring their families.
Bolsonaro, an admirer of U.S. President Donald Trump, was elected last month by Brazilians fed up with rising crime and rampant corruption that reached new highs during almost a decade-and-a-half of leftist governments with close ties to Cuba.

Cuba has a respected health service and generates major export earnings by sending more than 50,000 health workers to over 60 countries. Even though they received only a fraction of their salaries, the money was good for the doctors by Cuban standards.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's ruling nationalists were likely to survive a no-confidence vote in parliament launched on Friday, but have seen their grip on power loosened by allegations of extortion at the financial regulator.
The biggest opposition party, the centrist Civic Platform (PO), filed the no-confidence motion on Friday, accusing the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) of failing to ensure an independent inquiry into corruption allegations.
On Friday, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki appointed the deputy head of the legal department at state-owned Pekao bank, Jacek Jastrzebski, to head Poland's KNF financial regulator.
He replaces Marek Chrzanowski, a PiS appointee who resigned last week after the billionaire owner of a bank accused him of demanding payments of millions of dollars to a lawyer for ""support"".
Chrzanowski denies wrongdoing. The accusation of corruption at the regulator caused a fall in share prices of Polish banks.
Although PiS has more than enough votes in parliament to survive a confidence vote, the motion comes at a time when its popularity ratings have fallen.
The party faces a general election in a year, and is weathering strong criticism from its political opponents at home, from the European Union and from Poland's judges.
Along with Hungary's ruling Fidesz party, it is one of a group of nationalist movements that has gained sway in eastern Europe in recent years, eroding the liberal consensus that held for nearly three decades since the fall of Communism.
TAKING ITS TOLL 
""We clearly are dealing with an attempt to sweep PiS scandals under the rug,"" said Slawomir Neumann, the head of the PO parliamentary caucus, on Friday.
In a sign that pressure is taking its toll on PiS, the party rushed a legislative amendment through parliament this week partially retreating from reforms that the European Union says undermined judicial independence. Supreme court justices who would have been forced to retire will be allowed to stay on.
Poland ""seems to be heading in the right direction,"" European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis told reporters in Warsaw on Friday. ""We need some time to do a deeper assessment of the legislation.""
Dombrovskis said the investigation into corruption in Poland's banking sector needs to be carried out quickly, ""but we cannot jump ahead of (its) conclusions"".
But the head of Poland's top court Malgorzata Gersdorf said on Friday that this week's partial reversal on judicial reforms was only one step forward, and other steps would need to be taken to preserve the rule of law.
""The adoption (of the legal) changes is slightly satisfying when it comes to the Supreme Court judges, but it's just the tip of the iceberg,"" she told reporters. Poland's Senate is expected to sign off on the legal changes on Friday.

It was not immediately clear whether the halt in deliveries would be extended again or whether the companies would insist that the German government formally revoke the licenses then.
German firms are not eligible for compensation for lost revenue unless the government has taken that step, according to one industry source.
""The companies have agreed to halt deliveries for now, but the situation may change if Saudi Arabia begins to demand damages for delayed deliveries,"" the source said.
Germany last week banned 18 Saudis suspected of involvement in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi from much of Europe on Monday and expanded a halt in arms sales to the kingdom.
It had already suspended the approval of future export licenses to Saudi Arabia but on Nov. 19 said it had also worked with industry to stop shipments of arms sales already approved.
No specific timetable was given at the time, but industry sources said an agreement had been struck to revisit the issue in early to mid-January. 
A spokesman for the economy ministry declined to comment on the timetable or the value of the goods held up.
The halt mainly affects a number of patrol boats being built for Saudi Arabia by privately held Luerrsen, which may jeopardize 300 jobs at a shipyard in the northeastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and four Cobra radar systems to be built by a consortium that includes France's Thales, Airbus and  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) of the United States.
Der Spiegel magazine reported on Friday that the goods were valued at around 2.5 billion euros.
It remains unclear how the freeze will impact multinational programmes such as the Eurofighter, built by a consortium of firms in Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain.
BAE Systems (LON:BAES), which led the Eurofighter campaign to win a 10 billion pound ($13 billion) contract from Saudi Arabia for 48 new Eurofighter Typhoon jets, is still finalizing that deal after signing a memorandum of understanding in March.
About a third of their components would come from Germany. ($1 = 0.7796 pounds)

YANGON (Reuters) - Groups representing journalists and lawyers in Myanmar handed a letter to the country's president on Friday outlining their concerns over the jailing of two Reuters reporters convicted of breaking state secrets laws.
The letter, given to President Win Myint at the inauguration of the semi-official Myanmar Press Council (MPC), pointed out contradictions in the case against Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, who were sentenced to seven years in jail in September.
Their convictions have raised questions about Myanmar's progress towards democracy and sparked an outcry from human rights advocates.
Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi said in September that the case had nothing to do with freedom of expression. She has also urged people to read the judgment in the case and ""point out where there has been a miscarriage of justice"".
The letter, signed by the Myanmar Journalist Network (MJN) and several other groups, including two countrywide lawyers' associations, said that because Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were employed as professional journalists their case should have been dealt with under the country's media law, not the colonial-era Official Secrets Act.
""The Official Secret Act was prescribed in order to prevent espionage. In modern times, that act is no longer appropriate and needs to be reviewed,"" the letter said. ""A sentence of seven years to each of the reporters is forbidding the media and denies the public's right to access information.""
Government spokesman Zaw Htay said at his twice-monthly news conference on Friday that the government could not interfere in the case as Myanmar's courts were independent. He confirmed that the president had received the letters from MPC members, but did not discuss them further.
The letter also said Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo had followed the facts on the ground to report stories of high public interest, had shown professional balance in seeking comment from police officers in order to tell both sides of the story and did not violate Myanmar's media law.
Before their arrest, the reporters had been working on an investigation into the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men and boys by security forces and Buddhist civilians in western Myanmar during an army crackdown that began in August last year. The operation sent more than 720,000 people fleeing to Bangladesh.
During the ceremony in the capital Naypyitaw, one of the newly-appointed MPC members, Thar Lun Zaung Htet, also handed over letters from the wives of the journalists and called on the president to review the case.
In response to the letters, Win Myint said he ""had to act on this case in accordance with the law and he will review this case in accordance with legal procedures"", according to Thar Lun Zaung Htet.

Defense lawyers this month appealed to the High Court against the conviction.

More than 120 migrants, from North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa, have arrived in Spain each day during November, following a record month in October with over 350 per day, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said.
""This is usually a time of slowing down on these routes, that is not happening in Spain,"" IOM spokesman Joel Millman told a news briefing. 
Migrants are using smaller and less seaworthy boats, he said.
About two dozen migrants drowned off the coast of Cadiz in November, he said. The sole survivor of another shipwreck, a teenage boy from Guinea now in hospital with severe hypothermia, told rescuers that he was traveling with nine others including his brother in an inflatable row boat from Tangiers, Morocco.
The arrival of hundreds of thousands of migrants into Europe has fueled the rise of far-right parties across the continent in recent years, although numbers have fallen over the past three years. Many thousands of people, mostly from Africa and the Middle East, have drowned at sea.
So far this year 104,506 migrants have arrived by sea in Europe and 2,075 have perished, according to the IOM's latest figures. Both figures are about two-thirds of last year's totals and around a quarter of the totals from 2016.
But while traffic on the main sea route from Libya to Italy has fallen sharply over the past year, in part due to agreements with Libyan armed groups to fight smuggling, travel has increased across the western Mediterranean to Spain. 
The route from Turkey to Greece, used by more than a million asylum seekers in 2015, was largely shut by an EU agreement with Turkey the following year. 
In addition to migrants arriving by sea in mainland Spain, Millman said 36 migrants had died trying to reach the Canary Islands this year, compared to just one last year, Millman said. 

""So that is becoming also a dangerous channel for migrants seeking to access Europe through the Canary Islands,"" he said of the islands, which are a part of Spain located in the Atlantic Ocean off the Moroccan coast.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - For nearly three decades Central European University has been a gateway to the West for thousands of students from ex-communist eastern Europe, offering U.S.-accredited degree programs in an academic climate that celebrates free thought and open debate.
Now that looks set to change as the graduate school founded in Budapest by U.S. financier George Soros in 1991 prepares to move to a new campus in Vienna after a lengthy battle with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government.
Orban, a conservative nationalist, accuses the Hungarian-born Soros of plotting to destroy European civilization by flooding the continent with immigrants. Soros says his support for refugees is one part of a wider humanitarian mission to back open societies around the globe.
Following legal changes widely seen as targeting CEU and strongly criticized by the European Union and rights groups, the university says it will leave Budapest if it does not get guarantees of academic freedom by Dec. 1.
Orban's government has ruled out any concessions to CEU, effectively marking the symbolic end of an era for higher education in Hungary, an EU member state, and raising the prospect of considerable upheaval for many students.
Recalling how studying for his MA and PhD degrees at CEU transformed his life, Otto Gecser, 43, said students there were brought into contact with ""cutting-edge research"" and that the university's diverse student body - drawn from all over Europe and the world - provided unique opportunities.
""We could learn a lot from them and I guess this ... trickles down through us when we teach at (our) universities,"" said Gecser, who now heads ELTE University's Sociology Department in Budapest.
More than 3,500 CEU alumni are currently working and teaching in Hungary. CEU also has joint projects with other Hungarian universities.
""FREEDOM OF SPEECH""
Echoing Gecser's comments, Hungarian academic Petra Bard, 42, said her legal studies at CEU had proved ""a transformative experience"" which taught her to think critically, to engage in debates and defend her views. 
""This is a different approach we learnt towards debating, towards challenging anything, any thought. What we were taught is freedom of academia, freedom of speech,"" she said. 
Hungarians comprise about 20 percent of the 1,320 students admitted to CEU for the 2018-19 academic year. Many others are from central and eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union and western Europe, with smaller numbers from further afield.
CEU says it will move its U.S.-accredited degree programs - accounting for the bulk of its courses - to Vienna, but currently enrolled students will remain in Budapest to complete their degrees. Around 600 new students are expected to be enrolled at CEU in Vienna next year.
Zsolt Enyedi, CEU's Pro-Rector for Hungarian Affairs, said the university's Hungarian language degree programs - a fraction of the courses offered - were accredited for five more years, so hopefully that would allow the Vienna-based students to come to Budapest for exchange programs and vice versa. 
But the changes will pose significant logistical challenges, in terms of visas, accommodation and residence permits, and commuting between the two cities - some 250 km (155 miles) apart - will become a way of life for many students and teachers.
""Unfortunately, we cannot be completely sure whether this is a model that is sustainable for the long term,"" said Enyedi.
""Obviously, if a considerable part of our education is concentrated in a different country, if CEU as an American institution is no longer present in Hungary then the bridge that we will be building in the future may be actually more between America and Austria, than America and Hungary.""
Enyedi said CEU would considerably increase stipends for the students in Austria to make studies affordable for Hungarians and other eastern Europeans.
""At the same time, I can imagine that the change will have an impact on our student body. It is easily imaginable that our west European intake will increase, probably we will have more Austrian students,"" he said.
CEU students plan to stage a protest before Hungary's parliament on Saturday and will be joined by students from other universities, but they realize there is little hope of changing the government's mind and many are bracing for upheaval.
""On a personal level, of course it will affect our studies because... moving will cause a lot of change,"" said Nassim Abi Ghanem, 28, from Lebanon, a PhD student.

""We have our supervisors, our classes that will be disrupted. Where we are going to live and how we are going to do all this personal day to day stuff? So yes, this adds anxiety to students.""

A state prosecutor's statement said the man was taken into custody at Sarajevo airport and was also suspected to have fought for Islamic State and rival Syrian militant group Nusra Front, an ex-al Qaeda affiliate, in Iraq and Syria.
It added that the detainee had been under investigation on suspicion of forming a terrorist group in Bosnia.
Citing sources close to the investigation, the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN) said the arrested man was believed to have assisted in the attack on the U.S. Embassy in which a Bosnian gunman shot and wounded a police guard before being wounded by a sniper and then apprehended.
The gunman, also an Islamist militant, was jailed for 18 years after his conviction but his term was reduced to 15 years in 2013 after he apologized for the attack.
Bosnian Muslims generally practice a moderate form of Islam but some have adopted radical Salafi Islam from foreign fighters who came to the country during its 1992-95 war to fight alongside Muslims against Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Croats.
Some radicalised Bosnians joined Islamic State to fight in Syria and Iraq. But police say there have been no more Bosnians leaving for Syria or Iraq since 2015, and that more than half of those who have returned home have been jailed under a law prohibiting fighting in wars in foreign countries.

The man, identified only as Hans H. for legal reasons, is alleged to have served in a Nazi SS-company at the largest Nazi death camp in Austria from summer 1944 to spring 1945. 
He is accused of having guarded inmates at the camp, about 20 km from the Austrian city of Linz, and during marches to forced labour sites, the office said in a statement.
""During the time of the crime, at least 36,223 people were killed at the Mauthausen concentration camp. The killings were mostly carried out through gassing, but also through 'death bath actions', injections and shootings, as well as through starvation and freezing,"" it said.
The suspect was ""aware of all the killing methods as well as the disastrous living conditions of the incarcerated people at the camp"" the statement said. It said he wanted to ""support or at least help make easier the many thousands of deaths carried out by the main perpetrator"".
The prosecutor's office said it was bringing the charges under new laws that allow the prosecution of people involved in the Nazi ""machinery of death"" even if they did not personally kill anyone.
Faced with the advancing age of the suspects, Germany has stepped up prosecutions of lower-ranking individuals since the 2011 conviction of John Demjanjuk, a guard at Sobibor death camp. That case established a new precedent that no proof of a specific crime was needed to convict a defendant.
In recent years, some other former SS camp guards have been convicted but died either before the conviction was legally binding or before they had to go behind bars.
Another 95-year-old German man who is on trial for assisting in the murder of hundreds of people at the Stutthof camp, near what is now the Polish city of Gdansk, this month told the court he had never been a Nazi and was not indifferent to the suffering of inmates.

An almost complete skeleton and other bone fragments were unearthed last month during work on an annex to the Holy See's imposing embassy compound near Rome's famous Villa Borghese museum.
The discovery sparked media stories suggesting the remains might belong to Emanuela Orlandi, the 15-year-old daughter of a Vatican employee who vanished in 1983, or to Mirella Gregori, another Rome teenager who disappeared the same year.
However, the judicial source said DNA testing showed the bones were male, while carbon dating showed they predated 1964.
The mystery surrounding Orlandi's fate has bedevilled Italians for decades, with that of Gregori thought linked to it.
Orlandi's disappearance was initially connected to a possible attempt by unknown persons to win freedom for Mehmet Ali Agca, the Turkish gunman who shot Pope John Paul II in 1981 and was then serving a life sentence in an Italian jail. 
In 2005, an anonymous caller to a television talk show said the secret to her kidnap was buried along with Enrico “Renatino” De Pedis, a mobster who once led the feared Magliana gang which terrorized Rome in the 1980s.
Police eventually opened his tomb in a Rome basilica in 2012 looking for clues but came up empty handed.

Matthew Hedges, 31, was sentenced on Wednesday on charges of spying for the British government, in a move described as deeply disappointing by Prime Minister Theresa May.
""Mr Hedges' family have made a request for clemency and the government is studying that request,"" the UAE's ambassador to London, Sulaiman Hamid Almazroui, said.
""We have an extremely close partnership with the UK,"" he told reporters. ""Because of the strength of that relationship we are hopeful that an amicable solution can be reached."" 
The doctoral student at Durham University has been held since May 5, when he was arrested at Dubai International Airport after a two-week research visit.
""We have asked for clemency - we will wait to see what happens,"" Hedges' wife Daniela Tejada told Reuters after the ambassador spoke. She denies he is a spy. 
His family have cast him as a talented researcher who fell foul of the UAE's security and justice system. The UAE cast him as a British spy who was given a fair trial for grave espionage offences.
""We hope the UAE now looks favourably on the family’s request for clemency,"" a spokeswoman for Britain's Foreign Office said. 
PARDON
The Gulf state does not dictate verdicts to its courts and there was full and proper legal process in Hedges' case, the ambassador said. There had not been a ""five minute show trial"" as he said some media had reported.
""This was an extremely serious case. We live in a dangerous neighborhood and national security must be a top priority,"" said Almazroui, adding that everyone had the right to request a pardon.
""This was an unusual case: many researchers visit the UAE freely every year without breaking our laws,"" he said.
Hedges' family said the evidence presented against him consisted of notes from his dissertation research.
""Matt was held in an undisclosed location in solitary confinement for over 5 months, with no charge, no lawyer and very limited consular access,"" his wife said. 
""The judicial system in the UAE and the UK cannot be compared. I was in the courtroom and the hearing lasted less than 5 minutes,"" she added.
A life sentence for a non-Emirati entails a maximum of 25 years in jail followed by deportation, according to UAE state-run media.

Andrei Karlov was shot dead by an off-duty policeman while speaking at an Ankara exhibit opening in December 2016. The gunman shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" and ""Don't forget Aleppo!"" as he opened fire, apparently referring to Russia's involvement in Syria. He was shot dead by police at the scene.
President Tayyip Erdogan has said Gulen's movement was behind the assassination, a charge the cleric has denied. Erdogan also blames the preacher's network for an attempted military coup in July 2016.
Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since 1999, has condemned the coup and denied any involvement with it. 
Authorities charged Gulen and 27 others of attempting to ""overthrow the constitutional order"", ""being a member of a terrorist organization"" and of premeditated murder, Anadolu said.
Prosecutors say the Gulen's organization was attempting to derail relations between Turkey and Russia with the killing. At the time of the December 2016 killing of Karlov, ties between the two countries had already been strained, after Turkey downed a Russian war plane over Syria a year earlier.

Since Karlov's assassination, ties between Ankara and Moscow have made steady improvement.

The attack, claimed by separatist insurgents from the impoverished southwestern Pakistani province of Baluchistan, killed four people, including two police, but it was far from the most deadly on a particularly violent day across the region.
A suicide attacker on a motorbike set off explosives in a crowded festival and market in northwest Pakistan's Orakzai region, killing at least 25 people at around the same time as the Karachi bloodshed.
Over the border in eastern Afghanistan, a suicide blast at a mosque on an army base killed at least 26 people and wounded 50, security officials said. Earlier in the week, a suicide bomber killed 55 people in the capital, Kabul.
The blood-letting comes as faint hopes for peace in Afghanistan have been stirred by two meetings between U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and the Taliban in Qatar.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday the United States was ""in very strong"" peace negotiations in Afghanistan but he did not know whether they would be successful.
The attack on China's consulate in Karachi was claimed by the separatist Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) insurgent group that opposes Chinese projects linked to its Belt and Road initiative in resource-rich Baluchistan.
Two policemen and two people waiting in a queue outside the consulate were killed in the attack, along with the three gunmen.
Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan called it ""part of conspiracy"" against Pakistani and Chinese economic and strategic cooperation and ordered an inquiry, his office said.
Pakistan has long accused its old rival, India, of supporting the nationalist insurgents in Baluchistan, while India accused Pakistan of nurturing Islamist militants throughout the region.
India denies helping the Baluchistan insurgents and was quick to condemn the violence.
""The perpetrators of this heinous attack should be brought to justice expeditiously,"" India's foreign ministry said in a statement.
India has for decades accused Pakistan of supporting Islamists fighting Indian security forces in the Indian part of the Himalayan region of Kashmir, where increasing violence flared again on Friday with Indian forces killing six militants in a clash.
India and the United States also accuse Pakistan of supporting the Afghan Taliban. Pakistan denies that.
'EXPLOITING RESOURCES'
As the Karachi attack unfolded, an explosion and gunshots rang out in its affluent Clifton neighborhood and a plume of smoke rose over the area.
City police chief Amir Shaikh said the three attackers came in a car filled with explosives but failed to get inside the heavily fortified compound. It was not clear if the car had exploded.
""They tried to get inside, but the Rangers and police killed one of the terrorists,"" Shaikh said.
A gun battle broke out with the two other attackers trying to enter the visa section, but they were also killed, he said.
A spokesman for the BLA confirmed there were three attackers.
""China is exploiting our resources,"" spokesman Jiand Baloch told Reuters by telephone.
China has funded development of a deep-water port at Gwadar in south Baluchistan, and is also investing in other projects on a China Pakistan Economic Corridor.
Baluchistan, which is on the borders of Afghanistan and Iran, has rich mineral and natural gas reserves but is Pakistan's poorest province. 
Separatists have for decades campaigned against what they see as the unfair exploitation of resources, in particular natural gas and minerals.
The Chinese government's top diplomat, Wang Yi, said he was ""shocked"" by the attack and urged Pakistan to prevent any more such incidents.
A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said China would ""continue unswervingly"" to work with Pakistan to develop economic projects.
The suicide bomb attack in the Afghan border province of Khost came as people gathered for Friday prayers at the mosque on the army base.
The Taliban, who are waging a war to oust the Western-backed Afghan government and expel foreign forces, have launched a series of high-profile attacks against Afghan security forces in recent weeks.
The blast in Pakistan's Orakzai region was also at a Friday festive gathering.

There was no claim of responsibility for either of those blasts.

683,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2018 08:00AM ET</span>",British PM faces parliamentary 'war of attrition' to deliver Brexit,"By William James
LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May's trial by parliament to deliver on her Brexit plan is only just beginning.
Between now and March 29, when Britain leaves the European Union, she faces dozens of make-or-break votes in a parliament split into myriad factions, many of which have only one thing in common: their loathing of her divorce deal with Brussels.
Attention is focused on the 'meaningful vote', expected in mid-December, when the 650-seat lower House of Commons decides whether to accept or reject the agreement outright. 
Like much about Brexit, uncertainty surrounds the process. But the Conservative prime minister will probably have to battle her way through procedural votes, and then fight attempts to amend the draft deal, even before the meaningful vote is held.
Assuming she wins this - and there might even be a repeat meaningful vote - she will then face a similar ordeal in turning the complex agreement into law, and all by March.
The task for May, who leads a minority government, is daunting. Eurosceptic lawmaker Steve Baker believes at least 54 of his fellow Conservatives are committed to voting against their leader. 
So what are May's chances of getting the deal through?
""Zero,"" he said.
The process does allow the government a little time. May's spokesman has said she believes the deal can get through parliament, and ministers will focus on winning support over the coming weeks.
""Every member of parliament is going to have to make their own judgment, make their own decision, on what is in the national interest,"" education minister Damian Hinds told the BBC.
So far May has survived a wave of ministerial resignations and a campaign within her own party to oust her. 
Once EU leaders formally sign off on the deal, expected on Sunday, the parliamentary process starts in earnest but the numbers seem stacked against the government.
The plan faces opposition from both eurosceptics and europhiles among her party's 314 active lawmakers, around 313 opposition members and 10 from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which is supposed to prop up the government.
VOTE ON A VOTE
First the government must secure a procedure that avoids rivals hijacking the process, either to block approval or attach conditions such as holding a second Brexit referendum. Whatever structure the government comes up with for the meaningful vote, it has to be approved by the House of Commons - with a vote.
Lawmakers are expected to debate the deal for at least five days and if usual procedure is applied, the government will need to defeat rival amendments. Failure at any stage could be fatal and prevent the deal being ratified.
Then comes the meaningful vote, a focus for financial markets where sterling has already been riding a political rollercoaster for weeks. 
Defeat could cast an orderly Brexit into doubt and end May's career. However, if she were to survive, she is expected by many to seek changes to the deal from the EU and then repeat the meaningful vote process.
""Then we could be into a situation of a war of attrition within parliament,"" said Labour's finance policy chief John McDonnell. 
TRENCH WARFARE
Even if she wins, May's drawn out agony will not be over: the government must then pass legislation implementing the withdrawal agreement. This involves line-by-line scrutiny in the lower house, where May is likely to have to defeat more amendments designed to alter or thwart her exit plan.
Each vote could come down to the choices of a handful of lawmakers.
""The government needs to bring back a deal that can unite the Conservative Party and our DUP allies,"" said Conservative lawmaker Mark Harper. ""That's the only way they can be reasonably confident that it can both win the meaningful vote and get the legislation through unscathed.""
It must also pass through the largely pro-EU upper House of Lords, where May's party has no majority. The lords are unlikely to block the process, but could demand changes.

If every stage of that bill is completed without incident, May can ratify the withdrawal agreement to bring an orderly end to Britain's EU membership.

Taliban leaders met U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad at their political headquarters in Qatar last week for the second time in the past month, and President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the United States was in ""very strong"" peace negotiations.
The Taliban, who are waging a war to oust the Western-backed Afghan government and expel foreign forces from Afghanistan, have launched a series of high-profile attacks against Afghan security forces in recent weeks.
""There are new-found opportunities in Afghanistan and there are very well founded hopes for peace,"" U.N. resident coordinator Toby Lanzer told reporters in Geneva. 
""It sounds like a paradox but there are better opportunities today than there have been in many, many, many years for Afghanistan to be at peace with itself and with its key neighbors.""
He declined to go into detail, but said discussions would go on in the coming days, weeks and months.
""What I can tell you is there is more coordination amongst the international community than we’ve witnessed in recent times. And there is more openness in certain sectors of the international community to make sure that everyone is part of the conversation. And those are two very important changes.""
The turning point came in February when the Afghan government said it was ready for talks without preconditions, and since then there had been a slow but steady outreach to parties with a stake in what was going on in Afghanistan, as well as to the Taliban, he said.
But after 40 years of instability, tremendous progress would not come within months.
""And I think that while this happens there will be spoilers, and there will people who want to derail things,"" he said, adding that the Islamic State armed group had exerted itself more in 2018 than in 2017 and would have to be dealt with.

686,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2018 06:56AM ET</span>",Britain's opposition Labour Party plots overthrow of capitalism,"By Andrew MacAskill and William James
LONDON (Reuters) - The British Labour Party's would-be finance minister, John McDonnell, has a message for the world: he is deadly serious about overthrowing capitalism and building a socialist society.
    McDonnell, 67, who describes Karl Marx as one of his main influences, has been at the vanguard of a left-wing revival in Britain's main opposition party under fellow socialist Jeremy Corbyn. He has promised sweeping nationalization, higher public spending and an overhaul of the banking system.
    Asked about his entry in the Who's Who directory of influential people which lists his passion for ""generally fermenting the overthrow of capitalism"", McDonnell said it was a joke about beer-making, but he agrees with the principle.
    ""I believe it. I am serious in my intent. I want to transform this economy,"" McDonnell told Reuters in an interview. ""That means evolving into a system which can achieve that equality, that democracy, that fairness, and tackles the major challenges that we are facing.""
    With Prime Minister Theresa May's grip on power looking ever more vulnerable as she faces the most perilous crisis of her premiership struggling to win backing for her Brexit deal, Labour are increasingly confident that they will be the next guardians of the world's fifth-largest economy.
    McDonnell's gambit is that the social discontent in Britain which fueled the shock 2016 Brexit vote runs much deeper, and that voters who feel left behind by decades of unchecked capitalism and wounded by years of public spending cuts will rally to his call.
    ""(It was) like everyone's grievance went into one vote,"" McDonnell said.
    The polls show that is only part of the picture: voters are tired of economic austerity and unhappy with May's Brexit negotiations, but Labour are only marginally ahead of the ruling Conservative Party. Some commentators have suggested they should be polling better against a government in disarray.
    Nevertheless, the combination of an unsated appetite for change and a Brexit-inspired political crisis which has trashed the centrist orthodoxy of British politics, has left Labour confident they will soon win power.
    McDonnell said his ambition is create the most radical government in modern British history even as the country is grappling with its exit from the European Union, the most complex negotiations in Europe since the end of World War Two. 
    
    COLLISION COURSE
    Labour's economic agenda has put the party on a collision course with business. But that has not fazed the party's leadership, which says that Britain's economic model is broken and requires radical reform. 
    The pillars of McDonnell's economic approach are public ownership and giving power back to the people, or what he describes as being ""in and against the state"".
    McDonnell has outlined a program of nationalizing the railways, energy and water companies and the postal service, raising taxes on businesses and the wealthy.  
    This would be combined with increased spending on education, skills training, and health care, and harnessing the financial sector to help fund a huge infrastructure investment.
    At his party's annual conference two months ago, McDonnell did little to conceal the scale of his ambition. Businesses were stunned by his plan to force all large companies to hand over a tenth of their equity to their workforce.
    Under the proposal every company with more than 250 staff would hand over 1 percent a year of equity over 10 years.
    Executives were particularly taken back because McDonnell has repeatedly told them over the last year that he had ""nothing up my sleeve"" in terms of unwelcome new policies. 
    
    BETTER SALESMAN
McDonnell's world view is shaped by his upbringing, he was born in the blue-collar city of Liverpool. His father was a docker, his mother was a cleaner at a department store, who also spent time on the biscuit counter.
As a young man, McDonnell briefly considered becoming a priest before attending night school to gain qualifications that allowed him to go on to study politics at university.
    The challenge for McDonnell, as the next potential finance minister, is to walk the line between being radical for the party's supporters and reassuring for business. 
    Allies who have watched his progression from the obscure fringes of Tony Blair's centrist Labour Party to the heart of decision-making say he has evolved as a better salesman, capable of promoting his policies without scaring mainstream voters.  
    ""He's now in a position of leadership where he's realized he has to compromise and he has to make the policies saleable,"" said Austin Mitchell a former Labour member of parliament and fellow socialist campaigner. 
    McDonnell has worked hard to improve his relationship with big companies. Yet despite a shared interest in close ties with the EU and higher infrastructure spending, business remains wary over taxation and demands for greater state intervention.
    Business executives who recently met McDonnell said he came across as affable and pragmatic, and the party's manifesto last year was more modest than many expected.
    Others think his courting of business is a ruse. Only a few years ago he endorsed ""insurrection"" as a way of changing the government and praised a worker for spitting in her boss's tea.
    ""We are not sure whether we can trust him,"" said one senior finance executive, who recently met him. ""He can be charming. But we have a nagging doubt that he is going shaft us.""
    But Labour's plans are striking a chord with many Britons who have endured stagnant wage growth and are increasingly uneasy about the deregulation and privatizations over the last three decades.
    About half of voters back the renationalisation of the railways, electricity and gas companies. While a poll by the Institute for Public Policy Research found half of Britons think the economy has become less fair over the past decade.
    McDonnell believes that economic climate will allow him to push through an agenda that he wants to be more radical than the Prime Minister Clement Attlee's post-war government, which created the National Health Service and the modern welfare state, and Margaret Thatcher's taming the power of the unions.   
    He cites the rising levels of homelessness and a report by the United Nations last week that found the government is in a state of denial about the impact of its policies on the poor.

    Even the wealthy ""don't want to step outside their office and as they go to their car step over a homeless person"", McDonnell said. ""So we are looking for change and I think we are reflecting the mood.""

Turkey and the United States, both NATO allies, have seen their relationship strained by differences over Syria policy. Washington has backed the YPG Kurdish militia in the fight against Islamic State. Turkey says the YPG is a terrorist group and an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).
In May they reached a deal over Manbij, after months of disagreement, under which Kurdish fighters are to completely withdraw from the town - something Turkey says has yet to happen.
This month, Turkish and U.S. troops began joint patrols in the region. That cooperation has been complicated as Turkey has shelled Kurdish fighters to the east of the Euphrates, across the river from Manbij, and threatened an offensive there. 
""This delay should not exist anymore. This issue needs to be completed by the end of the year,"" Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told broadcaster CNN Turk, referring to the withdrawal of the YPG from Manbij.
""Joint patrols have begun in Manbij and YPG needs to withdraw immediately from here. When we start implementing the same roadmap on the east of the Euphrates as well, YPG/PKK will be thrown out of all the cities,"" he said.
The YPG are the core of a force that has fought against Islamic State with the support of U.S. air power, arms, funds, training and an estimated 2,000 American special forces troops on the ground.
Turkey has already intervened to sweep YPG fighters from territory west of the Euphrates in military campaigns over the past two years, but has not gone east of the river, in part to avoid direct confrontation with Washington.
However, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has more recently signalled that Turkey was ready to expand operations.
The YPG still controls are large swathe of northeast Syria, on Turkey's southern border. Turkey fears the YPG's presence across its border could fuel a Kurdish insurgency at home.

More than 40,000 people, most of them Kurds, have died since the autonomy-seeking PKK first took up arms against the Turkish state in 1984.

One security official said the victims had gathered for Friday prayers at the mosque in the Ismail Khel district of Khost province.
All those killed in the suicide attack were working for the Afghan security forces, said Captain Abdullah, a military spokesman in Khost, who goes by only one name.
The Taliban, who are waging a war to oust the Western-backed Afghan government and expel foreign forces from Afghanistan, have launched a series of high-profile attacks Taliban against Afghan security forces in recent weeks.

Western countries are pressing for a ceasefire and renewed peace efforts to end the country's three-year-old conflict amid international concern that half the population, or some 14 million people, could soon be on the brink of famine.
U.N. spokesman Rheal LeBlanc told reporters in Geneva that U.N. envoy Martin Griffiths had specific ideas about managing the port that he would present to the parties to the conflict.
""As he (Griffiths) has said many times, the UN stands ready to work with the parties on a negotiated agreement, to grant a supervisory role for the UN in managing the port, which would protect the port itself from potential destruction, and preserve the main humanitarian pipeline to the people of Yemen,"" LeBlanc said.
Griffiths arrived earlier in the day in Hodeidah, the latest focus of the war between the Houthi group, which controls the city, and pro-government forces backed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. 
The port is an important supply line to the Houthi-controlled capital Sanaa, located in mountains to the northeast of Hodeidah, as well as to much of the rest of the country.
Griffiths told the U.N. Security Council last week that Yemen's parties had given ""firm assurances"" they were committed to attending peace talks he hopes to convene in Sweden in December.
LeBlanc said Griffiths wanted a stop to a recent escalation in fighting around Hodeidah in order to ""create a conducive environment"" for the Sweden consultations. 
Griffiths visited Sanaa on Thursday to talk to Houthi leaders about their attendance in Sweden.
The Saudi-led, Western-backed coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 to restore the internationally-recognized government that was ousted from Sanaa in 2014 by the Houthis.
The last available figure from the United Nations for the death toll from the conflict, seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, was in 2016 and stood at more than 10,000.

An estimated 85,000 children under five may have starved to death in Yemen since 2015, Save the Children said on Thursday.

Leaders of Islamist party PAS, former ruling party UMNO and conservative groups plan a rally next month against the convention, which they fear could strip away Malay privileges and threaten Islam's position as the official religion.
The government will not ratify the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), the office of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said in a statement, without giving a reason for the decision.
Mahathir's ruling coalition has struggled to woo ethnic Malays after its spectacular election win in May on the back of overwhelming support from minority ethnic Chinese and Indian voters.
""The government will continue to uphold the federal constitution, which enshrines the social contract agreed by representatives of all races,"" it said in the statement.
Malaysia's 'social contract' was a pact made by the leaders of its Malay and minority Chinese and Indian ethnic groups regarding their rights and privileges as citizens, prior to independence from colonial ruler Britain in 1957.
The country adopted an affirmative action policy that benefits the Malays, who form 60 percent of a population of about 32 million, after deadly race riots in the late 1960s.
Ethnic Chinese are estimated at 23 percent and ethnic Indians comprise about 7 percent, government data shows.
In September, Mahathir told the United Nations General Assembly Malaysia would ratify all the human rights conventions left for it to adopt, a total of six, including the racial discrimination measure.
""Muslims, the religious, the bumiputera and all races must unite to oppose the ICERD agenda, because its concept is not based on religion or humanity,"" said PAS leader Abdul Hadi Awang, using a term commonly employed to assert Malay privileges.
""Do not be influenced by the West that has abandoned religion and the ethics of true humanity,"" he said on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page on Thursday.
About 30 percent of Malay voters backed the ruling party in the May 9 general election, independent polling firm Merdeka Center found in a study of voting patterns published in June.
The long-ruling Barisan Nasional coalition, led by the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), received about 40 percent of Malay votes while PAS was backed by up to 33 percent, it said.

Former Macedonian premier Nikola Gruevski fled to Hungary earlier this month after being sentenced to two years in prison over corruption-related charges. Hungary's foreign minister said Hungarian diplomats accompanied him to Budapest.
Gruevski received political asylum on Tuesday, prompting criticism from Macedonia, the European Union and the United States.
Orban said he and Gruevski, who resigned in 2016 after a decade in power, had fought side by side to stop mass migration through the Balkans, which made Macedonia, and Gruevski personally, an ally.
""I know this man, he was a colleague of mine for a long time,"" Orban told state radio mr1 in an interview. ""It would have been a lot harder, if not impossible, to defend the Hungarian border without him.""
""One treats their allies fairly. If he turns to us, he can expect due process. We can't place him above the law, but we can give him due process.""
Macedonian police had issued an arrest warrant for Gruevski after he failed to show up to begin his sentence, following a Nov. 9 court ruling against his motion for a reprieve.
Orban said Macedonian legal proceedings against Gruevski were politically-tinged so they should not influence Hungarian authorities.
""Complex political struggles and games are happening in Macedonia, and the justice system is a part of that,"" he said. ""Macedonian proceedings have no influence over us. We only care if the (asylum) request is legally sound.""
Orban dismissed international criticism of Hungary's help in helping ferry Gruevski across the Balkans to Budapest and its sheltering of him as the work of organizations and people tied to U.S. financier George Soros.

Soros could not immediately be reached for comment. But the Budapest-born philanthropist has denied repeated accusations by Orban that he and his Open Society Foundations have undermined Europe's way of life by encouraging migration.

On Tuesday, Trump vowed to remain a ""steadfast partner"" of Saudi Arabia despite saying that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman may have known about the plan to murder Khashoggi last month.
Criticizing Trump's stance for putting commercial deals with Riyadh ahead of justice, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said human life should take precedence.
""This statement that Trump made also means: 'No matter what happens, I will turn a blind eye.' This is not a correct approach. Not everything is money,"" Cavusoglu told broadcaster CNN Turk.
He also said the United States had not informed Turkey of an audio recording regarding Khashoggi's killing, a day after a Turkish newspaper said that the CIA had signaled to Turkey it had a recording in which the crown prince ordered to ""silence Khashoggi"".
Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan has said the order for Khashoggi's killing came from the highest level of the Saudi government but probably not King Salman, putting the spotlight instead on Salman's heir and de facto ruler Prince Mohammed.
A day after conflicting Turkish media reports over whether Erdogan would meet Prince Mohammed at a G20 summit in Argentina next week, Cavusoglu said there was no reason why a meeting could not take place, but the final decision was Erdogan's.
The president has not directly accused the crown prince of organizing the killing, and the Saudi government has denied that he had prior knowledge of the 15-man hit team - including a senior intelligence officer in the prince's security team - which was sent to Turkey and killed Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate.

""We cannot accuse one person without definite evidence, this is not correct,"" Cavusoglu said. ""However, the 'it may be, it may not be' statement seemed interesting to us.""

PORT BLAIR (Reuters) - Indian authorities said on Friday they are investigating whether a young American believed to have been killed by an isolated tribe on a remote island, may have had help from more people than initially thought to make his illegal trip.
John Chau, 26, was allegedly killed on Nov. 17 by people of the Sentinelese tribe who inhabit the North Sentinel Island in the Andaman and Nicobar island chain. Chau's family said in a social media post he was a Christian missionary and mountaineer.
It is illegal for people to visit the island and seven people suspected of helping Chau reach it, including fishermen, have been arrested.
The fishermen told police that they saw Chau's body being dragged across a beach and buried in the sand. 
Police are now investigating if Chau had help from other people to travel to North Sentinel, said Vijay Singh, senior superintendent of police in Andaman and Nicobar islands, in a statement. 
Police plan to investigate ""the sequence of events, the sea route followed"", and other matters, said Singh.
The Sentinelese, hunter-gatherers armed with primitive spears and bows and arrows, are considered to be the last pre-Neolithic tribe in the world and the most isolated such group.
The tribe, estimated to be only a few dozen in number, have for decades aggressively resisted contact with the outside world. 
Anthropologists were briefly in contact with the tribe in the early 1990s, but their effort was abandoned due to fears that contact with the outside world could expose the tribe to pathogens and lead to their extinction. 
North Sentinel, 50 km (31 miles) west of Port Blair - the capital of the island cluster - is protected by laws which bar even fishing within a 5-nautical mile radius of the island. 
The law also bars tourism or photography of the Sentinelese and certain other tribes in the Andaman islands. Those found guilty of breaking the law face jail of up to three years.
In their social media post, Chau's family called on authorities to release his friends in the Andaman Islands saying they did not blame anyone for his death.
Dependra Pathak, director general of police in the Andaman and Nicobar islands, told Reuters police had to follow the law.
""I understand the emotional concern of the family,"" he said. ""But we'll be handling the entire issue keeping in mind the law.""
He said authorities were looking into whether they could retrieve Chau's body. 

""We have to respect the utmost sensitivities in this case,"" he said, adding it was a moral duty to protect and respect the tribe that has lived in isolation for millennia.

Since his surprise appointment last month, Rajapaksa has twice lost confidence votes in parliament to lawmakers backing his predecessor Ranil Wickremesinghe, who has challenged his ouster as illegal.
Wickremesinghe has refused to vacate the prime minister's official residence, while Rajapaksa, a former president who won a civil war against Tamil separatists rebels, has moved into the prime minister's office.
Wickremesinghe loyalists have moved a motion to slash Rajapaksa's budget on the grounds that his administration was illegitimate. On Friday, they insisted on a vote to approve a 13-member parliamentary committee that would conduct further business of the house.
The Committee on Selection takes key decisions of the house and appoints other committees in the legislature that could determine the fate of the motion to curb Rajapaksa's office expense.
Lawmakers loyal to Rajapaska said the formation of the committee was illegal and they accused Speaker Karu Jayasuriya of being biased against them.
They walked out of the chamber just as the composition of the committee was put to vote, leaving Wickremesinghe to win by a margin of 121 votes to nil in the 225-member house. 
""The speaker is biased and he has disregarded all the parliament conventions,"" Wimal Weerawansa, a Rajapaksa loyalist. told the parliament before the group walked out of the chamber.
Udaya Gammanpila, another Rajapaksa loyalist, said their party would refuse to accept Jayasuriya as the speaker. 
The political stalemate has dragged on for nearly a month since President Maithripala Sirisena sacked Wickremensinghe and appointed Rajapaksa in his place. Last week, lawmakers supporting Rajapaksa threw books, chili paste and water bottles at the speaker to try to disrupt a confidence vote.

A vote on the motion to remove funding for staff salaries in Rajapaksa's administration and other costs is set for Nov. 29.

PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - A suicide bomb attack on a crowded festival and market in northwest Pakistan's northwest killed at least 25 people on Friday and wounded 20, a government official said.
The blast occurred at around the same time that three attackers tried to storm the Chinese consulate in the southern city of Karachi. Two policemen and the three attackers were killed.
The Karachi attack was claimed by a separatist insurgent group called the Balochistan Liberation Army, and did not appear to be connected to the attack on the market in the northwestern region of Orakzai.
In Orakzai, a suicide bomber drove a motorcycle into a crowd attending a festival and market that attracts people from different religious communities, before detonating his explosives.
No group claimed responsibility.
""It was a suicide blast at the festival that takes place every Friday,"" said Abbas Khan, the assistant commissioner of the district, told Reuters. 
Khan said that among the 25 dead were three members of the minority Sikh community and two security officials.
The Geo television channel showed footage of military officials cordoning off the bomb site.
Orakzai was formerly a semi-autonomous part of Pakistan's ethnic Pashtun tribal area along the Afghan border.
The region was for decades a refuge for Islamist militants fighting in Afghanistan, and more recently against the Pakistani state. 
The Pakistani military stepped up operations along the border in 2009 and has managed to clear some areas of militants.
The tribal areas were incorporated into the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in May.

Hodeidah has become the focus of the war between the Iran-aligned Houthi group, which controls the city, and pro-government forces backed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
Griffiths told the U.N. Security Council last week that Yemen's parties had given ""firm assurances"" they were committed to attending peace talks he hopes to convene in Sweden before the end of the year.
The U.N. envoy met with the management of Hodeidah port, an important supply line to the Houthi-controlled capital Sanaa.
Griffiths visited Sanaa on Thursday where he met with Houthi leaders to discuss their attendance in the next round of consultations, expected in early December. 
The Saudi-led, Western-backed coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 to restore the internationally-recognized government that was ousted from Sanaa in 2014 by the Houthis.
Western countries are pressing for a ceasefire and renewed peace efforts to end the conflict amid international concern that half the population, or some 14 million people, could soon be on the brink of famine.
The last available figure from the United Nations for the death toll from the conflict, seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, was in 2016 and stood at more than 10,000.

An estimated 85,000 children under five may have starved to death in Yemen since 2015, Save the Children said on Thursday.

Heng's appointment as the first assistant secretary general of the People's Action Party follows months of behind-the-scenes moves to select a new leader, a departure from the wealthy city-state's normally orderly and anticipated succession process. 
In a post on the party's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, Prime Minister Lee said members of its top decision making body, the Central Executive Committee, had picked Heng to be their leader.
""I support the decision of the younger team, and am happy with this outcome,"" Lee said, adding that he would soon reshuffle the cabinet.
The role is immediately under the secretary general position, now held by Lee. He has pledged to step down in coming years, with an election expected as soon as next year.
""Going by the PAP’s past practice, the next-generation leader designated to succeed the current top leader is usually made first assistant secretary general of the ruling party,"" said Eugene Tan, a law professor at Singapore Management University (SMU).
""This was the case for both Mr Goh Chok Tong and Mr Lee Hsien Loong when they were understudying their predecessors,"" said Tan, an expert on Singapore's political process, referring to the island's second and current prime ministers.
The potential leadership transition comes as rising global protectionism threatens the city-state's open economy, while at home the government tries to tackle growing unease over wealth disparity and social mobility.
Heng, 57, was one of three ministers tipped this year to succeed Lee, 66. He is the most experienced of the leading candidates but concerns about his health after he suffered a stroke and collapsed during a cabinet meeting in 2016 had raised questions about his suitability.

Another of the three, Trade Minister Chan Chun Sing, 49, was appointed second assistant secretary general on Friday, a key leadership position that puts him as Heng's deputy.

In a meeting of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in The Hague on Thursday, ambassador Kenneth Ward reiterated U.S. concerns that Iran maintained a chemical weapons program that it has failed to declare to the agency.
""Once again America has leveled groundless accusations against Iran ... which we strongly reject,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by Iranian TV.
Washington's aim, Qasemi said, was to divert international attention from its continued support for Israeli chemical arsenals. Iran does not recognize Israel.
Israel neither confirms nor denies having weapons of mass-destruction. It signed the Chemical Weapons Convention in 1993, but has yet to ratify it, saying that should be preceded by progress in Middle East peacemaking. 
Tension has increased between Washington and Tehran since May, when President Donald Trump reimposed sanctions after pulling out of a 2015 nuclear deal, under which they had been lifted, between Iran and six major powers.

SRINAGAR, India (Reuters) - Indian troops killed six separatist militants in a gunbattle in the disputed region of Kashmir on Friday, the army said, taking the death toll for the year to the highest in nearly a decade.
So far this year, 400 people have been killed in Kashmir, India's only Muslim majority state, and more than half of them were guerrillas fighting Indian rule. It is the highest toll since 2008 when 505 people died.
Indian forces have stepped up an offensive against militants operating inside the Kashmir Valley as well as those trying to intrude from across the border with Pakistan, officials say. 
The militants have hit back, targeting members of the Kashmir police and their families in recent months. 
Indian army spokesman Rajesh Kalia said an operation was launched in Sekipora village, around 50 kms (32 miles) south of Srinagar, after intelligence reports about the presence of a group of militants.
""Six militants were killed during a fierce gunfight and arms and ammunition along with their bodies have been recovered,"" Kalia said.
Among the dead was a member of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba who police say was part of the group that gunned down a top newspaper editor, Syed Shujaat Bukhari, outside his office in June.
The number of deaths in violence in Jammu and Kashmir had dropped to 99 in 2012 but has been climbing since. 
The latest crackdown in southern Kashmir, which has been a hotbed of militant violence, was prompted by the abduction of six people from the area by militants. 
While four were let off, the militants killed two whom they accused of being informers for the Indian security forces. One of them was beheaded, while a video of the assailants pumping bullets into the other went viral on the social media.
Nuclear-armed India and Pakistan both claim Kashmir and have fought two of their three wars over the Himalayan region since their separation in 1947.
A military Line of Control (LoC) divides the Indian and Pakistani sides, with India ruling 45 percent of Kashmir and the bulk of its more than 11 million population. Pakistan has about 35 percent of the territory and China controls the rest.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Police in Muslim-majority Indonesia have questioned the head of one of its newest and most progressive parties, who is battling accusations of ""Islamophobia"" from rival politicians, after she said her party opposed the growth of bylaws based on religion. 
Indonesia is officially secular and has a tradition of pluralism but Islam has increasingly crept into politics in a country home to significant Christian, Hindu and other religious minorities.
Grace Natalie set up the Indonesian Solidarity Party (PSI), often dubbed the ""millennials party"", in 2014 to offer an alternative for young voters disillusioned by traditional parties often run by an entrenched elite.
In a speech this week attended by President Joko Widodo, Natalie, who is ethnic Chinese, spoke out against intolerance, saying PSI would not support local regulations based on Islamic law or Christian scripture.
""We want to return back to the constitution so that there is a guarantee for all citizens, whatever their background, or religion they believe, or faith they have,"" said Natalie, whose party is part of a coalition backing Widodo's bid for a second term in 2019 elections. 
Police questioned Natalie following a complaint filed by Eggi Sudjana, a lawyer and politician of an Islamic party, who told Reuters her comments breached laws on hate speech and attacked religion. He urged her to apologize. 
Some rival politicians also accused her of ""Islamophobia"", while defending the adoption of bylaws based on sharia or religious values.
Jakarta police are still investigating to determine if any law was broken, said spokesman Argo Yuwono.
In a party statement, Natalie said that during six hours of questioning she had told police her speech referred to ""a willingness to implement equality and justice for all citizens before the law"".
She also said it was based on an academic study showing how religion-based rules could affect women and minority groups. 
The only province in Indonesia allowed to enforce Islamic law is Aceh, but other regions have adopted bylaws enforcing elements of sharia. 
Such bylaws were divisive, said Muhammad Abdullah Darraz, director of the Maarif Institute, which promotes religious and cultural harmony, who defended Natalie.
""We have witnessed identity politics recently emerging and it has the potential to divide the unity of the nation,"" he said.
Indonesia's state ideology includes national unity, social justice and democracy alongside belief in God, and enshrines religious diversity in a secular system of government.
But religious and political tension has spiraled in the last few years after Islamists led hundreds of thousands in Jakarta protests against the capital’s then governor, an ethnic Chinese Christian charged with insulting the Koran.
Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, a Widodo ally, lost his bid for re-election in 2017 to a Muslim rival after a radical group, the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) agitated against him for months.

He was jailed for two years over blasphemy.

Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, is the founder of the English Defence League, which has staged violent demonstrations against Islam.
Under current UKIP party rules, he is barred from joining the party, leading party leader Gerard Batten to appoint him as an adviser in a personal capacity.
""It is not necessary for him to be a party member in order to assist me in this role. I am looking forward to working with him,"" Batten said, according to the BBC.
UKIP currently has no members of parliament in Westminster, but was an influential voice in calling for a referendum on European Union membership, and campaigning to leave, under former leader Nigel Farage.
The party has splintered since the June 2016 vote to leave the EU and underwent a lengthy struggle to find the right leader to replace Farage.
Batten has pushed a more anti-Islam message since, and some have criticized his engagement with far-right figures.
Farage told the BBC Radio that Batten's appointment of Robinson risked tarnishing the party and possibly the whole Brexit process.

""From every single aspect, it's time we got rid of Gerard Batten and reclaimed the party,"" Farage said.

HONGCHEON, South Korea (Reuters) - For most people, prison is a place to escape from. For South Koreans in need of a break from the demands of everyday life, a day in a faux jail is the escape.
""This prison gives me a sense of freedom,"" said Park Hye-ri, a 28-year-old office worker who paid $90 to spend 24 hours locked up in a mock prison.
Since 2013, the ""Prison Inside Me"" facility in northeast Hongcheon has hosted more than 2,000 inmates, many of them stressed office workers and students seeking relief from South Korea's demanding work and academic culture.
""I was too busy,"" said Park as she sat in a 5-sq-m (54-sq-foot) cell. ""I shouldn't be here right now, given the work I need to do. But I decided to pause and look back at myself for a better life."" 
(To see accompanying package, click on https://reut.rs/2qZ4D1a)
Prison rules are strict. No talking with other inmates. No mobile phones or clocks.
Clients get a blue prison uniform, a yoga mat, tea set, a pen and notebook. They sleep on the floor. There is a small toilet inside the room, but no mirror.
The menu includes steamed sweet potato and a banana shake for dinner, and rice porridge for breakfast. 
Co-founder Noh Ji-Hyang said the mock prison was inspired by her husband, a prosecutor who often put in 100-hour work weeks.
""He said he would rather go into solitary confinement for a week to take a rest and feel better,"" she said. ""That was the beginning.""
A downturn in South Korea's high-tech, export-driven economy has intensified a hyper-competitive school and work environment that experts say adds to a high incidence of stress and suicide.
South Koreans worked 2,024 hours on average in 2017, the third longest after Mexico and Costa Rica, in a survey of 36 member countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
To help people work less and earn more, the government has raised the minimum wage and cut the legal cap on working hours to 52 per week from 68. But the policies could backfire and put at risk more jobs than they create, economists say.
Noh said some customers are wary of spending 24 or 48 hours in a prison cell, until they try it. 

""After a stay in the prison, people say, 'This is not a prison, the real prison is where we return to,'"" she said.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's government faces a test of confidence at local elections this weekend as President Tsai Ing-wen grapples with rising pressure from China and criticism that her reform agenda has slowed.
Saturday's mayoral and magisterial elections could also be a bellwether for the 2020 presidential election, just over a year away, say observers.
China has become increasingly concerned that Tsai wants to push for formal independence and has ramped up pressure to assert its sovereignty over the democratic island.
Beijing regards self-ruled Taiwan as part of China and has vowed to use force if necessary to keep the island.
In a post on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Tsai has urged people to ""vote for Taiwan's democracy"" and rallied support for her party in a bid to ""boost the energy of reform and progress"".
More than 11,000 seats are up for grabs in municipalities, counties, townships and villages, with the southern city of Kaohsiung a key battleground for the ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP), which has held the city for two decades.
Tsai's government has repeatedly said China is attempting to affect election results with its ""political bullying"" and ""fake news"", an accusation Beijing calls ""fabrication"".
Widely-read Chinese state-run tabloid the Global Times said in a Friday editorial that Taiwan's government was ""canvassing for votes by inciting people's hate against the Chinese mainland"".
""This is a tragedy of Taiwan's democracy,"" it said. 
Tensions across the Taiwan Strait have heightened with China conducting military drills around the island and snatching away Taiwan's dwindling number of diplomatic allies.
Tsai's reform initiatives, from the island's pension scheme to labor law, have also come under intense voter scrutiny recently, say observers. 
Confidence in the government has waned in recent months after reform moves upset both the opposition and some supporters, who said Tsai had backed away from promises to reduce the deficit and pollution. 
Some reforms have ""stoked a lot of controversy"" and the DPP is facing challenges from the China-friendly opposition Kuomintang, said Edwin Yang, associate professor at National Taiwan Normal University. 
Underscoring Tsai's challenge will be a series of public votes on Saturday on whether to make same-sex marriage legal, an issue which has deeply divided Taiwan.
Tsai has made little progress despite campaigning on a promise of marriage equality in the run-up to elections in 2016.
In Asia's first such ruling, Taiwan's constitutional court declared in May last year that same-sex couples had the right to legally marry, and set a two-year deadline for legalization.
Voters will also be asked whether the island should join the 2020 Tokyo Olympics as Taiwan, rather than ""Chinese Taipei"" – the name agreed under a compromise signed in 1981. A vote to compete under a Taiwan banner would further rile Beijing.

Tsai has repeatedly emphasized maintaining the status quo with China, but Beijing has become angry at recent U.S. overtures toward Taiwan, which include encouraging senior U.S. officials to visit the island. Washington has no formal ties with Taiwan but is its main source of arms.

The statement by the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency is a further sign that North Korea is pressing ahead with its atomic activities despite pressure from the United States for it to scrap its nuclear weapons program.
At a leaders' summit in June both sides pledged to work toward the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
Since then, few concrete steps have been made toward the full and irreversible dismantling of North Korea's nuclear arms program that Washington has called for.
At Yongbyon, North Korea's main nuclear facility which is widely believed to have provided fissile material for its bombs, components appear to have been brought into a light-water reactor being built there, IAEA chief Yukiya Amano said.
""At the light water reactor, the agency also observed activities consistent with the fabrication of reactor components and the possible transfer of these components into the reactor building,"" Amano said in a statement to the IAEA's Board of Governors, reporting on the period since August.
The IAEA has not had access to North Korea since 2009 and mainly monitors activities there through satellite imagery, meaning it cannot confirm its observations.
North Korea also appeared to have continued work at the nearby Kuryong River that it dammed last year to increase the supply of water available for cooling the planned reactor or the existing experimental one, which has an output capacity of 5 Megawatts.
""Further activities were observed near the Kuryong River. These may be related to changes to the cooling infrastructure for the 5MW(e) reactor and the light water reactor,"" Amano said, adding that the experimental reactor was likely shut down while some of those unspecified activities were carried out.
Amano referred to a meeting between North and South Korea in September at which the North expressed its readiness to take measures including a permanent dismantlement of its main nuclear facilities in Yongbyon should there be unspecified corresponding action from the United States.

Apart from an annual report on developments in North Korea, the IAEA does not normally comment on what it sees there, suggesting that Amano's comments were aimed at illustrating the continued activity at Yongbyon.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Strong winds across Australia's southeast coast on Friday caused commuter chaos at Sydney and Melbourne airports, the country's two busiest, with thousands of air travelers stranded after dozens of flights were canceled.
Winds gusting up to 70 kmh (44 mph) also fanned major bushfires along the east coast, threatening homes and forcing evacuations.
Sydney Airport canceled 76 flights after all but one runway was closed due to the strong winds, reducing flight movements to 23 per hour, more than half the usual rate.
""It’s not safe to have flights landing or departing and as a result we are going to a single runway, there are delays,"" Sydney Airport told Reuters.
Melbourne Airport also reduced the number of flights allowed to arrive and depart each hour due to Sydney Airport cancellations.
The strong winds fanned fires across New South Wales state, with Australia's Rural Fire Service reporting 21 fires.
A Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 modified for use as a waterbomber was used to fight bushfires around the city of Newcastle, north of Sydney, said the Rural Fire Service. The aircraft can carry 15,000 liters (3,960 gallons) of water or fire retardant.
""(This) was the first operational drop that its done in the world...it has proven to be effective,"" Chris Garlick, a spokesman for the NSW Rural Fire Services told Reuters. 
Fires around the popular tourist spot of Port Stephens, nearly 200 km (124 miles) north of Sydney, forced an emergency evacuation of residents. There were no reports of injuries or loss of property. Emergency workers warned the strong winds threaten to escalate the fires.
The strong winds are part of a massive weather system over southeast Australia, that whipped up a 500 km (310 miles) dust storm on Thursday, which swept across the drought-pratched interior to blanket Sydney.
The weather system also brought snow storms to southern parts of the country and around the national capital Canberra, due to icy winds and low temperatures in the southern end of the storm cell.
The Australian Bureau of Meteorology said winds would ease by Friday evening, offering some respite to travelers and fire fighters.

The prince, the country's de facto ruler, is also expected to participate in a G20 meeting in Buenos Aires at the end of the month which will be attended by leaders from the United States, Turkey and European countries.
The killing of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and a critic of the crown prince, at Riyadh's consulate in Istanbul six weeks ago has strained Saudi Arabia's ties with the West and battered Prince Mohammed's image abroad.
King Salman asked his chosen heir, known in the West as MbS, to conduct the tour ""based on his keenness to deepen the kingdom's ties regionally and internationally"", the Saudi Press Agency reported.
Prince Mohammed was greeted upon his arrival in the neighbouring UAE by Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nayhan, a close ally of MbS.
""We’re proud of our deep-rooted ties. Close cooperation and a fruitful partnership lies in store for our countries. The UAE will always be a loving and supportive home for our brothers in Saudi Arabia,"" Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed said in a Twitter post.
Tunisian newspaper, Business News, said he is expected to visit Tunisia on Tuesday.
Saudi Arabia has said the prince had no prior knowledge of the murder of the prominent Saudi journalist. After offering numerous contradictory explanations, Riyadh said last week Khashoggi had been killed and his body dismembered when negotiations to persuade him to return to Saudi Arabia failed.
Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan has said the killing was ordered by the highest level of Saudi leadership but probably not from King Salman, putting the spotlight instead on the 33-year-old crown prince.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday Washington would remain a ""steadfast partner"" of Saudi Arabia despite saying that Prince Mohammed may have known about the plan to murder Khashoggi.

716,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2018 11:40PM ET</span>","In Tanzania, a bulldozer president tests donors","By Omar Mohammed and Maggie Fick
NAIROBI (Reuters) - The soldiers started fanning out in the cashew nut growing regions of southern Tanzania - a jolting sight for traders and, campaigners say, a watershed moment for a country once held up as a darling of development groups. 
The government said the troops were there last week to make sure growers and markets were obeying new orders by President John Magufuli, known to his supporters as ""the bulldozer"". His forceful interventions on everything from commerce to sexual morality have placed him on a collision course with donors.
On Monday, soldiers were out again further north in the tourist hub of Arusha, this time to crack down on street black market currency dealers.
""We as Tanzanians are not accustomed to this ... Since independence, we have not seen the army on the streets like this,"" said lawyer Fatma Karume who has represented opposition lawmakers in a series of lawsuits. 
""There's a climate of fear. To suggest that Magufuli's policies are populist or popular is not understanding the mood among the average person. These policies are not popular, they're authoritarian.""
Magufuli, 59, has said his interventions protect the economy. He appeals to nationalism - railing against foreign interference and telling women not to use birth control because Tanzania needs more people.
""Some countries are now facing declining population growth. They are short on manpower ... I see no reason to control births in Tanzania,"" the president said in a speech in September. 
But donors and investors have looked on with increasing alarm, wondering at the speed of the decline of Tanzania's international standing. They say the economic and social interventions have been accompanied by increasing restrictions on the opposition, the press, even bloggers. 
""Respect for human rights and the rule of law has been repeatedly undermined,"" the EU mission in the country announced last week after saying government pressure had led to the ""forced departure"" of its ambassador. 
Foreign Affairs Minister Augustine Mahiga told Reuters that the government had had a number of unspecified issues with the ambassador, without elaborating.
""TIPPING POINT""
Denmark suspended $10 million in planned aid last week over ""unacceptable homophobic comments"" by the governor of commercial capital Dar es Salaam, after he said a new security squad would start rounding up LGBT people. The foreign ministry later said his statement did not reflect official policy.
""What we are now seeing is a tipping point where (the government) has gone after so many different groups that international donors are saying 'Enough is enough',"" said Nic Cheeseman, Professor of Democracy at Britain's Birmingham University.
""The question is whether donors are going to continue to pull out,"" he said. ""Tanzania is not a country that can survive without this support, even though it has significant natural resources.""
The government has for years received more than a billion dollars annually in foreign grants, putting it among the five biggest aid recipients in Africa, according to the World Bank.
Such grants are expected to account for more than 8 percent of spending, according to this year's budget. 
The government response to criticism has ranged from a defiant defense of its record to quieter retreats on individual disputes.
Mahiga, the minister, dismissed pressure from aid groups as ""intimidation"".
""They are using the words 'You will suffer the consequences'"", the minister told Reuters, declining to name the government he had been speaking to.
""If these are the consequences we are ready to suffer,"" he said. ""We cannot kneel down and be blackmailed, because they have money and we are poor. I think this is not how international behavior should be between neighbors."" 
""DIRECTION OF TRAVEL""
Other responses have been less confrontational. 
The World Bank this month put a planned $300 million loan for an education project on hold, partly in response to a law preventing pregnant girls from returning to school.
World Bank Vice President Hafez Ghanem flew into the country to discuss the issue, then said a cautious agreement had been reached to get the loan process back on track after Tanzania agreed to reconsider the legislation.
It is a world away from Magufuli early days, when he came to power in 2015, and won international praise for his promises to crack down on corruption. 
He courted popularity with surprise visits at government departments, at one point walking into the country's main public hospital and sacking senior managers, saying they were not delivering.
But for Murithi Mutiga of the International Crisis Group, the populist alarm bells were already there. 
""The world has only begun to pay attention to the situation after Magufuli weighed in on social wedge issues that typically attract media coverage, "" he said.

""But the direction of travel in which he was taking Tanzania was clear from the start.""

717,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2018 09:38PM ET</span>",South Korea's surviving 'comfort women' spend final years seeking atonement from Japan,"By Josh Smith and Haejin Choi
DAEGU, South Korea (Reuters) - When 17-year-old Lee Yong-soo returned home to South Korea in 1945 after years as a child sex slave for Japanese troops, her family, having given her up for dead, thought she was a ghost. 
""When I returned, I had a deep wound,"" Lee told Reuters, holding a black and white photo of herself in a traditional Korean dress, taken in her first year back home. 
She still remembers the blue and purple fabric of that dress, but other memories from those years are more traumatic.
""I thought I was going to die,"" Lee said of the abuse and torture she endured at a brothel at an airfield in Taiwan used by Japanese kamikaze pilots in the final years of World War II.
Now 90 years old, Lee says she feels like a sincere apology from Japanese authorities for the wartime exploitation of so-called “comfort women” is no nearer now than when she returned home more than 70 years ago.
Japan says the claims have been settled by past agreements and apologies, and that the continued controversy threatens relations between the two countries.
Some historians estimate up to 200,000 Korean women were forced into sex slavery during Japan's occupation from 1910 to 1945.
Now with only 27 registered South Korean survivors still alive, there is a sense of urgency behind efforts by the women to receive a formal apology as well as legal compensation from Japan while their voices can still be heard.
Just days before Reuters interviewed Lee at her one-room apartment in the southern city of Daegu, a fellow victim had died, one of six so far in 2018.
Another survivor, Kim Bok-dong, said she wanted to share her story, but suffering from cancer and expected to live only a few more months, she was unable to find time to speak. 
""SINCERE APOLOGY""
Under the 1965 treaty, Japan reached a deal with South Korea to provide an $800 million aid and loan package in exchange for Seoul considering all wartime compensation issues settled.
A South Korean panel late last year concluded a separate 2015 deal between South Korea and Japan failed to meet the needs of former ""comfort women"".
Acting on that conclusion, the South Korean government this week shut down a fund created under the 2015 deal and vowed to pursue a more ""victim-oriented"" approach, a move Japan said threatened the two countries' relations.
A sense of shame and secrecy meant most tales of abuse and coercion at Japan's official brothels were never discussed publicly, until Kim Hak-sun, one of the South Korean victims, came forward in 1991.
She and two other former comfort women joined a class action lawsuit against Japan, which prompted the Japanese government to acknowledge its role for the first time. The case was eventually dismissed by Japan's highest courts in 2004. 
Lee was one of the survivors emboldened by Kim's move, and has since worked to raise awareness, including meeting the Pope and travelling to North Korea to meet other victims.
""Since 1992, I had been asking Japan to make sincere apology, that is what I want,"" Lee said. ""I have been doing this for 27 years, it doesn’t matter whether it was raining or snowing, or the weather was cold or hot.""
UNRESOLVED DISPUTE
In the 1990s, Japan created a public-private fund to distribute compensation to ""comfort women"" survivors throughout Asia, which ended in 2007. 
While a number of survivors have accepted compensation over the years, many South Koreans see the issue as unresolved because of what they consider as a lack of sincerity from the Japanese government.
Despite apologies from Japan, for example, the first comfort women fund was criticized in South Korea for not being direct compensation from the state, and the 2015 deal was faulted for failing to include a clear statement of the Japanese government’s legal responsibility.
Japan says South Korea had waived all claims in the 1965 pact, and that under the 2015 deal, Japan agreed to provide the funds to help the women heal ""psychological wounds"".
Shuttering the Japan-funded foundation is one of the most significant steps President Moon Jae-in's administration has taken as it revisits the comfort women controversy.
In the past year, South Korea has also opened a new research centre aimed at consolidating academic study of comfort women, named the first Comfort Women Day and unveiled a new memorial in Cheonan, a city south of Seoul.
""We cannot ignore the truth just because it hurts,"" Moon said this week. ""For the sake of sustainable and solid Korea-Japan relations, we must face up to the truth.” 
Lee said she thinks Moon is ""trying his best,"" and in a statement released from her hospital bed this week, Kim said the move to close the foundation restored her trust in the South Korean president.
Moon's efforts, however, have faced pushback from Japanese officials, including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Earlier this year, Japan formally complained after South Korea’s foreign minister raised the issue in a speech at the United Nations.
Japanese officials have expressed frustration at what they see as the South Korean government's changing positions and efforts to revisit settled agreements. 
For survivors like Lee, Japan's protests ring hollow.

""The survivors of the heinous crimes the Japanese committed are dying day by day, and I bet Abe is dancing for joy,"" Lee said, becoming animated as she described her frustration. ""They should apologise, tell the truth, and pay the legal compensation.""

Last year, the two countries established diplomatic relations after Panama broke off ties with Taiwan. The Dominican Republic and El Salvador followed suit in cutting out Taiwan in favor of China.
Washington has expressed rising concern over the growing influence of China in the region and recalled its top diplomats from the Dominican Republic, El Salvador and Panama in September.
The dispute has turned Central America into a proxy battleground for influence between superpowers for the first time since the United States vied against the Soviet Union in the region during the Cold War.
Xi and Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela will sign about 20 agreements to cooperate in areas such as commerce, technology and infrastructure during the ""unprecedented visit"" on Dec. 2-3, the presidency statement said. 

Panama and China opened free trade talks in July that could turn the Central American country into a hub for Chinese goods across Latin America.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - The first of thousands of Cuban doctors left Brazil on Thursday after criticism by Brazil's far-right President-elect Jair Bolsonaro prompted Cuba's government to sever a cooperation agreement, leaving millions of Brazilians without medical care.
Bolsonaro said the Cuban doctors were being used as ""slave labor"" because the Cuban government took 75 percent of their salaries. He said the program that began in 2013 could only continue if they got full pay and were allowed to bring their families from Cuba.
Bolsonaro, an admirer of U.S. President Donald Trump, was elected last month by Brazilians fed up with rising crime and rampant corruption that reached new highs during almost a decade and a half of leftist governments with close ties to Cuba. 
The Cubans practiced mostly in poor and remote areas of Brazil where Brazilian doctors do not want to work. The government is now scrambling to replace them in 8,332 positions left vacant by the sudden departures of the Cubans.
Cuba has a respected health service and generates major export earnings by sending more than 50,000 health workers to more than 60 countries. Even receiving a fraction of their salaries, the money was good for the doctors by Cuban standards.
As they lined up to check in at the Brasilia airport, many had large mainly 49-inch smart TVs packaged to take home to communist-run Cuba, where such imported sets are very expensive.
""I will be happy to see my children but sad to leave people without medical care,"" said Lume Rodriguez, a general practitioner who spent two years in the interior of Bahia state.
""Our patients came to hug us goodbye,"" said Rafael Sosa, 32, from Granma province in eastern Cuba. ""I visited many patients here who had never had a doctor in their home.""
In many Brazilian towns and the outskirts of cities that relied on the Cuban doctors, usually crowded waiting rooms at public health posts were empty this week and notices said appointments had been canceled until further notice.
Adrielly Rodrigues, a pregnant 22-year-old, was turned away on Wednesday when she went for a pre-natal scan in Santa Maria, a town near the capital Brasilia.
""We are so worried because we don't have the money to pay for a private doctor and she is five months pregnant and still needs to be monitored and have tests,"" said her mother, Adriana Rodrigues.
A national lobby of mayors, the FNP, and the municipal health authorities council Conasems said in a statement that 29 million Brazilians could be left without basic healthcare. They urged the government to make it possible for the Cubans to stay.
Bolsonaro, who takes office on Jan. 1, said last week he would grant asylum to any Cuban who asks for it, escalating tensions with Havana. He said Cuban doctors were not qualified and would have to take exams to practice in Brazil. 
The Health Ministry plans next week to waive a requirement that Cubans validate their medical diploma in Brazil so that they can continue working directly contracted by the Brazilian government and not through the Pan-American Health Organization.
It is not clear how many Cubans will want to break with their communist-run government's doctors-for-export program, which is present in about 60 countries, especially if they have children in Cuba since it would be tantamount to defecting.
Brazil plans to fill the medical vacuum with local hires. In just two days since registration opened, 3.648 Brazilians have been selected to fill the empty posts, a ministry spokesman said, but those replacements are mainly in large urban areas.
One Cuban who will be staying in Brazil is Richel Collazo, who was so liked in the small town of Chapada in southern Brazil that the mayor asked him to become municipal health secretary.

""My town needs doctors and he has been key to our medical care,"" Mayor Carlos Catto said by telephone.

720,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2018 09:10PM ET</span>",China steps up prosecutions for pollution offences: authority,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China prosecuted more than 3,500 people for pollution-related crimes in the first 10 months of the year, up nearly 40 percent on a year ago, law enforcement authorities said, as Beijing looks to courts and police to curb violations. 
China has struggled to enforce its environmental laws as growth-obsessed local governments turn a blind eye to polluting local enterprises, and it has been trying to ensure violations are properly punished.
China's procuratorate said at a Thursday briefing that it would show ""zero tolerance"" to environmental crimes, adding that it also prosecuted nearly 8,500 people for the wider offense of ""damaging resources"" in the first 10 months, up 44 percent.
The number of criminal prosecutions is still small compared to the nearly 130,000 environmental violations reported in the first nine months of the year, leading to fines of 10.63 billion yuan ($1.53 billion), according to environment ministry data.
Beijing has encouraged courts and police departments to establish dedicated environmental divisions, while financial regulators and other government departments are under pressure to play a bigger role in punishing polluters. 
In a speech earlier this year, Chinese President Xi Jinping promised to deploy the full weight of the state to reverse decades of environmental damage, forcing several ministries and regulators to draw up their own plans to fight pollution.
However, the central government still regards grass-roots enforcement as a weak link, and has launched a series of reviews into the way local officials rectify violations, focusing on what they describe as ""fraudulent"", ""superficial"" or ""perfunctory"" efforts to meet pollution standards.
China is also making use of its feared graft-busting body to crack down on local government violations, documents published by the corruption watchdog showed this week.
Anti-corruption teams throughout China have been investigating officials for failing to rectify environmental problems, according to notices published on the website of the Central Commission of Discipline Inspection (CCDI), which normally handles corruption and other acts of misconduct.
At a meeting of the disciplinary body in Xian in northwest China, officials were reprimanded for oversight failures during the construction of a wastewater pipeline, CCDI said in a notice on Thursday.
In another case, the local party discipline committee of Sichuan punished local Communist Party cadres for failing to respond to public complaints about an unregulated dog slaughterhouse in the city of Jianyang, the CCDI said.

TIJUANA (Reuters) - Hundreds of Central American migrants in Mexico massed on Thursday around a tense U.S. border crossing, where security measures held up long lines of Mexicans headed to Thanksgiving gatherings on the other side of the frontier.
With few belongings, and many of them with children in tow, the migrants set out for the crossing from the baseball field in the Mexican border city of Tijuana where they have been camped out. Around 6,000 migrants who have trekked across Mexico in a caravan in recent weeks are now crammed into the field.
They arrived at the Chaparral border crossing, opposite San Diego, California, and said they would wait there until they could request asylum, in spite of growing U.S. measures to tighten the border.
""We are already desperate, last night it rained and we all got wet. There is no room left. We are all sick. My children have a cold ... and nobody has come to give us help,"" said David, a Honduran who only provided his first name.
Earlier on Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he had authorized the use of lethal force on the border and warned that the United States could close the whole frontier.
The San Ysidro vehicular crossing into San Diego, one of the busiest in the world, was briefly shuttered in the afternoon by U.S. officials as they performed a security exercise.
Tens of thousands of Mexicans enter the United States daily to work or study, and many were trying to get to Thanksgiving celebrations. Mariana del Campo, a retired professor, had hoped to make it across before the closing, but was stuck in the line.
""What's happening on the border is maddening,"" she said as she waited in her car. ""I don't know how long we can put up with this. Someone is going to get tired or explode."" 
Also stuck in her car waiting to cross for Thanksgiving was 54-year-old Aurora Diaz, who said her U.S.-based daughter was reluctant to visit Mexico in case Trump closed the border.
U.S. OR BUST
Tensions were palpable at the pedestrian crossing where the Central Americans had gathered. Mexican police and soldiers stood guard while a helicopter buzzed over the U.S side.
Edgar Corzo, an official from Mexico's human rights commission, spoke into a megaphone to the crowd, telling them they could request assistance in Mexico.
But migrants arrived with blankets and prepared to bed down for the night outside the border station. Some of the children cried and complained of the cold.
Authorities in Tijuana said the migrants are facing up to a six-month wait to be able to get an appointment to plead their case for asylum with U.S. authorities.
Earlier this week, U.S. officials briefly closed the main border crossing in Tijuana, putting up concrete barricades and razor wire after reports that migrants could try to rush the crossing.

""I want President Trump to know that we're peaceful people, we don't have weapons, we haven't come to do evil,"" said a man who declined to give his name, holding a white flag on a wooden stick that read ""Peace, God is with us."" ""We want to work, we want them to help us for the love of God,"" he added.

The number of permanent residents reached 21.707 million last year, 22,000 fewer than the previous year, Xinhua said late on Thursday. 
The number of people in the city's six urban districts fell 3 percent from 2016 to 2017, the Xinhua report said, citing the city's People's Congress.
Authorities in Beijing have been making efforts to curb population growth as part of their efforts to ease traffic congestion, resource shortages and house price inflation. 
Beijing's population has risen by two thirds since 1998, while energy consumption has more than doubled and the number of vehicles tripled. It said in 2016 it would take action to cap its population at 23 million by the end of the decade. 
The city has been working on integrating its economy with the neighboring province of Hebei and the city of Tianjin in a bid to allow some of its universities, government departments and industrial firms to move out.
It has also set up a new development zone at Xiongan in Hebei to take on some of Beijing's ""non-capital"" functions, and is also investing heavily on transportation networks in order to make it easier for long-distance commuters.
While big cities like Beijing and Shanghai have sought to control population growth, China as a whole is trying to take action to boost its birth rate, which fell in 2017 and is expected to decline further this year. 
China's elderly population is expected to reach 400 million by the end of 2035, up from around 240 million this year, putting its health services and pension funds under immense strain, according to data published last year by the China Association of Social Security, a research group.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - On a sunny day in a park in Taipei, photographer Austin Haung advises a same-sex couple on how to pose for a pre-wedding photo shoot. For him, Taiwan's reputation as a beacon of liberalism in the region means a thriving business.
""Our clients are mostly same-sex couples from overseas, including Hong Kong, Singapore, China and Malaysia,"" said 32-year-old Haung, who hopes to turn his side job into a full-time business targeting homosexual newlyweds from across the region. 
""They said Taiwan is a reassuring place to do the shoot...If they do this in their own country, they worry about being identified or people raising eyebrows,"" he said. (To see accompanying package, click on https://reut.rs/2Qg9k4Q)
In Asia's first such ruling, Taiwan's constitutional court declared in May last year that same-sex couples had the right to legally marry, and set a two-year deadline for legalization. 
On Saturday, Taiwan will hold a series of public votes on whether its civil law should now recognize same-sex marriage, after its election authority approved contradicting referendum petitions from both conservative and rights groups. 
The issue has divided Taiwan, at family dining room tables, online and on the streets, with large-scale rallies.
Haung, who is gay, plans to vote for same-sex marriage, but his mother Zeng, in her early 60s, staunchly objects. In fact, she has rallied relatives and friends to support the opposing referendum that defines marriage as between a man and a woman.
""There's no need to protect gay marriage. If so, there will be more homosexuals in society,"" she said. ""The younger generation has their own ideas, but I disagree regardless of what they say.""
Rights activists say the conservative referendum is ""discriminatory"" as it goes against a 2017 court ruling that current laws violate the right to freedom of marriage and equality.
The heated debate over whether to legalize same-sex marriage presents a challenge to President Tsai Ing-wen, who rights activists say has backed away from her promise of marriage equality in the run-up to elections in 2016.
The same-sex marriage votes coincides with Taiwan's mayoral and magisterial elections, a test of confidence for Tsai's government grappling with domestic reforms as well as rising pressure from China, which considers the island its own.
""I hope Tsai Ing-wen could undertake the leadership responsibility. The issue has been delayed for so long due to a lack of policy direction from the ruling party,"" said Jennifer Lu, co-ordinator of the Marriage Equality Coalition Taiwan.
""The government should protect the rights of marriage for all Taiwanese.""
Taiwan's capital Taipei has a celebrated annual gay pride parade that showcases the vibrancy of its lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. The one-week celebration in October, largest in the region, contributed more than $3.3 million to the economy, according to daily Taipei Times.
LGBT-related businesses are thriving in Taiwan where liberal attitude has earned it a reputation as Asia's ""gay capital"".
A hub for LGBT rights activists is the Gin Gin bookshop, which was raided by police in 2003 and 500 magazines seized.
""We have fought a long fight and now have loyal customers coming to our shop at least once a year from all over the world,"" said Yang Pingjing, one of the bookshop's owners.
Located in an alley at the heart of Taipei with rainbow flags leading up to the staircases, the owner of a decades-old bathhouse for men said his business is now often packed and receives many customers from overseas.

""I'm not too worried about my business,"" said Yu Nanxian, owner of 24-hour Hans Men's Sauna. ""Once a gay man, you will always be a gay man, no matter the result of the referendum.""

Investigative website Bellingcat has named them as Alexander Yevgenyevich Mishkin and Anatoliy Chepiga, both of whom work for Russia's GRU intelligence services.
Police realized video footage of two men arriving and moving around Salisbury on Sunday March 4, the day the Skripals were found slumped in the center of the English city.

CHICO, Calif. (Reuters) - Hundreds of volunteers and police officers spent the Thanksgiving holiday combing through the wreckage of California's deadliest wildfire, searching for the remains of victims killed in the blaze as rains looked set to complicate their work.
The Camp Fire killed at least 83 people and 563 are still unaccounted for in and around Paradise, a community of nearly 27,000 people that was largely incinerated when the flames swept through two weeks ago, according to authorities.
""We haven't taken the day off,"" Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said in a video message posted online on Thanksgiving. Some 820 searchers were in the field, he said, sifting ash and rubble for human remains.
""This has been a tough situation for all of us,"" Honea said.
Searchers in and around Paradise, 175 miles (280 km) northeast of San Francisco, were expecting heavy rains late on Thursday that could hinder their efforts. Between 4-6 inches (10-15 cm) of rain were forecast to fall by the weekend. 
The rains raise the risk of mudslides in areas where the wildfire stripped hillsides of vegetation that would typically hold down the earth.
After rains helped douse the Camp Fire in recent days, about 900 firefighters were holding the blaze in check, said Scott McLean, a California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman. The fire is now 90-percent contained.
""It's wet and muddy, that's the issue on the fire line,"" McLean said.
Warehouses were opened in Chico, a city a few miles (km) west of Paradise, to provide shelter from the cold and rain to residents who lost their homes. Celebrity chef Jose Andres and other culinary professionals cooked hundreds of Thanksgiving meals for evacuees. 
Firefighters taking a break from the battle against the remnants of the blaze also helped serve Thanksgiving meals.
""Today you see how the best of America is showing up,"" Andres said on CNN, standing in front of tables for evacuees. ""Every man and woman here, they are heroes in their own way because they all go away from their comfort zones to do something for their fellow citizens.""
'HAVEN'T LOST MY HEART' 
The cooking and serving of Thanksgiving meals was led by World Central Kitchen, a charity group founded by Andres. 
By the end of the day, the team expected to have served 10,000 to 15,000 meals to people at several locations in the area including Red Cross shelters, said Sam Chapple-Sokol, a spokesman for the effort. Among the celebrity chefs on hand was television personality Guy Fieri, he said.
Katya Phillips, 33, and her family lost their home in Paradise, but she was among the volunteers on Thursday feeding evacuees at California State University in Chico.
""Not only did I lose my house, I did also lose my car, but I haven't lost my heart so I'm here helping others,"" Phillips said by telephone.
The cause of the Camp Fire, which destroyed more than 13,500 homes, remains under investigation. 
The state is undertaking the largest single wildfire cleanup operation in its history to remove toxic and radioactive ash and debris at burned home sites, officials said.
A separate California wildfire - the Woolsey Fire, which killed three people and threatened the wealthy beachfront enclave of Malibu near Los Angeles - was declared 100-percent contained on Wednesday.
The rains in northern California, which in some areas were likely to be accompanied by winds of up to 45 miles per hour (72 kph), raised risks of ravines turning into rivers of mud. The Camp Fire has burned across 153,336 acres (62,000 hectares) of the Sierra foothills. 
The death toll has been gradually rising, with two more names added to the list on Wednesday to bring the total to 83 people, with 58 of them tentatively identified, authorities said. 
The number of people unaccounted for, which has fluctuated widely over the past week, declined to 563 on Wednesday, falling by more than 300 names.
Asked about the effects of rain on the search for remains, Honea said it would make going through debris more difficult but he was less concerned about remains washing away than the headaches posed by mud.
Still, he said some remains might never be found. 

""What we're looking for in many respects are very small bone fragments so, as we go forward, it's certainly possible that not all of them will be located,"" Honea said.

MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (Reuters) - Militants killed around 100 Nigerian soldiers in an attack on an army base on Sunday, security sources said on Thursday, blaming Islamic State West Africa.
The toll is among the highest since President Muhammadu Buhari came to power in 2015 and it could raise pressure on him ahead of an election in February, not least because he has claimed victory over the nine-year insurgency.
The insurgents attacked the base in the village of Metele in northeastern Borno state, the epicentre of a revolt by Boko Haram and its Islamic State splinter group.
""The insurgents took us unawares,"" said an officer who requested anonymity. ""The base was burned with arms and we lost about 100 soldiers. It is a huge loss.""
Many troops are missing, the sources said. One soldier said more troops were killed on Tuesday when an attempt to recover bodies from the initial attack was ambushed.
""We all flew because we didn't know where the bullets were coming from,"" he said. ""They killed some of us who went to evacuate the bodies of the killed soldiers.""
""We left our amour, tanks and weapons. They were all there. The village is still under their control.""
Four security sources said around 100 died in Metele and the death toll was not final. The fifth said 96 died in the northeast in recent days, mostly in Metele.
The senate, which is controlled by the opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP), on Thursday suspended its session in honour of what it said were 44 dead soldiers after the Metele attack.
Opposition presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar, who is Buhari's main rival, called on the government to support the families of dead soldiers.
A presidency spokesman said the military would issue a statement. Military spokesmen did not respond to requests for comment. The government and military often decline to acknowledge the scale of losses in the northeast.
Militants have killed hundreds of soldiers in the region in recent months.

PALM BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump hinted on Thursday he may visit Afghanistan, scene of one of America's longest wars but a country he has yet to visit almost two years into his presidency.
Delivering a Thanksgiving holiday message by teleconference to troops in Afghanistan, Trump told a U.S. Air Force general he would see him back in the United States, before adding: ""Or maybe I'll even see you over there. You never know what's going to happen.""
Recent U.S. commanders-in-chief have routinely visited troops in active war zones. Trump has come under criticism for failing to do so, though Vice President Mike Pence made a surprise trip to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan last December to visit troops.
By this point in his presidency, former President Barack Obama had made a trip to Iraq and two to Afghanistan. Former President George W. Bush traveled to Afghanistan twice and Iraq four times during his two terms in office.
Trump was criticized when he scrapped a planned visit to a major U.S. military cemetery during a visit to Paris this month because his helicopter was grounded by bad weather during a trip that marked the 100th anniversary of the end of World War One.
Back in Washington on Veterans Day, he failed to visit Arlington National Cemetery, saying later that he was ""extremely bus""” but admitting that he should have.
Asked by a reporter whether he would visit a war zone, Trump said: ""At the appropriate time, we'll be doing some very interesting things.""
He was then asked whether he knew the timing: ""I do, but can't tell you. You're the last people I can tell,"" he told reporters. Presidential trips to war zones are normally cloaked in secrecy for security reasons, revealed only when the commander in chiefs have landed, and sometimes only after they have safely left the region.
Responding to criticism that phoning the troops on Thanksgiving was not enough, Trump defended his actions, arguing that he had hiked spending on the military and veterans.
U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Wednesday was asked by reporters whether he thought Trump should visit troops in war zones.
""The president is the commander in chief and he decides where he needs to go. There are times I don't want him in certain locations to be frank with you, for his security and the troops' security,"" Mattis said.
The United States has some 14,000 troops in Afghanistan, serving in the NATO-led Resolute Support training and advisory mission as well as in separate counter-terrorism operations against militant groups like Islamic State.

U.S. troops arrived in Afghanistan in 2001 as part of the campaign to topple the Taliban following the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States.

The Gulf state said Matthew Hedges had been treated ""fairly"" but also that it wanted an ""amicable solution"" in the case, which has shaken relations between two countries which are old allies.
Hedges, 31, was sentenced on Wednesday on charges of spying for the British government, in a move described as deeply disappointing by Prime Minister Theresa May.
""Matt is innocent,"" Hedges' wife Daniela Tejada told Reuters. ""Handing a life sentence to an innocent researcher who held the UAE in high regard speaks volumes about their lack of tolerance and respect for human life,"" she added.
""They must review their sentence and release my husband, who has already had more than six months taken away from us.""
She later met Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and told reporters afterwards: ""He has assured me that he and his team are doing everything in their power to get Matt free and return him home to me.""
The foreign ministry of the United Arab Emirates said in a statement that Hedges ""has been treated fairly and according to the constitution of the UAE"".
The ministry denied reports that Hedges had not been provided with translators while in detention, saying ""it is not true that he was asked to sign documents he did not understand.""
""KEY ALLY""
The doctoral student at Durham University has been held since May 5, when he was arrested at Dubai International Airport after a two-week research visit.
The evidence presented against him consisted of notes from his dissertation research, his family said.
A life sentence for a non-Emirati entails a maximum of 25 years in jail followed by deportation, according to UAE state-run media.
Hunt has warned the handling of the case by Emirati authorities will have repercussions on relations between the two countries and urged the UAE to reconsider its decision.
He said he had held a contructive conversation on Thursday with his UAE counterpart Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed.
""I believe and trust he's working hard to resolve the situation ASAP (as soon as possible),"" Hunt added on Twitter.
The UAE said both sides were looking for a solution.

""The UAE is determined to protect its important strategic relationship with a key ally,"" its statement said. ""Officials from both countries have discussed the matter regularly over recent months. Both sides hope to find an amicable solution to the Matthew Hedges case.""

SAO PAULO/BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - They call it the greatest rivalry in football and the people who watch it the greatest fans in the world. And this weekend, they are calling the meeting of Argentina's Boca Juniors and River Plate the greatest final ever.
While Europe has the Champions League with money, glamor, and organization, the Copa Libertadores played in South America is all about grit, passion and unpredictability.
Saturday's match between Argentina's two biggest clubs - known as the Superclasico - is almost as much about the fans as the players. The threat of chaos, both on and off the field, is omnipresent. 
The two teams drew the first leg 2-2 at Boca's hallowed Bombonera ground in Buenos Aires on Nov. 11. The decisive second leg takes place this Saturday at River Plate's Monumental stadium on the other side of town.
For the most passionate of followings, it is all or nothing. 
""This is a very important match, we cannot lose,"" said Vicente Zucala, a 29-year old blind fan of River Plate. ""If we lose, we're done, it will all be over.""
Boca have won the Libertadores six times and River have won it three, but this is the first time in the competition's 58-year they have met in the final.
Both matches were sold out, with people coming from all over the world just to soak up the atmosphere. 
""River Plate for me is my life, my passion,"" said Byron Stuardo Alquijay, a 33-year old who came from Guatemala. ""I had to sell my car to come here. I might buy another car in the future but this match will never be repeated.""
Unlike in the past, when rival fans could occupy either end of the stadium praying for a chance to taunt their opponents, only home fans have tickets for the final's two matches. 
Away fans have been banned from Argentine derby matches because of recurring trouble between competing sets of barras bravas, the name given to the organised fan groups who roar their support from the terraces. 
""The Superclasico between Boca and River is so important because the fans are so passionate,"" said Cayetano Milon, a 51-year old Boca fan who runs a shop next to the Bombonera.
That rawness is what appeals to many old-school fans and what makes the Libertadores so different from the Champions League and European football in general. 
FOOTBALL UNREFINED
On the field it is unpredictable - 18 different sides have made it to the last 10 Libertadores finals, compared to just 10 in the Champions League.
Off the field, there is a different level of commitment, even for those used to Kop at Liverpool, the Yellow Wall at Borussia Dortmund, or fireworks and fervour in the Balkans.
Grounds such as La Bombonera are steeped in history, even though many are ramshackle and run down and often lacking proper seats, proper cover and even proper toilets.
Many of the stadiums are part of the community and remain in the same place they were built decades ago, still hemmed in by houses and shops. 
The fans are separated from the players by moats, running tracks or chain-link fences. Sometimes the corners are fitted with perspex to stop drinks and bodily fluids raining down on opposition players.
In the Libertadores, pitches are not always pristine, tackles from behind are common, and it is normal to see the matches end with officials surrounded by riot police, their shields protecting them from fans and players.
The South American Football Confederation wants to make the competition more like the Champions League - a tough task given their prize money is only one-tenth of their European counterparts. 
One of the big changes is to end the home-and-away format for the final and make it a one-off event in a neutral venue. 
The change will take effect next year and has infuriated fans who say the distances and costs involved will rob ordinary supporters of the chance to see their team in the biggest match of the season, and perhaps of their lives.
It also means this Boca-River showdown is the last of its kind. This weekend therefore carries a special poignancy for fans of both teams. 
""Personally, I don't like the River-Boca matches,"" said River fan Maria Fe Diaz, whose father once had a heart attack during a derby match. ""They are too stressful for me. I didn't want this match to happen. I don't know how I'm going to make it until Saturday.""

731,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>",Turkish paper: CIA had recording of Saudi prince demanding Khashoggi be 'silenced',"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A Turkish newspaper reported on Thursday CIA director Gina Haspel signaled to Turkish officials last month that the agency had a recording of a call in which Saudi Arabia's crown prince gave instructions to ""silence"" Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Asked about the report, a Turkish official told Reuters he had no information about such a recording. Saudi Arabia has said Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had no prior knowledge of Khashoggi's killing at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul six weeks ago. 
When asked about the recording by reporters in Florida, U.S. President Donald Trump said, ""I don't want to talk about it. You'll have to ask them."" The CIA declined to comment when asked about the report. 
""There is talk of another recording,"" Hurriyet newspaper journalist Abdulkadir Selvi wrote in a column, saying the purported call took place between Prince Mohammed and his brother, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to Washington.
""It is being said that CIA chief Gina Haspel indicated this during her visit to Turkey,"" he wrote, adding that they had discussed Khashoggi, a critic of the kingdom's de facto ruler.
""It is being said the crown prince gave orders to 'silence Jamal Khashoggi as soon as possible',"" in a call which was monitored by the U.S. agency, he said.
Khashoggi was killed at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 in an operation that Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan has said was ordered by the highest level of Saudi leadership.
After offering numerous contradictory explanations, Riyadh said last week Khashoggi had been killed and his body dismembered when negotiations to persuade him to return to Saudi Arabia failed.
Trump said the CIA had not definitively concluded that the crown prince was responsible, and said he would stand by Saudi Arabia’s leadership because it was a key U.S. ally.
“We want low oil prices and Saudi Arabia has really done a good job in that respect,” Trump said.
""I hate the crime. I hate what's done. I hate the cover up. And I tell you what: the crown prince hates it more than I do,"" Trump said, without providing further detail.

733,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2018 12:13PM ET</span>",Italy's 5-Star struggles to keep up with soaring Salvini,"By Crispian Balmer
ROME (Reuters) - The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement emerged as Italy's predominant political force at March elections, allowing it to enter government for the first time in its short history and take many top ministerial jobs.
Five months later, it is discovering that governing is considerably more difficult than being in opposition.
While its coalition partner the League has overtaken it in opinion polls, driven forward by its media-savvy leader Matteo Salvini, 5-Star has seen its own support slip.
Led by Luigi Di Maio, the party has already had to jettison some campaign pledges, has seen high-profile ministers make gaffe-prone cabinet debuts and has struggled to corral its disparate bloc of parliamentarians.
The worries facing 5-Star, coupled with Salvini's surging popularity, are certain to embolden the far-right League as it pursues its anti-immigrant, Italy-first agenda, confident that if the coalition fell apart it would triumph in a snap election.
The setbacks afflicting 5-Star show the problems facing unconventional, populist parties that are sprouting up across Europe as they evolve from raucous protest movements into mature rulers. 
But the initial reversals are also likely to harden 5-Star resolve in the government's showdown with the European Union over next year's budget as it seeks to show its voters that it has not lost its radical zeal.
""Salvini has the wind in his sails and the 5-Star doesn't any more,"" said Sergio Fabbrini, head of the political science department at Rome's LUISS university. 
""The 5-Star based its electoral success on promises that are proving very hard to fulfil and you can see that it is struggling to stay true to itself,"" he added.
Di Maio, 32, denies his party is in any difficulty and insists it has scored early successes, including curbing parliamentary privileges and bolstering workers' rights.
He has accused the press of being prejudiced against 5-Star, denouncing journalists as ""foul jackals"", and alleging that newspapers are intent on stirring trouble between himself and his fellow deputy prime minister, Salvini.
""This government enjoys a great consensus in the country and the other parties are trailing far behind us,"" he told a group of foreign journalists earlier this month. 
MEDIA MASTERY
But the polls are more comforting for Salvini than Di Maio.
While the League won 17 percent of the vote in March against 32 percent for 5-Star, a Nov. 19 survey put Salvini's party on 32.7 percent against 26.4 percent for 5-Star - a reverse that pollsters SWG said should sound a ""red alarm"" for Di Maio.
Daniela Aiuto, a European parliamentarian who last month quit 5-Star after a disagreement with its leadership, says Salvini's success is based on his mastery of social media as he pursues his hardline crackdown on immigration.
""Luigi (Di Maio) has ability, but the comparison with Salvini is sadly one-sided,"" she told Reuters. ""What Luigi says might be important, but what Salvini says makes headlines.""
Insiders say the two coalition leaders get on relatively well, speaking to each other every day and regularly exchanging messages via WhatsApp. But relationships between the two parties' ministers, lawmakers and experts are much more fraught.
While the League has years of experience of government, at a national and local level, 5-Star was only formed in 2009 and has much less administrative know-how. League lawmakers such as Igor Iezzi say this inexperience can be seen in parliament.
""They must learn to work in a coalition. We are not on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), where you read the posts and then change your mind,"" Iezzi told Reuters, complaining that 5-Star counterparts were chopping and changing their ideas on amendments.
""If you work 10 days on an amendment, you cannot then go back on it ... You need to grow up a bit,"" he said.
DISCIPLINE
Salvini has found it easier to marshal his parliamentary forces than Di Maio, who is trying to enforce order by threatening to expel anyone who votes down coalition proposals.
One such dissenter is Gregorio De Falco, a former coastguard commander viewed as a hero in Italy for his role in rescuing survivors from the stricken Costa Concordia cruise ship in 2012.
His decision to stand as a 5-Star candidate in the March ballot was seen as a coup for the party, but he has now voted against the government three times in less than a month, most recently in opposition to a proposed amnesty on illegal building on the earthquake-hit island of Ischia.
""5-Star was born as an environmental group and we cannot forget this now we are in government,"" De Falco told Reuters.
The party has already disappointed its environmentalist wing by reneging on a campaign pledge to halt the construction of the TAP gas pipeline project in the Puglia region.
It explained the U-turn by saying Italy could have been hit by fines of 20 billion euro ($23 billion) if it had killed the project and denied knowing this before taking office. 
Likewise, it infuriated some supporters by letting steel giant ArcelorMittal buy Italy's troubled Ilva steelmaker rather than follow through on promises to shut down the firm's heavily polluting Puglia furnaces.
These decisions dictated by realpolitik have put 5-Star on the defensive and made it determined not to cede ground in other battles - most notably over its flagship policy, the so-called ""citizen's wage"", an income support plan for the poor.
The proposal helped 5-Star win up to 50 percent of the vote in the underdeveloped south and Di Maio insists it must be introduced it next year at a cost of around 10 billion euros.
The League, which draws much support from the wealthy north and is ideologically opposed to major welfare handouts, has agreed to the plan in principle, but warns its implementation will be ""complicated"".
""This is creating permanent tensions with the League, but it would be a disaster for 5-Star if the plan fails so they will do everything possible to prevent that happening."" said Luiss University professor Fabbrini.
When it comes to trying to impose its will on its coalition partner, 5-Star has one important handicap.
In a country that has seen some 65 governments since World War Two, coalition parties have regularly threatened to walk out of administrations if they don't get what they want. But such threats from the 5-Star would ring hollow. 
Under party rules, its lawmakers can only serve two mandates, which means Di Maio and most top party officials will not be allowed to stand at the next election. Analysts believe this means they will do everything they can to cling to office.

""Di Maio has every interest in keeping the government going, even though it cannot give him everything he needs. This puts him at a distinct disadvantage to Salvini,"" said Fabbrini.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The Anne Frank House Museum, built around the secret apartment where the Jewish teenager and her family hid from the Nazis, has reopened after being renovated to receive a new generation of visitors whose grandparents were born after World War II.
The museum and tiny apartment where Anne wrote her diary -- which has become the most widely-read document to emerge from the Holocaust -- attract 1.2 million visitors annually. 
Anne's story is told through simple photos, quotes from her diary and video testimony of survivors. Curators have now added an audio tour. 
""We sometimes say that the Anne Frank House Museum is one of the only museums in the world that doesn't have much more to offer than empty spaces,"" said museum director Ronald Leopold.
""An audio tour gave us the ability to give information without disturbing what I think is one of the most powerful elements of this house: its emptiness.""
A trip through the museum, which was reopened by Dutch King Willem-Alexander on Thursday, begins with the history of the Frank family, their flight to the Netherlands after Hitler's rise to power in Germany and their decision to go into hiding on July 6, 1942.
Visitors pass through the swinging bookcase that concealed the cramped secret annex above a warehouse where Anne, her sister Margot, her father Otto, mother Edith and four other Jews hid until they were arrested by German police on August 4, 1944. 
The museum then displays the government document registering the Franks' deportation on a cattle car train to Auschwitz. 
Anne was later transferred to the concentration camp at Bergen-Belsen, where she died in early 1945 aged 15, one of the six million Jews who lost their life under the Nazi regime.
Of those that hid in the secret apartment, only Otto survived the war. He was given Anne's diary, which had been preserved by Miep Gies, a member of the tight circle of Dutch friends that helped the Jews in hiding.
In a film clip, Otto describes reading the diary after a period of grieving.
""I must say I was very much surprised about the deep thoughts there she had; her seriousness, especially her self-criticism. It was quite a different Anne I had known as my daughter,"" he said.
""My conclusion is, as I had been on very, very good terms with her, that most parents don't know -- don't know really -- their own children.""

The museum concludes with a simple room where the original red-and-white bound diary -- which outgrew its covers -- and several additional pages are on display. Photographs are not allowed due to the fragility of the pages.

The foreign ministry did not name the individuals but said in a statement that the move was in coordination with European partners, notably Germany. Berlin on Monday also banned 18 Saudis and moved to halt all arms sales to Saudi Arabia.
The bans bind all members of the European Union's passport-free Schengen zone, it said.
""The murder of Mr Khashoggi is a crime of extreme gravity, which moreover goes against freedom of the press and the most fundamental rights,"" the ministry statement said.
France expected a transparent, detailed and exhaustive response from Saudi authorities, it said. 
""These are interim measures that may be reviewed or extended depending on the progress of ongoing investigations,"" it said.
French reaction has been relatively guarded given it is keen to retain its influence with Riyadh and protect commercial relations spanning energy, finance and weapons sales.
Saudi's deputy public prosecutor said on Nov. 15 that Riyadh was seeking the death penalty for five of the 11 suspects charged with Khashoggi's killing at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month.
""It (France) recalls its opposition, in all places and in all circumstances, to the death penalty,"" the ministry said.

The state security prosecutor ordered Aisha al-Shater and the other five to be held for 15 days pending an investigation on charges including membership in a terrorist organization, state news agency MENA said.
Human Rights Watch said on Sunday that Egyptian police and security forces had conducted a mass arrest campaign, rounding up at least 40 political activists, lawyers and human rights workers since late October.
Security forces carrying out the arrests presented no warrants, and families were not told where the detainees were being held, the New York-based rights watchdog said.
Among the others whose detentions were revealed on Thursday along with Shater was Hoda Abd al-Moneim, a 60-year-old lawyer and Brotherhood member. Her family said in a statement they saw her early on Thursday at the state security prosecution office ""after 21 days of enforced disappearance by the Egyptian authorities"".
Her daughters were ""shocked to find that Hoda, a 60-year old mother and grandmother, was in a dire health condition with clear signs of weight loss, psychological trauma, severe signs of instability and shock,"" the statement said. ""She couldn't give a reason for her condition to her family members.""
The interior ministry was not immediately available to comment.
Abd al-Moneim's daughter Gihad Badawy told Reuters earlier this month that security forces took her mother away without presenting an arrest warrant, and that the family had no idea where she was being held.
The lawyer had previously had a blood clot in her leg but was not allowed to bring her medicine with her when she was detained.
The six people will now be held in custody for the next 15 days. After that, they could either be held longer or released. 
The Brotherhood, a decades-old Islamist political movement with a mass following, won the first free elections after the 2011 uprising that ended autocrat Hosni Mubarak’s 30-year rule, but was toppled by the army after a year in power.
Since then, the group has been banned and hundreds of its followers have been jailed. The Brotherhood says it is a non-violent movement and denies any relationship to violent insurgencies waged by al Qaeda and Islamic State militants.
President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's supporters say a government crackdown on his opponents aims to keep Egypt stable after years of political and economic turmoil following the 2011 revolt.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Francis Montano sits on a cold pavement with her three children, all their worldly possessions stuffed into plastic bags, as she pleads to be let into a new camp for Venezuelan migrants in the Colombian capital, Bogota.
Behind Montano, smoke snakes from woodfires set amid the bright yellow tents which are now home to hundreds of Venezuelans, erected on a former soccer pitch in a middle-class residential area in the west of the city.
The penniless migrants, some of the millions who have fled Venezuela's economic and social crisis, have been here more than a week, forced by city authorities to vacate a makeshift slum of plastic tarps a few miles away.
The tent city is the first of its kind in Bogota. While authorities have established camps at the Venezuelan border, they have resisted doing so in Colombia's interior, wary of encouraging migrants to settle instead of moving to neighboring countries or returning home.
Its gates are guarded by police and officials from the mayor's office and only those registered from the old slum are allowed access.
""We'll have to sleep on the street again, under a bridge,"" said Montano, 22, whose children are all under seven years old. ""I just want a roof for my kids at night."" 
According to the United Nations, an estimated 3 million Venezuelans have fled as their oil-rich country has sunk into crisis under President Nicolas Maduro. Critics accuse the Socialist leader of ravaging the economy through state interventions while clamping down on political opponents.
The exodus - driven by violence, hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicines - amounts to one in 12 of the population, placing strain on neighboring countries, already struggling with poverty. 
Colombia, which has borne the brunt of the migration crisis, estimates it is sheltering 1 million Venezuelans, with some 3,000 arriving daily. The government says their total numbers could swell to 4 million by 2021, costing it nearly $9 billion a year.
Municipal authorities in Bogota say the camp will provide shelter for 422 migrants through Christmas. Then in mid January, it will be dismantled in the hope jobs and new lodgings have been found.
For most, that is unlikely. Residents say they cannot find permanent work, so scrape together a few pesos selling candies at traffic lights.
Donations of food and clothing are banned because officials do not want migrants to get accustomed to handouts as they did in the makeshift camp.
""Kind-hearted Bogotanos brought food, blankets and emergency supplies, so they didn't leave,"" said social director of the mayor's office, Liliana Pulido, adamant the tent city is temporary.
""There are no more camps."" 
Once the tent city closes in January, those without jobs and lodgings will simply return to the streets, they say.
""We're not asking for handouts, just work,"" said Carmen Castillo, 29, who shares a tent with five others after traveling 550 km (342 miles) from the border town of Cucuta with her husband and baby son three months ago. 
REQUEST FOR AID 
Colombian President Ivan Duque has asked for international aid to help shoulder the humanitarian crisis, including funding for vaccinations, schooling, water sanitation and housing.
The United States and European Union have sent tens of millions of dollars but Colombia, which is struggling to recover after a 2016 peace deal ended five decades of conflict with the Marxist FARC rebels, says much more is required. 
And while most Colombians are sympathetic to the Venezuelans' plight, xenophobia has increased, especially in border areas. In Bogota, many residents complain about being asked for money and stepping over Venezuelans sleeping rough. 
Migrants say they have been attacked and spat on. 
""Colombians need to be more human, walk in our shoes,"" said Castillo. 
Although a vast improvement on the filthy shanty dwellings that lined railway tracks near Bogota's bus terminal, migrants complain the tent facilities are not adequate. 
The walled camp has just four shower units and 10 toilets for 65 tents. Migrants grumble they only get sandwiches, apples and fruit juice while frequent rain floods into their tents. 
Scuffles broke out this week over food and 16 residents were expelled from the camp. 
""There are sick people here ... Children are underweight,"" said Agustin Perez, 52 whose tent houses seven family members and is draped with drying clothes. ""It's humiliating.""

His wife, Esnedith Arroyo, 58, disagreed and said she is happy. Conditions and security are much better even without provisions.

“During attacks by the Israelis, we want to get our message out there. But we have to be mindful of what our group is experiencing – the stress, anxiety. We can’t always do it,” she said.
On the Israeli side, the Instagram account Otef Gaza, which means ""Gaza Periphery"" in Hebrew, was started by a group of teenage girls in and around Kerem Shalom, a kibbutz beside the border.
The group highlights photographs of farmland scorched by incendiary devices flown into Israel during Palestinian border protests, and rockets fired by Gaza militants which send Israelis running to shelters.
""People are not aware that this is our reality, and they simply ignore us,"" said Lee Cohen, 17, who co-manages the account.
“You can’t sleep because of the rocket sirens, the explosions, helicopters flying overhead and the fear of terrorists from Gaza coming in through a tunnel and trying to kill people.”
HUMAN PROBLEMS
Inside the Gaza Strip, 225 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since border protests began on March 30, according to Palestinian health officials.
Israel says that many of those killed were militants, and that its troops are defending the border. One Israeli soldier has been killed during the protests, when he was hit by Hamas gunfire.
In Gaza City 27-year-old Alzraiy said the purpose of ""We Are Not Numbers"" was “to speak of the human problems” of Gaza. 
“You get used to the feeling that at any moment, something could happen,” she said. “It’s like just for a second, you could lose your value as a human being.”
Another Gazan, Fatma Abu Musabbeh, 22, takes another approach. She insists on showing only positive images, so her account features manicured gardens and stonecraft buildings.
""When there is a war or difficult situation, I post a photo or two to tell my followers and the world that Gaza is beautiful, despite what is happening,"" said Abu Musabbeh.
Across the border one of the Israeli Instagrammers, Meshy Elmkies, 16, said they use the app because it is easy to organize information, “and I personally think that teenagers have the power to make an impact.”
During a phone call with Reuters last week, the voice of her friend, Lee Cohen, suddenly became hushed.

""There's a red alert siren,"" she muttered. “Can we speak later?”

Israel's military censor, without commenting on the credibility of Hamas's information, urged the media not to disseminate any details about the Nov. 11 incident in which an Israeli colonel, a Hamas commander and six other Palestinian militants were killed. 
Israel has not released the name of the dead Israeli officer, citing security considerations, and has not commented on the purpose of the undercover mission that Hamas said it interrupted when its men challenged a civilian vehicle.
The incident led to a two-day flare-up of rocket attacks from Gaza and Israeli air strikes. 
A photo array of what Hamas described as ""fugitives"" appeared without names on the website of its armed wing, the Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades. The two women pictured were wearing traditional Muslim head scarves. 
The website listed phone numbers for people to call or text with any information about the suspects. 
Israel's military censor said Hamas was trying to decipher and understand ""the event that took place deep in Gaza"" and urged the Israeli media not to disseminate pictures or ""personal identifying details"" gleaned from the media or the internet.
""Every piece of information, even if it is considered harmless by those publishing it, is liable to endanger human lives and cause harm to the country's security,"" it said.
Israeli law mandates that local and foreign media submit stories dealing with national security or the military to the censor before publication. In reality, reports on routine military activity are rarely submitted, and the censor is largely powerless to block social media posts.

ROME (Reuters) - Iraq plans to launch a reconstruction agency to focus on projects such as a deep water port and a rail network, Iraq's president said on Thursday, as the country seeks to put years of turmoil behind it.
Over the past year Iraq has emerged from a devastating conflict with hardline militants who seized almost a third of the country.
It declared victory in December 2017 over the Islamic State armed group, having taken back all the territory captured by the ultra hardline militants in 2014 and 2015. 
Barham Salih told an international conference in Rome that defeating Daesh, an acronym for the Islamic state, was ""a monumental challenge and an immense success for Iraqi army forces."" 
Iraq plans to work with foreign entities, including sovereign wealth funds, on several infrastructure projects, Salih said, but he pointed to corruption and abuse of public funds as problems that undermine reconstruction efforts.
""Iraqi and foreign private sector companies as well as international financial institutions, donor countries and sovereign wealth funds, will be invited to invest in these (infrastructure) projects"", Salih said.
The Iraqi parliament elected Barham Salih, a Kurdish politician, in October. The presidency in Iraq is largely a ceremonial position, but the vote for Salih was an important step toward forming a new government.
Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said on Wednesday he would go to parliament next week to get his full cabinet approved.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The German defense ministry expects to announce next steps by the end of the year in its drive to replace 85 aging Tornado fighter jets that will cost billions of euros.
""There will be a decision this year,"" a ministry spokesman said, citing a pledge in July by Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen to move ahead with the program in 2018. The spokesman gave no further details on what the decision would entail.
Sources familiar with the process said the ministry was likely to narrow the field of potential replacement jets from four to two -- the Eurofighter Typhoon built by Airbus, Britain's BAE Systems (LON:BAES) and Italy's Leonardo SpA and most likely, the  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) F-35. 
Von der Leyen favors a European solution, but the ministry also reviewed data submitted by the U.S. government on the F-35, and the F-15 and F/A-18E/F jets, both built by Boeing (NYSE:BA).
Several options were on the table, including buying one type of jet to replace the Tornado jets, a split buy of two aircraft types, and extending the life of the Tornados.
However the ministry in August asked potential bidders if they could deliver new warplanes before the initial target date of 2025, a move sources said reflected growing concerns about the cost of keeping the Tornados flying longer.
NUCLEAR CAPABILITY
A key factor will be the ability of the new jets to carry and deliver nuclear bombs. Germany is not a nuclear power, but hosts some U.S. nuclear warheads under NATO's nuclear-sharing policy and operates a number of Tornados that can deliver them.
One proposal calls for Germany to buy 45 Lockheed F-35 jets to replace those Tornados, and about 75 new Eurofighters to replace both the other Tornados and a first batch of Eurofighters delivered between 2003 and 2008, sources said.
Buying F-35s would allow Germany to keep a mixed fleet of fighter jets, a requirement in its military strategy, while averting costly modifications to the Eurofighter.
Two of the sources said Germany had not yet commissioned a mandatory U.S. study of the certification issue, which could take 12 to 18 months to complete. Achieving certification for the Eurofighter could ultimately cost over 700 million euros and take well over seven years, they added.

The two mini-vans, fitted with what is described as a non-lethal system, cost a total of 65.2 million roubles ($995,250) according to a public procurement order posted online which indicated they had been delivered in October. 
Rosgvardiya, Russia's National Guard, confirmed the purchases in a statement on Wednesday, but said it was wrong to call the new systems a weapon and that they were intended to be used to provide acoustic and other interference during counter-terrorism operations. 
Alongside regular police, National Guard officers use batons to break up anti-Kremlin rallies and have detained hundreds of protesters at nationwide protests led by opposition leader Alexei Navalny in the past year.
""If necessary they could use something like this against crowds in the street,"" said Lyubov Sobol, a Navalny ally, who listed a number of other hi-tech crowd control vehicles at the authorities' disposal.
""I want to advise our government officials,"" Sobol said in an online video. ""Learn not to ban demonstrations and frighten people with special vehicles and talk to people...and listen to what is being said.""

As the army closed off streets for its ceremony, protesters angry at worsening living conditions marched through Beirut under the slogan: ""Our independence from your exploitation"". 
More than six months since a parliamentary election, Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri has hit a wall in trying to form a national unity government that is urgently needed to reform the budget and manage the country's huge debt burden.
""The economic situation is on the floor, there's no state, no government ... Once there's a state, we will celebrate independence,"" said Beirut worker Suzanne Awada.
Around 200 people joined the protest but while the turnout was small, the complaints on their banners are daily topics of conversation across the country: corruption, bad water and power supplies, unemployment, pollution, poor education and housing, the national debt and political infighting.
""We want to say to the country's ruling mafia that it is responsible for the political, economic, social and environmental deterioration we are experiencing,"" protest co-organizers You Stink said in an online statement.
Lebanon has the world's third largest public debt as a proportion of its economy and low growth, although the central bank says the Lebanese pound's peg to the dollar is stable. The country is also hosting more than a million refugees from the war in neighboring Syria.
A new government committed to reform would unlock more than $11 billion worth of donor investment for infrastructure needing repair since a 15-year civil war ended in 1990.
""BROKEN DREAMS""
Lebanon is no stranger to political paralysis and governments often take months to form, but the economic pressures are making the mood tense. 
""It's a state of thieves. Throw them in the sea,"" 48-year-old Abu Ali said on Beirut's Corniche. The waterfront promenade is one of the crowded capital's few public spaces, but the smell of sewage and garbage floating on greasy waves are emblematic of many of the government's failures.
President Michel Aoun acknowledged citizens' frustration in an address marking the anniversary of independence in 1943 from French rule. 
""The Lebanese people (are) sick of promises, have almost despaired of grasping interests, are tired of the indifference of decision-makers to their concerns, their unemployment, their rights and their broken dreams,"" he said on Wednesday.
Aoun said the country no longer had the luxury of wasting time on government formation and called on officials and parties to set aside their interests and work for the Lebanese people. 
IMPASSE 
However, Aoun offered no solution of his own to break the impasse. The current obstacle surrounds Sunni Muslim representation in the cabinet, where the 30 seats must be allocated along sectarian lines.
Hezbollah, an armed Shi'ite group backed by Iran, wants one of six Sunni lawmakers allied to it to get a cabinet job. Hariri has refused to give up one of the seats allocated for his mainly Sunni party, and no other major grouping has offered one either. 
Foreign states have often regarded tiny Lebanon as a theater for their rivalry, exploiting the fissures between Muslim and Christian sects who have also courted outside intervention to help them in their struggles with each other.
Many are left wondering how independent Lebanon really is. 

""In other countries people are proud of their independence from colonialism or other outside ties. In this country we are still tied to those outside - whether we want it or not,"" said protestor Elham Moubarak.

Thousands of cars have piled up at the port and at the Volkswagen Autoeuropa plant since the strike began on Nov. 5, forcing the manufacturer to cancel seven shipments. 
Stevedores tore down the fences around the main access road to the port and sat and lay in front of a bus with strikebreakers before police hauled them away one by one, while others shouted ""Go away, go away!"".
Stevedores' union SEAL accuses the port authorities of a ""criminal wage discrimination"" against the majority of stevedores who have no permanent contracts and are usually hired for a day's job.
Volkswagen Autoeuropa said in a statement the ship's loading on Thursday was made possible thanks to guarantees provided by the government and the port operator. It said no alternative shipping route was capable of handling its production volume.
The plant makes more than 880 cars per day, including the new T-Roc SUV. Autoeuropa is Portugal's single largest exporter.
The union said 30 strikebreakers had been hired specifically by the car manufacturer to load the ship with some 2,000 Volkswagen cars that had been piling up at the port, and were paid far more than workers usually were.
Volkswagen would not comment on the hiring of strikebreakers.

Sherpa, which previously filed a claim against Vinci that was dismissed by French prosecutors in February, said it had lodged a fresh complaint against the company in France, with new witness statements on alleged abuses. 
In a statement, Vinci, which is still pursuing Sherpa for libel over its previous complaint from 2015, said it ""refuted, back then and now, all the allegations made by Sherpa"".
Vinci, which counts the wealthy Arab state as its second-biggest shareholder, has several major projects in Qatar linked to the soccer tournament, including a metro line in Doha and a highway. 
The French company denied that some migrant workers had seen their passports confiscated and said employees could access their documents stored in safes at any time. 
It also said that no serious accidents had been recorded at its construction sites due to high temperatures, and that it had doctors on hand. Sherpa said witnesses had described workers vomiting and suffering from weakness in excessive heat. 
""Vinci has always worked towards improving working conditions in Qatar,"" the group said.
Qatar has faced several allegations of migrant worker abuse and, under increased scrutiny as it prepares to host the 2022 World Cup, the kingdom has put in place a series of safeguards for workers over the past year. 
Sherpa said it was lodging its complaint against Vinci in France together with another non-governmental organisation CCEM (Committee against modern slavery) and six former Vinci workers from India and Nepal. 
The allegations are leveled at Vinci's Construction Grand Projets division as well as its QDVC unit, which is 51 percent owned by Qatari Diar, the property arm of Qatar's sovereign wealth fund. 
Sherpa said it had gathered new testimonies and elements this year in India, where some of the migrant workers originated from. 
It accuses the groups and their managers of deliberately endangering people's lives, forced labor and a failure to provide first aid assistance to workers. 
It also alleges employees had to work between 66 and 77 hours a week, on wages that were a fraction of average salaries in Qatar, and were housed in cramped conditions, violating international labor standards.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's MI5 security service missed potential opportunities to prevent a 2017 suicide bombing at a pop concert that killed 22 people, senior lawmakers said in a report on Thursday, adding that the government had failed to learn from previous attacks.
Britain suffered four attacks last year that killed 36 people, the most deadly of which occurred at the end of an Ariana Grande show in Manchester, northern England, in May.
In a report, parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) said there had been a number of failures by MI5 over the Manchester bomber, 22-year-old Briton Salman Abedi.
""While it is impossible to say whether these would have prevented the devastating attack on May 22, we have concluded that, as a result of the failings, potential opportunities to prevent it were missed,"" said Dominic Grieve, the committee chairman.
Britain is currently on its second-highest threat level of severe, meaning an attack is considered highly likely and security officials say they are facing record levels of work in countering Islamist militants as well as far-right extremists. 
Whilst acknowledging their heavy workload and many other successes, the ISC said MI5 had made mistakes over Abedi who had been known to the security agency since 2014.
He visited a jailed miliant in prison but no follow-up action was taken by police or MI5. Shortly before he carried out the bombing his case had been flagged for review, but ""as MI5 put it, 'the plot then moved faster than the process,'"" the report said. 
He was never referred to a counter-extremism program and MI5 also did not restrict his travel, allowing him to return to Britain undetected in the days before he carried out the attack.
""MI5 have admitted that, given the information they had on Abedi, they should have done so,"" Grieve said. He added there was another issue which caused great concern but could not be publicly commented on because it would cause ""serious damage"" to national security.
PREVIOUS RECOMMENDATIONS UNHEEDED
Grieve said it was striking how many issues had been previously raised in ISC reports on other attacks, including the July 2005 London public transport bombings which killed 52 people.
""We previously made recommendations in all of these areas yet the government failed to act,"" he said. 
MI5 actively monitors 3,000 ""subjects of interest"" (SOI) while there were another 20,000 who have been investigated and had their case closed because there was no intelligence to show involvement in attack planning. Abedi had been a ""closed SOI""
""Following the attacks, the government, police and MI5 undertook a series of rigorous reviews to ensure we are all doing everything we can to tackle the evolving threat of terrorism,"" Home Secretary (interior minister) Sajid Javid said.
Britain's top counter-terrorism police officer said the authorities had thwarted 13 other plots since March 2017.

LONDON (Reuters) - Libya's sovereign wealth fund will appoint auditors within weeks and conclude a wide-ranging examination of its assets by 2019 as part of its efforts to get billions of dollars of assets unfrozen, the fund's head told Reuters. 
Ali Mahmoud Hassan Mohamed, the chairman and chief executive of the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA), said financial auditing and consulting company PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was one of the firms the fund was considering. 
About 70 percent of the LIA's $67 billion worth of assets have been frozen under United Nations sanctions since the toppling of veteran ruler Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 pushed the country into turmoil. 
UN diplomats say they want to see a stable government in Libya before relaxing the sanctions.
""We want to strengthen the trust of the international community in the Libyan Investment Authority. We are cooperating with the United Nations and adhering to their sanctions,"" Mohamed said in an interview in London.
""We are making reforms from top to bottom and carrying out an audit that can be used by the UN to check the assets of the LIA,"" he said, speaking through a translator.
Libya's economy has collapsed, and the fund could eventually be an important source of finance for the war-torn country. But it has long been hampered by a leadership dispute between rival factions in Tripoli and eastern Libya. Mohamed said he had ended some of those divisions by merging departments and offices. 
""We need to enhance our governance. Political splits damaged the Libyan Investment Authority. Our assets were frozen in order to protect them,"" he said.
Asked about reports on funds that had been transferred out of European bank accounts linked to LIA, Mohammed said that stemmed from dividends and interest paid on holdings of equities and fixed income instruments. The asset freeze only applied to the equity itself or the principal of the bonds, he said. 
""These revenues from equity dividends are worth hundreds of millions every year. We have received those since 2011,"" he said, adding more than $1 billion had been transferred to LIA's accounts at Arab Bank Corporation (ABC) in Bahrain from custodian bank accounts in Belgium and Luxembourg since 2011. 
""Money withdrawn from ABC bank was used to pay for the operational costs of the LIA. We have statements dating back to 2011,"" he said, adding he had full control over the accounts and no money had disappeared. 
Around $8.5 billion of LIA's assets were invested in global equities and some $1.5 billion in bonds, according to Mohamed. 
Mohamed also said all the fund's Tripoli-based staff had now moved out of the Tripoli Tower office block to a different, undisclosed location in the city, amid security breaches that saw a number of employees threatened or abducted by militias. 
Tripoli is largely controlled by a handful of powerful armed groups claiming official status that have expanded their economic interests, penetrated key institutions and frequently abducted rivals with impunity. LIA said it employs 140 people directly though more than 1000 including its subsidiaries.

President Donald Trump said in May he was pulling the United States out of the 2015 nuclear deal for reasons including Iran's influence on the wars in Syria and Yemen and its ballistic missile program, none of which are covered by the pact.
Germany, France and Britain have been scrambling to prevent a collapse of the deal, under which international sanctions against Tehran were lifted in exchange for strict limits being placed on Iran's nuclear activities. 
Many Western companies have canceled plans to do business with Iran for fear of breaching the sanctions Washington has put back in place. That has raised fears that Iran will breach the deal's nuclear limits, which are designed to keep it a year away from being able to build a nuclear weapon if it chose to.
""Iran is implementing its nuclear-related commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action,"" International Atomic Energy Agency Director-General Yukiya Amano told a quarterly meeting of his agency's 35-nation Board of Governors.
The JCPOA is the official name of the nuclear accord. 
""It is essential that Iran continues to fully implement those commitments,"" he added, confirming the findings of a confidential report to IAEA member states last week.
Amano did not comment on the broader impact of U.S. sanctions, the latest round of which took effect on Nov. 5. Iran has warned it could scrap the deal if signatories France, Britain and Germany and their allies fail to preserve the economic benefits promised by its terms.
The European powers have been working on setting up a so-called special-purpose vehicle that would act as a kind of clearing house matching Iranian exports with EU exports in what amounts to a barter arrangement to circumvent U.S. sanctions.

But the countries they have approached to host it have declined, diplomats say, delaying the project and deepening doubt as to whether Europeans can counteract the bulk of U.S. sanctions targeting oil and other vital sources of income.

Muslim-majority Pakistan has also decided to open the corridor on its side of the border and Prime Minister Imran Khan will lay the foundation stone this month, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said in a Tweet. 
Many Sikhs see Pakistan as the place where their religion began: the founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak, was born in 1469 in a small village near the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore.
""Government of Pakistan will be urged to recognize the sentiments of the Sikh community and to develop a corridor with suitable facilities in their territory as well,"" the Indian government said in a statement.

Thousands of Sikhs already visit the shrine in Pakistan every year. But the new road has stoked fears among some security experts that it could be used by Pakistan and foreign-based Sikh separatists to campaign against India.
The corridor indicates a thaw in relations between the two nuclear-armed foes. In September, India called off a meeting between their foreign ministers to protest the killing of Indian security personnel in Kashmir.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese prosecutors have confirmed that Nissan's arrested chairman, Carlos Ghosn, is being held in the spartan Tokyo Detention Center, its many rules and restrictions making for a stark contrast with his comfortable, globe-trotting lifestyle.
Ghosn is most probably being held in a small 4.8-sq-m (52-sq-ft) room with a toilet at one end, say experts familiar with the facility. 
Many of its rooms have traditional straw tatami mats and a futon to sleep in. Others are Western-style with beds, said a Reuters reporter who has visited there. 
Detainees are allowed to shower on set days, although not every day, said Hideto Ninomiya, a criminal defense lawyer who last visited three months ago.
Rooms lack heaters, for fear of detainees hurting themselves, and have no televisions or radios, he said. Suspects also do not have access to laptops and cell phones.
""It doesn't need to be comfortable because it's not a hotel,"" said Yasuyuki Deguchi, a professor at Tokyo Future University. ""But it's neat, hygienic and tidy."" 
Belts and neckties, as well as long-legged underwear, are prohibited, so as to foil suicide attempts, said Tsutomu Nakamura, a former prosecutor in Tokyo, the capital.
The centre ""is pretty cold at this time of year,"" internet entrepreneur and convicted fraudster Takafumi Horie told his followers on social network Twitter.
Ghosn was arrested on Monday and has not been formally charged. Japanese law permits the detention of suspects for up to 23 days before they are charged.
Nissan Motor Co., whose chief executive Ghosn was until 2017, accuses him of using company money for personal purposes and conspiring with board member Greg Kelly, who was also arrested, to under-report Ghosn's income over five years from 2010.
Ghosn has not commented on the accusations and Reuters has not been able to reach him.
""EVERYONE TREATED THE SAME""
The detention center, a tower-like structure in the eastern part of Tokyo, is where the leader of the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult, which carried out a 1995 sarin gas attack on Tokyo subways, was executed by hanging this year.
Nakamura dismissed rumors that Ghosn was being held in a special VIP room, adding, ""Everyone is treated in the same way, even a prime minister.""
The food on offer tends to be bento-type meals with little variety, Ninomiya added. Detainees are restricted from sleeping during the day, said the Reuters reporter who visited. 
Detainees can have money deposited in their accounts to buy additional food and toiletries from the commissary. Family members can also send food items, books, magazines and clothing.
The facility accommodates many foreign detainees and is equipped to cope with different languages, Deguchi said. 
""Being a foreigner does not mean you are at a disadvantage there,"" he said. ""People working there are used to foreign detainees.""
Visits by family and friends are limited to 15 minutes once a day. It was not immediately clear how much time detainees are allowed to meet lawyers.
When visiting detained clients, Ninomiya meets them in a room and speaks to them through a glass window. Some wear their own clothes and others wear gray a sweatshirt and sweatpants supplied by the facility, he said.
""They’re usually in shock and say it’s particularly hard to be in a private room because they can’t talk to anyone,"" Ninomiya said.

754,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2018 07:06AM ET</span>",Merkel's would-be successor questions Germany's sacrosanct asylum pledge,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A conservative running to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel as head of their party has raised an outcry by questioning Germany's constitutional guarantee of asylum that was enshrined to atone for World War Two Nazi crimes.
Germany's ""Grundgesetz"" (Basic Law) assures asylum to all ""politically persecuted"" - a simpler pledge in the past when it covered a handful of Soviet dissidents during the Cold War than now when millions seek sanctuary in Europe from war and poverty.
This might have to change, would-be Merkel successor Friedrich Merz said on Wednesday evening on the campaign trail in Thuringia, an eastern state where hostility to immigrants helped propel the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) to second place in the 2017 national election.
""We must be prepared to discuss the constitutional right to asylum if we seriously want a European immigration and refugee policy,"" he said to applause from local party delegates.
Merz said that Germany's constitutional guarantee was ""unique"" in the European Union, meaning Berlin could be obliged to take in refugees rejected under a common European asylum policy. The bloc is divided over how it should cope with an influx of migrants, many fleeing civil war in Syria. 
Constitutional provisions granting asylum are indeed rare. But all other EU countries have equivalently strong legal commitments to guaranteeing asylum to the persecuted, including via international conventions that have constitutional force.
His remarks were also an implicit rebuke to Merkel, whose decision in 2015 to admit over a million Syrian war refugees scrambled European politics and helped generate a far-right surge across the continent.
Merz trails Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, dubbed ""mini-Merkel"" for her similarities in policy and style, in leadership polls of Christian Democratic (CDU) party members.
The winner will be in pole position to lead the EU's largest country and economic powerhouse.
HISTORICAL PRINCIPLE
Kramp-Karrenbauer rejected Merz's proposal, saying it risked undermining a principle that was central to the CDU. 
""Abolishing the basic right of asylum or introducing limits so that it will, in effect, not exist in the way our mothers and fathers thought of it, is for me incompatible with what the CDU stands for and with the legacy of (former chancellor) Helmut Kohl,"" she told a Bild livestream event.
Kohl, who died last year, championed the idea that Germany, responsible for some of history's greatest crimes, including the Holocaust of Europe's Jews, had a special duty to foster peace by forging an integrated, democratic Europe.
Merz also appeared to align himself against Merkel with East European opponents of a U.N. migration pact during the hustings in the small Thuringian town of Seebach.
His remarks drew fire as well from Health Minister Jens Spahn, the third-placed candidate in the succession race and another critic of her liberal refugee policies.
""The constitutional right to asylum for political refugees is a great virtue of our constitution, created against the background of two world wars, great suffering and vast displacements,"" Spahn wrote on Twitter.
He himself drew applause from delegates in Seebach with a populist attack on ""excessive political correctness"", which left East Germans who had grown up with censorship under Communism ""not knowing what they are allowed to say.""
The CDU will pick a successor to Merkel, chancellor since 2005 but stepping down from the party helm after a string of regional election setbacks, at a congress in December.
Herbert Reul, CDU interior minister of North Rhine Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, was also critical of Merz's remarks.
""If he meant to question the right to asylum, then I think very little of it. We have the right to asylum in our constitution in Germany for a good reason, and that has to do with our history,"" he said in a radio interview on Thursday. 
Social Democratic Finance Minister Olaf Scholz was caustic, telling the Passauer Neue Presse newspaper it was annoying to see the ""CDU's internal popularity contest being carried out on the backs of the very weakest"" - an allusion to asylum seekers.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A bomb targeting Haqqani network militants in their hideout in Pakistan's tribal areas bordering Afghanistan killed three people on Thursday, including two militants, a security official and a militant source said. 
No group claimed responsibility for the blast.
The Haqqani network is known for bloody attacks against government institutions and foreign forces in Afghanistan, and its presence inside Pakistan is a major source of friction between Washington and Islamabad. 
The United States and Afghanistan accuse Pakistan of providing a safe haven to senior Haqqani commanders and allege the group operates freely on Pakistan's side of the porous frontier, charges that Pakistan has repeatedly denied. 
""It was the office of our commander Naik Muhammad,"" a Haqqani network source told Reuters about the attack near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Pakistan's South Waziristan region. 
""At the present we can not say who is behind this blast. It damaged our office,"" he said. 
When asked what he meant by term ""office"", the source said it was a meeting place for Haqqani and other militants. 
One of those wounded was regional Haqqani commander Jamshed Khan, he added. 
A Pakistani security official in the region said three people were killed in the attack, including two Haqqani militants, and 11 were wounded. 
U.S. officials have urged Pakistan to act against Haqqani militants but scant progress has been made. Privately, Pakistani officials say they fear such a move could see Haqqani militants turn their guns on Pakistani targets.
Since coming to office, U.S. President Donald Trump has taken a hardline stance on Pakistan, recently saying during an interview with Fox News that the South Asian country doesn't ""do a damn thing"" for the U.S. despite receiving billions of dollars in aid.
Trump's comments have further frayed the already fragile relationship between the two countries. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan hit back at Trump by saying the United States is turning Pakistan into a ""scapegoat"" to mask its own failures in Afghanistan.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - An Israeli-American man was sentenced to 10 years in prison in Israel on Thursday for making about 2,000 hoax bomb threats that forced evacuations of U.S. Jewish community centers and planes to make emergency landings.
The threats, by phone and email were made in 2016 and 2017, and raised concern at the time in the United States that anti-Semitism was on the rise.
Psychiatrists found that the defendant, now 20 but a minor when some of the crimes were committed, was on the autism spectrum and had paranoid delusions. But the Tel Aviv District Court that convicted him in June said he was fit to stand trial after it weighed medical opinions.
In passing sentence, the court said the defendant offered on the ""dark web"" - part of the Internet accessible only through special software - to make bomb and shooting threats for money, earning about $240,000 worth of the digital currency Bitcoin.
The man, who has not been named in the proceedings in Israel due his status as a minor when the offences took place, has been identified as Michael Kadar in separate indictments in the United States for alleged hate crimes.
The court in Tel Aviv had convicted Kadar of counts that included extortion, disseminating hoaxes in order to spread panic, money laundering and computer hacking over bomb and shooting threats against community centers, schools, shopping malls, police stations, airlines and airports in North America, Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Norway and Denmark.
""As a result of 142 telephone calls to airports and airlines, in which he said bombs had been planted in passenger planes or they would come under attack, aircraft were forced to make emergency landings and fighter planes were scrambled,"" the court said.
The U.S. Justice Department has said that in early 2017, Kadar made bomb threats against the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish campaign group based in New York and the Israeli embassy in Washington, as well as threatening calls about bomb and gun attacks against Jewish community centers in Florida.
Kadar, who was arrested in Israel in March 2017, is Jewish.
His parents have said he has a brain tumor that causes autism and other mental problems, making him unable to understand the nature of his actions.
""True, the accused is recognized as autistic but he is highly intelligent and understands his actions full well,"" the court said, adding that it would have sent him to jail for 17 years had he not had mental health issues.
The court also said Kadar refuses to disclose the password to his Bitcoin digital wallet and its value has since risen to more than $1 million.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia is still trying to find the cockpit voice recorder from a Lion Air jet that crashed into the sea near Jakarta last month, even though its ""ping"" signal is no longer being detected, a transport safety panel said on Thursday. 
The nearly new Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. 737 MAX passenger plane crashed into the sea on Oct. 29, just minutes after taking off from Jakarta en route to an island off Sumatra, killing all 189 on board. 
Authorities have downloaded data from one of the black boxes found days after the crash, the flight data recorder, but are still looking for the cockpit voice recorder.
""We're still putting in all our efforts to find the CVR (cockpit voice recorder),"" Soerjanto Tjahjono, the chief of Indonesia's National Transport Safety Committee (KNKT), told parliament on Thursday.
The search team was targeting an area with a radius of 300 metres (984 ft) using sonar and dredging mud from the sea floor, even though a signal initially heard from the recorder was now not being detected, he said.
Efforts to find the second black box have been hampered by strong currents and complicated by the presence of energy pipelines in the area.
The cockpit voice recorder could hold vital clues to help answer questions over the role that a new emergency system on the 737 MAX, designed to prevent it from stalling, may have played in the crash.
After the crash, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration warned airlines that erroneous inputs from the anti-stall system's sensors could lead the jet to automatically pitch its nose down even when autopilot is turned off, making it difficult to control. 
Boeing has already provided two updates for operators around the world that re-emphasize existing procedures to deal with situations relating to the system.
Lion Air, one of Boeing's largest customers globally, said on Thursday it would meet the U.S. plane maker next week to review the airline's orders for 261 Boeing 737 MAX series jets in the period until 2035.
KNKT is due to announce next Wednesday the preliminary results of its investigation into the crash.

CEZ has in the past refused to build new nuclear plants without clear state involvement, possibly through guaranteed electricity prices. Some private shareholders in CEZ have also been opposed to the project.
Babis has long preferred CEZ to be the investor. The government plans to decide on a financing model for the new unit, to built at the existing Dukovany power plant, in the coming months.

The platform, which sits on the strategically-located Bombay Reef and was revealed in satellite images published this week by a U.S. think tank, which said the structure could be used for military purposes. 
""The fact that China continues its activities in Vietnam's Paracels has seriously violated Vietnam's sovereignty on this archipelago,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Nguyen Phuong Tra told a news conference on Thursday.
""We vehemently object to this action by China and demand that China stop immediately, not repeat similar activities, and respect Vietnam's sovereignty in accordance with international law,"" said Tra.
Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Brunei also have competing claims in the South China Sea, which is known in Vietnam as the ""East Sea"".
The strategic waterway is claimed almost in its entirety by China, whose continued building of military and other installations on artificial islands and reefs there has unnerved the region and angered Washington.
China's foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Wednesday that China's sovereignty over the Paracel Islands was not in dispute, and there is nothing wrong with China carrying out construction work on its own territory.

(Reuters) - About 650,000 Tunisians went on strike on Thursday to protest the government's refusal to raise wages amid threats from international lenders to stop financing Tunisia's tattered economy. 
Schools, universities, municipalities and ministries were shut and hospitals were on emergency staffing only in the nationwide walkout organized by the UGTT union, the biggest strike action in Tunisia in five years. 
Tunisia's economy has been in turmoil since autocrat Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali was toppled in a 2011 uprising sparked by anger at unemployment and poverty.
Earlier this month the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned Tunisia to keep its public sector wage bill - one of the world's highest in proportion to GDP, according to the IMF - under control to avoid severe debt problems.
""The situation is very dangerous in light of growing inflation and low standard of living..the government will see soon a revolution of hungry and empty bellies,"" said Nourredine Taboubi, the head of the UGTT.
He said negotiations had failed because ""the sovereign decision is not in the hands of the government, but of the IMF."" 
Tunisia struck a deal struck with the IMF in December 2016 for a loan program worth around $2.8 billion to overhaul its ailing economy with steps to cut chronic deficits and trim bloated public services, but progress has been slow.
The IMF stepped up pressure on the government after it agreed to raise wages of about 150,000 employees of state companies last month in a deal with the UGTT which agreed to call off a threatened strike in return. [nL8N1XN2FZ] 
The government aims to cut the public sector wage bill to 12.5 percent of GDP in 2020 from the current 15.5 percent.
Prime Minister Youssef Chahed also faces a political crisis over his government's failure to solve Tunisia's economic woes.
""If Chahed was looking for populism or electoral interests, he would have signed the wage increase, but we want to know who will finance salaries increases"" said the government spokesman Iyad Dahmani.
He added that the international lenders including the IMF had threatened to stop financing Tunisia in the absence of the reforms.
Public sector wages have doubled to about 16 billion dinars ($5.48 billion) in 2018 from 7.6 billion dinars in 2010, officials say.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Low-lying Vanuatu is considering suing fossil fuel companies and industrialized countries that use them for their role in creating catastrophic climate change, the foreign minister of the Pacific island nation said on Thursday.
Vanuatu, with an estimated population of 280,000 people spread across roughly 80 islands, is among more than a dozen Pacific island nations that already face rising sea levels and more regular storms that can wipe out much of their economies.
Foreign Minister Ralph Regenvanu said it was time that some of the billions of dollars of profits fossil fuel companies generate every year goes toward the damage they cause in countries like ""desperate"" Vanuatu.
""This is really about claiming for the damages,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
Speaking at the Climate Vulnerable Forum’s Virtual Summit earlier in the day, Regenvanu announced the legal options Vanuatu was considering.
""My government is now exploring all avenues to utilize the judicial system in various jurisdictions - including under international law - to shift the costs of climate protection back on to fossil fuel companies, the financial institutions and the governments that actively and knowingly created this existential threat to my country,” he said.
About 64 percent of Vanuatu's GDP was wiped out in a single cyclone in 2015, causing economic losses of $449.4 million, he said.
Samoa, on behalf of the 18 Pacific island forum members, including Vanuatu, on Saturday called on leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) to pay more attention to climate change.
Regenvanu said Vanuatu was also pursuing the idea of joining hands with other nations to pursue legal action.
""We are looking for climate vulnerable countries who are willing to step up and be involved in such a case,"" he told Reuters.
He said Vanuatu would discuss it with other countries at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), known as COP24, next month.
""Vanuatu's brave announcement today is part of a global wave of legal action against oil, gas, and coal companies and laggard governments,"" Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, said in a statement.
Climate change lawsuits against big corporations and governments are on the rise. 

The U.S. city of Baltimore filed a lawsuit in June against 26 oil and gas companies and entities, including  BP  (LON:BP) Plc,  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM), for knowingly contributing to what the city called the catastrophic consequences of climate change.

""The five ... who were kidnapped in the Mirjaveh border post by the Jaish al-Zolm (Jaish al-Adl) returned home on Wednesday night. They were released after joint efforts made with the Pakistani side,"" the Guards said in a statement, Tasnim reported.
The statement provided no information about the remaining seven guards. But an Interior Ministry official told Iran's ILNA news agency that the others will be freed soon. 
The Iranian separatist group Jaish al-Adl said last month it had abducted 12 border guards, which included members of the Guards, on the border with Pakistan in Iran's southeastern Sistan-Baluchestan province. 
The group said it had seized the personnel to avenge the oppression of Sunni Muslims in the area by Iran’s Shi’ite Muslim rulers. 
In September, the Guards killed four Sunni militants at a border crossing with Pakistan, including the second-in-command of Jaish al-Adl.
Jaish al-Adl kidnapped five Iranian border guards in 2014, releasing four of them two months later after mediation by local Sunni clerics.
Iran had threatened to hit militant bases in Pakistan unless Islamabad took action to secure its border area, which Tehran says has become a safe haven for anti-Iran groups to operate.

775,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2018 02:47AM ET</span>",Head of Russian spy agency accused of British poison attack dies,"By Maria Tsvetkova and Andrew Osborn
MOSCOW (Reuters) - The head of Russia's GRU military intelligence agency that the West has blamed for a string of brazen attacks died on Wednesday after ""a serious and long illness,"" the Russian defense ministry said.
State news agency TASS cited the ministry as saying Igor Korobov, 62, who ran the spy agency since 2016, had been made a Hero of Russia for his service in the post, the highest state award.
Britain has accused the GRU of attempting to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter with a nerve agent in the city of Salisbury, the Netherlands has accused it of trying to hack the global chemical weapons watchdog, and U.S. intelligence agencies say it tried to hack the 2016 presidential election.
Russia denies all those allegations. 
Speculation about Korobov's fate had been growing since an unconfirmed Russian media report that he had been summoned by President Vladimir Putin after the Skripal affair and severely criticized for the operation which left the Skripals alive and the GRU a target of mockery in the Western media. 
Korobov was absent from a ceremony in Moscow this month where Putin and other senior officials celebrated the centenary of the GRU, with the Russian leader praising its skill and ""unique abilities.""
Operatives of the agency, widely known by its old acronym of GRU, set an example for a future generation of military spies, said Putin, himself a former intelligence officer, citing their readiness to sacrifice everything ""for the motherland"".
SOVIET VETERAN
Korobov's death paves the way for Putin to appoint a successor to head an agency that intelligence experts say has stepped up its covert missions as tension mounts between Russia and the West, which has imposed sanctions on Moscow over its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea.
Asked last month if there would be a shake-up at the defense ministry in the aftermath of the Skripal affair, the Kremlin said the low quality of the allegations leveled at GRU did not justify such changes.
The United States included Korobov's name on a March sanctions blacklist of people believed to have helped ""undermine cyber security on behalf of the Russian government"".
Korobov was a Soviet military veteran who served in the air force and, according to his official biography, began working for the GRU in 1985. 

The GRU, founded as the registration directorate in 1918 after the Bolshevik revolution, is one of Russia's three main intelligence agencies, alongside the domestic Federal Security Service and the SVR Foreign Intelligence Service.

Kolony Kala Bama was convicted on Monday of illegally transporting at least five people to Australia by boat in August last year, a Queensland court spokeswoman said. He had already served 450 days in custody. 
There were six Chinese men on the boat, one of whom was working with Bama, media had reported. 
Australia's then Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the Chinese nationals had been sent back to China.
""We have detected a boatload of people coming to Australia. We have very good border security strategies in place and these people have been detected,"" Bishop said at the time.
Under Australia's tough immigration policy, asylum seekers arriving by boat are told they will never be allowed to settle in Australia. They are detained in detention centers on remote South Pacific islands until they are accepted by another nation or agree to return home.
The camps have been widely criticized by the United Nations and human rights groups. 
On Wednesday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that Australia would not sign the U.N. Compact for Migration because it would compromise its immigration policy.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian nationals convicted of terror offences would be stripped of their citizenship if the government believes they are entitled to apply for residency from another country, Prime Minister Scott Morrison proposed on Thursday.
Australia, a staunch U.S. ally that sent troops to Afghanistan and Iraq, has seen a spate of attacks by home-grown militants in recent months, including a stabbing attack in the country's second largest city less than two weeks ago. 
Morrison proposed allowing the government to weaken current constraints that permit terror convicts to be stripped of their Australian citizenship only if they are already dual nations and they have been sentenced to more than six years in prison. 
""This is something that can't be tolerated, and for those who would engage in this sort of activity, and they have citizenship elsewhere or we have reason to believe they (can) do, they can go,"" Morrison told reporters in Sydney. 
Morrison's proposal will require approval from the country's parliament, where the government does not enjoy a majority. 
It is also likely to face legal challenges, experts said. 
""It is not clear that the commonwealth has the power to kick out people who have been here for many, many generations,"" said Sangeetha Pillai, constitutional lawyer at the Kaldor Centre, University of New South. 
""This legislation would make some people stateless at least temporary and in some cases, permanently."" 
Morrison's policy proposal comes just days after Australian police arrested and charged three dual nationals with plotting a mass attack on the public in Melbourne. 
Despite the arrests nullifying the threat from this group, Australia continues to be on heightened alert for future attacks. 
Australia currently sees the likelihood of a militant attack as ""probable"", the midpoint on a five-level threat ranking system. It has been set at that level since the system was introduced in 2015. 
Keen to give investigators added tools, Morrison demanded parliament pass legislation that would compel technology companies provide access to encrypted messages before 2019. 
Seen as test case as other nations explore similar laws,  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL) have jointly began lobby lawmakers to amend the bill.

Prosecutors said Santos Lopez participated in the 1982 mass killings of nearly all of the men, women and children in the farming village of Dos Erres.
Lopez was accused of being part of the elite Special Patrol of Kaibiles that was sent to Dos Erres to find members of a guerrilla group that had ambushed a military convoy.
When the patrol failed to find the guerrillas or guns, they pulled villagers from their homes and raped many of the young girls, according to prosecutors. To cover up the rapes, they killed nearly everyone living there. 
The massacre was carried out during the regime of former Guatemalan military dictator Efrain Rios Montt, who died in April facing charges of genocide for acts during one of the bloodiest phases of the Cold War-era conflict that lasted from 1960 until 1996..

780,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2018 10:10PM ET</span>",Modi's backers step up holy site dispute as Indian election looms,"By Krishna N. Das
AYODHYA, India (Reuters) - When a Hindu mob tore down a centuries-old mosque in the northern Indian town of Ayodhya 26 years ago, Haji Mahboob Ahmad says he and his family had to flee to a Muslim religious school miles away to escape deadly rioting.
In days of communal clashes that followed more than a dozen people were killed in Ayodhya and about 2,000 people across the country. Ahmad said when he returned to his house, about a mile south of the disputed site, it had been gutted by fire.
Now leaders of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its affiliates are stepping up efforts to build a massive Hindu temple where the mosque once stood, and Ahmad and many of the other 5,000 Muslims still living in the town say they once again feel under siege.
""They're playing a dangerous game in the name of Ayodhya,"" Ahmad, a 65-year-old Muslim community leader, said as he sat beside his rifle-toting police guard. Ahmad has been getting round-the-clock police security since months after the riots.
""This is the biggest build-up in favor of a temple since the mosque was destroyed. They are provoking the public. They are stirring up emotions.""
Muslim leaders are considering temporarily moving members of the community out of Ayodhya on Sunday, when tens of thousands of Hindu seers and monks are expected to gather demanding a new temple on the site, fearing religious tensions.
Many Hindus believe the mosque destroyed in 1992 was built in the same place where Lord Ram, a physical incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu, was born. They also point to evidence there was a temple there before the mosque was built in 1528.
Facing a general election by next May, and concerns about the impact on voters of low farm prices, weak jobs growth and the difficulty small businesses face in borrowing, BJP leaders are seeking to shore up support among the most devoted in India's Hindu majority.
Ayodhya is in politically important Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state with more than 220 million people and the most lawmakers in parliament's lower house. The state's BJP chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, is a hardline Hindu priest.
The party made a near-clean sweep there in 2014, helping Modi win the country's biggest parliamentary mandate in three decades, but pollsters predict a tighter contest next year.
(GRAPHIC - Disputed sacred site : https://tmsnrt.rs/2R1N104)
HINDU CONGREGATION
Modi himself has been largely silent on the issue, and his government did not respond to a request seeking comment. But top BJP lieutenants, such as its President Amit Shah, have been increasingly vocal in pressing for a new temple on the site.
Earlier this month, Adityanath held a big celebration in Ayodhya to mark the Diwali festival of lights, a major Hindu event. He also got the name of the district where the town is located changed from Faizabad, a Muslim name, to Ayodhya. His government has promised to build a 201 meter-tall statue of Ram to tower over the disputed site from a couple of miles away. 
Around 100,000 Hindu religious leaders - more than the population of the core area of Ayodhya - are expected to assemble just a couple of miles away on Nov. 25 to press their demand that the government introduce legislation that would allow a new temple on the site. An even bigger protest of 500,000 is planned for New Delhi next month.
Zafaryab Jilani, a secretary of the All-India Muslim Personal Law Board, said many Muslims in Ayodhya were worried about their security during the religious gathering in the town.
The Uttar Pradesh government is also considering expanding a ban on meat in the town to a much bigger area on the demands of Hindu religious leaders. Muslim butchers dominate the meat business.
Aarif Mohammed, a Muslim who sells mutton and chicken at a shop about 7 km (4 miles) from the controversial site, said he would accept any government or court decision in favor of a Ram temple, but a meat ban would be financially damaging.
""We won't be able to switch to something else easily,"" said the 35-year-old. ""We want an end to the dispute soon, we want peace. Tensions only weaken us, drag us back.""
Some Muslims in Ayodhya are less accepting of temple plans. Every year on Dec. 6, dozens gather at the porch of community leader Ahmad's house to ""mourn"" the anniversary of the mosque's demolition, he said.
Ahmad, who wants a mosque rebuilt on the site, says the BJP is stirring up trouble as part of its election campaigning. ""They want the votes of those who get swayed easily by matters of belief,"" he said.
It is not the only case in which the ruling party has been accused of exploiting religious divisions. The government has begun deporting Rohingya Muslim refugees, but wants to make it easier for Hindu asylum seekers to gain citizenship. Many BJP-ruled states have expanded bans on the trading of cows revered in Hinduism, and increased funding for cow shelters that take cattle seized from Muslim traders.
The BJP denies it has a bias against Muslims, but says it is opposed to giving unfair advantage to any community, a practice it describes as ""appeasement"" and accuses the opposition Congress party of long following to win votes.
""BODY, MIND AND GUN""
In September 2010, Uttar Pradesh's Allahabad High Court ruled that the main site where the mosque once stood be split into three parts, one for Muslims and two for Hindus. Both Muslim and Hindu groups challenged that judgment in the Supreme Court where it remains unresolved, with the top court's chief justice delaying a further hearing on the matter at least until January.
Many leaders of the BJP, hardline group Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), and their parent movement, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), are demanding the government issue an executive order to bypass the Supreme Court so they can build the temple on the site, now under court control.
""We have waited for the court to decide for a long time, but we are now done with them,"" said VHP spokesman Sharad Sharma in Ayodhya. ""If there's a delay in justice, people will get agitated. The result of such agitation we saw in 1992.""
Many Hindus do support the construction of a temple at the site, a place they say is equivalent to Saudi Arabia's Kaaba, a building in Mecca that is the most sacred site in Islam.
On a recent visit to Ayodhya, dozens of Hindu pilgrims told Reuters that only Modi's party was willing to construct the temple. The BJP said in its 2014 election manifesto it would ""explore all possibilities within the framework of the constitution"" to help build a temple.
""This is a country of us Hindus, Ayodhya is the heartland of us Hindus, can't we get it back?,"" said Mumbai-resident Vinod Trewaria, 49. He was visiting an Ayodhya workshop where a sculptor worked on ornate carvings to be used in a future temple and two priests chanted: ""Ram, Ram - Sita, Ram"". According to Hindu epic Ramayana, Sita was the wife of Ram.
""The secular lobby, the communist lobby, all these people are standing in the way,"" said Trewaria. ""Courts are also mocking our sentiments. Only Yogi and Modi are working toward it.""
The place where the Babri Mosque once stood is now guarded by armed state and federal police and surrounded by walls and watchtowers. Visitors can only view small idols of Ram and his brother Laxman from behind iron bars beneath a tent.
Visitors were frisked three times when Reuters visited last week. Bags, mobile phones, watches, pens and cameras were not allowed.
As the Ram idol came into sight, one visitor called out: ""Jai Shri Ram,"" - hail Lord Ram. An elderly man dressed in red and yellow cloth shouted back: ""Jai Shri Ram"".
Later, at a nearby temple complex, Bablu Khan, an elected BJP council member in Ayodhya, said it was time to settle the dispute for good.
""This time we will give it our all - tann, mann and gun,"" he said - rhyming the English word gun with the Hindi for body and mind - ""to get a temple built.""

The Straits Times newspaper, often seen as close to the government, reported on Thursday citing unnamed sources that the People's Action Party is due to announce positions within its central executive committee (CEC) on Friday, including the crucial post of first assistant secretary general.
The role is immediately under the secretary general, currently held by Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong who has pledged to step down in coming years with an election expected as soon as next year. 
Contenders for the role of first assistant secretary general have narrowed to Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat, 57, and Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing, 49, the newspaper said.
The PAP has dominated Singapore's politics over the five decades since the city-state's independence, winning all the elections with significant majorities, and faces no real challenge to its power. 
""Singaporeans will get a good indication of who is most likely to succeed Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong as People's Action Party (PAP) leader and the country's fourth prime minister tomorrow,"" the Straits Times said.
A spokesman for the PAP declined to comment on the article.
PM Lee - the son of Singapore's founding father Lee Kuan Yew - suggested earlier this month a general election may be called next year, more than a year before his government's mandate ends.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Wednesday a joint military exercise with South Korea called ""Foal Eagle"" would be reduced in scope next year so it does not harm diplomatic efforts with North Korea.
""Foal Eagle is being reorganized a bit to keep it at a level that will not be harmful to diplomacy,"" Mattis told reporters.
The Foal Eagle field exercise, which usually involves thousands of combined ground, air, naval and special operations troops, takes place every spring.
Mattis did not provide details on what a scaled-back version of the exercise would entail.
South Korea's defense ministry said on Thursday the allies were still in talks over next year's drill and they would formally announce their decision early next month.
""Both sides' militaries are discussing ways to prop up the two governments' diplomatic efforts to bring progress on North Korea's denuclearization,"" spokeswoman Choi Hyun-soo told a news briefing in Seoul.
U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed at an unprecedented summit in June to work toward denuclearization and peace on the Korean peninsula and establish new relations.
The United States and South Korea have suspended a number of military exercises since then to encourage talks with North Korea.
However, negotiations have since made little headway, with Pyongyang upset by Washington's insistence that international sanctions must remain until North Korea gives up its nuclear weapons.
Trump caught many U.S. officials off guard when he announced after his summit with Kim that the United States was suspending the summer's joint military drills with South Korea, known as Ulchi Freedom Guardian.
The new commander of U.S. forces in South Korea, General Robert Abrams, said in September the decision to suspend some joint exercises was a ""prudent risk"" but had caused a ""slight degradation"" in military readiness.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday the United States had told its ally South Korea it should not improve ties with North Korea faster than Pyongyang takes steps to give up its nuclear weapons.

In a rare sign of discord between Seoul and Washington last month, South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said Pompeo had expressed ""discontent"" at an inter-Korean military pact reached during a summit in September.

NATAL AIR FORCE BASE, Brazil (Reuters) - The air forces of 14 nations including the United States are taking part this week in air combat exercises and non-conventional warfare training at a base in northern Brazil, the Brazilian Air Force said on Wednesday.
Some 100 planes are involved in the so-called Southern (NYSE:SO) Cross or CruzEx exercises, including six F-16 from the Texas Air National Guard alongside aircraft from Brazil, Canada, Chile, France, Peru and Uruguay.
They practiced simulated scenarios to prepare for potential events across the world including peacekeeping and stability operations, as well as providing support in humanitarian response operations in the aftermath of natural disasters.
""The purpose of CruzEx is to increase cooperation and share experiences to be able to act with greater synergy,"" said Brazilian Air Force Brigadier Luiz Guilherme Medeiros, director of the air exercises organized in Brazil since 2002. 
There was greater emphasis on non-conventional warfare this year, with troops parachuting from planes and rappelling down ropes from helicopters.
Venezuela, which took part with F-16s at the last gathering in 2013, did not bring any aircraft this year.
The Natal Air Force Base, on the northeastern tip of Brazil, played an important role in Brazilian cooperation with the U.S. military during World War II as a refueling station for aircraft flying troops and equipment to Northern Africa.

In 1943, U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt met at the base with Brazilian President Getulio Vargas on his way back from a conference with British leader Winston Churchill in Casablanca.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A year of warming relations between North and South Korea has raised the prospects of closer ties, if not some form of unification for the still-warring neighbors far in the future. But it might not be obvious in a typical South Korean classroom. 
""I really don't know anything,"" 17-year-old student Roh Ha-na said. ""It's like only twice a year that the school teaches about unification and national security, and about North Korean life... but I just let most of it go in one ear and out the other.""This year's inter-Korean détente has highlighted what many observers see as a lack of knowledge among South Koreans about their northern neighbor, prompting government efforts to revamp the way South Koreans learn about North Korea and unification.
Baek Jun-kee, the head of South Korea's Institute for Unification Education says current education methods have failed to show young South Koreans the importance of a nuanced understanding of North Korea, its people and leader Kim Jong Un.
""If we don't approach the issue in a rational manner or show how the issue affects (students') personal lives in middle school or high school, it will be difficult to keep their attention,"" Baek told Reuters in an interview.
The education shortcomings are contributing to a shortage of North Korea experts across public and private institutions at a time when increased cultural and governmental exchanges between the two Koreas make them all the more important, analysts say.
""Every regional government has rolled out plans for inter-Korean exchange, but they don't have any experts, no knowledge, no networks,"" said Hong Min, a research fellow at the Korea Institute for National Unification. ""When the heads of South Korean conglomerates went along to the September Pyongyang summit, most of them didn't have an in-house North Korea expert to brief the chief.""
After facing criticism at a parliamentary hearing earlier this month over funding cuts to education programs, Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon told lawmakers creating a new curriculum on unification was ""crucial and urgent"".
""WASTE OF TIME""
Cut off from the North for 70 years and still technically at war after their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce not a peace treaty, many South Koreans have come to see unification as an increasingly distant and unrealistic goal.
Surveys show younger generations of South Koreans are particularly ignorant or apathetic about their northern neighbors, seeing them as a troublesome distraction from the more pressing concerns of work or school.
Interviews with 17 high school students revealed most had never heard of the 'parallel progress' policy key to North Korean affairs this decade. Most didn't know about the growth of private markets that has transformed many areas of North Korea's economy. 
""I've never heard about these North Korean issues in school, aside from learning about the Korean War in history class,"" said Moon So-in, a 17-year-old student at Sunil Girls' High School. 
""My friends don't seem very interested since we are so used to being a divided country."" 
Education in South Korea is focused on competing for college entrance, culminating in high-pressure nationwide exams in the last year of high school, on which students stake their futures.
North Korea is ""not on the test,"" students and teachers said, and is therefore seen as a ""waste of precious time,"" said high school teacher Choi Ki-bok.
Generally, North Korea is addressed in a single chapter once a year in 4th and 6th grade, briefly in middle school and once in high school, two teachers said.
In higher education, meanwhile, five out of six North Korean studies departments at South Korean universities have been shut down or changed into other programs in recent years, in part because of a lack of applicants. 
SPARKING DEBATE
In North Korea, the South appears to be discussed more often in schools. As well as propaganda, North Korean defectors say they were taught minute details about the South.
""I was taught South Korean geography down to what minerals and grains are produced in each region, history that happened on South Korean soil,"" said Park Na-ri, a North Korean defector educator who taught Korean and literature in Pyongyang and now teaches defector children in Seoul. 
""I was shocked to find South Koreans know much less about where anything in North Korea is,"" she said, noting that ignorance can lead to a lack of empathy for North Koreans.
Five South Korean educators interviewed by Reuters said teachers don't feel equipped to navigate the thorny issue of North Korea, which in the words of one high school teacher is ""an enemy, a long-lost brother, and a separate country sharing a border, depending on who you ask"". 
The Institute for Unification Education, which oversees all lower education on North Korea, says it is setting up the first-ever year-long training programs for teachers to learn how to teach North Korea.
That will include a shift away from rote teaching on unification as a given to a more flexible approach focused more on the goal of peace and designed to spark discussions among students.

This year, the 91-page ""Unification Education Guidelines"" was cut down to 48 pages and renamed ""Unification and Peace Education, Directions and Viewpoints"", mirroring President Moon Jae-in's argument that reaching peace with North Korea is a more pressing and realistic goal than full unification.

Although a vote was not legally necessary -- ratification is only needed in the European Parliament and, far tricker, the British parliament -- Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar wanted to show that politicians from all sides supported his position. 
As fewer than 10 members of the 158 in parliament stood up against the motion, the speaker of the house declared it carried.
The draft divorce deal for Britain's exit from the European Union is set to be approved by EU leaders on Sunday, alongside a political declaration on future trade, with the arduous task then falling to Prime Minister Theresa May to win over a majority of skeptical British lawmakers.
""The support of this house for the draft withdrawal agreement, I am sure will send a strong signal ahead of the European Council on Sunday that Ireland is behind this deal fully,"" Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said.
Varadkar enjoyed cross-party support throughout the talks in a bid to avoid the return of border checks between EU-member Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland, which many feel would threaten a 20-year-old peace deal that ended three decades of sectarian bloodshed in Northern Ireland.
The agreement includes a provision that would avoid such checks returning, with the so-called Northern Ireland backstop responsible for much of the disquiet among Theresa May's own party.
Wednesday's motion was supported by Sinn Fein, the Irish nationalist party whose lawmakers sit in both the parliament in Dublin and devolved assembly in Belfast, but refuse to take the seven seats they currently hold in the British parliament.
The party contests British elections in the province on the understanding that they will not sit in parliament because they oppose the British government's jurisdiction in Northern Ireland and do not want to make an oath to the British queen.
The party's leadership insists that they will not make an exception for the Brexit vote in London in the coming weeks.

PANAMA CITY (Reuters) - The two sons of jailed former Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli have been arrested in Miami and face extradition back home on money-laundering charges, Panama's attorney general said on Wednesday. 
Attorney General Kenia Porcell told local television that Martinelli's sons, Luis Enrique Martinelli and Ricardo Martinelli, had been arrested, but said he was awaiting further details.
""Yes, they have confirmed the detention of these people,"" Porcell said.
Panamanian prosecutors in November 2017 accused the two of receiving $49 million from Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht [ODBES.UL] while their father was president.
A lawyer for the two sons said he could not confirm their arrest and did not have further comments on the charges.
The elder Martinelli, a former supermarket tycoon who led Panama from 2009 to 2014, has been held in a prison on the outskirts of Panama City since June after being extradited from the United States. 
He faces charges that he used public money to spy on more than 150 political rivals during his presidency.
Martinelli has said he is being persecuted for political reasons by President Juan Carlos Varela. 
Luis Camacho, Martinelli's spokesman, said the charges against the former president's sons also appeared to be tainted by political pressures.
Last year, Odebrecht agreed to pay $220 million in fines to Panama and to cooperate with probes into bribes paid to Panamanian officials.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Wednesday that he had been granted authority to allow troops on the Mexican border greater powers to help protect border officials, and would await direction from the Department of Homeland Security. 
Reuters reported on Monday that the White House was likely to give troops authority to protect Customs and Border Protection agents stationed along the U.S. border with Mexico if they come under threat from migrants seeking to cross into the United States.
Speaking with reporters on Wednesday, Mattis confirmed that he had been given the additional authority, but would await a request from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) before deciding how to use it.
""I have the authority to do more, now we'll see what she asks me for,"" Mattis said, referring to DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. He said he had no immediate intention of changing the mission.
Mattis said, depending on the DHS request, that troops may be given powers to temporarily detain migrants, but not the authority to arrest them. They would only be permitted to detain migrants for ""minutes, not even hours"" while they hand them over to border agents.
He said troops could help protect the border agents with shields and batons, but would be unarmed.
Two U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said a memo signed by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly gave Mattis the authority to protect immigration agents and if necessary, could include actions like use of lethal force, crowd control, temporary detention and cursory searches. 
The deployment of about 5,800 active duty troops to the Mexico border to bolster defenses ahead of the expected arrival of a caravan of mostly Honduran migrants has raised questions in Congress and among legal experts about troop deployments on U.S. soil.
The Pentagon has said in the past that there were no plans for U.S. forces to interact with migrants and that they have been carrying out support tasks.
The Posse Comitatus Act, a federal law on the books since the 1870s, restricts using the U.S. Army and other main branches of the military for civilian law enforcement on U.S. soil, unless specifically authorized by Congress.
""There is no violation of Posse Comitatus, there's no violation here at all,"" Mattis said.
Asked if the border mission could be extended, Mattis said it was dependent on the situation, but at least some troops would be back home before Christmas. He also said that fresh troops could be assigned new missions.

Smith, 95, who rose to fame in 2014 after giving a powerful speech at the UK Labour Party's convention and documented his fight for social justice in a podcast called ""Harry's Last Stand,"" was hospitalized in Belleville, Ontario.
""Harry is in (the emergency department) and not in a good way,"" his son John tweeted, taking over his father's Twitter account on Tuesday. ""He asked me to inform you in case things don’t work out. I will keep you posted.""
That prompted thousands of well wishes from Twitter users, under the hashtag #IStandWithHarry, including from Canadian and British politicians and refugee organizations.
""He's stood #WithRefugees since he first saw them with his own eyes during WWII. Now it's our turn to stand with him,"" the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees tweeted Wednesday.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted that ""we're pulling for you,"" while UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn wrote ""we need him to get well soon ... our movement, needs him."" 
The outpouring was ""humbling,"" son John Smith told Reuters. Smith has been posting regular updates on his father's Twitter account, @harryslaststand. 
Smith survived Britain's post-World War One recession in abject poverty and spent much of his later life campaigning to ensure others did not experience the same, his son said. Besides healthcare and refugee advocacy, Smith has written several books since turning 87.
On Wednesday, Smith was being moved to an intensive care unit with low blood pressure and suspected pneumonia, his son said. ""He's in critical condition, but not acute critical condition.""
Until his fall, Smith was in the middle of a tour of refugee hotspots around the world. If he recuperates, his son said, the plan is to visit the Canada-U.S. border, where thousands of asylum seekers have been walking across the border to file refugee claims. 
""I don't know Harry personally but I feel as if a friend is ill tonight. Harry, you are an inspiration and a light when the world seems dark,"" Twitter user @Hawkonaridge said.

PORT BLAIR, India (Reuters) - An American self-styled adventurer and Christian missionary has been killed and buried by a tribe of hunter-gatherers on a remote island in the Indian Ocean where he had gone to proselytize, local law enforcement officials said on Wednesday. 
John Allen Chau, 26, was slain on North Sentinel Island, which is home to what is considered the last pre-Neolithic tribe in the world and typically out of bounds to visitors, said Dependra Pathak, the director general of police in Andaman and Nicobar.
""A murder case has been registered against unknown persons,"" Pathak said, adding that the local fishermen suspected of illegally ferrying Chau to the 60-square-km (23-square-mile) island had been arrested on separate charges.
Chau was killed by members of the Sentinelese community using bows and arrows, according to multiple media accounts.
Chau's social media posts identify him as an adventurer and explorer. Responding to a travel blog query about what was on the top of his adventure list, Chau said: ""Going back to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in India.""
Chau also said in the blog: ""I definitely get my inspiration for life from Jesus.""
Based on his social media posts, Chau appears to have visited India multiple times in the last few years, exploring and preaching in many parts of southern India.
""We recently learned from an unconfirmed report that John Allen Chau was reported killed in India while reaching out to members of the Sentinelese Tribe in the Andaman Islands,"" members of the Chau family said in a post on his Instagram page. 
The family described him as a ""beloved son, brother and uncle"" as well as a Christian missionary, wilderness emergency medical technician, soccer coach and mountaineer.
""He loved God, life, helping those in need and had nothing but love for the Sentinelese people,"" the family said. ""We forgive those reportedly responsible for his death. We also ask for the release of those friends he had in the Andaman Islands.""
The family asked that local contacts not be prosecuted in the case.
BURIED IN THE SAND
Police said in a statement that they had launched an investigation into Chau's death after being contacted by the U.S. consulate in the southern Indian city of Chennai.
""We are aware of reports concerning a U.S. citizen in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands,"" a consulate spokeswoman said in an email, but declined to provide further details.
Pathak said a Coast Guard vessel with police and experts on the tribe had gone to scout the island and formulate a plan to recover Chau's body. North Sentinel Island is about 50 km (31 miles) west of Port Blair, the capital of the island cluster. 
Chau made two or three trips to the island by canoe from Nov. 15, making contact with the tribe but returning to his boat, Pathak said. He told the fishermen on Nov. 16 he would not come back from the island and instructed them to return home and pass on some handwritten notes he had made to a friend.
The next morning they saw his body being dragged across a beach and buried in the sand, the police chief said, adding: ""This was a misplaced adventure in a highly protected area."" 
A source with access to Chau's notes said Chau had taken scissors, safety pins and a football as gifts to the tribe. 
In his notes, the source said, Chau wrote that some members of the tribe were good to him while others were very aggressive.
""I have been so nice to them. Why are they so angry and so aggressive?"" the source quoted Chau as saying.
The source, who asked not to be named, said Chau wrote that he was ""doing this to establish the kingdom of Jesus on the island...Do not blame the natives if I am killed.""

In 2006, two fishermen who strayed onto the island were killed and their bodies never recovered. An Indian Coast Guard helicopter sent to retrieve the bodies was repelled by a volley of arrows from the community.

DUBAI (Reuters) - International police organization Interpol on Wednesday elected Kim Jong-yang of South Korea as president, beating a Russian whose candidacy had raised concerns in Europe and the United States about the risk of Kremlin interference.
Interpol's Secretary-General Jurgen Stock told reporters Kim's election was free and transparent after Russia said clear outside pressure had been exerted on the vote.
Kim was elected president, a largely ceremonial role, at Interpol's annual congress in Dubai for a two-year term to succeed China's Meng Hongwei. The presidency is typically held for four years.
""The general assembly elected Mr. Kim from Korea as president through a voting process which was democratic, transparent, free and clear,"" said Stock of Germany who heads day-to-day work at Interpol.
The president is elected after winning a two-thirds majority among members in a secret ballot, according to Interpol's website.
U.S. and European politicians and Kremlin critics had lobbied against the candidacy of Alexander Prokopchuk of Russia, a police major-general and one of Interpol's four vice-presidents. 
""No matter ... what the nationality of the presidency is, it is not affecting Interpol's neutrality and the independence of our organization,"" said Stock.
Interpol's role is to facilitate cooperation between police forces around the world. Its charter forbids it from involving itself in disputes of a political, religious or racial nature. It is not a supranational police force and has no agents who are allowed to make arrests.
A bipartisan group of U.S. senators this week accused Russia of exploiting the global body to settle scores and harass dissidents by issuing warrants, known as red notices, for their arrest.
""Let me be crystal clear, the members of the executive committee, including the president, have absolutely no involvement or influence in the task force review or decision making process,"" said Stock. 
RUSSIAN REGRET
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters: ""We regret that it wasn't our candidate, but nonetheless there are no grounds to disagree with the election result.""
Prokopchuk declined to comment.
Kim, 57, worked in the South Korean police for more than 20 years before retiring in 2015. 
Kim, who had been acting president, is now completing the term of former president Meng, which was due to end in 2020. Kim will not be able to seek a second term under Interpol rules which limit the presidency to a single term, said Stock.
Meng disappeared in September during a visit to China from where he sent a letter to Interpol announcing his resignation. Days after his wife reported him missing, Chinese authorities said he was under investigation. 
""Our world is now facing unprecedented changes which present huge challenges to public security and safety,"" Kim said in a statement. ""To overcome them, we need a clear vision: we need to build a bridge to the future.""
South Korea's President Moon Jae-in congratulated Kim on becoming the first South Korean to head the organization. 

Pacific island nations Vanuatu and Kiribati were approved this week as new Interpol member countries, while Kosovo's bid was denied, bringing the total number of member states to 194. A number of countries including Serbia do not recognize Kosovo's independence from Belgrade, declared in 2008.

""They are within our reach and we can hit them if they (Americans) make a move,"" Amirali Hajizadeh, head of the Revolutionary Guards' airspace division, was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency.
Hajizadeh said the Guards had improved the precision of their missiles, and specifically said they could hit the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, Al Dhafra base in the United Arab Emirates and Kandahar base in Afghanistan that host U.S. forces.
U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of an international agreement on Iran's nuclear programme in May and reimposed sanctions on Tehran. He said the deal was flawed because it did not include curbs on Iran's development of ballistic missiles or its support for proxies in Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and Iraq.
The Islamic Republic's government has ruled out negotiations with Washington over its military capabilities, particularly its missile programme run by the Guards.
Iran, which says its missile programme is purely defensive, has threatened to disrupt oil shipments through the Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf if the United States tries to strangle Iranian oil exports.

In October, the Revolutionary Guards fired missiles at Islamic State militants in Syria after the Islamist group took responsibility for an attack at a military parade in Iran that killed 25 people, nearly half of them members of the Guards.

795,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2018 04:52PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. weighs sanctions on Cuban officials over role in Venezuela crackdown,"By Alexandra Ulmer and Matt Spetalnick
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is considering imposing sanctions on Cuban military and intelligence officials who it says are helping Venezuela's socialist government crackdown on dissent, according to a source with knowledge of the deliberations.
Such sanctions would be the first time Washington has targeted a bloc of foreign officials allied with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. OPEC member Venezuela is in the grips of a prolonged recession, its economy dogged by hyperinflation and food shortages.
The White House declined comment in response to Reuters questions about possible Cuba sanctions. The Cuban and Venezuelan governments did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
U.S. President Donald Trump's Republican administration has already imposed sanctions on dozens of Venezuelan officials, and has sought to disrupt the country's growing gold exports and access to external financing as part of a pressure campaign against Maduro. 
The potential human rights-related sanctions would target Cuban officials, possibly including generals, who Washington accuses of advising Venezuela's government on how to monitor opponents and put down street protests, the source said. 
The number and identities of the potential targets was unclear. No final decision has yet been made on whether and when to impose the sanctions. 
The measures would cast a further chill on U.S.-Cuba relations, where Trump has rolled back some of former President Barack Obama's moves aimed at forging closer ties, and also fuel Maduro's assertion that Washington is bent on undermining his government for ideological reasons. 
Cuba and Venezuela became close allies under the rule of late Presidents Fidel Castro and Hugo Chavez. Since a series of bilateral agreements in 2000, the Communist island's economy depends heavily on Venezuelan crude oil, which Havana compensates for by providing Venezuela with Cuban doctors and other services. 
The United States and Venezuelan opposition politicians have long maintained that Cuban military and intelligence officials advise Maduro's government and security forces on the crackdown. 
While Maduro often travels to Havana and the Cuban ambassador is a frequent guest at government meetings in Caracas, the extent of Cuba's influence on and support for Venezuela's government and military is not publicly known. 
There are questions about how effective measures targeting Cuban officials would be. 
Human rights-related sanctions typically freeze assets, seize property, block travel in the United States and prohibit U.S. business dealings with the targets. However, given Washington has maintained a six-decade financial and trade embargo on Cuba, few if any Cuban officials are believed to have a sizeable financial presence in the United States.
In the past, Maduro has blasted sanctions as ""imperialist"" moves designed to complicate financial transactions, including food imports and bond payments. He has also derided U.S. sanctions on himself and other Venezuelan officials as ineffective and a badge of honor. 
Maduro's government has been criticized by Washington, the European Union and Latin American neighbors for overriding Venezuela's opposition-led Congress, jailing opponents, using excessive force against protesters and failing to allow the entry of foreign humanitarian aid to ease the economic crisis.
'TROIKA OF TYRANNY' 
The Trump administration has in the past floated the idea of sanctions that were not ultimately rolled out, and Washington has stressed it wants to minimize harm to Venezuelan people.
Asked about possible sanctions on Cuban officials, a senior U.S. government official told Reuters in early November: ""We are looking at all the potential avenues to deter those who are really helping the Maduro regime stay afloat and giving them the tools they need for repression."" 
Trump's national security adviser John Bolton said earlier this month Washington would take a tougher line against Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, calling them a ""troika of tyranny.""
""The Venezuelan regime's repression is of course enabled by the Cuban dictatorship,"" Bolton said during a speech in Miami, home to a diaspora of Venezuelans and Cubans who have historically been a bedrock of Republican support in swing state Florida.
""The United States calls on all nations in the region to face this obvious truth, and let the Cuban regime know that it will be held responsible for continued oppression in Venezuela,"" Bolton said. 
Trump's top Latin America adviser, Mauricio Claver-Carone, is a Cuban-American who was opposed to Obama's historic opening to Cuba after a 2014 diplomatic breakthrough between the two Cold War foes.

""There is an important Cuba angle to the Venezuela crisis,"" said Michael McCarthy, a research fellow at American University who studies Latin America. ""The question is whether a forceful persuasion strategy that goes regional by pressuring Cuba generates constructive engagement or pushback.""

The observation posts would not require additional U.S. troops being sent to Syria, Mattis told reporters. The Pentagon says it has about 2,000 troops in Syria. 
The United States has long been complained that tensions between Turkey and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which includes the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, have at times slowed down progress on fighting Islamic State militants.
The observation posts are aimed at ensuring that Turkey and the SDF remain focused on clearing final Islamic State strongholds.
""We are putting in observation posts in several locations up along the Syria border, northern Syria border, because we want to be the people who call the Turks and warn them if we see something coming out of an area that we're operating in,"" Mattis said. 
""What this is designed to do is to make sure that the people we have fighting down in the (middle Euphrates River Valley) are not drawn off that fight, that we can crush what's left of the geographic caliphate,"" Mattis said, referring to areas controlled by Islamic state.
Turkey has been infuriated with Washington's support for the YPG, which it views as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) waging a decades-long insurgency on Turkish soil.
Islamic State is still present in eastern Syria in a pocket east of the Euphrates River near the border with Iraq.

President Donald Trump's administration hopes that the U.S.-backed fight against Islamic State in its last foothold in northeastern Syria will end within months but a top U.S. diplomat recently said American forces will remain to ensure the ""enduring defeat"" of the militant group.

Asked in an interview by CNBC about a Reuters report that members of the royal family are discussing the possibility of changing the line of succession, but not while King Salman is alive, Adel al-Jubeir said:
""These are outrageous comments that are being made and are totally unacceptable."" 
In a statement Reuters said: “We stand by our story.”
Reuters had quoted three sources close to the royal court as saying that amid international uproar over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, some members of Saudi Arabia's ruling family are agitating to prevent Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman from becoming king. 
""The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is unified on this issue, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is committed to its leadership, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is committed to the vision that our leaders have put forth for us in terms of Vision 2030 and in terms of moving along the path of reform,"" Jubeir said.
The killing of Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the crown prince, in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month has drawn global condemnation, including from many politicians and officials in the United States, a key Saudi ally. 
The CIA believes the crown prince ordered the killing, according to U.S. sources familiar with the assessment. President Donald Trump vowed on Tuesday to remain a “steadfast partner” of Saudi Arabia despite saying that Prince Mohammed may have known about the plan to murder Khashoggi.

""We have made it very clear that Saudi Arabia's government is not involved in this (Khashoggi's murder) and the crown prince is not involved in this, at all,"" Jubeir told CNBC.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. government agency said on Wednesday that abortion rates among American women of all ages fell to a decade low in 2015, which both opponents and supporters of abortion rights attributed in part to individual states' efforts to restrict women's access to the procedure.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that statistics for 2015, the most recent year for which data is available, show the abortion rate was 11.8 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44. That is down 26 percent from 2006, when the study began and the rate was 15.9 abortions per 1,000 women.
Teens aged 15 to 19 experienced a greater decrease than older women, with the rate falling 54 percent from 2006 to 2015, the CDC said.
""This decrease in abortion rate was greater than the decreases for women in any older age group,"" the CDC said in a statement.
The CDC did not provide any reason for the decline, but abortion rights advocates attributed it to increased use of contraceptives as well as decreased access to abortion services in some states.
""Affordable access to the full range of contraception and family planning options is critical for people deciding if and when they'd like to become parents, develop their careers, plan for their futures and manage their health,"" said Rachel Jones, research scientist at Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health think tank that supports abortion rights.
Opponents of abortion rights said the decrease was primarily the result of many states' efforts to restrict women's access to the procedure.
""That is due, in a significant way, to pro-life legislation that seeks to provide life-affirming solutions to abortion, combined with pro-life efforts that educate Americans about the effects of abortion and the humanity of the unborn child,"" Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee, said in an email.
The total number of reported abortions fell to 638,169 in 2015, from 842,855 in 2006, a 24 percent decrease. In 2015, there were 188 abortions per 1,000 live births, compared with 233 abortions per 1,000 live births in 2006, a drop of 19 percent.
In 2015, all measures reached their lowest level for the entire period of analysis from 2006 to 2015, the CDC said of the annual study, ""Abortion Surveillance - United States 2015.""
Conservative state lawmakers are passing increasingly restrictive abortion laws in a challenge to Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 landmark decision that established that women have a constitutional right to an abortion.
The Republican-controlled Ohio House of Representatives last week approved a measure that would ban abortions at six weeks, while an Iowa law banning abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected is tied up in a court battle. [L2N1XW020]
Such laws are designed to end up before the Supreme Court, which has become more conservative following President Donald Trump's appointments of Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.

The CDC study also showed 91.1 percent of abortions performed in 2015 were in a woman's first 13 weeks of pregnancy. There was also a shift toward earlier abortions, with the number performed at six weeks or less increasing 11 percent.

802,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2018 02:40PM ET</span>","Iraq to unify customs procedures with Kurdistan, PM says","By Ahmed Rasheed
BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq will unify customs procedures in all of its border areas, including within semi-autonomous Kurdistan, the prime minister said on Wednesday, signaling a further thaw in ties between Baghdad and Erbil after a resumption of Kirkuk oil flows.
The decision will be implemented after the federal government in Baghdad reaches an agreement on the move with the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi told a news conference. 
He said the unified procedures would make it easier to transport imported goods and commodities.
Currently, the KRG independently imposes and collects custom tariffs on imported goods in border areas it controls, which Baghdad considers illegal. 
Baghdad in turn imposes more tariffs of its own on commodities coming in from Kurdish-controlled border areas and the double customs have been seen as a burden by traders.
Abdel Mahdi said he would meet Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani, who is set to visit Baghdad, on Thursday. Barzani resigned as the region's president following a failed bid for independence but remains the leader of its largest party. 
Barzani, still one of the most influential Kurdish politicians in Iraq, has not visited Baghdad since before the referendum, which took place in September 2017.
""I will meet Barzani tomorrow on relations between Erbil and Baghdad to discuss key issues that will strengthen relations between Erbil and Baghdad. We want to help the region and its citizens,"" Abdul Mahdi said.
""I don't think we'll discuss oil ... It's a shame that the pumping of oil from Kirkuk stopped especially when these fields boost our federal revenues,"" he added.
Iraq on Friday restarted exports of Kirkuk oil, halted a year ago due to a standoff with Erbil following the referendum.
Exports had been on hold since Iraqi government forces retook Kirkuk from Kurdish authorities in 2017. The Kurds had taken control of Kirkuk and its oilfields after Islamic State militants drove the Iraqi army out in 2014, and Kurdish forces, in turn, ejected the militants.
Flows resumed at a modest level of around 50,000-60,000 barrels per day (bpd) compared with a peak of 300,000 bpd seen last year.
Abdul Mahdi said he would go to parliament next week to get his full cabinet approved. Lawmakers had only confirmed 14 out of the 22 ministers he initially presented but granted his government confidence, allowing him to become prime minister.

""Next week, Monday or Tuesday, we'll go to parliament and present what we see as the right candidates to complete the cabinet. We take responsibility for whoever is selected.""

""Look forward to seeing Brazil’s next President @JairBolsonaro in Rio on November 29th. We share many bilateral interests and will work closely on expanding freedom and prosperity throughout the Western Hemisphere,"" Bolton wrote on Twitter.
Bolsonaro, a former Army captain, said after winning Brazil's presidential election last month that he planned to visit Washington after a friendly call with U.S. President Donald Trump.
Trump said he had an ""excellent call"" congratulating Bolsonaro and tweeted about their plans to ""work closely together on trade, military and everything else!""
The president-elect, who nearly died from a stab wound received on the campaign trail, said last week he would likely skip the G-20 summit in Buenos Aires set for Nov. 30 and Dec. 1 because of his poor health. Trump is due to attend the summit.
Bolsonaro, who takes office on Jan. 1, was invited by Brazilian President Michel Temer to accompany him to the gathering as part of the transition to the new government.

Bolsonaro's election cheered investors, but alarmed critics around the globe given his defense of Brazil's 1964-1985 military dictatorship, vows to sweep away leftist political opponents, and a track record of denigrating comments about gay people, women and minorities.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - South Korea's  S-Oil Corp  (KS:010950), Hyundai Oilbank Co [INPTVH.UL] and Jier Shin Korea Co took part in a bid-rigging scheme that led to more than $100 million in overcharges to the U.S. military, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter.
The three companies were not named in filings in U.S. federal court in Ohio that described a conspiracy that involved a total of six companies that overcharged U.S. military bases in South Korea for fuel.
The South Korea bid-rigging investigation is part of a more aggressive effort by the U.S. Justice Department to crack down on companies that defraud the U.S. government on military contracts.
The court papers filed by U.S. Justice Department after it settled with three other companies last month named SK Energy Co Ltd[SKENGG.UL]; GS Caltex Corp [GSCAL.UL], 50 percent owned by  Chevron  (N:CVX); and Hanjin Transportation Co Ltd (KS:002320). They agreed to pay a total of $236 million in criminal fines and civil damages.
The Justice Department estimated that the bid rigging occurred from about 2005 to 2016. The government procurement data site GovTribe said that between 2008 and 2013 the major sellers of fuel to U.S. military bases in South Korea were S-Oil, GS Caltex, SK Energy, Hanjin, Hyundai Oilbank and Jier Shin Korea.
S-Oil Corp said through a spokesperson that it was ""unaware of any investigation."" S-Oil is partially owned by Aramco Overseas, according to both Aramco's and S-Oil's web sites.
A spokesperson for Hyundai Oilbank acknowledged that it was under investigation but declined further comment. A Jier Shin Korea spokesperson also was ""unaware of such investigation.""
Court filings which accompanied the Justice Department settlement with SK Energy, GS Caltex and Hanjin this month referred to other companies involved in the probe as Company A and Company C, both oil companies, and Company B, a logistics firm.
The sources, who were not authorized to speak on the record, identified S-Oil and Hyundai as the oil companies and Jier Shin as the logistics company.
The U.S. military had a budget of about $700 billion in the 2018 fiscal year, which ended on September 30.
A large proportion of the budget is spent in South Korea where the United States has kept a military presence in the divided peninsula since the 1950-1953 war. There are currently more than 28,000 troops in South Korea. Camp Humphreys south of Seoul is the largest U.S. overseas base with nearly 20,000 U.S. personnel.
Following the settlement announced last week, Makan Delrahim, head of the U.S. Justice Department's antitrust division, said that the department planned to be more aggressive in pressing antitrust charges against companies that rigged bids for contracts to supply the government.
In addition to scrutinizing mergers to make sure they comply with antitrust law, the Justice Department investigates and charges companies that are supposed to compete but who conspire to raise prices. 

The bid-rigging came to light because of a whistleblower, according to a lawyer for the whistleblower, Eric Havian of Constantine Cannon.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Wednesday that peace talks between Yemen's warring parties are likely to take place in early December in Sweden.
Western countries are pressing for a ceasefire and renewed peace efforts to end the more than three-year long conflict, which is seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Yemen. 
A Saudi-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Iran-allied Houthi group. The Houthis now rule most of Yemen's population, while the exiled government controls a section of the south.
U.N. Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths told the Security Council on Friday that Yemen's parties have given ""firm assurances"" they are committed to attending peace talks he hopes to convene in Sweden before the end of the year.
""It looks like very, very early in December, up in Sweden we'll see both the Houthi rebel side and the U.N recognized government,"" Mattis told reporters.
An attempt to hold peace talks in Geneva in September was abandoned after three days of waiting for the Houthi delegation. 
Mattis also said Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates had ceased offensive operations around Yemen's key port city of Hodeidah and despite some fighting, the front lines had not changed in at least 72 hours.
Griffiths was in Yemen's capital Sanaa on Wednesday and was due to visit Hodeidah on Thursday, United Nations spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. Hodeidah port handles 80 percent of the country's food imports and aid supplies. 
""He seeks to finalize the arrangements in the lead-up to the talks in Sweden and to revisit a U.N. supervisory role for the port and to draw attention to the continued need for a pause in the fighting,"" Dujarric said. 
Yemen's economy is in crisis and three-quarters of its population, or 22 million people, require aid. Some 8.4 million are on the brink of starvation, though the U.N. has warned that will likely rise to 14 million.

U.N. food chief David Beasley visited Hodeidah last week and told reporters in New York on Friday the United Nations was ""prepared, if necessary, if all parties desire"" to take over the operational capacity of the port.

More than six months since parliamentary elections, Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri has hit a wall in his effort to form a national unity government as political factions jostle for positions in the new cabinet.
A new government must be in place before Lebanon embarks on major fiscal reform, which the International Monetary Fund said in June is urgently needed to put the country's debt on a sustainable footing.
""Lebanon today is experiencing a government formation crisis ... Lebanon no longer has the luxury of wasting time,"" Aoun said in a televised speech on the eve of the country's 75th independence day since the French mandate ended in 1943.

Stressing that tackling the economy is a priority, Aoun called on all officials and parties in Lebanon to set aside personal interests and work responsibly for the Lebanese people.

808,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2018 11:58AM ET</span>","More than 80,000 Yemeni children may have died from hunger, aid group says","By Aziz El Yaakoubi and Mohammed Ghobari
DUBAI/ADEN (Reuters) - An estimated 85,000 children under five may have died from extreme hunger in Yemen since a Saudi-led coalition intervened in the civil war in 2015, an aid agency said on Wednesday, as the U.N. special envoy arrived in Yemen to pursue peace talks.
Western countries are pressing for a ceasefire and renewed peace efforts to end the disastrous conflict, which has unleashed the world’s most urgent humanitarian crisis with 8.4 million people believed to be on the verge of starvation.
Save the Children said that a conservative estimate based on U.N. data showed 84,700 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition may have died between April 2015 and October 2018, when a Western-backed Arab alliance has been battling the Iran-aligned Houthi movement that holds the capital Sanaa.
    ""We are horrified that some 85,000 children in Yemen may have died because of the consequences of extreme hunger since the war began. For every child killed by bombs and bullets, dozens are dying from hunger and disease and it's entirely preventable,"" it said in a statement.
    The last available figure from the United Nations for the death toll from the conflict, seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, was in 2016 and stood at more than 10,000. 
The world body has not provided figures for the death toll from malnutrition but warned last month that half the population, or some 14 million people, could soon be on the brink of famine and completely reliant on humanitarian aid.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it had no fatality figures but both malnutrition and fighting were taking a heavy toll on civilians.
""What we see in all the different (health) centers and places that we are working in, it's a very catastrophic humanitarian situation, but not only malnutrition,"" Carlos Batallas, outgoing head of the ICRC delegation in Aden, told Reuters in Geneva.
""One of the problems that we are seeing today is that vaccination has not been followed through, that you have pregnant women that have no pre-natal care, women that cannot deliver kids at hospitals or a health center with nurses.""
The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), a database that tracks violence in Yemen, says around 57,000 people have been reported killed since the beginning of 2016.
The Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 to restore the government that was ousted from Sanaa in 2014 by the Houthis, who control most population centers.
Since seizing the southern port city of Aden in 2015, the Arab coalition has faced a military stalemate and has been focusing on wresting control of the main port city of Hodeidah to weaken the Houthis by cutting off their main supply line.
NO CEASEFIRE YET
So far there has been no halt to fighting in Hodeidah, despite an announcement by the coalition last week that it would stop military operations there. A few days later the Houthis announced a halt to missile and drone attacks on coalition leaders Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and their Yemeni allies.
Intense fighting in the past two days has taken place in Hodeidah mostly at night, as each side tried to reinforce its positions during the de-escalation in hostilities.
""Loud bangs, shelling and gunfire could be heard all over the city until dawn,"" a Hodeidah resident said on Wednesday.
The medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres said fighting was moving closer to a hospital where its staff operate.
""Our staff can hear explosions and shootings occurring extremely close by every day around Al-Salakhana hospital,"" its operations manager for Yemen said in a statement.
A pro-coalition Yemeni military source told Reuters on Monday that a ceasefire in Hodeidah would start only after the U.N. Security Council passes a British-drafted resolution on Yemen. Aid groups fear an all-out assault on the city, entry point for more than 80 percent of Yemen's food imports, would unleash famine. 
U.N. envoy Martin Griffiths arrived in Sanaa on Wednesday to meet with Houthi leaders to discuss convening peace talks in Sweden next month. The Houthis failed to show up to peace talks in September. Kuwait has offered to provide planes for the parties to ensure the participation of both sides in Stockholm. 
Griffiths faces a daunting challenge to overcome deep mistrust between all sides. A draft resolution, seen by Reuters, calls for a halt to fighting in Hodeidah, a stop to attacks on populated areas across Yemen and an end to attacks on countries in the region.
It also calls for an unhindered flow of commercial and humanitarian goods, and a large, fast injection of foreign currency into the economy through the central bank.

""We are hoping that these peace conversations in Sweden next month will provide a ceasefire, will provide confidence-building measures. That we will have more possibilities for humanitarian organizations and for the population to start to move, to start to regain a normal life,"" ICRC's Batallas said.

809,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2018 11:56AM ET</span>",Terror of gang violence drives migrant caravans northward,"By Delphine Schrank and Goran Tomasevic
PUERTO CORTES PRISON, Honduras/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Former Honduran policeman Ivan says he moved homes so many times to escape the street gangs that terrorize his Central American country that he lost count. Fearful his sons would have to join the gangs or be killed, he eventually joined thousands of Hondurans fleeing to the United States. 
    The 45-year-old, who asked to be identified only by his first name, is journeying through Mexico in a caravan of several thousand mostly Honduran migrants who are fleeing violence and poverty for a better life in the United States. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has declared the caravans an ""invasion,"" and has sent some 5,800 troops to ""harden"" the border, including with barbed wire.
    Ivan, fearful to tell his story, is watchful for gang tattoos or slang that might suggest fellow migrants were associated with his persecutors back home. 
The former policemen said the final straw in Honduras came when gang members put a gun to his 15-year-old son Yostin's head.
    They wanted Yostin and younger brother Julio, 13, to join them, threatening death if they refused, Ivan said during a break in the caravan's northward journey at a temporary camp in a Mexico City stadium.
    So when a caravan set off on Oct. 13 from the crime-racked Honduran city of San Pedro Sula, where the family was hiding with friends, they never hesitated. Reuters was not able to independently verify their story. 
    However, their motives echo others in the caravan and are a reminder of the influence the gangs called 'maras' wield across El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala despite almost 20 years of efforts to crush them.
    Homicide rates have fallen in Honduras since 2016, as a consequence of initiatives that include prison reform, the creation of a specialized anti-gang security force, and increased resources for law enforcement.
In 2017 there were 42 murders per 100,000 residents in Honduras, compared to 57 per 100,000 in the prior year, according to statistics from the government and the World Bank. 
Still, the murder rate in Honduras remains one of the highest in the world. Some international aid organizations such as the Norwegian Refugee Council operate in the country with the same precautions as in war zones, and say inhabitants face the same dangers. 
At the U.S. border barbed wire laid by soldiers deployed by Trump awaits the caravan to dissuade the migrants from crossing illegally. New rules curtailing asylum claims also increase the chances they will be deported.
    A return home terrifies many, including Ivan. Removed from his job of 27 years in a police purge two years ago, he says he fears death in Honduras. 
    The purge removed more than 4,000 officers, or close to a third of what is currently a 14,000 strong force, according to Commissioner Jair Meza, spokesperson for the Honduran Security Ministry.
Ivan says the purge removed good police as well as bad, while leaving the former officers exposed to revenge attacks from gangs they once pursued.
    ""They know us and so they hunt us down,"" he said.
Meza said police who were removed were subject to polygraph tests and background checks before being selected. Age and performance were other considerations.
    RANDOM VIOLENCE
In Honduras, violence can strike at any time. 
On the cocaine transit corridor to the nearby port of Puerto Cortes, San Pedro Sula was for years one of the world's most dangerous cities. Its morgue was so full of corpses that locals said their smell permeated the streets.
    On a night in late July, a family sat on the side of a highway in San Pedro Sula, a few feet from a crime scene.
    Fransisca Sislavas waited stone-faced between her son, Rony, 2, and her daughter, Brittany, 4. The girl's ankle was splattered with her father's blood. 
    Minutes earlier, Sislavas had been sitting beside her partner and their children in a taxi. She struggled to explain his death. 
    ""I don't know. Why? How? I just don't know,"" she said.
               
    ""BETRAYED BY LIFE""
    For some Hondurans who fail in their pursuit of the American Dream, deportation can mean an entrance into gang life.
    Henry Fernando, an active member of MS-13, also known as Mara Salvatrucha, said he walked more than 3,000 miles and almost died in the desert crossing from Mexico to find his mother, who had left him for Virginia.
    Quickly deported, MS-13 was the only home he found, he said, recalling the girlfriends, or ""jainas"", that leaders offered, serving as payment for the marijuana and crack cocaine he sold. Reuters was not able to independently verify his story. 
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it was unable to trace Fernando's deportation based on the information Reuters was able to provide.
Nine years later, now 28, he has a young son, and dreams of leaving the gang. His home, visited by Reuters, was a rented room barely wider than his mattress, up a rickety ladder in the middle of a pigsty. He had moved up the MS-13 ranks, but remains mired in poverty.
Fifteen people interviewed by Reuters, either active in the gangs or in stages of reforming, described only two ways out: join an Evangelical church or death. 
    All of them said they joined the gangs as boys from broken homes in broken neighborhoods.
    Ramon Bladimir Funes, 35, a member of Barrio-18 has served nearly three years in Puerto Cortes jail for robbery in jail. The overcrowded, lurid-green facility lies near the northern Honduran port.
    Among the jail's older inmates, Funes had joined Barrio-18 at 9 years old, after his mother abandoned him for the United States, he said. He only met his father at 17.
    Signs of his gang years were tattooed on his arms and across his chest. Down the bridge of his nose were three tears, gang code for lost loved ones. Three of Funes' sons were killed by Barrio 18's arch-rival MS-13. 
    ""You aspire to higher ideas and a higher mindset, but you're stuck in the problems of the street,"" said Funes, who regrets joining Barrio 18. ""And weapons, all types, are so easy to find.""

810,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2018 11:47AM ET</span>",Egyptians kidnapped by Libyan gunmen over business dispute: residents,"AL-HERDA, Egypt (Reuters) - Armed men in an eastern Libyan city have kidnapped 16 Egyptian workers over a financial dispute between Libyan contractors and their Egyptian partner, residents of the workers' home village said.
The incident revived concerns over the fate of thousands of Egyptians, most of them working as cheap labourers, in Libya -- a country torn by lawlessness since Western-backed rebels toppled Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.
Egyptian officials were not immediately available to comment.
Residents of the small village which the kidnapped workers came from -- Al-Herda in the Nile Delta province of Kafr el-Sheikh -- said that three of the hostages had escaped their captors but their whereabouts were not known.
The workers were seized four days ago in the city of Tobruk, on Libya's eastern Mediterranean coast by unknown gunmen after Libyan contractors accused a business partner from the same Egyptian village as the kidnapped men of fleeing the country after he stole 100,000 Libyan dinars ($72,000).
The kidnappers have told the village residents through mediators that the men would be freed once the Egyptian businessman returned the money, residents said.
One resident said the kidnappers have threatened to take unspecified action against the hostages if the money was not paid.
""The Libyan side said he wants his money before letting the men go,"" the resident, who asked not to be identified, said. He said the kidnappers have said they would deliver the men to Egypt's land border crossing with Libya at Salloum once the money was paid.
Thousands of Egyptians, most driven by lack of jobs, have sought work in Libya since 2011, risking their lives in a country where Islamist militants and militias largely rule.
One resident of the Egyptian village said his brother paid 7,000 Egyptian pounds ($390) to smugglers who helped him reach Libya through desert roads.
""I am now worried about my brother's life because killing in Libya has become a common practice,"" the man who asked not to be identified, said.
One of the kidnapped men, Hasanat Mostafa, had traveled to Libya to help pay for a house he is building in his native Herda.
""We all depend on him, his father is ill,"" his mother said.
Asked what needed to be done for her son, she said: ""I want him to come back. The government should intervene and President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi should intervene.""
In 2015, Islamic State militants killed 20 Egyptian Christians who were kidnapped while working in Libya.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Endemic violence in Central African Republic is pushing the country towards famine with 63 percent of the population already needing emergency aid, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in the country said on Wednesday.
Central African Republic (CAR) has been in chaos since 2013, when mainly Muslim Seleka rebels ousted the president, provoking a backlash from Christian anti-balaka militias.
The fighting has uprooted more than 1 million people. The U.N. humanitarian chief in the country, Najat Rochdi, said 2.9 million of the 4.6 million population needed aid, and 1.6 million were in acute need. 
In August, a food security survey assessed that for the first time, parts of CAR were in an ""emergency"". That is the level four in a globally recognized food security classification system, where five is ""catastrophe/famine"".
""If the situation is remaining the same and people are not going back to work their fields... it means that, yes, in a very few years we will have a famine in Central African Republic,"" Rochdi told reporters in Geneva. 
Such a catastrophic scenario would not arise immediately, but could threaten hundreds of thousands, she said.
Violence has continued in the south and east, and Rochdi said the United Nations had had to act as a government to keep basic services running. Part of her job was identifying areas that were now stable enough to hand over to local officials, so U.N. staff could be freed up for more urgent work.
People uprooted in CAR include 620,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) and 570,000 refugees in neighboring countries, mostly in Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Chad.
In some areas, security was improving, allowing displaced people to come home and aid workers to get unaccustomed access.
But in other areas, attacks on IDP sites was putting things ""back to square one"", Rochdi said. 
IDP camps at Batangafo in the northwest and Alindao in the south had been torched, obliterating years of work and leaving tens of thousands of people with absolutely nothing.
Rochdi said that although the residents of both camps were Christian, it was simplistic to see it as Muslim-on-Christian violence, since Muslim and Christian militias were involved in both attacks. 
Ordinary people never talked about hating Christians or Muslims, and just wanted to live in peace, but the armed groups often justify their actions as vengeance for killings of particular groups, producing an endless spiral of violence.

CHICO, Calif. (Reuters) - Heavy rains expected on Wednesday in northern California are expected to hinder search teams sifting through ash and rubble for the remains of victims of the deadliest wildfire in the state's history, as well as bring more misery to evacuees who have yet to find permanent shelter. 
As much as nearly eight inches (20 cm) of rain is forecast to fall by Friday in areas around the town of Paradise, a community of nearly 27,000 people 175 miles (280 kilometers) northeast of San Francisco that was largely incinerated by the Camp Fire. The blaze killed at least 81 people and left hundreds missing.
The storm will help firefighters still battling the fire but will create more suffering for many residents left homeless by the disaster. Some of the homeless, whose numbers have not been determined, are camping out rather than staying in emergency shelters.
Kelly Boyer, who lost his home in Paradise, has been sharing a tent with a friend at an encampment outside a Walmart (NYSE:WMT) store in nearby Chico, where overnight low temperatures have fallen to just above freezing. 
Boyer has received wooden pallets and plastic tarps donated by local residents to keep his tent off the ground and dry, but he said the rain would still make a mess.
""It's going to be mud city,"" he told Reuters.
Forecasters said the rains, which in some areas are likely to be accompanied by winds of up to 45 miles per hour, might also cause rivers of mud and debris to slide down flame-scorched slopes stripped of vegetation. The fire has burned across 151,000 acres (61,000 hectares) of the Sierra foothills.
Mass evacuations since the fire erupted on Nov. 8 have, however, removed most people from harm's way from any debris flow, according to National Weather Service (NWS) hydrologist Cindy Matthews.
She also said the volcanic soil and relatively shallow slopes in the fire zone mean the ground is unlikely to become saturated enough for hillsides to give way to landslides.
Authorities in Southern (NYSE:SO) California, though, warned residents in areas burned by wildfires in the foothills and mountains northwest of Los Angeles of mud-flow hazards from rain this week. One of those blazes, the Woolsey Fire, killed three people.
Evacuees also face increasingly chilly weather.
""It's real cold at night,"" evacuee Mark Kempton told KRCR TV. He said he was going to sleep in his car instead of a tent to stay warm. 
MORE VICTIMS
The remains of two more victims were found in Paradise on Tuesday, raising the death toll to 81. The Butte County Sheriff's Office has tentatively identified 56 of the victims.
A missing-persons list compiled by the sheriff's office was revised downward to 699 names on Tuesday from a high of more than 1,200 over the weekend.
The number has fluctuated widely over the past week as more individuals were reported missing and some initially unaccounted for either turned up alive or were confirmed dead.
Ron Zimmer, a pastor at East Avenue Community Church in Chico, which has sheltered evacuees, told KRCR TV the sheriff's office had called asking him to ""look at all the names (on the list of missing) and cross reference them."" 
His church located 12 people on the list who had escaped the fire but had been listed as unaccounted for.
The number of residents needing temporary shelter was unclear, but as many as 52,000 people were under evacuation orders at the height of the firestorm last week.
The Camp Fire incinerated some 12,600 homes in and around Paradise, mostly during the first night of the blaze. Gale-force winds drove flames through the town with little warning, forcing residents to flee for their lives.
Buffer lines have been carved around 75 percent of the fire's perimeter and full containment is expected by the end of the month.
Smoke from the fires has drifted across the country to the East Coast, where it left a brownish-orange haze that was credited with unusually vibrant sunsets on Monday.

The cause of the Camp and Woolsey fires is under investigation, but electric utilities reported equipment problems around the time both blazes broke out.

More than 240 people, most of them unarmed civilians, were killed on the night of July 15, 2016, when a group of rogue soldiers commandeered tanks and warplanes in a botched attempt to overthrow President Tayyip Erdogan. 
Turkey blames U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen for the abortive putsch and has carried out a widespread crackdown on his suspected supporters, detaining some 160,000 people, including academics, soldiers and civil servants.
Of those, 77,000 have been formally charged and kept in jail during trial, according to the interior minister.
On Wednesday, the court sentenced the 74 defendants to aggregated life sentences for ""attempting to disrupt the constitutional order"", Anadolu said. 
Aggravated life sentences are subject to a harsher regime in prison, and are not eligible for parole or general amnesty. 
It was not immediately clear how many soldiers were among the group sentenced.
Rights groups and Turkey's Western allies have voiced concern about the scope of the purges, saying Erdogan had used the coup as a pretext to quash dissent.
The government, however, says the measures are necessary due to the gravity of the threats it is facing.

Iranian Foreign Ministry officials voiced more hope for the move a day after Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif cast doubt on it, saying European powers were struggling to set up a ""Special Purpose Vehicle"" (SPV) trade mechanism.
European diplomats said last week British, French and German attempts to establish the SPV were faltering because no EU country was willing to host it for fear of its banks provoking U.S. penalties, including a ban from U.S. markets. 
In May, President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from world powers' 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran, under which Tehran curbed its disputed uranium enrichment program in exchange for the lifting of most international sanctions. Trump has since reimposed U.S. sanctions targeting Iran's oil exports.
The three big European Union powers and the EU as a whole have reaffirmed their commitment to the nuclear deal, as have Russia and China. Iran has warned it could repudiate the deal unless its economic benefits are preserved. 
""We had constructive meetings with British and French officials and nuclear negotiators in Tehran yesterday and today,"" Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said in a tweet on Wednesday, referring to British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt's visit to Tehran.
A French delegation was also in Tehran to meet Araqchi on Wednesday, the semi-official Fars news agency said.
""The European Union and the three European countries are still determined to save the JCPOA (nuclear deal). New initiatives are being designed for the SPV,"" Araqchi said.
The SPV is a sort of clearing house that could help match Iranian oil and gas exports against purchases of EU goods in an effective barter arrangement circumventing U.S. sanctions that are based on global use of the dollar for oil sales.
The Iranian foreign ministry spokesman said that Iran had not given up hope on the SPV, and denied reports that Tehran was preparing to withdraw from the nuclear deal.
""We have not been able yet to finalise the (SPV) issue to facilitate Iran's purchase of essential goods, and business with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs),"" Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by semi-official news agency ISNA.
""But we are not in a state to be totally disappointed with the European Union."" 
The U.S. special envoy for Iran warned last week that European banks and firms who engage in the SPV will be at risk from fresh U.S. sanctions.

817,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2018 09:45AM ET</span>",Bangladesh clothing factories face squeeze if safety push blocked,"By Emma Thomasson and Ruma Paul
BERLIN/DHAKA (Reuters) - A group set up to improve safety in Bangladesh's garment industry after the Rana Plaza disaster in 2013 is warning global fashion firms that they will have to stop sourcing from some factories if the watchdog is forced to close next week.
The threat to the apparel sector, which accounts for the bulk of Bangladesh's exports, comes at a precarious time for the country ahead of a bitterly contested election in December, when Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is seeking another term.
""The consequences of a closure of the Accord liaison office in Bangladesh will be significant, immediate, and damaging,"" said Joris Oldenziel, the deputy director of the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh.
More than 200 firms - including the world's top fashion retailers like Zara-owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX) and H&M (ST:HMb) - signed the legally-binding, five-year Accord after at least 1,100 people were killed when the Rana Plaza complex collapsed.
Bangladesh's government had agreed to allow the body an extension to complete remaining safety fixes and help build up a national regulatory body to take over the Accord's work. However, the High Court ordered it to close on Nov. 30
""The premature shut down of the Accord, leaving workers in unsafe circumstances, would jeopardize the brands’ ability to source from a safe industry,"" Oldenziel told Reuters.
Low wages have helped Bangladesh build the world's second-largest garment industry after China, with 4,000 factories employing about 4 million workers. The sector exports more than $30 billion worth of clothes a year, mainly to the United States and Europe.
Fashion group Esprit (HK:0330), which produces about a third of its garments in Bangladesh, has written to its factories in the country to say that the closure of the Accord's office in Dhaka will undermine the reputation of the textile industry.
""Activism in key market countries could make the Bangladesh brand toxic to consumers in spite of the tremendous improvements that we have achieved in recent years,"" Luis Gonzaga, Esprit's head of global supply, said in the letter to suppliers.
FACTORIES AT RISK
The Accord has inspected more than 2,000 factories in Bangladesh and helped draw up plans to fix 150,000 structural and fire hazards. Some 90 percent of those issues have since been addressed, although many that remain are major problems.
The Bangladeshi High Court has ordered the Accord's Dhaka office to close due to a complaint from a factory owner who was prevented from working with Accord brands after he was accused of falsifying test results on concrete strength in his building.
The Accord will keep operating from the Netherlands and remains legally binding on its member companies, but it has warned signatories they may have to stop sourcing from about 500 factories with safety problems if it can no longer inspect them.
The Accord and its signatory firms, along with European politicians and campaign groups, have been lobbying the Bangladesh government for help to lift the court order, but with little effect so far.
""We don’t need them anymore,"" said Bangladesh’s Commerce Minister Tofail Ahmed, adding that the government is capable of monitoring factories itself and noting that there is no such international oversight in countries like China or India.
However, many experts and campaigners say the Bangladesh regulatory body is not yet ready to take over. Some question whether it will ever be effective given endemic corruption in a country where many politicians also own garment factories.
""If they go, Bangladesh’s garment industry will go back to square one. Workers’ rights and safety will not be protected,"" said Babul Akhter, president of the Bangladesh Garment and Industrial Workers Federation.
Paul Barrett, deputy director for the Center for Business and Human Rights at the NYU Stern School of Business, said threats by retailers to move elsewhere might not be credible.
""I don't think the big Western brands want to leave. They've committed themselves to improving safety,"" he said. ""Various brands are exploring Ethiopia but there isn't the capacity to rival what goes on in Bangladesh.""
Sweden's H&M, one of the biggest buyers of garments in Bangladesh and the first Accord signatory, said it will keep up efforts to improve factory safety but will not pull out if the Accord has to close in Dhaka.

In a 116-62 vote, parliament backed Mariana Nikolova to replace Simeonov, one of the leaders of the United Patriots, an alliance of nationalist parties that together form the junior coalition partner in the 18-month-old government.
The opposition Socialists and ethnic Turkish MRF party voted against the appointment and called for an early election amid sporadic street protests over corruption, high fuel prices and low living standards in the European Union's poorest country.
""We do have a four-year governing program,"" and plan to raise spending on education and salaries, deputy leader of the ruling GERB party Tsetan Tsetanov told parliament. 
Support for Prime Minister Boyko Borissov's government has waned. The centre-right GERB party's lead over its main rivals, the Socialists, has narrowed to 1.3 percentage points, a public opinion survey by Trend pollster showed.
The average monthly salary in Bulgaria has increased by about 7 percent to 570 euros since Borissov's cabinet took office in May 2017, but remains among the lowest in the EU.
Nikolova's appointment was not backed by one of the three parties that make up United Patriots, highlighting tensions within the alliance that ensures Borissov's parliamentary majority.
Simeonov had apologized after referring to rights activists as ""shrill women"" and suggesting they were ""speculating"" about their children's health.

The bomb was the second to hit the capital in the space of a month, and was one of a series of attacks nationwide that began in mid-2015, at the start of around 1-1/2 years of heightened security threats from the Islamic State militant group and the separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) militia.
The court accused the defendants of being members of the PKK, considered a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. TAK, an offshoot of the PKK, claimed responsibility for the bombing.
Anadolu said 55 people had been on trial as part of the same case, all but eight of them in absentia.
Mehmet Veysi Dolasan was handed 37 aggravated life sentences for killing 36 people and damaging the unity of the state. 
Aggravated life sentences are subject to a harsher regime in prison, and are not eligible for parole or general amnesty.
Dolasan was also given more than 10,275 years in jail for the attempted murder of 342 people and transporting explosives. It was not clear why the number of victims differed slightly from the official toll of wounded.
Two others also received aggravated life sentences and additional jail time for transporting explosives and damaging the unity of the state, Anadolu said.
Six other defendants were handed varying jail terms short of life, while seven were acquitted. The cases of some other defendants were split off at the end of the trial.

821,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2018 08:15AM ET</span>",Turkey's long crackdown casts shadow over EU meeting,"By Tulay Karadeniz and Can Sezer
ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish police came for Yigit Aksakoglu before dawn, waking his young family and detaining him with a dozen other academics and activists accused of fomenting mass protests to overthrow President Tayyip Erdogan's government.
Friday's arrests, days before Turkey holds talks with the European Union, caused alarm in the West and reinforced a belief that Ankara's long crackdown has crushed not just Erdogan's opponents but also Turkey's last hopes of joining the EU.
The EU Commission's foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini and the commissioner for candidate countries, Johannes Hahn, are expected to raise the issue of the activists during talks in Ankara on Thursday with Turkey's foreign minister.
Ankara still says EU membership is one of its top strategic goals, but Hahn has said several times it would be more honest to end the accession talks and try instead to forge an alternative partnership between Turkey and the union.
Opposition in the EU to Turkish membership has been strengthened by Ankara's clampdown on critics of Erdogan since a failed military coup in 2016 and by fears that Turkey is sliding deeper into one-man rule.
Aksakoglu's lawyer said he was one of 13 people detained on Friday, accused of supporting attempts by jailed businessman and rights advocate Osman Kavala to revive mass protests in Istanbul's Gezi Park in 2013 against Erdogan's rule.
Police rang on his door at 6 o'clock in the morning. ""Two officers dressed in special operations uniform, and half a dozen others in plain clothes entered the house and took Yigit to police headquarters,"" his lawyer Asli Kazan told Reuters.
He testified for 10 hours before he was formally arrested and sent to prison. The 12 others detained on Friday have been freed, but Aksakoglu is now in a solitary cell in Silivri prison near Istanbul, his lawyer said.
On the same day Aksakoglu was detained, Turkish media said that prosecutors ordered the arrest of 188 people, including 100 former air force personnel, over links to a U.S.-based cleric Ankara accuses of orchestrating the 2016 coup attempt.
Since the failed putsch more than 77,000 people have been jailed pending trial, and widespread arrests are still routine. Authorities have suspended or sacked 150,000 civil servants and military personnel. 
Last week Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told parliament almost a quarter of Turkey's career diplomats had been purged. In the same speech he said full EU membership remains ""an inseparable part of our future target for a modern Turkey that supports political and social change"". 
LONG ROAD AHEAD
Turkey says the scale of its crackdown is justified by the gravity of events on July 15, 2016, when rogue soldiers commandeered tanks, planes and helicopters, bombing parliament and government buildings in their attempt to seize power.
In July this year the government formally lifted a two-year state of emergency imposed after the coup, but critics say Erdogan has retained many of those powers under an executive presidency that came into effect when he won elections in June.
Relations with the EU's leading power Germany particularly suffered in the last two years. Berlin has condemned the crackdown, including arrests of dozens of German nationals. Erdogan compared the German government to Nazis.
As Turkey's relations with the United States plunged into crisis earlier this year, helping drive the lira into meltdown in August, Erdogan's government sought to rebuild bridges with Europe. He made a state visit to Germany in September, and the Netherlands agreed to normalise ties after a year-long standoff.
However an EU diplomat said any real improvement would take time: ""You can't just turn a switch. You have to put the train back on track towards better relations"".
Turkey has also taken small steps to reverse a damaging rift with the United States caused partly by the detention of U.S. citizens and consular staff.
A Turkish court ruling to free a detained U.S. pastor last month was praised by U.S. President Donald Trump and led both countries to lift symbolic sanctions against U.S. and Turkish government ministers.
But sharp differences over Syria, U.S. sanctions on Iran and plans by NATO member Turkey to buy a Russian missile defense system remain an obstacle to rebuilding trust with Washington.
An EU official, setting low expectations ahead of this week's talks in Ankara, said it was important to ""keep open channels of communication"" with Turkey.
Work towards EU visa liberalization for Turkish nationals has been slow, and even the modest goal of modernizing a customs deal remains blocked after EU member states said work should be suspended.
The EU official said their decision was linked to fears about rule of law and human rights in Turkey.
""We do understand the concerns of Turkey and we don't want to prevent Turkey from fighting terrorism,"" the EU official said. However ""if you lock up bloggers or journalists because of them saying something, then it becomes an issue.""

Alice Weidel's local party in the southern city on the shores of a lake of the same name is suspected of receiving a total 145,000 Swiss francs ($145,743.29) between July and September last year from a company based across the border in Switzerland.
German law prohibits parties from receiving donations from outside the European Union, of which Switzerland is not a member state. The donations were made shortly before Germany's national election last September, the spokesman said in a statement.
The development is a fresh setback for the anti-immigration AfD, which became Germany's largest opposition party after last September's national election but suffered lackluster results in two regional votes last month.
Given that Weidel is a lawmaker with impunity, prosecutors had to first notify her and the president of the Bundestag lower house before launching the investigation.
""The prosecutor's office in Constance has extended the investigation based on the intial suspicion of the violation of party law to include Alice Weidel,"" the prosector's office said in a statement.
Weidel acknowledged in a speech in parliament on Wednesday that her party had ""made mistakes in dealing with electioneering donations"" and said that all the funds had been returned to the Swiss firm.
A few other AfD members in Constance are also under investigation in the case.
Prosecutors started looking into the party's election financing after a media consortium alleged that Weidel had received donations from a Swiss firm last year.

The proposal of Adina Florea, a little-known prosecutor in the port town of Constanta, is part of a series of legal and personnel changes made by the ruling Social Democrats that are seen as threats to judicial independence and could further heighten European Union concerns about democratic values in some of its eastern member states.
Florea was not immediately available for comment on the decision by President Klaus Iohannis.
Earlier this month, the European Commission said that proposed changes to the judicial system and criminal code signaled a reversal of a decade of democratic and market reforms. 
The European Parliament also passed a non-binding resolution urging a greater fight against corruption, condemning police brutality during anti-graft protests and demanding an end to what it called the erosion of the rule of law.
The government's decision in February to remove Florea's predecessor, Laura Codruta Kovesi, brought thousands of protesters onto the streets. Kovesi had drawn praise at home and abroad for her efforts to convict high-level politicians, but the justice minister accused her of exceeding her authority. 
In October, the minister requested the dismissal of Prosecutor General Augustin Lazar on similar grounds.
Speaking before a judicial advisory panel in October, part of her nomination process, Florea said anti-corruption prosecutors should not investigate abuse of office cases, raising concerns among government critics. About a third of all cases handled by the elite unit deal with abuse of office. 
Anti-corruption prosecutors have convicted thousands of public officials, including lawmakers and ministers.
Among them is Social Democrat leader Liviu Dragnea who was sentenced to a two-year suspended jail sentence in a vote-rigging case. He was also sentenced to three and a half years in jail in a separate abuse of office case. He denies all charges and has appealed.
Transparency International ranks Romania as one of the EU's most corrupt states and Brussels has kept its justice system under special monitoring since it joined the bloc in 2007.

Under Romanian law, the president must sign off on petitions to dismiss chief prosecutors, which are requested by the justice minister and also need approval from a judicial watchdog. A Constitutional Court decision limits Iohannis' powers to assess the legality of the procedure.

PARIS (Reuters) - A rights group filed a lawsuit against Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan during his visit to France on Wednesday, accusing him of war crimes, complicity in torture and inhumane treatment in Yemen, a lawyer for the group said.
The complaint by the International Alliance for the Defence of Rights and Freedoms (AIDL) said Prince Mohammed, who is Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, is responsible for attacks that hit civilians.
""It's in this capacity that he has ordered bombings on Yemeni territory,"" said complaint filed on behalf of the AIDL, which is based in France.
There was no immediate response from the Crown Prince's court or the UAE government media office to an emailed request for comment.
Diplomatic efforts to halt the war in Yemen have proved unsuccessful and attempts by rights group's to hold the war's protagonists to account have gained little international traction so far. 
The complaint, filed in a Paris court, comes as pressure grows on French President Emmanuel Macron to curb arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which head a coalition fighting the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels who control most of northern Yemen and the capital Sanaa.
France also has a military base in Abu Dhabi. 
A number of Yemenis have joined the legal action, AIDL lawyer Joseph Breham said. 
Prince Mohammed, a close ally of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is due to have lunch with Macron on Wednesday.
French prosecutors are already studying a similar complaint filed in April against the Saudi crown prince, starting a legal process likely to last years.
The complaint against Abu Dhabi's crown prince cites a report by U.N. experts that said coalition attacks may have constituted war crimes and that torture was carried out in two centers controlled by Emirati forces.
The complaint makes reference to the bombing of a building in Sanaa in October, 2016, where a wake was taking place for the father of the Houthi administration’s interior minister.
The Yemen war has killed more than 10,000 people and forced from their homes more than 3 million - more than 10 percent of the population.
Documents from Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and Oxfam on arbitrary detentions and the use of illegal cluster bombs are also referenced in the complaint. 

The lawyers said French courts were competent to handle the case in line with the United Nations convention against torture.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - The top government official in the restive Araucania region of Chile resigned late on Tuesday amid mounting political fallout after a controversial police raid last week ended in the shooting of an indigenous Mapuche man.
Luis Mayol, the local intendent, or governor, of the Araucania region and a member of conservative President Sebastian Pinera's ruling coalition, resigned amid criticism of his handling of the incident. 
His exit comes one week after Camilo Catrillanca, the grandson of a local indigenous leader, was shot in the head during a police operation in a rural community near the town of Ercilla, 480 miles south of Santiago. [L2N1XQ0XM]
The incident sparked fury among opposition parties and human rights activists, and triggered widespread protests throughout Chile. [L2N1XU01U]
Mayol has been criticized for linking Catrillanca to recent car thefts by opposition lawmakers. He has since stood by his handling of the controversy. 
""I regret the pettiness and political smallness of [the opposition]...I leave my post knowing that I did nothing wrong,"" he told reporters late on Tuesday.
Chilean police initially said it was unclear who shot Catrillanca because none of the members of the special forces unit that handled the raid had worn body cameras.
But one of the policemen involved was later spotted in media footage wearing a camera. The policeman told investigators he had removed the camera's memory card following the raid and destroyed it with scissors.
Local prosecutors launched an investigation earlier this week at the behest of the Pinera administration to determine who shot Catrillanca, and why.
The shooting and revelations that followed have heightened tensions in the Araucania, a lush, rural region of rolling hills and snow-capped volcanoes that is also Chile's least developed province. 
The region's Mapuche indigenous residents accuse the state and private companies of taking their ancestral land, draining its natural resources, and using undue violence against them. Their communities are among the poorest in Chile.
President Pinera announced a $24 billion action plan in September to bring an end to the conflict by boosting infrastructure investment and support for local entrepreneurs and tourism, but fallout from the controversial raid threatens to slow progress.
In an interview with Reuters, Chile's Minister of Social Development Alfredo Moreno, who oversees the program, said the administration's plans would proceed. 
""I don't think they will be delayed. What we do need to do is work to rebuild dialogue in the region,"" he said.

The U.N. pact, to regulate the treatment of migrants worldwide, was approved in July by all 193 member states except the United States and is to be signed in Morocco next month. 
But Australia on Wednesday said it would not sign up to the pact, joining nations including Israel, Hungary and Austria who have said it would compromise immigration policy.
In an appeal to embrace a multilateral approach to the migrant issue, Merkel made a thinly veiled attack on U.S. President Donald Trump and her far-right opponents at home. 
""There are people who say they can solve everything themselves and don't have to think about anyone else, that is nationalism in its purest form,"" she told the Bundestag lower house of parliament in an unusually passionate address. 
Merkel, whose 13-year chancellorship has been marked by her open-door migrant policy, said the U.N. pact was in Germany's interests and would not infringe on national sovereignty.
The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration is a framework for cooperation and aims to reduce illegal migration, help integrate migrants and return them to their home countries. It asks backers to use detention only as a last resort. Impetus for the pact followed Europe's biggest influx of refugees and migrants since World War Two.
Some of Merkel's conservatives, notably Health Minister Jens Spahn who is standing to succeed her as head of the Christian Democrat party (CDU), have called for a broader debate before Germany signs up to the pact. Far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) lawmakers oppose it.
""This pact for migration, like the refugee pact, is the right attempt to find solutions for global problems internationally, together,"" Merkel said to heckles from the AfD.
She said in 2015 Germany realised that the problem of flight and migration had to be tackled at an international level, that ""no one country can do it alone"".

""The debate about a global pact for migration, for orderly, legal migration in a world where there are 222 violent conflicts ... 68.5 million refugees, 52 percent of whom are children, this organization plays a central role,"" she said.

ABU DHABI (Reuters) - A UAE court sentenced British academic Matthew Hedges to life in prison on charges of spying on Wednesday, according to his family and a court statement carried by state-run newspaper The National.
The hearing lasted less than five minutes and his lawyer was not present, his family said.
UK Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt said he was ""deeply shocked and disappointed"" by the verdict, adding that he had personally raised the case at the highest levels of the UAE government and that the verdict would hurt relations.
He said the handling of the case by Emirati authorities would have repercussions on relations between the two countries.
Hedges, a 31-year-old doctoral student at Durham University, has been held in the UAE since May 5, when he was arrested at Dubai International Airport after a two-week research visit.
""I am in complete shock and I don't know what to do. Matthew is innocent,"" said Hedges' wife, Daniela Tejada, who was present in the courtroom. A Reuters journalist was barred from entering, which was closed to the public.
A life sentence for a non-Emirati entails a maximum of 25 years in jail and is followed by deportation, according to The National. The court ruled that his devices and research would be confiscated, the newspaper reported.
Emirati authorities could not immediately be reached for comment.
Hedges was released on bail in late October, but had been held in solitary confinement for five months before that, his family said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's opposition Labour Party is in no rush to topple Prime Minister Theresa May's government over Brexit, the party's finance policy chief John McDonnell told Reuters on Wednesday.
McDonnell, the man who would become finance minister if Labour are able to capitalize on a crisis of confidence in May's leadership and form their own government, said the party wanted to first take a look at what more May can negotiate in Brussels.

""I can confirm that there are three scenarios on the table that we are looking at, we are making final adjustments and all will be presented next week,"" French Environment Minister Francois de Rugy told France Inter radio, without specifying a date.
The so-called PPE energy plan will lay out France's energy goals over the next 10 years with the aim of reducing the share of nuclear power in its energy mix to 50 percent from 75 percent by 2035, curb carbon emissions and boost renewables.
French news agency AFP reported on Tuesday, citing government working documents, that the government could shut down up to six nuclear reactors by 2028, including the planned closure of France's oldest Fessenheim nuclear plant which is scheduled to stop production in 2021, according to one scenario.
It said another six reactors could close by 2035, which could set France on the path to curb nuclear generation by 50 percent.
The second intermediate scenario does not foresee any additional closures beside Fessenheim until 2028, and then 12 reactors would be shutdown between 2028 and 2035, AFP quoted the document saying.
The final option would also see no additional closures until 2028 after which, only nine reactors would be halted by 2035, which could miss the 50 percent nuclear target.
Jefferies analysts, who have a ""buy"" rating on the shares of state-controlled utility EDF (PA:EDF), said in a research note that two out of the three options seem to favor EDF, which operates all of France's 58 nuclear reactors.
Even the accelerated nuclear phase-out option appears to offer some protection, via compensation, wrote Jefferies.

Trump vowed on Tuesday to remain a ""steadfast partner"" of Saudi Arabia, despite saying that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman may have known about the plan to murder to Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and Washington Post columnist.
Of the possibility Prince Mohammed had a hand in the murder, Trump said: ""Maybe he did, maybe he didn't"". His comments contradicted the CIA, which believes Khashoggi's death was ordered directly by the crown prince, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler.
Numan Kurtulmus, the deputy chairman of President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party, dismissed Trump's assessment. ""Yesterday's statement is a comic statement,"" he told state broadcaster TRT Haber.
""It is not possible for an intelligence agency such as the CIA, which even knows the color of the fur on the cat walking around the Saudi consulate's garden ... to not know who gave this order,"" he said. ""This is not credible either for U.S. public opinion or the world public opinion.""
Since Khashoggi's killing at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month, Turkey has repeatedly said the order came from the ""highest levels"" of the Saudi government, although it has not directly accused Prince Mohammed.
Saudi Arabia has denied that the crown prince ordered the killing. After offering numerous contradictory explanations, Riyadh said last week Khashoggi had been killed and his body dismembered when ""negotiations"" to persuade him to return to Saudi Arabia failed.
Trump said Saudi Arabia, a major oil producer, was an important business partner and a ""great ally"" in the fight against Iranian power in the Middle East. 
Following a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Ankara is not entirely satisfied with the level of cooperation it is receiving from Saudi Arabia regarding the case.

Cavusoglu said Ankara may seek a formal United Nations inquiry if its liaising with Riyadh comes to an impasse.

On the Irish 'backstop', an insurance policy to avoid a return to controls between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU state Ireland, she said this presented a situation that was ""very, very difficult to solve.""

""I think rightly, we have placed value on Britain not being able to decide unilaterally when it ends the customs union, but rather that Britain together with the EU defines this date and afterwards the future relationship comes into effect,"" she said.

The reports did not specify what crime the suspects were being held for, but the case has provoked outrage on social media over the cruelty inflicted on the animals as images of their ghastly ordeal emerged. 
From 7:00 pm till dawn, workers at the slaughterhouse would slowly pump water into cattle through tubes inserted into their nostrils before they were slaughtered for the market in nearby Nanjing, a provincial state-controlled TV broadcaster reported. 
Stills from a video clip shot by an undercover reporter from the broadcaster showed a swollen cattle on its knees with tears in its eyes. 
Workers whom the reporter spoke with said the process was cruel, though the foreman of the abattoir said the process was ""painless"". 
A number of social media users said the abattoir foreman should be pumped full of water instead.
""Cattle deserve to be treated with dignity too. Think about it, we should be grateful for their selflessness, which has helped fill our bellies,"" one social media user wrote. 
Beef from the slaughterhouse had been popular due to its prices, which averaged 30 yuan ($4.32) a kg, about 10 percent cheaper than its competitors, according to the broadcaster. 
Consumption of beef in China is growing faster than for other meats. But with limited land to produce big herds to meet rising beef demand, China has been stepping up imports. Last year, China shipped in almost 700,000 tonnes of the red meat worth about $3.3 billion.

In October the European Court of Justice said in an injunction that Poland had to suspend an overhaul of the Supreme Court, which effectively allowed the PiS to hand-pick top judges.
A justification of the draft amendment to the Supreme Court was published on the Polish parliament's website on Wednesday. ""The amendment constitutes an execution of the European Court of Justice injunction,"" it said.
Part of a sweeping overhaul of the judiciary, the reforms passed in July forced some top court judges into early retirement. The PiS said the changes were needed to make the courts more efficient, ignoring a series of EU warnings to backtrack.
The law lowered the retirement age of judges to 65 from 70. Since its implementation, over 20 Supreme Court judges — around one-third of the total — have been forced to quit.
The proposed amendment stipulates judges who were retired can continue to work at the court, although their retirement remains valid.
After the European Court of Justice ruling, the head of the PiS and Poland's de facto leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski said Warsaw would observe the EU law but would appeal against the EU court's decision. The ruling, however, carries no right to appeal.

The amendment proposal comes at a time of public concern over a case of an alleged corruption attempt involving the former head of financial market regulator.

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan authorities were struggling on Wednesday to identify the group behind a suicide bomb attack that killed at least 55 people attending a gathering of religious scholars in Kabul after the Taliban denied any responsibility.
The victims included religious delegates from various parts of the country, invited by the Afghan Ulema Council to celebrate the birth anniversary of Prophet Mohammad on Tuesday.
Without knowing who was behind the attack, it was unclear whether the aim was simply to undermine President Ashraf Ghani's government, or whether it was part of a strategy to keep the pressure on his government and its Western allies while they pursued talks with the Taliban, to end the 17-year long war.
""As of now we don't know which militant outfit could be behind the attack. Investigations are at a preliminary stage,"" said a senior security official who was at the blast site on Wednesday morning to collect forensic evidence.
The council, the country’s largest religious organization, brought together scholars from the Sunni sect, but it was uncertain whether the attack could have had a sectarian dimension.
Though Sunni themselves, Taliban and Islamic State fighters have targeted religious scholars aligned with the Afghan government in the past. 
This time, the Taliban quickly denied its involvement and condemned the attack on religious preachers and scholars.
Last week, Taliban leaders met U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad at their political headquarters in Qatar in an effort to pave the way for peace talks. The three-day meeting was the second in the past month.
Khalilzad has declared a deadline of April 20, when Afghanistan's presidential election falls due, to end the war, but the country's security situation has worsened since NATO formally ended combat operations in 2014.
During recent days, U.S. President Donald Trump has angered neighboring Pakistan, which Afghan intelligence and Western military leaders have long suspected of giving succor to the Taliban.
Over the weekend, Trump said in an interview Pakistan doesn't ""do a damn thing"" for the United States despite billions of dollars in U.S. aid, and alleged Pakistani officials knew of former al Qaeda leader bin Laden's location before his killing by U.S. troops in a raid inside Pakistan in 2011. 
The toll from Tuesday's attack could easily rise as most of the 80 wounded suffered severe injuries, hospital and government officials said early Wednesday, giving the latest casualty figures.
Investigators said the bomber had sneaked into a banquet hall on the first floor of a large building close to the Kabul airport, where some 200 people were gathered.
The explosion left body parts strewn all over the carpeted floor and copies of the Quran, the Muslim holy book, were scattered around burnt furniture.
""I was reciting verses from the Quran near the gate of the crowded banquet room when a loud explosion occurred. It was like a volcano,"" said Syed Usman, a Muslim scholar who had traveled from the outskirts of Kabul to attend.
Doctors at government and private hospitals in Kabul struggled to assist the badly wounded victims, many burned beyond recognition.

""The situation is really horrendous,"" said Mohammad Qaseem, a surgeon at the Kabul hospital.

PRETORIA (Reuters) - When U.S. President Donald Trump pledged to investigate large scale killings of white farmers in South Africa and violent takeovers of land, Pretoria said he was misinformed. Elsewhere, there was quiet satisfaction.
For a little-known South African activist group, Trump's intervention, following a Fox News show criticizing the land reform plans of President Cyril Ramaphosa's ruling African National Congress, signaled a job well done.
""The best possible outcome that we hoped for was for a statement by the president of the USA, which we got,"" Ernst Roets, deputy CEO of Afriforum, told Reuters in his office in a quiet suburb of the capital.
The office walls display photographs of street protests by Afriforum, stepped up this year against land distribution plans and what it calls the targeted killing of white farmers.
In South Africa, no land has been seized and while violent crime is a huge problem, the vast majority of victims are poor and black. Of 20,000 murders in the last recorded year, 46 were white people killed on farms, according to police data.
Afriforum is an interest group representing Afrikaners - the 5 percent of the population descended mainly from Dutch, German and French settlers.
It belongs to a wider movement called Solidarity, which has grown from a 100-year-old trade union into a sprawling and well-resourced organization offering education and training and a range of other services in Afrikaans.
Ramaphosa's vague pledge this year to pursue land expropriation without compensation to right the wrongs of apartheid has given new impetus to both groups, who have brushed aside his insistence he will protect property rights.
Critics, including some prominent Afrikaners, accuse them of stirring racial fears at a time when Ramaphosa is trying to defuse threats of unrest from a far-left party.
Solidarity says it reflects fears rather than stirring them.
""On expropriation, they can't threaten that sort of thing and not expect a reaction,"" Flip Buys, chairman of the umbrella movement, said by telephone.
""Some battles you must fight. We must save the country from what happened in Zimbabwe,"" he said, referring to the widespread violent takeover of white-owned farms in the early 2000s.
More fringe white groups, including the survivalist Suidlanders, have been warning for decades that Afrikaners are under threat.
But Solidarity and Afriforum are working at a different level, holding prominent protests, lobbying foreign governments and preparing to approach the United Nations to request land expropriation be recognized as a breach of human rights.
Afriforum and COPE, a party formed by dissident ANC members with three seats in parliament, said they met senior U.S. embassy officials on Monday to ask Washington to put pressure on South Africa to protect property rights.
The U.S. embassy said COPE and AfriForum delivered a petition to one of its officials.
HIJACKED
Conversations with a dozen members of Afriforum at its rallies and elsewhere, reviews of its social media accounts and private text messages sent by its members reveal an increasingly influential movement with an agenda that divides South Africa.
Roets had appeared on Tucker Carlson's Fox News show in May where they spoke about what they called targeted killings of white farmers and plans to take land along racial lines.
The government, academics and a wide range of commentators say neither is happening, but right-wing journalists from Canada, Britain and Australia have made programs on the issue.
""Afriforum has understood this emergence of white chauvinist identities around the world and is manipulating it for its own ends,"" said Adam Habib, vice-chancellor at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.
""The problem with that is it will fracture our communities.""
Max du Preez, an Afrikaans-speaking author and commentator, said Afriforum did not represent the community and did it a disservice by making it seem racist. ""If black people want to insult an Afrikaner they call him Afriforum,"" he said.
Roets denies Afriforum preys on white people's fears and said it was employing the same tactics as the ANC used in the 1980s to build pressure on the apartheid government.
""We learnt from the best. We have found the South African government is very sensitive to international criticism.""
Trump's intervention stole the limelight during Ramaphosa's high-profile visit to the U.N. general assembly in September.
Ramaphosa made light of Trump's comments but an ANC source said he was very angry.
Every president since Nelson Mandela led South Africa out of white-minority rule in 1994 has tried, and largely failed, to redress an imbalance whereby whites - nine percent of 56 million South Africans - own more than 70 percent of agricultural land.
Ramaphosa is competing in next year's election with a far-left party exploiting anger at persistent rural destitution among blacks alongside wealthy, white-owned commercial farms.
That party, the Economic Freedom Fighters, has threatened to nationalize all land and urged people to occupy it - calls which have so-far gone unheeded beyond a few groups erecting shacks on unused plots.
Ramaphosa, who replaced scandal-plagued Jacob Zuma in February, has said reforms will not harm the economy, investment or food security and that unused land in towns and cities would be a high priority. He has given few details, but has the support of most big businesses and foreign investor community.
Trump's tweet unnerved investors and drove down the rand and share prices, although they subsequently recovered. ""I have asked Secretary of State @SecPompeo to closely study the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers,"" it said.
A U.S. embassy spokesman said it was continuing to evaluate various issues, including land, as normal.
STATE WITHIN A STATE
Solidarity contains around 20 organizations, including a media company, a university and an investment fund. Its half a million members pay fees and a property portfolio and stock market investments are among other funding sources.
Reuters spoke to Afriforum members who believed the Afrikaner community was under threat and felt Solidarity was the only support network they could rely on.
Some described Solidarity as a ""state within a state"". 
Roets said Afriforum's membership was growing but it had no intention of trying to carve out a de-facto white state.
""There are certain buzzwords that we like to use and we encourage among our membership and those are words like 'self-reliance' like 'self-help' like 'independence',"" he said.
""If you want to describe that as a 'state within a state' that's fine.""
The Suidlanders, meanwhile, are preparing for battle.
In an isolated outpost town on the Orange River, they say they expect an ""imminent"" racial civil war.
Hoarding guns, clothes and food in bunkers hidden in the dry barren landscape, its growing membership has drawn up a detailed plan to carve off a section of the country.
""Some people think we are racists. It's totally not the case. We are purely and simply a civil defense organization,"" Suidlanders spokesman Simon Roche told Reuters.
Roche, who showed Reuters caravans filled with supplies ready for when ""war"" breaks out, says he has traveled to Washington and Europe to meet with likeminded groups and with politicians, although he declined to name them.

""We must tell the world what is coming. People can call us conspiracy theorists. Soon we will see who was right.""

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Gunmen kidnapped an Italian volunteer in southeast Kenya and shot five people late on Tuesday, police said, in the first abduction of a foreigner since a series of raids blamed on Somali Islamist militants six years ago.
Men armed with AK-47 rifles attacked the town of Chakama and seized the 23-year-old woman who was working for the small Italian charity Africa Milele Onlus, the National Police Service added.
The attackers spoke Somali and opened fire on people fleeing the scene, witness Chad Joshua Kazungu told Reuters by phone. ""There were three attackers and they targeted the Italian lady,"" he said. 
Five people were wounded, including a 10-year-old shot in the eye and a 12-year-old hit in the thigh, police said. They were all taken to hospital.
Chakama in Kenya's Kilifi region is 60 km (40 miles) inland from the bustling coastal tourist resort on Malindi.
Police said they had still not identified the attackers and their motives were unclear.
Another unnamed witness told Kenyan TV channel KTN News that the attackers grabbed the woman as she came out of her room to find out what was going on.
""Their aim was to get money but they took off with her to the river and, before leaving the village, they started shooting in the air and they shot one woman and four boys,"" the witness said.
Tourist numbers and earnings plunged sharply from 2012 to 2016 as militants from the Al Shabaab group in neighboring Somalia launched a series of attacks on Kenyan soil in retaliation for Kenya's military intervention in Somalia. 
A number of foreigners were kidnapped on the coast in 2011 and 2012 but not none has been abducted since.
The Italian embassy in Nairobi declined to comment on Tuesday's abduction and referred callers to the foreign ministry in Rome.
There was no immediate comment from the charity which, according to its website, was founded in 2011 by an Italian couple after they honeymooned in Africa.
Chakama is nearly 300 km (185 miles) southwest of the Kenya-Somalia border.

TOKYO/SEOUL (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Wednesday warned South Korea it risked damaging ties by disbanding a fund meant to settle compensation for South Korean women forced to work in Japanese military brothels during World War Two. 
""If international pledges are broken then forging ties between countries becomes impossible and as a member of the international community we urge South Korea to act responsibly,"" Abe told reporters at his residence in Tokyo. 
Under a 2015 deal, Japan apologized to the ""comfort women"" -- Japan's euphemism for Asian women, many of them Korean, forced to work in its wartime brothels. Tokyo provided a 1 billion yen (now $9.4 million) fund to help them.
On Wednesday, South Korea's Ministry of Gender Equality and Family said it planned to dissolve the Reconciliation and Healing Foundation after consulting with victims, their advocates and related agencies.
""We will make utmost efforts to carry out policy that can help the victims recover their honor and dignity,"" Minister Jin Sun-mee said in a statement. 
The two countries share a bitter history that includes Japan's 1910-45 colonization of the Korean peninsula, and the issue of comfort women has been a major obstacle to better relations. 
South Korean historians estimate there may have been up to 200,000 Korean women forced into sex slavery. There are 27 survivors registered with the government. 
Abe told South Korea's President Moon Jae-in in February the 2015 pact settled the dispute, but Moon said Japan was in no position to declare that as the ""perpetrator of wartime crimes against humanity.""
The South Korean ministry said it will discuss with Tokyo on what to do with the balance of the fund, which at the end of October stood at 16.08 billion won ($14.21 million), including Seoul's contributions. 
Kim Bok-dong, a surviving former comfort woman, welcomed the decision to disband the fund. 
""The only thing left is the Japanese government's repentance and compensation,"" she said in a statement released by a civic group supporting the victims, known as Jungdaehyup.
The group, and the ""House of Sharing,"" another major advocacy organization that provides a shelter for the victims, respectively issued a statement, calling for Seoul to nullify the deal and return the 1 billion yen to Japan. 
The fate of the money will deepen the dilemma for the Moon administration, which has refrained from formally breaking the agreement and vowed not to seek a renegotiation. 
The new row comes after South Korea's top court last month ruled that Japan's Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp (T:5401) must compensate four South Koreans for their forced wartime labor.
Japan denounced that judgment as ""unthinkable,"" saying that South Korea had waived all such claims in a 1965 pact under which Japan agreed to provide grants and loans to help spur South Korea's economic development. 
South Korea says nearly 5,000 victims of wartime forced labor are still alive, from a total of nearly 150,000 who were forced help the Japanese war effort by working in factories and mines in Japan.
A South Korean appeals court is expected to deliver its ruling in another case against Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (T:7011) in December.

PORT MORESBY (Reuters) - Barely a five-minute drive from the $50 million conference venue for the just-concluded Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Papua New Guinea's capital, a makeshift squatter settlement is tucked away from visiting world leaders. 
The Wanigela settlement in Port Moresby looks out directly over APEC Haus, but might as well be a world away. 
With the South Pacific nation's rainy season looming, Wanigela's thousands of residents are packed together in overcrowded and dilapidated dwellings with no sanitation and unreliable electricity supplies.
For all the hope and promise the APEC summit would put PNG on the world stage – and attract investment that will translate into jobs and infrastructure – many are questioning how such an international event will benefit their everyday lives.
""The government says APEC is going to improve our lives, but I don’t know, because our politics is not trustworthy,"" said Bradley Kalau, 31, who has been unemployed for two years. ""We find it very difficult because of a lack of education. It’s hard to find jobs and put bread and butter on the table.""
Close to half of Moresby's population of around 310,000 live in informal or squatter settlements, according to a 2015 study by the Pacific Region Infrastructure Facility. 
GRAPHIC: https://graphics.reuters.com/APEC-SUMMIT-PAPUA%20/010081DD2J3/PAPUA-PROTESTS.jpg 
The impoverished communities suffer from chronic unemployment and are prone to crime and gang violence, laying bare the socio-economic problems that will persist long after the APEC leaders depart. 
Kalau lives in a small wooden stilt-house perched on the rocky shores of Ela Beach, around a kilometer from an upmarket resort that hosted numerous APEC delegations. 
He lives under one roof with his wife and 30 other relatives spanning four generations, including siblings, cousins, nieces and nephews.
""The style we are living right now, it can change,"" Kalau’s younger cousin Junior Kalau said. ""Everything. Us getting jobs. We need our own house."" 
RICH IN RESOURCES
PNG, roughly the size of California, has more than 7.3 million people scattered over its mountainous interior and hundreds of small islands. 
While rich in minerals, timber, fish and energy resources, most rural people live subsistence lives and annual per capita GDP is around $3,600 a year, according to the IMF.
Moresby's shanty settlements, some decades-old, are mostly home to migrants from other parts of PNG who move to the capital to escape rural poverty and seek better access to social infrastructure including education and healthcare.
But a severe shortage of jobs and affordable housing has seen settlement populations swell out of control, with multiple families often sharing one roof, mostly pooling incomes from odd jobs and selling produce at street markets.
Many in gainful employment are also forced to live in ramshackle settlement dwellings. 
Despite holding down a respectable civil servant’s job with the national postal service, Banian Masiboda said “reasonable housing” remained out of reach.
Masiboda said too many people attracted by the ""bright lights"" of Port Moresby arrived unprepared. 
He said many questioned the wisdom of spending big on APEC when then were more immediate priorities to address at home. 
At the meeting, the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Japan did announce a $1.7 billion plan to ensure most of PNG had access to electricity by 2030.
Still, the view among many in the settlements was that APEC catered to the political ambitions of the elite while neglecting the masses. That was only reinforced when security personnel forced their way into parliament to demand unpaid wages, just two days after the summit ended.
""We did not look after own backyard first, but then we boldly stood up and said 'Yes, we can host APEC',"" Masiboda said.
The forum's chairman, PNG Prime Minister Peter O'Neill, said in his closing remarks at APEC that the region had to focus on reducing trade barriers to ensure prosperity for all people.
""APEC leaders continue to focus on efforts trying to reduce inequalities,"" he told reporters in Port Moresby on Sunday.
In the nearby squatter settlements, communities feel the gap between rich and poor is as great as it's ever been. 
""If we feed our own mouths, there won't be any crime,"" Bradley Kalau said.

""We feel left out. We are rich in our natural resources, but we are beggars in our own country.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - A Chinese environmental journalist's account of police harassment while reporting on a chemical spill has sparked widespread condemnation online and an apology from the police. 
Chinese financial publication Caixin on Sunday published an article by reporter Zhou Chen describing how local authorities had trailed her for days as she reported on a leak of a petrochemical substance in the coastal city of Quanzhou in the southeastern province of Fujian.
Late on Nov. 11, the last evening of her trip, four policemen entered her room without permission and searched her belongings while she was in her pyjamas, Zhou wrote.
""After the police left, I was frightened into a state of indecision for a long while. How could they just barge right into the hotel room of a law-abiding citizen who had registered at check-in,"" she wrote.
On social media she likened the experience to being the subject of a police raid carried out to catch prostitutes and their clients.
The article set of a wave of criticism of the police on social media, leading to a rare apology from the local authorities and for one officer to be suspended and investigated, state media said. 
While foreign correspondents in China often write about their experiences of harassment by police, it is unusual for Chinese journalists to publicly complain.
Many local authorities and officials continue to see public oversight as ""nitpicking"" and in response ""play little tricks"" to avoid journalists, the official Chinese Communist Party's People's Daily Overseas Edition wrote.
Other journalists also came forward with their own stories of police following them and interfering in their reporting.
One female journalist wrote of an incident in 2014 when a male police officer had forced her to provide a urine sample in a hotel bathroom with glass walls.
""Reporters being 'accompanied' seems to be becoming a new normal within journalism,"" wrote another Caixin journalist, Liang Yingfei.
Once, while reporting in northern China, she was called back to her hotel by reception staff who said there was a leak in her room, but once she arrived she discovered it was a ruse by officials who were waiting in the hotel lobby, Liang wrote.
In another case, one of Liang's interviewees called her and said he had been repeatedly investigated after speaking to her for a story.
""All I could do was repeatedly comfort him by saying that reporting is not a crime and neither is accepting interviews,"" Liang wrote.
Some social media commentators said the case reflected a tendency of officials to abuse their authority.
""We continuously stress the need for 'law-based governance', but ... officials can abuse public power whenever they want in order to protect their position,"" one user wrote.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia will not sign up to a United Nations migration agreement because it would compromise its hardline immigration policy and endanger national security, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Wednesday.
Australia joins the United States, Israel and several Eastern European countries in rejecting the U.N. Global Compact for Migration, which asks signatories not to detain would-be migrants arbitrarily and to use detention only as a last resort.
Morrison said that would jeopardize national security.
""The global compact on migration would compromise Australia's interest,"" Morrison told 2GB Radio. ""It doesn't distinguish between those who illegally enter Australia and those who come the right way.""
Under Canberra's tough immigration policy, which has bipartisan support, asylum seekers arriving by boat are told they will never be allowed to settle in Australia.
They are then detained in two detention centers on remote South Pacific islands until they are accepted by another nation or agree to return home. The camps have been widely criticized by the United Nations and human rights groups.
""Australia is a textbook case of how not to treat boat arrivals, by sending them offshore to endure abysmal conditions for years and trying to shirk its international responsibilities onto less-developed countries,"" said Elaine  Pearson  (LON:PSON), Human Rights Watch's Australia director.
Australia's rejection of the U.N. pact is the latest move to tighten migration through a series of policies that are likely to form a central element of Morrison's bid for re-election at a national ballot that must be held by May 2019.
Opinion polls indicate his conservative government is on course for a landslide defeat.
Australia has an annual immigration cap of 190,000 places. Morrison said this week his government would likely reduce that threshold, a policy that is popular with voters.
A Fairfax-Ipsos poll published on Monday found 45 percent of voters wanted immigration reduced, while a little more than 20 percent wanted an increase.
Morrison's government said in October it would restrict new immigrants from living in Australia's largest cities - Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane - for up to five years.
Although likely to win favor with voters, critics argued such a policy could lead to labor shortages. 

Australia's central bank governor said in August an influx of new residents had helped to underpin strong economic growth.

In an operation called ""Sword at the Country's Gate 2018"", the customs authority has made the crackdown on smuggled foreign waste one of its priorities this year. 
China told the World Trade Organisation last year that it would ban 24 types of recyclable materials, including plastics, and gradually phase out shipments of other waste. 
It said this week that it would ban a further 32 products such as hardware, ships, auto parts and stainless steel scrap starting from Dec. 31.
China was previously the recipient of most of the world's waste, with shipments reaching as high as 47 million tonnes in 2015, and the ban has forced Europe and the United States to seek alternative destinations in southeast Asia. 
China's trash imports had supported hundreds of small-scale scrap and plastic recycling plants along the coast since the 1980s. 
But the government regards low-grade recycling to be inconsistent with the country's aims to clean up its own waste, ""upgrade"" its economy and move up the global supply chain.

851,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 10:35PM ET</span>","More civilian focus, less military, in South China Sea would ease fears: Chinese paper","BEIJING (Reuters) - China should put more focus on building civilian facilities on islands in the South China Sea and less emphasis on the military to better sooth regional fears about China's intentions, an influential state-run paper said on Wednesday.
The disputed, strategic waterway is claimed almost in its entirety by China, whose continued building of military installations on artificial islands and reefs there has unnerved the region and angered Washington.
In a commentary, China's Study Times said there was a ""potential risk of war"" for areas surrounding the country such as the South China Sea.
""Unprecedented outside military interference is the biggest threat to peace and stability in the South China Sea,"" said the paper, published by the Central Party School which trains rising officials.
""Without the strong deterrence power of our military in the South China Sea, the protecting regional peace and stability is merely idle theorizing and falls short of what we would wish.""
But there must be a greater role for non-military actors in the South China Sea, it added.
""Facilities on the reefs and islands of the South China Sea should be more civilian and less military,"" the paper wrote.
That means there should be more focus on building lighthouses, civilian airports, maritime search and rescue, scientific research and weather forecasting, it added.
""Just as the Chinese government has repeatedly stressed, after the completion of the island facilities, they will actively provide relevant public security products and services to regional countries,"" the paper said.
This will help the international community with things like counter-terror and anti-piracy operations, to jointly safeguard peace and security in the South China Sea, it added.
China has previously said some civilian facilities on the islands are intended for use by others in the region, but the government has given few details about how that may work in practice.
The islands China occupies in the South China Sea are off-limits to foreigners, with access under the effective control of the People's Liberation Army despite them technically being administratively part of China's southern Hainan province.
Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Brunei also have competing claims in the South China Sea.
China has frequently lambasted the United States and its allies for freedom of navigation naval operations near to Chinese-occupied islands. 
The United States earlier this month again urged China to halt militarization of the South China Sea. 

China said it had the right to build ""necessary defense facilities"" on what it considers its own territory and urged Washington to stop sending warships and military planes close to the islands that Beijing claims.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A witness at the U.S. drug trafficking trial of accused Sinaloa Cartel leader Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman on Tuesday testified that he paid a multimillion-dollar bribe to an underling of Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in 2005.
The witness, Jesus Zambada, also said he paid millions of dollars in bribes to former Mexican government official Genaro Garcia Luna on behalf of his brother, drug lord Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada, who remains at large.
A spokesman for Lopez Obrador did not immediately respond to a call and text message seeking comment. 
Garcia Luna, in a written statement, said the accusations were ""defamation"" and ""perjury"" and made without any proof. 
Garcia Luna said he had received commendations from high-level U.S. officials for his labors in fighting organized crime in Mexico and that he had been ""systematically defamed"" due to the actions he took against criminal networks.
""There has never been a single proof or evidence of all those infamies,"" he said.
Zambada gave his testimony about the bribes on the fifth day of trial under cross-examination by one of Guzman's lawyers, William Purpura. Guzman's lawyers have said they will try to prove that Guzman is being scapegoated and that Ismael Zambada was the real head of the Sinaloa Cartel. 
Guzman, 61, is charged with 17 criminal counts and faces life in prison if he is convicted. He was extradited to the United States in January 2017, after twice escaping Mexican prisons. 
Zambada, who was called to testify against Guzman under an agreement with U.S. prosecutors, previously told jurors that his brother and Guzman worked together for years to move multi-ton shipments of cocaine from Colombia through Mexico into the United States, while arranging for their rivals to be murdered.
During Purpura's cross-examination, Zambada said he paid ""a few million"" dollars to a Mexico City government official while Lopez Obrador was head of government there. He said the bribe was paid because it was believed at the time that the official could become Mexico's next secretary of public security.
The name of the official was not immediately clear from the court testimony. But Gabriel Regino, a former subsecretary of public security in Mexico City who is now a criminal law professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, wrote on Twitter that an accusation of bribery had emerged against him in the trial but was false.
Zambada also said under cross-examination that he handed a suitcase containing $3 million to Garcia Luna in 2005 or 2006, when Garcia Luna was director of Mexico's Federal Investigation Agency. 
Garcia Luna said the charge was ""unbelievable"" since he was not able to appoint officials to posts, as Zambada alleged, and such designations were made by a council. 
Zamabda said he gave him another $3 million to $5 million in 2007, when he had become secretary of public security, to secure favorable treatment for the cartel.

Garcia Luna said he never had contact with Zambada and there was a public record of all his meetings in and out of the office when he was secretary of public security.

853,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 08:12PM ET</span>","Traffic jams, bitter cold on this year's Thanksgiving menu","By Barbara Goldberg
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Americans may need an extra helping of patience this Thanksgiving weekend, with the largest number of travelers in a decade expected to hit the road or board flights to celebrate with family and friends after a prosperous year for many.
The weather could complicate the journey in many parts of the country, as bitter, record-breaking cold blankets much of the Northeast on Thursday, Thanksgiving Day, and heavy rain in Northern California threatens to bring mudslides.
Beginning on Tuesday, more than 54 million Americans are expected to travel 50 miles or more for the traditional feast, jamming highways, airports, railroads and waterways, according to the American Automobile Association, the largest U.S. automotive advocacy group. That would rank as the highest travel volume since 2005.
""Consumers have a lot to be thankful for this holiday season: higher wages, more disposable income and rising levels of household wealth,"" Bill Sutherland, a senior vice president at AAA Travel, said in a statement. ""This is translating into more travelers kicking off the holiday season with a Thanksgiving getaway.""
Those traveling by air should expect long security lines, while those driving to their Thanksgiving destinations should plan for aggravating traffic tangles, AAA said. 
Drivers in San Francisco, New York City and Boston are likely to experience the worst delays, with their journeys expected to take nearly four times as long as normal, said transportation analytics company INRIX. 
Weather could disrupt travel in California, where there will be a substantial risk of heavy rain on Thursday, said David Roth, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. Following the worst wildfire in state history, downpours may trigger mudslides on the scorched slopes north of Sacramento and elsewhere that have been denuded of trees.
Many other parts of the nation, meanwhile, will have a bitterly cold but clear holiday, weather forecasters said. 
Boston may endure the coldest Thanksgiving on record, Roth said. A forecast high of 21 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 6.1 Celsius) would break the record of 24 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 4.4 Celsius) set on Thanksgiving Day in 1901.
On Wednesday, light snow will fall in New York, though it is not expected to stick, while a couple of inches will likely accumulate in Boston, Roth said. 
Wind gusts of up to 40 miles (64 km) per hour could affect Thanksgiving parades in the Northeast, including the world-famous Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade in New York City, but not travel itself, Roth said. 
If sustained winds exceed 23 miles per hour, city guidelines may force Macy's organizers to lower the height at which the parade's 16 giant balloons can fly, the New York City Police Department told reporters.
""In the morning, just prior to the start of the event, the NYPD and Macy’s will make a final determination on the flight of the giant balloons,"" Macy's spokesman Orlando Veras said in an email.
Airlines, including Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines Inc and American Airlines Inc (O:AAL) reported robust or even record-breaking ticket sales for the holiday travel period.
United expects to fly about 2.2 million travelers between Wednesday and Sunday, the most in its history for the period, spokesman Charles Hobart said.

The bad news for Thanksgiving guests who finish their second helping of pumpkin pie, thinking that the worst of their travel woes is behind them? The busiest travel day of the year, on the ground and in the air, is expected on Sunday, the end of the holiday weekend.

Speaking as a working group with South Korea to coordinate North Korean policy held an inaugural meeting in Washington, Pompeo indicated that Washington had been concerned that Seoul had moved too quickly with Pyongyang. 
""We have made clear to the Republic of Korea that we do want to make sure that peace on the peninsula and the denuclearization of North Korea aren’t lagging behind the increase in the amount of inter-relationship between the two Koreas,"" he told a news briefing. 
""We view them as tandem, as moving forward together,"" Pompeo added. ""We view them as important parallel processes, and that working group is designed to make sure they continue to remain that way.""
The working group is headed by South Korea's special representative for Korean Peninsula peace and security affairs, Lee Do-hoon, and Stephen Biegun, the U.S. special representative for North Korea.
Pompeo said he believed there was ""complete agreement"" on how to proceed. 
South Korea's Yonhap news agency quoted a statement from Seoul's Foreign Ministry as saying the two sides in the meeting agreed to continue close coordination and cooperation on an ""increasingly systemic and regular basis.""
Last month, in a rare sign of discord between Seoul and Washington, South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said Pompeo had expressed ""discontent"" at an inter-Korean military pact reached during a summit in September.
The Koreas also agreed in October to begin reconnecting rail and road links despite U.S. concerns that the rapid North-South thaw could undermine efforts to press Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons.
At an unprecedented summit in June, U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed to work toward denuclearization and peace on the Korean peninsula and establish new relations. 
But negotiations have since made little headway, with Pyongyang upset by Washington's insistence that international sanctions must remain until it gives up its nuclear weapons.
Last week, South Korean Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon said in Washington it was important to provide North Korea with motivation to denuclearize but that sanctions would stay in place ""until we see actual progress on denuclearization.""

""We strongly encourage both sides to reach a deal and are prepared to (introduce) legislation if we do not see a resolution over the next few days,"" federal Labour Minister Patty Hajdu said in a statement.
Previous governments have used back-to-work legislation to end strikes in critical sectors. The ruling Liberals have a majority in the House of Commons, which means lawmakers could quickly approve such a measure.
Canada Post says massive backlogs of mail have already built up at its main sorting centers. Mail is being delivered to customers sporadically.

Colombia made a verbal request on Nov. 6 for Cuba's government to provide information about the presence of several commanders of the National Liberation Army (ELN) in Cuban territory, the foreign ministry said in a statement.
It also asked Havana to act on an Interpol Red Notice on Rodriguez, the rebel group's leader. An Interpol Red Notice is a ""request to locate and provisionally arrest an individual pending extradition."" 
Rodriguez, also known by his nom de guerre Gabino, has been in Cuba for several months receiving medical treatment.
The Cuban government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The move by Colombia may hobble efforts to reactivate peace talks between the government and the ELN. Colombian President Ivan Duque in August said he was halting the Cuba-based negotiations until the rebels freed all its hostages.
The guerrillas hold about 10 hostages. 
In September, Duque relieved the government negotiating team - in a scheduled administrative move - and said he would not send a new team back to Cuba until the captives were freed and the ELN ceased criminal activity.
The rebels have said the liberation of hostages was not a pre-condition for talks agreed at the start of negotiations in February 2017.
The ELN, considered a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union, has been at war with the Colombian government since 1964. The larger FARC, formerly a guerrilla group and now a political party, agreed a peace deal with the government in 2016.

Interpol cannot compel a country to arrest an individual.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina vowed on Tuesday to crack down on any anarchists and anti-capitalist protesters who try to disrupt next week's Group of 20 gathering in Buenos Aires, saying it was working with foreign governments to identify and block entry to potential trouble-makers.
Argentina's government, which faces near daily, occasionally violent protests over its economic austerity program, does not want a repeat of the havoc that overshadowed last year's summit of leaders from key industrialized and developing nations in Hamburg, Germany. Protesters set cars on fire and blocked streets and bridges leading to the summit venue.
This year's G20 summit will be held in the Argentine capital from Nov. 30 to Dec. 1. Local leftist groups are planning marches against the gathering and have invited activists from around the world to join them. Neither the groups nor the government say they will tolerate violence.
""We will not permit illegal acts. Those who want to cross the line will have to face the legal consequences,"" Security Minister Patricia Bullrich told reporters.
The event will be guarded by 22,000 police and 700 security ministry agents, and the government has been in contact with a number of foreign security services, including those in the United States, Britain, Brazil, Italy and Spain, she said.
""People already facing criminal charges, or who have called for violence or illegal behavior, will not be allowed to enter the country,"" Bullrich said.
Sources familiar with U.S. government assessments said Washington was unaware of any serious threat of attacks or disruptions of the G20 meeting. They said Argentina's relative remoteness could deter some protesters from traveling there.
Asked if any members of violence-prone international groups had already tried to enter Argentina, Hernan Lombardi, technical coordinator of the gathering, said, ""There have been no signs of that so far.""
December is usually the month when protests over Argentina's chronically troubled economy turn violent. With inflation at a dizzying 45 percent and the economy contracting, popular unrest could be an additional security factor. 
Protesters have often taken out their fury about fast-rising prices at Christmas-time by burning stores and blocking roads. Last December police used tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon to push back rock-throwing protesters angry about the government's pension reform plan.
Police also clashed with protesters outside parliament in October as lawmakers debated a new budget containing steep spending cuts aimed at erasing the country's fiscal deficit.

Authorities will cordon off a 12-square-kilometer (5-square-mile) area around the riverside Costa Salguero convention center, where the summit will be held. Wide parts of Buenos Aires and its transportation system will be shut down. Traffic on the River Plate, Argentina's main cargo thoroughfare, will be suspended.

858,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 06:40PM ET</span>",Criticism mounts as Interpol set to elect Russian as president,"By Luke Baker
PARIS (Reuters) - International police body Interpol is expected to elect a senior Russian official as its next president on Wednesday, in a move that has provoked alarm in Europe and the United States about the risk of Kremlin meddling.
Interpol's 194 member states, meeting in Dubai for their annual congress, will hold the election on Wednesday morning, a spokesman for the Lyon-based agency said, with a candidate needing two-thirds of the ballots cast to be elected. Multiple voting rounds are possible. 
There are two official candidates, and write-ins are still possible, but the vote is widely expected to lead to Russia's Alexander Prokopchuk, a police major-general and currently one of Interpol's four vice-presidents, being chosen to succeed China's Meng Hongwei as president for a four-year term.
Meng disappeared in September during a trip to China. Days after his wife reported him missing, Chinese authorities said he was being investigated for taking bribes. He has not been seen since, but sent a letter to Interpol resigning.
The presidency of the body is largely ceremonial, with day-to-day work handled by Secretary-General Jurgen Stock of Germany, but it still commands influence. That has led to widespread concern in Europe and the United States about the possibility of Russia being able to exploit Interpol's power.
""Russia has consistently misused Interpol to pursue its political opponents,"" Guy Verhofstadt, a former prime minister of Belgium and a leading member of the European Parliament, wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. 
""(If) Prokopchuk takes charge, democratic and free countries may need to develop a parallel organisation (to Interpol). Worrying times for the international order.""
""RED NOTICES""
A bipartisan group of U.S. senators this week accused Russia of exploiting the global body to settle scores and harass dissidents by issuing warrants, known as red notices, for their arrest.
They said the election of Prokopchuk, a senior Russian interior ministry official, would allow Moscow to step up such abuse, which has in the past targeted Bill Browder, a prominent Kremlin critic based in Britain.
Browder, a fund manager who has driven efforts to impose sanctions on Russia via the Magnitsky Act, was briefly arrested in Spain in May on a red notice. He said it would be ""outrageous"" if Prokopchuk was elected president.
""This particular individual has been responsible for trying to chase me down and have Interpol arrest me seven times,"" he told BBC radio. ""All of a sudden, this guy is now put in charge of the institution he's been trying to abuse for the last six years.""
Russian dissident and former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky on Tuesday gave a news conference in London alongside Browder.
Appointing Prokopchuk ""would not only damage the reputation of all Interpol member states, but would carry a grave threat to those who may be considered potential victims of political persecution,"" said Khodorkovsky. 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the concerns raised by the U.S. senators, suggesting they were trying to influence the outcome of the Interpol vote.
""This is probably a certain kind of interference in the electoral process of an international organization,"" he said. 
Officials at Interpol declined to comment.
In an editorial this week, the London Times said Prokopchuk's likely election called into question the viability of Interpol, set up as the International Criminal Police Commission in 1923, before being renamed Interpol in 1956.

""If Interpol is to restore its credibility it has to introduce new safeguards,"" the paper wrote. ""Interpol has to act more swiftly to weed out fake demands from states like Russia and China which manifestly do not respect the rule of law.""

860,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 06:10PM ET</span>",Mexican president-elect's party presents national guard plan,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Lawmakers from Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) on Tuesday submitted a bill for a new national guard that aims to replace the armed forces in the fight against organized crime.
The bill aims to create a new 50,000-strong force drawn from the ranks of the armed forces and federal police, a step requiring changes to the constitution. Critics fear it could further militarize the fight against criminal gangs.
Former President Felipe Calderon sent in the armed forces to fight warring drug cartels at the end of 2006, but the gang violence has since claimed more than 170,000 lives.
""More than 90 percent of crimes end up going unpunished, and the country is still seriously suffering from not having a professional police force,"" said MORENA congresswoman Maria Alvarado as she set out the grounds for the initiative.
Trying to stem the bloodshed, successive Mexican governments have made changes to police and security forces. The deployment of the armed forces was only intended to be temporary.
The outgoing administration of President Enrique Pena Nieto created a gendarmerie to oversee the fight against organized crime. It was later heavily scaled back.
The crackdown against gangs has led to frequent accusations of human rights abuses by the armed forces.
Pena Nieto's administration has been condemned for its handling of a number of cases, in particular the 2014 abduction and disappearance of 43 student teachers by a drug gang in cahoots with local police in southwest Mexico.
Lopez Obrador, a leftist who takes office on Dec. 1, wants to curb the violence by tackling poverty and inequality, and has floated the idea of an amnesty for some lesser criminals.
To complement that push, his government also aims to liberalize laws for drugs including marijuana.
But the national guard plan has sparked criticism from some human rights groups and opposition politicians, who see it as a continuation of the existing policy under a different guise.
With the national guard, ""the strategy of militarization is deepened,"" said Lucia Riojas, an independent opposition congresswoman. ""And it's become clear in the last 12 years that there's absolutely no evidence that having the army on the streets helps to reduce the violence,"" she told Reuters.
The draft bill contemplates changes to the constitution that would mean that national guard members receive human rights training, are tried by civil courts and will not be able to move detainees to military institutions.

(Reuters) - Heavy rains were due to create new problems for residents of Northern California late on Tuesday, raising the risk of mudslides in an area where people left homeless by the state's deadliest wildfire remain huddled in parking lot encampments.
State and federal officials warned people to be alert to the risk of sudden flows of debris down the scorched, denuded slopes of the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains, where the Camp Fire has killed at least 79 people since breaking out on Nov. 8.
""There are people still living in tents,"" Eric Kurth, a meteorologist in the National Weather Service's Sacramento office, said in a telephone interview. ""That's certainly not going to be pleasant with the rain, and we might get some wind gusting up to 40 to 45 miles per hour (64 to 72 kph).""
The risk of debris slides could be lessened if the forecasted 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 centimeters) of rainfall was spread out over several days rather than in more intense bursts, he said. The rain also would extinguish some of the flames and dislodge some of the toxic smoke, Kurth said.
""We're really expecting the air quality to improve. That's the bright side for those people up there,"" he said.
The fire largely obliterated the town of Paradise, a community of nearly 27,000 people about 175 miles (280 km) north of San Francisco. The Butte County Sheriff's Office has tentatively identified 64 of the 79 victims.
Meanwhile, the missing-persons list compiled by the sheriff's office was revised downward to 699 names on Tuesday from nearly 900 on Monday.
The number of unaccounted people has fluctuated dramatically in the past week as more were reported missing or as some initially listed as unaccounted for either turn up alive or are confirmed dead.
As of early Tuesday, the fire had torched more than 151,000 acres (61,100 hectares) of parched scrub and trees and incinerated about 12,000 homes, Cal Fire said.
Containment lines have been built around 70 percent of its perimeter, according to Cal Fire.
Smoke from the fire has led to school closures in the region. Citing poor air quality, schools and colleges in the Sacramento area will remain closed until Nov. 26.
Many flights in and out of San Francisco have been delayed or canceled because of the smoke.
""WET CONCRETE""
The rain was expected to make it more difficult for teams search through ash and debris for human remains.
Intense fire over the slopes of canyons, hills and mountains makes them more prone to landslides, by burning away vegetation and organic material that normally holds soil in place. The fire also creates a hard, waxy surface that tends to repel rather than absorb water.
The result can be heavy runoff of rainwater mixed with mud, boulders, trees and other debris that flows downhill with tremendous force, said Jason Kean, a research hydrologist for the U.S. Geological Survey.
""Those debris flows have the consistency of wet concrete and move faster than you can run,"" he said. ""It's like a flood on steroids ... and a big one can take out two-story buildings.""
The number of residents needing temporary shelter was unclear but as many as 52,000 people were under evacuation orders at the height of the firestorm last week.
Nearly 500 miles south of Paradise near Malibu, west of Los Angeles, at least 2 inches (5 cm) of rain are expected to fall on a second fire, the Woolsey, which has killed three people. That blaze was 96 percent contained as of Monday evening.
The cause of both fires is under investigation but electric utilities reported localized equipment problems around the time they broke out.

PG&E Corp (N:PCG) has said it could face liability that exceeds its insurance coverage if its equipment were found to have caused the Camp Fire.

862,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 06:00PM ET</span>","Turkey, U.S. discussed return of jailed Halkbank executive: Turkey foreign minister","WASHINGTON/ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey and the United States have discussed returning a jailed executive from state-owned lender Halkbank to Turkey where he can serve the rest of his sentence from an Iran sanctions-busting case, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Tuesday.
In May, a U.S. court jailed Hakan Atilla, an executive from Halkbank, to 32 months in prison for helping Tehran get around U.S. sanctions, in a case that has strained already tense ties between the NATO allies.
Halkbank has since faced potential U.S. fines in relation to the case, while the U.S. Treasury is also considering a fine against the bank.
Speaking to reporters following talks with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington, Cavusoglu said Halkbank had not violated any U.S. sanctions, adding that he had discussed what steps could be taken in the case during his talks.
""There is also the situation of Hakan Atilla being sent to Turkey. As part of bilateral agreements, he can serve the rest of his sentence in Turkey. We also evaluated what could be done on this issue,"" Cavusoglu said.
Halkbank denies any wrongdoing and President Tayyip Erdogan has condemned the case as a political attack against his government, while his son-in-law, Finance Minister Berat Albayrak, said he did not expect the bank to face a fine.
Erdogan has said he has discussed Halkbank's case with U.S. President Donald Trump, saying the talks were on a ""positive path"". 
He said earlier this month that Trump had told him ""he would instruct the relevant ministers immediately"" regarding the Halkbank case, without elaborating.
However, Cavusoglu warned on Tuesday that if Washington did not end legal proceedings against Halkbank, they would be considered ""politically motivated"".
""Since there was no evidence - and the jury couldn't prove it either - these proceedings need to be stopped. Otherwise they will be politically motivated,"" he said.
Turkey has accused the United States of waging an economic war against it amid a currency crisis that saw the lira currency plunge more than 40 percent this year. 
Strained ties between Ankara and Washington began to improve after U.S. pastor Andrew Brunson, who was on trial over terror-related charges in Turkey, was released last month. 
The NATO allies remain divided on a host of other issues, including U.S. policy in Syria and Turkey's request for the United States to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a cleric Ankara blames for organizing the 2016 abortive putsch. Gulen denies involvement.
Cavusoglu said on Tuesday that the Halkbank case was a plot by Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999, against Turkey.

Speaking to reporters in Washington after meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Cavusoglu said Turkey has shared the latest information on the Khashoggi killing with the United States and repeated Ankara's stance that the truth had to come out on who gave the orders to kill the journalist.
""The cooperation with Saudi Arabia (over Khashoggi) is not at a level where we would want it to be,"" Cavusoglu told reporters, adding that if liaising with Riyadh came to a standstill, Ankara could seek a formal U.N. inquiry.
Khashoggi, a U.S.-based Washington Post columnist who was a critic of the Saudi government run by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed in October at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.
After offering numerous contradictory explanations for Khashoggi's disappearance, Riyadh said last week he had been killed and his body dismembered when ""negotiations"" to convince him to return to Saudi Arabia failed. The public prosecutor said it would seek the death penalty for five suspects in the case.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said the killing was ordered at the ""highest levels"" of the Saudi government but has not directly accused Prince Mohammed. Saudi Arabia has denied that the prince ordered Khashoggi's killing.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday vowed to remain a ""steadfast partner"" of Saudi Arabia, despite saying that the Saudi crown prince may have known about the plan to murder the dissident journalist last month.
Turkey has also handed to the United States a list of 84 individuals that it wants extradited, Cavusoglu said, over their links with Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, blamed by Ankara for orchestrating a 2016 coup attempt. Gulen denies involvement.

He added that Ankara had passed on the list following a telephone conversation between Erdogan and Trump.

864,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 03:59PM ET</span>","Detained activists in Saudi Arabia subjected to torture, sexual harassment: rights groups","GENEVA (Reuters) - Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch accused Saudi Arabia on Tuesday of subjecting several activists including some female human rights defenders detained since May to torture and sexual harassment.
Over a dozen women's rights activists have been arrested since May, most of whom had campaigned for the right to drive and an end to the kingdom's male guardianship system, though some have since been freed. 
A group of U.N. experts last month called for the immediate release of six female human rights defenders it said were still being held incommunicado in the kingdom.
The May arrests followed an earlier crackdown on clerics, intellectuals, and activists in September 2017 in an apparent bid to silence potential opponents of Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. 
The torture allegations come with Saudi Arabia facing an international outcry over the killing last month of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.
In a statement, London-based Amnesty said that according to testimony from three individuals it had gathered, some of the detained activists ""were repeatedly tortured by electrocution and flogging"" that left some ""unable to walk or stand properly"".
In a similar statement, Human Rights Watch quoted ""informed sources"" as saying Saudi interrogators tortured at least three female Saudi activists. Both Amnesty and Human Rights Watch said the detainees were subjected to sexual harassment.
""Only a few weeks after the ruthless killing of Jamal Khashoggi, these shocking reports of torture, sexual harassment and other forms of ill-treatment, if verified, expose further outrageous human rights violations by the Saudi authorities,” Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International's Middle East research director, said in the statement.
Reuters could not verify the allegations and the rights groups did not clarify the identity of the individuals who provided testimony. Human Rights Watch said the sources were concerned that they and the activists would suffer reprisals if identified publicly.
A Saudi government communications office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Riyadh has in the past denied using torture and said that arrests were made on the basis of suspicious contacts with foreign entities and offering financial support to ""enemies overseas"".
Last June the Saudi government ended a decades-old ban on women driving cars as part of a bid to diversify the economy away from oil and open up Saudis' cloistered lifestyles.
But while many hailed the end of the ban on women driving as proof of a new progressive trend, it has been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said the killing of Khashoggi was ordered at the ""highest levels"" of the Saudi government but has not directly accused Prince Mohammed. Saudi Arabia has denied that the prince ordered Khashoggi's killing.

""We strongly endorse Kim Jong Yang, who is serving as its acting president,"" Pompeo told reporters at the State Department.
""We encourage all nations and organizations that are part of Interpol and that respect the rule of law to choose a leader of credibility and integrity that reflects one of the world's most critical law enforcement bodies. We believe Mr. Kim will be just that,"" Pompeo said.
U.S. lawmakers have been lobbying President Donald Trump's administration to oppose Prokopchuk's candidacy, charging that Russia has been abusing Interpol, trying to use it to settle scores and harass dissidents by issuing warrants for their arrest.
Kim was named acting president of Interpol in October after then-President Meng Hongwei disappeared while on a trip to his home country of China. China later said he was being investigated for bribery and other violations.
The France-based Interpol later said Meng had resigned as president, and Beijing said he was being expelled from a high-profile but largely ceremonial advisory body to parliament.
The battle to succeed Meng turned political after Prokopchuk, a former major general in Russia's Ministry of the Interior, emerged as one of the favorites to get the job, a prospect that alarmed critics of President Vladimir Putin.
Russian dissident and former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky on Tuesday gave a news conference in London alongside U.S.-born Kremlin critic Bill Browder at which both warned against Prokopchuk's election, saying it would make it easier for the Kremlin to manipulate Interpol. Moscow has rejected such claims.

A draft of the report found he traveled for 529 out of the 668 days audited, spending $488,518 with no regard for the rules, Britain's The Guardian newspaper reported in September.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had accepted Solheim's resignation, which would be effective from Thursday, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters.

867,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 02:41PM ET</span>",Israel to turn to U.S. government over Airbnb removal of settlement listings,"By Jeffrey Heller
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel plans to consult with the U.S. government over a decision by home-renting company  to remove listings in Jewish settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, a cabinet minister said on Tuesday.
Palestinians who want to establish an independent state in territory including the West Bank that Israel captured in a 1967 war welcomed the San Francisco-based firm's move, announced on Monday and taking effect in the coming days. Israel called it a ""wretched capitulation"" to boycotters.
""We will approach the U.S. government because 25 U.S. states have sanctions against American companies that boycott Israel,"" Strategic Affairs Minister Gilad Erdan said on Israeli Army Radio.
""In this respect, there is no distinction between this part or that part of the State of Israel,"" he said, asserting that the West Bank, which Israel has never annexed, should also fall under the anti-boycott protection.
Palestine Legal, a Palestinian rights group that monitors U.S. anti-boycott legislation, said on its website that some of the laws enacted at U.S. state level apply both to Israel and ""territories controlled by Israel"", an allusion to areas such as the West Bank.
Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat called Airbnb's decision an ""initial positive step"".
Israeli settlements in occupied territory are considered illegal by most world powers. Palestinians deem the settlements to be obstacles to their goal of establishing an independent state. Israel disputes this. 
On its own website, Airbnb said ""many in the global community have stated that companies should not be doing business here (in the occupied territories) because they believe companies should not profit on lands where people have been displaced"".
Subsequently, it concluded it should remove the approximately 200 ""listings in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank that are at the core of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians"".
Those listings would not include settlements in East Jerusalem, territory Israel annexed in a move not recognized abroad and which the Palestinians want for a future capital, or the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war. 
Airbnb said it has developed a framework for evaluating how it should treat listings in occupied territories around the world. 
""Israel is a special place and our over 22,000 hosts are special people who have welcomed hundreds of thousands of guests to Israel. We understand that this is a hard and complicated issue and we appreciate everyone's perspective,"" Airbnb's Global Head of Policy and Communications Chris Lehane said in an emailed statement.
Erdan said Airbnb ""will have to explain why it is taking this discriminatory and racist line here in particular and not in other conflict zones in the world"".
Erdan, pointman in Israel's campaign against the international Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement that wants to isolate it over occupation of land Palestinians seek for a state, offered government legal advice to any hosts who want to sue Airbnb.
Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, urged the U.N. Human Rights Council to release a database of companies ""profiting from the Israeli colonial occupation"". 
Oded Revivi, mayor of the West Bank settlement of Efrat, said Airbnb had violated its own stated mission ""to bring people together in as many places as possible around the world"". 
Israel's Tourism Ministry said it was looking at options, including new taxation, for restricting Airbnb activities throughout Israel.
Airbnb's move came on the eve of the publication of a report by Human Rights Watch on tourist rental listings in Israeli settlements. The New York-based group hailed Airbnb's ""important recognition that such listings can’t square with its human rights responsibilities"".

Airbnb is considering an IPO next year after announcing in February that it would not make a public debut this year.

The jet, due to go into service in 2040, is expected to replace the Rafale, built by France's Dassault Aviation, and Germany's Eurofighters, made by a European consortium.
Parly said on Twitter that the agreement included the planned launch of a prototype or demonstrator of both the aircraft and the engine by the middle of next year.
""Decisive step today with the agreement to start the architecture and design studies and the launch of demonstrators (aircraft and engine) by mid-2019,"" Parly tweeted. ""It is advancing.""
Germany and France signed a memorandum of understanding in April and agreed that France would take the lead. The two governments have been at odds about future exports, while the companies involved are fighting over leadership of the system to integrate the jet with drones and other weapons.
Dassault and Airbus will shortly submit an unsolicited proposal work for initial conceptual work on the new fighter jet to German and French officials, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters last week.
The two companies agreed in principle in April to work together on the program, but say they need early funding so they can start work on new technologies required.
France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) and Germany's MTU Aero Engines are expected to join forces to develop the engine. French electronics firm Thales and European missile maker MBDA are also seeking a stake. 
A French military official told the International Fighter conference in Berlin last week that the two governments hoped to conclude an initial contract in January.
Bruno Fichefeux, head of future combat air systems at Airbus, told the conference he expected conceptual work on the program to begin soon, ""bilaterally or with Spain.""
Germany, France and Spain have completed separate studies on the next generation fighter. Spain has said it is considering joining the Franco-German program, but has also had discussions with a rival project launched by Britain in July.

The German defense minister had no immediate comment.

A majority of Scots voted to remain in the European Union in the referendum and Sturgeon's Scottish National Party, which runs a devolved administration in Edinburgh, has said it will vote against May's Brexit deal.
Defending the deal reached with the EU, May's office said after her meeting with Sturgeon: ""(It) will give Scottish businesses the clarity and certainty they need to protect jobs and living standards and see us take back control of our waters, improving the fortunes of our fishermen.""
Earlier, Sturgeon said she wanted to form a ""coalition of opposition"" to May's Brexit plan with the main opposition Labour and other parties.
She told the BBC she had held exploratory talks with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and, in a separate meeting, with other opposition party leaders.
She had agreed with Corbyn that May's deal was a bad one, and that ""no deal"" should not be the only alternative.
""The next stages of all of this have to be to look at what we can coalesce around in terms of alternatives,"" Sturgeon said.
Sturgeon has already said her 35 Scottish National Party (SNP) lawmakers at the Westminster British parliament will vote against the deal when it comes before the House of Commons. Labour has said it will not countenance a no-deal Brexit.

The appeal against the conviction, filed earlier this month, cited evidence of a police set-up and lack of proof of a crime. The lawyers did not specify when the Yangon-based court made its decision and there was no formal announcement from the court. Reuters was unable to contact the court outside office hours.
""It is confirmed that the case has been accepted,"" said lawyer L. Khun Ring Pan, a member of the defense team. ""We hope that the High Court will finally provide justice for Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo and declare them innocent.""
Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, were found guilty in September after a trial at a Yangon district court in a landmark case that has raised questions about Myanmar's progress towards democracy and sparked an outcry from diplomats and human rights advocates.
Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi said in September that the jailing of the reporters had nothing to do with freedom of expression. In comments made the week after their conviction, she said they had been sentenced for handling official secrets and ""were not jailed because they were journalists"".
Government spokesman Zaw Htay was not reachable for comment on Tuesday.
When lodging the appeal in early November, Reuters Editor-in-Chief Stephen J. Adler said: ""The trial court'sruling was wrong.
""In condemning them as spies, it ignored compelling evidence of a police set-up, serious due process violations, and the prosecution's failure to prove any of the key elements of the crime.""
Adler also said the court shifted the burden of proof from the prosecution to the Reuters reporters, and called on Myanmar to ""uphold its stated dedication to rule of law, freedom of the press, and democracy by ordering the release of our colleagues"".
In the next step of the appeal process, an appellate judge will take written and oral arguments from prosecution and defense lawyers before handing down a decision.
Before their arrest, the reporters had been working on a Reuters investigation into the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men and boys by security forces and local Buddhists in western Myanmar's Rakhine state during an army crackdown that began in August last year. The operation sent more than 700,000 people fleeing to Bangladesh.

During eight months of hearings, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo testified that two policemen they had not met before handed them papers rolled up in a newspaper during a meeting at a Yangon restaurant on Dec. 12. Almost immediately afterwards, they said, they were bundled into a car by plainclothes officers.

During a fiercely fought referendum on Scottish independence from the United Kingdom in 2014, one of the potential stumbling blocks for Scotland to rejoin the European Union was perceived to be the potential veto of EU member Spain, because of worries about its own secessionists in northeastern region Catalonia.
Spain's government, then headed by Conservatives, has changed since 2014 and is now headed by Socialist Pedro Sanchez. Scotland rejected independence by a 10-point margin in 2014 but since then support for a separate Scotland has stayed at around the same level, 45 percent, according to polls.
Asked if a Sanchez government would accept Scotland's EU application to join if Scotland left the United Kingdom and fulfilled the requirements of the UK constitution, Borrell said: ""Why not? If they leave Britain in accordance with their internal regulation, if Westminster agrees ...,""
""If Westminster (Britain's national parliament) agrees, why should we be against it? (...) I think the United Kingdom will split apart before Spain,"" he told Politico in an interview before a live audience.
Scotland's pro-independence Scottish National Party, the biggest party in Scotland, welcomed the comments, saying they destroyed a ""favored unionist scare-story"".

Britain's 52-48 percent 2016 vote to leave the European Union has called the future of the four-nation United Kingdom into question because England and Wales voted to leave but Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to stay.

KABUL (Reuters) - A suicide bomber blew himself up in a banqueting hall where Islamic religious scholars had gathered in the Afghan capital Kabul on Tuesday, killing more than 50 people, three government officials said.
Najib Danish, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, said more than 80 other people had been injured.
""A suicide bomber detonated his explosives inside a wedding hall where Islamic religious scholars had gathered to commemorate the anniversary of the Prophet Mohammad's birth,"" Danish said.
The banquet room is in the Uranus wedding hall, a complex housing several large reception rooms near Kabul airport.
""Hundreds of Islamic scholars and their followers had gathered to recite verses from the holy Quran to observe the Eid Milad-un-Nabi festival at the private banquet hall,"" said a spokesman for Kabul police.
Officials at Kabul’s Emergency Hospital said 30 ambulances had rushed to the scene and over 40 people were critically wounded.
Both the Sunni Taliban militant group and a local Islamic State affiliate have in the past attacked religious scholars aligned with the government -- who have decreed that suicide attacks are forbidden by Islam.
But the Taliban said in a statement that ""our men were not involved in the Kabul blast and we condemn the loss of human lives"".
The radical Sunni militant group Islamic State has mostly focused its major attacks on Afghan soil on Shi'ite Muslim sites of worship, regarding Shi'ites as heretics.
President Ashraf Ghani called Tuesday's attack ""un-Islamic"" and ""unforgivable"". He declared Wednesday a day of mourning.
Afghan security forces have struggled to prevent attacks by Islamist militants since most NATO combat troops withdrew in 2014.
Despite diplomatic efforts to end the 17-year war, in recent months the security situation has deteriorated sharply.

The Kabul government now controls only 56 percent of Afghan territory, down from 72 percent in 2015, according to a U.S. government report issued this month.

876,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 12:16PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Libya sees currency stabilizing next year, squeezing militia","By Aidan Lewis and Ulf Laessing
TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libya expects to end a long-running liquidity crisis by early 2019 as a foreign currency tax helps the official and black market exchange rates converge at less than 3 dinars to the dollar, the Tripoli-based deputy prime minister said.
The chasm between the two rates has enabled armed groups and their allies to reap vast profits to fund the conflict that has engulfed Libya since 2011, when a NATO-backed uprising overthrew Muammar Gaddafi after more than four decades in power.
Meanwhile ordinary Libyans, reliant on imports of everything from milk to cars, have seen living standards crumble.
Since 2014, Libya has had competing governments aligned with rival armed factions based in the capital Tripoli and the east.
The internationally recognized Tripoli government hopes its currency reforms will help restore confidence in the economy and chart a way out of the turmoil by putting the armed groups out of business, a main goal of U.N. efforts to stabilize Libya. 
Asked when the liquidity situation in the banks would be normalized, Ahmed Maiteeg told Reuters: ""By the beginning of February, beginning of next year, it will be part of the past.""
Once the rates converge and the supply of dinars and dollars is freed up, Libya will begin reducing fuel subsidies that cost the state up to $5 billion last year and have led to rampant smuggling to neighboring countries, Maiteeg said.
He also said state oil firm NOC, which has struggled to maintain oil fields amid funding shortages and blockages by armed groups, would get a development budget of $1.8 billion in 2019, as the wheels of the economy start turning with the flow of dollars. Other development projects would also be restarted. 
Between 2014 and 2017, the dinar fell by as much as 600 percent on the parallel black market, which has become the widely used benchmark, as oil production see-sawed and trust in the banking system collapsed. 
The official rate, used only by some state companies, has remained at 1.4 dinars.
To bridge the gap, the internationally recognized government in Tripoli slapped a 183 percent tax on commercial and private hard currency deals in September, bringing the effective official rate for such transactions to 3.9 dinars.
Together with a new allowance that allows Libyans to withdraw up to $10,000 annually using a credit card, this has helped bring down the parallel rate to 5.30 from between 6 and 7 two months ago, according to dealers' rates seen by Reuters.
BREAK EVEN
The government expects the black market rate to continue to fall as dollars continue to pour in from the card allowance and as more import letters of credit are opened. 
Spelling out details of the reforms for the first time, Maiteeg said Libya would nudge the effective official rate lower as the black market rate dropped.
""It will go down gradually until it reaches the break even or the right exchange rate,"" he said.
Libya used a similar mechanism to devalue its currency in the 1990s.
Maiteeg declined to give the future official rate, saying only that studies put a fair value at between 2 and 2.4 dinars. ""Much depends on oil exports and actual internal demand.""
When pressed whether the official rate would at least be less than 3 he said: ""Of course.""
After access to cash improves, the government will gradually draw down a fuel subsidy that has long been among the most generous in the world. A liter of petrol costs 0.15 dinars.
However, previous governments have tried to reform the subsidies but have faced resistance from the armed groups for whom smuggling has become a lucrative source of income - suggesting the militia will not roll over easily. 
The groups have also made vast profits through their control over banks and through scams linked to letters of credit (LCs)that grant dollars at the official exchange rate.
Maiteeg said letters that had been restricted due to falling dollar revenues and the import scams were now freely available at the 3.9 rate, and credit worth more than $1 billion was issued from Oct. 1-24. 
""It is open for everybody now so there is no need to have a militia, or pressure the central bank to have an LC. Anyone who wants an LC at 3.9 just apply and you will have it,"" he said.
The expected $1.8 billion in 2019 for oil firm NOC will boost production, Maiteeg said. ""This will improve the production of oil and this will improve the NOC pipelines.""
NOC and state power firm GECOL are exempt from the new foreign currency fee, while other state firms have to apply for exemptions. 
Maiteeg said that so far no foreign reserves had been spent on LCs, but the government was willing to spend them if necessary. 

Restarting more than 4,800 projects halted since 2011 will help create jobs, Maiteeg said. ""Many of these projects will be started in 2019,"" he said.

The investigation comes after the National Commission for Campaign Accounts and Political Financing (CNCCFP) was unable to trace some donations made to Macron's En Marche (On the Move) party by cheque and electronic transfer, the source added.
The unaccounted for funds represent a small fraction of Macron's campaign spending. According to the CNCCFP, Macron raised 16.8 million euros in campaign finances -- below the cap set by French law -- and spent almost all of it.
Macron's party did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
Paris prosecutors are also investigating alleged irregularities in the 2017 campaign spending of hard-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon. The former Trotskyist was interrogated by police and his headquarters raided last month in connection with the allegations.
""Will they also raid Macron's house? Will they confiscate his list of members and donors? Or will this be a case of double standards,"" Melenchon tweeted.

LONDON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Two of the Kremlin's most prominent critics joined forces on Tuesday to try to stop a Russian becoming the next president of international police organization Interpol, saying they feared Moscow would abuse the post to hunt down its detractors.
Interpol's general assembly is due to elect a new president on Wednesday after incumbent Meng Hongwei of China went missing in September. Beijing later said it had detained him in connection with a bribery probe.
The battle to succeed him turned political after Alexander Prokopchuk, a former major general in Russia's Ministry of the Interior, emerged as one of the favorites to get the job, a prospect that alarmed critics of President Vladimir Putin. 
Russian dissident and former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky on Tuesday gave a news conference in London alongside U.S.-born Kremlin critic Bill Browder at which both warned against Prokopchuk's election, saying it would make it easier for the Kremlin to manipulate Interpol. Moscow has rejected such claims.
""Appointing such a person to the head of the international policing organization would not only damage the reputation of all Interpol member states, but would carry a grave threat to those who may be considered potential victims of political persecution,"" said Khodorkovsky.
Putin freed Khodorkovsky in 2013 after he had spent a decade in jail for fraud, a charge Khodorkovsky said was fabricated to punish him for funding political opposition to Putin. The president has said he regards the businessman as a common thief.
Browder, the head of investment fund Hermitage Capital Management, has led a campaign to expose corruption and punish Russian officials he blames for the death of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky in 2009 in a Moscow prison.
""If a Russian is president of this organization the Russian will be acting on the instructions of Vladimir Putin,"" said Browder, who used to support the president before becoming one of his most implacable international critics. 
""To put his representative in charge of the most important international crime fighting organization is like putting the mafia in charge,"" said Browder.
Russian prosecutors said on Monday they suspected Browder of ordering a string of murders, including of Magnitsky, in a twist the financier dismissed as ludicrous.
'SMEAR CAMPAIGN'
On Monday, four U.S. senators jointly urged President Donald Trump to oppose Prokopchuk's candidacy and accused Russia of abusing Interpol to settle scores and harass dissidents by issuing warrants, known as red notices, for their arrest.
Browder was briefly detained by Spanish police in May on a Russian Interpol red notice that was then deemed invalid.
Politicians in Lithuania and Ukraine have urged their governments to quit Interpol if Prokopchuk is elected, while Britain has said it is backing his South Korean rival Kim Jong Yang, currently the organization's senior vice-president.
The Kremlin said on Tuesday that opposition to Prokopchuk's candidacy by U.S. senators amounted to election meddling.
""This is probably a certain kind of interference in the electoral process of an international organization,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
Russia's Ministry of the Interior defended Prokopchuk.
""We see a campaign aimed at discrediting the Russian candidate,"" it said in a statement, complaining about what it called the unacceptable politicisation of Interpol.
""Alexander Prokopchuk has many years of experience working in the law enforcement sphere and is currently Interpol's vice-president... which confirms the trust and high esteem in which his work in this international organization is held."" 
If elected, he would carry out his duties solely in Interpol's own interests, the ministry said.

Interpol's 194 member states each have a vote in Wednesday's election in Dubai, it said on its website. The winner will serve the last two years of Meng Hongwei's original four-year mandate.

BUDAPEST/SKOPJE (Reuters) - Former Macedonian prime minister Nikola Gruevski, who fled abroad after being sentenced to two years in prison on corruption-related charges, said on Tuesday that he had been granted political asylum in Hungary. 
Macedonian police had issued an arrest warrant for Gruevski, who resigned in 2016 after a decade in power, after he failed to show up to begin his sentence, following a Nov. 9 court ruling against his motion for a reprieve.
""Today the Republic of Hungary, an EU and NATO member state, responded positively to my previously submitted request to obtain political asylum due to political persecution in the Republic of Macedonia,"" Gruevski wrote on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
Earlier on Tuesday, the Hungarian newspaper Magyar Idok reported without naming its sources that the Hungarian Immigration and Asylum Office had established that the legal conditions to give Gruevski asylum had been met.
Officials at the immigration agency were unavailable for comment. A government spokesman said Hungary ""has been in compliance with the...rules"" with respect to Gruevski's case, without elaborating. 
Prime Minister Viktor Orban supported the fellow right-wing nationalist Gruevski in the run-up to Macedonia's 2017 election and praised his party's efforts to halt migrants passing through the Balkans to western Europe.
Orban's office earlier said it considered Gruevski's asylum request to be ""solely a legal issue"" to be handled by the competent authority.
The Macedonian Justice Ministry said it would send a request for Gruevski's extradition to Budapest. 

""The government expects that the authorities in Budapest will unconditionally accept the request for extradition and in accordance with international law, as a member state of NATO and the EU, will facilitate the return of Gruevski to Macedonia,"" the government in Skopje said in a statement.

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Members of the global chemical weapons watchdog on Tuesday overwhelmingly rejected a Russian-led push to undercut new powers that allow the agency to point the finger of blame for the use of banned toxic munitions in Syria.
The full membership of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons voted 99 to 27 in favour of passing an increased budget for 2019, which will partly fund the Western-backed new powers, and rejected proposals by Russia and Iran aimed at blocking it.
The votes came at a time of heightened tension between Russia, whose forces support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and the West over systematic use of chemical weapons in the Syrian war.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said giving the OPCW additional powers overstepped the boundaries of its founding treaty, the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention.
The new powers ""of a prosecutor are a gross violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, decisions of the UN Security Council and contrary to the position of the majority of states parties to the convention,"" he was quoted by Sputnik News as saying.
Dutch authorities say they disrupted an attempted hack into the Hague-based OPCW in April, when the watchdog was looking into both the attack on ex-spy Sergei Skripal in Britain and chemical strikes in Syria which the West blames on Assad.
Scores of attacks with sarin gas and chlorine have been carried out in the Syrian conflict by government forces and rebel groups, according to a joint United Nations-OPCW investigation.
OPCW members on Tuesday voted down a Chinese-Russian proposal to block the new team mandated with assigning blame for attacks in Syria, a power that had been with a joint United Nations-OPCW investigation until its extension was vetoed by Russia last year.
China, which voted against the budget, called for an end to the ""present atmosphere of polarity and politicization"".
Russia had lobbied strongly among OPCW members to win a reversal of a decision in June to adopt a British-led proposal to set up a team to identify organisations or individuals responsible for chemical weapons attacks in Syria.
Opponents said allocating new powers to identify perpetrators will create more division at the OPCW, where Russia, much like at the United Nations, has blocked efforts to take action against its close ally Syria.
""This organisation will be left in shambles,"" said Magzhan Ilyassov, Kazakhstan's ambassador to the OPCW, who supports Russia's position. He said the new team should not be funded and that the OPCW ""will continue to disintegrate and fall apart.""
Under the June decision, a new team of 10 specialists will start work on Syria early next year.. The team's mandate will later be widened to identify those responsible for attacks worldwide.
The OPCW's new chief, Fernando Arias, on Tuesday won support for a budget increase of 3.6 percent to just below 70 million euros ($80 million), 2-2.5 million euros of which will partly fund the new team.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Chicago police on Tuesday were seeking a motive for a shooting rampage outside and inside a hospital late Monday that left four people dead, including the gunman, a physician who was his former girlfriend and a police officer, officials said.
The gunman, Juan Lopez, 32, was the former boyfriend of Dr. Tamara O'Neal, 38, who he shot and killed outside Mercy Hospital on Monday, Officer Jose Jara of the Chicago Police Department said. 
Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson on Monday described that first killing as an act of domestic violence.
""There’s no doubt in my mind that all of those officers who responded were heroes and they saved a lot of lives because we just don't know how much damage he (the gunman) was prepared to do,"" Johnson said.
After killing O'Neal, Lopez fired at arriving police officers with a handgun then entered the hospital and exchanged gunfire for several minutes with officers who followed him, Johnson said. 
Lopez also died but it was not immediately clear if he shot himself or was struck by a police officer's bullet. 
Officer Samuel Jimenez, who joined the Chicago police force last year, died during the gunfight, officials said. Jimenez, 28, was married with children and was the second city officer killed on duty this year. 
O'Neal had worked as a resident and emergency room physician at Mercy Hospital for about two years and was heavily involved in her church, the Chicago Tribune reported. 
The newspaper cited hospital employees as saying O'Neal was Lopez's former girlfriend. One witness said Lopez was harassing O'Neal before the attack. 
""I knew her, trained with her, saved lives with her and tonight, tried to save her life,"" John Purakal a doctor at the University of Chicago Medicine medical school and health system, wrote on Twitter. ""Tonight, I broke down in front of my coworkers when we lost her, and tonight I held hands with her mother in prayer. Tonight, we lost a beautiful, resilient, passionate doc.""
Doctors and patients fled the hospital during the attack. 
Pharmacy assistant Dayna Less, 24, was shot and killed as she left an elevator, Johnson said. Another officer was spared injury when a bullet lodged itself in his gun holster. 

In Denver, another shooting left one person dead and four wounded on Monday. At least one suspect remained at large after the shooting on a downtown street corner. Police said the injuries were believed to be non-life-threatening.

885,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 10:51AM ET</span>",Cows with or without horns? Swiss to vote on Sunday,"By Stephanie Nebehay
PERREFITTE, Switzerland (Reuters) - Switzerland votes this Sunday on an issue of national importance that has divided the Alpine country - whether to subsidize farmers who let their cows' and goats' horns grow naturally.
The referendum on preserving the ""dignity of livestock"" was initiated by farmer Armin Capaul, 66, a self-described rebel. He says that ""listening"" to his cows inspired his nine-year campaign for cash to fund the extra grazing space horned animals need and which he hopes will reduce dehorning.
""We must respect cows as they are. Leave them their horns. When you look at them they always hold their head high and are proud. When you remove the horns, they are sad,"" he told Reuters on his small farm in northwestern Switzerland. 
Three-quarters of Swiss cows, who are a national symbol and tourist attraction, are dehorned or genetically hornless. 
Capaul, who says horns help cows communicate and regulate their body temperature, wants a 190 Swiss franc ($191.65) annual subsidy per horned animal for farmers. 
When political lobbying failed, he collected over 100,000 signatures to trigger a national vote.
The latest poll says the vote is too close to call.
His campaign is likely to garner support from those who oppose dehorning - burning a sedated calf's horn buds with a red-hot iron. Critics say it is painful and unnatural but supporters liken it to castrating cats or dogs and argue it is a safety issue.
""In Switzerland, cows have never been talked about as much as now,"" said Capaul, a distinctive figure with a long gray beard and hand-knitted red hat, whose alternative approach has made him a media star and a household name. 
His campaign is opposed by the government, which says it would drain up to 30 million francs from its 3 billion franc annual agricultural budget, and is a burden on the constitution.
""In Switzerland it's usual for issues to be brought to the people for a vote - every important question or less important question,"" Swiss Economy Minister Johann Schneider-Ammann said. 
Some farmers are opposed.
""Our current system in the stable has advantages, the cows get along better with each other. If cows have horns, the danger of injuries to the animals and humans is greater,"" said Stefan Gilgen, whose 48 cows provide 1,000 liters of milk daily to Swiss dairy Emmi AG.
""Each farm should decide for itself. We have other problems in agriculture.""
In Vaud canton, Reuters watched veterinarian Jean-Marie Surer dehorn three calves, anaesthetising each one before the procedure that causes smoke and a burning odor.
""Using a very hot iron for seven seconds, I burned the skin and blood vessels which irrigate the horn bud, so it won't grow,"" Surer said as he applied disinfectant.

""It is painless, they didn't move even an ear.""

ZURICH (Reuters) - An investigation into the crash of a vintage plane in the Swiss Alps in August that killed 20 people has so far found no technical defects that caused the tragedy, the country's transport safety agency said on Tuesday.
Three Austrians and 17 Swiss were aboard the Junker Ju-52 aircraft when it crashed on Aug. 4 in the mountainous canton of Grissons. The 1930s-era military aircraft was used by tourist flight operator JU-Air.
Some parts of the three-engined plane, including a portion of its wing, showed signs of corrosion and insufficient documentation of some modifications over the years may have posed risks, the Swiss Transportation Safety Investigation Board (STSIB) said in a 32-page interim report. 
However, no concrete cause of the accident has been discovered so far, the STSIB said. It is not expected to complete its investigation before the middle of 2019.
""There were no indications through the date of publication of this interim report that pre-existing technical defects would have caused the accident,"" the board said.
Founded in 1982, JU-Air offers sightseeing flights with German-made Ju-52 aircraft decommissioned by the Swiss Air Force. 
After suspending services for two weeks following the crash, JU-Air resumed flights of its other two aircraft. 
Accident investigators' discovery of corrosion on the crashed plane has now prompted the temporary grounding of those planes, though JU-Air said the planes were already undergoing annual maintenance after the end of the summer flight season.
""JU-Air plans to re-start operations, as scheduled, in spring 2019,"" the company said in a statement, adding it plans to add a third Ju-52 plane next year. It is awaiting a special permit to fly that aircraft from its current location, in the German city of Moenchengladbach, to Switzerland for additional maintenance work.

SARAJEVO (Reuters) - A pro-Russian Serb nationalist who wants the Bosnian army dismantled and pro-NATO Croat and Bosniak supporters of a multi-ethnic Bosnia were sworn in on Tuesday as new members of the state presidency, with rivalry looming among them. 
Their different views of Bosnia's place in the world seem certain to block decision-making in the state body which is responsible for drawing up and conducting foreign policy under peace accords that ended the Bosnian war in the 1990s.
Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik, long an advocate of the Serb region seceding from Bosnia which he has labeled an ""impossible state"", took a solemn oath pledging to respect the constitution, the Dayton peace deal and the rights of Bosnia's people.
But he made clear that the interests of Serbs and their autonomous region over which he has presided for the past eight years would be his priority.
After the 1992-95 war which killed 100,000 people, Bosnia was divided into a Serb Republic and a Federation of Croat-dominated and Bosniak-dominated cantons, linked via the tripartite presidency and a weak central government.
Dodik, who will hold the rotating chairmanship of the presidency over the next eight months, called on other presidency members to work together to speed up Bosnia's integration with the EU.
""The time when we were at war has long passed and this is a serious opportunity to progress forward,"" he said during his inauguration speech. 
Though Dodik says EU membership is a priority, he opposes any moves to join NATO and instead wants closer ties with Russia and Serbia. [L8N1XU5A1] 
But Zeljko Komsic, a moderate Croat who is serving a third term in the presidency, and Sefik Dzaferovic, a Bosniak member who comes from the largest Muslim Bosniak SDA party, said they would push for integration into the U.S.-led military alliance.
""The future of Bosnia-Herzegovina is in the membership of NATO and EU, these are the guarantees of security and prosperity for its citizens,"" Komsic said in his speech.

TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Hundreds of Libyan Sufis packed the narrow streets of Tripoli's walled old city to celebrate the Prophet Mohammad's birthday on Tuesday, chanting hymns to the beat of drums and cymbals.
Dressed in traditional robes, participants said it was the biggest turnout for the celebration of Mawlid in the Libyan capital for several years after poor security and fears of attack prevented previous large processions.  
Mawlid is an important event for Sufis, whose spirituality is an integral part of North African Islam. 
Sufism, a mystical strain among both Sunnis and Shi'ites, dates back to Islam's early days. Besides the standard prayers, Sufi devotions include singing hymns, chanting the names of God or dancing to heighten awareness of the divine.
""Many more people have joined this year. In the past two years few came after attacks from extremists,"" said Siddiq Abuhadena, an engineer.
Sufi worshippers said they were wary of a rise of Salafists and extremists in Libya opposing their traditions.
Tensions have grown in recent years between Sufis and Salafists, a group influenced by Saudi Wahhabis and other ultra-conservative foreign Islamists.
Salafists following a Saudi preacher, Rabi al-Madkhali, have gained ground in Libya since the 1990s. 
Their social influence and military power has increased since a 2011 uprising that toppled former Libyan ruler Muammar Gaddafi, leading to widespread insecurity and intermittent armed conflict. Dozens of Sufi shrines have been destroyed or damaged. 
Security in Tripoli has stabilized in the past two months following 10 days of heavy clashes. 
After processing through the old city, marchers spilled out onto Martyrs Square (NYSE:SQ), known under Gaddafi as Green Square, where the former leader used to address his supporters.
""There are some who want to ban the celebration of Prophet Mohammad. They say the Prophet Mohammad did not celebrate his birth. They are lying,"" said Abdullah Abubanun, head of a Zawiya, or Islamic school.

Dozens of Sufi shrines including mosques, tombs and libraries have been destroyed or damaged by hardliners since 2011 across Libya, Human Rights Watch said in a report a year ago.

ROME (Reuters) - Italian magistrates on Tuesday accused the Doctors without Borders (MSF) charity of illegally dumping toxic waste at ports in southern Italy in what MSF said was an attempt to undermine migrant rescue efforts. 
Magistrates ordered the MSF-operated ship Aquarius, which has saved thousands of migrants since 2016, to be impounded but the charity denied any wrongdoing and accused Italy of seeking to criminalize humanitarian search and rescue missions.
The Aquarius has been blocked at the French port of Marseilles since September, after failing to find a country willing to register its trips to the southern Mediterranean.
It was not immediately clear if French authorities would impound the ship.
The public prosecutor's office in Catania, Sicily, said it believed crew on the Aquarius, and its sister ship VOS Prudence, had illegally dumped potentially dangerous medical waste among ordinary rubbish between January, 2017 and May, 2018.
It said in a statement 24,000 kg (52,900 lb) of suspect waste, including potentially hazardous medical matter, was handed over to local authorities at several ports in Italy avoiding costly safe disposal procedures.
Such material included migrants' clothes, food and ""infectious sanitary waste"", it added.
The prosecutors said the ship operators knew the migrants' clothes could transmit viruses contracted during their journeys. They added that cases of scabies, HIV, meningitis and respiratory infections had been found amongst the migrants.
ACCOUNTS FROZEN 
By failing to declare possibly dangerous materials, the ships' operators avoided about 460,000 euros ($526,000) of waste disposal costs, prosecutors said. They ordered that this sum be immediately frozen in the accounts of the charities.
Some 24 people, including two Italian shipping agents and the Russian captain of the Aquarius, have been placed under investigation in the case, prosecutors said. 
MSF and SOS Mediterranee, which works alongside MSF, said they had always followed standard procedures when disposing of waste after trips looking for migrants off the coast of Libya.
""This is an extreme, worrying effort to stop at all costs our search and rescue activity in the sea,"" Karline Kleijer, head of emergencies at MSF, said in a statement. 
The SOS Mediterranee charity called on France to ""show restraint"" in the face of the Italian investigation.
The Italian government has led a crackdown against Mediterranean rescue ships since taking office in June, denying them access to local ports following the arrival of almost 650,000 people from North Africa since 2014.
Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, who heads the far-right League party, welcomed Tuesday's move by Catania magistrates.

""I did well to block the NGO ships. I stopped not only the traffic of illegal immigrants but, from what it seems, also that of toxic waste,"" he added.

Approved in July by all 193 U.N. member nations except the United States, the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration addresses issues such as how to protect people who migrate, integrate them into new countries or safety return them home.
Drafted following the biggest influx of migrants into Europe since World War Two, most fleeing war or poverty in the Middle East and Africa, the non-binding pact is due to be adopted next month by heads of government at a meeting in Morocco.
Poland said it would not be endorsing the document.
""(It) doesn't meet Polish demands regarding strong guarantees for countries to have the right to independently decide (who) they choose to accept,"" the government in Warsaw said in a statement. 
Poland's ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) has maintained strong anti-migrant rhetoric since it took office in 2015, and Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki indicated earlier this month he was likely to reject the pact. 
An estimated one million Ukrainian migrants live and work in Poland.
Hungary, Czech Republic and Bulgaria have already rejected the pact, and Austria has said it does not plan to adopt it either.
In Bratislava, Slovakia's Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini said he was concerned his country might be required to take in more migrants than it wanted to.
""Our red lines are obligations that would limit our sovereignty to decide about accepting migrants,"" he told reporters after a government meeting.
His foreign minister, who oversaw the drafting of the pact last year while serving as President of the U.N. General Assembly, threatened to quit the government if Slovakia rejected it.
Miroslav Lajcak said the issue was ""being hijacked by populists, xenophobes and nationalists,"" and if Pellegrini's leftist ruling Smer party did not trust him, ""I can't be the minister of foreign affairs.""

(Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has accused a Venezuelan television mogul of bribing officials in the South American country and helping them launder the funds through assets in the United States, according to charges made public this week.
Raul Gorrin, owner of Venezuelan television channel Globovision and insurance firm Seguros La Vitalicia, was charged in an indictment unsealed on Monday in federal court in West Palm Beach, Florida, with violating U.S. anti-corruption laws in efforts to win contracts to carry out currency exchange operations for the government.
The indictment was filed under seal in August after prosecutors said it was necessary to protect the ""integrity of the ongoing investigation."" 
Gorrin was declared a fugitive in September, and the charges were unsealed on Monday after prosecutors said it would help law enforcement arrest him, court records showed.
Venezuela's exchange controls, created under late President Hugo Chavez, have for 15 years sold heavily subsidized dollars through state currency agencies or government auctions. 
But dollars on the black market have fetched at least double and sometimes 10 times more, allowing the well-connected to buy cut-rate dollars and resell them at a huge profit.
The mechanism has been one of the principal forms of illicit enrichment under the ruling Socialist Party. U.S. federal prosecutors over the last year have issued a string of indictments of Venezuelan officials for using the U.S. financial system to launder the proceeds of those operations.
According to the indictment, between 2008 and 2017, Gorrin facilitated more than $150 million in bribe payments to multiple officials in Venezuela's treasury for the right to participate in the currency deals. Much of the money was wired from Swiss bank accounts to accounts in Florida, prosecutors said.
Gorrin, 49, allegedly also bought officials jets, yachts, ""champion horses"" and luxury watches in Florida and Texas. 
A biography on Gorrin's personal website describes him as a salsa-loving ""humanist,"" lawyer and businessman. He bought a 25 percent stake in an insurer that would later be known as La Vitalicia in 2008, 10 years after Chavez came to power. 
Globovision overhauled coverage and softened criticism of Chavez's successor, Nicolas Maduro, after Gorrin purchased the channel in 2013, reporters said at the time. (https://reut.rs/2Ag9lMv)
Neither Globovision nor La Vitalicia responded to requests for comment. Gorrin's defense attorney, Howard Srebnick, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Gorrin's whereabouts were not immediately clear. He faces a maximum penalty of 45 years in prison if found guilty. 
In a separate case last month, a former finance executive at Venezuela's state-run oil company PDVSA pled guilty to taking bribes and attempting to launder $12 million of the illicit payments, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern (NYSE:SO) district of Florida said.

The accusation marked growing tensions between elements in the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF) - a movement that has dominated Ethiopia for decades - and new reformist prime minister Abiy Ahmed who has upended politics with a string of radical reforms.
At least 79 security officers, officials, businessmen and women, many of them Tigrayan, have been arrested since last week - under what the government said was a clamp-down on corruption and mistreatment of prisoners.
Amnesty International and other rights groups have welcomed the arrests. But TPLF chair Debretsion Gebremichael said on Monday the arrests ordered under ""the pretext of corruption and human rights are being used to attack Tigrayans"".
The prime minister’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Debretsion’s remarks.
Abiy's rise - as Ethiopia's first leader from the majority Oromo group - had transformed decades-old hierarchies in the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) coalition that was founded by the TPLF and came to power in 1991.
Soon after Abiy was inaugurated in April, he made peace with long-time foe Eritrea and started pushing reforms he said were meant to rein in the military and security services and limit their involvement in the economy - changes that have been largely welcomed by Western powers. 
The TPLF's Debretsion did not spell out who he thought was behind the arrests, that were announced by the government's attorney general. ""There is a foreign involvement in the process. Thus, it is unacceptable,"" he said, without giving further details.
Debretsion picked out last week's arrest of Kinfe Dagnew, a Tigrayan major general in the army and former chief executive of the METEC military-led conglomerate.
""While Kinfe was arrested peacefully, they tied him handcuffs. This is a political attack,"" Debretsion told a news conference.
""While they should have gone after an individual, they went after an ethnic group and a party,"" he said in comments aired by Dimtsi Woyane TV.
Kinfe and others appeared in court but have not been charged or entered any pleas. There have been no statements from them or lawyers representing them.

The comments by MHP leader Devlet Bahceli, a parliamentary ally of President Tayyip Erdogan, amounted to the fiercest Turkish criticism of the Saudi monarchy since Khashoggi was killed on Oct. 2 by Saudi agents at the kingdom's Istanbul consulate.
President Tayyip Erdogan has said the killing was ordered at the ""highest levels"" of the Saudi government but has not directly accused its de facto leader, Prince Mohammed. Saudi Arabia has denied that the prince ordered Khashoggi's killing.
In a speech to his Nationalist Movement Party on Tuesday, Bahceli said Saudi leaders had resorted to terrorist methods.
""I ask you, what difference remains between Saudi Arabia's administration and the mentality of Osama bin Laden? What separates this country from al Qaeda?"" Bahceli said. ""The circle is closing in for the crown prince, the paths of escape and salvation are closing.""
Bahceli's MHP supported Erdogan in Turkey's presidential election in June, helping him secure a narrow first-round victory. Its alliance with Erdogan's AK Party also ensured a parliamentary majority for the AKP.
The CIA believes Crown Prince Mohammed ordered Khashoggi's killing, sources familiar with the matter said on Friday - an assessment described by U.S. President Donald Trump as possible, but very premature. 
A source familiar with the CIA's assessment said it was based largely on circumstantial evidence relating to the prince's central role in running the Saudi government.
Saudi Arabia's foreign minister said on Tuesday his country categorically rejects allegations against the crown prince, saying they had no basis in truth.
Last week, after Riyadh offered numerous contradictory explanations for Khashoggi’s disappearance, the Saudi public prosecutor's office said he had been killed, after a struggle, by lethal injection and his body dismembered.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Loss-making South African arms maker Denel has a problem as it fights to survive. Its potential savior is Saudi Arabia, now drawing fierce criticism following the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
But after being mismanaged for years and tainted by a far-reaching influence-peddling scandal, state-owned Denel now needs the kind of help that the deep-pocketed Saudis can provide.
Reuters analyzed five years of South African arms export data, spoke to former and current Denel employees and obtained internal Denel presentations on plans to rescue the company.
What emerged is that Saudi Arabia and its allies account for almost half of South Africa's recent arms exports and a significant portion of future orders.
So rejecting Riyadh's $1 billion offer could severely hamper efforts to save Denel, which relies on foreign sales for more than 60 percent of its revenue.
Saudi Arabia is seeking a broad partnership with Denel that would include acquisition of the company's minority stake in a joint venture with Germany's Rheinmetall.
The Saudis - on a drive to build a domestic arms industry as traditional suppliers worry about its human rights record - are keen to close the deal by the end of next month. A source with knowledge of its offer said the kingdom could take its business elsewhere if that does not happen.
Some Denel employees are also keen on a tie-up, seeing it as the only way to rescue the firm, which is struggling to pay salaries. But some South African officials are concerned about doing business with Saudi Arabia.
""Denel depends on the deal. The entire industry depends on the deal,"" said Helmoed Heitman, a defense analyst. ""I think it's 50/50. The pragmatists want to go in, but the Khashoggi thing is bad PR.""
With President Cyril Ramaphosa and the ruling African National Congress facing an election next year, the deal promises to become a political issue. 
South Africa's main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, says the Saudi offer should be rejected.
""Putting our state defense firm at the disposal of a murderous despot would make the whole nation complicit in the human rights atrocities of the regime of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman,"" said DA lawmaker Stevens Mokgalapa. 
""That there are negotiations to consider this at all is an indictment of the approach of the Ramaphosa government to international human rights violations.""
Saudi Arabia denies that the crown prince ordered Khashoggi's killing.
APARTHEID INDUSTRY
Denel owes its existence to South Africa's own dark past. 
Its direct forebear, Armscor, was forced to produce nearly all of its own defense and security hardware in response to sanctions on the apartheid government.
It's that expertise that is now so attractive to Saudi Arabia as it seeks to build its own industry, Andreas Schwer, head of the Saudi state defense company, SAMI, told Reuters.
""South Africa is very integrated in their capabilities because they had to become quite independent,"" he said last month. ""We believe South Africa can offer us more than just products. They can help us on this journey.""
Denel - formed in 1992 - only started to turn a regular profit from 2011 after being restructured several times. But its financial position remained weak as it used profits from some divisions to subsidize others.
In 2016 senior management became embroiled in a corruption scandal involving friends of former president Jacob Zuma, the Gupta brothers. In response, banks pulled lending. The company recorded a 1.7 billion rand ($122 million) loss - its first in eight years - in the financial year that ended in March.
Denel's new management is working on a turnaround plan to secure new funding and exit some loss-making business units, like satellite development and its Pretoria Metal Pressings foundry, a presentation seen by Reuters showed.
It also wants to cut its salary bill by 20 percent and achieve cost savings of between 157 million and 608 million rand in each of the next five years, the presentation showed.
But it missed out on additional state funds in last month's budget, and labor unions reject wage cuts. A cash crunch has become so dire that the company cannot provide toilet paper to some employees, and production lines sometimes stand idle as payments to suppliers fall behind.
Members of the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa, which represents a quarter of Denel's 4,000-strong workforce, marched to the public enterprises ministry this month to demand a 7 billion rand ($500 million) bailout.
Insiders say even that would be little more than a stopgap.
""The machine has stopped,"" a former Denel executive told Reuters. ""I can't see how Denel can pull itself up by its bootstraps without an equity partner.""
'OUR COMMON RELIGION'
Ramaphosa appeared open to bringing in a partner to bolster Denel when he acknowledged the Saudi bid earlier this month.
Foreign Minister Lindiwe Sisulu said any deliberations over a potential deal would be based on South Africa's values.
""Our common religion is human rights. We have suffered too long to ever veer away from that religious belief,"" she told journalists last month.
But Khashoggi's death has created a dilemma. 
Asked about the killing, Ramaphosa told reporters: ""We are hoping that they will deal with the matter speedily so that the truth will come out.""
The United States has announced sanctions against those believed to have been directly involved. Germany is halting arms exports to Saudi Arabia until it explains the killing. 
It's the kind of backlash that Riyadh - under fire since 2015 over its war against in Yemen - has long feared and it explains why the government is building its own arms industry. It's also why it has turned to South Africa.
""South Africa's export policy was always stable and robust ... and we need very reliable partners on the political side, on the export policy side. Partners who do not change their minds,"" SAMI CEO Schwer said before Khashoggi's murder.
In 2013, South African sales to coalition allies Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates made up around 9 percent of total arms exports, a Reuters analysis of data shows.
Since the Yemen war began, South Africa has sold the two countries military hardware - armored vehicles, sniper rifles, bombs, mortars and surveillance equipment - worth 4.6 billion rand, or 44 percent of total arms exports. 
But what might have appeared a natural arrangement to save Denel now appears fraught.
Despite apparent government enthusiasm to do business with Saudi Arabia and Denel's pressing need for financial rescue, not everyone is open to the kingdom's overtures.
Responding to Reuters publication of details of the Saudi bid, Denel chairperson Monhla Hlahla rejected out of hand a sell-off of Denel's stake in Rheinmetall Denel Munition.
""The board of Denel is selling neither Denel, or RDM. I want to be clear about that,"" she told a local television network. 
News of the Saudi overtures has also provoked an outcry on South African social media, but a senior ANC source said the government would not be rushed into a decision.
""It's a strategic asset, so I would be wary about dealing with any foreign country, be that the Saudis or anyone else,"" the source said.
But despite Ramaphosa's assertion that Saudi Arabia was only one of several suitors, no others have come forward publicly. 
""A billion dollars over two or three years would turn around Denel,"" said Heitman, the defense analyst. ""The longer we wait, the less Denel is worth. People will leave and that's where the value lies.""

899,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 08:12AM ET</span>",Spain to vote against Brexit accord if text on Gibraltar not changed: PM,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spain will vote against the European Union's draft Brexit deal on Sunday unless it is modified to make clear that the future of the disputed British territory of Gibraltar relies on talks between Madrid and London, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said.
Spain's demands on Gibraltar are the latest push by EU states to obtain more on national interests ahead of Sunday's summit of EU leaders, but diplomats said there was little concern these would scupper prospects for a deal.
""As of today, if there are no changes with respect to Gibraltar, Spain will vote no to the agreement on Brexit,"" Sanchez said during a conference in Madrid on Tuesday. 
According to EU rules, the withdrawal treaty is adopted by qualified majority and not unanimity. So a single state like Spain cannot block it. The EU's executive said it was aware of Spain's concerns and it expected the issue to be resolved. 
A small peninsula on Spain's southern coast and a British territory since 1713, Gibraltar is a major point of contention in Anglo-Spanish relations. Spain has long claimed sovereignty over it.
Gibraltar is due to leave the European Union along with the United Kingdom in March, although 96 percent of its population voted in the 2016 referendum to remain in the bloc.
SUNDAY SUMMIT
While Spain last week initially welcomed a protocol on Gibraltar in the draft Brexit agreement, Foreign Minister Josep Borrell on Monday said there was confusion over Gibraltar in the main body of the agreement.
That needed to be clarified in the broader political declaration on the new relationship between the EU and the UK, Borrell said. Sanchez reinforced that message on Tuesday.
""If on Sunday in the @EUCouncil the Brexit deal does not recognise that Gibraltar's situation must be negotiated directly between Spain and the United Kingdom, this government will not accept it,"" Sanchez said on Twitter.
""If this government, which is a pro-European government, finds itself in this situation, this means that someone in Brussels didn't do their work well,"" he said, adding that Spain had offered various drafting options both to Britain and to EU negotiator Michel Barnier.
In Brussels, EU spokesman Margaritis Schinas said the bloc agreed last year that ""after the UK leaves the Union, no agreement between the EU and the UK may apply to the territory of Gibraltar without the agreement between Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom"".
Diplomats in Brussels expected the issue to be resolved by adding more such language in the withdrawal agreement and the declaration on post-Brexit ties between the EU and Britain by Sunday, when they are due to be presented to EU leaders for approval.
Gibraltar borders the Andalusia region where regional elections key for Sanchez's socialist party as well as his main opponents are held on Dec. 2. Several thousands Spaniards cross the border every day to jobs in the territory. 
Gibraltar's Chief Minister Fabian Picardo on Monday issued a statement regretting the Spanish position.

""It does not come as a surprise that Madrid should seek to raise new Gibraltar issues at the last minute on our negotiations to leave the EU. Raising issue at the 11th hour is a well-known tactic that has been used by Spain in the past while were in the EU,"" Picardo said.

MANILA (Reuters) - Chinese leader Xi Jinping visited the Philippines on Tuesday to further strategic gains made under President Rodrigo Duterte, who hailed a ""new impetus"" behind a relationship that his massive infrastructure ambitions could depend on.
Xi's visit comes two years after the maverick Duterte declared he was reorienting his foreign policy away from longtime ally the United States and toward China, despite decades of mistrust and bitter maritime disputes with Beijing.
Duterte is facing criticism from opponents for making too many political concessions to China in return for billions of dollars of pledged Chinese loans and investments that have yet to materialize, or be committed to formally.
The two leaders on Tuesday oversaw 29 agreements of sorts, many of them broad or vague, from cooperating in education, culture and industrial park development to jointly promoting infrastructure, agriculture cooperatives and establishing sanitation protocols for shipping coconuts.
Duterte said there was ""a deepening trust and confidence"" between them and he and Xi had discussed increasing trade and investment, and China's involvement in his signature $180 billion ""Build, Build, Build"" infrastructure program.
""With mutual respect, sincerity and adherence to sovereign equality, I will continue to work closely with President Xi,"" he said.
However, of the 38 Philippine projects earmarked for Chinese involvement two years ago, only four were among the commitments made on Tuesday.
One was approval for a Chinese loan for building a $232.5 million dam, another a hiring of a consultancy for a rail plan. The other two were to start feasibility studies on an inter-island bridge, and a highway in Duterte's home province. 
Xi said he and Duterte would elevate their relationship to one of ""comprehensive strategic cooperation"", adding that they had many common interests in the South China Sea, and would continue to ""manage contentious issues"".
SUBMISSIVE STRATEGY
Duterte's management of those issues has frustrated nationalists, who say he has been submissive in refusing to criticize China's military buildup, or asking for its compliance with a 2016 arbitration award that invalidated its claim to almost the entire waterway.
Though public opinion is largely supportive of Duterte's presidency, surveys consistently show reservations about his China policy and his personal dislike of the United States.
A Social Weather Stations poll of 1,200 Filipinos released on the eve of Xi's visit showed 84 percent felt it was wrong not to oppose China's militarization of its manmade islands in the South China Sea.
It also showed trust in the United States remained ""very good"", but China was considered ""poor"".
Asked about that survey, presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo said Duterte's strategy was to avoid a conflict while reaping the rewards of improved business.
""They are not aware of the real geopolitics in the region. The president is a very cautious diplomat,"" Panelo told news channel ANC.
""Rather than provoke, he'd rather talk with them and get some trade relations that will benefit this country.""
In comments prior to the two leaders' meeting, Panelo accepted the slow pace of China delivering on its investment pledges, but said he expected Duterte to be brave enough ""to exert pressure"" on Xi.
""Knowing the man, he'll do that, he's that kind of person,"" Panelo said.
Duterte has heaped praise on Xi for his economic support, but some analysts say he is being exploited.

Other Philippine experts say delays in securing Chinese credit could be a blessing given the potential debt burden, echoing a warning delivered by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A Singapore lawmaker hit out at Facebook (O:FB) on Tuesday, saying it had reneged on a promise to help rein in fake news and calling for tougher regulations, which the social media firm has cautioned against. 
The criticism follows Facebook's refusal this month of a government request to remove an online article about the city-state's banks and Malaysia's scandal-linked 1MDB state fund, which the government said was false and malicious.
""Facebook has...given assurances that it would work closely with the Singapore authorities to swiftly address online falsehoods. And yet, when there is an actual falsehood that attacks Singapore, Facebook refuses to remove the content,"" Edwin Tong told parliament.
It was not immediately clear what assurances he was referring to.
""It (Facebook) will allow itself to be a platform for the spread of lies, falsity, to poison and divide society through such lies, encourage xenophobia, and profit from that,"" added Tong, who is Singapore's senior minister of state for law. 
This month's incident ""reinforces"" the need for legislation, said Tong, who is also on a panel of lawmakers that has recommended the government consider legislation to tackle the spread of online falsehoods or 'fake news'.
Regarding its refusal to take down the post, Facebook earlier said in an emailed statement it did not have a policy ""that prohibits alleged falsehoods, apart from in situations where this content has the potential to contribute to imminent violence or physical harm"". 
Contacted for comment following Tong's remarks, a Facebook spokeswoman referred Reuters to the firm's previous statement.
Also on Tuesday, Singapore police said in a statement they are investigating a local blog, The Online Citizen, in relation to an allegedly defamatory article. 
""The Online Citizen article...made serious allegations that the government's highest officers are corrupt and that the constitution has been tampered with,"" the police said, adding that laptops and handphones were seized in connection with the case.
The Online Citizen's editor Terry Xu could not be immediately reached for comment.
FALSEHOODS
Singapore's Infocomm Media Development Authority this month said Facebook had declined its request to take down a post linking to the 1MDB article by an Australian-based independent blogger. 
""Facebook has declined to take down a post that is clearly false, defamatory and attacks Singapore, using falsehoods,"" the law ministry said in a statement on its website at the time.
Facebook, which has its Asia-Pacific headquarters in Singapore and recently unveiled plans to invest $1 billion in its first Asian data center in the city-state, has previously sparred with the government over fake news. 
In March, Law Minister K Shanmugam questioned during a parliamentary debate whether social media networks were capable of regulating themselves, while senior Facebook executives pushed back at the idea of further laws to battle fake news.

Singapore ranks 151 among 180 countries rated by the World Press Freedom Index of Reporters Without Borders, a non-government group that promotes freedom of information.

Interpol's general assembly is due to elect a new head at a meeting on Wednesday. On Monday, four U.S. senators issued a statement urging U.S. President Donald Trump to oppose the candidacy of Russia's Alexander Prokopchuk.
The senators accuse Russia of abusing Interpol to settle scores and harass dissidents by issuing warrants, known as red notices, for their arrest. The senators said the election of Prokopchuk would allow Moscow to step up such abuse. 
""This is probably a certain kind of interference in the electoral process of an international organization,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call. 
Prokopchuk, a former major general in Russia's Interior Ministry and current vice president of Interpol, is generally considered the leading candidate for the presidency.
Bill Browder, a British fund manager critical of the Kremlin who has been detained repeatedly at Russia's behest before being released again, said it would be ""outrageous"" if Prokopchuk was named to head the global police agency. 
""This particular individual has been responsible for trying to chase me down and have Interpol arrest me seven times,"" he said in comments to BBC radio. 
""All of a sudden, this guy is now put in charge of the institution he's been trying to abuse for the last six years,"" he said.

Saiful Mulook told a news conference in Frankfurt that Bibi was now free but she and her family needed a passport to leave the country.
Bibi, 53, was convicted of blasphemy in 2010 over allegations she made derogatory remarks about Islam after neighbors objected to her drinking water from their glass because she was not Muslim.
The Supreme Court acquitted her last month.
""The whole world is asking why she's not coming,"" Mulook told reporters. ""The answer is first that to leave a country you need a visa or you require a passport of another country.""
""If the German chancellor directs her ambassador to give a passport to her, her husband and her two daughters conferring German nationality, nobody can stop her for one second because she is no longer Pakistani,"" he added.
""So far, no government has come forward in such an open and free manner,"" he said.
It was unclear why citizenship, rather than a visa, was necessary for her to leave Pakistan, though Mulook said pressure from religious extremists was making it harder for Islamabad to arrange her departure.
She and her family are staying at a safe house in Pakistan, despite offers of asylum from countries including Canada.
Mulook said the status of a friend of Bibi's husband, who has a wife and five daughters, whom he would like to join them, was a sticking point. Another wife of Bibi's husband and her three daughters were not seeking to leave Pakistan with Bibi, he added.
German officials have said that they and a number of other countries are in talks with Bibi's family and the Pakistani government to find a way of rehousing her.
Mulook, who has himself sought refuge in the Netherlands after being threatened for taking on Bibi's case, said Bibi had no preference as to which country she would travel to for asylum.

The German government had no immediate comment on the request for a passport.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) on Tuesday urged Turkey to swiftly process the legal case of the ex-head of the pro-Kurdish opposition, saying his pre-trial detention had gone on longer than could be justified.
Selahattin Demirtas, former co-chairman of the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) and one of Turkey's best known politicians, was sentenced in September to more than four years in jail on terrorism charges related to a speech he gave in 2013.
Having already spent nearly two years in prison awaiting trial for those alleged offences, he had effectively already served out the prison term handed down by the Turkish court.
But Demirtas remains in prison facing several more terrorism-related charges, mostly for other speeches he gave, that could see him sentenced to up to 142 years in jail if found guilty.
""The Court found that the judicial authorities had extended Mr Demirtas' detention on grounds that could not be regarded as 'sufficient' to justify its duration,"" the Strasbourg-based ECHR said in a statement. 
The ECHR ruled that Ankara ""was to take all necessary measures to put an end to the applicant's pre-trial detention.""
Turkish Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul dismissed the court's ruling, saying the country's judiciary would decide on Demirtas' cases.
The government accuses the HDP of links to the outlawed Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Turkey, the European Union and the United States. The HDP denies this.
The ECHR also criticized Turkey for keeping Demirtas detained during two elections: a constitutional referendum in 2017 and this year's presidential ballot.
""The extensions of Mr Demirtas' detention, especially during two crucial campaigns... pursued the predominant ulterior purpose of stifling pluralism and limiting freedom of political debate,"" it said.
The court, which awarded Demirtas 10,000 euros ($11,430) in damages and a further 15,000 euros in costs, ruled against a number of his other complaints and accepted that he had been arrested and detained on ""reasonable suspicion"" of having committed a criminal offense.
Kati Piri, EU Rapporteur on Turkey, said the clear ECHR verdict meant Demirtas should be released immediately. ""His detention is of a political, not a criminal nature."" 
Kerem Altiparmak, a prominent Turkish human rights advocate and professor, also called for Demirtas' immediate release, as his pre-trial detention was now in violation of both domestic and international law.
ECHR rulings are in theory binding, but there have been many instances in which Turkey has not implemented them, paying fines instead.

ADEN (Reuters) - Intense fighting broke out in Yemen's port city of Hodeidah late on Monday, shattering a lull in violence that had raised hopes of a ceasefire between a Saudi-led coalition and Houthi insurgents as the United Nations tried to resume peace talks.
Coalition warplanes conducted more than 10 air strikes on Houthi positions and battles could be heard in the ""July 7"" district, four km (2.5 miles) away from the port, residents said. One resident said a medium-range missile had been fired from the city center towards the district in the suburbs.
The coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates had last week ordered a halt in its offensive against the Houthi-held Red Sea port city, now a focus of the war, amid pressure from the West to end a conflict that has pushed Yemen to the brink of famine.
The two countries also pledged on Tuesday a new $500 million food aid program for Yemen, aiming to reach 10 to 12 million people.
The Iranian-aligned Houthi group announced early on Monday it was halting drone and missile attacks on Saudi Arabia, the UAE and their Yemeni allies, in one of its biggest concessions since it quit the southern port city of Aden in 2015.
The Houthi movement also said it was ready for a broader ceasefire if the coalition ""wants peace"".
Later Yemen information minister Moammar al-Eryani said the Houthis had ""fired a missile towards Saudi lands"", adding on his Twitter account the missile failed to reach its target and fell inside Yemen. Houthi authorities could not immediately be reached for comment on the report.
It was not immediately clear whether the renewed fighting in Hodeidah would derail efforts by U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths to salvage peace talks that collapsed in September when the Houthi delegation failed to show up.
""The fighting is escalating and we can clearly hear machine guns and mortar fire. This is one of the worst nights we have experienced,"" said Hodeidah resident Mustafa Abdo.
When asked about the fighting, a pro-coalition Yemeni military source told Reuters late on Monday that a ceasefire in Hodeidah would start only after the U.N. Security Council passes a British-drafted resolution on Yemen.
It is not immediately clear when the text, submitted to the Security Council on Monday, could be put to a vote.
Kuwait's U.N. Ambassador Mansour al-Otaibi told reporters he would propose amendments to the draft resolution as Kuwait was unhappy with ""many things"". He also said some council members didn't think it was the right time for a resolution.
The draft resolution, seen by Reuters, calls for a halt to fighting in Hodeidah, a stop to attacks on populated areas across Yemen and an end to attacks on countries in the region.
It also calls for an unhindered flow of commercial and humanitarian goods across the impoverished country, including a large, fast injection of foreign currency into the economy through the Central Bank of Yemen and more aid funding.
Western allies including the United States have called for a ceasefire ahead of peace efforts to end the nearly four-year-old war that has killed more than 10,000 people and caused the world's most urgent humanitarian crisis.
Western countries have provided arms and intelligence to the Arab states in the alliance, but have shown increasing reservations about the war since the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at Riyadh's consulate in Istanbul last month.
The Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen's war in 2015 to restore the internationally recognized Yemeni government that was ousted from the capital Sanaa by the Houthis in 2014.
The conflict is seen as a proxy war between Riyadh and Iran.
Griffiths said on Friday that Yemen's parties have given ""firm assurances"" they are committed to attending peace talks he hopes to convene in Sweden before the end of the year to agree on a framework for peace under a transitional government.

City mayor Virginia Raggi, who watched the operation carried out against the Casamonica mobsters, said the properties would be demolished by the end of the year.
""Today is an historic day for the city of Rome and for Romans,"" said Raggi, a member of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement who has been criticised for not doing more to clean up the Italian capital.
""We are putting an end to years of illegality and are sending a strong statement to the Casamonica clan,"" he said.
After years of operating in the shadows, the family leapt to public attention with a lavish funeral for one of its godfathers in 2015. A helicopter dropped rose petals on mourners while posters were strung on the railings of a city basilica which read: ""You have conquered Rome, now conquer paradise.""
The Casamonica family has been associated with crime in the south-eastern quarters of Rome for several decades, but the high profile funeral sparked a fierce backlash with politicians demanding a comprehensive legal assault on the clan.
In July, 33 members of the group were arrested in raids on gaudy properties which were filled with gilded mirrors, marbled sculptures of animals and extravagant, regal furniture.
Raggi said some of the villas confiscated on Tuesday had been built in areas of archaeological interest. ""Some houses had even incorporated whole features of the historic Felice Aqueduct,"" she said, referring to a 16th century city waterway.

Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, who heads the far-right League party, has promised to join in when the bulldozers set to work on the villas. ""The party is over,"" he said on Monday as he visited the police operations room.

Mohamed Nasheed, the chief of the Maldivian Democratic Party, which leads the ruling federal alliance, told Reuters this week that it was a mistake to strike such a deal with the world's second biggest economy. 
The Maldives parliament would not pass the law changes required for the zero tariffs agreement to come into force, he said.
His comments followed a warning from the new President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, who took office on Saturday, that the Maldives was in financial difficulty after racking up debt with Chinese lenders. 
In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular news briefing that the trade deal had undergone friendly and equal consultations, and that it is ""mutually beneficial"".
""Its early implementation will lead to early benefits for both sides. We believe the Maldives government will make the correct choice,"" Geng said, without elaborating. 
Best-known for its luxury resorts on palm-fringed coral islands, the Maldives is among a number of small countries where China has invested billions of dollars building highways and housing as part of its Belt and Road Initiative.
The initiative aims to boost China's trade and investment flows with much of Asia and parts of the rest of the world. However, projects are facing opposition in some countries amid concerns about a debt trap that China has rejected. 
Former Maldives President Abdullah Yameen, who lost the election in September, signed the trade deal during a December visit to Beijing. The Maldives parliament ratified the treaty despite opposition protests that he had rushed through the 1,000-page document in less than an hour without any debate.
Nasheed, a former president and now an adviser to Solih, has called the agreement a ""one-way treaty"" that favors China.
Critics in the Maldives say a China-led infrastructure boom has left the country of a little more than 400,000 people debt-ridden, and a free trade pact would only make the situation worse given the lopsided nature of the relationship.
Between January to August this year, the Maldives' imports from China were $342 million, while its exports to China were just $265,270, according to Maldives customs data.

Early this year, the two countries set up a joint panel to work out how to explore offshore oil and gas in areas that both claim, without addressing the explosive issue of who has the sovereign rights to them. 
""Signing the Chinese deal will make the Philippines recognize an unlawful 'co-ownership' with China,"" the minority senators said in a resolution on the eve of Tuesday's visit to Manila by Chinese President Xi Jinping.
The Philippines, which relies heavily on energy imports is racing against time to develop oil and gas reserves in the South China Sea, but to do that needs foreign help, which China has offered.
Though they intend to undertake some projects in waters that are not subject to competing claims, there are concerns among Philippine lawyers and diplomats about teaming up in areas that both countries claim, in particular, the Reed Bank, about 90 miles (167 km) off the Philippines' Palawan island. 
A 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in a case filed by Manila clarified, among other issues, that the Philippines had sovereign rights to exploit energy reserves at the Reed Bank.
It also invalidated China's nine-dash line claim to most of the South China Sea, which the senate resolution said was ""unlawful and expansive"".
China refuses to recognize the Hague tribunal's ruling. 
The idea of joint development was first hatched in 1986, but disputes and the complexities of the sovereignty issue have held up the plans.
The senators said any agreement with China would be a violation of the constitution, and an impeachable offense.
Presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo said any joint agreement would be constitutional, adding that it was too early to discuss senate scrutiny.

""Any demand for a release of documents ... is premature and could be prejudicial to our country's interests, given that parties have yet to ink any agreement,"" Panelo said.

Trump's comments over the last few days have angered Pakistan, including Prime Minister Imran Khan, who on Monday hit back at Trump by saying on Twitter that few allies have sacrificed or helped the United States as much as Pakistan in its war on terror.
The friction threatens to further worsen already fragile relations between Islamabad and Washington, on-off allies who have repeatedly clashed about the war in Afghanistan and Pakistan's alleged support for Islamist militants. 
""The Foreign Secretary called in the U.S. CdA Ambassador Paul Jones to register a strong protest on the unwarranted and unsubstantiated allegations made against Pakistan,"" Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Over the weekend, Trump said in an interview Pakistan doesn't ""do a damn thing"" for the United States despite billions of dollars in U.S. aid, and alleged Pakistani officials knew former al Qaeda leader bin Laden's location before his killing by U.S. troops in a raid inside Pakistan in 2011.
On Monday, Trump tweeted again and doubled down on those claims.
""Rejecting the insinuations about OBL, Foreign Secretary reminded the US CdA that it was Pakistan’s intelligence cooperation that provided the initial evidence to trace the whereabouts of OBL,"" the ministry said, adding that ""baseless rhetoric about Pakistan was totally unacceptable"".

The system's rollout has attracted international headlines, sparking comparisons to George Orwell's novel ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"", with critics saying it could massively heighten the Chinese Communist Party's already strict control over society.
In a roadmap plan released in 2014, China said it would by 2021 create a ""social credit system"" to reward or punish individuals and corporations using technology to record various measures of financial credit, personal behavior and corporate misdeeds.
But it had not made any mention of using points, as proposed by Beijing's municipal government in a new plan released on Monday to improve the city's business environment.
Lists of data, actions and measures will by used to create a trial system of ""personal trustworthiness points"" for residents and companies in the capital. The term used can also be translated as ""creditworthiness"" or ""integrity"". 
The plan did not include details of how the point system would work. 
But, it said, information from the system could impact market access, public services, travel, employment and the ability to start businesses, with trustworthy individuals being provided a ""green channel"" and those who are blacklisted being ""unable to move a step"".
""This is an important novel approach by Beijing to assess individuals' credit and tie it to their whole life,"" an unnamed official from the municipal state planner said, according to the Xinhua news agency. 
The plan should serve as an example to the rest of the nation for how to improve the behavior of individuals and businesses, Xinhua said.
A second system will also be set up to assess the trustworthiness of government officials and departments by measuring whether contracts and promises are honored, the results of which will be included in performance assessments.
The social credit system, which is being built on the principle of ""once untrustworthy, always restricted"", will encourage government bodies to share more information about individual and business misdeeds in order to coordinate punishments and rewards. 
Some experts say that the system remains nascent and could help tackle social problems like fraud or food security, as well as noting that punishments are mostly restricted to industry specific blacklists rather than a holistic score.
A system for penalizing individuals blacklisted for such offences as failing to pay a court-mandated fines that was put in place by the central government was extended in March. The penalties include banning offenders from making luxury purchases, such as tickets for flights or high-speed rail, for up to a year.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Police said on Tuesday they arrested three men who were allegedly preparing to attack a ""mass gathering"" in Melbourne, less than two weeks after a man was killed in Australia's second-largest city in what police said was an act of terrorism.
Australian federal and state police, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, and other agencies that form part of the Joint Counter Terrorism Team carried out the arrests on Tuesday morning.
Police said three men, Hanifi Halis, 21, Samed Erikioglu, 26 and Ertunc Erikioglu, 30, were taken into custody after they allegedly sought to acquire a semi-automatic gun to carry out an attack. 
All three men were charged with planning a terrorist act, police said. They are all Australian citizens and their passports were canceled earlier this year.
""We now have sufficient evidence to act in relation to preventing a terrorist attack,"" Graham Ashton, Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police, told reporters.
Police said the suspects had yet to decide on the site of their planned attack but they believed it was imminent.
""They were certainly looking at a place of mass gathering, where there would be crowds,"" Ashton said. ""They were trying to focus on trying to have a place where they could kill as many people as possible.""
Police said they believed the arrests had nullified any threat from the group.
Police said they are now combing through 17,000 intercepted phone calls and 10,500 messages exchanged between the group as part of evidence collected during their arrests. Police said it will take several months to transcribe the calls and messages.
Australia, a staunch U.S. ally that sent troops to Afghanistan and Iraq, has been on heightened alert since 2014 for attacks by home-grown militants returning from fighting in the Middle East or their supporters.
Australia currently sees the likelihood of a militant attack as ""probable"", the midpoint on a five-level threat ranking system. It has been set at that level since the system was introduced in 2015.
Police said the three men were known to authorities and their passports were canceled because of concerns they would travel to a conflict zone overseas.
The arrests came less than two weeks after a man set fire to a pickup truck laden with gas cylinders in the center of Melbourne and stabbed three people, killing one, before he was shot by police.
As was the case in that attack, police said on Tuesday the three men had been inspired by Islamic State rather than being directed by the militant group.
Police said the three suspects did not have any links to the man responsible for the Nov. 9 attack, although they had escalated their planning in the aftermath of that assault.
""Certainly over the last week they've become energized about doing something more quickly,"" Ashton said.
Police said the suspects had been using encrypted messaging apps to communicate, which an Australian government minister said was further evidence of the need to amend the law.
Australia proposed a law earlier this year that would require companies such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to provide access to private encrypted data linked to suspected illegal activities.

""We have people now who are swapping messages using encrypted messaging apps. The police are blind to those messages,"" Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton told reporters in Sydney.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's axolotl salamander can almost magically heal itself, holding the power to regrow its heart and brain. But there is one feat it may not pull off: survive dire threats to the last wild place it calls home.
Plagued by polluted water, predatory fish and the steady encroachment of one of the world's biggest megacities, the tiny amphibian steeped in mythological lore has all but disappeared from its home in the muddy canals of southern Mexico City. 
Once a mainstay on the banquet tables of Aztec kings, in 1998 there were about 6,000 axolotls per square kilometer in the salamander's main redoubt, the waterways of the city's Xochimilco district, a scientific census showed.
By 2004, the population had dropped to 1,000 per sq/km, and to less than 35 per sq/km a decade later.
By 2020, there may be none, according to one model. 
Undeterred, a group of Mexican biologists have launched a rescue mission.
""Without the axolotl, Mexico would lose part of its culture and identity,"" said Luis Zambrano, an urban biologist at Mexico's National Autonomous University (UNAM), who leads the team behind the plan.
He argues that farmers in Xochimilco known as chinamperos, who grow a wide range of produce along some 180 kilometers of canals, are crucial players in the effort to build new sanctuaries for axolotl (pronounced ah-sho-LO-tul) while promoting traditional chinampa agriculture. 
Chinampas are floating gardens made from dredged-up black mud slathered on reeds and tree branches once used to produce as many as seven harvests a year for staples like corn and chili peppers. 
They flourished for over a thousand years in the lake that once filled the Valley of Mexico, where the Aztec imperial capital and later Mexico City would arise.
Today, around 80 percent of the remaining chinampas have been abandoned as farmers seek better wages elsewhere.
Over the next decade, Zambrano aims to enroll about half of Xochimilco's chinamperos into an axolotl-friendly organic certification scheme that would allow them to charge higher prices for their crops. The university-run certification aims to launch in 2019.
With a modest budget, his team is creating 20 new sanctuaries with cleaner water using filters that also keep out the non-native tilapia and carp stalking the canals.
            
GENETIC ROCK STAR 
Modern research into the axolotl began in 1864, after a shipment of 34 arrived in Paris from Mexico. Thousands more were then bred as scientists across Europe marveled at their strange appearance and ability to breathe with both lungs and gills. 
Researchers later discovered that axolotls can also absorb oxygen through their skin - making them particularly vulnerable to dirty water - and regenerate amputated limbs and damaged body tissue, creating intense interest in their genes.
Earlier this year, a team of scientists in Germany said they had mapped the complete axolotl genome, revealing it to be 10 times longer than the human genome, which gives researchers more scope to pinpoint the mechanisms for regeneration. 
""You can actually take a primordial piece of the tissue that's going to form its eye and transplant it into the space around the gut and the axolotl will regenerate and form a whole eye there,"" said Randal Voss, a University of Kentucky scientist and director of the world's largest axolotl laboratory.
But whether they have a future outside the laboratory will largely depend on whether Xochimilco's booming tilapia and carp populations can be controlled.
The fish were introduced in the 1970s by the government as part of a nutrition program. But their taste for axolotl eggs and juveniles was not considered.
Industrial-scale fishing earlier this year removed tonnes of them from Xochimilco. But the effort has run out of funding.
Claudia Sheinbaum, set to take over as Mexico City's next mayor in December and herself a scientist, said in a recent interview that she wants the capital's water infrastructure overhauled, and the raw sewage that pollutes the Xochimilco canals when heavy rains overwhelm the aging pipes to be contained.
POP CULTURE APPEAL
Its future hanging in the balance, the axolotl has for years played an outsized cultural role in Mexico and beyond.
In Aztec legend, the desperate rebel god Xolotl transformed himself into an axolotl to hide and avoid his own sacrifice at the hands of his fellow gods. He was still discovered, captured and killed.
Axolotls have appeared in Diego Rivera's murals and Pokemon video games. They even helped inspire the look of the main character Toothless in DreamWorks Animation's hit ""How to Train Your Dragon"" movies.
""There's definitely a cuteness that comes through. The way it stands, the way its eyes are, the shape of its mouth,"" said Simon Otto, head of character animation for the films.
The third installment of the series due out in March draws heavily on rare albino axolotls for a new character, he said.
A few pinkish-white amphibians wiggle around in aquariums at Horacio Mena's axolotl laboratory on the UNAM campus. But most are grey or black, better suited to avoid predators.
Some move toward the edge of the glass and even appear to make eye contact with approaching visitors.
Mena explained how the new sanctuaries will be stocked over the coming months to give the species a new foothold. 

""My dream is to see them live freely,"" he said, ""and return to this mythical part of Mexico that is Xochimilco.""

PORT MORESBY (Reuters) - A group of up to 100 Papua New Guinea (PNG) security personnel forced their way into parliament on Tuesday to demand unpaid wages, lawmakers said, just days after world leaders attended a regional summit in the impoverished island nation.
""It was the armed forces, police and correctional workers. They have entered the parliament and just smashed everything up,"" opposition parliamentarian Allan Bird told Reuters by telephone.
""They were yelling: 'corrupt government, bloody government' and so on. They were taking their frustration out on the furniture,"" he said. ""They dispersed eventually but we are hearing more are mobilizing.""
The unrest came days after PNG hosted Asia-Pacific leaders for a regional summit.
The APEC summit, which ended at the weekend, propelled PNG onto the world stage but many residents were angered when the South Pacific country purchased a fleet of luxury cars that now stand unused in a warehouse.

Most Papua New Guineans eke out a subsistence living and luxury cars are very rare on roads that often require four-wheel drive vehicles.

DENVER (Reuters) - A shooting on a downtown Denver street corner on Monday left one person dead and three others hospitalized with bullet wounds as investigators sought at least one suspect who remained at large, according to a police spokesman.
The three surviving victims were initially said to be in critical condition, but police later said in a Twitter message that their injuries were ""believed to be non-life threatening.""
No further official details were immediately available about the incident, which erupted about 4 p.m. in the lower-downtown area of Denver known as LoDo, a district filled with hotels, restaurants and high-rise residential lofts.
The area is fairly close to Coors Field, which is home to Major League Baseball's Colorado Rockies.
An eyewitness quoted by the Denver Post told the newspaper he saw a single gunman open fire with a pistol on a group of people, then get into the driver's seat of his car, slam the door shut and speed away.
The witness told the newspaper that he heard roughly half a dozen gunshots and that one person in the crowd who was fired on returned gunfire at the assailant's car as it sped from the scene. He said the people targeted by the gunman appeared to be transients or homeless, according to the account.
The bloodshed in Denver came a short time after an unrelated shooting at a hospital in Chicago where a gunman killed a doctor, a pharmaceutical assistant and a police officer before the suspect was himself shot to death, according to police. 
Denver police spokesman Doug Schepman told reporters that four people were confirmed shot in the Colorado capital, with one of the victims pronounced dead at the scene, and that no suspects were immediately arrested.
""We don't know right now whether there was one shooter or more than one,"" he said, adding that investigators had yet to determine what may have precipitated the gunfire and whether the assailant or assailants knew any of the victims.
""It's too early to say what happened and why,"" he told reporters. ""To have multiple gunshots fired in an area like this is quite concerning.""
Schepman said witnesses had told police of a possible fifth victim, a woman, who they thought might have been shot in the leg, but he said officers had been unable to locate such a person.
He also acknowledged that there had been a homicide a couple of blocks away on Sunday, but added: ""At this time we do not have information that connects these two incidents.""

CHICAGO (Reuters) - A gunman shot a doctor to death outside a Chicago hospital on Monday before storming the facility and killing a pharmaceutical assistant and a police officer during an exchange of gunfire and dying in the rampage, officials said.
The shooter knew the doctor he shot outside Mercy Hospital, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said at a news conference, describing that initial killing as an act of domestic violence. 
The gunman was the ex-fiance of the doctor, Chicago media outlets reported, with one witness saying he demanded a ring back.
The shooting sent doctors and patients streaming out of the facility, some with their hands up as heavily armed police officers sought to secure the hospital. 
""The city of Chicago lost a doctor, a pharmaceutical assistant and a police officer, all going about their day, all doing what they love,"" Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel told reporters.
""This tears at the soul of our city. It is the face and consequence of evil,"" Emanuel said. 
The gunman, after killing the doctor, fired at arriving police officers with a single handgun, Johnson said.
The gunman, whose name has not been released, then burst into the hospital. Officers followed him inside and exchanged gunfire with him for several minutes, Johnson said.
Officer Samuel Jimenez, who joined the Chicago police force last year, died during the gun fight, officials said. The 28-year-old was married with children and the second Chicago officer killed in the line of duty this year. 
""There’s no doubt in my mind that all of those officers who responded were heroes and they saved a lot of lives, because we just don't know how much damage he (the gunman) was prepared to do,"" Johnson said.
In a sign of the random nature of the rampage, the pharmacy assistant shot by the gunman just happened to be getting off an elevator, Johnson said. Her name has not been released.
Local media identified the doctor killed outside the hospital as Tamara O'Neal.
The gunman also died but it was not immediately clear if he shot himself or was struck by a police officer's bullet, Johnson said.
Another officer was spared injury when a bullet lodged itself in his holster. 
In Denver, another shooting left one person dead and three others wounded on Monday. At least one suspect remained at large after the shooting on a downtown street corner.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is considering adding Venezuela to its list of state sponsors of terrorism but no final decision has been made, a person familiar with the deliberations said on Monday.
Adding Venezuela to the list could limit U.S. economic assistance and impose financial restrictions on a country already suffering from hyperinflation, mass migration and shortages of food and medicine.
Discussions on the issue have moved forward in recent days with strong lobbying from Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who has long pressed the administration to take a tougher stand against the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, the source said.
A time frame for a decision on whether to add Venezuela to the terrorism list had not yet been determined, the source said.
A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it would be a challenge for the Trump administration to provide concrete proof linking the Maduro government to terrorism if it decides to put Venezuela on the list.
The four countries currently on the list - North Korea, Iran, Sudan and Syria - have been found to ""have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.""
Rubio and two other Republican senators sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in September urging him to name Venezuela a state sponsor of terrorism and accusing it of links to Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, but they offered no proof.
The Trump administration has levied several rounds of sanctions against Maduro's Socialist-led government since 2017, accusing it of undermining democracy. On Nov. 1, President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed a disrupting Venezuela's gold exports. 
Venezuela's Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Maduro, who denies limiting political freedoms, has said he is the victim of an ""economic war"" led by the United States.
The Washington Post, which first reported that the Trump administration was considering the designation, said the U.S. State Department had been asking for feedback on the proposed move from various agencies in recent days.
A State Department spokesperson said it ""consistently and on an ongoing basis reviews available information and intelligence, from many sources, on possible state-level involvement in terrorism, evaluating all credible, verified, and corroborated information in its entirety.""
The White House declined to comment.
A senior U.S. official told Reuters earlier this month that the Trump administration was ""looking at all potential avenues"" to pressure Maduro's government.
""We believe his presidency to be illegitimate,"" the official said, reiterating Washington's rejection of the outcome of Venezuela's elections earlier this year. Maduro won a new six-year term in May but his main rivals disavowed the election and alleged massive irregularities.

""The regime really understands that the world is getting smaller for them. And that's the kind of pressure that is needed to really change minds in the regime. The sanctions are having an effect,"" the official said.

Since losing a May election, Najib has been charged with multiple criminal offences and has been subject to corruption investigations, some linked to a multi-billion dollar scandal at state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).
Najib has pleaded not guilty to all charges.
Investigators with the Malaysian Anti Corruption Commission (MACC) are now also looking at whether there had been any kickbacks in the sale of two Scorpene-class submarines to Malaysia by French warship builder DCN International (DCNI) in 2002, when Najib was defense minister, according to local daily The Star citing MACC sources.
One source cited by The Star said Najib was summoned to give a statement on the submarine deal on Monday and that investigators will be taking statements from others, including Najib's former aide, Abdul Razak Baginda, who is being investigated by French financial prosecutors over the deal.
DCNI later became a new entity called DCNS, which in turn rebranded itself as Naval Group last year. French defense company Thales owns around a third of Naval Group.
French authorities began investigating the deal after Malaysian human rights group Suaram alleged the sale resulted in some $130 million of commissions being paid to a company linked to Najib.
Last August, French prosecutors said they had placed two former executives at Thales and DCNS under preliminary investigation as part of a probe into the 2002 submarine sale.
A spokesman from Thales declined to comment at the time.
A spokesman for Naval Group also declined to comment but added: “We scrupulously respect all the relevant national and international legislations”.
Earlier investigations by Malaysian authorities did not find any evidence linking Najib directly to corruption in the deal.
Najib's aides did not respond immediately to requests for comment. Najib and his supporters have consistently denied any wrongdoing in the submarine deal.
The 1MDB scandal was one of the major reasons for Najib's election defeat. The fund is the subject of corruption and money-laundering investigations in at least six countries.
U.S. authorities say $4.5 billion was siphoned from 1MDB and about $700 million was diverted into Najib's personal bank accounts. He has denied any wrongdoing.

923,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 19, 2018 08:10PM ET</span>",Theresa May’s Northern Irish Ally Faces Pressure Over Brexit,"(Bloomberg) -- Theresa May depends on Arlene Foster to help save her Brexit deal. And Foster is facing pressure to cave -- even in her home district.
Foster leads the Democratic Unionist Party, which keeps May in power in London. Five hundred miles away, lies Fermanagh, where she grew up, an area close to the Irish border ravaged by decades of violence during the so-called Troubles.
“It has got to be either May’s deal or no deal,” said Paul Breen, 46, from Brookeborough, a village close to Enniskillen, Foster’s home town. “Arlene being from Fermanagh should be aware of all the great benefits brought by peace and how content everybody seemed pre-2016 to just let things roll on as they were. Why risk that?”
The DUP considers Enniskillen as quintessentially British as London. Its ten lawmakers say May’s accord with the European Union risks setting up barriers within the U.K., imperiling the union. The U.K. government has fired back that the deal is the best available, a version of there-is-no alternative strategy -- shortened as TINA and often used by former British leader Margaret Thatcher.
How Did the Irish Border Become the Biggest Fight of Brexit?
To help avoid the return of checkpoints on the Irish border, May’s deal suggests the entire U.K. will remain in a customs union with the EU until a better solution is found. Moreover, Northern Ireland, which voted to remain in the bloc, will stay in a deeper customs union.
Goods Check
In addition, it will keep many of the EU’s rules even if the rest of the U.K. moves away. That means checks on goods going to Northern Ireland from mainland Britain, the DUP says.
“Without a clean exit clause, the United Kingdom would be handcuffed to the European Union with Brussels holding the keys,” said Foster.
The DUP won’t give in easily. Three quarters of its voters opted to back Brexit in the 2016 referendum, and the rival Ulster Unionist Party backs Foster’s view of May’s deal.
“Having taken the position they have for the last 18 months, I suspect the idea that the DUP will blink at this stage is for the birds, ” said Richard Bullick, a former adviser to Foster. “In the context of the UUP and other unionists politicians’ positions, it’s had to imagine that the views of the business organizations are likely to make a difference. ”
Business Pressure
Business and farmer groups favor the deal, with at least some European officials privately hoping such pressure will push the party to abstain on next month’s parliamentary vote, rather than torpedo it outright and propel the U.K. toward a chaotic exit.
Some officials believe a hard Brexit, which leads to a return of checkpoints on the border, will bolster nationalist sentiment in the region and ultimately make a united Ireland more likely. In Foster’s district, there’s some agreement.
“The DUP need to support this deal; it is an excellent deal for Northern Ireland,” said Dean McKenzie, 29, from Enniskillen. “Northern Ireland within the Union is safe until a majority here say otherwise, but Arlene and the others are making the case for a United Ireland even more attractive.”

News outlets, including Reuters, reported the CIA's finding over the weekend in a case that has sparked an international outcry against the world's top oil exporter. This was the most definitive U.S. assessment to date tying Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler directly to the killing and contradicted Saudi government assertions that he was not involved.
""We in the kingdom know that such allegations about the crown prince have no basis in truth and we categorically reject them, whether through leaks or not,"" Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir was quoted as saying in Saudi-owned Al Sharq Al Awsat newspaper in the first Saudi official comment on the CIA report.
""They are leaks that have not been officially announced, and I have noticed that they are based on an assessment, not conclusive evidence,"" he added.
A source familiar with the CIA's assessment said it was based largely on circumstantial evidence relating to the prince's central role in running the Saudi government.
Jubeir was also asked about comments by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan that the kill order came from the highest level of the Saudi leadership but probably not King Salman, which has put the spotlight instead on the 33-year-old crown prince.
""We have already asked the Turkish authorities at the highest level about the meaning of these comments, and they confirmed to us categorically that the crown prince is not meant by these comments,"" he said.
""The leadership of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, represented by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques (the king) and the crown prince, is a red line, and we will not permit attempts to harm or undermine them,"" he added.
Khashoggi, a Washington Post contributor and one-time royal insider who had been critical of the crown prince recently, was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.
Last week, after offering numerous contradictory explanations for Khashoggi’s disappearance, Riyadh said he had been killed and his body dismembered when “negotiations” to convince him to return to Saudi Arabia failed.

925,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2018 05:33PM ET</span>","Exclusive: After Khashoggi murder, some Saudi royals turn against king’s favorite son","LONDON (Reuters) - Amid international uproar over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, some members of Saudi Arabia's ruling family are agitating to prevent Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman from becoming king, three sources close to the royal court said.
Dozens of princes and cousins from powerful branches of the Al Saud family want to see a change in the line of succession but would not act while King Salman - the crown prince’s 82-year-old father - is still alive, the sources said. They recognize that the king is unlikely to turn against his favorite son, known in the West as MbS.
Rather, they are discussing the possibility with other family members that after the king's death, Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, 76, a younger full brother of King Salman and uncle of the crown prince, could take the throne, according to the sources. 
Prince Ahmed, King Salman’s only surviving full brother, would have the support of family members, the security apparatus and some Western powers, one of the Saudi sources said.
Prince Ahmed returned to Riyadh in October after 2-1/2 months abroad. During the trip, he appeared to criticize the Saudi leadership while responding to protesters outside a London residence chanting for the downfall of the Al Saud dynasty. He was one of only three people on the Allegiance Council, made up of the ruling family's senior members, who opposed MbS becoming crown prince in 2017, two Saudi sources said at the time.
Neither Prince Ahmed nor his representatives could be reached for comment. Officials in Riyadh did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment on succession issues.
The House of Saud is made up of hundreds of princes. Unlike typical European monarchies, there is no automatic succession from father to eldest son. Instead the kingdom’s tribal traditions dictate that the king and senior family members from each branch select the heir they consider fittest to lead.

Senior U.S. officials have indicated to Saudi advisers in recent weeks that they would support Prince Ahmed, who was deputy interior minister for nearly 40 years, as a potential successor, according to Saudi sources with direct knowledge of the consultations.
These Saudi sources said they were confident that Prince Ahmed would not change or reverse any of the social or economic reforms enacted by MbS, would honor existing military procurement contracts and would restore the unity of the family.
One senior U.S. official said the White House is in no hurry to distance itself from the crown prince despite pressure from lawmakers and the CIA’s assessment that MbS ordered Khashoggi’s murder, though that could change once Trump gets a definitive report on the killing from the intelligence community.
The official also said the White House saw it as noteworthy that King Salman seemed to stand by his son in a speech in Riyadh on Monday and made no direct reference to Khashoggi’s killing, except to praise the Saudi public prosecutor.
President Donald Trump on Saturday called the CIA assessment that MbS ordered Khashoggi's killing ""very premature"" but ""possible"", and said he would receive a complete report on the case on Tuesday. A White House official referred Reuters to those comments and had ""nothing else to add at this time"".
The Saudi sources said U.S. officials had cooled on MbS not only because of his suspected role in the murder of Khashoggi. They are also rankled because the crown prince recently urged the Saudi defense ministry to explore alternative weapons supplies from Russia, the sources said.
In a letter dated May 15, seen by Reuters, the crown prince requested that the defense ministry ""focus on purchasing weapon systems and equipment in the most pressing fields"" and get training on them, including the Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile system. 
Neither the Russian defense ministry nor officials in Riyadh immediately responded to Reuters requests for comment.
U.S. ROLE KEY
The brutal killing of Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the crown prince, in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month has drawn global condemnation, including from many politicians and officials in the United States, a key Saudi ally. The CIA believes the crown prince ordered the killing, according to U.S. sources familiar with the assessment. 
Saudi Arabia’s public prosecutor has said the crown prince knew nothing of the killing.
The international uproar has piled pressure on a royal court already divided over 33-year-old Prince Mohammed's rapid rise to power. Since his ascension, the prince has gained popular support with high-profile social and economic reforms including ending a ban on women driving and opening cinemas in the conservative kingdom.
His reforms have been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent, a purge of top royals and businessmen on corruption charges, and a costly war in Yemen.
He has also marginalized senior members of the royal family and consolidated control over Saudi’s security and intelligence agencies.
He first ousted then-powerful crown prince and interior minister Mohammed bin Nayef (MbN), 59, in June 2017. Then he removed Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, 65, son of the late King Abdullah, as head of the National Guard and detained him as part of an anti-corruption campaign.
Some 30 other princes were also arrested, mistreated, humiliated and stripped of their wealth, even as MbS splashed out on palaces, a $500 million yacht, and set a new record in the international art market with the purchase of a painting by Italian Renaissance engineer and painter Leonardo Da Vinci.
The entire House of Saud has emerged weakened as a result.
According to one well-placed Saudi source, many princes from senior circles in the family believe a change in the line of succession ""would not provoke any resistance from the security or intelligence bodies he controls"" because of their loyalty to the wider family.
""They (the security apparatus) will follow any consensus reached by the family.""
Officials in Riyadh did not respond to a request for comment.
The United States, a key ally in economic and security terms, is likely to be a determining factor in how matters unfold in Saudi Arabia, the Saudi sources and diplomats say. 
Trump and his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner have cultivated deep personal relationships with the crown prince. One Saudi insider said MbS feels he still has their support and is willing to ""roll some heads to appease the U.S.""
But Trump and top administration officials have said Saudi officials should be held to account for any involvement in Khashoggi’s death and have imposed sanctions on 17 Saudis for their alleged role – including one of MbS's closest aides.
U.S. lawmakers are meanwhile pushing legislation to punish Riyadh for the killing, and both Republican and Democratic senators have urged Trump to get tough on the crown prince.
King Salman, 82, is aware of the consequences of a major clash with the United States and the possibility that Congress could try to freeze Saudi assets. 
Those who have met the king recently say he appeared to be in denial about the role of MbS in what happened, believing there to be a conspiracy against the kingdom. But they added that he looked burdened and worried.
ALLEGIANCE COUNCIL
When the king dies or is no longer be able to rule, the 34-member Allegiance Council, a body representing each line of the ruling family to lend legitimacy to succession decisions, would not automatically declare MbS the new king.
Even as crown prince, MbS would still need the council to ratify his ascension, one of the three Saudi sources said. While the council accepted King Salman's wish to make MbS crown prince, it would not necessarily accept MbS becoming king when his father dies, especially given that he sought to marginalize council members.
Officials in Riyadh did not respond to a request for comment.
The Saudi sources say MbS has destroyed the institutional pillars of nearly a century of Al Saud rule: the family, the clerics, the tribes and the merchant families. They say this is seen inside the family as destabilizing.
Despite the controversy over Khashoggi's killing, MbS is continuing to pursue his agenda. 
Some insiders believe he built his father a new but remote Red Sea palace in Sharma, at the Neom City development site -- thrown up in a record one year at a cost of $2 billion -- as a gilded cage for his retirement.
The site is isolated, the closest city of Tabouk more than 100 km (60 miles) away. Residence there would keep the king out of the loop on most affairs of state, one of the sources close to the royal family said.

Officials in Riyadh did not respond to a request for comment.

May agreed a draft arrangement to leave the European Union last week, but DUP leader Arlene Foster has said that May should demand a better deal, arguing the current proposal could undermine the integrity of the United Kingdom. 
Under the terms of the DUP's arrangement with May's Conservative party, the Northern Irish party has agreed to back May's government on, among other things, ""the Budget; finance bills; money bills"".
But on Monday, the DUP abstained on the first two votes on the Finance Bill, and eight DUP lawmakers voted against the government in a third vote, on an amendment to the bill proposed by the opposition Labour party. 
While the government still won the votes, commentators said that the move had a deeper significance given the tensions between the DUP and government.
""This is to put the government on warning that the party is close to ripping up the ""confidence and supply"" agreement that allows Theresa May to govern,""  ITV  (LON:ITV) Political Editor Robert Peston said in a tweet.

""We are working very closely with Germany at this moment ... and we will decide ourselves a certain number of sanctions very quickly over what we know (about the murder),"" Le Drian told Europe 1 radio when asked whether Paris would follow Germany in imposing travel bans on Saudi individuals.
""But we believe that we need to go beyond that, because the whole truth needs to be known."" 
Le Drian did not specify when, who or how individuals would be targeted, but insisted that Paris wanted to have all the facts in place before making a decision.
""We want all the truth to be established and today it's not the case. When I say all the truth, I mean the circumstances, those responsible need to be designated and once we've decided ourselves on the subject then we'll take the necessary sanctions.""
French reaction has been relatively guarded given it is keen to retain its influence with Riyadh and protect commercial relations spanning energy, finance and military weapons sales.
Asked about a CIA assessment blaming Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) for the killing and whether he could stay in his position, Le Drian said Paris had no intention of meddling in Saudi affairs.
""He took some very strong initiatives that nobody was expecting ... very significant initiatives and a modernization project that everyone appreciated,"" Le Drian said.

The Catholic Church worldwide is reeling from crises involving sexual abuse of minors, damaging confidence in the Church in Chile, the United States, Australia and Ireland and other countries.
The Polish court of appeal upheld last month a landmark ruling granting a million zloty ($260,000) in compensation to a victim of sexual abuse by a Catholic priest, accepting that the Church was responsible.
""We ask God, the victims of abuse, their families and the Church community for forgiveness for all the harm done to children and young people and their relatives,"" the Polish Bishops wrote in a statement after a conference dedicated to the issue.
They called on victims to report the crimes to Church and state authorities. 
""We note with sadness that in Poland too there are cases of sexual abuse of children and young people by some members of the clergy and those working in the Church. We repeat after Pope Francis: 'The pain of the victims and of their families is also our pain,'"" the bishops said.
Pope Francis will meet bishops from around the world at the Vatican in February to discuss the protection of minors.

The project will cost 85 billion riyals ($22.7 billion) and will create 10,000 jobs, according to Falih. It is part of an industrial scheme aimed at opening up Saudi's north to development that will boost job creation.
Saudi authorities estimate the region holds 500 million tons of phosphate ore, around 7 percent of global proven reserves, mainly in the Al Jalamid and Umm Wu'al areas between Arar and Turaif.

The bans bind all members of the European Union's passport-free Schengen zone, suggesting Germany is willing to use its influence as the EU's largest country to push for a tougher line.
Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said the decision had been closely coordinated with France, which is part of the Schengen zone, and Britain, which is not, and EU states had expressed ""great support"" for the decision when he briefed them in Brussels on Monday.
""We also had a joint statement on the issue this weekend, which indicates we are not satisfied with the results of the investigation thus far ... and that we retain the right to take further steps,"" he said. 
When asked on possible French action, Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said: ""We are working very closely with Germany at this moment ... and we will decide ourselves a certain number of sanctions very quickly over what we know (about the murder).""
Germany had also pressured its arms manufacturers to stop authorized shipments, something a spokesman said meant: ""there are currently no (arms) exports from Germany to Saudi Arabia,""
Germany already suspended issuing future export weapons export licenses to Saudi Arabia last month. 
Any member of the 26-country Schengen area can unilaterally ban anyone it deems a security risk, although it unusual for a country to impose such a large number of bans at once in such a politically sensitive case. 
Those banned are the 15 members of the squad suspected of killing Khashoggi in Riyadh's Istanbul consulate, and a further three suspected of organizing the murder, had been banned, Foreign Ministry spokesman Christofer Burger said, without naming them.
Asked if Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was among them, Burger declined to comment.
Saudi prosecutors said last week that the crown prince, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, knew nothing of the operation, in which Khashoggi's body was dismembered, removed from the building and handed over to an unidentified ""local cooperator"".
An Interior Ministry spokeswoman said the ban would apply even if any of those affected held diplomatic passports.
Defense industry experts said the main impact of Germany halting exports would be on the sale of patrol boats built by privately-held Luerrsen, jeopardizing 300 jobs at a shipyard in the northeastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and four Cobra counter-battery radar systems to be built by a consortium that includes France's Thales, Airbus and  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) of the United States. 
It remained unclear how the freeze would impact multinational programs such as the Eurofighter, built by a consortium of firms in Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain.
However, in response to a parliamentary query, the government said previous accords meant no Eurofighter partner nation could block a sale of jets or parts to other countries.
BAE Systems (LON:BAES), which led the Eurofighter campaign to win a 10-billion-pound ($12.86 billion) contract from Saudi Arabia for 48 new Eurofighter Typhoon jets, declined to comment.

The company is still finalizing the deal after signing a memorandum of understanding with Saudi Arabia in March. About a third of their components would come from Germany.

Putin discussed possible Russian retaliation with top Russian Defence Ministry officials and added that the Kremlin was ready to discuss the INF treaty with Washington. 
The Cold War-era treaty, which rid Europe of land-based nuclear missiles, has come into question against a backdrop of renewed tensions between the West and Russia, most notably over Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea and role in eastern Ukraine.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has accused Russia of non-compliance with the 31-year-old missile accord and warned it will pull out of the deal as a result. The Kremlin denies violating the pact.
NATO and Russian envoy addressed the dispute during rare talks on Oct. 31, with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg urging Moscow to make quick changes to comply in full with the treaty. He said Russia's development of the land-based, intermediate-range SSC-8 cruise missile posed ""a serious risk to strategic stability"".
European leaders worry any collapse of the INF treaty could lead to a new, destabilizing arms race.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Home-renting company Airbnb Inc  said on Monday it would remove listings in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, a move Israel called a ""wretched capitulation"" to boycotters and Palestinians hailed as a step towards peace.
The decision, affecting some 200 listings, would take effect in the coming days, Airbnb said. 
Israel captured the West Bank in a 1967 war. Its settlements there are considered illegal by most world powers.
Palestinians deem the settlements, and the military presence needed to protect them, to be obstacles to their goal of establishing a state. Israel disputes this. 
""We concluded that we should remove listings in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank that are at the core of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians,"" Airbnb said on its website.
""Our hope is that someday sooner rather than later, a framework is put in place where the entire global community is aligned so there will be a resolution to this historic conflict and a clear path forward for everybody to follow."" 
Palestinians and their supporters had long lobbied Airbnb to delist the settlements. Israel strongly opposes such calls for boycotts, which it considers a biased approach to the conflict.
Israeli Tourism Minister Yariv Levin called Airbnb's move ""the most wretched of wretched capitulations to the boycott efforts"". 
Speaking on Israel's Channel 13 television, he said Israel was not told of the decision in advance and that it would respond by backing lawsuits by settlement listers against Airbnb in U.S. courts. 
Waleed Assraf, head of a Palestinian anti-settlement group run by the umbrella Palestine Liberation Organisation, welcomed Airbnb's decision. Should other companies follow suit, he told Reuters, ""this will contribute to achieving peace"".
Oded Revivi, mayor of the West Bank settlement of Efrat and a representative of the umbrella settler council Yesha, said Airbnb's decision was contrary to the company's stated mission of helping ""to bring people together in as many places as possible around the world"".
""When they make such a decision, they get involved with politics, which ... is going to defeat the actual purpose of the enterprise itself,"" Revivi told Reuters
Human Rights Watch said the Airbnb move came on the eve of its publication of a 65-page report it has carried out into tourist rental listings in settlements, including by Airbnb. 
“Airbnb’s decision to end its listings in Israeli settlements is an important recognition that such listings can’t square with its human rights responsibilities,"" the group said on Monday. ""We urge other companies to follow suit.” The group said its report would be released on Tuesday morning.
Some 500,000 Israelis live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, areas that are also home to more than 2.6 million Palestinians. 
Israel considers the West Bank, the biblical cradle of Judaism, as a security bulwark to the east. Palestinians want the West Bank for a future state, along with East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.
U.S.-sponsored peace talks have been stalled since 2014.

San Francisco-basked Airbnb is eyeing an IPO next year after announcing in February it would not make a public debut this year.

Serb nationalist leader Milorad Dodik, an outspoken supporter of Russia, was speaking as he sworn in in the parliament of Bosnia's autonomous Serb Republic, one day before his official inauguration in Sarajevo along with the Croat and Bosniak members of the presidency.
""I call on the European Union to immediately grant to Bosnia candidate status for membership,"" Dodik said, adding that the gesture would show a constructive approach from the EU instead of supporting foreign interventions in the divided country.
Bosnia applied for EU membership in 2016 but the reforms needed to pursue its bid have stalled.
Dodik will be the first of the three presidency members to preside over the body that directs Bosnia's foreign policy, in which they rotate each six months. He said he would insist on the departure of the international peace envoy and foreign judges from Bosnia.
They were installed as the part of the U.S.-brokered Dayton peace accords that ended the 1992-95 war in which more than 100,000 died and about 2 million were forced from their homes. 
Dodik, who was last year blacklisted by the United States over violations of the Dayton accords, said Russia is ""our natural and powerful ally"", and that he will work to resume cooperation with Russia, China and the United States, ""on the basis of mutual respect"".
He also said Bosnia should be demilitarized and its military budget drastically cut, echoing his repeated opposition to integrating Bosnia into NATO. 
""Bosnia will be militarily neutral because any alignment with any military alliance does not have support of Serbs,"" he said.

Dodik's remarks imply it will be difficult to balance his policies with those of the Bosniak and Croat presidency members, Sefik Dzaferovic and Zeljko Komsic, who both favor NATO integration and cooperation with international representatives.

Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, announcing the plan on Monday, said increasing the number of foreigners studying in the country would help build French influence overseas.
Home to centuries-old universities such as the Sorbonne in Paris and some leading business schools, France is the world's top non-English speaking student destination, but it ranks behind the United States, Britain and Australia.
The number of foreign students at French universities fell by 8.5 percent between 2011 and 2016 and the country has seen increased competition from Germany, Russia, Canada and China, the prime minister's office said.
""Many countries are already building global attractivity strategies, linking studies, the job market, tourism, which explains the influence of Asia or monarchies in the Gulf,"" Philippe said in a speech unveiling the strategy. ""In this field just as in other economic ones, the world's balance of power is shifting. That's why we need to welcome more foreign students.""
Under the plan, France will simplify student visa regulations but will also increase tuition fees for students outside the European Economic Area in order to be able to provide better facilities. However, fees will still be much lower than in Britain and other neighboring countries.
From March 2019, foreign graduates with a French master's degree will be able to get a residence visa to look for work or set up a business in France.
""We are constantly compared, audited, judged among 10 other possible destinations. In an age of social media, no one can rest on its reputation only,"" Philippe said.
French officials said current fees of around 170 euros ($195) a year for a bachelor's degree in France or 243 euros for a masters' - the same as those paid by French students - was interpreted by students in countries like China as a sign of low quality.
From September 2019, non-European students will be charged 2,770 euros annually to study for a bachelor's degree and 3,770 euros a year for masters and PhDs. 
""That means France will still subsidize two thirds of the cost of their studies,"" Philippe said. ""And the fees will remain well below the 8,000 euros to 13,000 euros charged by the Dutch or the tens of thousands of pounds paid in Britain,"" he said.
Some of the extra revenue will be used to boost the number of scholarships offered by the foreign ministry. 
The number of courses taught in English, which have already been increased fivefold since 2004 to 1,328, will be boosted further, Philippe said. 
More French classes will also be on offer for foreign students and student visa applications will be made available online.

In a statement, Syria's army high command said it had taken full control of the Tulul al-Safa heights, a volcanic plateau east of Sweida province.
The area was Islamic State's last stronghold in southern Syria and the Syrian armed forces recovered a large amount of light and medium weaponry, the statement said. 
Local sources told Reuters on Sunday hundreds of Islamic State insurgents had withdrawn from that area after holding out for over three months against an offensive.

State broadcaster NOS cited author Frank Westerman, who helped locate the painting in Romania's Tulcea county after an anonymous tip, turning it over to Romanian police on Saturday.
Westerman told NOS on Sunday he had received an e-mail from a Belgian theatre company which is staging a play about a famed art forger. He said the painting he recovered appears to have been a forgery hidden as part of an elaborate hoax.
Separately a former curator of the museum that owned the real ""Tête d’Arlequin"", or Harlequin's Head, told Dutch television that based on photos he had seen of the painting that was found, it appeared to be a forgery.
Romanian prosecutors, who said Sunday they were trying to verify the work's authenticity, could not immediately be reached for comment. 
The BERLIN theatre company in Antwerp, Belgium, which is putting on the play about forgery, said in a carefully worded tweet that it had ""brought back"" Tête d'Arlequin in a new frame.
On its website it said it would ""be back with more details on this issue within the next few days"" and listed links to reports of the discovery of the painting. 
The real Picasso was stolen from an exhibition in Rotterdam in one of the art world's most dramatic heists. The other paintings taken were Matisse's ""La Liseuse en Blanc et Jaune"", Monet's ""Waterloo Bridge, London"" and ""Charing Cross Bridge, London"", Gauguin's ""Femme devant une fenêtre ouverte"", Meijer De Haan's ""Autoportrait"" and Lucian Freud's ""Woman with Eyes Closed"".

Members of the CSM judicial watchdog's prosecutors' section voted 5-1 to reject an application by Justice Minister Tudorel Toader to dismiss Lazar, the body said on its website. 
CSM did not immediately give reasons for its opinion but while influential, it is only advisory and the final decision rests with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis.
Toader demanded Lazar's dismissal last month, accusing him of exceeding his authority in a move seen as heightening concerns in Brussels about democratic values in some of the European Union's eastern member states.
The anti-corruption drive won the European Commission's praise for exposing high-level crime in one of the bloc's most graft-prone members.
However, another prominent member, chief anti-corruption prosecutor Laura Codruta Kovesi, was sacked in August in a similar procedure. In its annual monitoring report on Romania last week, the Commision asked the Social Democrat government to freeze all attempts to sack or replace chief prosecutors.
Lazar, who has condemned the Social Democrats' attempt to oust him, oversees thousands of prosecutors, including the anti-organized crime unit DIICOT and anti-corruption unit DNA.
Prosecutors have investigated lawmakers, ministers, mayors, magistrates and businessmen in recent years, exposing conflicts of interest, abuse of power, fraud and the award of state contracts in exchange for bribes.
Iohannis, a centrist, has said he supports Lazar but the president is able to assess only the legality of the procedure when making a ruling in the case.
Transparency International ranks Romania as one of the EU's most corrupt states and Brussels has kept its justice system under special monitoring since it joined the bloc in 2007.

The Iranian-aligned group, which has been battling the Saudi-backed government for nearly four years, also said it was ready for a broader ceasefire if the Saudi-led coalition ""wants peace"". 
The Houthis' decision to halt missile attacks could be a turning point in peace efforts as it ends a direct threat to Saudi Arabia. It is by far the biggest concession from the movement since it left the southern port city of Aden in 2015. 
International pressure has mounted on Yemen's warring parties to end the war that has killed more than 10,000 people and pushed the country to the verge of starvation.
The move from the Houthi group came after the coalition ordered a halt in its offensive against Yemen's main port city Hodeidah, which has become the focus of the war.
""We announce our initiative...to halt missile and drone strikes on the countries of aggression,"" Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, the head of the Houthis' Supreme Revolutionary Committee, said in a statement.
The decision was based on discussions with U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths to show ""good faith"" and support peace efforts, he said.
Griffiths welcomed the Houthi announcement and called on all parties continue to show restraint ""to create a conducive environment for convening the consultations"".
The envoy is trying to salvage peace talks after a round in September collapsed when the Houthis did not show up. He hopes to convene talks in Sweden before year end to agree on a framework for peace under a transitional government.
Yemen's parties have given ""firm assurances"" they are committed to attending peace talks, Griffiths told the U.N. Security Council on Friday.
On Monday, the Security Council began considering a British-drafted resolution that aims to improve the humanitarian situation. It calls for a halt to fighting in Hodeidah, a stop to attacks on populated areas across Yemen and an end to attacks on regional countries. 
The draft, seen by Reuters, also calls for an unhindered flow of commercial and humanitarian goods across the country, including lifting of any bureaucratic impediments within two weeks, a large, fast injection of foreign currency into the economy through the Central Bank of Yemen and more aid funding. 
It was not immediately clear when the text could be put to a vote. To pass, a resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, Russia, China, Britain or France. 
TIRED OF WAR
Saudi Arabia's King Salman on Monday reiterated the kingdom's support for U.N. efforts to end the war. The Riyadh-backed government also announced its willingness to take part in the next round of consultations.
Yemenis cautiously welcomed the announcement on Monday.
""We pray that this will be the real beginning of peace in Yemen, we are all tired of this war,"" said Mona Ibrahim, a teacher in the capital Sanaa, which has been under Houthi control since September 2014.
""We just want to live like other humans,"" Mohammed al-Ahdal, a resident of Hodeidah said.
The Houthi defense ministry said it would respond to any hostilities from the coalition.
Graham Griffiths, a senior analyst at Control Risks Middle East, said the announcement was potentially important as it comes in response to the coalition's pausing of operations around Hodeidah. 
""Efforts to resume the peace process remain fragile ... given the mutual distrust between the warring parties. Nevertheless, given the renewed pressure from the international community, there is a real chance to begin to move the conflict toward a durable de-escalation,"" he said. 
Houthi-run Al Masirah TV reported on Monday that Houthi forces fired a ballistic missile on Saudi-backed forces in the desert of Midi, bordering Saudi Arabia.
The Houthis say their missile attacks on Saudi Arabia are in retaliation for air raids on Yemen by the Western-backed coalition, which entered Yemen's war in 2015 to try to restore the Saudi-backed government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.
The coalition has carried out thousands of air strikes in the impoverished country that have hit schools, markets and hospitals, killing hundreds of people - though it says it does not target civilians.
Western allies including the United States have called for a ceasefire ahead of the renewed U.N. efforts.

Western countries have provided arms and intelligence to the Arab states in the alliance, but have shown increasing reservations about the conflict since the murder of U.S.-based Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month.

940,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>",EU backs Iran sanctions over foiled France attack plot: diplomats,"By Robin Emmott
newBRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union foreign ministers on Monday endorsed a French government decision to sanction Iranian nationals accused of a bomb plot in France, a move that could enable EU-wide enforcement of the measures, diplomats said.
The ministers said technical work could now start on a freeze on the EU assets of two Iranians and Iran's intelligence service over a failed plot to carry out a bomb attack at a rally near Paris organized by an exiled Iranian opposition group.
Denmark, which in October said it suspected an Iranian government intelligence service had tried to carry out an assassination plot on its soil, also lobbied for support for similar EU-wide sanctions once its investigation is complete, the diplomats told Reuters.
Though largely symbolic in impact, the EU's readiness to target Iranians marks a shift after months of division within the bloc over how to punish Iranians accused of destabilizing activities in Europe and the Middle East.
In October, France said there was no doubt that Iran's intelligence ministry was behind the June plot to attack the demonstration by Iranian exiles near Paris.
It froze assets belonging to Tehran's intelligence services and two Iranian nationals - a Vienna-based diplomat now under arrest in Belgium for the plot and the deputy minister and director general of intelligence, Saeid Hashemi Moghadam.
Neither appear to have had any assets in France. Paris also discreetly expelled an Iranian diplomat, diplomatic sources told Reuters last month. 
Eager to save a 2015 nuclear accord with Iran from which the United States has withdrawn, the EU has focused its efforts in trying to keep trade flowing with Iran in the face of renewed U.S. sanctions, in order to keep Tehran from pulling out. 
Under the 2015 deal, Iran restricted its disputed nuclear program, widely seen in the West as a disguised effort to develop the means to make atomic bombs, in exchange for an end to international sanctions against it. 
MISSILE SANCTIONS DIDN'T FLY
In March, Britain, France and Germany proposed to sanction Iran over its development of ballistic missiles and its role in Syria's war, but the initiative failed to gather sufficient support across the EU to take effect. 
Italy was one EU country unwilling to countenance new measures as it sought to preserve business ties with Iran?.
In an effort to balance Iran policy, the ministers at their meeting on Monday also tried to press ahead in setting up a special mechanism to trade with Iran that could be under EU, not national, law. 
The Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) is a kind of clearing house that could be used to help match Iranian oil and gas exports against purchases of EU goods in an effective barter arrangement circumventing U.S. sanctions, which are based on global use of the dollar for oil sales.
Despite technical difficulties and delays, the EU believes this formula could shield individual member states from being hit by U.S. sanctions that have been reimposed on trade with Iran after Washington's pullout from the nuclear deal.
""There is a willingness for the financial vehicle ... to be set up quickly,"" French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told reporters.
However, no country has come forward as a potential host. Their reluctance arises from fears that SPV reliance on local banks to smooth trade with Iran may incur U.S. penalties, severing the lenders' access to U.S. markets, diplomats said.
Luxembourg is seen as a good candidate to manage the Iran SPV given its experience setting up a similar mechanism during the 2009-12 euro zone financial crisis.
Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn told Reuters that the country had not been formally asked and he declined to say if it was willing to play host, insisting that firstly, setting it up under EU law could prove a critical step. 
""It's a European commitment, not a national commitment. It must therefore be given a basis in European law,"" he said.
The SPV is seen as the lynchpin of European efforts to salvage the nuclear accord. U.S. President Donald Trump - who took office after the pact was clinched - repudiated it in May, calling it flawed to Iran's advantage.

DAKAR (Reuters) - An informant for Congo's intelligence service and an army colonel on Monday denied involvement in the killing of two U.N. sanctions monitors last year, the prosecutor in the case said.
Zaida Catalan, a Swede, and Michael Sharp, an American, were killed in March 2017 while investigating an armed conflict in Democratic Republic of Congo's Kasai region between government forces and the Kamuina Nsapu militia. 
Reuters and Radio France Internationale (RFI) revealed in December that Jose Tshibuabua, who helped Catalan and Sharp plan their fatal trip the day before they left, was working at the time as an informant for Congo's intelligence agency (ANR).
The report revived questions about what role state agents may have played in the killing of the monitors, who had been investigating a conflict in which Congolese forces have been implicated in atrocities by the United Nations and human rights groups.
Congo's government has blamed the militia from the start and has arrested two dozen individuals. But it said last December it could not exclude the possibility that state agents were involved.
On Monday, Tshibuabua, who was arrested late last year, and Colonel Jean de Dieu Mambweni, who has not been arrested, appeared before the court that is trying the case. 
Tshibuabua told the court in the Kasai city of Kananga that he only learned on the radio three days after the March 12 killings that Sharp and Catalan had gone missing, prosecutor Timothee Mukuntu told Reuters. 
Tshibuabua, a cousin named Betu Tshintela, who served as Sharp and Catalan's translator for their trip, and others linked to Kamuina Nsapu's ruling family met the experts on March 11 in Kananga to help them organize their mission to the village of Bunkonde the next day. 
The bodies of Sharp and Catalan were discovered in a shallow grave two weeks later. Tshintela and three moto taxi drivers who accompanied them on the mission went missing and have not been found.
Security sources have told Reuters and RFI that Colonel Mambweni put Sharp and Catalan in contact with Tshintela. But before the court on Monday, he denied having done so, Mukuntu said. 
Phone logs from the prosecutor's file seen by Reuters and RFI also show that both Tshibuabua and Mambweni exchanged text messages in the days leading up to the killing with the provincial ANR chief, Luc Albert Tanga Sakrine.
Tanga Sakrine has declined to comment on the case. Mukuntu said he did not ask about contacts with Tanga Sakrine but that the issue could come up at a future hearing.

While visiting California's wildfire zones on Saturday, Trump told reporters that Finland spends ""a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things"" to clear forest floors, citing his discussions with Finnish President Sauli Niinisto.
Niinisto told Finnish newspaper Ilta-Sanomat that he had spoken with Trump about Finland's wildfire monitoring system. He recalled telling Trump that Finland takes care of its forests, but added that raking didn't come up. 
Hundreds of Finns posted under the Twitter hashtag #rakefinlandgreatagain, many posting pictures of themselves in the forest or their gardens with rakes. 
""Anybody needs their floors raked?"" tweeted NBA team Chicago Bulls' Finnish star Lauri Markkanen with a picture of him holding a rake.
A #RakeAmericaGreatAgain hashtag also sprang up on the social media site. 
The remains of 77 people have been recovered after California's deadliest wildfire, with almost 1,000 people listed as missing. 
Trump took to Twitter just over a week ago to blame a recent spate of fires on forest mismanagement. 

Three quarters of Finland's territory is covered by forests and the forestry industry accounted for 20 percent of all exports in 2017.

The volcano spewed out dangerous flows of fast-moving clouds of hot ash, lava and gas early Monday and more than 2,000 people had taken refuge in shelters so far, officials from the agency told reporters. There were no immediate reports of injuries.
More dangerous flows of hot ash and lava could be expelled, said Juan Pablo Oliva, the head of the country's seismological, volcanic and meteorological institute Insivumeh.
In June, explosive flows from Fuego killed more than 190 people.

This is the fifth eruption so far this year of the 3,763-meter (12,346-feet) volcano, one of the most active in Central America, about 19 miles (30 km) south of Guatemala City.

Ramaphosa, who has staked his reputation on rooting out corruption, told lawmakers this month that the 500,000 rand payment by facilities management firm African Global Operations was for consulting work done by his son.
On Friday, Ramaphosa said he had inadvertently misled parliament and that the money was used to support his candidacy in the ANC leadership race which he narrowly won last December.
The disclosure is uncomfortable for Ramaphosa as he is trying to restore public confidence in the ANC ahead of a national election next year.
Ramaphosa's close ally, Nhlanhla Nene, resigned as finance minister in October after admitting to lying over the number of times he had met the Gupta family, friends of former president Jacob Zuma who have been implicated in a far-reaching influence-peddling scandal but who deny wrongdoing.
Democratic Alliance party leader Mmusi Maimane said there should not be ""double standards"" over the payment to Ramaphosa's campaign fund. He wants Ramaphosa to appoint an inquiry headed by a retired judge selected by the country's chief justice.
""Ramaphosa has appointed independent inquiries to investigate corruption elsewhere. Now the same standard must apply to him and his family,"" Maimane said in a statement.
Seeking to defuse the controversy surrounding the donation, Ramaphosa's campaign team said over the weekend that it would return the money and that it would audit other donations to ensure that they were ""above board"".
Ramaphosa's spokeswoman Khusela Diko was not available to comment on whether the president would appoint the inquiry called for by Maimane.
Spokesmen for African Global Operations and the ANC did not answer their phones.

Canada said in April it would remove the families of staff posted to Havana, where both Canadian and U.S. diplomats have complained of dizziness, headaches and nausea.
The diplomats complained the foreign ministry - unlike the U.S. State Department - had said very little about the matter in public and did not appear to be making their case a priority. Getting specialized medical care had been difficult, they added.
""We did not expect to be abandoned, or more precisely, sacrificed -- that's how we're feeling now,"" the paper quoted one of them as saying.
Several of those affected believe Ottawa has said little in public because it wants to maintain friendly relations with Cuba, the Globe added.
The office of Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland was not immediately available for comment. The Globe cited Freeland spokesman Adam Austen as saying ""we will continue to do all we can to provide advice and support"" to those affected.
U.S. and Cuban officials met at the State Department in September to discuss the mysterious health problems. The United States has reduced embassy staffing in Cuba from more than 50 to a maximum 18.

Arriving for Brexit talks with EU ministers, Borrell said Madrid wanted the deal on Britain's exit to make clear that talks on ties between London and the bloc will not apply to Gibraltar.
""The negotiations between Britain and the EU have a territorial scope that does not include Gibraltar, the negotiations on the future of Gibraltar are separate discussions,"" Borrell said. 
""This is what needs to made clear, and until it is clarified in the withdrawal agreement and in the political declaration on the future relationship, we cannot give our backing (to the deal)."" 
A small peninsula on Spain's southern coast and a British territory since 1713, Gibraltar is a major point of contention in Anglo-Spanish relations. Spain has long claimed sovereignty over the territory.
Gibraltar is due to leave the European Union along with the United Kingdom in March, although 96 percent of its population voted in the 2016 referendum to remain in the bloc.
Spain said last week that it welcomed the inclusion of a protocol on Gibraltar in the draft Brexit agreement and that it would be positive for residents there. 
An EU diplomat said the issue could go as far as the Sunday summit of all EU leaders aimed at rubber-stamping the Brexit deal, where other outstanding points are fishing and a limit on any extension of a post-Brexit transition phase.

Noting how Spain was obliged to accept British positions on Gibraltar when it was negotiating its 1986 accession to the bloc, a decade after Britain had joined, a senior EU official said London now had to accept that ""the tables have turned"".

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's King Salman urged the international community on Monday to halt Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, and reiterated the kingdom's support for U.N. efforts to end the war in Yemen.
The king's annual remarks to the Shura Council, a top governmental advisory body, were his first public comments since the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the country's consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, which sparked a global outcry.
King Salman, who did not mention the Khashoggi affair, condemned the actions of Iran, its arch-rival for influence in the region, including in the conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. 
""The Iranian regime has always intervened in the internal affairs of other countries, sponsored terrorism, created chaos and devastation in many countries in the region,"" the 82-year-old monarch said.
""The international community has to work to put an end to the Iranian nuclear program and stop its activities that threaten security and stability.""
The king said Riyadh supported U.N. efforts to end the conflict in Yemen, where a Saudi-backed coalition has been battling Iran-aligned Houthi rebels for nearly four years to restore the internationally-recognized government.
""Our standing by Yemen was not an option but a duty to support the Yemeni people in confronting the aggression of Iranian-backed militias,"" he said.
The Houthis said on Monday they were halting drone and missile attacks on Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and their Yemeni allies, and indicated readiness for a broader ceasefire if the Saudi-led coalition ""wants peace"".
UNDER PRESSURE
Riyadh has come under growing international criticism for its conduct of the Yemen war, which has brought the country to the brink of famine and killed many civilians in air strikes.
The reputation of Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, has been further battered by the Khashoggi murder.
The king had largely stepped back from active political life and handed extensive authority to his son and heir apparent, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, but is now trying to defuse the crisis sparked by the murder and shore up the crown prince.
In his speech, King Salman said Saudi Arabia would continue working with OPEC and non-OPEC members to maintain stability in global energy markets.
He also reaffirmed Saudi support for a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, a long-standing position thrown into question last year when the crown prince appeared to back a nascent U.S. peace plan that aligns with that of Israel on key issues.
Last week, after offering numerous contradictory explanations for Khashoggi's disappearance, Riyadh said he had been killed and his body dismembered when ""negotiations"" to convince him to return to Saudi Arabia failed. The public prosecutor said it would seek the death penalty for five suspects in the case.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said the order for the killing of Khashoggi came from the highest level of the Saudi leadership but probably not from King Salman, putting the spotlight instead on the 33-year-old crown prince.
U.S. President Donald Trump has suggested ultimate responsibility lies with the prince as de facto ruler. His administration has imposed economic and travel restrictions on a handful of individuals for alleged involvement, including a top aide to Prince Mohammed..
On Monday the king signaled that the crown prince remains empowered to pursue ambitious economic reforms, praising a ""comprehensive developmental transformation"" underway. He directed his son, sitting in the hall,""to focus on... preparing the new generation for future jobs"".
King Salman also praised the Saudi judiciary and prosecution service for ""performing the duties they were entrusted with"", without elaborating.

In addition to the Khashoggi case, the public prosecutor has participated in an anti-corruption campaign ordered by Prince Mohammed last year in which scores of princes, ministers and businessmen were arrested and the state said it recovered $100 billion in stolen assets.

Browder, the British head of investment fund Hermitage Capital Management, has led a campaign to expose corruption and punish Russian officials he blames for the 2009 death of Sergei Magnitsky, whom he had employed as a lawyer, in a Moscow jail. 
The prosecutors said they had opened a new criminal investigation into Browder and vowed to seek his arrest for creating an international criminal group.
They accused U.S.-born Browder, 54, of setting up companies to launder millions of dollars and said they suspected he may have poisoned four former colleagues, including Magnitsky. 
Nikolai Atmonyev, an aide to Russia's prosecutor-general, said it was ""highly likely"" that Browder himself had ordered the poisoning of Magnitsky in jail, citing testimony from a former cellmate, RIA news agency reported.
Magnitsky was arrested in 2008 shortly after alleging that Russian officials were involved in large-scale tax fraud. He complained of mistreatment by the authorities before his death.
The accusations - which relate to crimes dating from more than nine years ago in at least one case - are the latest in a series to be directed at Browder. He has cast them as a vendetta waged by President Vladimir Putin for his lobbying, which in 2012 led to U.S. sanctions on Russia in the 'Magnitsky Act'.
""I really struck a nerve with the Magnitsky Act,"" Browder wrote on social media on Monday, describing the latest allegations against him as ""Kafka-esque"".
""FEVER DREAM""
Browder drew a parallel between the accusations against him and the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in England in March. The West blamed Russia for the poisoning, which caused a flurry of tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions.
""Putin's 'fever dream' response to being caught poisoning the Skripals is accusing me of four murders, including poisoning of Sergei Magnitsky,"" Browder wrote on Twitter. 
Last year a Russian court sentenced Browder in absentia to nine years in jail after finding him guilty of deliberate bankruptcy and tax evasion.
The U.S. sanctions imposed under the Magnitsky Act imposed visa bans and asset freezes on Russian officials linked to the death of Magnitsky.

Putin has dismissed allegations of foul play against Magnitsky and said he died of heart failure.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - British plans for a swift inclusion in the European Union's new flagship defense pact are being undermined by political turmoil in London and uncertainly over the terms of Britain's exit from the bloc, EU diplomats say.
Prime Minister Theresa May called in February for a new security treaty with the EU from next year and the EU's chief executive argued it was too important to risk getting subsumed in broader Brexit negotiations.
Five diplomats involved in security talks said the issues had now become interlinked, however, because of the level of scepticism voiced by many British politicians towards the draft EU withdrawal deal.
""It's too sensitive to talk about security now when everything is up in the air in London. The issue of Britain's involvement post-Brexit was already divisive for some EU countries,"" said a senior EU official.
Britain, which is seeking a ""deep and special partnership"" with the EU in defense and security, initially hoped to agree in November a deal to take part in the EU's defense pact and access financing from a planned 13 billion euro ($15 billion) EU weapons, technology and research fund.
That decision on Britain's future participation as a third country has now been pushed to December at the earliest but is more likely next year, diplomats said.
Britain, along with France, is one of Europe's biggest military powers and had hoped that security would be one of its biggest bargaining chips as it seeks a new relationship with the EU.
EU defense integration is gathering pace in the wake of Islamic attacks in Western Europe, alleged Russian meddling in European elections and concern about U.S. commitment to NATO under President Donald Trump.
LUCRATIVE
Britain's closest EU allies, led by the Netherlands and the Baltics, are pressing for a deal to allow British industry into lucrative EU military projects and tap into EU funds.
But others, including France and Italy, want non-EU countries' involvement to be on a highly selective basis. Cyprus is also concerned about any potential Turkish involvement if the EU's pact ""Permanent Structure Cooperation"", or PESCO, agreed in December 2017, is open to non-EU countries.
Paris and Rome want to see Britain committing to the EU's foreign and security policy in a political declaration on their future ties that forms a package with the EU withdrawal treaty, according to an internal EU note seen by Reuters.
Pro-Brexit lawmakers in Britain fear London will be bound to the EU in perpetuity under the divorce terms and are skeptical about committing to the bloc's security. Particularly in defense, Britain long blocked EU cooperation and argued military matters should remain a matter for national governments. 
Disagreements over Britain's future place in EU security arrangements are ""not something that would break the deal but it shows how tricky it all is. We'll make sure the UK won't get decision-making powers in our processes,"" one EU diplomat said. 
Britain also wants a role in the European Defense Agency, which helps EU governments to develop weapons and coordinates defense planning. It is giving up its role as host of one of the European Union's five military ""operational headquarters"" because of its departure from the EU.

The 25 countries in the new EU defense pact unveiled a new series of projects on Monday that governments will develop together, including plans for an European armored infantry fighting vehicle, upgrades of attack helicopters and a joint EU intelligence school to train spies.

DUBAI (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates is fully complying with sanctions imposed this month by the United States on Iran even though it will mean a further drop in trade with Tehran, a UAE economy ministry official told Reuters on Monday.
Abu Dhabi, the political capital of the UAE federation, has taken a hawkish stand on Tehran, although Dubai, the country's business hub, has traditionally been a major trading partner with Iran.
Washington announced on Nov. 5 a series of sanctions targeting Iran's banks, shipping sector, national airline and 200 individuals after President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of an international nuclear deal with Tehran. 
""We are implementing the sanctions,"" Abdullah al-Saleh, undersecretary for foreign trade and industry, said in an interview in Dubai. 
The UAE is enforcing the U.S. sanction regime ""as it is published by the United States"", al-Saleh said, adding that the relevant authorities would ensure compliance.
Al-Saleh said the UAE's trade with Iran is expected to decline this year and next year due to the sanctions, after falling to $17 billion in 2017 from a peak of $20 billion in 2013.
Most trade consists of re-exports via Dubai to Iran, which lies across the Gulf.
The sanctions are part of a wider effort by the Trump administration to diminish Iranian influence in the Middle East.
The UAE is among U.S. allies in the Gulf region that staunchly oppose Iranian foreign policy and swiftly backed Washington's decision. It is also a member of a Saudi-led coalition that is opposing the Iran-aligned Houthi group in Yemen's civil war. 
Compliance will mean UAE companies do not face difficulties in the United States, and the UAE government will look to boost trade with other markets such as Africa and Asia to offset the impact of the sanctions on its own economy, al-Saleh said, repeating an existing government policy to diversify trade.
Trump's administration has threatened those who continue to do Iran business with the prospect of losing access to the U.S. market, although it has given temporary exemptions to eight importing countries to keep buying Iranian oil. 
The European Union, France, Germany and Britain, which are trying to save the nuclear deal, have said they regret the U.S. decision and will seek to protect European companies doing legitimate business with Tehran.

Lawmakers opposed to Rajapaksa said they intend to remove funding for staff salaries and other costs in a vote on Nov. 29. The opposition, which regards his administration as illegitimate, will also seek approval to slash the government's overall budget, they said.
It was the latest of several new twists on Monday in the political chaos that has embroiled Sri Lanka for the past few weeks. 
Leaders of political parties backing Rajapaksa and President Maithripala Sirisena refused to allow a third motion of no confidence to be held through name call or electronic voting on Monday. The previous two motions passed through a voice vote but Sirisena said they hadn't followed the proper procedures.
Sirisena appointed Rajapaksa last month after firing Ranil Wickremesinghe as prime minister, setting off the political turmoil on the island off India's southeast coast.
Rajapaksa is seen as a close ally of China, though Beijing has denied accusations that it was instrumental in getting him appointed.
Dinesh Gunawardene, a Rajapaksa loyalist, said Wickremesinghe's coalition had handed a motion ""to suspend all government expenses"" to the speaker and the parliament secretary. 
""According to the previous no confidence motions, both Rajapaksa and his government are out. There is no government, but there are MPs,"" M.A. Sumanthiran, a lawmaker who had voted for the no confidence motion, told Reuters.
""The finance of the country is under the control of the parliament. Now we have proposed a motion to stop government finances for the prime minister's office,"" he said.
Ananda Kumarasiri, the deputy speaker of the parliament, established a select committee to carry on parliamentary business before adjourning the house to Nov. 23. 
Unlike last Thursday and Friday there were no physical altercations on the floor of parliament on Monday. On Friday, lawmakers supporting Rajapaksa threw books, chili paste and water bottles at the speaker to try to disrupt the second vote.
Speaker of Parliament Karu Jayasuriya said in a statement that investigations have begun into Friday's events, including damage that was done to public property in the melee.
The political crisis has hit the economy. On Monday, the rupee fell to a record low of 177.20 per dollar. Foreign investors have pulled out more than 30 billion rupees ($169.5 million) since the crisis unfolded on Oct. 26. 
Wickremesinghe loyalists allege that Rajapaksa's party is trying to buy lawmakers for as much as $3 million each. Rajapaksa loyalists have rejected the allegation.
Both Sirisena and many Rajapaksa loyalists have said they have the majority in parliament. However, the no confidence motion against Rajapaksa and his government was passed twice by 122 votes in the 225-member parliament.
Most foreign countries, including Western nations, have yet to recognize Rajapaksa as the prime minister.
Last week, eight Western countries stayed away from a meeting with the government to register their protest against Sirisena's decision to dissolve parliament.

Nguyen Huu Tin, 61, was accused of ""violating regulations on state asset management and use, causing serious consequences"", the Ministry of Public Security said in a statement.
The arrest came as police widen their investigations into the wrongdoings related to a fugitive Vietnamese tycoon, Phan Van Anh Vu, the ministry said. 
Vu, who fled to Singapore seeking passage to Germany but was arrested in Vietnam earlier this year, was jailed for nine years in July for deliberate disclosure of state secrets.
The ministry didn't specify the link between Tin and Vu, but said on Monday that Tin was involved in violations at two land slots in Ho Chi Minh City.
Police also arrested two former officials of the city's department of natural resources and environment for alleged involvement in the case, the ministry said. 
Vietnam is intensifying a crackdown on corruption, following last month's election of President Nguyen Phu Trong, the Communist Party chief and architect of the crackdown.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday lashed out at U.S. President Donald Trump following his remarks that Pakistan doesn't ""do a damn thing"" for the United States despite billions of dollars in U.S. aid for the South Asian nation.
The friction threatens to further worsen already fragile relations between Islamabad and Washington, on-off allies who have repeatedly clashed about the war in Afghanistan and Pakistan's alleged support for Islamist militants. 
Khan, who assumed power in August and is known for his fiery anti-American rhetoric, said in a series of tweets that ""record needs to be put straight on Mr Trump's tirade against Pakistan"" over the weekend.
Trump, during a Fox News TV interview aired on Sunday, defended cutting aid to Islamabad and also suggested Pakistani authorities knew Osama bin Laden's location prior to his killing by U.S. troops in a raid inside Pakistan in 2011.
Pakistan denies supporting Afghan Taliban insurgents waging war against U.S.-backed troops in Afghanistan and Islamabad has also always rejected claims officials aided former al Qaeda leader bin Laden.
""Instead of making Pakistan a scapegoat for their failures, the US should do a serious assessment of why, despite 140000 NATO troops plus 250,000 Afghan troops & reportedly $1 trillion spent on war in Afghanistan, the Taliban today are stronger than before,"" Khan tweeted. 
Trump, in a pre-recorded interview, said bin Laden had been living in ""a nice mansion"" in Pakistan next to a military academy and ""everybody in Pakistan knew he was there"". 
""And we give Pakistan $1.3 billion a year. ...(bin Laden) lived in Pakistan, we're supporting Pakistan, we're giving them $1.3 billion a year - which we don't give them anymore, by the way. I ended it because they don't do anything for us, they don't do a damn thing for us.""
Khan said Pakistan had borne the brunt of the United States' war on terror, which focused on militants that straddle the Afghanistan-Pakistan tribal belt.
""No Pakistani was involved in 9/11 but Pak decided to participate in US War on Terror,"" Khan said. ""Pakistan suffered 75,000 casualties in this war & over $123 bn was lost to economy. US ""aid"" was a minuscule $20 bn."" 
Khan also pointed out that Pakistan continued to provide its roads and air space for the re-supply for more than 10,000 U.S. troops currently based in Afghanistan.

""Can Mr Trump name another ally that gave such sacrifices?""

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday avoided an early election for now after a coalition partner backed away from toppling a government hanging on to power with a razor-thin parliamentary majority.
Education Minister Naftali Bennett's U-turn surprised many pundits who had predicted the leader of the far-right Jewish Home party would quit in protest after Netanyahu rejected his demand to be named defense minister and assumed the post himself.
Netanyahu, head of the right-wing Likud party, has been making last-ditch efforts to prevent the collapse of the government, which has a majority of just one seat in parliament since Avigdor Lieberman resigned as defense chief last week.
Outflanking Netanyahu on the right, Lieberman, an ultranationalist, lashed out in his resignation announcement at the government's acceptance of a ceasefire with Gaza's dominant armed group, Hamas, amid a surge in cross-border violence
""You win some, you lose some,"" Bennett said in a televised address, shrugging off Netanyahu's rejection of his bid for the defense post, long regarded in Israel as its second most important cabinet portfolio.
Had Bennett pulled his party out of the weakened coalition, as Jewish Home officials had threatened, Netanyahu would have been left with a minority government, making an election likely ahead of a national ballot that is not due until November 2019.
Bennett said Jewish Home party was withdrawing all its political demands and would stand by the four-term prime minister.
SECURITY CHALLENGES
In a speech late on Sunday appealing to coalition partners to remain loyal, Netanyahu cited unspecified security challenges ahead and hinted at future action by Israel against its enemies.
He repeated that theme in remarks to parliament's foreign affairs and defense committee, in which he said that ""together we can surmount any challenge and ensure Israel's security"".
Such comments have left political and military affairs commentators in Israel pondering whether Netanyahu is indeed planning new military action, either in Gaza or possibly against Hezbollah guerrilla missile sites in Lebanon, or engaging in political spin that would appeal to his right-wing voter base.
An opinion poll last week suggested that Israelis, including those living outside border areas that were struck by more than 400 rockets from Gaza during the flareup, were unhappy with Netanyahu over the continued threat from the Israeli-blockaded territory.
It was a rare dip in popularity for a leader who has been on course to become Israel's longest-serving prime minister.
""National security is beyond politics,"" Netanyahu said in his speech on Sunday. ""I will not say this evening when we will act and how. I have a clear plan. I know what to do and when to do it. And we will do it.""
In his own address, Bennett said he wants to believe that Netanyahu was serious about the threats facing Israel.

If so, he said, ""I say here to the prime minister: ""We are withdrawing all our political demands and we will stand by you in this mighty task, so that Israel starts winning again.""

In a case that has shocked many Indonesians, the Supreme Court announced last week that Baiq Nuril Maknun, 37, would be jailed for six months for recording and spreading ""information violating decency"". She was also fined 500 million rupiah ($34,300).
Widowo said he could not intervene in the case, but said Maknun should request a judicial review.
""If later she does not find justice through a judicial review she can request clemency to the president, that's the procedure,"" he said in a statement.
""When the clemency request has been submitted, then it will be on my turf.""
Indonesia's #MeToo movement has gained some traction on social media with women sharing their experiences of sexual harassment but in a mainly conservative society has yet to trigger the type of impact it has had in the West.
According to media reports, Maknun was harassed by the head of a school where she worked as a contract teacher on the island of Lombok, including through sexually explicit and abusive comments on her cell phone.
She made a recording of one of the calls and it was later obtained by a co-worker in 2014 and subsequently spread on social media. In 2015, the school principal reported Maknun to police.
A court document said that Maknun had recorded the phone call without the knowledge of the headmaster and gave the recording to a third person and distributed it using an electronic device causing the principal to lose his job.
Prosecutors had taken the case to the Supreme Court after it was rejected by the court in Lombok.
""This absurd ruling by the Supreme Court appears to jail someone just for documenting the abuse they were subjected to from their employer,"" Usman Hamid, Amnesty International Indonesia's executive director, said in a statement.
More than 111,000 signatures have been submitted on an online petition demanding clemency for Maknun. 
Joko Jumadi, Maknun's lawyer, said his client intended to file a judicial review once the Supreme Court had provided a full verdict explaining its decision.

CHICO, Calif. (Reuters) - Most years, Kelly Doty marked Thanksgiving by delivering scores of meals to low-income families with children in the tight-knit Northern California mountain community of Paradise. 
But after the Camp Fire all but incinerated the town of nearly 27,000 residents on Nov. 8, killing at least 77 people and leaving almost 1,000 missing, the family resources center where Doty worked as a director had to scrap the annual food drive.
""All the families are displaced. There's no houses to deliver boxes to,"" Doty, 37, said by telephone from Battle Ground, Washington, where she and her two sons and boyfriend are staying with relatives.
She does not know the whereabouts of the 80 meals that staff at the Paradise Ridge Family Resource Center collected ahead of the holiday, or even if they survived the blaze.
Her house was reduced to rubble by the fire, as were the homes of the center's three other employees. 
Still, Doty said she had plenty to be thankful for. Her family survived and managed to escape with belongings such as family photos and children's clothing. Many of her neighbors fled with only the clothes on their backs.
""I feel like I still have a lot,"" Doty said. 
In a twist, she said they were the ones receiving charity this year. During a visit to a Battle Ground pizza restaurant last week, the owner discovered they were Camp Fire evacuees and gave them a $100 gift card and $50 bottle of wine.
The band playing that night passed a tip jar around the room on their behalf, too. ""It was just incredible, these people didn't know us and they were donating money to us,"" Doty said.
TURKEY IN THE PARK
For years in Chico, a few miles (km) west of Paradise, a 59-year-old homeless woman named ""Mama"" Rose Adams has served a Thanksgiving meal for homeless people in a park. She and her helpers buy some of the food from money they raise recycling, while the rest is donated by friends and family. 
On Sunday, she was serving 17 roasted turkeys at an event advertised on social media and flyers around town. She was encouraging evacuees from the wildfire to attend, since they are now homeless too.
""I'm sure a lot of them are uncomfortable now,"" Adams said at the park where a few dozen people sat at picnic tables to eat. ""A lot of them don't have places to cook or eat.""
Among the displaced in Chico was Sonya Butts, her twin sister, Tonya Boyd, and their families. They had been among those hoping for a Thanksgiving meal parcel from Doty's center. 
The Camp Fire may have taken her home, her job and her town, Butts said, but it left her with the things that matter most to her.
""Being alive, knowing my husband and my kids got out alive, that's all I ever wanted,"" Butts, 28, said by phone from a Red Cross evacuation shelter at Bidwell Junior High School. 
Butts, her sister and their families are lucky to be alive after a harrowing escape. They fled in a four-car caravan as the wildfire all but surrounded them, eventually reaching Chico where they watched their hometown burn in the hills behind them.
Still, Butts counts her blessings.

""Everything else can be replaced,"" she said. ""My family cannot.""

960,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2018 05:55AM ET</span>",Iranian jobs go as U.S. sanctions start to bite,"By Bozorgmehr Sharafedin
LONDON (Reuters) - Tamnoush, an Iranian company that makes fizzy drinks, has shut down its production line after 16 years and laid off dozens of workers. It was facing massive losses as U.S. sanctions pushed up the price of imported raw materials.
""All our 45 workers are jobless now. The men are driving taxis and women are back to being housewives,"" said CEO Farzad Rashidi.
Reuters interviews with dozens of business owners across Iran show hundreds of companies have suspended production and thousands of workers are being laid off because of a hostile business climate mainly caused by new U.S. sanctions.
The Iranian rial has fallen to record lows and economic activity has slowed dramatically since U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the big powers' nuclear deal with Tehran in May.
He imposed sanctions directed at purchases of U.S. dollars, gold trading, and the automotive industry in August. Iran's vital oil and banking sectors were hit in November.
""We have lost around five billion rials ($120,000 at the official rate) in the last few months, so the board decided to suspend all activities for as long as the fluctuations in the currency market continue. It is stupid to keep driving when you see it's a dead end,"" Rashidi said.
The country has already experienced unrest this year, when young protesters angered by unemployment and high prices clashed with security forces. Official projections indicate unrest could flare up again as sanctions make the economic crisis worse.
Four days before parliament fired him August for failing to do enough to protect the jobs market from sanctions, labor minister Ali Rabiei said Iran would lose a million jobs by the end of year as a direct result of the U.S. measures. 
Unemployment is already running at 12.1 percent, with three million Iranians unable to find jobs.
A parliamentary report in September warned that rising unemployment could threaten the stability of the Islamic Republic.
""If we believe that the country's economic situation was the main driver for the recent protests, and that an inflation rate of 10 percent and an unemployment rate of 12 percent caused the protests, we cannot imagine the intensity of reactions caused by the sharp rise of inflation rate and unemployment.""
The report said if Iran's economic growth remains below 5 percent in coming years, unemployment could hit 26 percent.
The International Monetary Fund has forecast that Iran’s economy will contract by 1.5 percent this year and by 3.6 percent in 2019 due to dwindling oil revenues.
PRODUCERS STRUGGLING 
Iran's vice president has warned that under sanctions Iran faces two main dangers: unemployment and a reduction in purchasing power.
""Job creation should be the top priority ... We should not allow productive firms to fall into stagnation because of sanctions,"" Eshaq Jahangiri said, according to state media.
But business owners told Reuters that the government's sometimes contradictory monetary policies, alongside fluctuations in the foreign exchange market, price increases for raw materials, and high interest loans from banks have made it impossible for them to stay in business. 
Many have not been able to pay wages for months or had to shed significant numbers of workers.
A manager at the Jolfakaran Aras Company, one of the biggest textile factories in Iran, told Reuters that the firm was considering halting its operations and hundreds of workers might lose their jobs.
""Around 200 workers were laid off in August, and the situation has become worse since. There is a high possibility that the factory will shut down,"" the manager said, asking not to be named.
Ahmad Roosta, CEO of Takplast Nour, was hopeful that a drought in Iran would provide a boost for his newly launched factory, which produces plastic pipes used in agriculture.
""I will wait one or two months, but I will have to shut down if the situation remains the same ... The farmers, who are the main consumers of our products, cannot afford them,"" Roosta told Reuters.
The sanctions have affected the Iranian car industry, which had experienced a boom after sanctions were lifted two years ago and it signed big contracts with French and German firms.
French carmaker PSA Group (PA:PEUP) suspended its joint venture in Iran in June to avoid U.S. sanctions, and German car and truck manufacturer Daimler has dropped plans to expand its Iran business.
Maziar Beiglou, a board member of the Iran Auto Parts Makers Association, said in August that more than 300 auto parts makers have been forced to stop production, threatening tens of thousands of jobs in the sector.
A spokesperson for Iran's Tire Producers Association blamed the government's ""changing monetary policies over the last six months"" for problems in the sector.
""Fortunately tire factories have not slowed down, but the production growth that we had planned for was not achieved,” Mostafa Tanha said in a phone interview from Tehran.
YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT
Washington says economic pressures on Tehran are directed at the government and its malign proxies in the region, not at the Iranian people. But Iran's young people, bearing the brunt of unemployment, stand to lose the most. 
Maryam, a public relations manager in a food import company, lost her job last month. 
""The prices went so high that we lost many customers ... In the end the CEO decided to lay off people and started with our department.""
She said the company had stopped importing, and people who still worked there were worried that it might shut down after selling off its inventory.
Youth unemployment is already 25 percent in a country where 60 percent of the 80 million population is under 30. 
The unemployment rate among young people with higher education in some parts of the country is above 50 percent, according to official data. 
Armin, 29, has a mechanical engineering degree but lost his job in the housebuilding industry when the sector was hit by recession following the fall of rial.
""The property market is slowing because high prices have made houses unaffordable ... It is getting worse day by day,"" he told Reuters from the city of Rasht in northern Iran. 
Nima, a legal adviser for startups and computer firms, believes sanctions have already affected many companies in the sector that depended on an export-oriented model and hoped to expand in the region. 
He said even the gaming industry in Iran has felt the sanctions pinch: ""The situation has become so severe that many of these teams decided to suspend development of their games and are waiting to see what will happen next. Without access to international markets, they see very little chance of making a profit."" 
Saeed Laylaz, a Tehran-based economist, was more sanguine. He said youth unemployment was a product of Iran's demographics and government policies, and sanctions were only adding to an existing problem.
""The sanctions, the uncertainty in the market and Rouhani's zigzag policies have put pressures on the economy and the job market, but I predict that the market will find a balance soon,"" Laylaz told Reuters. 

""We will defeat this round of sanctions as we have done in the past,"" said Laylaz who met Rouhani last month with other economists to offer advice on economic policies.

(Reuters) - Iran will continue to export oil despite U.S. sanctions, which are part of a psychological war doomed to failure, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Monday.
By reimposing sanctions on OPEC's third biggest crude producer, Washington wants to force Tehran to drop its ballistic missile programs, further curb its nuclear work and limit its support for proxy militias from Syria to Lebanon and Yemen.
""We will not yield to this pressure, which is part of the psychological war launched against Iran,"" Rouhani said in a speech in the city of Khoy, broadcast live on state television.
""They have failed to stop our oil exports. We will keep exporting it ... Your regional policies have failed and you blame Iran for that failure from Afghanistan to Yemen and Syria,"" he added, to chants of ""Death to America!"".
Rouhani said Washington lacked the necessary international support for its sanctions, and noted that it had granted temporary waivers to eight major buyers of Iranian oil.
""America is isolated now. Iran is supported by many countries. Except for the Zionist regime (Israel) and some countries in the region, no other country backs America's pressure on Iran,"" he said.
The European Union, France, Germany, Britain, Russia and China, participants with the United States in the 2015 deal that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program, have been trying to find ways to circumvent the U.S. limitations. 
In particular, the EU has been trying to establish a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for non-dollar trade with Iran.
But this has not stopped foreign businesses ranging from oil companies and trading houses to firms leaving Iran for fear of incurring U.S. penalties.
Iran has threatened to exit the deal if its economic benefits are not preserved, but Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi told a news conference that it remained ""hopeful that the Europeans can save the deal"".
The SPV was conceived as a clearing house that could be used to help match Iranian oil and gas exports against purchases of EU goods, circumventing the U.S. sanctions, which are based on the global use of the dollar for oil trade. 
The EU wanted to have the SPV set up by this month, but no country has offered to host it, six diplomats told Reuters last week.

""We expect EU to implement the SPV as soon as possible,"" Qasemi said. ""Iran adheres to its commitments as long as other signatories honor theirs.""

LAGOS/ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigerian opposition candidate Atiku Abubakar will seek to boost investment in the oil sector if he becomes president next year, according to a draft copy of his manifesto.
He plans to re-consider introducing bidding rounds for marginal fields and oil blocks, privatizing government-owned crude refineries and issuing new licenses for greenfield investments in refineries, the draft said.
In the presidential election scheduled for February, Abubakar, the main opposition People's Democratic Party candidate, will seek to prevent President Muhammadu Buhari from securing a second term.
Nigeria's is Africa's largest producer of crude and remains largely dependent on sales of oil, which make up roughly two-thirds of government revenues, despite years of administration promises to diversify the economy. 
Abubakar's draft re-iterated his plan to partially privatize state oil firm Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).
He has taken a pro-business stance that he says will boost Nigeria's economy, which has struggled since Buhari took office.
A large part of that is due to global oil price declines outside the administration's control, though Buhari's government has tried to keep tight control of exchange rates as the naira weakened, discouraging foreign investors.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - All Taiwan wanted to do was to host rugby teams from around the region for a series of matches. 
Instead, Chinese representatives challenged the self-ruled island's proposal this summer, saying China should take over the events. After a month of negotiations, the two sides agreed to take turns hosting the games over the next six years. 
Rugby is a minor sport in both places, but diplomats and officials say the spat illustrates China's willingness to swipe at Taiwan over the pettiest of points. 
""They want to entirely block our sporting events. If we are to host one, they will either try to kill it, or try to take the hosting rights from you,"" Chinese Taipei Rugby Football Union General Secretary Jeremy Pai, who is involved in the negotiations with China, told Reuters.
The Chinese Rugby Football Association said the challenge simply aimed to promote rugby in China and had no political motivation. 
From a painted-over Taiwan flag after a Chinese complaint in Australia, the revocation of an Olympic game in Taiwan, and the sudden absence of two Chinese players in a Taiwan golf competition, China is using the international stage to assert its sovereignty over the island.
China regards Taiwan as a wayward province and has grown increasingly suspicious that the government of President Tsai Ing-wen wants to push for formal independence.
The rising Chinese pressure, which also includes military drills and the snatching of the island's dwindling number of diplomatic allies, comes ahead of Taiwanese mayoral and magisterial elections this weekend that are seen as a bellwether for the ruling party's performance in the 2020 presidential race.
Diplomats and observers say no front appears off limits for China in its efforts to diminish Taiwan's stature. In recent months, that has included rising Chinese scrutiny over how companies from airlines, such as Air Canada, to retailers, such as Gap, refer to the democratic island.
China, which sees Taiwan as the most sensitive issue between it and the United States, is working to stamp out even simple references to the island internationally, they said. 
""China is willing to break international norms to pursue its narrow interests,"" said a person with direct knowledge of the matter who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. 
'DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD'
In May, a Taiwan flag students painted on a statue at an Australian festival was covered by local authorities after Chinese consular officers from in Brisbane reported a ""problem."" 
""The Australian government's agreement with China is that Australia does not recognize Taiwan as a separate country,"" Margaret Strelow, mayor of Rockhampton in central Queensland, wrote in a statement after the incident. 
But officials in Taiwan said the Chinese pressure could be counterproductive, as public resentment toward Beijing runs high.
More than 80 percent of Taiwanese think China's bid to squeeze the island's international space hurts cross-strait ties, an August poll from Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council showed. 
""China should think whether such moves would backfire,"" said Yao Chia-wen, a senior adviser to the president, adding that Beijing's ""double-edged sword"" could reinforce public support for Tsai's independence-leaning Diplomatic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party. 
Some are ready to challenge China, which has never renounced the use of force against Taiwan. 
A referendum popular among younger Taiwanese, which will be on the ballot this weekend, seems calculated to rile Beijing: It asks whether the island should join the 2020 Tokyo Olympics as Taiwan, rather than ""Chinese Taipei"" – the name agreed to under a compromise in the late 1970s. 

""The Chinese suppression on Taiwan will not stop until it was unified by China,"" Taiwanese volleyball player Huang Pei-hung wrote in a post widely shared on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to rally support for the referendum. ""Please work hard to help rectify Taiwan's name.""

KABUL (Reuters) - A three-day meeting between the Taliban and the U.S. special envoy for Afghanistan to pave the way for peace talks ended with no agreement, the militant group said a day after the diplomat declared a deadline of April 2019 to end a 17-year-long war. 
Afghanistan's security situation has worsened since NATO formally ended combat operations in 2014, as Taliban insurgents battle to reimpose strict Islamic law following their overthrow in 2001 at the hands of U.S.-led troops.
Leaders of the hardline Islamist group met U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad at their political headquarters in Qatar last week for the second time in the past month, said spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid.
""These were preliminary talks and no agreement was reached on any issue,"" he said in a statement on Monday. 
Taliban leaders had not accepted any deadline set by the U.S. to wrap up talks, three Taliban officials added. 
The U.S embassy in Kabul declined to comment.
Khalilzad, an Afghan-born US diplomat authorized by U.S. President Donald Trump's government to lead peace negotiations with the Taliban, on Sunday said he hoped to cut a peace deal with the group by April 20.
That deadline coincides with the date set for presidential elections in Afghanistan.
Two senior U.S. officials confirmed that the second round of peace talks ended last week and the Taliban expected Khalilzad to visit Qatar for a meeting before the end of 2018.
""The second round of talks went on for three days. This clearly proves that both sides are exercising patience and caution during their diplomatic engagement,"" a U.S. official said on condition of anonymity.
But Khalilzad's public statement that the Taliban believe they will ""not win militarily"" angered senior members of the group, who warned U.S. officials against mixed messages that could muddle the peace process.
""We were astonished to see Khalilzad's statement in Kabul on Sunday. He wrongly quoted us, saying that the Taliban admitted that militarily we would not succeed,"" said a senior Taliban member in Afghanistan.
Another senior member said Khalilzad's strategy to declare a deadline showed how desperate the U.S. was to withdraw foreign forces. ""Taliban leaders have not agreed to any deadline because we are winning on all fronts,"" he added.
The Taliban ""are not losing"" in Afghanistan, Gen. Joseph Dunford, the top U.S. military officer, said last week.
""We used the term stalemate a year ago and, relatively speaking, it has not changed much,"" he told a security forum.
The NATO-led Resolute Support mission involves 41 nations contributing more than 12,000 soldiers, equipment and training for Afghan forces. 
The Taliban have strengthened their grip over the past three years, with the government in Kabul controlling just 56 percent of the country, down from 72 percent in 2015, a U.S. government report showed this month. 
Diplomats and political analysts in Kabul have labeled Khalilzad a man ""in hurry"" who must include Afghan politicians and officials from neighboring countries such as Pakistan and Iran before the third round of talks.

""Khalilzad's hasty approach could lead to an epic disaster,"" said a senior Western diplomat in Kabul. ""The Taliban would trust him only if he did not speak on their behalf.""

The author, surnamed Liu, was found guilty on Oct. 31 by Wuhu county court in eastern Anhui province after she self-published a book that ""obscenely and in detail described gay male-male acts"", according to state media. 
The court ruled that the strict sentence was enforced due to her having made 150,000 yuan ($21,600) by selling over 7,000 copies, the article said. 
The case went viral on Chinese social media at the weekend as commentators asked how such a punishment made sense when some sexual assault cases often drew lighter sentences. 
One user shared an article about a case from 2010 when a man was jailed for 18 months for imprisoning children and commented: ""I don't understand the law, but there have been people who did things as inhuman as this and only get a year and a half.
""Why can't our vast and abundant China tolerate the word 'sex'?"" the user added.
Some commentators suggested Liu's book should not be banned as gay erotic content known as ""bl"" or ""BoysLove"" is important for Chinese men to discover their sexuality.
""I also watch 'bl', because my family has traditional values,"" one user wrote about the case. ""Seeing this news today, and based on this kind of criminal law, I expect we will have to wait thousands of years for homosexuality to be legalized.""
Pornography has long been illegal in China, but in recent years, the Communist Party has intensified efforts to clear away what it sees as inappropriate content, introducing new legislation, rewards and punishments to help its aims.
Authorities on Saturday launched a campaign to ""eradicate pornography and illegal publications"" by offering heightened rewards of up to 600,000 yuan for reporting banned content to the police, starting from December.
In April, Weibo announced a decision to remove pornographic, violent or gay content, singling out manga animations that often depict raunchy gay male relationships, but then reversed its decision after widespread criticism.

At Saturday's ceremony, held in Taipei, documentary film maker Fu Yue called for Taiwan to be recognized as ""an independent entity"", sparking off a live sparring match between mainland and Taiwanese stars at the glitzy show.
Mainland actor Tu Men, while presenting an award, referred to Taiwan as ""China Taiwan"", while the chair of the awards committee, Oscar award-winning director Ang Lee, told reporters after the show that everyone was allowed to say what they wanted to say on stage.
However, he added: ""We hope that art can be art, and that no political issues will interfere with it because art is very pure.""
Taiwan is self-governed and has a democratically elected leadership, but China claims the island as a breakaway province and has not ruled out the use of force to ensure unification. The question of Taiwanese independence is one of Beijing's most sensitive political concerns.
Tensions between China and Taiwan have grown since pro-independence President Tsai Ing-wen took power in 2016. Taiwan is now preparing for local elections on Saturday, seen as a bellwether for the ruling party's performance in the 2020 presidential race.
Tsai herself weighed into the debate on Sunday saying that Taiwan had never accepted being called ""China Taiwan"". 
""We can't accept this term. Taiwan is simply Taiwan,"" she said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), adding she was ""proud"" of the awards ceremony which ""highlighted that Taiwan was different from China, that being in our freedom and diversity"".
""Taiwan is a democratic and open society,"" she said. ""No one here will be silenced or disappeared because they have different views. We have no sensitive words that will be censored online.""
Social media users also left close to 20,000 comments on Fu's Facebook account after the show, with some criticizing her support for Taiwan independence while others praised it. Some said she should not have politicized the ceremony. 
In a separate statement on Monday, Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party said the criticism of Fu was an attempt at ""election interference from outside forces"".
The Golden Horse Awards was one of the most discussed topics on China's Twitter-like Weibo platform on Sunday, with a number of mainland stars also posting supportive posts about China's claims over Taiwan.
Among them was A-list Chinese movie star Fan Bingbing, who earlier this year vanished for months from public view sparking widespread rumors about her whereabouts. She was fined for tax evasion last month and in her apology said her achievements were inseparable from the Communist Party.
Her Weibo post was her first since she issued her apology last month.

""China cannot be reduced even just a tiny bit,"" she wrote, alongside a map of Chinese territory, including Taiwan.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Three leaders of Hong Kong's 2014 pro-democracy ""Occupy"" movement, which paralyzed parts of the Chinese-ruled city for nearly three months, denied public nuisance charges on Monday as international criticism of the erosion of civil liberties grows.
Law professor Benny Tai, 54, retired sociologist Chan Kin-man, 59, and retired pastor Chu Yiu-ming, 74, face charges of conspiracy and incitement to commit public nuisance, and incitement to incite public nuisance.
The closely watched trial illustrates the tensions in the former British colony as disaffected democracy activists push back against attempts by Communist Party leaders in Beijing to tighten their grip on the city's freedoms and autonomy.
Each charge carries a maximum jail term of seven years. Six others, including two lawmakers, are also facing public nuisance charges in a trial that is expected to last around 20 days.
In a show of defiance, the nine defendants and more than 100 supporters unfurled yellow umbrellas, a symbol of the movement, outside the courthouse, clapping and cheering.
They chanted for ""real universal suffrage"" and for an end to what critics say is tantamount to ""political persecution"" for what was conceived as a peaceful civil disobedience campaign.
All nine denied the charges, including activist Raphael Wong who shouted out ""I want universal suffrage"" when entering his plea.
Chan announced last week that he would take early retirement from the Chinese University of Hong Kong to avoid the risk of being fired. Tai told Reuters he hoped the trial would be an opportunity to ""reboot the spirit of the people"".
Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" formula, with the guarantee of a high degree of autonomy and freedoms denied citizens in mainland China, including freedom of speech and the right to protest.
However, critics, including foreign governments, business groups and activists, say that the guarantee is ringing increasingly hollow.
'UNLAWFUL' OCCUPATIONS
The court heard how in 2013, Tai, Chan and Chu began promulgating and planning a non-violent civil disobedience campaign to occupy streets in the Central business district should China not allow a democratic vote for its next leader.
The ""Occupy"" campaign germinated in September 2014, ahead of schedule, and became part of what grew into the biggest populist challenge to Beijing since the Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ) demonstrations in Beijing in 1989.
Hundreds of thousands of people, including many youngsters and students, took to the streets in sustained occupation of major streets.
Government prosecutor Andrew Bruce detailed in court how the three ""Occupy"" leaders had given speeches and interviews urging more people to join the protest.
He said this had been a ""joint enterprise"" to conspire with others to try to fuel the movement for a ""prolonged and indefinite"" time.
Lawyers for the defendants, however, questioned the basis for this allegation. 
The five other defendants are veteran democratic party member Lee Wing-tat, democratic lawmakers Tanya Chan and Shiu Ka-chun, and student leaders Tommy Cheung and Eason Chung. 
Some lawyers say the case could have repercussions for hundreds of other protesters who have not been charged.
The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission warned in a report to Congress last week that China had ""ramped up its interference"" in Hong Kong and had ""closed down the political space for pro-democracy activists to express discontent"".
Authorities have banned a political party advocating Hong Kong independence, barred democracy activists from contesting local elections and disqualified six opposition lawmakers from the legislature.
A senior Financial Times journalist, Victor Mallet, was barred from the city this month after he helped host an independence activist at the Foreign Correspondents' Club in what critics said was an attack on freedom of speech.

Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has repeatedly stressed Hong Kong respects media and other freedoms but has so far refused to give an explanation for denying Mallet entry.

In May, U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned the deal, negotiated with five other world powers during Democratic President Barack Obama's administration. The United States also restored sanctions targeting Iran's oil, banking and transportation sectors earlier this month.
""He will meet (Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad) Zarif today and the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council Ali Shamkhani,"" state TV reported. 
Shamkhani is an ally of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the last say on all state matters, including nuclear issues. 
Hunt's office said in a statement that, during his meeting with Zarif, he would stress that the UK is committed to the nuclear deal as long as Iran sticks to its terms. He will also discuss European efforts to maintain nuclear-related sanctions relief. 
Other signatories of the deal, the European Union, France, Germany, Britain, Russia and China, have been searching for ways to salvage the pact. 
""The Iran nuclear deal remains a vital component of stability in the Middle East by eliminating the threat of a nuclearized Iran. It needs 100 percent compliance though to survive,"" Hunt said in a statement ahead of the visit.
Iran has warned it could scrap the accord if the bloc fails to preserve the deal’s economic benefits against U.S. pressure.
""We will stick to our side of the bargain as long as Iran does. But we also need to see an end to destabilizing activity by Iran in the rest of the region if we are going to tackle the root causes of the challenges the region faces,"" Hunt said.
Under the deal, Iran restricted its disputed nuclear program, widely seen in the West as a disguised effort to develop the means to make atomic bombs, in exchange for an end to international sanctions.
Hunt will also discuss Iran's role in the conflicts in Syria and Yemen, his office said, and press Iran on its human rights record, calling for the immediate release of detained British-Iranian dual nationals where there are humanitarian grounds to do so.

""I arrive in Iran with a clear message for the country's leaders: putting innocent people in prison cannot and must not be used as a tool of diplomatic leverage,"" he said.

969,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2018 01:47AM ET</span>","Chinese city urges those 'poisoned by extremism', who follow conservative Islam to confess crimes","BEIJING (Reuters) - A city in China's far-western Xinjiang region has ordered people who are ""poisoned by extremism, terrorism and separatism"", in contact with overseas terror groups or act in a conservative Islamic manner, to turn themselves in to authorities.
Those who surrender to judicial organs within 30 days and confess to their crimes will be treated leniently and might avoid punishment, said a notice posted on Sunday on the official social media account of the Hami city government.
Beijing has in recent months faced an outcry from activists, academics and foreign governments over mass detentions and strict surveillance of the Muslim Uighur minority and other ethnic groups that live in Xinjiang.
China rejects the criticism, saying that it protects the religion and culture of minorities in the region and that its security measures are needed to combat the influence of ""extremist"" groups that incite violence there.
""All individuals involved in terrorist crimes and poisoned by the 'three evil forces' are urged to surrender themselves to the judicial organs within 30 days and to confess and hand over the facts of your crime,"" said the Hami city notice.
The notice issued by the municipal ""leading small group for stability maintenance"" says that actions ranging from being in contact with overseas ""terror"" groups to conservative Islamic behavior should prompt individuals to turn themselves in.
Advocating that people live their entire lives in accordance with the Koran, stopping other people from watching television, or banning alcohol, smoking and dancing at weddings are listed as behaviors that should warrant informing the authorities.
The list also included openly destroying, rejecting or thwarting the government identification system, as well as rejecting government provided housing, subsidies and cigarettes or booze as being ""haram"" or forbidden.
Those who turn themselves in on time will be treated leniently, and if the information provides a significant clue, then they might avoid all punishment, the notice said.
In August, a United Nations human rights panel said it had received many credible reports that a million or more Uighurs and other minorities are being held in what resembles a “massive internment camp that is shrouded in secrecy” in Xinjiang.
China says it is not enforcing arbitrary detention and political re-education.
Aside from the mass detentions, rights groups also say that the Chinese government has significantly raised limitations on everyday religious observances in the region.
Last month, the region's capital Urumqi launched a campaign targeting halal products, like food and toothpaste, which are produced according to Islamic law, in order to prevent what it sees as the incursion of Islam into secular life.

The Asia Times, citing unidentified diplomatic sources and analysts, reported on Thursday that Beijing had been lobbying Cambodia since 2017 for the naval base, which could host frigates, destroyers and other vessels of the People's Liberation Army Navy.
""Does Cambodia need to violate its Constitution to allow a foreign military base on Cambodian territory?"" Information Minister Khieu Kanharith quoted Hun Sen as saying on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) during a Cabinet meeting on Monday.
""With whom does Cambodia need foreign troops to fight with?,"" Hun Sen said, according to Khieu Kanharith. ""And I do not need foreigners to fight in Cambodian territory like in the past, nor does Cambodia allow her to be a place for ideology or weapon experiment,"" he said.
The possible naval base is thought to be part of a project by China's Tianjin Union Development Group (UDG), which began work in 2008 on 45,000 hectares of land in a national park for 99 years.
There has been little information about the $3.8 billion project or its progress. 
UDG was also to spend $45 million on the port, which The Asia Times report described as a naval base.
Cambodia-based Sawac Consultants for Development, commissioned by Cambodia's environment ministry, said the port would be able to handle up to four 20,000-tonne container ships.
The port was guarded by Cambodian military and appeared unfinished when Reuters visited in June.
China, Hun Sen's strongest regional ally, has poured billions of dollars in development assistance and loans into Cambodia through bilateral frameworks and China's Belt and Road initiative.
The initiative, unveiled by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013, aims to bolster a sprawling network of land and sea links with Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa.

It has attracted a flood of Chinese commercial ventures in Cambodia, including casinos and special economic zones.

The Southeast Asian nation has one of the world's toughest laws concerning insults against its revered monarchy, with violations liable to attract jail terms of up to 15 years. It also affects what news organizations in Thailand, including Reuters, can report on the subject. 
A Nov. 4 episode depicts one of the show's main characters traveling to Thailand for a talk by a speaker who gets arrested for insulting the monarchy.
The fictional U.S. secretary of state in the CBS show also highlights the Thai law on royal insults, saying, ""Thailand is a country where free speech doesn't exist."" 
A Thai foreign ministry spokeswoman said it had asked the embassy in Washington D.C. to notify the show's producers of its concerns over the episode.
""The foreign ministry has asked the Thai embassy in Washington D.C. to convey our concerns on the content of the show's particular episode, which touches upon Thailand and the monarchy institution,"" Busadee Santipitaks told Reuters. 
""We lodged a complaint that the producers of the show didn't consider the sensitivity of the matter.""

Beltran Leyva had been incarcerated since March 2, 2016 in Federal Prison Number 1, a maximum security facility in central Altiplano, Mexico, where he was facing federal prosecution for various crimes, the Mexico Interior Ministry said in a statement announcing the death.
Nicknamed ""the H,"" according to the statement, Beltran Leyva's capture in 2014 near a town where he had posed as an art and real estate dealer was seen as a major victory for Mexican authorities in their decade-long war against drug gangs.

Guzman is currently facing trial for drug trafficking in federal court in Brooklyn.
Authorities said Beltran Leyva, 56, was transferred on Sunday from prison to hospital minutes after security officers noticed he had severe pain in his chest that did not respond to first aid from prison doctors.

Sirisena called the all party leaders' meeting after Rajapaksa, his choice to lead the government, was voted out twice within days by a majority in a no-confidence motion. 
A lawmaker loyal to Sirisena told reporters that the president rejected the outcome of the second vote held on Friday, which potentially strengthened the hand of Ranil Wickremesinghe who is seeking to return as prime minister.
""To decide on the no confidence motion presented against the government, president noted that he wanted a vote with a name call or electronically displayed,"" Sirisena's office said in a statement.
The country's parliament descended into chaos for a third straight day last Friday as lawmakers supporting Rajapaksa threw books, chili paste, water bottles and furniture at the speaker to try to disrupt the no-confidence vote. 
Sirisena's office said all the party leaders at the Sunday meeting agreed to have a disciplined legislature when proceedings start on Monday.
Parliament Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and Anura Kumara Dissanayake, leader of the Marxist Janatha Vimukthi Peremuna (JVP) party, did not participate in the meeting.
""We believe that refusing to accept the formerly adopted no-confidence motion that rejects the appointment of the nominal premiership and coming out with various types of cheap excuses are not appropriate for a President of a country,"" Dissanayake said in a letter to Sirisena, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.
Sirisena late last month removed and replaced Wickremesinghe with Rajapaksa, plunging the island off India's southeast coast into political turmoil.
With parliament scheduled to reconvene on Monday, Sirisena appears faced with the choice of either re-appointing Wickremesinghe, whom he has said he will not bring back, or allowing the crisis to fester.
Wickremesinghe's party said it was ready for a ""floor test"" in parliament to prove it had majority support for the ousted prime minister.
""Mahinda Rajapaksa should (be) subject to a floor test. The so-called prime minister should show his majority in Parliament and if the speaker's rulings are wrong, you can bring a motion to cancel those motions,” Lakshman Kiriella, a Wickremesinghe loyalist, told reporters after Sunday's meeting.

978,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2018 06:20PM ET</span>","Two years after Philippines' pivot, Duterte still waiting on China dividend","By Karen Lema and Martin Petty
MANILA (Reuters) - Two years after Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte announced a divorce with old ally the United States in return for bumper business ties with China, he doesn't have much to show for it.
Duterte left Beijing in 2016 with $24 billion of Chinese loans and investment pledges for his ambitious infrastructure overhaul, a few weeks after saying the Philippines was being treated like a dog by Washington and would be better off with China.
But only a fraction of China's pledged support has materialized, exposing Duturte to criticisms he has been complicit in allowing China to pose threats to Philippines' sovereignty, and been left high and dry by Beijing.
When Xi Jinping visits the Philippines this week, Duterte will need the Chinese president to put his money where his mouth is and help Duterte justify his geopolitical concessions to a historic rival, according to Richard Heydarian, a Manila-based defense and security analyst.
""Otherwise, we can definitely conclude that there's really nothing much in the rhetoric and the Philippines has been taken for a ride,"" Heydarian said. 
""Duterte's naivety with China has been a slam dunk strategic coup for China, no doubt about it.""
Philippine's Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno said it would be unreasonable to expect all the Chinese pledges to come through after only two years, but officials were hopeful intervention by Xi after his visit could help.
""We're very optimistic this will, their head of state, will pressure their bureaucracy to speed up the process,"" he said last week.
Duterte's signature ""Build, Build, Build"" infrastructure program, the centerpiece of his economic strategy, involves 75 flagship projects of which about half are earmarked for Chinese loans, grants or investments.
But according to publicly available Philippine government documents reviewed by Reuters, only three of those - two bridges and an irrigation facility worth a combined $167 million - have so far broken ground.
The rest, including three rail projects, three highways and nine bridges, are at various levels of planning and budgeting, or are awaiting Chinese government approval for financing, or the nomination of Chinese contractors. 
'POSITIVE RESULTS'
China's foreign ministry said major projects agreed by both sides ""are proceeding smoothly and continue to achieve positive results"". China wanted to boost trade and investment and ""promote the early commencement of building of even more agreed upon projects,"" the ministry said in a statement to Reuters. 
Chinese committed investments in the Philippines in the first half of this year were just $33 million, about 40 percent of that of the United States and about a seventh of Japan's, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority, tracking a similar trend the previous year.
Trade between China and the Philippines has picked up significantly, but data suggests mostly in China's favor. 
Chinese exports to the Philippines grew 26 percent in the first nine months of 2017 from the same period a year earlier, outpacing its imports from Manila, which grew 9.8 percent.
Net foreign direct investment from China has, however, surged to $181 million for the first eight months of this year, from $28.8 million for all of 2017, according to the Philippine central bank.
PRESSURE NEEDED
Duterte has made a point of praising China effusively and confessing his ""love"" for Xi. He even jokingly offered his country to Beijing as ""a province of China"".
Many ordinary Filipinos as well as international lawyers and diplomats are incensed by Duterte's refusal to even raise with China the Permanent Court of Arbitration's (PCA) 2016 award that ruled in the Philippines' favor, and invalidated Beijing's claim to most of the South China Sea.
Instead, Duterte is seeking an agreement with China to jointly explore offshore gas at the disputed Reed Bank in the resource-rich and strategic waterway. Some lawmakers fear that could be tantamount to recognizing Beijing's claim to a site that the PCA ruling said China has no sovereign rights to under international law.
Duterte has also been against Southeast Asian countries taking a united stand against China militarization and at a regional summit last week, he warned against causing friction, because the South China Sea was ""now in their (China's) hands"". 
Heydarian said if Duterte was unable to show an economic dividend from his China gambit, it could weaken his hand ahead of 2019 mid-term elections that might determine the success or failure of his presidency.
To stand a chance of delivering on his policy agenda, Duterte needs his allies to command a majority in Congress and the Senate to ensure key legislation is passed to enable reforms aimed at generating revenue, attracting investment and creating higher-quality jobs.
""If after Xi Jinping's visit, there's still no big move by China to invest in the Philippines, if China's militarization and reclamation will just continue unabated, you're going to have a situation where Duterte will come under extreme pressure,"" he said. 

""The opposition is going to use that to pin down Duterte and his allies as Chinese lackeys.""

Garcia entered the embassy and home of the Uruguayan ambassador in a residential Lima neighborhood on Saturday night and requested asylum, according to a statement from the foreign ministry.
Garcia ""has requested asylum from that country, in accordance with the provisions of the Convention on Diplomatic Asylum of 1954, of which Peru and Uruguay are parties,"" the foreign ministry said, adding the request ""should be evaluated by the government of Uruguay.""
Officials at the Uruguayan embassy did not immediately respond to request for comment.
Garcia's asylum request came hours after a judge ruled on Saturday to prohibit the ex-president from leaving the country for 18 months while under investigation for bribes allegedly received during the construction of an electric train in Lima by Brazilian company Odebrecht.
Garcia, who mostly resides in Spain, arrived in Lima on Thursday to testify in the case before a prosecutor, who postponed the hearing and requested the former president be barred from leaving.
The prosecutor in the case, Jose Perez, also accused Garcia of receiving $100,000 for taking part in a conference in Brazil, and said the money likely came from an Odebrecht fund, used to pay out bribes in several Latin American countries.
The sweeping Odebrecht corruption scandal has implicated dozens of high-ranking officials across Latin America, who have been accused of taking bribe money in exchange for public works contracts.
On Saturday, after hearing the judge's decision to ban his departure from the country, Garcia had said he was not afraid of the ruling and would answer all the accusations before the courts.
""All this amounts to an escalation, in a move to start fires to distract from the unemployment situation in the country,"" Garcia told journalists from the doorstep of his home in Lima.
Garcia held Peru's presidency twice, from 1985-1990 and again from 2006-2011. 

It is the second time that Garcia, 69, has sought asylum in a South American country while facing corruption charges. In 1992, Garcia applied for asylum in the Colombian embassy in Lima, while he was being investigated for corruption and illicit enrichment during his first term as president.

They said jihadists dug into the Tulul al Safa heights, east of Sweida province, had begun their retreat in the last few days as Syrian army tanks backed by heavy air strikes approached their last hideout.
Local leaders in Sweida city said the army and militias had suffered heavy losses in weeks of attempts to advance deep into the volcanic plateau area where the rugged terrain had long made it an ideal refuge for fugitives and insurgents.
Syrian state media, quoting army sources, said they had closed in on Tulul al Safa and pro-government websites said the army had finally raised the national flag near the tomb of an revered holy figure close to the site. 
The jihadist group, which lost most of its territory in Syria last year, rampaged through Sweida city in July from the desert areas east of the city, killing more than 200 people and detonating suicide vests.
The militants are believed to have fled to other areas to the west, including the towns of al Hasa and al Rahba, with many also melting into the vast sparsely populated eastern desert region, a former rebel source familiar with the area said.
Further northeast, the U.S.-led coalition was waging air strikes against the town of Hajin, east of the Euphrates River, in the last remaining Islamic State-held pocket in Syria near the border with Iraq.

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - At least 150 Salvadorans set off on Sunday from their impoverished Central American country in a U.S.-bound caravan, ignoring their likely rejection at the U.S.-Mexico border where a larger caravan of mostly Hondurans has been stalled for days.
Guarded by police officers, the men, women and children of the gathering caravan marched through San Salvador's streets to Guatemala-bound buses, loaded with heavy backpacks, water and the knowledge of an arduous 2,700-mile (4,300-km) trek ahead to the U.S. border.
The group from El Salvador was at least the fourth caravan to set off since a first, large-scale mobilization in neighboring Honduras, which departed on Oct. 13 from the crime-wracked northern city of San Pedro Sula.
That caravan quickly grew to thousands as it moved north on daily 30-mile (50-km) treks. Many of its members were still winding their way on Sunday through Mexico toward the U.S border, where hundreds of early arrivals have been waiting since last week to cross.
Ahead of the Nov. 6 midterm U.S. congressional elections, President Donald Trump denounced the large caravan as an ""invasion"" that threatened American national security and sent thousands of active-duty U.S. troops to the border with Mexico. Trump has not publicly focused on the caravan since the election.
Inspired by the public spotlight on the larger caravan, Salvadorans organized themselves on social networks and the WhatsApp application to launch the latest effort.
Among them was Manuel Umana, a 53-year-old farmer from the town of San Pedro Masahuat, who said he decided to join Sunday's caravan to escape MS-13, a brutal criminal gang that controls large parts of El Salvador and neighboring Honduras.
""We are already threatened by the gangs where we live,"" said Umana, pointing to scars on his face he said gang members had inflicted five years ago. ""We no longer can live with these people."" 
His motives echoed dozens of migrants in the earlier caravans who told Reuters they were abandoning their homes to escape a toxic mixture of violence, corruption and economic insecurity.
El Salvador and Honduras compete for the highest homicide rates in the world, according to official figures. Both countries rank among the poorest in the Americas.
    ""It is very dangerous but we have no other alternative. We are determined to do what we need to do,"" said Umana, before leaving with the rest of the caravan from the Salvadoran capital's central Plaza Salvador del Mundo.
Far to the north on Sunday, in the city of Tijuana that abuts California, hundreds of people from the larger caravan braced for planned protests from local Mexicans both in favor and against them.
Just over the northern border, nearly 6,000 U.S. troops in recent days have stretched barbed wire to dissuade illegal entries. 
U.S. immigration authorities, meanwhile, barred passage to dozens of the migrants who in recent days formed orderly lines to enter through the San Ysidro Port of Entry connecting Mexico to San Diego.

The facelift was ordered to mark the golden jubilee of the cathedral, the official headquarters of the Coptic Church, the largest Christian denomination in the Middle East. Hundreds of engineers and artists helped renovate the cathedral, built in 1968.
The church houses more than 100 religious icons, including some drawn to commemorate Copts killed in Islamist militant attacks over the past years. The renovations were overshadowed by a 2016 suicide bombing that killed 25 people in a chapel.
Dozens of priests and altar boys in red, white and gold robes surrounded Pope Tawadros II as he led the inauguration mass, under the gleam of stained glass windows.
""This is a day of joy and the prayers are those of spiritual happiness,"" said the pope, according to state news agency MENA.
In the Dec. 11, 2016 attack, a bomber wearing an explosives belt blew himself up at a chapel used by women adjacent to the cathedral, killing 25 people and wounding 49.
No one claimed responsibility for the bombing, but Copts, who comprise about 10 percent of Egypt's nearly 100 million people, have long been targeted by Islamist militants who see them as heretics.

At least 120 Christians have been killed in attacks since 2014.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will make a televised statement on Sunday after making a last-ditch effort to avoid the collapse of a coalition government weakened by the resignation of his defense minister.
Netanyahu, head of the right-wing Likud party, has met over the past few days with coalition partners, some of whom have called for an early election. Political pundits predict a snap vote could come as soon as March, instead of November as scheduled.
Netanyahu's office said he would make a statement to reporters at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT), giving no details.
The remarks will follow a meeting between Netanyahu and his finance minister, Moshe Kahlon of the center-right Kulanu party, who has urged setting an early election date.
Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman's resignation, announced on Wednesday over what he described as the government's lenient policy towards an upsurge of cross-border violence with Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip, left the government with a majority of only one seat in parliament.
That put the fate of Netanyahu's coalition at the mercy of its partners, who have seen the four-term prime minister's popularity take a rare hit in an opinion poll that showed Israelis were unhappy with him over Gaza.
Netanyahu described his planned meeting with Kahlon as ""a last attempt to prevent the collapse of the government"".
Addressing his cabinet on Sunday, he said it would be ""unnecessary and wrong to go to an election during this sensitive period for our security"".
ROCKETS, AIR RAIDS
Kahlon said on Hadashot TV news on Saturday that it was impossible to run a coalition with control of just 61 of parliament's 120 seats.
Kahlon's call was echoed by members of the nationalist Jewish Home whose head, Naftali Bennett, asked to succeed Lieberman as defense chief but was turned down by Netanyahu on Friday.
On Sunday, Israeli media reports said Netanyahu was now prepared to offer Bennett the post in a bid to keep Jewish Home in the coalition.
Such a move, the unconfirmed reports said, would also be aimed at forcing Kahlon to consider the risks to his own party, which also courts nationalist voters, in being portrayed as the main factor behind the collapse of a rightist government.
A poll published on Wednesday by Hadashot showed Likud falling to 29 from 30 parliamentary seats after months of polls that have shown it gaining power. 
Only 17 percent of respondents were happy with Netanyahu's policy toward Gaza, where he agreed to a ceasefire - dubbed by Lieberman as ""surrender"" - after militants from its ruling Hamas group launched almost 500 rockets into Israel on Monday and Tuesday and Israel carried out dozens of air raids.
Netanyahu's re-election chances could also be affected by a series of corruption cases against him in which Israel's attorney-general is weighing his indictment.

An election would complicate promised moves by the United States toward reviving Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts that collapsed in 2014. The Trump administration has said it would unveil a peace plan soon.

985,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2018 12:14PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Rohingya repatriation, relocation plans set to be pushed back to 2019 - government official","By Zeba Siddiqui
COX'S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Bangladesh's plans to tackle the Rohingya refugee crisis are set to be stalled until the new year with repatriation and relocation programs only likely be revisited after year-end general elections, a top Bangladeshi official said on Sunday.
Abul Kalam, Bangladesh's refugee relief and repatriation commissioner, told Reuters ""a new course of action"" needed to be adopted on repatriation that took into account refugees' key demands. He later clarified these were his own personal views and not those of the government.
More than 720,000 Rohingya fled a sweeping army crackdown in Myanmar's Rakhine state in 2017, according to U.N. agencies. The crackdown was launched in response to insurgent Rohingya attacks on security forces.
Rohingya refugees say soldiers and Buddhist civilians killed families, burned many villages and carried out gang rapes. U.N-mandated investigators have accused Myanmar's army of ""genocidal intent"" and ethnic cleansing. Myanmar has denied almost all the accusations, saying its forces engaged in a counter-insurgency operation against ""terrorists"".
In late October, Bangladesh and Myanmar agreed to begin to repatriate hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslim refugees who fled, but the plan has been opposed by the Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh and the U.N. refugee agency and aid groups, who fear for the safety of Rohingya in Myanmar. 
The repatriation of the first batch of 2,200 refugees was to begin officially on Nov. 15, but it stalled amid protests at the refugee camps. None of those on the list agreed to return if their demands for justice, citizenship and the ability to go back to their original villages and lands were not met.
""I don't think anyone's agreeing to go back without these,"" said Kalam, who last week called on the international community to pressure Myanmar to accept certain ""logical and acceptable"" demands in order for any repatriation to take place.
Myanmar does not consider the Rohingya a native ethnic group and calls them ""Bengalis"", suggesting they belong in Bangladesh. It has agreed to take the Rohingya back and said they would need to accept the National Verification Card, which it says would allow Rohingya to apply for citizenship. The Rohingya reject the card, saying it brands them foreigners.
Kalam said he believed Myanmar needed to propose a ""clearer path"" to citizenship for the Rohingya if any returns were to take place, adding he would raise the matter at the next bilateral meeting on repatriation, likely to take place next month.
Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay was not reachable on Sunday for comment. 
With Bangladesh now set to go to the polls on Dec. 30, any decision either to repatriate people, or relocate refugees from the crowded camps to Bangladesh's Bhasan Char island will not proceed until 2019, Kalam said, adding later a final decision had not been taken and it would be the government's call.
""Elections are coming up now, so the government will only finalize a future course of action after the elections,"" said Kalam. 
Bangladesh has vowed not to force anyone to return and has asked the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to ensure those short-listed to return really want to go back.
A UNHCR spokesman said it was not clear when repatriations could begin. ""At this moment it's unclear, perhaps we can get clarity in the next few days.""
Some Rohingya refugee leaders in Bangladesh said they were relieved Bangladesh had not forced refugees to return and called for the repatriation plan to be revised. 
Kalam said construction work on alternative housing on Bhasan Char was ""nearly complete."" He said he was hopeful some refugees would agree to move, given the island's ""livelihood opportunities"" such as fishing and farming. Aid agencies express caution as the island is prone to flooding. 

""The possibility of refugees being relocated to the island until elections are over is slim,"" Kalam later added.

Dutch 'Black Pete' row gets violent,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - An annual pre-Christmas festival in the Netherlands this weekend was marred by scuffles and arrests as rival groups demonstrated their views on a blackface character who traditionally accompanies the arrival of St. Nicholas.
Opponents of Zwarte Piet, or Black Pete, say the custom of white people donning black face paint, red lipstick and frizzy wigs is racist. But a majority of Dutch people, with fond childhood memories of the start of the gift-giving season every Nov. 17, see it as harmless fun.
This year's celebrations came days after a court rejected an attempt by anti-racism groups to ban Black Pete from state television.
Supporters of Black Pete attacked several protesters in Rotterdam, where activists had hung a banner reading ""Black Pete is Racism"" from the city's Erasmus Bridge.
Confrontations in several other cities were prevented by police, who themselves came under attack from pro-Pete groups.
Football supporters in Eindhoven threw eggs and beer cans at police and anti-Pete protesters. Anti-Pete demonstrations in Nijmegen and Zwolle were canceled after mayors said they could not guarantee protesters' safety.
A group of 40 pro-Pete demonstrators were detained in Tilburg on Sunday as police said they were out looking for a fight. The biggest ceremony, a nationally-televised arrival in Zaanstad, went ahead without incident amid heavy security.
Justice Minister Ferdinand Grapperhaus said pro-Pete groups who had committed acts of violence would be prosecuted. There were reports of ""provocations"" but no violence by anti-Pete protesters.
""Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion,"" Grapperhaus said. ""But public disorder, throwing things - the police will always act to stop that.""
In Dutch lore, St. Nicholas travels once a year from Spain on a steamboat laden with presents, accompanied by dozens of helpers who traditionally have their faces painted black. Together, children are told, they travel the land for two weeks, handing out cookies and presents, finishing with a night of gifts and poems on Dec. 5.
In Amsterdam, St. Nicholas, ""Sinterklaas"" in Dutch, arrived on Sunday with 350 helper Petes wearing only smudges on their faces, rather than full black face paint: one variant of the story says Pete is black with soot from climbing down chimneys to deliver presents.

Macron has long championed a vision for a more integrated euro zone, including through a joint budget. 
With European Parliament elections looming next May, the French president has also urged pro-EU forces to rally and take concrete policy steps in a bid to fend off anti-immigrant, nationalist parties on the rise in several member states.
In a speech to the German lower house of parliament on Sunday at an event honoring war victims, Macron said the onus was on France and Germany to pursue those efforts.
""This new phase can be scary as we will have to share, pool together our decision-making, our policies on foreign affairs, migration and development, an increasing part of our budgets and even fiscal resources, build a common defense strategy,"" Macron said at the Bundestag.
""We have to overcome our taboos and overcome our habits.""
France and Germany are already expected to lay out plans on Monday for a limited joint euro zone budget, which will be focused for now solely on financing investment, according to French finance ministry sources.
That means it will steer clear for now of more controversial elements, like plans to use the budget to help euro zone countries in economic downturns. 
But Macron is also pushing for progress in other areas of integration, including on plans to tax internet giants which Berlin has grown hesitant on. 
CROSSROADS
Macron, who later met German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin for talks, evoked a world ""at a crossroad"" in his speech, pitting nationalist movements ""with no memory"" against more modern, progressive ones. 
""Europe, and within it, the Franco-German alliance, has the obligation not to let the world slip into chaos,"" he said. 
Macron had last week warned against the perils of nationalism at commemorations in Paris to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War One, sparking an outcry from U.S. President Donald Trump who blasted the French leader on Twitter days later.
Earlier on Sunday Macron joined Merkel and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to place wreaths at the site of the Neue Wache war memorial in Berlin. 
""You made clear with an impressive speech how important the German-Franco friendship and cooperation is, and what it role it plays in the European context,"" Merkel told Macron before their meeting at the chancellery. 
""You said we are at a crossroads ... and this is exactly what I perceive,"" she said. ""Those of us born after the war are responsible for the lessons that we learned.""

Merkel said she and Macron would discuss a wide range of issues including new tax structures for the digital age, migration and efforts to expand European defense cooperation.

The blast set nearly a dozen vehicles on fire, the police sources said. Security forces have closed most of the city streets and deployed in case of any other incidents. 
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the explosion. Such attacks have been rare in Tikrit, about 100 miles north of Baghdad, since Islamic State were defeated in Iraq in 2017.
Islamic State militants have switched from controlling territory to insurgency tactics such as bombings and attacks on security forces since their military defeat.
Analysts and security sources warn these attacks are likely to increase in traditional Sunni militant strongholds in the north and west of the country, although security in Baghdad has improved.
Iraq's government said this week that about 2,000 Iraqi Islamic State fighters based across the border in eastern Syria were seeking to come back to Iraq, and that security forces were preparing to prevent militant incursions.

In one of the art world’s most dramatic heists, thieves made off with seven paintings, worth millions of euros, by Picasso, Matisse, Monet and others.
While the Romanian ringleader and his accomplices were convicted of the theft in 2013, none of the artworks had been recovered and Romanian experts believed at least three of them had been burned in an attempt to destroy evidence.
""Anti-organized crime prosecutors are investigating the circumstances under which a painting signed by Picasso worth roughly 800,000 euros ($913,440) was found on Saturday evening in Tulcea county,"" they said in a statement, adding the painting is being authenticated.

Security camera footage released at the time of the theft showed a gang entering through a back door of the museum and disappearing from view. Seconds later they reappeared carrying bulky objects.

The other stolen works were Matisse's ""La Liseuse en Blanc et Jaune"", Monet's ""Waterloo Bridge, London"" and ""Charing Cross Bridge, London"", Gauguin's ""Femme devant une fenêtre ouverte"", Meijer De Haan's ""Autoportrait"" and Lucian Freud’s ""Woman with Eyes Closed"".

Ronald Lauder told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper that other countries, including Britain, the United States and Austria had a far better record in documenting art in their collections that had been confiscated by the Nazi regime and returning any looted pieces to their rightful owners.
The United States has extended the federal statute of limitations for seeking restitution of such art to six years from the time of ""actual discovery"" of its identity and whereabouts. Britain has put its entire collection of paintings online at Art UK, and is adding items daily, he said in an interview with the newspaper.
Germany, by contrast, was moving too slowly to digitalize art collections and research initial owners, said Lauder, who also said he was concerned about neo-Nazi marches in parts of Germany.
""One country that has done too little is Germany. Germany has a historic responsibility to do the right thing. We all know that the Holocaust had its origins there and was spread from there,"" he said.
Germany's commissioner for culture, Monika Gruetters told an audience in Israel last month that she had tripled funding for research into the ownership of so-called 'lost art' and cited what she called major progress in understanding and addressing Nazi art theft.
Lauder also said he was troubled by neo-Nazi marches and anti-Semitic slogans that had cropped up in the eastern German city of Chemnitz and the western city of Dortmund. 
""When we as Jews see these marches and hear the anti-Semitic slogans and 'Heil Hitler' calls, it reminds us of what happened on Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass) 1938,"" he said, referring to the infamous pogrom launched on Nov. 9, 1938 that eventually culminated in the killing of millions of Jews.
""It's all connected ... If Germany allows this, it sends a signal to the rest of the world that shows that Germany is not living up to its responsibilities,"" he added.
Chancellor Angela Merkel this month marked the 80th anniversary of the Nazi campaign of attacks on Jews and said Germany had a ""moral duty"" to fight anti-Semitism.
Lauder said there were four federal museums in Germany and over 5,000 other public cultural institutions that had not provided complete information about art in their collections, and he suspected many pieces remained hidden.
When his organization pressed for answers, government officials often cited procedural issues. ""Too often, those responsible in Germany hide behind the bureaucracy,"" he said.

Lauder plans to address his concerns in a speech in Berlin on Nov. 26 marking the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art, on the restitution of art confiscated by the Nazi regime in Germany before and during World War II.

YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar police shot and injured four Rohingya Muslims on Sunday, after detaining two men accused of smuggling people out of a camp for displaced people in western Rakhine state, a witness and police told Reuters. 
Some 20 police entered Ah Nauk Ye camp, about 15 km (9 miles) east of the state capital Sittwe on Sunday morning, apprehending the two men accused of owning a boat used in an attempt to smuggle 106 Rohingya out of the country on Friday. 
The rickety vessel, which carried 25 children among its passengers, had been bound for Malaysia when authorities stopped it south of Yangon, detaining those on board. The incident, and similar recent boat departures, have raised fears of a fresh wave of dangerous voyages after a 2015 regional crackdown on people smugglers. 
Maung Maung Aye, a 27-year-old Rohingya Muslim from the camp who witnessed the shooting, told Reuters four people were injured in the incident, with two of them in serious condition.
""People from the camp went out to look and police shot at people,"" he told Reuters by phone. 
Police said the Rohingya surrounded them with swords and threw stones at them, injuring some officers. 
""I heard that Bengali from the camp tried to grab the arrested people back from the police and police had to fire warning shots. I heard some Bengali got injured. I don't know the details,"" said police inspector Than Htay from a nearby police station. 
Many people in Myanmar call the Rohingya ""Bengali,"" implying they are interlopers from Bangladesh. 
Maung Maung Aye disputed that version of events. He said the Rohingya did not attack the police or try to grab the arrested men. He said police fired at residents and not into the sky. 
Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay did not answer calls seeking comment. 
Tens of thousands of Rohingya have been confined to camps outside Sittwe since violence swept Rakhine in 2012. They are denied free movement, access to decent healthcare and education. 
In August last year, Solidarites International, an international aid group, warned the conditions at Ah Nauk Ye, home to more than 4,000 Rohingya, were severe. 
It said the ""natural environment"" at the camp was ""unsuitable to human settlement"" and warned of water shortages, poor access to livelihood opportunities and communal violence.
For years, the Rohingya have boarded boats organized by smugglers in the dry months between November and March, when the sea is calm. The perilous journey to Thailand or Malaysia, often undertaken in overcrowded vessels, has cost many lives.
The 106 Rohingya detained off Yangon on Friday were put on a navy ship destined for the Rakhine camps on Sunday. 
More than 700,000 Rohingya fled a brutal army crackdown in the northern part of Rakhine last year, according to U.N. agencies. U.N. investigators have accused the Myanmar army of ""genocidal intent"" and ethnic cleansing.
Myanmar denies the allegations genocide, saying it was battling terrorists. Attacks by Rohingya insurgents preceded the army's crackdown that began in late August 2017.

998,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2018 05:03AM ET</span>","Interpol renews arrest warrant for MOL's CEO, Croatia says","ZAGREB (Reuters) - International police organization Interpol has decided to renew an arrest warrant for the head of Hungarian energy group MOL issued by Croatia, Croatian police said, while MOL on Sunday called the move surprising.
MOL Chief Executive Zsolt Hernadi has been indicted in Croatia for allegedly bribing former Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader to allow MOL to become the key decision-maker in Croatian energy company INA, in which MOL is the biggest but not the majority shareholder.
Last month Croatia began the trial of Sanader, who served as prime minister from 2003 to 2009, and Hernadi in that case. Both deny any wrongdoing. Hernadi is being tried in absentia.
Neither Interpol nor Hernadi could be immediately reached for comment.
Hungary refused to heed the international arrest warrant for Hernadi and two years ago Interpol dropped it, saying Croatia and Hungary, as European Union members, must first handle the case within the bloc. 
Croatian police said in a statement that Interpol's executive committee had on Saturday reversed its previous decision after the European Court of Justice upheld Croatia's request that the warrant be honored.
MOL said Interpol's decision was surprising as two years ago an international body for commercial arbitration ruled that evidence presented by Croatia was insufficient to prove that certain contracts made in 2009 between the Croatian government and MOL had been the result of corrupt activities.
""The decision also ignores the Hungarian court decision from August this year refusing to implement Croatia's arrest warrant on the basis that Hernadi could never have a fair trial in Croatia,"" MOL said.
Sanader was sentenced to 8-1/2 years in prison in 2014 for taking a bribe from MOL, but Croatia's Constitutional Court in 2015 ordered a retrial, citing procedural errors. 

MOL owns close to 50 percent of INA. Zagreb owns some 45 percent. The two sides have been at odds for years over management rights in INA and two years ago the Croatian government announced a plan to buy back INA shares owned by MOL.

1000,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2018 04:40AM ET</span>","Turkey says U.S. support for Syrian Kurdish YPG a ""big mistake""","ANKARA (Reuters) - The United States' support for the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia is a ""big mistake"", Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said late on Saturday, adding that the issue had strained ties between the NATO allies.
Turkey has been infuriated with Washington's support for the YPG, which it views as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) waging a decades-long insurgency on Turkish soil.
U.S.-Turkey ties have been strained over issues including U.S. policy in Syria, the case of an American pastor in Turkey, and Turkey's demands for the extradition of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara blames for a 2016 failed coup.
Cavusoglu, who is in the United States on an official visit, said tensions between Ankara and Washington stemmed from U.S. support for the YPG and the issue of Gulen, against whom he said the FBI had launched an investigation.
""Despite knowing and acknowledging that (the YPG) is the same organisation (as the PKK), seeing this cooperation as necessary is really a big mistake,"" Cavusoglu said, adding that he would discuss bilateral relations with his U.S. counterpart Mike Pompeo on Tuesday.
On Sunday, Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said he had told U.S. Chief of Staff Joseph Dunford that Turkey expected the United States to stop its support for the YPG as soon as possible, according to the state-owned Anadolu news agency.
""We reiterated our warnings and stated that we expected our U.S. counterparts to take the necessary measures and end their relationship with the YPG, which is no different than the PKK, as soon as possible,"" Akar was quoted as saying.
""We reminded them that the United States, our ally and strategic partner here (Syria), and U.S. soldiers cooperating with such an organisation (YPG) cannot be acceptable in any way,"" he said.
Tensions between the NATO allies have eased slightly in the last month following pastor Andrew Brunson's release and the beginning of joint patrols in Syria's Manbij as part of a roadmap agreed by the two countries in June.
The two countries last month also lifted mutual sanctions against top officials, imposed in response to Brunson's detention and arrest.
Earlier this month, Washington pledged millions of dollars to help capture three top PKK militants in a move that Turkey welcomed, but said was late and insufficient.
Since the attempted putsch, Turkey has jailed 77,000 people as they face trial, suspending or dismissing some 150,000 civil servants and military personnel over alleged links to Gulen.

""On both issues, we are not only a hundred percent, but a thousand percent right,"" Cavusoglu said.

It did not reveal their names, but quoted high-ranking officers leading the murder probe as saying that their investigation was at a ""very advanced stage"".
There was no immediate comment from the police on the press report.
Sources quoted by The Sunday Times of Malta gave no indication of how much longer the investigation could take or if there had been any new arrests in the case.
Caruana Galizia, who penned an anti-corruption blog, was killed by a car bomb near the Maltese capital Valletta in October 2017 - a murder that appalled Europe and raised questions about the rule of law on the Mediterranean island.
Three men suspected of having been commissioned to carry out the killing have been under arrest for almost a year. They have pleaded not guilty. 
A court documenting initial evidence against the trio has heard evidence that they allegedly planted a bomb in Caruana Galizia's car and set it off via an SMS message.
The motive behind the murder remains unknown, with the Sunday Times saying the investigators believe the masterminds had different motives and came together to contract the three men accused. 
The sources would not give any indication of whether the masterminds came from the criminal, business or political sectors.
Investigators were quoted as saying they were in constant contact with Europol – the EU’s law enforcement agency – over the case, and in recent weeks this contact intensified significantly as police got closer to cracking the case. 

""We have a large amount of data that requires analysing and partners like Europol have the necessary experience and expertise to help facilitate this process,"" a source told the newspaper.

1002,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2018 03:21AM ET</span>",North Korea's new 'tactical' weapon test highlights military modernization,"By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea's claim last week that it had tested an unidentified ""ultramodern tactical weapon"" highlighted its desire to upgrade its conventional arms and reassure its military even as talks are under way to end its nuclear program, analysts said. 
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un witnessed the test of a newly developed tactical weapon that could serve as a ""steel wall"", state media reported on Friday, without giving details of the weapon.
It was Kim's first observation of a weapons test this year and could complicate already stalled nuclear talks with the United States, although Washington and Seoul downplayed the development in an apparent effort not to derail negotiations. 
Experts say the test was part of Kim's initiative to shift the mainstay of the conventional military power from a nearly 1.3 million-strong army to high-tech weapons.
""This is sort of like the North Korean version of military reform,"" said Choi Kang, vice president of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. 
""If we have to find an underlying message to the outside world, it's 'Don't underestimate us, we are modernizing too.'""
New advanced weapons might be even more crucial if the country were to abandon at least some of its nuclear arsenal. 
Although heavily-sanctioned Pyongyang is easily outspent in defense funding by Seoul and Washington, the North's forward-deployed troops, guns and multiple-launch artillery rocket systems (MLRS) pose a significant threat to the allies. 
The North Korean military has nearly 5,500 MLRS, 4,300 tanks, 2,500 armored vehicles, 810 fighter jets, 430 combatant vessels and 70 submarines, according to a 2016 assessment by the South's defense ministry. 
The Centre for Strategic and International Studies said last week it has identified at least 13 undeclared missile bases inside North Korea.
The Washington-based think tank has also said Pyongyang has been developing hovercraft units for its 200,000-strong special forces as part of the military modernization drive. 
Kim has been pushing to modernize production lines at munitions factories and replace aging weapons and technology since he took power in late 2011. 
""The defense industry should develop and manufacture powerful strategic weapons and military hardware of our style, perfect its Juche-oriented production structure and modernize its production lines on the basis of cutting-edge science and technology,"" he said in his 2018 New Year speech, referring to the long-held principle of self-reliance. 
The two Koreas agreed during their September summit in Pyongyang to significantly reduce military tensions along the border, and the North has begun deactivating artillery deployed along the skirmish-prone western shore, Seoul's defense ministry said.
But the pact did not include any removal of MLRS from forward-deployed areas, where some long-range guns and rocket launchers can still reach Seoul. 
South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported the newly tested weapon was a new model of MLRS, citing an unnamed military source familiar with intelligence. Other experts suggested it might be a new, short-range missile. 
Kim Dong-yub, a military expert at Kyungnam University's Institute of Far Eastern Studies in Seoul, said by touting a modernized weapon, Kim could seek to reassure hard-line military generals and the public in North Korea who may be worried about a nuclear-free future. 
""With Kim having publicly declared the economy a new priority and saying the North would denuclearise, many in the military who saw a decline in interest and support could be doubtful and anxious because he has not secured significant concessions like an end-of-war declaration,"" Kim, the professor said. 

""It could have been necessary for him to consolidate the nation even though such a field guidance would give a negative signal to the outside.""

(Reuters) - Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama will stay in power for a second term as he narrowly won a general election on Sunday after voting resumed following delays due to bad weather. 
Bainimarama's Fiji First party led with about 50 percent of the votes, closely followed by nearly 40 percent for opposition Social Democratic Liberal Party (SODELPA), according to the Fiji Elections Office (FEO). 
Bainimarama, who has been the Prime Minister of Fiji since leading a bloodless coup in 2006, has won 27 of 51 seats, according to the electoral commission. 
""I'm proud to become your prime minister once again,"" Bainimarama told FBC News from Auckland, New Zealand, where he had been attending his brother's funeral. 
SODELPA, which won 21 seats, and three other losing parties urged the electoral commission and the FEO to refrain from officially announcing results, saying the tally process was not transparent. 
Fiji went to polls on Wednesday, only the second time the country has held democratic elections since 2006.
""The supervisor of elections has been in a great hurry to get the results out,"" Mahendra Chaudhry of the Fiji Labor Party said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Live video, along with SODELPA, National Federation Party and Unity Fiji. 
""He (the supervisor) has, in the process, compromised the procedures and the requirement of the law, so that should be set right if this election is to have any credibility,"" Chaudhry said. 
Elections Supervisor Mohammed Saneem said in response that the authorities had been open. 
""The people of Fiji deserve better in terms of information. And the Fiji Elections Office is giving all the information accurately in a timely manner,"" Saneem said, also on Facebook Live. 
Endorsing Saneem's claims, election monitoring body Multinational Observer Group (MOG) said in a short interim statement on Friday that the Fijian election campaign was conducted according to international standards. 
""We understand that there are some members of the public who have concerns about the integrity of the pre-poll ballots, and therefore we recognised the need to look closely at this process,"" it said. 
""The MOG assesses that the legal framework underpinning the electoral system complies with the fundamental international principles of universal suffrage and non-discrimination.""

Earlier in the week, heavy rain disrupted the election in some venues. Voting in those places was rescheduled to Saturday, Nov. 17, to ensure all eligible votes were counted.

1004,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2018 12:36AM ET</span>","Search on for 1,276 now missing after California's deadliest wildfire","By Terray Sylvester and Steve Holland
PARADISE, Calif. (Reuters) - The number of people missing after California's deadliest and most destructive wildfire jumped on Saturday to 1,276, despite authorities locating hundreds of people who scattered when the Camp Fire tore through the mountain town of Paradise.
Forensic recovery teams sifting through the charred wreckage recovered the remains of five more victims, bringing the death toll to at least 76, authorities said. Sixty-three of them have been tentatively identified, pending DNA confirmation.
Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said much of the increase in the number of missing was due to his office's efforts to comb through a backlog of emergency calls that came in during the first hours of the fire on Nov. 8.
He said officials were sifting through the list of missing persons for duplications and people who fled. Some 380 people had been located and taken off the list since Friday, he said.
""A lot of progress is being made with regard to that, but this is still raw data,"" Honea told a news conference.
The sheriff spoke after President Donald Trump visited Paradise, the small community that was home to nearly 27,000 people in the Sierra foothills, 175 miles (280 km) north of San Francisco, before being all but consumed by the blaze.
""Nobody could have thought this would ever happen,"" Trump told reporters amid the charred wreckage of the town's Skyway Villa Mobile Home and RV Park.
""This is very sad to see. As far as the lives are concerned, nobody knows quite yet,"" Trump said. ""Right now we want to take care of the people who have been so badly hurt.""
Trump was flanked by California Governor Jerry Brown and Governor-elect Gavin Newsom. Brown said the federal government was doing what it needed to do, including supporting first responders and helping with clean-up and search for victims.
The disaster already ranks among the deadliest U.S. wildfires since the turn of the last century. Eighty-seven people perished in the Big Burn firestorm that swept the Northern Rockies in August 1910. Minnesota's Cloquet Fire in October 1918 killed 450 people.
Trump has blamed the recent spate of fires on forest mismanagement, and he said he discussed the issue with Brown and Newsom on the ride into Paradise.
Asked whether the scenes of devastation had changed his view on climate change, Trump said: ""No. I have a strong opinion. I want great climate and we're going to have that and we're going to have forests that are very safe.""
Authorities attribute the high death toll from the blaze - dubbed ""Camp Fire"" - partly to the speed with which flames raced through the town with little warning, driven by howling winds and fueled by drought-desiccated scrub and trees.
More than a week later, firefighters have managed to carve containment lines around 55 percent of the blaze's perimeter.
Besides the toll on human life, property losses from the blaze make it the most destructive in California history, posing the additional challenge of providing long-term shelter for many thousands of displaced residents.
EVACUEES
With more than 12,700 homes and other structures up in smoke, many refugees have taken up temporary residence with friends and family, while others have pitched tents or were living out of their vehicles.
Hundreds of evacuees were being housed in 14 emergency shelters set up in churches, schools and community centers around the region, with more than 46,000 people remaining under evacuation orders, authorities said.
Several shelters are full and although authorities say they still have space for everyone, hundreds of people have been camping in tents and cars in the area.
LIST OF THE MISSING
The names were being compiled from information received from a special hotline, along with email reports and a review of emergency 911 calls that came in on the first night of the fire, Honea said.
Some listed have likely survived but not yet notified family or authorities. Others may not have been immediately listed because of delays in reporting them.
Honea bristled at a Friday press conference when asked whether many of those listed, more than a week after the disaster, were expected at this point to end up either deceased or declared missing and presumed dead.
 ""I don't think it's appropriate for any of us to sit and speculate about what the future holds,"" he said.
The sheriff on Saturday emphasized that authorities were largely relying on the public's cooperation to determine who on the list of missing persons is alive.
""I want to tell people that it’s really very important for you to take a look at the list and call us if you’re on the list and let us know.""
Weather conditions have since turned more in the firefighters' favor, though strong, gusty winds and lower humidity were expected through early Sunday ahead of rain forecast for mid-week.
The outbreak of Camp Fire coincided with a series of smaller blazes in Southern (NYSE:SO) California, most notably the Woolsey Fire, which is linked to three fatalities near the Malibu coast west of Los Angeles.
Scientists have said the growing frequency and intensity of wildfires in California and elsewhere across the West are largely attributable to prolonged drought that is symptomatic of climate change.

The precise causes of the Camp and Woolsey Fires were under investigation, but electric utilities have reported equipment problems in the vicinity of both blazes around the time they erupted.

MEXICALI, Mexico (Reuters) - Hundreds of migrants from a caravan of Central Americans were stalled at the U.S.-Mexico border on Saturday, where a handful said they welcomed recent Mexican offers of employment in the face of a hostile U.S. reception.
The Mexican government last week reiterated job offers to the migrants, saying that those who obtained legal status could occupy thousands of vacancies, most of them in the country's ""maquiladoras,"" doing factory work.
Since arriving at the border last week, they have been denied entry through the gates linking Mexico to the United States. 
Dozens of the mostly Hondurans waited in lines to bathe and washed clothes sullied from 2,600 miles of relentless travel.
Several members of the caravan, which left the crime-wracked city of San Pedro Sula, Honduras, on Oct. 13, told Reuters they would be willing to stay put in Mexico rather than face rejection across the border.
""If we had work, we would stay. This has been very tiring,"" said Orbelina Orellana, a 26-year-old Honduran mother of three, waiting at the Alfa and Omega shelter in the city of Mexicali, which borders Calexico, California. 
""I cry a lot to not be able to feed them as I'd like,"" Orellana said of her children. ""I just want an opportunity.""
Briefly stalled by Mexican riot police on a highway crossing between two southern Mexican states late last month, a dozen migrants told Reuters they rejected such offers, preferring to try their luck in the United States.
But on Saturday, some said that thinking had changed.
""We had the idea to cross to the United States, but they told us it will be nearly impossible,"" said Mayra Gonzalez, 32, traveling with her two children. ""We cannot starve as we wait to find out if they'll give us asylum. Better to work, by the grace of God, here in Mexico.""
In a sharp reversal of longstanding U.S. policy, President Donald Trump's administration last week began enforcing new rules that curtail asylum rights for anyone who arrives without documents at the U.S. border.
Trump earlier this month deployed almost 6,000 troops along the long U.S. border with Mexico.
    As they wound north through Mexico, the migrants were helped along by local authorities and residents who offered food, clothing and even free rides on daily treks that averaged 30 miles a day, much of it on foot.
But that welcome became noticeably frostier as the caravan reached the border.
In Tijuana, a city long accustomed to a population of migrants in transit, deportees and U.S. pleasure-seekers, a clutch of local residents last week threw rocks at the migrants, telling them to go home. 
But some said the Central Americans could help boost the local economy.
""We are not against migration,"" Ulises Araiza, President of the Association of Human Resources of Industry in Tijuana, told Reuters. 

""We know the situation that these people face in their country. But we also favor order so as to integrate them into the labor sector, because only in Tijuana do we have a demand in the maquiladora industry for 5,000 people.""

Asked about reports of air strikes in the Buqan area near Hajin on the eastern banks of the Euphrates River on Saturday, the coalitio’s spokesman confirmed that there were strikes but denied there were civilian casualties.
Colonel Sean Ryan, the coalition spokesman, said ""the coalition takes great measures to identify and strike appropriate ISIS targets in order to avoid non-combatant casualties.""
Islamic State's Amaq news agency quoted a medical source as saying 40 people had been killed, a claim which was also made by Syrian state media.
Relatives of families from the area and Syrian state media

The Syrian government protested just over a week ago to the United Nations about an air strike by the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State which it said killed 26 civilians in Hajin.
The fighting is the latest phase of efforts by the U.S.-led coalition and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to clear Islamic State from its last foothold east of the Euphrates River following last year's defeat of the group in Raqqa, its Syrian headquarters.

1008,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2018 04:58PM ET</span>",Trump administration says no final conclusion on Khashoggi murder,"By Pete Schroeder, Jan Wolfe and Steve Holland
WASHINGTON/Paradise, California (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Saturday said it had not reached a final conclusion on who was involved in the death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi despite a U.S. Central Intelligence Agency assessment that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing.
""Recent reports indicating that the U.S. government has made a final conclusion are inaccurate,"" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement. ""There remain numerous unanswered questions with respect to the murder of Mr. Khashoggi.""
Nauert said the State Department will continue to seek facts and work with other countries to hold those involved in the journalist's killing accountable ""while maintaining the important strategic relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia."" 
Trump, while flying to California on Saturday, discussed the CIA assessment by phone with the agency's director, Gina Haspel, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters.
The CIA had briefed other parts of the U.S. government, including Congress, on its assessment, sources told Reuters on Friday, a development that complicates Trump's efforts to preserve ties with the key U.S. ally.
A source familiar with the CIA's assessment said it was based largely on circumstantial evidence relating to the prince's central role in running the Saudi government. 
The CIA's finding is the most definitive U.S. assessment to date tying Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler directly to the killing and contradicts Saudi government assertions that Prince Mohammed was not involved. 
Khashoggi, a U.S.-based Washington Post columnist and critic of the crown prince, was killed in October at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul when he went there to pick up documents he needed for his planned marriage.
As lawmakers push legislation to punish Saudi Arabia for the killing, both Republican and Democratic senators on Saturday urged Trump to be tough on the crown prince, with whom he has cultivated a deep personal relationship. 
""Everything points to the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, MbS, ordering @washingtonpost journalist Jamal #Khashoggi's killing. The Trump administration should make a credible determination of responsibility before MbS executes the men who apparently carried out his orders,"" tweeted Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on Saturday.
Trump and top administration officials have said Saudi Arabia should be held to account for any involvement in Khashoggi's death and have imposed sanctions on 17 Saudis for their role in the killing.
But they have also stressed the importance of Washington's ties with Riyadh, one of the biggest clients of the U.S. defense industry. Trump wants to preserve the Saudi arms deals, despite growing opposition in Congress.
""They have been a truly spectacular ally in terms of jobs and economic development,"" Trump said. ""As president, I have to take a lot of things into consideration.""
Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, noted on Saturday that the kingdom plays a key military role for the United States in the Middle East.
""Saudi Arabia has been an important partner to regional security in the past, I expect they will be in the future,"" he said at a security forum in Halifax, adding Middle Eastern allies including Saudi Arabia are ""a stabilizing force in the region.""
On Thursday, Saudi Arabia’s public prosecutor said he was seeking the death penalty for five suspects charged in the killing of Khashoggi. 
The prosecutor, Shaalan al-Shaalan, told reporters the crown prince knew nothing of the operation, in which Khashoggi’s body was dismembered and removed from the consulate. Saudi officials have said a team of 15 Saudi nationals were sent to confront Khashoggi and he was accidentally killed in a chokehold by men who were trying to force him to return to the kingdom.
Lawmakers critical of Saudi Arabia for Khashoggi's killing and its role in Yemen's civil war are ramping up their efforts to clamp down on the country.

""Trump must accept (for once) his intelligence experts’ incontrovertible conclusion: Crown Prince MBS is culpable for Khashoggi’s monstrous murder. This brazen killing must have consequences — sanctions, prosecution, removal of MBS & others, not continued cover-up, enabled by Trump,"" tweeted Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal on Saturday.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Syrian rebels said on Saturday the Syrian army and their allies were intensifying attacks on a demilitarised zone in the northwest in an attempt to undermine a Russian-Turkish deal that has averted a major offensive on their last stronghold.
They said the army has stepped up its onslaught with hundreds of mortar and rocket attacks on a string of rebel-held villages and towns in northern Hama, southern Idlib and Latakia that fall within a demilitarized zone agreed last September between Russia and Turkey.
""The regime has targeted all the fronts in the demilitarised zone. We have responded by striking at their military posts that have struck populated villages and towns,"" said Captain Naji Abu Huthaifa, a spokesman for the National Liberation Front, an alliance of Turkish-backed rebels.
Russia and Turkey reached a deal in Sochi last September to enforce a demilitarised zone in Idlib and adjacent areas that are the last stronghold of rebels who rose against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011.
Idlib province is also home to an estimated 3 million people, more than half of whom have already been displaced at least once during the war. 
The Syrian army and allied militias had wanted to press on to regain the last of the rebel held areas after recapturing southern Syria and ending insurgent control around the capital. 
Syrian state media, quoting army sources, blamed rebels for the attacks and accused them of trying to wreck the Russian-Turkish initiative.
Under the deal Turkey had pledged to drive out al Qaeda-inspired jihadists from the zone, but Russian military is increasingly questioning Ankara's ability to implement it.
The main jihadist group, Tahrir al Sham, has so far not withdrawn heavy weapons, a regional intelligence source said on Saturday.
A suicide attack by the Ansar al Islam militant group on an army checkpoint on Friday had killed at least twenty three soldiers, rebels said. 
But despite flareup in violence, the Russian and Syrian airforce have so far not resumed aerial bombing since the deal.
The attacks have also forced hundreds of families that had earlier been encouraged to return to some of the frontline villages in the zone to flee further north near the Turkish border, residents said.

Hundreds of people protested near Westminster, carrying banners with messages including ""Stop Climate Breakdown"", ""Fossil Fuel Era Over"" and ""Rebel For Life"".
""This is an act of mass civil disobedience. This is the start of an international rebellion protesting the lack of action on the ecological crisis,"" one organizer, Gail Bradbrook, told reporters.
Police said demonstrators had mostly been arrested for obstructing the road, and had no immediate information on charges or the total number of protesters.
Organizers said more than 6,000 people had been involved.
""The demonstration is having a direct impact on others across London who wish to go about their daily business - and (stopped) the emergency services from using the bridges to travel around London,"" police superintendent Waheed Khan said just before the bridges reopened.
Britain reduced greenhouse gas emissions by over 40 percent between 1990 and 2016, and the government has committed to a total reduction of 80 percent by 2050.

The Extinction Rebellion campaigners are calling for emissions to be reduced to zero on a net basis by 2025.

More than 10,000 demonstrators marched peacefully through the center of Athens, which was heavily guarded by police. 
They held banners reading ""Resistance"" and chanted slogans related to Greece's eight-year debt crisis that led to three international bailouts in exchange for deep austerity cuts. 
The procession ended at the embassy of the United States, which many Greeks accuse of having supported the 1967-1974 seven-year military dictatorship.
After the march ended, clashes broke out between police and protesters hurling stones and petrol bombs at them in the district of Exarchia, home to Athens Polytechnic, where dozens died in 1973.
Greek TV station Alpha showed images of police firing tear gas at demonstrators locked in the Polytechnic. Other protesters built street barricades with chairs or threw petrol bombs from rooftops. Police deployed a water cannon to disperse the crowd.

Earlier, many people laid wreaths and carnations at the Athens Polytechnic to honor those killed in the 1973 revolt.

PRAGUE (Reuters) - Thousands of Czechs called for Prime Minister Andrej Babis to resign on Saturday, in protests coinciding with the anniversary of the ""Velvet Revolution"" that toppled Communism in the former Soviet-bloc state.
Babis has denied accusations he hindered a fraud investigation and says he will not resign.
A junior government coalition party has been weighing whether to leave the cabinet after Babis' son was recorded saying his father wanted him to hide last year to avoid police questioning.
The protests came two days after similar demonstrations calling for the billionaire businessman to resign. On Saturday the protests were mixed with celebrations observing the 1989 revolution that toppled the Communist government in then Czechoslovakia.
Protesters filled Wenceslas Square (NYSE:SQ) and the city's Old Town Square, some chanting ""Resign!"" and carrying signs saying ""We don't want a prosecuted PM."" 
Many lit candles to commemorate the Velvet Revolution and bands played throughout the city center.
Opposition parties have called a vote of no confidence in Babis's cabinet, which is expected to be held next Friday.
The centre-left Social Democrats, a government partner of Babis's ANO party, are considering whether to withdraw support, although a party source said a number of its lawmakers were leaning toward staying. 
Babis won support from President Milos Zeman who said late on Thursday he expected the situation to calm down. He said in a television interview he would give Babis another chance to form a cabinet if the confidence vote forced him to resign.
Police charged Babis and two of his children last year with fraud, saying they had manipulated ownership of one of Babis's firms a decade ago so it would qualify for 2 million euros ($2.3 million) in public aid.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday he wanted his government to fulfil its term, putting the onus of triggering an expected early election onto a coalition partner.
Netanyahu has faced calls from his coalition members to hold a snap election after the resignation of Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman on Wednesday.
Lieberman quit over what he described as the government's too-soft policy on an upsurge of cross-border violence with Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip, leaving the government with a razor-thin majority.
Israel's Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon, who heads the centrist Kulanu party, was the first coalition partner to call for an early election after meeting Netanyahu on Thursday.
Kahlon's calls were echoed by Aryeh Deri, head of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party and by members of the nationalist Jewish Home whose head, Naftali Bennett, asked to succeed Lieberman as defense chief but was turned down by Netanyahu on Friday.
The loss of Lieberman's Israel Beitenu faction leaves Netanyahu with control of just 61 of the 120 seats in parliament. Each of the remaining government factions now has the power to effectively dissolve the coalition. 
Netanyahu, who heads the right-wing Likud party said that he will meet Kahlon on Sunday ""in a last attempt to convince him not to bring down the government."" 
""If the Kulanu faction doesn't bring the government down - there is a government,"" Netanyahu said on Twitter. ""All Likud members want to keep serving the country for another whole year until the end of the term in November 2019."" 
""That kind of spin doesn't work on me,"" Kahlon said in response on Hadashot television news. ""It's impossible to run a coalition with sixty-one Knesset members.
Analysts see an early election as a done deal, with Netanyahu and ministers trying to pin responsibility for bringing the government down on each other so as not to lose favor with their right-wing voter base.
""We're heading for an election - there is no government,"" Bennett told Israel's Meet the Press on Saturday. ""There's a blame-game being fought on who will be the one to pronounce it dead."" 
Netanyahu is under investigation in a series of corruption cases, and there has been speculation that he may bring the ballot forward to win a renewed mandate while Israel's attorney-general decides whether to indict him.
Both Lieberman and Bennett compete with Netanyahu's Likud for right-wing voters and have spoken in favor of harsh Israeli military action against Gaza's dominant Hamas Islamists.

A poll published on Wednesday by Hadashot showed Likud falling by one seat from 30 to 29 after months of polls that have shown it gaining power. Only 17 percent of respondents were happy with Netanyahu's Gaza policy.

British Prime Minister Theresa May is fighting to save the draft withdrawal deal ahead of a vote in parliament after ministerial resignations and open talk of a challenge to her leadership followed its endorsement by cabinet. 
British media reported on Friday that pro-Brexit ministers, including trade minister Liam Fox and environment minister Michael Gove, the most prominent Brexiteer in May's government, would meet this weekend to modify her deal.
Ireland has been among the EU governments that have said there was little scope to change the proposals.
Coveney said on Saturday that the withdrawal treaty would not be reopened and suggested that wavering British ministers instead seek to influence the political declaration on future relations still under discussion.
""This idea that now after two years of negotiation, somehow four or five cabinet ministers can negotiate a different outcome and agree it themselves, and then expect the EU to just sign up to that, I just think it's not living in the real world,"" Coveney told a podcast recorded by the Irish Times at his Fine Gael party's annual conference. 
The legally-binding withdrawal treaty forms part of a Brexit package alongside the declaration, which envoys from the other EU member states met to discuss in Brussels on Friday ahead of a Nov. 25 summit for EU heads to rubber-stamp both documents.
Diplomats and officials involved in Friday's meeting told Reuters that EU states said they wanted an ""ambitious"" future relationship with Britain but that this would not mean frictionless trade.
Coveney said talks in the coming days on the declaration provided British ministers with the opportunity to get the reassurances they need on future EU-British trade.

""The negotiating team has deliberately decided to publish a skeleton document that needs to be fleshed out and will probably double or quadruple in size by the time it's done,"" he said, adding that it was ""absolutely"" up for discussion with London.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish authorities released eight people who were detained on Friday under an investigation into jailed rights activist Osman Kavala and accused of following him in a bid to unseat the government through mass protests in 2013, their lawyers said.
Police have said the 13 people detained on Friday, including two prominent academics, were accused of working with Kavala to incite the May 2013 unrest, which began as demonstrations against urban development plans at Istanbul's Gezi Park but later turned into nationwide anti-government protests.
Lawyers for the detainees told Reuters on Saturday that six had been released after being questioned by the police late on Friday and another two were released on Saturday, but all were banned from travel. 
Three people were still giving testimonies to the police and another two were sent to the court on arrest orders, they said.
Among those released were Turgut Tarhanli, dean of Istanbul Bilgi University's law faculty, Betul Tanbay of the Bogazici University, who was elected this year as vice president of the European Mathematical Society, and staff members of Kavala's Anadolu Kultur organization, the lawyers said.
Turkish police did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Kavala, a well-known civil society leader, was jailed a year ago pending trial for trying to overthrow the government, in a process authorities say started with the Gezi demonstrations and culminated with an attempted coup in July 2016.
At the time, the Gezi demonstrations, in which at least 10 people died and thousands were injured in a government crackdown, were the biggest ever staged against the government of Tayyip Erdogan, now president, then entering his second decade as prime minister.
Human rights groups and European Parliament members have repeatedly called on NATO member Turkey to release Kavala. An indictment against him has not been issued.
The European Union and the United States have also called for the release of the detainees.
Since a July 2016 attempted putsch, Turkey has jailed 77,000 people as they face trial, suspending or dismissing some 150,000 civil servants and military personnel and shutting down dozens of media outlets.
Police still frequently carry out operations targeting the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara accuses of orchestrating the abortive coup.

ANTANANARIVO (Reuters) - Former presidents Andry Rajoelina and Marc Ravalomanana won most votes in Madagascar's presidential election, according to provisional results issued on Saturday that pointed to a likely second round.
Rajoelina led with 39.19 percent of the vote followed by Ravalomanana with 35.29 percent. The incumbent President Hery Rajaonarimampianina, seeking a second term in office, was a distant third with about 9 percent. 
A total of 36 candidates ran for president. Turnout was 54.23 percent, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) said.
The final results will be announced in nine days by the constitutional court and if no candidate has a majority the top two will compete in a second round on Dec. 19. 
Voters are eager for a leader who will tackle the impoverished Indian Ocean island's many problems including unemployment and corruption.

Madagascar is hoping for the second peaceful election since upheaval in 2009 when Ravalomanana was forced out of office by protests led by Rajoelina in what international organisations such as the African Union said was a coup.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - The Argentine Navy submarine that went missing a year ago off the country's Atlantic Coast was found by a private company involved in what had been a massive search for the vessel and its 44-member crew, the defense ministry said in a news conference on Saturday.
The ARA San Juan submarine was discovered by marine tracking contractor Ocean Infinity, 907 meters (2,975 feet) below the ocean surface. The vessel was found in an underwater canyon with its tail partially ""imploded,"" Argentina's Defense Minister Carlos Aguad said.
Given the poor visibility at the site, the ministry said it only had preliminary information about the state of the submarine, which was scattered in pieces on the ocean floor.
Aguad could neither confirm nor deny if the vessel could be recovered, but said the government did ""not have the means to extract the submarine.""
The disappearance gripped the nation's attention as the government struggled to provide information about the tragedy. Relatives of the crew still have questions.
""We have found them,"" Jorge Villarreal, father of one crew member told local radio. ""Now we are going to search for the truth. For us this is the start of a new chapter.""
Aguad said: ""Much of what happens from here will have to be resolved by the justice department. If there is someone responsible, they will be held responsible."" 
At the time of the disappearance, the Navy said water that had entered the submarine's snorkel caused its battery to short-circuit. 
Naval officials said international organizations helping to search for the missing vessel a year ago detected a noise that could have been the submarine imploding, just two hours after its last contact.
The first anniversary of the submarine's disappearance was commemorated at the Mar del Plata naval base on Nov. 15, with President Mauricio Macri in attendance. 
The crew had been ordered to return to Mar del Plata on the country's east coast. But the vessel was never heard from again.
AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLES
Ocean Infinity, a U.S. company that can search and map the seabed, was hired by Argentina following the failure of an international operation to find the vessel after it went missing in the South Atlantic. 
Ocean Infinity used five autonomous underwater vehicles to carry out the search, according to a statement from the company.
""Our thoughts are with the many families affected by this terrible tragedy. We sincerely hope that locating the resting place of the ARA San will be of some comfort to them,"" the statement said.
The San Juan was some 430 km (270 miles) off Argentina's Patagonian coast when it sent its last signal. 
The disaster spurred soul-searching over the state of the military in Argentina, which after a series of financial crises has one of Latin America's smallest defense budgets relative to the size of its economy. Some families of missing crew members blamed the government for underfunding the Navy.
Argentina learned a harsh lesson of submarines' military value during the 1982 Falklands War, when a British sub sank the ARA General Belgrano cruiser. It was the only major ship Argentina lost in the war over the disputed Falkland Islands, which Argentina calls the Malvinas.

A new poll conducted for public broadcaster ARD showed 46 percent of CDU supporters backed Kramp-Karrenbauer for the post, compared to 31 percent for businessman Friedrich Merz and 12 percent for Health Minister Jens Spahn. 
Among women, support for Merz dropped to around half the level achieved by Kramp-Karrenbauer, ARD said. 
The number of women CDU lawmakers fell in the 2017 elections to one-fifth of the party's parliamentarians, and better representation of women is essential to shore up the party's support in future elections, Kramp-Karrenbauer said.
She told broadcaster Suedwestrundfunk (SWR) that many in the party had failed to take seriously a 1996 CDU rule reserving a third of party list candidates for women and said she would try to enforce the rule if elected leader.
She said she would also consider legal measures to ensure better representation of women in Germany's parliament.
New legislation to adopt a female quota was ""a last resort"", she said. ""But it would be naive to think we can just let the issue run its course.""
In another interview with Der Spiegel magazine, Kramp-Karrenbauer also took aim at dual citizenship rules, accusing Turkey's leadership of trying to split the loyalties of German-Turkish dual nationals living in Germany.
""If that continues, then dual citizenship is missing its sense and purpose, and we must talk about how we end this system,"" she said.
The former premier of the western state of Saarland, said she supported a plan under which the children of immigrants received a second passport, but their children would not.
The CDU voted in 2016 to end dual citizenship, but Chancellor Merkel subsequently said she did not feel bound by the vote.

Merkel, now in her fourth term, has said she will step down as leader of her Christian Democrats, but plans to remain chancellor through 2021.

MALE (Reuters) - The new president of the Maldives took office on Saturday, declaring the state coffers to have been looted and warned that the country was in financial difficulty after racking up debt with Chinese lenders in an infrastructure boom.
The Maldives, famous for its luxury resorts on palm-fringed islands, is the latest in a number of small countries where China has invested millions of dollars building highways and housing as part of its Belt and Road Initiative. 
But these projects have left the country of just over 400,000 people in debt and prompted calls for investigations into how contracts were awarded to Chinese companies during the previous administration. 
""As I take over the presidency, the state's financial situation is precarious. The damage done due to projects conducted only for political reasons, and at a loss, are huge,"" said Ibrahim Mohamed Solih in a speech soon after he was sworn in as president. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, which is seeking to claw back ground in a country it considered as part of its area of influence, was the highest ranking foreign visitor at the ceremony held in a soccer stadium in the capital Male. 
Solih, a veteran lawmaker, won the presidential election in September as a joint opposition candidate against president Abdullah Yameen, a strongman who steered the country closer to China and faced international pressure over imprisoning political rivals.
""The state coffers have lost several billions of rufiyaa (local currency) due to embezzlement and corruption conducted at different levels of the government,"" Solih said.
He said it wasn't clear how much the state had lost. His transition team said this week it would conduct a forensic audit of deals sealed by the Yameen administration, many of them with Chinese state firms. 
The big worry for Solih's team is the debt the country has run up with Chinese lenders for projects such as a mile-long sea bridge connecting the airport to the capital, the airport expansion itself and massive housing projects on reclaimed islands. 
Solih's transition team said it had been told the country owed $1.5 billion to Chinese lenders, but fear it could be much higher. Even a debt of $1.5 billion would be more than a quarter of the country's annual gross domestic product.
Modi told Solih that India stood ready to help the Maldives through its economic difficulties, the Indian foreign ministry said in a statement following their meeting.
India, which has long been the Maldives' main political and economic partner, had grown concerned that China's expansive diplomacy was aimed at establishing an outpost on the islands.
China has already gained a strong foothold in Sri Lanka, just off the southern coast of India, where it has a built a port and now controls it in a debt-for-equity swap.
Modi and Solih agreed the two countries would be mindful of each other’s concerns and the need for stability in the Indian Ocean, the Indian foreign ministry said in the statement. 
China has said it hoped there would be continuity in policies during Solih's presidency and it would create good conditions for Chinese firms.

OSLO (Reuters) - Thousands of protesters demonstrated in Norwegian cities on Saturday against restricting women's access to abortion, the subject of talks between the ruling minority coalition and a small party seeking to join the government.
In Norway's capital Oslo, the demonstrators, some pushing children in strollers, marched through the city center carrying banners with slogans such as ""My body my right"" and ""Defend abortion"".
""The new law that's proposed is limiting women's rights,"" said Ine Lund, a 22-year-old criminology student. ""I feel it should be up to the woman to choose."" 
When the Christian Democrats opened talks on teaming up with the opposition Labour Party to bring down the Conservative-led government, Prime Minister Erna Solberg intervened, offering to discuss tightening abortion rules.
The argument helped persuade rank-and-file members of the socially conservative, Lutheran-based party to vote for talks to join the ruling coalition, potentially securing Solberg a majority in parliament until the next election in 2021.
The Christian Democrats want further restrictions or an end to terminations after the twelfth week of pregnancy, potentially reining in exemptions for genetic conditions or injuries.
The party also wants to make it more difficult, or stop altogether, selective abortions in multi-fetal pregnancies.
""It is discriminating to select on the basis of having different skills ... Children with Down syndrome should have the same legal rights as other children,"" Kjell Ingolf Ropstad, deputy leader of the Christian Democrats, told public broadcaster NRK earlier this month.
Since 1978, a termination after 12 weeks must be authorized by a panel of two hospital doctors. If the panel refuses, the decision can be appealed.
In an effort to quell a backlash within her own party, as well as from the opposition, Solberg said any changes to the abortion law would not undermine women's rights.
""In practice this will mean that, in future, women who seek an abortion after the twelfth week of pregnancy will as much as before have the right to have an abortion,"" she told parliament on Wednesday.

Some 68 percent of Norwegians are against changing the abortion law, while 16 percent are in favor, according to a poll published in daily VG on Nov. 9. The phone survey by Respons Analyse polled 1,000 participants aged 18 and over.

Varadkar's Fine Gael party and the main opposition group backing his minority government began talks on whether to renew their ""confidence and supply"" deal three weeks ago. His deputy leader said on Friday the agreement had a few more weeks to run. 
Varadkar insists that he wants to extend the pact until mid-2020, rather than capitalize on his Fine Gael party's increased popularity by calling an immediate snap election.
The option of calling an election has also been complicated by the uncertainty over how neighboring Britain will leave the EU.
On Saturday he spelled out that he would not like to see parliament dissolved before the passing of key legislation by Christmas.
The legislation includes the Termination of Pregnancy Bill, which will introduce abortion services in Ireland following the historic referendum in May to overhaul one of the world's most restrictive regimes.
""I don't have any plans to dissolve the Dail (parliament) this side of Christmas but it's not entirely in my hands,"" Varadkar told reporters at Fine Gael's annual conference, noting that his partners in opposition could also pull their support.

Trump has sought closer ties with Saudi Arabia, citing Riyadh's role in countering Iranian influence in the region, and billions of dollars in potential arms deals.

Rouhani's remarks, made after a meeting with visiting Iraqi President Barham Salih, came about two weeks after the United States restored sanctions targeting Iran’s key oil industry as well as its banking and transportation sectors. 
""... through bilateral efforts, we can raise this figure (for bilateral trade) to $20 billion in the near future,"" Rouhani said in comments broadcast live on Iranian state television.
""We held talks on trade in electricity, gas, petroleum products and activities ... in the field of oil exploration and extraction,"" Rouhani said. 
Iraqi officials told Reuters last week that Iraq had agreed to sell foodstuffs in return for Iranian gas and energy supplies. 
Iranian trade officials denied that any food-for-gas scheme could be set up as Iran was a net exporter of food to Iraq.
""The opposite is correct, since Iran provides foodstuffs to Iraq... We have exported more than $6 billion to Iraq in the past seven months and we could import goods for that amount but not food items,"" Yahya Al-e Eshaq, head of the Iran-Iraq chamber of commerce, was quoted as saying by the ILNA news agency.
A spokesman for an association of Iranian gas and petrochemicals exporters said Iraq wanted to pay for the gas imports in its dinar currency, the semi-official ISNA news agency reported.
U.S. APPROVAL SOUGHT
Baghdad is seeking U.S. approval to allow it to import Iranian gas for its power stations. Iraqi officials say they needs more time to find an alternative source than a 45-day waiver granted to it by the United States. 
""It will be important to create free trade zones at our shared border and to connect the two countries' railways,"" Salih said.
""We will not forget your support for the Iraqi people in the fight against (Iraqi dictator) Saddam (Hussein). Neither do we forget Iran's stand in the recent fight against terrorism,"" added Salih, an Iraqi Kurd.
Iran wields wide influence in Iraq, its smaller Arab neighbor, where its Revolutionary Guards played a key role in training and arming the mainly Shi’ite militias that helped defeat Islamic State. 
Iraq imports a wide range of goods from Iran, including food, agricultural products, home appliances, air conditioners and spare car parts. The goods element of Iranian imports to Iraq was worth about $6 billion in the 12 months ending March 2018, or about 15 percent of Iraq’s total imports for 2017.
Energy contracts also contribute to the total volume of bilateral trade.

Iraqi central bank officials said in August that their country’s economy was closely linked to non-Arab Iran, which is engaged in several proxy wars with Saudi Arabia in the region.

Xi told South Korean president Moon Jae-in in a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) summit in Papua New Guinea that he would ""make time"" to visit North Korea next year. 
Xi added that China would continue to play a constructive role in building peace on the Korean peninsula, Kim Eui-kyeom, spokesman for South Korea's presidential office, said at a briefing after the meeting between Xi and Moon. 
This comes at a time when negotiations between North Korea and the United States appear to have stalled over how to remove the Pyongyang's nuclear weapons. 
At an unprecedented summit in Singapore, U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim agreed in June to work toward denuclearization and peace on the Korean peninsula and establish new relations. But the agreement was short on specifics, and negotiations have made little headway since. 
Xi's trip to North Korea would be the first by a Chinese president since his predecessor Hu Jintao's visit in 2005. Xi traveled to North Korea in 2008 as a vice president. 
Amid existing international sanctions on North Korea following its weapons tests, China is Pyongyang's sole major ally and a key economic lifeline for the isolated country. 
China appears to have relaxed enforcement of sanctions on Pyongyang, as relations between China and North Korea have thawed after the long-time ally of Beijing began to engage with the United States this year, a U.S. congressional commission said earlier this week. 
China's account of the bilateral meeting in Papua New Guinea made no mention of Xi planning to go to North Korea. 
Xi said that in the past year, the situation on the Korean Peninsula had undergone positive changes returning to the ""correct track"" of talks, according to a Chinese foreign ministry statement. 
""At present, the situation on the peninsula is at a critical stage,"" the ministry cited Xi as saying. 
China and South Korea should strengthen communication and coordinate the process of promoting the denuclearization of the peninsula and establishing a peace mechanism, Xi said. 
""The key is that the parties concerned meet each other half way, show flexibility, and are able to talk and for those talks to get results,"" he said. 
The two leaders agreed that a second summit between Washington and Pyongyang and a planned visit by North Korean leader Kim to Seoul would be an ""important breakthrough"" in resolving the situation on the peninsula, according to South Korea's presidential office. 
The South Korean presidential spokesman said Xi was also willing to come to South Korea next year at a convenient time. 

South Korea's presidential office issued a transcript of its briefing on the meeting in Port Moresby.

1027,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2018 06:00AM ET</span>",Junior partner says to stay in Bulgarian coalition after resignation,"SOFIA (Reuters) - The junior partner in Bulgaria's ruling center-right coalition reaffirmed its support on Saturday for Prime Minister Boyko Borissov’s 18-month-old government despite the resignation of one of its leaders.
Deputy Prime Minister Valeri Simeonov, one of the leaders of the United Patriots, an alliance of nationalist parties, resigned on Friday after several weeks of street protests over remarks he made about disabled rights activists. 
""Valeri Simeonov has quit in a personal capacity, it is not the party that has quit the coalition,"" Krasimir Karakachanov, also a deputy prime minister and co-leader of the United Patriots, told Nova TV.
""No turmoil is expected in either the ""small"" (nationalist alliance) or the ""big"" (ruling) coalition,"" he said.
Last month Simeonov, who oversaw economic and demographic policy, dismissed a group of protesters demanding an overhaul of Bulgaria's social care system as ""shrill women"" and accused them of using their disabled children as a political tool.
Borissov rebuked Simeonov but said he was unable to sack the minister due to a delicate balance of power in the coalition.
The nationalist alliance is expected to nominate Simeonov's replacement as deputy prime minister next week.
The deputy leader of Borissov's GERB party, Tsvetan Tsvetanov, said the resignation would ""calm the situation"" and that the government would emerge stronger as a consequence.
Disabled rights activists welcomed Simeonov's resignation but said the government needed to do more to soothe social tensions.
Opposition parties have stepped up pressure on the government ahead of elections for the European Parliament and local elections next year.
Bulgaria, the poorest member state in the European Union, faces more protests this weekend over higher fuel prices and tax increases on old-age pensions, though political analysts say they are unlikely to unseat Borissov's government.
Responding to the discontent, the anti-monopoly regulator has said it will examine whether there has been any breach of competition rules in the fuel sector.

Street protests against low living standards and corruption toppled a previous coalition government led by Borissov in 2013.

""The Phoenix is an important piece of evidence to determine the cause of the accident,"" Tourist Police Bureau Deputy Chief, Major General Surachate Hakparn, told reporters. 
""When the case is final, it will be able to restore Chinese tourist confidence,"" he said separately in a statement. 
The Phoenix went down in high seas in July off Thailand's west-coast island of Phuket with 101 people on board, made up of 12 crew members and 89 tourists, all but two of them from China. The ship had been taking the passengers on an outing to a small island for snorkeling. 
An earlier salvage effort was suspended due to weather conditions. 
The capsizing and sinking of the Phoenix was Thailand's worst tourist-related disaster in years and led to a sharp drop in Chinese arrivals in the following months. 
Tourists from China make up the biggest portion of Thailand's visitors, and last year accounted for nearly one-third of a record 35.38 million arrivals. 
Tourism accounts for about 12 percent of Southeast Asia's second-largest economy, making it a key driver of its growth. 
The Thai government has scrambled to restore tourism with schemes such as granting waivers on visa fees. 
""We want to get to the truth (about the Phoenix),"" Surachate said. The effort shows a commitment to the relatives of the dead and will help restore tourism confidence in Thailand, he said.

NANJING, China (Reuters) - Soldiers from China and the United States wrapped up a week of joint disaster relief drills on Saturday, in a display of cooperation against a backdrop of worsening ties between the two countries over trade, the disputed South China Sea and self-ruled Taiwan.
Relations between the world's two largest economies have plumbed new depths under U.S. President Donald Trump, who is due to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Argentina starting late this month. 
The exercise, held in the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing, comes a week after Chinese Defence Minister Wei Fenghe and top diplomat Yang Jiechi visited Washington, where U.S. officials urged China to halt militarization of the South China Sea.
But there was no sign of those strains as Chinese and U.S. soldiers simulated plucking people from earthquake-destroyed buildings and treating survivors' injuries at a People's Liberation Army (PLA) base on the outskirts of Nanjing.
Troops practiced search and rescue in a small mock-up of a devastated urban area post-earthquake, using sniffer dogs and other gear to search for people buried in the fake rubble. 
""Only through more contacts, more exchanges and cooperation in areas of common interest can we effectively increase mutual trust and effectively reduce misjudgments,"" Qin Weijiang, deputy commander of the PLA's eastern theater command, told reporters.
""So I think bilateral exchanges can start from humanitarian and disaster relief exchanges and expand to other areas of common interest.""
Robert Brown, Commanding General of the U.S. Army Pacific, said the exchange was ""extremely important"". 
""Just as our top leaders work towards building a strong working relationship and understanding, we through confidence-building measures like this DME must also at our level build a strong understanding of each other,"" he added, referring to Disaster Management Exchange.
This is the 14th time the joint exchange has been held, which last year took place in the United States. 
China's defense ministry has said it hopes the military relationship can become a ""stabiliser"" for overall ties with the United States.
All the same, Washington and Beijing swapped barbs over trade, investment and regional security at an Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) summit on Saturday in Papua New Guinea.
Regular drills and exchanges are helpful to bilateral relations, particularly at a time of increased friction, but they are not going to fundamentally change the direction that ties are headed, said Michael Chase, a specialist in China and Asia-Pacific security at the RAND Corp.

""These exchanges remain important in that respect even if they aren't going to solve broader problems in the relationship.""

1031,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2018 03:14AM ET</span>",U.S.-China discord dominates APEC summit in Papua New Guinea,"By Tom Westbrook, Charlotte Greenfield and Philip Wen
PORT MORESBY (Reuters) - The United States and China swapped barbs over trade, investment and regional security at an Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) summit on Saturday, as growing fault lines among members suggested little prospect of consensus at the weekend meeting.
Speaking in the Papua New Guinean capital, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said there would be no end to American tariffs until China changed its ways, after its president, Xi Jinping, warned that the shadow of protectionism and unilateralism was hanging over global growth.
Illustrating the impasse between the world's two largest economies, a diplomat involved in negotiating an APEC leaders' declaration told Reuters trade was a sticking point, and the host nation was having trouble finding language acceptable to all.
Pence took direct aim at Xi's flagship Belt and Road program, which China has been promoting to Pacific nations at APEC, saying countries should not accept debt that compromised their sovereignty.
""We do not offer constricting belt or a one-way road,"" Pence told the APEC CEO summit, a precursor to the official leaders' meeting, held on a cruise liner tethered in Port Moresby's Fairfax Harbour.
China's efforts to win friends in the resource-rich Pacific have been watched warily by the traditionally influential powers in the region - Australia and the United States.
U.S. President Donald Trump is not attending the APEC meeting, nor is his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.
Xi, who is staying in Port Moresby, has been feted by PNG officials and stoked Western concern on Friday when he held a meeting with Pacific island leaders, in which he pitched the Belt and Road initiative. 
Speaking before Pence, Xi said there was no geopolitical agenda behind the project, which was unveiled in 2013 and aims to bolster a network of land and sea links with Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa.
""It does not exclude anyone. It is not an exclusive club closed to non-members, nor is it a trap as some people have labeled it.""
There have been concerns that small countries that sign up for infrastructure projects will be left with debt burdens they cannot service, something Pence highlighted.
""Do not accept foreign debt that could compromise your sovereignty. Protect your interest. Preserve your independence. And just like America, always put your country first,"" he said.
Sri Lanka formally handed over commercial activities in its main southern port of Hambantota to a Chinese company last December as part of a plan to convert $6 billion of loans that Sri Lanka owed China into equity.
Soon after Pence spoke, Australia said it was joining the United States and Japan in a partnership that would help countries in the region develop infrastructure priorities, a possible alternative to China's Belt and Road.
REGIONAL SECURITY
Pence also said the United States would join Australia to help Papua New Guinea build a navy base on its Manus Island, which was a U.S. base in World War Two.
The plan comes after China emerged as a possible developer of the deep-water port, which analysts say could impact the West's ability to navigate in the Pacific while offering China a site close to U.S. bases in Guam.
""The United States of America will continue to uphold the freedom of the seas and the skies, which are so essential to our prosperity,"" Pence said.
In a meeting that could irritate Beijing, Pence had talks with Taiwan's envoy to APEC, Morris Chang.
Beijing considers Taiwan a wayward province of ""one China"", ineligible for state-to-state relations, and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control.
Despite Taiwan's lack of diplomatic recognition by the majority of countries, APEC allows it to participate as an economic, rather than political, entity.
Pence later told reporters traveling with him he would ""carry back"" a Taiwan proposal for a free trade agreement. 
DOUBLE TARIFFS?
There were differences between other APEC members, with some calling for radical change to trade systems while others argued for a return to the status quo on globalization.
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad warned globalization was leaving some people behind and fuelling inequality.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison mounted a defense of free trade, saying a billion people had been lifted out of extreme poverty since 1991 because of the jobs and cheaper goods that free trade brought.
Xi told delegates that the shadow of ""protectionism and unilateralism"" hung over global growth and erecting barriers and cutting ties was short-sighted and doomed to fail.
But Pence made it clear that the United States would not back down, saying it could more than double the $250 billion of Chinese goods subject to tariffs.
""The United States though will not change course until China changes its ways,"" Pence said.
Trump and Xi are due to meet at a G20 meeting in Argentina late this month, raising some hope that trade tension could ease.
Trump is pressing China to reduce its huge bilateral trade surplus and make sweeping changes to its policies on trade, technology transfers and high-tech industrial subsidies. 
China has denied that U.S. companies are forced to transfer technology and sees U.S. demands on rolling back its industrial policies as an attempt to contain China’s economic rise.
Sebastián Piñera, the president of Chile, which will host next year's APEC, called on the two powers to find a resolution.
""This is a very good opportunity to ask the U.S. and China to find ways to end their tariff and trade war which benefits no one,"" he told the forum.

""Both countries will have to change course.""

1032,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2018 03:05AM ET</span>",CIA believes Saudi crown prince ordered journalist's killing: sources,"By Mark Hosenball
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The CIA believes Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul, sources familiar with the matter said on Friday, complicating President Donald Trump's efforts to preserve ties with a key U.S. ally. 
The sources said the CIA had briefed other parts of the U.S. government, including Congress, on its assessment, which contradicts Saudi government assertions that Prince Mohammed was not involved. 
The CIA's finding, first reported by the Washington Post, is the most definitive U.S. assessment to date tying Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler directly to the killing.
The Saudi Embassy in Washington rejected the CIA assessment.
""The claims in this purported assessment is false,"" a spokeswoman for the embassy said in a statement. ""We have and continue to hear various theories without seeing the primary basis for these speculations.""
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, on a visit to Papua New Guinea, told reporters traveling with him that he could not comment on classified information.
""The murder of Jamal Khashoggi was an atrocity. It was also an affront to a free and independent press and the United States is determined to hold all of those accountable who are responsible for that murder,"" he said, but added that Washington wanted to preserve its relationship with Saudi Arabia.
The State Department declined to comment.
Trump and top officials of his administration have said Saudi Arabia must be held to account for any involvement in Khashoggi's death, but they have also stressed the importance of the alliance.
U.S. officials have said Saudi Arabia, a major oil supplier, plays an important part in countering what they see as Iran's malign role in the region, and Trump has repeatedly said he does not want to imperil U.S. arms sales to the kingdom. 
While the Trump administration on Thursday imposed sanctions on 17 Saudis for their role in Khashoggi's killing, many lawmakers think the United States should take a tougher stance, and the CIA's findings are likely to embolden that view. 
Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi government and a columnist for the Washington Post, was killed at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 when he went there to pick up documents he needed for his planned marriage to a Turkish woman.
Khashoggi had resisted pressure from Riyadh for him to return home. Saudi officials have said a team of 15 Saudi nationals were sent to confront Khashoggi at the consulate and that he was accidentally killed in a chokehold by men who were trying to force him to return to the kingdom. 
DEATH PENALTY
Turkish officials have said the killing was intentional and have been pressuring Saudi Arabia to extradite those responsible to stand trial. An adviser to Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday accused Saudi Arabia of trying to cover up the murder.
Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor said on Thursday that he was seeking the death penalty for five suspects charged in the killing. The prosecutor, Shalaan al-Shalaan, told reporters the crown prince knew nothing of the operation, in which Khashoggi's body was dismembered and removed from the consulate.
U.S. officials have been skeptical that Prince Mohammed would not have known about plans to kill Khashoggi, given his control over Saudi Arabia.
The Post, citing people familiar with the matter, said the CIA's assessment was based in part on a phone call the crown prince's brother, Prince Khaled bin Salman, the Saudi ambassador to the United States, had with Khashoggi.
Prince Khaled told Khashoggi he should go to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to retrieve the documents and gave him assurances that it would be safe to do so, the Post said.
The newspaper, citing people familiar with the call, said it was not clear if the prince knew Khashoggi would be killed but that he made the call at his brother's direction.
The prince said in a Twitter post on Friday that the last contact he had with Khashoggi was via text on Oct. 26, 2017, nearly a year before the journalist's death.
""I never talked to him by phone and certainly never suggested he go to Turkey for any reason. I ask the US government to release any information regarding this claim,"" Prince Khaled said.
The Post said the CIA also examined a call from inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul after Khashoggi's killing.

Maher Mutreb, a security official who has often been seen at the crown prince's side, made the call to Saud al-Qahtani, a top aide to Prince Mohammed, to inform him the operation had been completed, the Post said, citing people familiar with the call.

Bannon, a former chairman of the right-wing Breitbart.com website and an architect of Trump's 2016 election win, has set up a movement to elect right-wing nationalist and populist members in European Parliament elections in May.
Bannon, who had held a public lecture in Budapest last May, said he has already visited Budapest a couple of times and met Orban and his aides - meetings, which have not been made public.
A government spokesman could not comment immediately.
Orban has welcomed the idea of Bannon's group, called The Movement, saying it was time that someone from the United States came to Europe to spread conservative thinking instead of liberal values.
""If I could, we would headquarter the movement in Budapest. I love it so much there. But obviously it is not practical. We will spend a lot of time in Hungary between now and election day,"" Bannon told RTL in an interview published late on Friday.
Since sweeping to power in 2010, Orban, once a campaigner against Hungary's Soviet Communist overlords, has used his parliamentary majority to pressure courts, media and non-government groups in ways his opponents say breach EU rules.
The European Parliament voted in September to sanction Hungary for flouting EU rules on democracy, civil rights and corruption in an unprecedented step.
Orban has also led opposition to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and others who want Europe to take in more Muslim refugees.
""Hopefully when we get the Movement fully up and running we'll engage,"" Bannon told RTL.
""John McLaughlin who is my pollster in the United States is going to run this overall polling effort in Europe, he is also the pollster for Orban in Hungary.""
Bannon said next year's European elections would bring a clash between forces led by core EU members such as Germany and France, who want more integration and euroskeptic nations like Hungary, which seek an alliance of strong member states.

Bannon said he would visit Budapest again in late November.

PORT MORESBY (Reuters) - The United States will join Pacific ally Australia to build a naval base on Papua New Guinea's Manus Island, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said, amid a push by regional powers to lock in alliances and secure access to key infrastructure.
The plan, which comes on the heels of China's emergence as a possible developer of the deep-water site, was unveiled on Saturday at a Asia-Pacific forum hosted by Papua New Guinea (PNG) where world leaders voiced competing visions on how trade should be conducted in the region. 
Analysts say a Chinese presence on Manus Island could impact the West's ability to navigate the Pacific while offering Beijing close access to U.S. bases in Guam.
Manus Island was a major U.S. naval base during the Second World War, playing a key role in Washington's Pacific strategy. Recently, it has hosted one of Australia's two controversial offshore immigration detention centres.
Pence said the United States would partner with Australia and PNG on the Manus Island port project.
""We will work with these nations to protect the sovereignty and maritime rights of Pacific islands as well,"" Pence said.
""And you can be confident, the U.S. will continue to uphold the freedom of the seas and the skies.""
Australia, a staunch U.S. ally, has for decades enjoyed largely unrivalled influence in the Pacific until China recently turned its attention to the region.
The United States has had a long-running dispute with China over maritime routes in the South China Sea. That has extended to the Pacific over concerns Beijing may use its increased influence, backed by its emerging status as a major bilateral lender to island economies, to secure access to infrastructure that could be used for military purposes, including deep-water ports and wharfs.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced on Nov. 1 that his country would fund development of the base on Manus Island with the support of the PNG government.
But neither party has sought support from local residents, Manus Island Governor Charlie Benjamin has said. Communities in sprawling, resources-rich PNG have at times opposed decisions made by the central government. 
Manus Island is PNG's smallest province with a population of about 50,000 people. 
Australian and PNG government representatives did not respond to requests for comment.
PNG's navy is made up largely of patrol boats, mostly donated by Australia, and landing craft. 

Morrison has previously said that Australia's navy would make visits to the new base on Manus Island.

In a bluntly worded speech at an Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) summit in Papua New Guinea, Pence threw down the gauntlet to China on trade and security in the region.
""We have taken decisive action to address our imbalance with China,"" Pence declared. ""We put tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese goods, and we could more than double that number.""
""The United States, though, will not change course until China changes its ways.""
The stark warning will likely be unwelcome news to financial markets which had hoped for a thaw in the Sino-U.S. dispute and perhaps even some sort of deal at a G20 meeting later this month in Argentina.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who is not attending the APEC meeting, is due to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in Argentina.
Pence's warning on Saturday contrasted with remarks made by Trump on Friday, when he said he may not impose more tariffs after China sent the United States a list of measures it was willing to take to resolve trade tensions.
Trump has imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports to force concessions on a list of demands that would change the terms of trade between the two countries. China has responded with import tariffs on U.S. goods.
Washington is demanding Beijing improve market access and intellectual property protections for U.S. companies, cut industrial subsidies and slash a $375 billion trade gap.
There was no hint of compromise from Pence.
""China has taken advantage of the United States for many years. Those days are over,"" he told delegates gathered on a cruise liner docked in Port Moresby's Fairfax Harbour.
He also took aim at China's territorial ambitions in the Pacific and, particularly, Xi's Belt and Road Initiative to expand land and sea links between Asia, Africa and Europe with billions of dollars in infrastructure investment.
""We don't offer constricting belts or a one-way road,"" said Pence.
While not referring directly to Chinese claims over various disputed waters in the region, Pence said the United States would work to help protect maritime rights.
""We will continue to fly and sail where ever international law allows and our interests demand. Harassment will only strengthen our resolve.""
Just minutes earlier, Xi had spoken at length about his initiative and the need for free trade across the region.
""It is not an exclusive club closed to non-members, nor is it a trap as some people have labeled it,"" Xi said of his brainchild project.
He also called protectionism a ""shortsighted approach"" that was ""doomed to fail"".

""History has shown that confrontation, whether in the form of a Cold War, hot war, or trade war will produce no winners,"" said Xi.

Despite Taiwan's lack of diplomatic recognition by the vast majority of countries, APEC allows the island to participate as a separate economic, rather than political, entity.

The new consultation comes on the heels of another informal referendum that called for canceling the construction of a partially-built $13 billion new airport for Mexico City.
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador used the results of that consultation to say his administration, which takes office on Dec. 1, would halt the airport project. That decision left investors fretting over how he would manage the economy, with the peso currency and stock market reeling.
It was unclear whether the results of the new consultation would be binding.
The incoming administration will set up 1,102 polling stations across the nation where residents will be asked to fill out a form and answer ""yes"" or ""no"" on the 10 policy points.
They include whether to guarantee access to healthcare to residents that currently lack those services, offer training and scholarships to 2.6 million youth, and double pensions for citizens over 68 years old.
Residents will vote on the construction of the so-called ""Mayan Train"", a rail line that will run 1,500 kilometers and connect five southern Mexican states.

(Reuters) - Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams admitted defeat in her effort to become the first black female U.S. governor on Friday, but said she planned to sue the state over voting problems and ""gross mismanagement"" of the election. 
Abrams' announcement effectively hands victory to Republican Brian Kemp in a bitter race that has drawn national attention both for her historic campaign and for Kemp's role as the state's top election administrator.
Abrams accused Kemp of using his position as Georgia Secretary of State to interfere with the vote - an allegation he has strongly denied. 
""To watch an elected official who claims to represent the people in this state baldly pin his hopes for election on the suppression of the people’s democratic right to vote has been truly appalling,"" Abrams told supporters in Atlanta. 
""So let’s be clear: This is not a speech of concession, because concession means to acknowledge an action as right, true or proper,"" she said.
State officials were expected to certify Kemp as the winner as soon as Friday night.
""The election is over and hardworking Georgians are ready to move forward,"" Kemp said on Twitter. ""We can no longer dwell on the divisive politics of the past but must focus on Georgia’s bright and promising future.""
Kemp, 55, resigned his post as Secretary of State after the Nov. 6 election and did not oversee the final ballot review.
Abrams, 44, had considered a court challenge to force a runoff, which is allowed by state law if neither candidate gets a majority of the vote. Initial results showed Kemp just over that threshold.
Instead, she said she would sue the state for what she called ""gross mismanagement of this election"" and to protect future elections. She said she would start a new organization, Fair Fight Georgia, to advocate for voting rights.
Voters in Georgia reported long lines at polling places as aging technology was swamped by the volume of people seeking to cast ballots. Prior to election day, groups has sued to prevent Kemp from throwing out more than 50,000 voter-registration forms that had been put on hold because personal information did not exactly match state databases. The lawsuit alleged that the ""exact match"" law disproportionately affected black voters.
RECOUNT IN FLORIDA
Abrams's announcement comes as several other races across the country remain unresolved.
In neighboring Florida, election officials were slogging through a hand recount of ballots to determine who won a hard-fought U.S. Senate contest.
Outgoing Republican Governor Rick Scott held a narrow lead over incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson after an electronic recount was completed on Thursday. Officials have until noon on Sunday to tally any votes missed by electronic voting machines. 
Scott's campaign has called on Nelson to drop out, saying it was mathematically impossible to make up the difference of about 12,600 votes, 0.15 percent of the more than 8 million ballots cast. Nelson's lawyer, Marc Elias, has said he expects Scott's lead to ultimately disappear as the recount continues.
On Friday, a federal judge rejected one of the limited paths to carry Nelson’s chances forward. U.S. District Judge Mark Walker in Tallahassee denied an appeal by Nelson’s supporters to allow mail-in ballots that arrived after the state deadline to be counted.
In another tight Florida contest, Republican Ron DeSantis appeared to secure the governor's seat over Democrat Andrew Gillum after the electronic recount showed DeSantis with a 0.4 percentage point lead, outside the threshold to trigger a hand recount. The state is scheduled to certify results on Tuesday.
Scenes of thousands of people across the state reviewing ballots brought back memories of Florida's 2000 presidential recount, which ended only after the U.S. Supreme Court stepped in, effectively handing the presidency to Republican George W. Bush.
The result of the Nelson-Scott race will not change the balance of power in the Senate, where Republicans extended their lead in the Nov. 6 midterm vote, while Democrats took a majority in the House of Representatives. 
Along with the unresolved Florida senate race, Republican Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi is headed to a Nov. 27 runoff against Democrat Mike Espy after neither candidate secured a majority of the vote in a four-way race. 

About 10 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives remain up in the air.

1041,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2018 06:10PM ET</span>",Trump says he 'easily' answered Russia probe questions,"By Jeff Mason
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Friday said he had ""very easily"" completed his written answers for Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 U.S. election, but had not yet submitted them to Mueller's office. 
Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump said he wrote the answers to the questions himself.
""My lawyers don't write answers. I write answers. I was asked a series of questions. I've answered them very easily,"" Trump said.
The Republican president did not specify when his legal team would give Mueller his written responses, but a person familiar with the matter told Reuters they likely would be submitted next week. Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment.
""I'm sure they're tricked-up because, you know, they like to catch people,"" Trump said, referring to questions that he suggested could be designed to result in perjury charges. ""You have to always be careful when you answer, with people that probably have bad intentions. Now, the questions were very routinely answered by me.""
Mueller is investigating whether members of Trump's campaign conspired with Moscow in the 2016 election and whether Trump has unlawfully sought to obstruct the probe, which has clouded his presidency.
Trump and his lawyers had been in negotiations with Mueller's team for months over how the president would be questioned as part of the investigation.
Trump's team agreed to have the president submit written answers to questions relating to Russia's role in the election, but it is still possible Mueller may press Trump to answer questions on potential obstruction at some point. Another open question is whether Trump will eventually sit for an interview.
Tensions have risen over the probe since Trump last week ousted Jeff Sessions as U.S. attorney general and named Matthew Whitaker as his replacement on an acting basis. That move gave Whitaker, a Trump loyalist who Democrats have called a ""political lackey,"" oversight of the Mueller probe.
Mueller already has brought charges against a series of former Trump aides, including his former campaign chairman and his former national security adviser, as well as a number of Russian individuals and entities.
A federal judge on Thursday refused to dismiss criminal charges against Concord Management and Consulting LLC, a Russia company accused by Mueller of funding a propaganda operation to sway the 2016 election in Trump's favor. 
Trump on Friday again called the probe a ""witch hunt"" and said there was no collusion. Russia has denied any interference.
""There should have never been a so-called investigation, which, in theory, it's not an investigation of me. But ... as far as I'm concerned, I like to take everything personally because you do better that way,"" Trump added.
Democrats and a number of Republicans have raised concerns about Whitaker's appointment, with a bipartisan group of U.S. senators renewing a push for legislation to protect the special counsel. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, has opposed any such legislation. 

Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who has said he would seek to lead the Senate panel overseeing the Justice Department next year, on Thursday met with Whitaker and expressed confidence the Russia probe would continue.

""We don't have anything to hide here. Disruption is a serious matter which disturbs civil aviation. We will act toward Russia, we will discuss this and we expect answers,"" Finnish Foreign Minister Timo Soini said in a statement to public broadcaster Yle while on a state visit to the United States. 
The Finnish foreign ministry said on Thursday that the disruption of Finland's GPS signal during recent NATO war games came from Russian territory.
The Kremlin on Monday dismissed an earlier allegation from Finland that Russia may have intentionally disrupted the signal during the war games.
Earlier in November, Finland's air navigation services issued a warning for air traffic due to a large-scale GPS interruption in the north of the country. Russia was also recently accused by Norway, which had posted a similar warning in its own airspace.
Finland is not a NATO member but it took part as an ally in NATO's largest exercise in decades which ended on Wednesday. Forces from 31 countries participated in the games close to Russia, in an area stretching from the Baltic Sea to Iceland.
Finland shares an 833-mile (1,340-km) border and a difficult history with Russia.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Britain said on Friday it will push the United Nations Security Council to back a humanitarian truce in Yemen as the U.N. Yemen envoy said the warring parties had given ""firm assurances"" they were committed to attending peace talks shortly in Sweden.
British U.N. Ambassador Karen Pierce said she would give the 15-member council a draft resolution on Monday that would enshrine five requests made by U.N. aid chief Mark Lowcock, one of which was for a truce around infrastructure and facilities on which the aid operation and commercial importers rely.
Pierce said the aim of the resolution would be to put Lowcock's call ""into practice."" She gave no timeline for when the draft resolution could be put to a vote.
The remaining four requests were for protection of the supply of food and essential goods, a larger, faster injection of foreign exchange into the economy through the central bank, increased humanitarian funding and support, and for the warring parties to engage in peace talks.
""This is a crucial moment for Yemen,"" said U.N. Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths, who is trying to convene peace talks in Sweden before the end of the year. 
""I have received firm assurances from the leadership of the Yemeni parties ... that they are committed to attending these consultations. I believe they are genuine,"" he told the Security Council on Friday.
He is trying to broker peace in the more than three-year-old conflict seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. A Saudi-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Iran-allied Houthi group.
U.N. food chief David Beasley said the situation in Yemen was ""a catastrophe.""
The Houthis now rule most of Yemen's population, while the exiled government controls a section of the south. An attempt to hold peace talks in Geneva in September was abandoned after three days of waiting for the Houthi delegation.
""I will go to Sanaa next week ... I will also be happy to travel myself, if necessary, with the delegation to the consultations,"" Griffiths said. He is aiming to convene talks before the end of the year.
The Houthis had said in September that they wanted U.N. guarantees their plane would not have to stop in Djibouti for inspection by the Saudi-led coalition. They also wanted the plane to evacuate some of their wounded to Oman or Europe.
Griffith said he believed he was close to resolving preparatory issues to allow the talks in Sweden to happen.
""I am grateful to the coalition for agreeing our proposed logistical arrangements, and to the coalition and Oman for their agreement to facilitate the medical evacuation of some injured Yemenis out of Sanaa,"" he told the 15-member Security Council. 
Griffiths also said the parties were about to conclude an agreement on the exchange of prisoners and detainees.

1044,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2018 04:05PM ET</span>",Canada set to get most refugee claims in nearly three decades,"By Anna Mehler Paperny
TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada is on track to receive its highest number of refugee claims since record-keeping began nearly three decades ago, the latest data shows, as the government's handling of immigration comes under scrutiny ahead of next year's federal election.
Despite cooler weather, the number of refugee claimants jumped past 6,000 in October, the highest monthly tally this year, the data released on Thursday showed.
That takes total claims in the first 10 months of 2018 to 46,245, putting the country on track to surpass last year's record even as the quasi-judicial body that adjudicates claims struggles to work through a 64,000-person backlog.
The Immigration and Refugee Board started tracking refugee claimant data in 1989.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government faces a widely held belief that Canada has been overwhelmed by immigrants pressing asylum claims, even though it receives far fewer than many other countries. The government has struggled to balance Canada's reputation as a haven for those fleeing persecution with warnings that filing refugee claims is no ""free ticket"" to remain in the country.
The governing Liberals have come under fire for their handling of the more than 37,000 people who have walked across the Canada-U.S. border seeking asylum since January 2017 -- many of whom told Reuters they did not feel safe in President Donald Trump's United States.
About 1,400 crossed the frontier in October, down from 1,600 the month before. But most refugee claimants enter the country by other means, and their numbers are growing.
""There are 65 million refugees in the world, and there are many desperate people trying to find safety and refuge in western countries,"" said Toronto-based lawyer Lorne Waldman. ""I think we're going to see 50,000-plus (refugee claims annually) for the foreseeable future.""
A spokesman for Immigration and Refugees Minister Ahmed Hussen noted that this year's budget included an additional C$74 million ($56 million) for the Immigration and Refugee Board ""to speed up the processing of asylum claims."" The hiring of 248 new staff ""is under way,"" spokesman Mathieu Genest wrote in an email.
About 56 percent of refugee claims finalized in the first three quarters of 2018 were accepted, according to the Immigration and Refugee Board, with lower acceptance rates for border-crossers.
Border-crossers from Nigeria and Haiti, who made up the largest groups of border-crossers, had relatively low acceptance rates compared with other nationalities, at 29.3 percent and 11.6 percent, respectively. 
Canada's government is trying to hasten the deportations of border-crossers whose refugee claims are not successful, classifying them with criminals as a top deportation priority.
The government should also prioritize integration of successful applicants, said Canadian Council for Refugees head Janet Dench, and ensure that tens of thousands of people are not left waiting years for permanent resident status.

""The longer you keep people in this limbo state, the longer before they can contribute fully to Canadian society.""

JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Mourners paid their respects on Friday to the family of Jamal Khashoggi, the prominent Saudi writer murdered by agents of his own government, after the authorities said they had identified the culprits and cleared the crown prince of any involvement.
Two of Khashoggi's brothers and one of his sons received a few hundred men in the coastal city of Jeddah a day after the Saudi public prosecutor said it would seek the death penalty for five unnamed suspects in the killing inside the country's Istanbul consulate on Oct. 2.
Earlier on Friday, tens of thousands of worshippers prayed for the deceased in Mecca and Medina, Khashoggi's hometown, though the imams did not name him.
In rainy Istanbul, mourners listened to Koranic recitations. Friends eulogized the 59-year-old royal insider-turned-critic, and politicians who knew him denounced Riyadh's investigation as biased.
Saudi authorities say the operation that led to Khashoggi's death was meant to repatriate him alive, but their shifting accounts - including initial denials - have been met with scepticism and furor abroad.
Two officials allegedly behind the plan are close to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Turkey and some Western allies, including U.S. President Donald Trump, have said ultimate responsibility lies with Prince Mohammed as the country's de facto ruler. Riyadh says he had nothing to do with the murder.
In an unusual measure against an important security and economic partner, the U.S. Treasury on Thursday imposed economic sanctions on 17 Saudis, including Saud al-Qahtani, the crown prince's former top adviser.
The decision to hold prayer services in the absence of a body suggests the family does not expect it to be recovered. Despite entreaties, Saudi authorities have not revealed its whereabouts, saying only that it was dismembered and removed from the consulate.
Islamic tradition places great importance on the proper handling of the dead, mandating quick burial, so the mistreatment of the body is particularly disturbing.
Khashoggi's son, Salah, told CNN last week that he wanted to bury his father in Medina with the rest of the family, saying ""We just need to make sure that he rests in peace.""
Salah had previously met the king and crown prince in Riyadh to receive condolences, then departed for Washington after a travel ban was lifted but has since returned.
IN THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD
The reception attracted a who's who of the country's relatively cosmopolitan Hejaz region, including veteran Saudi journalists and former senior officials who had worked with Khashoggi. There were several businessmen - like Saleh Kamel and his sons - who had been detained in a corruption purge last year ordered by Prince Mohammed.
Senior U.S. and British diplomats attended. A senior cleric with ministerial rank also came, but no top royals appeared.
Incense filled the hall as mourners paid their respects to the family with a few words and a hand on the shoulder or a hug. A relative recited a Koranic verse saying, ""Don't think of those killed in God's service as dead, for they are alive and find sustenance in the presence of the Lord.""
Sipping small cups of Arabic coffee, some chatted about the scandal that has engulfed Saudi Arabia for the past six weeks.
""It has turned from a crime into a political matter,"" one said. Another just kept repeating the word, ""Unbelievable.""
Khashoggi's Turkish fiancée, who had waited outside the consulate for hours on the day he was killed, on Thursday tweeted a selfie of him, writing: ""Dear Jamal.. rest in peace. We will meet in heaven inshallah (God willing)..!""
The pair had met at a conference in Istanbul in May and soon decided to wed. He had entered the consulate that day to obtain documents proving an earlier marriage had ended.
They purchased an apartment in Istanbul and Khashoggi was planning to live between there and Washington, where he moved 18 months earlier fearing reprisals for his views. He obtained U.S. residency and wrote for the Washington Post, becoming familiar to many American policymakers.
""I have left my home, my family and my job, and I am raising my voice. To do otherwise would betray those who languish in prison,"" he wrote in September 2017, referring to intellectuals, activists and clerics arrested under Prince Mohammed.
His murder has provoked the biggest political crisis in a generation for Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter and a supporter of Washington's plans to contain Iranian influence across the Middle East.

It has also tarnished the image of Prince Mohammed, who has pushed social and economic reforms while cracking down on dissent, upending the delicate balance inside the ruling family, and leading the country into messy conflicts in Yemen and Qatar.

1046,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2018 03:29PM ET</span>",Merkel tells people of Chemnitz: Don't let haters set the agenda,"CHEMNITZ, Germany (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday urged people to stand up against hatred and reject ""lies"" about a U.N. migration accord during her first visit to the city of Chemnitz since a spate of far-right violence that tarnished Germany's image abroad.
Germans were shocked by images of skinheads chasing migrants in the eastern city after the fatal stabbing of a man was blamed on two migrants, one of whom was later released from custody. Members of the far right also clashed with police, performed the banned Hitler salute and attacked a Jewish restaurant.
The violence exposed deep divisions over Merkel's 2015 decision to welcome almost one million mostly Muslim asylum seekers, and nearly led to the collapse of her government.
Merkel fielded tough questions about that policy and other issues during a two-hour town hall with local residents, calmly telling a man who asked when she would ""finally resign"" that she would serve out her term, and adding, ""We should all accept the results of democratic elections.""
The conservative leader, now in her fourth term, has said she will step down as leader of her Christian Democrats, but plans to remain chancellor through 2021.
But she grew emotional herself on the issue of the United Nations pact to regulate the treatment of migrants worldwide, which she said was being grossly misrepresented by opponents.
""When there's a lie, we have to expose it,"" Merkel said, insisting that the migration pact - approved in July by all 193 member U.N. nations except the United States - was in Germany's interest since it would require African states and others to halt illegal migration.
""The sovereignty of this country will not be diminished in any way. We will have the right to continue making our own laws,"" Merkel said, when asked why Germany supported the pact and others like Poland and the Czech Republic were opposing it.
""What we cannot do is let those who spread hatred and incitement to set our daily agenda,"" she said.
Merkel defended her decision not to visit Chemnitz sooner, saying she had not wanted to further polarize the situation. 
She also pushed back against critics of media coverage that some felt maligned their city, and said it was incumbent upon those opposed to anti-migrant violence to speak up.
""Those who have nothing to do with (the violence) ... you can't just say it's the journalists who make Chemnitz look bad. You have to say, we are also Chemnitz and we want to raise our voices.""
The violence tarnished Germany's image abroad and took Merkel's government to the brink of collapse after the domestic spy chief questioned the authenticity of videos showing far-right nationalists chasing immigrants through the city.
A row over the fate of the spymaster, Hans-Georg Maassen, pitted Merkel's hardline Interior Minister, Horst Seehofer, against her junior coalition partner, the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), who demanded that Maassen must go.

Seehofer initially rescued Maassen from dismissal but later sacked him over a speech given behind closed doors condemning ""naive and leftist"" government policies.

Simeonov, who oversaw economic and demographic policy, is one of the leaders of the United Patriots, an alliance of nationalist parties that together form the junior coalition partner in the center-right government of Prime Minister Boyko Borissov that took office in May 2017.
Simeonov had called the activists ""shrill women"" and suggested that they were ""speculating"" with their sick children. He apologized a week after his comment became public and only after a meeting of the coalition partners.
Borissov himself had apologized on Simeonov's behalf but also said he could not seek his resignation without putting the government at risk, as the ruling coalition has just a one-seat majority in parliament.
Simeonov's party is expected to continue to support the government.
The opposition Socialists and the ethnic Turkish MRF party had also demanded Simeonov's resignation and boycotted sessions in parliament.
""I am handing in my resignation following the continued media campaign against me,"" Simeonov said late on Friday in the government building.
""This campaign is damaging the government's rating and authority and is becoming an obstacle to its normal work. This is something I cannot afford,"".
""It is not just about me, it is not about the party I lead, it is about the ruling government, which I think is extremely successful,"" he said.
Borissov has accepted his resignation, the government press office said.
The opposition has stepped up pressure on Borissov's government ahead of elections for the European parliament and local elections next year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Friday denied that it was planning an extradition deal designed to persuade the Turkish president to ease off on a probe over the killing of a journalist in an Istanbul embassy. 
NBC News reported on Thursday that the Trump administration had been seeking ways to extradite U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who is wanted in Turkey over accusations that he was involved in a failed 2016 coup, in order to appease Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan.
It said the move was designed to persuade Erdogan to ease pressure on Saudi Arabia over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month. Trump has sought closer ties with Saudi Arabia, citing Riyadh's role in countering Iranian influence in the region, and billions of dollars in potential arms deals.
In a statement on Friday, Justice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas Oxman denied the NBC report, saying the department ""has not been involved in nor aware of any discussions"" connecting an extradition of Gulen and the death of Khashoggi.
The denial was unusual for the Justice Department, which typically does not comment on matters pertaining to potential cases of extradition.
Navas Oxman would not comment beyond the statement.
The NBC report said that Trump administration officials had asked U.S. law enforcement agencies to look into whether Gulen could legally be forced out of the United States.
The report said that the administration had directed the Justice Department and FBI to reexamine a request from Turkey for Gulen's extradition and also asked the Department of Homeland Security for information about his legal status.
A White House official, who declined to be named, also denied the NBC report on Thursday, saying it ""has not been involved in any discussions relating the extradition of Fethullah Gulen to the death of Jamal Khashoggi.""
Erdogan has long demanded that Washington extradite Gulen, who denies any involvement in the attempted coup and has lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since 1999. 

Erdogan ramped up pressure on Saudi Arabia after U.S.-based journalist Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi rulers, was killed at the consulate, where he had gone to pick up documents related to his upcoming marriage.

1049,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2018 02:38PM ET</span>",UK PM May defends Brexit deal as opponents plot no-confidence vote,"By Costas Pitas and Alistair Smout
LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May won the backing of the most prominent Brexiteer in her government on Friday as she fought to save a draft European Union divorce deal that has stirred up a plot to force her out of her job.
More than two years after the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU, it is still unclear how, on what terms or even if it will leave as planned on March 29, 2019.
Just hours after announcing that her senior ministers had collectively backed her divorce deal, May was thrust into her premiership's most perilous crisis when her Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab resigned on Thursday to oppose the agreement.
Other mutinous lawmakers in her party have openly spoken of ousting her and said the Brexit deal would not pass parliament.
But May, who has defiantly vowed to stay on as prime minister, got a rare boost on Friday when Michael Gove, the most prominent Brexit-supporting minister, gave his backing to her, saying he would stay on as environment minister.
Asked if he had confidence in May, Gove told reporters: ""I absolutely do.""
""I think it's absolutely vital that we focus on getting the right deal in the future, and making sure that in the areas that matter so much to the British people we can get a good outcome,"" said Gove, 51, a potential successor to May.
Trade minister Liam Fox, another leading Brexit supporter, joined Gove in backing May - but her future remains uncertain.
The first question she faced on an LBC radio phone-in show to defend her deal was from a caller who asked her to ""respectfully stand down"". She did not immediately address that part of the caller's question.
Stephen Barclay, a little-known junior health minister, was appointed as the new Brexit secretary, although the status of the role was downgraded from chief negotiator with May leading the completion of talks with the EU.
""We now need to keep up the momentum to finalize the Withdrawal Agreement and outline political declaration, and deliver a Brexit that works for the whole UK,"" Barclay tweeted.
May's spokesman said Barclay would have a domestic role. ""The PM will be completing the last 10 days of negotiations,"" he said. Former interior minister Amber Rudd was named work and pensions secretary, replacing Esther McVey who also quit over the Brexit plan.
Sterling , which has see-sawed on Brexit news since the referendum, was up half a cent against the dollar at $1.2834 on Friday.
PLOTTERS
Politicians, officials and diplomats in London openly questioned how long May had left as speculation swirled that a leadership challenge could come soon. 
Under Conservative Party rules, a vote must take place when 48 of her lawmakers submit letters to the party's so-called 1922 committee, chaired by a senior lawmaker, Graham Brady.
Influential Brexit-supporting lawmaker Steve Baker said rebels in May's party were close to that threshold. So far, at least 21 lawmakers have publicly said they have submitted letters, and others may have done so privately.
""I think we're probably not far off,"" said Baker, a key figure in the Brexit-backing wing of May's party. ""I think it probably is imminent, yes,"" he told BBC TV. 
British political correspondents reported that Gove, Fox and other pro-Brexit ministers would meet this weekend to amend May's deal. However, both the Irish and Dutch prime ministers said there was little scope to change the proposals.
Since she won the top job in the turmoil that followed the 2016 referendum, May's premiership has been characterized by obduracy in the face of frequent crises.
CONFIDENCE VOTE
Her de facto deputy, David Lidington, said she would win a vote of no confidence, in which she would need a simple majority of votes cast by conservative lawmakers: ""If those letters were to go in, I think that she would win any such vote decisively, and she'd deserve to do so.""
If her divorce deal is voted down, the ultimate outcome of Brexit would be uncertain. Other possible scenarios include May's deal ultimately winning approval in a new parliamentary vote; May losing her job; Britain leaving the bloc with no agreement; or even another referendum.
A snap poll by Survation of 1,070 voters for the Daily Mail newspaper found 49 percent of respondents opposed the deal and just 27 percent backed it. 
The deal is due to be discussed at an EU summit on Nov. 25. 
By seeking to preserve the closest possible ties with the EU, May has upset her party's many advocates of a clean break, and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which props up her minority government.
""They've raised some questions with us, they've raised some concerns with us and yes we are looking at those,"" May said. ""We are still working with the DUP."" 
NIGHTMARE FOR BUSINESS? 
The EU and Britain need an agreement to keep trade flowing between the world's biggest trading bloc and the United Kingdom, home to the biggest international financial center.
May told LBC radio the threat of a no deal Brexit was personal as she is Type 1 diabetic: ""I depend on insulin every day. My insulin is produced by a country elsewhere in the European Union.""
May's spokeswoman said there had been strong business support for her draft deal.

But aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce's (l:RR) boss Warren East said (L:RR) his firm was pressing on with contingency plans, including ""buffer stocks so that we have all the logistical capacity that we need to carry on running our business.""

TIJUANA, Mexico (Reuters) - Central American migrants on Mexico's northern border are coming under pressure from two sides as the Trump administration blocks asylum to anyone entering the United States illegally, while local politicians question whether they should be in Mexico.
U.S. President Donald Trump has sent almost 6,000 troops to fortify the U.S-Mexico border, and has threatened to close the frontier entirely to keep out the migrants. 
In addition, an order issued by Trump means migrants must now present themselves at U.S. ports of entry, such as the Mexican border city of Tijuana, to have any chance of qualifying for refugee status. The order came into effect on Saturday. 
City authorities say around 2,000 migrants are now in Tijuana, where some residents have not taken kindly to the arrival of the Central Americans, many of whom set out from Honduras a month ago to escape violence and poverty.
More are expected to arrive this weekend.
Tijuana mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum criticized the recent arrivals, describing some as ""bums."" He said a consultation would be held on whether the city, which lies some 17 miles (27 km) across the border from San Diego, California, should have to continue receiving the migrants.
In an interview with Milenio television, Gastelum complained that migrants had been hostile to local authorities and that the federal government had failed to control its southern border when the caravan of people began entering Mexico on Oct. 19.
""Tijuana is now in a serious predicament,"" he said late on Thursday, noting that road blocks could be considered to stop more migrants from getting into the city. ""It's not fair.""
With many relatives living in the United States, Mexicans have traditionally shown support for migrants. However, a recent survey by polling firm Consulta Mitofsky showed just over a third of Mexicans wanted the migrants to be sent home.
Some of the Central Americans now clustered in the city's streets and migrant shelters were unsure what the future held.
Exhausted, and stretched out on the floor of a migrant shelter, Honduran Alejandro Martinez said he did not have an alternative plan if the United States turned him away. 
""I haven't thought about what I'll do if they don't let me in. I'm going with faith in God that everything will turn out fine,"" the 24-year-old Martinez said.
Many migrants Reuters spoke to in the shelters were unaware of the U.S. government attempts to deter them and said they were determined to forge ahead however they could.
Others are opting to stay in Mexico, which is processing 2,600 asylum requests from migrants in the caravan, the government said on Thursday.
Remaining in Mexico could be an option if the United States rejects him, said Erick Cortes, a 28-year-old construction worker, who said he fled gang threats in Honduras.

""It could be Mexico, it could be another country. But return to Honduras? Never,"" he said. ""I want to work so my family can get out of the hell they're in.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors are preparing to pursue a criminal case against Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, escalating a long battle targeting his anti-secrecy group even as he remains holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy in London.
Prosecutors have obtained a sealed indictment against Assange, something that emerged in a Thursday filing in an unrelated criminal case in a Virginia federal court. Because the indictment was sealed, the nature of any charges against Assange has not been made public at this point.
Thursday's filing had also been sealed, but it was made public for reasons that were unclear, according to a person familiar with the matter. Joshua Stueve, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Alexandria, Virginia, said the filing was made in error. 
Wikileaks said in a Twitter post it was an ""apparent cut-and-paste error.""
Criminal charges in the United States could pressure Britain to extradite Assange, an Australian national. U.S. officials have acknowledged that federal prosecutors have been conducting a lengthy criminal probe into Assange and Wikileaks.
Assange could not be reached for comment.
Wikileaks became known over the last decade for publishing documents that were not previously public. In a recent high profile instance, during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign the group published some of a trove of Democratic emails that U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded were hacked by Russia.
Intelligence agencies said Russia used hacking and other tactics to try to tilt the election in favor of Republican candidate Donald Trump. Moscow has denied this.
Lawyers for Assange and others have said his work with Wikileaks was critical to a free press and was protected speech.
""The notion that federal criminal charges could be brought based on the publication of truthful information is an incredibly dangerous precedent to set,” Barry Pollack, a U.S. lawyer for Assange, said in a statement.
Wikileaks said in a statement on Friday that Assange was willing to work with British officials as long he was not extradited to the United States.
Assange took refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden for questioning over allegations of rape, which he has denied.
Sweden dropped its investigation of Assange, but Britain has said that if he left the embassy he would be arrested for violating his bail terms.
Greg Barns, an Australian lawyer advising Assange, said in a statement it was ""no surprise"" that the United States was seeking to charge Assange, and Australian officials should allow Assange to return there.
Ecuadorean officials had no immediate comment on Friday. 
'KEEP CONFIDENTIAL'
Thursday's filing mentioning Assange related to a criminal case involving a 29-year-old man charged with enticing a 15-year-old girl.
The judge wrote in a detention memo that the defendant, Seitu Sulayman Kokayi, ""has had a substantial interest in terrorist acts."" Reuters was unable to locate Kokayi.
A source familiar with the matter said the Koyaki case was totally unrelated to investigations of Assange or Wikileaks.
It was not clear why the filing referred to Assange, but it said that any procedure ""short of sealing will not adequately protect the needs of law enforcement at this time because, due to the sophistication of the defendant, and the publicity surrounding the case, no other procedure is likely to keep confidential the fact that Assange has been charged."" 
Wikileaks gained prominence in 2010 after publishing a classified video showing a 2007 U.S. helicopter attack in Iraq that killed a dozen people, including two Reuters news staff.
It has also released thousands of classified U.S. military documents, among other disclosures. 
In April last year, when he was head of the CIA, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called Wikileaks a ""hostile intelligence service.""

Trump praised Wikileaks during his 2016 campaign.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka's parliament descended into chaos for a second day on Friday as lawmakers supporting newly appointed Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa threw books, chili paste and water bottles at the speaker to try to disrupt a second no-confidence motion.
The vote went ahead anyway and for a second time lawmakers gave Rajapaksa and his new government the thumbs down, potentially strengthening the hand of Wickremesinghe, who is seeking to return as prime minister.
Wickremesinghe was removed by President Maithripala Sirisena late last month and replaced with Rajapaksa, plunging the island off India's southeast coast into political turmoil.
Rajapaksa is seen as a close ally of China, though Beijing has denied accusations that it was instrumental in getting him appointed.
Wickremesinghe said ""anarchy"" could result if the president did not recognize the second non-confidence vote. He was speaking to foreign correspondents at the prime minister's official residence, which he has refused to vacate.
""We have the majority,"" he earlier told reporters. ""We can form our government and we will act accordingly.""
Lakshman Yapa Abeywardene, from Sirisena's Sri Lanka Freedom Party, said the president had rejected the second vote . Sirisena's office did not respond to calls seeking comment.
With parliament scheduled to reconvene on Monday, Sirisena appears faced with the choice of either reappointing Wickremesinghe, whom he has said he will not bring back, or allowing the crisis to fester.
Rajapaksa's camp demanded an early election.
""We shall continue to agitate till an early election is called. We are thrown into anarchy,"" Rajapaksa loyalist Keheliya Rambukwella said, accusing Speaker Karu Jayasuriya of being biased and acting on behalf of Western nations.
Sirisena dissolved parliament last week and called elections, but the Supreme Court ordered a suspension of that decree on Tuesday until it had heard petitions challenging the move as unconstitutional.
BOOKS, BROKEN CHAIRS
Earlier on Friday, Rajapaksa supporters poured on to the floor of parliament, surrounding the speaker's chair, and demanded the arrest of two lawmakers from Wickremesinghe's party for allegedly bringing knives into the house on Thursday.
A member of parliament from Rajapaksa's Sri Lanka Podujana Peremuna party sat on Jayasuriya's chair surrounded by more than 20 lawmakers, delaying the start of proceedings. Rajapaksa loyalists then tried to prevent Jayasuriya from sitting on a second chair brought in by police.
One MP then pulled out the cushion of the second chair and hurled both towards policeman guarding the speaker.
When Jayasuriya eventually started calling out names while standing - under a heavy police presence for the first time in parliamentary history - to know whom MPs supported, Rajapaksa supporters bombarded him with books, chili paste and water bottles.
Three lawmakers and at least six police were injured, parliament medical staff said.
The speaker's office informed Sirisena in a letter that 122 MPs of the 225 lawmakers signed the no-confidence motion, the same margin as in Wednesday's first vote. 
Sirisena had called for the second vote after rejecting the first.
Sources close to the leadership have said Sirisena's decision to sack Wickremesinghe came after the prime minister's party rejected the president's request to back him for second five-year term in 2020. They also split over whether to back Chinese or Indian investors in various projects, the sources said.
India and Western countries have requested Sirisena act in line with the constitution while raising concerns over Rajapaksa's close ties with China. Beijing loaned Sri Lanka billions of dollars for infrastructure projects when Rajapaksa was president between 2005-2015.

Tourism accounts for nearly 5 percent of the economy and is a key main foreign exchange earner, along with the garment and tea industries, and remittances from Sri Lankans working abroad.

No group claimed responsibility for the triple bombing at the airport but Turkey maintains it was the work of Islamic State militants. It was one of several attacks blamed on the group in Turkey that year.
The six defendants were sentenced to life in prison without parole after they were found guilty of murder and of attempting to destroy Turkey's constitutional order, Anadolu said. 
A total of 46 people were tried over the attack on terror-related charges including membership of an armed terrorist organization and forming and running a terror group, the news agency said.

It did not give details of other verdicts and sentences handed to the defendants but said 16 of them were Russian nationals, while the others were Chechen, Tunisian, Egyptian, Algerian, Syrian and Turkish citizens.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish police detained 13 people including two prominent academics on Friday under an investigation into jailed rights activist Osman Kavala, accusing them of following him in a bid to unseat the government through mass protests in 2013.
Kavala, a well-known civil society leader, was jailed a year ago pending trial for trying to overthrow the government, a process which authorities say started with those demonstrations and culminated with an attempted coup in July 2016.
Police said those arrested on Friday were accused of working with Kavala to foment the May 2013 unrest, which began as demonstrations against urban development plans at Istanbul's Gezi Park and turned into nationwide anti-government protests.
At least 10 people died and thousands were injured in a government crackdown on the demonstrations, which at the time were the biggest ever staged against the government of Tayyip Erdogan, now president, then entering his second decade as prime minister.
Kavala was accused of attempting to use force to remove the government or prevent it from fulfilling its duties, the police said. Prosecutors ordered the arrest of 20 people in total accused of acting with him. The charge carries a life sentence. 
""The individual aimed to spread the Gezi Park incidents across Turkey and create an atmosphere of chaos and disorder in the country generally,"" Istanbul police said in a statement.
Human rights groups and European Parliament members have repeatedly called on NATO member Turkey to release Kavala. An indictment against him has not yet been issued.
On Friday, the European Union called for the immediate release of ""all those detained without due process"".
""Repeated detentions of critical voices and the continued widespread pressure on civil society representatives run counter to the Turkish government's declared commitment to human rights,"" the EU's foreign policy service said.
A lawyer for one of the suspects named the two academics detained on Friday as Turgut Tarhanli, dean of Istanbul Bilgi University's law faculty, and Bogazici University's Betul Tanbay, who was elected this year as vice president of the European Mathematical Society.
Among the detainees were also staff of Kavala's Anadolu Kultur organization, which is involved in promoting culture and rights, including board members Yigit Ekmekci and Hakan Altinay.
Turkish Bar Association Chairman Metin Feyzioglu said he was monitoring developments with concern.
""The violation of basic rights and freedoms by the hand of the judiciary must not be allowed,"" he said in a statement. ""All illegal practices which will harm Turkey in the international community must be brought to an end.""
""PROFESSIONAL PROTESTERS""
Police said the suspects had brought in professional protesters from abroad to fuel the Gezi Park protests and had lobbied in Europe to halt the import of tear gas used by police. 
Since the attempted putsch in July 2016, Turkey has jailed 77,000 people as they face trial, as well as suspending or dismissing 150,000 civil servants and military personnel and shutting down dozens of media outlets.
Police still frequently carry out operations targeting the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, accused by Ankara of orchestrating the July 2016 failed putsch.
Anadolu said on Friday that prosecutors issued an order for the arrest of 188 people, including 100 former air force personnel, over links to Gulen's network. So far 86 suspects have been detained in the operation.

1057,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>",Canada's Trudeau uses Trump card to attack main political rival,"By Steve Scherer
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Donald Trump is so unpopular in Canada that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is using the specter of the U.S. president to attack his conservative rival ahead of a national election set for next year. 
Trudeau, whose ruling Liberals have a 12-seat majority in the 338-seat parliament, calls Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer a climate change ""ideologue"" who stokes ""fear and division"" on immigration. 
Only 25 percent of Canadians have confidence in Trump, a fraction of the 83 percent garnered by former President Barack Obama two years ago, according to a Pew Research Center survey published last month.   
Trudeau and Trump have traded barbs. The U.S. president tweeted in June that the Canadian leader was ""very dishonest and weak"" and later threatened to impose tariffs on Canadian-made cars that he said would be the ""ruination"" of Canada's economy.
The Conservatives led in the polls in March, but the Liberals drew ahead in July after Trudeau's spat with Trump and now hold a one-point lead in the latest survey by Ipsos Public Affairs.
""It's political manna from heaven (for Trudeau) to have a fight with Donald Trump,"" said a source familiar with the thinking of the Conservative leadership. Party officials are concerned that comparisons with Trump could turn off supporters, the source said. 
Scheer, still relatively unknown to voters after taking over as party leader last year, is choosing his words carefully on issues like climate change and immigration, while Trudeau is attacking his rival's position on the environment as being tantamount to Trump's.
The U.S. government announced last year that it intended to formally withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate accord. Canada, a major oil and gas producer, remains committed to the agreement. 
    Trudeau, 46, portrays Scheer as someone - like Trump - who denies climate change is man-made. Polls show Canadians overwhelmingly agree climate change is real and must be tackled.
    Trudeau plans to tax carbon emissions, a measure which Scheer opposes on the grounds it will force ""suburban moms and dads"" to spend a lot more money on gas. [nL2N1X30XO]
Speaking in Ottawa's National Gallery in front of a wall-sized picture of an old-growth forest on Oct. 29, Trudeau said Scheer's criticism shows the Conservatives want to ""make pollution free again"".
    The phrase mimicking Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan has since been repeatedly used by Liberal ministers and legislators. 
Scheer, 39, does not deny climate change and has said he will present his own strategy to combat carbon emissions without raising taxes by the time Canadians are due to vote on Oct. 21, 2019.
    While the Conservative source said the attempts to link Scheer to Trump were calculated, an official close to Trudeau declined to comment.
    The official said Trudeau's characterization of Scheer's position on climate change is ""very factual.""
PRESSURE ON IMMIGRATION
Ipsos pollster Darrell Bricker said the Liberal strategy to paint Scheer as a northern Trump could work in the ruling party's favor given Canadians' ""very poor view"" of the U.S. leader.
Scheer is also under Liberal pressure on immigration. 
In July, the Conservative Party withdrew an ad that had been posted on its Twitter feed showing a black asylum seeker entering Canada through a broken fence while walking over the text of a 2017 Trudeau tweet that read: ""Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength.""
    The ad alleged that Trudeau's tweet lured thousands of people into Canada from the United States to file refugee claims. Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen said the Conservatives were ""peddling false information to stoke fear.""
    Canadians' view of Trump, who has adopted hard-line policies on immigration, was highlighted earlier this month when the mere presence of former Trump strategist Steve Bannon at a Toronto debate drew hundreds of protesters, resulting in 12 arrests. 

    The protesters ""were calling the audience fascists and taking their pictures and threatening to put them online,"" Bannon said in an interview. ""It was a tough audience. They hated Trump.""

LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal's bullfighting tradition has stirred a row inside the Socialist government after the new culture minister refused to cut value-added tax (VAT) on tickets to events in line with other cultural shows.
Many Portuguese back the practice, arguing that it is more humane than in neighboring Spain because bulls are not killed in the ring but rather after the fight, out of sight of spectators. Supporters also say the contests are less skewed in favor of the bullfighters, who are frequently gored in what they insist is an ancient cultural tradition. 
The government's 2019 draft budget, announced last month, included a measure to cut VAT on cultural events such as plays and the circus to six percent from 13 percent. But bullfights were left out, remaining at the higher level.
The head of the Socialists in parliament, Carlos Cesar, said on Thursday the party's lawmakers had agreed to add bullfights to the list of events, hitting back at Culture Minister Graca Fonseca's refusal.
""Now it's bullfighting, next it will be hunting and then it will be what book we can read or which movie we can watch,"" complained Manuel Alegre, a prominent Socialist who ran for president in 2011, adding that Fonseca's ""attitudes place democracy at risk.""
Fonseca refused to cut VAT on bullfights, saying: ""It is a matter of civilization.""
Prime Minister Antonio Costa waded into the debate, saying this week he was surprised by Cesar's move to change the draft budget, which promises to virtually eliminate the deficit.
Last week Costa addressed Alegre, writing in the Publico newspaper: ""I prefer to think that civilizations also distinguish themselves by the way they treat animals.""

Costa agreed with those who think bullfights are cruel but left it up to local councils to decide whether to ban them. Parliament rejected in June a bill to end bullfighting, with only eight Socialist backbenchers supporting it.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is defying U.S. calls to mend ties with Qatar despite signs that pressure to end another regional crisis, the Yemen war, has had an impact on Riyadh since the killing of a prominent journalist.
Jamal Khashoggi's murder at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 caused a global outcry, opened Saudi Arabia to the possibility of sanctions and damaged the image of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. 
Washington believes it has more influence over Riyadh as its ally tries to repair the damage to the kingdom's standing, and wants to use this leverage to end the Yemen war and rebuild Gulf unity against Iran, four sources familiar with the matter said.
On one front, there is movement.
In an apparent response to U.S. and British pressure for a ceasefire in Yemen by the end of this month, the Saudi-led coalition fighting Iran-aligned Houthi rebels halted an offensive on the main port city of Hodeidah on Thursday. 
Maintaining pressure on Riyadh, Washington imposed sanctions on 17 Saudi officials for their role in Khashoggi's killing later on Thursday, and U.S. senators introduced draft legislation which, if it became law, would suspend arms sales to Saudi Arabia over the journalist's death and the Yemen war.
Saudi authorities did not respond to requests for comment. A U.S. State Department spokeswoman said Washington had been calling for a resolution throughout the Qatar and Yemen crises.
""We continue to engage on both of these issues with our partners in the region, including Saudi Arabia,"" the spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, said. 
""Gulf unity is essential to our common interests of confronting Iran’s malign influence, countering terrorism, and ensuring a prosperous future for all of our Gulf partners.""
QATAR RIFT RUNS DEEP
The United States sees Saudi Arabia as a crucial player in the efforts to build unity in the Gulf to contain Iran's influence in the Middle East, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Riyadh soon after Khashoggi's killing. 
But Washington sees the Yemen war as a destabilizing factor in the region and wants an end to the conflict, which has killed more than 10,000 people and pushed Yemen to the brink of famine.
Saudi Arabia and its ally, the United Arab Emirates, also now have reasons to exit the war as it has proved costly and reached stalemate.
Since the death of Khashoggi, a Saudi national and U.S. resident who was critical of the Crown Prince, U.S. officials have also sought to sway Riyadh over its row with Qatar. 
Gulf unity, which Washington considers a bulwark against Iran, was shattered when Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt severed trade and transport ties in June 2017, accusing Doha of supporting terrorism and Iran -- charges Doha denies.
""They are seizing the opportunity to try to end the Qatar dispute,"" a source with knowledge of U.S. policy said.
Washington had wanted Gulf unity restored, to help contain Iran's influence in the region, before new sanctions went into force against Tehran over its nuclear program on Nov. 4, two of the sources said.
Western hopes that Riyadh might mend ties with Doha had been raised by a comment Prince Mohammed made on the strength of Qatar's economy at an investment forum on Oct. 25.
But diplomats and Gulf sources say they have seen no new ideas or concrete moves by Riyadh or its allies to end the row with tiny but wealthy Qatar.
""I don't see any change on Qatar. The crown prince's message was interpreted wrongly. He was sending a message to America ... 'Don't get worried about Qatar because you still have a strong economy in Qatar',"" one Arab diplomat told Reuters.
Each of the boycotting countries is an ally of Riyadh and has longstanding political and security differences with Qatar.
A Gulf source said Prince Mohammed, known as MbS, would avoid any move that could be interpreted as weakness as he tries to recover from the diplomatic fallout over Khashoggi.
Riyadh offered contradictory explanations for Khashoggi's disappearance before saying he was killed in a rogue operation. King Salman, who stepped in to defuse the crisis, has stood by his chosen heir, in whose hands he has concentrated power.
CONTAINING THE CRISIS
Kuwait said this month there was a ""positive view to contain the Gulf crisis,"" and a source familiar with U.S. policy said diplomats were putting forward a plan on Qatar.
But neither side seems ready to cede ground.
Qatar's foreign ministry spokeswoman said last month that Khashoggi's death should serve as a ""wake-up call"". Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker said on Tuesday he did not expect a thaw soon.
""I am very pessimistic about this. With the current (Saudi and UAE) leadership I don't see that there is any way that things may be loosened up,"" he told reporters. ""The only face-saving way for them to get out is to apologize.""
Abu Dhabi says the dispute is not a priority, according to three diplomats and other sources familiar with Gulf policy.
""The Qataris are raising the price for resolving the crisis,"" said one Western diplomat. ""The Emiratis are happy to keep the Qataris isolated.""
Qatar and UAE authorities did not respond to requests for comment.
Riyadh and Abu Dhabi continue to reassure Washington that the dispute will not deter the formation of a proposed Middle East security alliance, which would include Doha, diplomats said.
They said the UAE still strongly supports MbS against Iran and on his economic and social reforms, seen by Abu Dhabi as essential to replicating the UAE model of a business-friendly, tolerant Muslim society to combat extremism.

""The Emiratis see Saudi Arabia as the only choice to lead the region. They haven't blinked in their belief that Riyadh's reform plans are the best and only option,"" said Elizabeth Dickinson, Senior Analyst for the Arabian Peninsula at the International Crisis Group.

CARACAS (Reuters) - A socialist commune has drawn the ire of its neighbors in a wealthy area of Caracas with an unusual response to the hyperinflation and food shortages afflicting Venezuela: turning its backyard into an urban cattle pasture.
The leaders of the Apacuana commune, devotees of socialist President Nicolas Maduro, drove six hours to purchase 11 450-kilo (992-lb) cows. They set them to graze behind their 2,000-square meter (21,528 square-foot) home, donated by the state-owned telecommunications company two years ago. 
The government began transferring billions of dollars to a network of more than 70,000 such community groups under the administration of late President Hugo Chavez, who supported the communes as an alternative to a capitalist economic model. Maduro has called communes ""the epicenter of solidarity."" 
Leaders of the commune, who also grow fruits and vegetables, say the arrangement is simply a way to get cheaper meat. They do not graze the cattle for long, and have already slaughtered several inside their home. 
With Venezuela's oil-reliant economy in a fifth year of recession and inflation nearing 1 million percent, securing staple goods is a daily struggle for many. 
Just 40 percent of families can afford beef and nearly two-thirds of the population reported losing weight last year, by 11 kilos (24 lb) on average, according to a study by three universities.
Western economists and the domestic opposition blame Maduro's heavy-handed policies and economic mismanagement for the crisis. However, the government and its supporters attribute Venezuela's struggles to U.S. sanctions and hoarding by businesses trying to undermine socialism.
""This experience shows the resolve of the people to push back against the economic war,"" said commune leader Sulimar Pedrozar, as two cow heads boiled in a pot over a wood fire and a group cleaned out a cow stomach for a soup.
The group has slaughtered seven cows and sold a small amount of meat to several hundred people at 560 bolivars per kilo, or about $2 at the black market exchange rate.
That was well above the government-set price of 90 bolivars. But with supply scarce, many butchers in Caracas sell beef for more than 10 times that amount, or more than half a monthly salary at the official minimum wage.
In 2016, Maduro launched a ""Great Agro-Venezuela Mission"" to encourage city-dwellers to grow fruits, vegetables and herbs in their backyards, noting that he and his wife harvested pumpkins on their patio. Earlier this year, a government minister said people should breed and eat rabbits, arguing they are not just ""cute pets.""
On Thursday evening, several dozen neighbors of the commune gathered to protest the ranch next door, complaining about the foul smell, flies, and health risks. 
""It is the first time in my life I've seen cattle being raised in a house,"" said Luisa Ferro, a resident of the Los Chorros neighborhood. ""You see stuff like that in the country, but never in a city."" 
Pedro Méndez, a local opposition leader, said he would report the urban ranch to Venezuela's health ministry, but doubted the government would stop it given Maduro's support for such communes.
Pedroza said the commune would continue raising livestock. 

""There is resistance to this idea but those who want to let people die of hunger are crazier,"" Pedroza said.

Prosecutors say Berlusconi gave Gianpaolo Tarantini 500,000 euros ($570,000) in cash, found him a job and supplied him with lawyers to say that the then-premier did not know the women were being paid to attend parties at his villa.
The trial is due to start on Feb. 4 in the southern city of Bari. It is the latest in a long string of legal problems for the 82-year-old media tycoon since he entered politics 24 years ago.
After a four-year jail sentence for tax fraud in 2013, linked to his Mediaset television company, was converted into a year of community service, he was barred from public office and stripped of his seat in parliament. 
Berlusconi, who can now run for elections, has always denied wrongdoing in the case and has repeatedly accused prosecutors of conducting a political witch-hunt against him.
""We are relaxed that at the hearing president Berlusconi will be completely acquitted,"" his lawyers Nicolo Ghedini and Francesco Paolo Sisto said.
Berlusconi suffered a major political setback at national elections in March when his Forza Italia (Go Italy!) was only the fourth largest party and was overtaken by its traditionally junior coalition partner, the far-right League.
The League then formed a government with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, while Forza Italia went into opposition. It has continued to lose support and now has the backing of less than 10 percent of voters, according to opinion polls.

Earlier Netanyahu met with key coalition partner Naftali Bennett of the Jewish Home Party who had sought the post for himself, but the two men emerged without an agreement.
Netanyahu's right-wing coalition government was rocked by Lieberman's resignation on Wednesday in protest at a ceasefire reached between Israel and the Islamist group Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
After Bennett and Netanyahu's meeting, a spokesman for the PM's Likud Party said that for now Netanyahu would take over the defense portfolio himself.
The premier had called for ""every effort to preserve the right-wing government"" and to prevent the left from getting into power, the spokesman said. 
A source close to Bennett said that after his meeting with Netanyahu ""it became clear ... there was a need to go to elections as soon as possible with no possibility of continuing the current government.""
Israeli media reported that other coalition partners would oppose Bennett, who leads an ultra-nationalist, religious party, becoming defense minister. 
An early election date would be decided on Sunday, the source said.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Alice Weidel, co-leader of Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), on Friday accused media that uncovered evidence of large, unexplained donations to her party of seeking to discredit her.
The AfD, which is Germany's largest opposition party but suffered lackluster results in two regional elections last month, has been reeling since an investigative media consortium alleged Weidel's local party had received 130,000 euros ($147,251.00) from a Swiss firm in 2017.
The party later also said it had received 150,000 euros from a Belgian - later revealed to be a Dutch - foundation. The AfD returned both sums after concerns were raised about a lack of clarity over funding, party officials told German media.
The affair threatens to overshadow an AfD congress this weekend that some had seen as an opportunity for a relaunch after a difficult period for the anti-immigrant party.
Donations from non-German citizens living in non-EU countries such as Switzerland are illegal in Germany, while all gifts of more than 50,000 euros must be declared in a parliamentary register - something the AfD did not do for either the Swiss or the Dutch donations.
Weidel criticized the media treatment of her role.
""The accusations made against me regarding apparently illegal party donations are known to me only from the media,"" she said. ""They lack any basis in fact and are an attempt to discredit me personally and politically.""
She did not say which details in the media reports she was contesting, adding that she would not say anything further while a planned investigation by prosecutors was under way.
The AfD did not immediately respond to a request to clarify precisely what allegations she was rejecting in her statement.
PARLIAMENTARY IMMUNITY
Prosecutors have asked for Weidel's parliamentary immunity to be lifted, an indication that they wish to carry out a preliminary examination of the affair.
The party's other co-leader, Alexander Gauland, has so far stood by her, but the head of the party in her home state of Baden-Wuerttemberg told the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper she should resign if the donations turned out to have been illegal.
The party is holding a congress this weekend to choose its candidates for next year's European Parliament elections, the next major test of whether it has managed to recover the momentum that saw it burst into parliament with 13 percent of votes cast in last year's national election.
The AfD made little progress in elections in Bavaria and Hessen in October, which were both marked by surging support for the pro-immigration Greens, their ideological antithesis.

KABUL (Reuters) - The U.S. special envoy for Afghanistan is trying to reassure the U.S.-backed government in Kabul that it will not be shut out of a peace process with the Taliban, after it complained of being side-lined from talks, officials said on Friday.
The U.S. envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, wants representatives of Afghan society to join talks aimed at ending the 17-year war between the Western-backed government and the Islamist Taliban, who were ousted from power by U.S.-led forces in 2001.
Khalilzad, an Afghan-born U.S. diplomat, met Taliban leaders in Qatar last month to try to push talks forward but the Taliban have long rejected direct talks with the elected government, led by President Ashraf Ghani.
""Ghani and many Afghan politicians felt that the U.S. was shutting them out of the peace talks,"" said a close aide to Ghani.
""Khalilzad cleared the differences by meeting top Afghan politicians, civil society members and women to prove that U.S. will not isolate Afghans during next round of peace talks,"" he said.
Ghani's office declined to comment.
The Taliban are fighting to expel foreign forces and defeat the Western-backed government.
The United States has for years resisted getting involved in direct talks with the militants, saying the process must be ""Afghan-owned and Afghan-led"".
The Taliban last month presented demands to Khalilzad that included a timeline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops and the release of senior Taliban from jails in Afghanistan and Pakistan. 
In October, Pakistan released one of the co-founders of the Taliban and another high-ranking commander.
No date has been announced for another round of talks but the Taliban have stepped up their attacks on government forces, inflicting hundreds of casualties over recent weeks in assaults in different parts of the country.
A senior government official in Kabul said Khalilzad wanted Afghan society represented in talks.
""Ambassador Khalilzad met men and women from all walks of the Afghan society to bring them together as a stakeholder in talks with the Taliban,"" the government official said.
The emphasis on ""Afghan society"" appeared aimed at persuading the Taliban to accept an Afghan delegation that does not officially represent the government.
Two Taliban officials in Afghanistan said they would continue engagement with Khalilzad, but would not say if their leaders would accept an Afghan delegation.

""We're watching every diplomatic move of the U.S. officials. We'll continue our fight until the U.S. accepts our demands,"" said Zabiullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman.

1066,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2018 06:55AM ET</span>","India's Modi embraces Maldives as new leader takes office, China out of favor","By Sanjeev Miglani and Mohamed Junayd
MALE (Reuters) - Maldives' President-elect Ibrahim Mohamed Solih takes office on Saturday, seeking help from India and the United States to climb out from under a mountain of Chinese debt that his predecessor racked up in a breakneck development of the coral islands.
The surprise defeat of pro-China strongman Abdulla Yameen has opened a window for India, the strategic outpost's traditional political partner, to regain ground lost to Beijing in their tussle for regional dominance.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be the highest ranking visitor at the inauguration at the national soccer stadium in the capital Male. By contrast, China's highest-ranking attendee will be Culture and Tourism Minister Luo Shugang.
Modi's presence signals the end of years of frosty relations because of Yameen's embrace of China, a relationship that had deepened India's anxieties about being encircled by countries leaning towards Beijing.
In Sri Lanka, an island nation to the southeast of India, the rivalry between New Delhi and Beijing has been one of the triggers for a political crisis in recent weeks.
""INDIA-FIRST""
The low-key Solih, a veteran lawmaker, has promised an ""India first"" policy in the Maldives, saying the small nation of a little over 400,000 people needs solid ties with its immediate neighbor.
His team is also reviewing millions of dollars of investments from China, as well as the related debt that the country has run up from Chinese lenders and how to restructure it. Solih has said investigations will be launched to find out what happened and fix accountability, Adam Azim, a member of his transition committee, told reporters on Thursday.
""We were led to believe it's about $1.5 billion, the Chinese debt, but it could be worse,"" said another member of Solih's top economic team, which has been holding discussions with finance ministry officials during the transition following the election in September.
He said the team had already reached out to India, the United States and Saudi Arabia for financial assistance so it could tackle the debt. 
""We straightaway need 200-300 million dollars to kick start the budgetary support,"" the adviser said.
Debt of $1.5 billion would be more than a quarter of the country's annual gross domestic product. Another member of the incoming president's economic team said firm proposals for assistance had been discussed with Indian and U.S. officials. 
""FRIENDSHIP"" BRIDGE
Signs of the infrastructure boom are everywhere in Male, from where tourists are whisked off in high speed boats to luxury resorts built on atolls in the turquoise waters. 
Some 400 Chinese workers this year completed the mile-long China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, which towers over the city connecting the airport on one island to the capital on another.
The airport itself is undergoing expansion, with a second runway to accommodate the thousands of tourists who arrive each day.
The airport development is an especially sore point with India, after the Maldivian government canceled a $511 million deal with India's GMR Infrastructure and later gave the contract to Beijing Urban Construction Group Company Limited.
The Yameen administration also threw open new islands and lagoons from the 1,192 islands that make up the necklace-shaped archipelago for development of resorts.
""There is such secrecy surrounding all these deals that it will take us weeks to figure out what went on,"" said Mariya Ahmad, an MP and spokeswoman for Solih. 
Sensing an opportunity, India has told Solih's team it stands ready to help, Indian government officials in New Delhi and Maldivian authorities in Male said. 
India had provided a $75 million credit line some years ago, of which a third had been utilized before the diplomatic chill set in with the previous administration, an Indian government official said. 
There is also a currency swap agreement between the Reserve Bank of India and the Maldives Monetary Authority that could help maintain financial stability, the official said. 
Modi, making his first visit since taking office in 2014, will hold talks with Solih before the inauguration. 
India has had a long standing defense cooperation agreement with the Maldives, providing coastal security and patrols of its exclusive economic zone. But Yameen saw such co-operation as a cover for surveillance and had asked India to withdraw two military helicopters along with 50 military personnel this year. 
The Indians had refused and now officials in Delhi said they expected the visas of the personnel involved in the operations to be renewed.
""In keeping with its neighborhood first policy, India looks forward to closely working with Maldives in further deepening the partnership,"" Indian foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar said.
A diplomatic source said the United States was also set to increase its engagement with the Maldives. Its relations had also become strained because of Yameen's crackdown on political rivals and supreme court justices.
But China remains a big player, given the investments by its state companies and as Chinese tourists pour in. That means the relationship is unlikely to completely unravel.
Between January to October this year, 247,911 Chinese tourists arrived, accounting for a fifth of all visitors. India, which is much closer geographically, provided just 5 percent.
China's embassy did not respond to a request for comment about concerns that its projects had pushed the Maldives into financial difficulties. Soon after Solih's victory, Beijing had said it hoped the new government would maintain continuity in its policies and create good conditions for Chinese firms.

Golan resolution, wins Israeli praise","JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The United States said it would oppose on Friday for the first time an annual resolution at the United Nations calling on Israel to rescind its authority in the occupied Golan Heights, drawing praise from Israeli officials.
The Golan Heights form a buffer between Israel and Syria of about 1,200 square km (460 square miles). Israel captured most of it from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war. It annexed the territory in 1981, a move not recognized internationally. 
The United States has abstained in previous years on the annual ""Occupied Syrian Golan"" resolution, which declares Israel's decision to impose its jurisdiction in the area ""null and void"", but Washington's U.N. envoy Nikki Haley said it would vote against the resolution in Friday's vote.
""The United States will no longer abstain when the United Nations engages in its useless annual vote on the Golan Heights,"" she said in a statement on Thursday.
""The resolution is plainly biased against Israel. Further, the atrocities the Syrian regime continues to commit prove its lack of fitness to govern anyone.""
Her comments came after the U.S. ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, said in September that he expected Israel to keep the Golan Heights in perpetuity, in an apparent nod towards its claim of sovereignty over the territory.
Since early in Donald Trump's presidency, Israel has lobbied for formal U.S. endorsement of its control of the Golan. Trump has recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, breaking with other world powers, though his national security adviser John Bolton told Reuters in August a similar Golan move was not under discussion.
In the past two years, Trump has twice ordered U.S.-led air strikes against targets in Syria in response to what Washington called the use of chemical weapons against civilians by President Bashar al-Assad's forces.
Israeli officials praised the U.S. move.
Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan called it ""extremely important"", saying on Twitter that ""no sane person can believe that it (the Golan) should be given to Assad & Iran"".
Tehran has supported Assad during the civil war and Israel has been warning against Iranian military entrenchment in Syria.

Israel has closely monitored the fighting in Syria, where just across the Golan frontier battles have raged in clear view.

PORT MORESBY (Reuters) - President Xi Jinping made a push to expand China's influence in the Pacific on Friday, holding a forum with leaders of eight small island countries in Papua New Guinea.
But Chinese officials barred most media, including reporters from the Pacific, from the forum at which Xi met leaders from the Cook Islands, Fiji, Micronesia, Niue, Samoa, Tonga, Vanuatu, as well as Papua New Guinea, in its capital Port Moresby ahead of an APEC summit this weekend.
China's efforts to win friends in the resource-rich Pacific push have been watched warily by the traditionally influential powers in the region - Australia, New Zealand and the United States - who were not invited to Friday's forum.
But to the disappointment of many of the journalists there to report on China's role in the region, Chinese officials barred access to all media, apart from a small list of outlets, citing space and security concerns.
Many of those left out grumbled about what they saw as a lack of transparency around China's efforts to gain new allies.
""It just sends such a terrible signal,"" said Jonathan Pryke of Sydney-based think-tank the Lowy Institute. 
""It just seems like they are trying to buy influence but not build influence,"" he said, referring to Chinese aid to the region.
Dozens of accredited journalists were turned away despite being invited to attend by PNG officials, who also arranged transport to the well-guarded forum venue.
Chinese officials said they had not been informed of the host's plans and had to limit media numbers.
One official suggested journalists could look out for reports on the forum published by China's state-run news agency Xinhua.
Lina Keapu, photojournalist at PNG's Sunday Chronicle newspaper said it was a ""slap in the face"".
""As the local media, we should be there covering it and getting the news to our national public,"" she said. 
Pita Ligaiula, a journalist with the Pacific Island News Association, based in Fiji, said Chinese influence was among the big issues affecting the region and it was important to be able to inform the public about its intentions.
""I come all the way from Fiji only to be told we are not invited to cover this,"" he said.
China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 

Pryke said China had scored an ""own goal"" by ""marginalising domestic media in their own country"" when they could have anticipated plenty of positive coverage from the event.

1071,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2018 05:47AM ET</span>","Myanmar holds 106 Rohingya aboard boat to Malaysia, official says","By Shoon Naing and Simon Lewis
KYAUKTAN, Myanmar (Reuters) - Myanmar immigration authorities detained 106 Rohingya Muslims aboard a boat off Yangon on Friday, officials said, raising fears of a fresh wave of dangerous voyages after a 2015 crackdown on people smugglers.
The boat was bound for Malaysia when authorities stopped it in the early morning some 30 km (20 miles) south of Myanmar's largest city, Kyaw Htay, an immigration officer from Kyauktan township, told Reuters by phone.
The group boarded the vessel from internal displacement camps outside Sittwe, the capital of western Rakhine state, he said. 
""Their destination was Malaysia. The boat was stopped after the engine failed,"" he said.
Tens of thousands of Rohingya have been confined to sprawling camps outside Sittwe since violence swept Rakhine in 2012.
More than 700,000 Rohingya fled a brutal army crackdown in the northern part of the state last year, according to U.N. agencies. The Rohingya say soldiers and local Buddhists massacred families, burned hundreds of villages, and carried out gang rapes. U.N.-mandated investigators have accused the Myanmar army of ""genocidal intent"" and ethnic cleansing.
Myanmar denies almost all of the allegations, saying security forces were battling terrorists. Attacks by Rohingya insurgents calling themselves the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army preceded the crackdown.
Officials say they are ready to accept Rohingya who want to return from Bangladeshi refugee camps. But on Thursday, efforts to repatriate several thousand failed after refugees protested, saying they did not want to return. U.N. officials and aid agencies opposed the plan, saying conditions in Myanmar were not safe.
Officials and aid workers told Reuters last week that dozens of Rohingya in Myanmar and Bangladesh had boarded boats to try to reach Malaysia in recent weeks after the end of the monsoon rains in early October. 
RICKETY BOATS
Those who arrived on Friday were questioned on the top floor of a cyclone shelter, where women wearing headscarves, men, and children could be seen through the windows by Reuters reporters. 
They were led to trucks as a phalanx of officials stood guard, women leading small children by the hand and some carrying small bags, before being driven away towards Yangon.
In a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post, Aye Mya Mya Myo, a lower house lawmaker for Aung San Suu Kyi's ruling National League for Democracy party from Kyauktan, said there were 50 men, 31 women and 25 children in the group.
Early on Friday she posted pictures of a rickety boat crammed with people. It resembled vessels the Rohingya typically use to escape the apartheid-like conditions in Rakhine, where they are denied free movement and access to decent education and healthcare.
For years, Rohingya on both sides of the border have boarded boats organized by smugglers in the dry months between November and March, when the sea is calm. The perilous journey to Thailand and Malaysia, often undertaken in overcrowded vessels, has cost many lives.

Thailand cracked down on the trade after discovering a series of mass graves in 2015, leading to a crisis when smugglers abandoned their human cargo and left boats adrift in the Andaman Sea.

Intan Indah Syari had been due to marry her high-school sweetheart, Rio Nanda Pratama, who was a doctor, on November 11.
Photographs of Syari wearing her white wedding dress, alone, on the day of their planned ceremony went viral on social media with thousands of likes and an outpouring of sympathetic comments from around the world. 
""I want him, now that he is on the other side, to know that I'm happy. This was to pay him my last respects,"" Syari said, explaining her decision to wear the dress and how her fiance's last wish had been to see photos of her in the gown. 
""We had been waiting for this moment for 13 years, including six years in a long distance relationship, but at the end I lost my fiance,"" she told Reuters, speaking softly.  
Syari said she had kept calling his mobile phone on the days immediately after the Oct. 29 crash, clinging to a faint hope that he might be still alive.
His body was later identified and search officials found his shoes, as well as a bag and paperwork belonging to him. 
Indonesian investigators are due to publish a preliminary report on the crash later this month in a bid to explain why the nearly new Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 MAX jet slammed violently into the sea during clear weather.
Pratama's father has filed a U.S. lawsuit against Boeing, alleging it did not adequately warn Lion Air or its pilots of an unsafe design condition. Boeing is headquartered in Illinois. [nL2N1XQ1XK]
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) warned airlines last week that erroneous inputs from the system’s sensors could lead the jet to automatically pitch its nose down even when autopilot is turned off, making it difficult for pilots to control.
Urging regulators to prevent any recurrence of such a crash, Syari said that all her hopes and dreams had been shattered.

""Please improve the regulation of the aviation industry, in terms of safety and inspections, before a flight takes off,"" she said. ""If a flight is not fit to fly, please do not let it leave.""

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - A U.N.-backed court found two leaders of Cambodia's Khmer Rouge guilty of genocide on Friday, almost four decades after the ultra-Maoist regime which oversaw the ""Killing Fields"" was overthrown.
Most of the victims of the 1975-79 regime died of starvation, torture, exhaustion or disease in labor camps or were bludgeoned to death during mass executions.
Between 1.7 and 2.2 million people, almost a quarter of the population, died during the 1975 to 1979 rule of the Khmer Rouge.
The Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC), said Khmer Rouge ""Brother Number Two"", Nuon Chea, 92, and former President Khieu Samphan, 87, were guilty of genocide against the Cham Muslim minority and Vietnamese people, and of various crimes against humanity.
The court sentenced them to life in prison.
Both men denied the charges.
They were already serving life sentences for 2014 convictions for crimes against humanity, in connection with the forced evacuation of the capital Phnom Penh after they took power under their notorious leader Pol Pot in 1975.
There had been debate for years among legal experts at to whether the killings by the Khmer Rouge constituted genocide, as by far the majority of their victims were fellow Cambodians.
The court found that during their rule, the Khmer Rouge had a policy to target Cham and Vietnamese people to create ""an atheistic and homogenous society without class divisions"", Judge Nil Nonn said in the verdict.
Genocide was committed against the Cham, Vietnamese and Buddhists, he said.
The Cham ""were dispersed and scattered among Khmer villages for their communities to be broken up and fully assimilated into the Cambodian population"", Nil Nonn said. 
""A great number of Cham civilians were taken ... and were thus killed on a massive scale,"" he said.
Hundreds of Vietnamese civilians and soldiers were killed at the S-21 interrogation center, at a converted Phnom Penh school called Tuol Sleng, after being tortured to admit being spies.
""All Vietnamese soldiers and civilians who entered S-21 were labeled as spies and considered enemies,"" Nil Nonn said. ""The fate of these prisoners was a foregone conclusion as they were all ultimately subject to execution.""
'COLLECTIVE HUMANITY'
Both Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea appeared for the court session but Nuon Chea left after about 40 minutes because of back pain, the court was told. He followed the proceeding on a link from his cell.
Khieu Samphan, looking frail and gaunt, stood in the dock with the help of prison guards when Nil Nonn read the verdict.
The court, a hybrid U.N.-Cambodian tribunal, was set up in 2005 to bring to justice ""those most responsible"" for the deaths under the Khmer Rouge, has convicted just three people.
Its first conviction was in 2010 when it sentenced Kaing Guek Eav, alias ""Duch"", head of S-21 where as many as 14,000 people were tortured and executed, to life in prison.
Two other Khmer Rouge leaders, Ta Mok and Ieng Sary, were facing charges but died before the case was concluded. Pol Pot died in 1998.
Youk Chhang, director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia (DC-CAM), the country's main research center into the Khmer Rouge atrocities, welcomed the verdict and said it was particularly significant for the minority communities.
""It will affirm the collective humanity of the victims and give recognition to the horrible suffering that they suffered,"" Youk Chhang told Reuters. 
But he said for most Cambodians, the important thing was not the particular charge of genocide, but the affirmation of the punishment.
""What matters most for them is that the Khmer Rouge, who took away millions of people's lives, are in prison for life.""
The court, which has been plagued by political interference, is not expected to hear any more cases.
Prime Minister Hun Sen, himself a former Khmer Rouge guerrilla who defected to the regime's eventual conquerors, Vietnam, said he would ""not allow"" any new indictments beyond the handful of top leaders.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea will deport a U.S. citizen detained since October after he entered illegally from China and told his captors he was manipulated by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the North Korean state news agency reported on Friday.
The KCNA news agency identified the American as Bruce Byron Lowrance and said he was detained on Oct. 16 as he crossed the border. 
An American man of the same name was deported from South Korea in November 2017 after being found wandering near the heavily fortified border with North Korea, but there was no immediate confirmation of the identity of the man held by North Korea.
A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in the South Korean capital, Seoul, said he could not comment because of privacy concerns, and would not confirm whether American officials were aware that the man was being held.
Using the initials of North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, KCNA said the man had told his captors ""he illegally entered the DPRK under the manipulation of the CIA"".
North Korea's treatment of U.S. citizens has been highly contentious at times over the years, sometimes holding them as prisoners for extended periods.
In 2017, the death of American student Otto Warmbier after having been detained in North Korea for 17 months helped spark nearly a year of tension as Pyongyang and Washington traded threats of war.
In September 2017, the United States imposed a ban on its citizens traveling to North Korea, with a few exceptions for humanitarian workers or journalists.
In May, North Korea released three American prisoners and handed them over to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, clearing a major obstacle ahead of an unprecedented summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June.
Talks between North Korea and the United States have since stalled, with North Korean state media announcing on Friday that Kim had inspected the test of an unidentified new weapon for the first time in almost a year.

The step marks a new low in relations between Hungary and the U.N., which Budapest has accused of spreading lies about the country and harboring a pro-immigration bias.
""UN human rights experts have taken the unprecedented step of suspending an official visit to Hungary after they were denied access to the Roszke and Tompa 'transit zones' at the border with Serbia,"" it said in a statement on Thursday.
The Hungarian government did not immediately comment.
Hungary, which lies on the southeastern edge of the European Union, has taken a hardline stand on immigration under right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
His government fortified its southern border with a razor wire fence in the wake of the 2015 migrant crisis, when more than a million immigrants arrived in Europe, hundreds of thousands transiting Hungary.
Budapest subsequently began taking any new arrivals into custody at container camps set up at two border crossings while their asylum claims are pending.
""We have received a number of credible reports concerning the lack of safeguards against arbitrary detention in these facilities which called for a visit,"" said Elina Steinerte and Setondji Roland Adjovi, members of the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. 
The European Court of Human Rights stepped in earlier this year when Hungary was found to have been refusing food to some asylum seekers at the two camps on the Serbian border.
""Unimpeded access to all places of deprivation of liberty including these transit zones must be guaranteed to independent international, regional and national organizations,"" the experts said. ""This is vital for the protection of the human rights in a country governed by rule of law.""
The U.N. also cited an international agreement that guarantees access to any detained persons for its experts.

Hungary rejects asylum applications from migrants arriving via safe countries. It was also the first European country to quit a U.N. agreement which aims to make migration safe and orderly amid issues of national sovereignty and international cooperation, following a similar decision by the United States last year.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea's leader publicly inspected a new weapon for the first time in nearly a year, state media reported on Friday, while it also decided to release a U.S. prisoner, sending conflicting signals at a time of sensitive negotiations.
Kim Jong Un's visit to the test site of a new ""tactical weapon"" threatened to sour the diplomatic atmosphere as negotiations between his country and the United States appear to have stalled. 
""This result today is a justification of the party's policy focused on defense science and technology, another display of our rapidly growing defense capabilities to the whole region, and a groundbreaking change in strengthening our military's combat capabilities,"" Kim said.
In Washington, in response to the North Korean announcement, a U.S. State Department spokesman said, ""We remain confident that the promises made by President Trump and Chairman Kim will be fulfilled."" 
The official was referring to an unprecedented summit in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim in Singapore, where they agreed to work toward denuclearization and peace on the Korean peninsula, and establish new relations.
But the agreement was short on specifics, and negotiations have made little headway since.
In a possibly conciliatory gesture, however, North Korea also announced on Friday it was releasing an American citizen detained since October after ""illegally"" entering North Korea from China.
North Korea has often held previous American detainees for more extended periods.
'STEEL WALL'
The military test was successful and the weapon could protect North Korea like a ""steel wall"", its KCNA news agency said, adding that Kim had observed ""the power of the tactical weapon"".
The only picture released by state media showed Kim standing on a beach surrounded by officials in military uniforms, but no weapons were visible.
International weapons experts said the officials around Kim included a leader of the artillery corps of the Korean People's Army.
South Korea's defense ministry said it did not have an immediate comment but was analyzing the North Korean weapon test.
Friday's understated announcement was more likely aimed at reassuring the North Korean military rather than trying to torpedo diplomatic talks, however, said Choi Kang, vice president of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul.
""North Korea is trying to show its soldiers that they are becoming high-tech and keeping a certain level of military capability, while trying to eliminate dissatisfaction and worries inside its military,"" he added.
The test may also have been a response to recent joint military drills by the United States and South Korea, which North Korea said violated recent pacts to halt to ""all hostile acts"", said Yang Uk, an analyst at the Korea Defence and Security Forum.
Kim said the weapons system tested was one in which his father, Kim Jong Il, had taken a special interest during his life, personally leading its development. 
Kim's last publicized military inspection was the launch of the Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on Nov. 29 last year, though he engaged in at least eight other military related activities this year, the South's Unification Ministry said.
STALLED TALKS
Kim this year declared his nuclear force ""complete"" and said he would focus on economic development.
North Korea has continued to showcase its conventional military capabilities, including at a large military parade in its capital, Pyongyang, on Sept. 9.
But any testing of new weapons threatens to raise tension with Washington, which has said there will be no easing in international sanctions until North Korea takes more concrete steps to abandon its nuclear weapons or long-range missiles.
North Korea has increasingly expressed frustration at Washington's refusal to ease sanctions, and recently threatened to restart development of its nuclear weapons if more concessions were not made.
""They’re trying to signal that they are willing to walk away from talks and restart weapons testing,"" said Adam Mount of the Federation of American Scientists. ""It is the most explicit in a series of escalating statements designed to send this message."" 
A meeting in New York planned this month between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and North Korea's Kim Yong Chol, a senior aide to Kim, was postponed.

On Thursday, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said Trump planned to meet Kim again in 2019 and will push for a concrete plan outlining Pyongyang's moves to end its arms programs.

Abe and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison laid wreaths at Darwin's Cenotaph war memorial before observing a minute's silence to acknowledge war dead and strengthen a bond that has evolved in the decades since.
""We acknowledge our history and we commemorate our sacrifice and loss today, but importantly, we have further strengthened our great relationship as good friends and great partners,"" Morrison said. 
""We acknowledge the special strategic relationship based not only on our deep shared values and interests but our deeply held beliefs.""
The leaders of both nations reaffirmed their strategic bond, and pledged to invest in infrastructure in the Pacific and south of the subcontinent, in a counter to the growing influence of China which has stepped up lending as part of its Belt and Road policy.
The leaders also underlined their commitment to free trade and to denuclearize the Korean peninsula as they commemorated soldiers lost in battle. 
""I extended my condolences in honor of all the fallen soldiers, and renew my bow toward peace,"" Abe said. 
""Thanks to the devoted efforts of many, Japan and Australia have achieved reconciliation, and have become special strategic partners.""
Two months after the Japanese attack on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Japanese air forces began bombing the northern Australian port city, the first time the global conflict reached Australian soil.
The first two raids on Feb. 19, 1942, killed about 250 people, according to the Australian War Memorial. Ships, aircraft, and civil and military facilities were destroyed.
There were a further 62 Japanese raids up to November 1943, but the War Memorial said none was as heavy as the first two, and most caused no damage or casualties.
Abe's visit also marks the start of exports from the $40 billion Ichthys gas project, one of Japan's biggest ever foreign investments. 
Ties between Australia and Japan have improved steadily since the 1950s, including a 2007 ""joint security pact"" on coordination on matters dealing with maritime and aviation safety.

A $13.5-trillion regional free trade agreement between Australia, Japan and nine other countries takes effect next month.

KOCHI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Thousands of protesters blocked all the exits at a southern Indian airport on Friday to stop a women's rights activist from heading to a Hindu temple to defy a centuries-old ban on the entry of women of menstruating age.
Widespread protests broke out in the tourist resort state of Kerala after the Supreme Court in September ordered authorities to lift a ban on women or girls aged between 10 and 50 from entering the temple, which draws millions of worshippers a year.
The activist, Trupti Desai, who arrived with a group of women at Kerala's biggest and busiest airport in the city of Kochi, at 4.30 a.m. (2230 GMT), has been held up for hours by the demonstrators.
Desai said police had advised her group not to leave the airport because of safety concerns, but vowed not to abandon plans to enter Sabarimala, the hill temple about 155 km (96 miles) away that is at the center of the conflict, on Saturday.
""Protests are being held outside the airport and the police have said that we can't go outside now,"" she told Reuters. ""We booked taxis three or four times, but drivers said they were threatened their vehicles would be vandalized if they offer us a ride.""
Desai, who led the ""Right to Pray"" movement in the western state of Maharashtra, had successfully fought to earn women the right to enter the inner sanctums of three temples there.
""We won't return until we have darshan,"" Desai said, referring to the opportunity to view the image of a deity.
""This kind of bullying and hooliganism are unacceptable."" 
At one stage, police tried to take the women through a cargo gate, but protesters foiled the attempt.
""We will not let activists go inside Sabarimala. We are willing to die protesting, but will not move an inch from here,"" one of the women protesters told television channel CNN NEWS18.
Thousands of demonstrators have protested against the court's decision, and conservative Hindu groups prevented about a dozen young women from entering the temple last month.
The groups say they believe allowing women who could be menstruating into the temple defiles the sacred shrine and they have asked the court to reconsider its decision.
The court has set Jan. 22 to hear nearly 50 petitions seeking reimposition of the ban. Until then, its earlier ruling allowing women entry stays in force, it said.
As a result, the state government, run by the Communist Party of India, and legally bound to follow the court, finds itself at loggerheads with devotees and opposition parties who want the ban to continue until the court review.
Separate meetings between Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, opposition political parties and the temple administration on Thursday failed to resolve the impasse.
Vijayan made clear that while his government respected the feelings of worshippers, it had to obey the court.

The hillside temple, nestled in a forest in the Western Ghats mountain range, will reopen at 5 p.m. (1130 GMT) on Friday for more than two months, with a three-day break in December.

The United States has conducted a series of ""freedom of navigation"" exercises in the contested South China Sea, angering China, which says the patrols threaten its sovereignty.
""The South China Sea doesn't belong to any one nation, and you can be sure: The United States will continue to sail and fly wherever international law allows and our national interests demand,"" Pence said.
China, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Taiwan, all have claims in the South China Sea, through which some $3 trillion of shipborne trade passes each year.
Pence on Thursday told leaders of Southeast Asian nations there was no place for ""empire and aggression"" in the Indo-Pacific region, a comment that could be interpreted as a reference to China's rise.
Speaking to a regional summit, Pence directly criticized China's action in the South China Sea, according to a transcript of his remarks. 
""Let me be clear: China's militarization and territorial expansion in the South China Sea is illegal and dangerous. It threatens the sovereignty of many nations and endangers the prosperity of the world,"" he said.
In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said no country, including the United States, had ever provided any evidence of problems with freedom of navigation or overflight in the South China Sea. 
""May I trouble you to remind Mr Pence, that the United States has yet to ratify the United Nations Law of the Sea Convention (UNCLOS),"" Hua told a daily news briefing. 
""If the United States can at an early date ratify and abide by UNCLOS, then I think this will benefit even more the protection of peace and stability in the South China Sea area.""
The 1982 convention defines how coastal states are allowed to establish sovereignty over territorial seas and exclusive economic zones. China has signed and ratified it. 

Pence's comments follow a major speech in October in which he flagged a tougher U.S. approach toward China, accusing it of ""malign"" efforts to undermine U.S. President Donald Trump and reckless military actions in the South China Sea.

1081,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2018 03:35AM ET</span>",North Korean official in South demands Japan compensate for war crimes,"By Joyce Lee and Jeongmin Kim
GOYANG, South Korea (Reuters) - A North Korean delegation called on Japan on Friday to pay ""sufficient compensation"" for the forced labor and conscription of the ""Korean people"" during World War Two and other Asia-Pacific conflicts.
In a rare visit to South Korea, North Korean delegation leader Ri Jong Hyok denounced ""crimes that violated human rights"", calling on Japan to ""make public its forced abduction of Koreans"" and give sufficient compensation, following the example of post-war Germany. 
Japan, South Korea and North Korea share a bitter history that includes Japan’s 1910-45 colonization of the Korean peninsula and the use of comfort women, Japan’s euphemism for girls and women forced to work in its wartime brothels. 
With North and South Korea experiencing a year of warming ties, experts say the North could be using a recent row between Seoul and Tokyo to make fresh demands on Japan.
However, experts also warn that any further deterioration in relations between Japan and South Korea could spill over into efforts to rein in North Korea's nuclear program. 
The dispute between South Korea and Japan was triggered by a South Korean Supreme Court ruling in October that Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp pay 100 million won ($87,700) to each of four South Korean steel workers for their forced labor during World War Two. 
Japan has denounced the verdict as ""unthinkable"" and said the matter had been ""completely and finally"" settled by a 1965 treaty.
""Although a ruling came out from the South side's court some time ago about forced conscription of Koreans, Japan is claiming that it is not for them to compensate,"" Ri said, addressing about 300 attendees at a convention in Goyang, northwest of Seoul. 
""We, the entire Korean people, strongly demand Japan's sincere and frank reflection, apology, and sufficient compensation.""
North Korean state media brought up Japan's forced labor issue on Tuesday, Wednesday and again on Friday. 
Unlike South Korea, North Korea never signed a treaty with Japan dealing with compensation.
The two countries have been discussing the issue since 1991 but the matter is not settled, legal and international relations experts said. 
In 2002 in a joint statement by North Korea and Japan, Tokyo acknowledged causing ""tremendous damage and suffering to the people of Korea through its colonial rule in the past, and expressed deep remorse and heartfelt apology"".
Tokyo says ties cannot be normalized until the three issues of the abduction of Japanese citizens, missiles and nuclear weapons are comprehensively resolved.
""The Japanese authorities are not only avoiding the settlement of past crimes, but are clamoring about some abduction of ordinary people issue which is the pot calling the kettle black,"" Ri said.
Jin Chang-soo, research fellow in Sejong Institute and expert on South Korea-Japan relations, said the South Korea-Japan relationship will be ""most influenced"" by how South Korea reacts. 

""If mistrust within Japan grows toward South Korea, there's a strong chance that bilateral relations and matters of defense, especially its stance about North Korea's nuclear issue, could be affected as well,"" he said.

NBC News reported on Thursday that the Trump administration was exploring ways to remove cleric Fethullah Gulen and persuade President Tayyip Erdogan to ease pressure on Saudi Arabia over the killing. The White House said the story was ""not accurate"".
A senior Turkish official said the issues of Gulen's extradition, which Turkey has long sought, and the investigation into who was behind Khashoggi's killing at Saudi Arabia's Istanbul consulate last month, were separate issues.
""At no point did Turkey offer to hold back on the Khashoggi investigation in return for Fethullah Gulen's extradition,"" the official said. ""We have no intention to intervene in the Khashoggi investigation in return for any political or legal favor.""
Erdogan has said the order for Khashoggi's killing came from the highest levels of the Saudi leadership. Washington on Thursday announced sanctions over the killings, targeting 17 Saudi officials but not the Riyadh government - an important U.S. security and economic ally.
Some Saudi commentators pointed to the NBC report as evidence that Turkey was trying to use Khashoggi's killing for political gain.
""I never had any doubt that Turkey was trading with the blood of Jamal Khashoggi,"" Abdulrahman al-Rashed, a prominent Saudi columnist, wrote on Twitter. 

Erdogan has long demanded that Washington extradite Gulen, who denies any involvement in the attempted coup and has lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since 1999. U.S. officials have said the courts need sufficient evidence to extradite the elderly cleric.

PORT MORESBY (Reuters) - The governor of Papua New Guinea's Manus Island said on Friday he had not been consulted on a navy base to be built with Australian help, hinting he could obstruct the port which is seen as an Australian bid to protect its Pacific interests.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced on Nov. 1 Australia would fund development of the base on Manus island, shortly after China emerged as a possible developer of the deep-water site.
Australia, a staunch U.S. ally, has for decades enjoyed largely unrivalled influence in the Pacific until China recently turned its attention to the region. 
Manus provincial governor Charlie Benjamin told Reuters the development had to benefit Manus residents but he had not been consulted about the plan.
""I have my people living on the island and we are the ones affected,"" Benjamin said. 
""The government might have the right but if we decide to put our foot down, there will be problems.""
Communities in sprawling, resources-rich PNG have at times opposed decisions made by the central government.
Benjamin, a member of PNG's parliament, has previously sparred with the central government over detention center facilities used on the island as part of Australia's controversial ""offshore detention"" policy.
Manus Island is PNG's smallest province with a population of about 50,000 people.
Neither Australian nor PNG have released details of the agreement.
Australian and PNG government spokesman were not immediately available for comment on Friday.
Morrison has said the agreement to build the base was not a response to China's growing influence in the region, but was part of a longstanding relationship with PNG.
PNG's navy is made up largely of patrol boats, mostly donated by Australia, and landing craft. Australia's navy would make visits to the new base, Morrison said.

Earlier this week Italy re-submitted its draft 2019 budget to the EU Commission with the same growth and deficit assumptions as a draft previously rejected for breaching EU rules, stepping up its showdown with Brussels.
Italian government is ""openly"" challenging budget rules agreed by all euro zone countries, but its policy is ""counterproductive"" as it worried investors and pushed bond yields higher, said Dombrovskis.
Dombrovskis added that in past years EU Commission has refrained from launching an excessive debt procedure against Italy as its budgets were anyway in line with the Stability pact, but if that would no longer be the case, then opening a procedure ""would be justified"".

1086,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 11:54PM ET</span>",Trump's summit no-show draws Asian nations closer together,"By John Chalmers
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump didn't make it to this week's summit of Asian nations in Singapore, but his influence was still keenly felt among the leaders who gathered in the city.
One prime minister warned that the trade war between Washington and Beijing could trigger a ""domino effect"" of protectionist steps by other countries. Another fretted that the international order could splinter into rival blocs.
""The most important and talked-about ... leader, President Trump, is the only one that did not turn up,"" said Malcolm Cook, a senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore.
And yet, in Trump's absence, countries from South to East Asia pressed on with forging multilateral ties on trade and investment among themselves, including with China.
China's representative at the meetings, Premier Li Keqiang, egged them on.
""Now the world is facing rising protectionism. It is all the more important for us to come together and respond to the complex world situation to uphold multilateralism and free trade,"" Li said on Thursday.
The U.S. president's lack of engagement with Asian nations came just days after a trip to France for World War One commemorations at which he appeared isolated from NATO allies. 
Simon Tay, chairman of the Singapore Institute of International Affairs, said Trump was inadvertently bringing Asian nations together.
""Not necessarily by design, but because he is not being a consistent and reassuring presence, and because his policies have tended to fracture the natural order that Asia is dependent upon,"" he said. ""Asians are trying to figure out what else they can do without relying on America too much.""
The White House did not respond to a request for comment.
TWO POWERS: TWO STRATEGIES
As well as the summits of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and East Asian nations in Singapore, Trump will also skip the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Papua New Guinea at the end of the week.
At APEC on Friday, President Xi Jinping will showcase China's Belt and Road initiative to Pacific leaders, several of whom are expected to sign up to the infrastructure investment drive.
Xi's multi-billion-dollar plan, which aims to bolster a sprawling network of land and sea links with Asian neighbors and far beyond, is viewed with suspicion in Western capitals as an attempt to assert Chinese influence.
Trump attended both the ASEAN and APEC meetings in 2017, and his decision to stay away this year has raised questions about Washington's commitment to a regional strategy to counter China.
Vice President Mike Pence, who represented Trump in Singapore, told the meeting that United States' commitment to the Indo-Pacific is ""steadfast and enduring.""
Asia presents the Trump administration with some of its most pressing foreign policy challenges, including its strategic rivalry with China and efforts to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program.
Washington has touted what it calls an ""Indo-Pacific"" strategy aimed at greater regional cooperation, notably with India, Australia and Japan, to counter China's influence, including in the disputed South China Sea, where it conducts naval patrols to challenge what it sees as Beijing's excessive territorial claims.
Pence said on Thursday - without naming China - that there was no place for ""empire and aggression"" in the Indo-Pacific.
His comments follow a major speech in October in which he flagged a tougher approach by Washington toward Beijing, accusing China of ""malign"" efforts to undermine Trump and reckless military actions in the South China Sea.
A U.S. State Department spokesman said: ""We welcome contributions by China to regional development, so long as it adheres to the highest standards the people of the region demand. We are concerned by China's use of coercion, influence operations, and implied military threats to persuade other states to heed China's strategic agenda."" 
Shortly before Pence spoke in Singapore, the U.S. Navy announced that two of its aircraft carriers with around 150 fighter jets were conducting warfare drills in the Philippine Sea, a show of force in waters south of China and within striking distance of North Korea. 
TAKING SIDES
Pence told reporters in Singapore that he had been struck in conversations with world leaders by ""the connection that President Trump has made"" with them through his vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific.
However, analysts say that countries across Asia are waiting for the United States to put substance behind its Indo-Pacific rhetoric, and Trump's absence from the summits only served to heighten concerns among Southeast Asian states that Washington no longer has their back.
Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Thursday it was ""very desirable"" for ASEAN not to have to take sides with world powers, but there may come a time when it would ""have to choose one or the other."" 
Some Southeast Asian nations may be quietly impressed by the United States' robust approach to Beijing on trade, intellectual property issues and the South China Sea, but others have made it clear they already see China's rise as inevitable.
Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, asked on Thursday about the U.S. Navy drills, noted that China already occupies contested South China Sea islands and added: ""Why do you have to create frictions ... that will prompt a response from China?.""
But Cook said Southeast Asian states' hedging and unwillingness to publicly criticize Chinese aggression have contributed to Washington's posture shift in Asia. 
""This change is certainly not all because of Trump,"" he said. ""The choices of Southeast Asian states in the end bear some responsibility.""

1087,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 11:35PM ET</span>",Japan PM tells Putin no U.S. bases on disputed isles if handed over: Asahi,"By Linda Sieg
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, eager to resolve a row that has haunted ties with Moscow since World War Two, has told Russian President Vladimir Putin the United States would not put troops on disputed islands if they are handed over to Japan, a newspaper reported on Friday.
Seeking to cement his diplomatic legacy and improve ties with Russia to counter a rising China, Abe has pledged to settle the dispute over four isles in the Western Pacific that were occupied by Soviet troops toward the end of the war. 
They are known as the Northern Territories in Japan and the Southern (NYSE:SO) Kuriles in Russia.
Any agreement involving transfer of sovereignty to Japan would have to address whether the U.S.-Japan security treaty, the core of Japan’s diplomacy, would apply, including whether Washington would have the right to put military bases on the islands.
The isles have strategic value for Russia, ensuring naval access to the western Pacific.
The two leaders agreed in talks in Singapore on Wednesday to speed up talks based on a 1956 joint declaration in which the Soviet Union agreed it would hand over two smaller islands after a peace treaty formally ending the war had been concluded.
The Asahi newspaper said Abe told Putin the United States would not put military bases on the two smaller islands thereafter, the Asahi newspaper said, adding Abe's top security adviser had previously said bases were possible.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga declined to comment on the report.
Japan has long insisted its sovereignty over all four islands be confirmed before a peace treaty is signed.
In recent years, however, there have been signs Tokyo was rethinking its stance, perhaps with ""two-plus-alpha"" formula that would focus on the handover of the two smaller isles and some sort of visa-free access to the larger islands plus joint economic projects.
A breakthrough has been elusive. But Abe, who is expected to meet Putin again at a Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires from Nov. 30 and in Russia early next year, has said he's determined to settle the dispute before leaving office in 2021.
Putin may be less keen. Russian news agency Tass quoted him as saying after meeting Abe in Singapore that talks based on the 1956 statement ""certainly demands separate, additional and in depth analysis, given that not everything is clear in that Declaration"".

1088,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 11:20PM ET</span>",Philippines court defers Marcos arrest after her graft conviction,"MANILA (Reuters) - Former Philippines first lady Imelda Marcos was granted bail on Friday after convincing a court to defer her arrest following her conviction a week ago for massive graft.
The move leaves Marcos free to prepare what could be a lengthy legal challenge, but will further fuel criticism of special treatment for a politically influential family.
Marcos, 89, famous for hoarding shoes, gems and valuable paintings, posted bail of 150,000 pesos ($2,846) a week after a being found guilty in absentia for seven counts of corruption involving use of Swiss bank accounts, collectively worth up to 77 years in prison.
The possibility of her arrest has captured domestic attention but the anti-graft court has given no explanation as to why it did not issue a warrant for her arrest in the week since the verdict.
Lawyers for the three-term sitting congresswoman have argued that Marcos was unable to attend because she was suffering from ""multiple organ infirmities"". 
On Friday she told the court that she was unaware the Nov. 9 verdict was even being delivered and first learned of her jail sentence on television news that afternoon.
She confirmed that she then attended a birthday party that evening, images of which appeared on social media and on news websites.
Her late husband Ferdinand Marcos ruled the Philippines for two decades, mostly under martial law during which thousands of opponents were persecuted, and billions of dollars were allegedly looted and funneled into real estate, artworks, offshore banks, and disbursed among a vast network of cronies.
The family was chased out in a 1986 popular uprising but returned from exile after Ferdinand's death and re-entered politics in the 1990s.
Marcos intends to appeal the decision and if denied, she can challenge it at the Supreme Court.
Opponents have complained about what they see as special treatment for a politically influential family that has done no jail time, despite scores of graft cases and the recovery of tens of millions of dollars of assets ruled to be ill-gotten.
President Rodrigo Duterte enjoys good ties with the family and has often praised the late strongman and expressed a preference for his son and namesake, Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos to be his vice president.

Duterte's spokesman last week said the guilty verdict was proof that the executive does not interfere with the judicial branch.

PORT MORESEBY (Reuters) - China has made a strategic decision to ""stand together with fellow developing countries"" such as Papua New Guinea, President Xi Jinping said on Friday, the first full day of his state visit to the Pacific island nation. 
The visit, ahead of an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit Xi will address on Saturday, comes amid heightened trade and diplomatic tension in a region that was until recently an almost exclusive sphere of influence of staunch U.S. ally Australia.
""Together we can go on to build many more roads to prosperity, openness and friendship,"" Xi said just before opening a new Beijing-funded six-lane boulevard, bedecked with red flags for the occasion.
APEC was established almost 30 years ago to remove barriers to trade in an area home to numerous tiny island economies reliant on third party aid and loans. 
China, which is stepping up its presence in the region, has recently faced criticism from some PNG officials for its lavish gifts, given at the potential expense of aid and development.
PNG is rich in resources, particularly oil and gas, and has strategically placed ports.
Xi was the first world leader to arrive in Port Moresby for APEC, at which China has said it will announce ""important measures for further cooperation"", a phrase Western diplomats believe probably means formally extending its Belt and Road plans into the Pacific.
Xi is scheduled to meet the leaders of several Pacific countries on Friday afternoon. 
First proposed by Xi in 2013, the Belt and Road promotes expanding land and sea links between Asia, Africa and Europe, with billions of dollars pledged for infrastructure development. 

PNG Prime Minister Peter O'Neill said on Friday he valued the strong support of the Chinese government to develop PNG.

1090,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 10:40PM ET</span>","Australia, Malaysia at loggerheads over possible Jerusalem embassy","By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's treasurer on Friday said Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad had a history of anti-Jewish statements, in an escalating war of words over the possibility Australia might move its Israeli embassy to Jerusalem.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison proposed the embassy move during a local election campaign last month, sparking concern from Indonesia and Malaysia.
""The Malaysian Prime Minister has form,"" Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said in a radio interview. ""He has called Jews hook-nosed people. He has questioned the number of people that have been killed in the Holocaust.""
The comments came after Mahathir brought up the issue of moving the embassy with Morrison during a meeting at the ASEAN summit on Thursday in Singapore.
""I pointed out that in dealing with terrorism, one has to know the causes,"" Mahathir told reporters afterwards, Australian media reported. ""Adding to the cause for terrorism is not going to be helpful.""
Some 60 percent of Malaysia's population is Muslim.
Indonesia has also expressed concern over the embassy review and suggested it might upset plans for a free trade agreement with Australia, though Morrison has said the issues were not conflated during recent talks he had with Indonesian President Joko Widodo.
Indonesia is the world's biggest Muslim-majority country, where tens of thousands protested against President Donald Trump's decision in May to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem.
Morrison floated the idea of moving the Australian embassy and recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital back in October.
The sudden announcement came just before a key by-election in a seat which happened to have a large Jewish community and Morrison's Liberal National government was desperate to win to keep its majority in parliament.
The seat was lost anyway, leaving the government ruling with the cooperation of independent lawmakers.
Speaking on Friday, Morrison confirmed Mahathir had raised the subject of the embassy but declared that only ""Australia determines Australian foreign policy"".
""I think what Josh said today was filling in the history of his (Mahathir's) record on various issues over time,"" Morrison told reporters on a visit to Darwin, where he is due to meet Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
""Make no mistake. I will not have our policy dictated by those outside the country,"" Morrison added. 
Australia and Malaysia have had a sometimes rocky diplomatic relationship. The two countries clashed 25 years ago when former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating called Mahathir ""recalcitrant"" for boycotting the 1993 Asia-Pacific economic forum (APEC). 

Leaders of APEC countries are due to meet in Papua New Guinea this weekend.

SAN JOSE (Reuters) - Same-sex couples in Costa Rica will have the right to get married by mid-2020, the nation's constitutional court has ruled, a first for socially conservative Central America.
In a majority decision made public on Thursday, the court backed the opinion of the San Jose-based Inter-American Court of Human Rights, which said in January that countries in the region should legalize same-sex unions.
Legalizing gay marriage was a major campaign promise by President Carlos Alvarado Quesada, who took office in May.
In recent years, same-sex couples have been allowed to marry in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Uruguay and parts of Mexico.
""It's now just a matter of time. Full equal rights will come, love will prevail,"" Alvarado Quesada tweeted on Thursday.
The ruling is scheduled to be published in the official gazette next week and will take effect 18 months afterward.
The court's ruling, ""which confirms the unconstitutionality of the articles that prohibit equal civil marriage, is a big step forward toward equality,"" the president added in his tweet.
The center-left Alvarado Quesada decisively defeated a conservative opponent in Costa Rica's presidential runoff in April by promising to allow gay marriage and protect the country's reputation for tolerance.
Alvarado Quesada said regulations would be modified to comply with the court ruling.
Despite Costa Rica's reputation as a socially forward- looking nation, with high education and health standards, reproductive rights such as in vitro fertilization and abortion are not widely accepted, polling has shown.
Barely 30 percent of Costa Ricans favored same-sex marriage, according to a survey released in January by the CIEP think tank of the University of Costa Rica.
Costa Rica's first same-sex wedding was blocked in January by notaries who refused to recognize it until laws forbidding gay marriage are changed.
Pro-government lawmaker Enrique Sanchez, an activist for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, said legal reforms to implement the law should be carried out smoothly, since the debate on whether same-sex marriage is legal had been settled.
""This is already a legal reality and now we must concentrate on making the adjustments to implement the law and continue to promote a culture of integration and tolerance in society,"" he said.
The Catholic Church's Episcopal Conference of Costa Rica criticized the ruling.

Pence on Wednesday voiced Washington's strongest condemnation yet of Myanmar's treatment of Rohingya Muslims, telling Suu Kyi that ""persecution"" by her country's army was ""without excuse"".
Meeting Suu Kyi on the sidelines of a Southeast Asian summit in Singapore, Li said China attaches great importance to its ties with Myanmar and would build on their tradition of friendship, China's Foreign Ministry said late on Thursday.
""The Chinese side supports Myanmar's efforts in maintaining its domestic stability, and supports Myanmar and Bangladesh appropriately resolving the Rakhine state issue via dialogue and consultation,"" the ministry cited Li as saying.
China is ""willing to provide the relevant parties with necessary support in this regard"", he added, without elaborating.
More than 700,000 Rohingya refugees crossed into Bangladesh from western Myanmar's Rakhine state, U.N. agencies say, after Rohingya insurgent attacks on Myanmar security forces in August 2017 triggered a sweeping military crackdown.
The two countries agreed on Oct. 30 to begin returning refugees to Myanmar in mid-November. The U.N. refugee agency has said conditions in Rakhine are ""not yet conducive for returns"".
China has close relations with Myanmar, and backs what Myanmar officials have called a legitimate counter-insurgency operation in Rakhine.
China's statement cited Suu Kyi as expressing thanks to China for the many times it has extended help to Myanmar, especially the constant understanding and support for the Myanmar peace process and the Rakhine issue.

A plan to begin repatriating hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslim refugees to Myanmar stalled on Thursday, amid protests by refugees at camps in Bangladesh and recriminations between the officials in both countries.

WASHINGTON/RIYADH (Reuters) - The United States imposed economic sanctions on 17 Saudi officials on Thursday for their role in the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor sought the death penalty for five suspects in the murder.
The U.S. Treasury Department sanctions were the first concrete response by the Trump administration to Khashoggi's death in the Saudi consulate in Turkey in October.
Among those sanctioned were Saud al-Qahtani, who has been removed from his position as a top aide to the powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as well as the Saudi Consul General Mohammad al-Otaibi and members of a 15-person team Turkey has identified as being involved.
The measure was unusual for Washington, which rarely imposes sanctions on Saudi nationals. The sanctions do not target the Riyadh government, an important U.S. security and economic ally.
It also allows the administration to stop short of action that might affect lucrative U.S. arms deals with Saudi Arabia that President Donald Trump has vowed to preserve.
The sanctions limit access to the U.S. financial system and freeze people's assets. They will be implemented under an act which targets perpetrators of serious human rights abuses and corruption.
""These individuals who targeted and brutally killed a journalist who resided and worked in the United States must face consequences for their actions,"" Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said in a statement.
Canada, which had a major diplomatic dispute with Saudi Arabia this year over human rights, welcomed the U.S. sanctions and said it was weighing similar action.
The U.S. government did not impose sanctions on Saudi officials over the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, in which 15 of the 19 hijackers were from the kingdom.
A U.S. government commission found no evidence that Saudi Arabia directly funded al Qaeda, which carried out the attacks on New York and Washington. The panel, however, left open whether individual Saudi officials might have.
DEATH SENTENCE
Khashoggi, a royal insider turned critic of Saudi policy, was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. He was a U.S. resident and columnist for The Washington Post and his killing has provoked a political crisis in Saudi Arabia as well as friction with Western allies.
Some members of the U.S. Congress said that even with the sanctions the administration has not been tough enough, specifically in regard to the Saudi crown prince. 
Democratic Senator Ben Cardin said: “I remain concerned that the administration is enabling the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in its effort to protect Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman from accountability.""
Later on Thursday, senators from both U.S. parties introduced legislation that, if it became law, would suspend weapon sales to Saudi Arabia as punishment for Khashoggi's death and for its role in Yemen's devastating civil war.
Riyadh initially denied any knowledge of Khashoggi's disappearance, then offered contradictory explanations including that he was killed in a rogue operation.
Saudi deputy public prosecutor and spokesman Shalaan al-Shalaan said on Thursday Khashoggi died by lethal injection after a struggle.
Without naming them, Shalaan said the Saudi prosecutor had requested the death penalty for five people ""charged with ordering and committing the crime, and for the appropriate sentences for the other indicted individuals"". He said 11 of 21 suspects have been indicted and will be referred to court.
Shalaan said Prince Mohammed, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, knew nothing of the operation, in which Khashoggi's body was dismembered, removed from the building and handed over to an unidentified ""local cooperator.""
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said the order for the operation came from the highest level of Saudi leadership but probably not King Salman, putting the spotlight instead on his 33-year-old heir.
Turkey wants the 15-man team that it says killed Khashoggi to be tried there. Trump has suggested ultimate responsibility lies with the prince.
Shalaan said Khashoggi was murdered after ""negotiations"" for his return to the kingdom failed. When asked why such a large team capable of poisoning and dismembering a body was used for a supposed extraction, Shalaan said the lead negotiator had surveyed the consulate before Khashoggi entered and decided it was unfeasible to remove him, so instead they killed him.
U.S. SANCTIONS TARGETS
Among others cited in Thursday's U.S. Treasury announcement are General Maher Mutreb, an aide to Qahtani who has appeared in photographs with Prince Mohammed on official visits this year to the United States and Europe.
Absent from the sanctions list were four officials fired last month along with Qahtani: General Ahmed al-Asiri, the deputy head of foreign intelligence, and three other intelligence deputies - General Rashad bin Hamed al-Hamadi, General Abdullah bin Khaleef al-Shaya, and General Mohammed Saleh al-Ramih.
The Treasury Department did not immediately respond to a request for an explanation of why they were not included.
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said there could be further U.S. measures.
""It’s a step in the right direction. It is an initial investigation finding. It is important that those steps continue to be taken for a full accountability. We will continue to work diligently to ascertain the facts,” she told a news briefing.
Some details provided by the Saudi prosecutor on Thursday again contradicted previous versions, none of which mentioned a drug-induced death and one of which called the killing premeditated based on information provided by Turkey.

Turkey says it has recordings related to the killing which it shared with Western allies. One Turkish official told Reuters that officials who heard the recordings, which includeKhashoggi's killing and conversations leading up to the operation, were horrified but their countries had done nothing.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - An Indonesia man, whose son was killed when a Lion Air flight crashed last month, has sued Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co alleging that a defect in the design of the 737 MAX 8 aircraft caused it to crash.
The lawsuit, filed on Wednesday in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, by the father of Dr. Rio Nanda Pratama, alleged that Boeing did not adequately warn Lion Air or its pilots of an unsafe design condition. Boeing is headquartered in Illinois. 
Lion Air Flight 610 crashed into the Java Sea shortly after take-off from Jakarta on Oct. 29, killing all 189 people on board.
Dr. Pratama, of Indonesia, was flying home from a conference when the plane crashed. He was to be married this week, according to attorney Curtis Miner of the Florida-based law firm Colson Hicks Eidson, which is representing his father in the wrongful death lawsuit.

Indonesian investigators are due to publish a preliminary report on the crash later this month.

In a strikingly good-humored three-hour debate in the northern city of Luebeck, the first of eight meetings with party grass roots across Germany before a leadership vote on Dec. 7, the rivals barely clashed on broad policy.
While there were different nuances on details, the three agreed to work to improve the integration of migrants, focus more on affordable housing, cut subsidies to poorer eastern states and further Merkel's digitalization drive.
The race for leader of the Christian Democratic Union party has shaped up as a dual between Merkel protege Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, widely seen as the continuity option, and Friedrich Merz, a millionaire who describes himself as ""a free-trade man"".
Merkel has said she will remain chancellor atop a 'grand coalition' with the CDU's Bavarian sister party and Social Democrats until the end of her term in 2021. 
CDU General Secretary Kramp-Karrenbauer, the front-runner, won applause for saying she would continue the process of renewal, by taking into account the views of the party base.
Former Merkel rival Merz said he aimed to take the CDU back over the 40 percent mark and halve support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), currently polling at around 16 percent. The CDU is at around 26-27 percent in most surveys.
""It is our job to do this,"" he said, adding the CDU had to make clear it had not forgotten voters who felt neglected after the influx of some 1.5 million migrants since 2015.
Health Minister Jens Spahn, the third candidate and an arch-critic of Merkel's migrant policy, said CDU policy had in part led to the rise of the AfD, now represented in all of Germany's 16 states. ""We can also get rid of them,"" he said.
All three candidates promised to work with each other after the leadership election and stressed their mutual respect. 
""I will not criticize the others, we will only say good things about each other ... In the end, the party must be the winner,"" said Merz. 
An opinion poll for broadcaster ARD conducted on Monday and Tuesday showed Kramp-Karrenbauer, known as mini-Merkel, still favorite among CDU voters with 46 percent support.

The poll, released on Thursday, showed 31 percent of CDU supporters favored Friedrich Merz, returning to politics after 10 years in the private sector. Twelve percent backed Spahn.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's highest court on Thursday overturned a contentious new security law aimed at regulating the long-time use of the military against drug cartels, a day after the president-elect's team said it was impossible to pull troops from the streets. 
Nine of 11 Supreme Court justices vetoed the measure, which President Enrique Pena Nieto sent to the court for constitutional review after signing it in December. 
The law intended to set out the rules under which armed forces can target organized crime, formalizing former president Felipe Calderon's deployment of the military to the streets some 12 years ago. An estimated 170,000 people have died in the ensuing conflict and thousands more have gone missing.
Human rights groups warned the law could open the door to abuses by the military, already accused of human rights violations. 
The nine judges said Congress does not have the authority to legislate on ""domestic security."" They called the law ""unconstitutional"" and said only the executive branch can dispatch troops.
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who takes office Dec. 1, has vowed to radically alter Mexico's strategy to fight violence, including pardoning low-level drug offenders and addressing root causes such as poverty. 
Alfonso Durazo, Lopez Obrador's future security minister, said at a press conference on Wednesday ""there is no way"" to withdraw armed forces from the fight against organized crime, because they are more trustworthy and capable than the police.
He added that the government would propose forming a National Guard that would take over the army's role half-way into Lopez Obrador's six-year term. The body would comprise 50,000 people from the army, navy and federal police.
Senator Mario Delgado, a leader of Lopez Obrador's National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), said the party next week will present an initiative to reform the constitution and allow a future National Guard to patrol the streets.
The opposing National Action Party (PAN) rejected the plan. 
""Lopez Obrador's proposal completely abandons the civil path and opts for a military proposal,"" said party president Marko Cortes.

A White House official told Reuters the NBC story was ""not accurate,"" but did not elaborate.
NBC, citing four sources, said Trump administration officials asked federal law enforcement agencies to look into whether Gulen, accused by Erdogan of instigating a failed 2016 coup, could legally be forced out of the United States.
Gulen's media adviser, Alp Aslandogan, said he had not been informed of any new U.S. inquiry.
Erdogan has long demanded that Washington extradite Gulen, who denies any involvement in the attempted coup and has lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since 1999. U.S. officials have said the courts need sufficient evidence to extradite the elderly cleric.
Erdogan ramped up pressure on Saudi Arabia after U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi rulers, was killed at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, where he had gone to pick up documents related to his upcoming marriage.
Saudi Arabia is considered critical to President Donald Trump's effort to curb Iran's growing influence in the region.
Erdogan has insisted Khashoggi's killing was ordered at the ""highest levels"" of the Saudi government and has kept pressure on de facto Saudi ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
""The White House has not been involved in any discussions relating the extradition of Fethullah Gulen to the death of Jamal Khashoggi,"" the White House official said.
A senior Turkish official told Reuters that Turkey's extradition request and its Khashoggi investigation were separate issues ""not connected in any way, shape or form.""
NBC News cited sources as saying the Trump administration had directed the Justice Department and FBI to reopen Turkey's case for Gulen's extradition and also asked the Department of Homeland Security for information about his legal status.
NBC News said one option the administration was considering was trying to force Gulen to relocate to South Africa.
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said U.S. authorities continued to evaluate material Turkey has provided on Gulen but that it remained a Justice Department matter and the White House had not been involved in any extradition discussions.
The Justice Department and the FBI declined comment. A source familiar with Justice Department operations was unaware of any kind of significant investigation related to Gulen.

NBC said career officials at the agencies had pushed back at the White House requests.

TIJUANA, Mexico (Reuters) - Demonized by U.S. President Donald Trump and exhausted after a harrowing journey, migrants from Central America in a caravan now face a new threat: open hostility from some Mexicans. 
A small group of residents in an upscale Tijuana neighborhood near the Mexican border confronted caravan migrants late on Wednesday, throwing stones and telling them to go back to their home countries.
""Get out of here,"" around 20 people shouted at a camp of Hondurans near the border. ""We want you to return to your country. You are not welcome.""
Migrants shouted back and dozens of police officers had to intervene to keep peace in a city known for welcoming both American tourists and thousands of immigrants every year. 
A caravan of thousands of mostly Honduran migrants who are fleeing violence and poverty at home set off for the United States in mid-October, with the bulk of them still to arrive at the border. Other large bands of mostly Salvadorans have followed.
Trump has declared the caravans an ""invasion,"" and has sent some 5,800 troops to ""harden"" the border, including with barbed wire.
With some exceptions, Mexico has welcomed the Central Americans, offering food and lodging in towns during their journey. The migrants said they were stunned by the hostile attitude in Tijuana.
""We are not criminals. Why do (they) treat us like this if everywhere we have traveled in Mexico they treated us well?"" migrants shouted back. ""Think about the children who are here, please.""
Recent polls show a sizeable minority of Mexicans opposed to aiding the migrants as they head northward to the United States.
An Oct. 26-28 survey of 1,000 Mexicans by polling firm Consulta Mitofsky showed that 51.4 percent were in favor of helping or protecting the migrants, while 33.8 percent took the opposite view, believing that they should return home. The remaining respondents expressed no opinion.
Mexican Interior Minister Alfonso Navarrete said job fairs would be held around the country from Thursday to lay out opportunities for Central Americans, reiterating earlier government offers of work. This time though, he emphasized that there was also work for Mexicans seeking jobs.
At a news conference that included Juan Pablo Castanon, head of the CCE business lobby, Navarrete said the private sector had told the government there were enough jobs available for all the Central Americans who entered Mexico during October.
Since Oct. 19, a total of 3,800 migrants had sought asylum in Mexico, Navarrete said, though some later dropped their applications and returned home. As of now, 2,600 asylum requests were being processed, the minister added.
Mexico's low-paying factories at times struggle to find workers, and the border area is suffering chronic labor shortages.
WELCOMING HISTORY
Tensions began brewing in Tijuana a few days ago when residents complained about a group of 80 or so LGBT migrants who broke away from the caravan and arrived in an upscale part of the Playas de Tijuana neighborhood, near where the stones were thrown.
A popular party town for U.S. tourists, Tijuana has a history of absorbing visitors, including Chinese immigrants in the 19th century. It has a large American population and some 3,000 Haitians settled in the city, just south of San Diego, in 2016 after failing to cross the U.S. border.
But the arrival of hundreds of members of the caravans has stretched to the limit migrant shelters that were already overflowing with people. While Tijuana's traditional generosity was also on display, with the government setting up a new shelter and citizens offering food and clothing, a harder attitude also emerged.
Reuters gained access to a WhatsApp chat group called ""Citizen Blockade"" where some 250 members using strong language discussed strategies to harass the migrants or block their arrival.
Tijuana's city government opened a shelter for 360 people of an estimated 810 that arrived this week, and officials warned there was little room to house more than 2,000 more who are expected to arrive this week. 
Irineo Mujica, representative of the organization Pueblos Sin Fronteras, which is advising the migrants in the caravan, said the migrants wanted to seek asylum in the United States. 
Their arrival adds to already long lines of people who have been waiting their turn at the Tijuana crossing. Last week, Trump suspended the granting of asylum to migrants who cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.

""We are looking for solutions, not confrontations,"" Mujica said following the clash with Mexicans as a helicopter hovered above, surveying the scene from the American side.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - An adviser to Mexican president-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador sought on Thursday to reassure investors in New York, following weeks of upheaval in Mexican financial markets and doubts about the policies of the incoming left-leaning government.
Abel Hibert, an economic adviser to Lopez Obrador, acknowledged that financial markets were watching closely.
""We recognize that we have one opportunity to show responsibility in the elaboration of the next budget,"" Hibert said to a crowd of investors at a business forum in New York.
""The design of the public budget will be very careful,"" he said. ""We don't have room for mistakes.""
Markets were shook in recent weeks by announcements from the incoming administration that it would cancel a partly-built $13 billion Mexico City airport and limit bank commissions.
On Thursday, the Mexican stock benchmark index (MXX) touched its lowest level in nearly three years.
Hibert estimated the cost of calling off the airport project at 0.7 percent of the country's gross domestic product.
Without detailing specifics, he said some plans for next year would be scrapped as a result.
""Some of the social and infrastructure projects must be postponed to leave room for the financial consequences of the cancellation of the airport project,"" Hibert said.
During his presentation, he said someone with a similar profile to recently-nominated independent economist Jonathan Heath would fill the central bank board seat that will be vacated after deputy governor Roberto del Cueto steps down on Nov. 30.
The country's president nominates appointees to the bank board, who must be ratified by Congress. 
""The substitution of Roberto will be in the same profile as Jonathan (Heath),"" Hibert said, adding that the incoming government values the autonomy of the central bank.

Lopez Obrador will be sworn in as Mexico's new president for a six-year term, without possibility of reelection, on Dec. 1.

PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis's hold on power appeared weaker on Thursday evening as thousands of protesters demanded his resignation in Prague's main square, while his coalition partners debated whether to quit the government.
The pressure against him followed a media report in which Babis's son said his father had wanted him to go into hiding to impede a criminal investigation into Babis and two of his children on suspicion they illegally tapped a 2 million euro ($2.27 million) EU subsidy a decade ago.
The opposition reacted by calling a parliamentary no confidence vote. The house speaker said on Thursday the vote, whose outcome appears uncertain, would likely take place on Nov. 23.
Babis, a billionaire businessman and the EU and NATO member country's most popular politician, has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and dismissed the report, published by news website Seznam.cz, as part of a media campaign against him.
In Prague's Wenceslas Square (NYSE:SQ), several thousand chanted ""resignation"" and ""shame"". Some waved Czech and EU flags and carried slogans including ""Down with Babis"". 
The center-left Social Democrats, a coalition partner of Babis's ANO party in the minority administration, have been considering ""all options"" regarding further action, party leader Jan Hamacek said.
""The situation is serious, the information is substantial and we have to examine the most responsible approach,"" Hamacek told Czech Television.
If the government loses the vote, it must resign. A new prime minister would be appointed by the pro-Chinese and pro-Russian President Milos Zeman.
Babis may however look for support elsewhere to survive as prime minister. The far-right opposition SPD, an anti-EU and anti-NATO party, has indicated it may be willing to back a Babis-led cabinet without Social Democrat ministers if it changes some of its policies.
The chance that Babis might possibly retain his job even if the Social Democrats pulled out has led some of the party's lawmakers to lean toward staying in government, a party source told Reuters.
Babis's son Andrej told Seznam.cz reporters who tracked him to his current home in Switzerland that his father had wanted him to hide last year when police brought charges in the subsidy case.
In videoed comments Babis junior, who has been treated for mental illness, said that a man who had been looking after him took him from the Czech Republic and held him against his will in Russian-annexed Crimea, but said he believed it was not his father's idea.
Police said on Tuesday they had investigated that allegation and concluded there was no suspicion of a crime.

Babis said his son traveled to Crimea voluntarily. He said the son, who has Swiss citizenship, had been treated for schizophrenia since 2015. The man who had been taking care of the son also denied wrongdoing.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Climate change, steel and migration have emerged as sticking points in the final communique that world leaders will issue at the end of the Group of 20 summit in Argentina later this month, an Argentine government official said on Thursday.
Those issues were the ""most complicated"" areas of discussion, said Argentina's Pedro Villagra Delgado, the lead organizer, or ""sherpa,"" for the summit of leaders from key industrialized and developing economies. 
But he told a press briefing he was optimistic these issues would be resolved in time.
The G20 communique is a non-binding agreement on key international policy issues and will be presented at the conclusion of the two-day summit, which begins on Nov. 30.
Villagra Delgado said the United States was resistant to including language that outlined guidelines for climate goals in the document. 
After withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement last year, the United States broke with other G20 member countries who have pledged to end coal usage and take steps to reach the goals outlined in the accord.
Villagra Delgado also said China disagreed with the rest of the G20 countries on steel, but did not provide further details over the specifics of their disagreement. 
The United States has skirmished with a number of its trading partners - including China - over steel, imposing a 25 percent duty on imports of steel and a tariff of 10 percent on aluminum.
Other countries objected to including language about immigration in the communique, Villagra Delgado said, but would not elaborate on which countries expressed concern. 
Reform of the World Trade Organization (WTO) may also be a topic of discussion at this month's meeting, Villagra Delgado said, but added that specific issues to be discussed in the G20 sessions were still being worked out.

U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to pull out of the WTO, while China has claimed the 20-year-old organization's dispute resolution mechanisms are outdated in the current global economy.

The Trump administration pulled the bulk of U.S. funding of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in January after a U.N. General Assembly vote rejected Washington's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
Since President Donald Trump's move, the EU has become UNRWA's largest single donor, Japan had increased its funding, and four Gulf countries - Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates - had contributed $200 million, according to UNRWA chief Pierre Kraehenbuehl. 
He told reporters that the U.S. funding cut had made 2018 a very difficult year for UNRWA, which runs schools and clinics for 5.4 million Palestinians across the Middle East, including in Gaza and the West Bank.
It began 2018 with a shortfall of $146 million in its planned budget of $1.2 billion. That ballooned to $446 million after Trump's cutback, forcing Kraehenbuehl to seek new funds from other countries and private sector donors. 
""We decided not to sit back and complain but to reach out and launch a global campaign called 'dignity is priceless', and that really mobilized the international community,"" he said.
""We have mobilized until now $382 million of additional funding, which means we brought the shortfall down to $64 million, and we are still in contact with a number of countries; we are hopeful that this shortfall will be brought down further in couple of weeks,"" said Kraehenbuehl.
He added that it was at least good to have a greater geographical spread of donors more representative of the United Nations as a whole. But new donations would have to be stabilized to keep UNRWA funded next year and in future years.
""We're not out of the woods (yet),"" he said.
Trump's endorsement in December of Israel's claim to Jerusalem as its capital drew universal condemnation from Arab leaders and criticism around the world. It broke with decades of U.S. policy that the city's status must be decided in peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on 17 Saudi officials on Thursday for their role in the killing last month of Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, the first concrete response by the Trump administration to the journalist's death.
Among those sanctioned were Saud al-Qahtani, who has been removed from his position as a top aide to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as well as the Saudi Consul General Mohammed Alotaibi and members of a 15-person team Turkey has identified as being involved in Khashoggi's death.
The announcement was unusual for Washington, which rarely imposes sanctions on Saudi nationals. The sanctions do not target the Riyadh government, an important U.S. security and economic ally.
It also allows President Donald Trump's administration to stop short of any action that might affect lucrative U.S. arms deals with Saudi Arabia that he has vowed to preserve.
The sanctions limit access to the U.S. financial system and freeze the individuals' assets. They will be implemented under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which targets perpetrators of serious human rights abuses and corruption.
""These individuals who targeted and brutally killed a journalist who resided and worked in the United States must face consequences for their actions,"" Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said in a statement. 
""The Government of Saudi Arabia must take appropriate steps to end any targeting of political dissidents or journalists,"" Mnuchin said. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called Thursday's announcement ""an important step"" in the response to Khashoggi's killing and said his department would continue to seek facts, consult the U.S. Congress and work with other countries to hold accountable anyone who was involved.
TURKEY IDENTIFIED MANY OF THOSE SANCTIONED
Among others cited in Thursday's announcement are Maher Mutreb, an aide to Qahtani who has appeared in photographs with Prince Mohammed on official visits this year to the United States and Europe. 
He and 14 others were members of the team Turkey identified as being responsible for killing Khashoggi.
Absent from the sanctions list were four officials fired last month along with Qahtani: General Ahmed Asiri, the deputy head of foreign intelligence, and three other intelligence deputies - General Rashad bin Hamed al-Hamadi, director of the general directorate of security and protection, General Abdullah bin Khaleef al-Shaya, assistant head for human resources, and General Mohammed Saleh al-Ramih, assistant head for intelligence affairs.
Treasury did not immediately respond to a request for an explanation of why they were not included.
The U.S. sanctions were announced a few hours after Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor said the death penalty was being sought for five out of 11 suspects charged in Khashoggi's murder, as the kingdom tries to contain its biggest political crisis in a generation.
Khashoggi, a royal insider-turned-critic of Saudi policy, was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 after a struggle, by lethal injection, deputy public prosecutor and spokesman Shalaan al-Shalaan told reporters. 
Shalaan said Prince Salman knew nothing of the operation, in which Khashoggi's body was dismembered, removed from the building and handed over to an unidentified ""local cooperator.""
In contrast to Thursday's announcement, the U.S. government never imposed sanctions on Saudi officials over the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, in which 15 of the 19 hijackers were from the kingdom.

A U.S. government commission found no evidence that Saudi Arabia directly funded al Qaeda, which carried out the attacks on New York and Washington. The panel, however, left open whether individual Saudi officials might have.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. military will withdraw hundreds of troops focused on counterterrorism operations in Africa over the next several years to support the Pentagon's increased focus on countering threats from China and Russia, a U.S. official said on Thursday.
Earlier this year, the U.S. military put countering China and Russia at the center of a new national defense strategy, the latest sign of shifting priorities after more than a decade and a half of focusing on the fight against Islamist militants.
""The reduction of military personnel is projected to be less than 10 percent of the 7,200 total military forces and will take place over the next several years,"" Commander Candice Tresch, a Pentagon spokeswoman, told Reuters.
Tresch said the cuts would leave ""counter-violent extremist organization"" activities largely untouched in several countries, including Somalia, Djibouti and Libya. 
In other parts of the region, including West Africa, the emphasis would shift from ""tactical assistance to advising, assisting, liaising, and sharing intelligence.""
A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the reduction of troops would likely take place over three years and could include countries like Kenya, Cameroon, and Mali.
The United States' military role on the African continent has received increased attention after an ambush last year in Niger, carried out by a local Islamic State affiliate, which killed four U.S. soldiers.
The Pentagon move comes as China and Russia look to increase their influence in Africa.
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union forged close military and diplomatic ties with many African countries. Russia is now trying to revive some of the relationships that lapsed after the Soviet Union’s collapse. 
Since Western nations sanctioned Russia for annexing Crimea in 2014, Moscow has signed 19 military cooperation deals in sub-Saharan Africa, including with Ethiopia, Nigeria and Zimbabwe, according to its foreign and defense ministries and state media.
China has long had a major economic presence in Africa but has shied away from military involvement. However, last year, it went a step further, opening its first military base outside China in Djibouti.
A congressionally mandated report by former U.S. officials released earlier this week said that the military did not have sufficient resources to fund the military's needs and the goals set out by U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis earlier this year.

1108,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>",'I'm going to see this through': UK PM May vows to fight for Brexit deal,"By Elizabeth Piper, Kylie MacLellan and William James
LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May vowed to fight for her draft divorce deal with the European Union on Thursday after the resignation of her Brexit secretary and other ministers put her strategy and her job in peril.
Just over 12 hours after May announced that her cabinet had agreed to the terms of the deal, Brexit minister Dominic Raab and work and pensions minister Esther McVey resigned.
Eurosceptics in May's Conservative Party said they had submitted letters calling for a vote of no confidence in her leadership.
May called a news conference at her Downing Street residence to underline her determination to stay the course.
Asked if she would contest any challenge to her position, she replied: ""Am I going to see this through? Yes.""
However, hostility from government and opposition lawmakers raised the risk that the deal would be rejected in parliament, and that Britain could leave the EU on March 29 without a safety net.
That prospect pushed the pound  down as much as 2 percent to $1.2731, although it recovered slightly after May's statement. 
The main stock index in Ireland, which is highly dependent on trade with Britain, plunged 3.8 percent.
The German carmaker BMW, which produces its Mini model in Britain, said that, with the political situation so uncertain, it would continue to prepare for a 'no-deal' Brexit. 
""BEST DEAL FOR BRITAIN""
Two junior ministers, two ministerial aides and the Conservatives' vice chairman joined Raab and McVey in quitting. 
May said she understood their unhappiness, but added: ""I believe with every fiber of my being that the course I have set out is the right one for our country and all our people ...
""I am going to do my job of getting the best deal for Britain.""
By seeking to preserve the closest possible ties with the EU, May has upset her party's many advocates of a clean break, and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which props up her minority government.
Meanwhile, proponents of closer relations with the EU in her own party and the Labour opposition say the deal squanders the advantages of membership for little gain.
Both sides say it effectively cedes power to the EU without securing the promised benefits of greater autonomy. 
""It is ... mathematically impossible to get this deal through the House of Commons. The stark reality is that it was dead on arrival,"" said Conservative Brexit-supporting lawmaker Mark Francois.
The deal will need the backing of about 320 of parliament's 650 MPs to pass.
The ultimate outcome remains uncertain. Scenarios include May's deal ultimately winning approval; May losing her job; Britain leaving the bloc with no agreement; or even another referendum.
""WORSE THAN ANTICIPATED""
Analysts from U.S. bank Citi (N:C) said Britain was now likely either to stay in the EU or leave without a deal.
Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of a Conservative eurosceptic group in parliament, said the draft was ""worse than anticipated"", and he had formally requested a vote of no confidence in May. 
At least 14 Conservative lawmakers openly said they had submitted such letters, although others could have done so secretly. Forty-eight are needed to trigger a challenge. 
But May told parliament: ""The choice is clear. We can choose to leave with no deal, we can risk no Brexit at all, or we can choose to unite and support the best deal that can be negotiated.""
Rees-Mogg told journalists the next prime minister should be someone who believed in Brexit. 
But a May ally, former interior minister Amber Rudd, told Sky News: ""The problem isn't the prime minister. The problem is the challenges she's got to deliver in trying to pull together this Brexit. She's the best person to do it."" 
The Labour Party said the government was ""falling apart"".
""NO ABILITY TO EXIT""
In parliament, lawmakers from all sides spent three hours mostly attacking the draft, agreed with the EU on Tuesday after more than a year of difficult negotiations.
""No democratic nation has ever signed up to be bound by such an extensive regime, imposed externally without any democratic control over the laws to be applied, nor the ability to decide to exit the arrangement,"" Raab said in his resignation letter.
Others said the so-called ""Irish backstop"", to be used if no better way can be found to avoid future checks on the border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland, would tear Britain apart, leaving Northern Ireland all but inside the EU's single market.
It was this arrangement, which sees Britain and the EU establishing a single customs territory, but Northern Ireland aligned more closely with the EU, that spurred most criticism.
The DUP has threatened to pull its support from the minority government if the backstop means the province is treated differently from mainland Britain.
EU leaders are ready to meet on Nov. 25 to sign off on the divorce deal, or Withdrawal Agreement, but French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe summed up the uncertainty when he said events in London raised concerns about whether it would be ratified. 
""We need to prepare ourselves for a no-deal Brexit,"" he said.
A group of EU states including France also raised objections to what has been agreed so far on fishing between the EU and UK after Brexit, diplomatic sources said.
Raab, 44, was named Brexit secretary in July after the resignation of his predecessor David Davis, who also quit in protest at May's strategy.
At the heart of Raab's criticism was the belief that the pursuit of a temporary customs union with the EU would be the starting point for talks on the future relationship with the bloc, ""severely prejudicing"" what Britain could achieve.

He said he could not support an indefinite backstop arrangement, and that May's plan threatened the integrity of the United Kingdom.

The country appeared politically rudderless after the speaker of parliament declared there was no functioning prime minister or cabinet due to a no-confidence vote on Wednesday against Mahinda Rajapaksa, whom President Maithripala Sirisena appointed last month in controversial circumstances.
But late on Thursday Sirisena met Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and leaders of some political parties, urging them to hold a new motion on Friday and drop their position that the appointment of Rajapaksa as prime minister was unconstitutional.
""The president informed them to show their majority in parliament in a proper way following parliamentary procedure, and agreed to act according to the constitution,"" Sirisena's media team said in a statement after the meetings.
It was not immediately clear if the call for a new motion meant Sirisena was willing to acknowledge that Rajapaksa did not enjoy broad parliamentary support. Reuters could not immediately contact the political parties the president met with.
Parliament had passed a no-confidence motion against Rajapaksa and his government with the backing of 122 of the 225 lawmakers in a voice vote, followed by a signed document.
Sirisena, who triggered the crisis by firing Ranil Wickremesinghe as prime minister and naming Rajapaksa to the job, dissolved parliament last week and ordered elections to break the deadlock.
But the Supreme Court ordered a suspension of that decree on Tuesday until it had heard petitions challenging the move as unconstitutional.

""Our peacekeeping colleagues tell us that six peacekeepers from Malawi and one from Tanzania who are part of the UN peacekeeping operation in the DRC ... were killed yesterday, in Beni territory, in North Kivu,"" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters in New York.
East Congo has been plagued by banditry and armed insurrections for more than two decades since the fall of former military ruler Mobutu Sese Seko, but the past year has seen a surge in violence around North Kivu. 
Beni and the surrounding villages are also suffering an Ebola epidemic that has infected over 300 people and killed two thirds of them.
This makes it the third worst outbreak ever after a 2013-2016 outbreak in West Africa when 28,000 people were infected and in Uganda in 2000 when there were 425 cases.
Constant armed attacks by at least two rebel groups in the region are hampering international efforts to contain the virus, by preventing medical workers from gaining access to Ebola victims.

The Kremlin on Monday dismissed an earlier allegation from Finnish Prime Minister Juha Sipila that Russia may have intentionally disrupted the signal during the war games.
Finland's air navigation services earlier this month issued a warning for air traffic due to a large-scale GPS interruption in the north of the country.
Norway had posted a similar warning in its own airspace and also accused Russia.
Finnish authorities are continuing to investigate the matter and the issue is being discussed with the Russian Federation through diplomatic channels, the ministry added in a statement on Thursday.
Finland is not a NATO member but it took part as an ally in NATO's largest exercise in decades which ended on Wednesday. Forces from 31 countries participated in the games close to Russia, in an area stretching from the Baltic Sea to Iceland.
Finland shares an 833-mile (1,340 km) border and a difficult history with Russia. It has lately developed closer ties with NATO but stopped short of full membership in line with a tradition of avoiding confrontation with its eastern neighbor.

In a statement from EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, the bloc's member states said they were concerned about the recent political situation in Tanzania, citing restrictions on the media and political parties and threats against LGBTI people.
The announcement comes after Denmark said it had suspended nearly $10 million worth of aid money to the East African nation on the same day the World Bank said it had scrapped a plan to loan Tanzania $300 million after the country reaffirmed its policy of banning pregnant girls from school and made it a crime to question official statistics.
The EU said that pressure from the Tanzanian government on its ambassador forced his departure and return to Brussels, as deteriorating rights and freedoms in the East African nation come under fire from western donors.
""This unprecedented attitude is not in line with the long established tradition of bilateral dialogue and consultation between the two parties, which the EU deeply regrets,"" the bloc said in a statement.
Earlier this month, the EU recalled its envoy in Tanzania and said it was going to review its relations with the country in response to the announcement of a planned crackdown there on homosexuality.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday refused to dismiss criminal charges against a Russian company accused by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller of funding a propaganda operation to sway the 2016 presidential election in Donald Trump’s favor.
The ruling by Judge Dabney Friedrich in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia came after lawyers for Concord Management and Consulting LLC argued the indictment brought against it failed to properly allege a crime.
Concord is one of three corporate entities, along with 13 Russian individuals, indicted by Mueller’s office in February in an alleged conspiracy to tamper with the U.S. presidential race by adopting false online personas to push divisive messages, traveling to the United States to collect intelligence and staging political rallies.
The indictment says Concord is controlled by Russian businessman Evgeny Prigozhin, who has been dubbed by Russian media as Russian President Vladimir ""Putin's cook"" and whom U.S. officials have said has extensive ties to Russia’s military and political establishment.
Although Russian officials cannot be extradited to the United States to stand trial, the company hired American attorneys to fight Mueller's charges.
The ruling on Thursday marked the second time the same judge had refused to dismiss charges against Concord. In their first attempt, Concord's lawyers had argued that Mueller was illegally appointed and lacked prosecutorial authority.
Their latest attempt turned on more technical legal arguments related to whether prosecutors adequately met the legal burden to charge the company with conspiring to defraud the United States and whether the indictment properly alleged the firm willfully violated the law, among other things.
""Concord's concerns amount to a single attack: that the government has charged Concord based on conduct that is not illegal,"" Friedrich wrote in her opinion.
""But Concord cannot escape the fact that the course of deceptive conduct alleged is illegal.""
Concord is now participating in a similar case challenging Mueller's powers that was brought by Andrew Miller, an associate of Trump's longtime adviser Roger Stone who has defied a subpoena to appear before a grand jury. 

A federal appeals court has yet to rule in that case.

(Reuters) - Chile's President Sebastian Pinera has promised the government will ""spare no means"" in investigating the fatal shooting of an indigenous Mapuche man during a confrontation with police that sparked widespread fury among locals, opposition members of parliament and rights groups.
Camilo Catrillanca Marin, 24, was shot in the head on Wednesday after police allegedly came under attack from automatic gunfire during an operation to detain a suspected gang of car thieves in a rural community near the town of Ercilla, 480 miles south of Santiago in the restive province of Araucania. 
The Chilean police director general said it was unclear who shot Catrillanca, the grandson of an indigenous leader. Locals told Chilean media he had been herding cattle. 
President Pinera defended his deployment of police special forces to the area, and promised a swift investigation into the ""regrettable"" incident. 
""The government will spare no means to get to the truth of what happened, and has requested the exclusive deployment of a prosecutor to this case,"" he said in a post on Twitter, adding ""we reaffirm the right of police to pursue crimes and their right to defend themselves when attacked."" 
Opposition parties and rights groups denounced the shooting as evidence of Pinera's ""militarization"" of the region to settle conflicts between multinational logging firms and indigenous residents claiming the land belongs to them.
Center-right Pinera, who came to office in March, announced an action plan of infrastructure investment and support for local entrepreneurs and tourism. 
He deployed a special forces police contingent trained in Colombia and nicknamed Jungle Command, to enforce anti-terrorism legislation that aims to stop arson attacks on industry. 
Francisco Huenchumilla, an indigenous Mapuche senator with the Christian Democrats party, said the use of Jungle Command to combat common criminality was ""absolutely disproportionate"" and could inflame the situation. 
Local media reported an arson attack on a church and the stoning of a farmers' house in Ercilla, as well as road barricades set up following the fatal shooting. 
A communique issued by Mapuche activists in the nearby community of Antonio Peñeipil de Galvarino, announced ""three days of rebellion"".
""This death only reaffirms the just fight of our people for our usurped lands which today remain in the hands of forestry companies, the descendents of colonizers, tourism companies, hydroelectric plants, salmon producers and individuals who have irregularly seized possession,"" the communique, seen by Reuters, read.

1115,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 11:55AM ET</span>",Netanyahu faces snap election calls after defense minister quits,"By Maayan Lubell
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced calls on Thursday from his coalition partners to hold an early election, a day after the defense minister's resignation left the government with a razor-thin majority.
Avigdor Lieberman quit on Wednesday over what he described as the government's too-soft policy on cross-border violence with Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip.
The loss of the five seats of Lieberman's Israel Beitenu faction leaves Netanyahu with control of just 61 of the 120 seats in parliament, raising the prospect that a scheduled November 2019 election would be brought forward. 
Lieberman's resignation takes effect 48 hours after being handed in, which he did early on Thursday. Each coalition partner will then have the power to bring down the government. 
To avert a crisis, Netanyahu has been holding talks with ministers in an effort to stabilize the government. 
Israel's Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon, who heads the centrist Kulanu party, said he told Netanyahu in their meeting that the responsible step to take would be to establish a new and stable government. 
""The best thing for Israel's citizens and economy is to hold an election as soon as possible,"" Kahlon said in a statement. His call was echoed by Interior Minister Aryeh Deri who heads the ultra-Orthodox Shas faction.
Adding to the pressure, Israel's Education Minister Naftali Bennett, who heads the far-right Jewish Home party, has demanded the defense brief by given to him. 
Both Lieberman and Bennett, who compete with Netanyahu's Likud for right-wing voters, have spoken in favor of harsh Israeli military action against Gaza's dominant Hamas Islamists.
Israel has fought three wars in Gaza since Hamas took over the enclave in 2007.
""I asked the prime minister yesterday to appoint me defense minister to fulfill one goal only - that Israel start winning again,"" Bennett said at a conference near Tel Aviv. 
Jewish Home said on Wednesday that without the defense brief, there would be no point in keeping the government together. 
However Bennett did not repeat this in his remarks on Thursday nor did he render an explicit ultimatum to Netanyahu, with whom he is due to meet on Friday. 
It was unclear whether Netanyahu would opt for an early election. 
Netanyahu is under investigation for corruption, and speculation has been rife that he may bring the ballot forward in order to win a renewed mandate before Israel's attorney-general decides whether to indict him. 

A poll published on Wednesday by Israel's Hadashot television news showed Likud falling by one seat from 30 to 29 after months of surveys that have shown it gaining power. Only 17 percent of respondents were happy with Netanyahu's Gaza policy.

1116,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 11:54AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. troop levels at Mexico border likely at peak - commander,"By Phil Stewart
BASE CAMP DONNA, Texas (Reuters) - The number of U.S. troops at the border with Mexico may have peaked at about 5,800, the U.S. commander of the mission told Reuters, noting he would start looking next week at whether to begin sending forces home or perhaps shifting some to new border positions. 
The outlook by Lieutenant General Jeffrey Buchanan, while not definitive, suggests that the high-profile military mission could soon achieve its goal of helping harden the border ahead of the expected arrival of caravans of Central American migrants in the coming weeks. 
The deployment, which critics have called a pre-election political stunt by President Donald Trump, was initially expected to reach more than 7,000 troops, acting in support of U.S. Customs and Border , or CBP. 
U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis authorized the mission through Dec. 15, and while Buchanan did not rule out an extension, he did not think one appeared likely at this point, based on the current tasks assigned to the military. 
""It is a hard date. And we have no indications that CBP is going to need us to do our work for longer than that,"" Buchanan said on Wednesday at Base Camp Donna in Texas, as Mattis toured the site near the Mexico border. 
He acknowledged that there could be new requests, saying: ""If we get an extension, we get an extension. But I’ve got no indications of that so far.""
Asked whether he thought the troop levels had peaked, Buchanan said: ""I do. We might increase by a hundred here or there, but probably not."" 
Trump's politically charged decision to send U.S. troops to the border with Mexico came ahead of U.S. congressional elections last week, as Trump sought to strengthen border security as part of a crackdown on illegal immigration.
Trump's supporters, including Republicans in Congress, have embraced the deployment. 
But critics say it was designed to drive Republican voters to the polls. They have scoffed at Trump's comparison of caravans of Central American migrants, including women and children, fleeing poverty and violence, to an ""invasion.""
Mattis defended the deployment on Wednesday, saying the mission was ""absolutely legal,"" justified and was improving military readiness. 
Speaking in Washington, Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan said the troop numbers had largely peaked.
""We're pretty much peaked in terms of the number of people that are down there,"" Shanahan said. 
'RIGHTSIZING'
Buchanan also said his mission guidelines were clear - to support CBP personnel. He said his work was apolitical. 
""I'm not being directed to do anything unnatural from above me,"" said Buchanan, who is commander of U.S. Army North.
The Pentagon says there are no plans for U.S. forces to interact with migrants and that they have been carrying out support tasks for CBP, like stringing up concertina wire and building temporary housing for themselves and CBP personnel.
In recent days, up to 1,000 migrants linked to the caravans have arrived in the Mexican border city of Tijuana, with a similar number expected to arrive in the next few days. Thousands more could arrive in border towns over the coming days as the bulk of the caravans arrive.
Buchanan estimated that about 5,800 troops were deployed in total, with about 1,500 in California, 1,500 in Arizona and 2,800 in Texas. He acknowledged he might shift forces east or west along the border if needed.
Mattis told reporters that U.S. soldiers were making rapid progress erecting barriers along the border and estimated the first, construction phase of the U.S. military effort could be completed within 10 days.
Buchanan suggested troops would go home once they had fulfilled requests by CBP.
""At some point in time, I'm not going to keep troops here just to keep them here. When the work is done, we’re going to start downsizing some capability,"" he said. 
Buchanan would need to make any recommendations on redeployment of troops to General Terrence O'Shaughnessy, the head of U.S. Northern Command. O'Shaughnessy would then report to Mattis.
He suggested a recommendation could be made in the near future.

""I'm looking as early as next week to start thinking through rightsizing, if we need to change. Or do I need to shift (troops elsewhere on the border),"" Buchanan said, without predicting when changes might occur.

Kadyrov, a former anti-Russian rebel turned pro-Russian politician, was suspended from Facebook and Instagram in December last year, soon after he was placed on a U.S. sanctions list for alleged rights abuses.
He has long used both social media platforms, especially Instagram where he has amassed more than 3 million followers with regular photos of his life and posts of his views.
Screenshots shared widely on social media showed that his Instagram account was back up on Wednesday and remained live for at least eight hours. After his first new post - a photo of himself holding a gun and wearing protective glasses - it was blocked once again. 
Instagram, which is owned by  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), did not reply to a request for comment.
""On Wednesday my @kadyrov_95 Instagram page was unblocked. Justice has prevailed. It took about 11 months to achieve,"" Kadyrov wrote on his public feed of another app, Telegram, where he has 40,000 subscribers.
""All that time, millions of my subscribers were denied the opportunity to receive information first hand,"" Kadyrov wrote on Telegram, before his Instagram feed was blocked again.
During his brief foray back on Instagram, he included an ode to his pistol alongside the photo.
""GUN. How much I need to say about you, my friend. As if in this silence there is only you and I,"" Kadyrov posted.
U.S. authorities accuse Kadyrov, who has been in charge of the majority-Muslim region of southern Russia since 2007, of overseeing ""an administration involved in disappearances and extrajudicial killings"". 
Rights groups and Western governments allege that authorities in Chechnya repress their political opponents, discriminate against women and persecute gays, all allegations that Chechnya's leaders deny.

Chechnya was brought to heel by Russia after two wars against pro-independence rebels there in the 1990s which killed tens of thousands of people and reduced the region's towns and cities to rubble. The capital Grozny has since been lavishly rebuilt.

PARADISE, Calif. (Reuters) - Firefighting crews made progress against the deadliest wildfire in California history on Thursday amid concerns that the death toll of 56 would rise as search teams work their way through the burned-out town of Paradise in the state's north.
More than 9,000 personnel from many U.S. states are fighting the Camp Fire, which incinerated Paradise, and the Woolsey Fire hundreds of miles to the south.
Authorities attributed the high number of casualties to the staggering speed with which the wind-driven flames blew through Paradise. Nearly 8,700 homes were destroyed and 15,500 buildings threatened, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said on Thursday. 
Cal Fire said that 40 percent of the Camp Fire had been contained, up from 35 percent, even as the blaze grew 2,000 acres to 140,000 acres (57,000 hectares).
Diminished winds and rising humidity helped firefighters shore up containment lines on Wednesday.
U.S. National Guard troops are in Paradise looking for remains of victims as 130 people, most over the age of 65, were still listed as missing. 
Authorities fear that in the crush to flee the fast-approaching flames, some elderly residents may have been left behind. At least 22 cadaver dogs are part of the search.
Paradise's ghostly expanse of empty lots covered in ash and strewn with twisted wreckage and debris made a strong impression on Governor Jerry Brown, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and other officials who toured the devastation on Wednesday and were due to visit the scene of the Woolsey Fire on Thursday.
Paradise, in the Sierra foothills about 175 miles (280 km) north of San Francisco, burned last Thursday and its 27,000 residents are unsure of what to do next. With 50,000 people still under evacuation orders, a Walmart (NYSE:WMT) that had been spared from the fire has become a haven for fire refugees. 
A section of its parking lot was roped off for use as a distribution center for clothes, food and coffee, while people who fled their homes set up dozens of tents in an adjacent field or slept in their cars in the parking lot. Portable toilets were brought in.
Evacuees milling in the parking lot were facing morning temperatures that dropped into the mid-30s and many wore breathing masks for protection from lingering smoke.
At another evacuation center south of Paradise in Oroville, Nanette Benson, said her future is uncertain.
""We don't know where the hell we're going to go,"" she told KRCR TV.
LOOTING IN PARADISE
Paradise's police department stepped up patrols after arresting three people on charges of looting. The department is relying on equipment from other police departments and is running off a generator, Sergeant Steve Bertagna told KRCR TV. 
Thirteen of the department's 30 officers have lost their homes, KRCR TV said.
The blaze, fueled by thick, drought-desiccated scrub, has capped two back-to-back catastrophic wildfire seasons in California that scientists largely ascribe to prolonged drought that is symptomatic of climate change.
The high winds have eased, Cal Fire Director Ken Pimlott told reporters late on Wednesday, but vegetation around the Camp Fire remained critically dry and conditions were dangerous.
Lawyers for some wildfire victims claimed in a lawsuit filed this week that lax equipment maintenance by an electric utility caused the fire, which officially remains under investigation.
The Butte County disaster coincided with blazes in Southern (NYSE:SO) California, especially the Woolsey Fire, which has killed at least two people, destroyed more than 500 structures and displaced 200,000 people west of Los Angeles.
Cal Fire said the Woolsey Fire was about 57 percent contained on Wednesday, up from 52 percent. Crews battling the fire were hoping for a help from the weather on Thursday with light onshore winds expected to bring slightly cooler temperatures and higher humidity levels.
The Camp Fire also stands as one of the deadliest U.S. wildfires since the turn of the last century. More than 80 people perished in the Big Burn firestorm that swept the northern Rockies in August 1910, consuming 3 million acres.

1119,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 11:23AM ET</span>",Saudi Arabia seeks death penalty in Khashoggi murder case,"By Stephen Kalin, Marwa Rashad and Tuvan Gumrukcu
RIYADH/ANKARA (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor is seeking the death penalty for five suspects charged in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as the kingdom tries to contain its biggest political crisis for a generation.
Khashoggi, a royal insider turned critic of Saudi policy, was killed in the country's Istanbul consulate on Oct. 2, after a struggle, by lethal injection, deputy public prosecutor and spokesman Shalaan al-Shalaan told reporters on Thursday.
Shalaan said that de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman knew nothing of the operation, in which Khashoggi's body was dismembered, removed from the building and handed over to an unidentified ""local cooperator"".
The whereabouts of Khashoggi's remains are unknown, he said. His family is planning a weekend prayer service without his body.
Following Shalaan's account, the latest of Riyadh's shifting explanations, the U.S. Treasury will announce sanctions on 17 Saudis for their role in the killing, including Saud al-Qahtani, a former top aide to Prince Mohammed, and Istanbul Consul General Mohammed Alotaibi, a source familiar with the plan told Reuters.
Turkey, however, reacted with scepticism and a U.S. senator said it was unbelievable that the killing could not have been carried out without orders. France's foreign ministry, meanwhile, said the investigation was proceeding in the right direction.
The case has sparked a global outcry and tarnished the image of Prince Mohammed.
Shalaan said Khashoggi was murdered after ""negotiations"" for his return to the kingdom failed, and that the killing was ordered by the lead negotiator after he decided it was unfeasible to remove him from the consulate.
Shalaan said the order to repatriate Khashoggi came from former deputy intelligence chief Ahmed al-Asiri, who was sacked last month.
He said Prince Mohammed ""did not have any knowledge"" of the killing, a stance reiterated by Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, who accused Turkey of ignoring Saudi requests for information. 
SANCTIONS
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said the order for the operation came from the highest level of Saudi leadership but probably not King Salman, putting the spotlight instead on his 33-year-old heir.
U.S. President Donald Trump has suggested ultimate responsibility lies with the prince as de facto ruler and has warned of economic sanctions. Asked about that possibility, Jubeir said a distinction should be made between individuals who committed crimes and the government.
Riyadh initially denied any knowledge of Khashoggi's disappearance, then offered contradictory explanations including that he was killed in a rogue operation.
U.S. Democratic Senator Chris Coons dismissed that idea as ""utterly incredible"" and called for a U.S. investigation using information from Turkish intelligence and other sources. ""We should reach our own conclusions, rather than letting the Saudis come up with a different version of events,"" he said on CNN.
Some details provided on Thursday again contradicted previous versions, none of which mentioned a drug-induced death and one of which called the killing premeditated based on information provided by Turkey.
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the measures announced by Saudi Arabia were ""positive but insufficient"", and repeated Ankara's demand that the 15-man team be tried in Turkey.
An adviser to Erdogan accused Riyadh of trying to cover up the murder. ""I don't believe the real perpetrators will be found through Saudi Arabia's investigation,"" Yasin Aktay said.
DEATH PENALTY
Without naming them, Shalaan said the Saudi prosecutor had requested the death penalty for five individuals ""charged with ordering and committing the crime, and for the appropriate sentences for the other indicted individuals"".
He said 11 of 21 suspects have been indicted and will be referred to court, while investigations of the remaining suspects will continue.
He said a travel ban had been imposed on Qahtani, who coordinated with Asiri, meeting the operatives ahead of their journey to Istanbul to brief them on Khashoggi's activities.
Qahtani has already been fired from the royal court, but four sources based in the Gulf have told Reuters that he is still at liberty and continues to operate discreetly.
A senior government official previously identified the head of the negotiating team as Maher Mutreb, an aide to Qahtani who has appeared in photographs with Prince Mohammed on official foreign visits this year.
Six weeks after the murder, Turkey is trying to maintain pressure on Prince Mohammed, releasing a stream of evidence that undermined Riyadh's early denials.
Turkey says it has recordings related to the killing which it shared with Western allies. One Turkish official told Reuters that officials who heard the recordings, which include Khashoggi's killing and conversations leading up to the operation, were horrified but their countries had done nothing. 
Last month, two intelligence sources said Qahtani gave orders over Skype to Khashoggi's killers. More recently, a government source said Qahtani featured prominently throughout the recordings.

Erdogan has said Turkey also played the recordings to Saudi officials, something Shalaan declined to confirm or deny. He said Riyadh asked Ankara to share witness testimonies and hand over Khashoggi's phones.

After seven years of work on the high-speed railway line, King Mohammed VI and French President Emmanuel Macron boarded the train for the inaugural trip from Tangier to the capital Rabat.
The train, which was tested at a speed of 357 km (222 miles)per hour and is planned to run at 320 km (198 miles) per hour, will more than halve the 200 km (124 miles)Casablanca-Tangier journey to around two hours. It is about twice as fast as South Africa's high-speed Gautrain linking Johannesburg's international airport to the city's financial district Sandton.
The high-speed line was completed at a total cost of 22.9 billion dirhams ($2.4 billion), according to state news agency MAP. Transport officials were not immediately available for comment.
Morocco bought 12 double-decker high-speed-trains from French group  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) that will be operated by state-owned railway ONCF which expects six million passengers on the new train service annually. 
Officials have said the project will boost growth in Tangier and help attract more investments to northern Morocco where one of Africa’s largest ports is located.
But critics perceive the project as symbolizing a two-speed Morocco further accentuating disparities between territories as vast regions in the south and key cities such as Agadir remain without a basic train service.

A train derailment last month near Kenitra 15 km (10 miles) north of Rabat, which killed seven people and injured 125 others, triggered calls for a better allocation of resources by giving priority to improving safety and infrastructure as well as punctuality of basic railway services.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Thousands of Syrians are trapped by battles or face hard choices about returning home even though relative calm has held in the northwest for two months, the United Nations said on Thursday.
Seven and a half years of war have left most remaining rebel forces boxed into northwestern Idlib province. 
Neighboring Turkey and Russia hatched a de-escalation plan for Idlib that stalled a Syrian government offensive which the U.N. said would have caused a humanitarian catastrophe.
The past two months in Idlib have been the quietest in five years with no air raids, said U.N. humanitarian adviser Jan Egeland. But there is still shelling along the Idlib perimeter, and the 2-3 million civilians and 12,000 humanitarian workers there did not know if the lull would hold.
""There are many signs that bad things will happen unless there are further breakthroughs in the negotiations with the numerous armed groups inside,"" Egeland told reporters after a regular U.N. humanitarian meeting on Syria.
""The worst case scenario is still horrific war across enormous areas but the way that Russia and Turkey tell us of their plans ... makes me a cautious optimist. I don't see the big war coming any time soon to Idlib.""
Both Russia and Turkey had said they would go to great lengths to avoid military action if their own positions were not attacked. 
But thousands of rebels, including fighters listed by the U.N. as terrorists, remain in Idlib and Egeland said there are few signs of them negotiating or laying down their arms or seeking amnesty.
Another 40,000 civilians are trapped, with a few thousand armed men, in Rukban, a desolate camp on Syria's border with Jordan. A 78-truck convoy reached them with aid supplies this month and Egeland said another is planned by mid-December.
Russia, the United States and Jordan had coordinated to calm the conflict to allow the convoy into the camp, where the situation was horrific, and the priority now was a deal to remove the six armed groups operating in the area, Egeland said.
Air raids have continued in eastern Deir al-Zor governorate, where U.S.-led and Kurdish forces are targeting Islamic State fighters. Egeland said camps of rescued civilians must be moved out of harm's way, and one was torched by Islamic State.
Millions of Syrian refugees are also facing the challenge of reclaiming their homes within a year, under a law promulgated on Sunday.
""Imagine being a single mother in a tent in (Lebanon's) Bekaa Valley – how do you do that?""
Egeland said there should be a new version that did not take land from civilians, an awareness campaign, and suspension of implementation in the meantime, and Russia supported that work.

Some Syrian cities were smashed like Stalingrad or Dresden, and there was not much to return to, Egeland said.

1123,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 10:17AM ET</span>",Macron braces for motorist revolt on France's highways,"By Sarah White
PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron, hit by a slump in popularity, faces a nationwide protest this weekend over rising fuel taxes that threatens to gridlock France's roads and show the depth of discontent with his reforms to reshape the economy.
Dubbed the ""yellow vest"" movement, demonstrators are threatening to block motorways and access roads to some oil depots, including in Calais near the Channel Tunnel, a major passenger and freight link into Britain. 
The protest is the latest confrontation between Macron and voters in the countryside and provincial cities which view the former investment banker as the representative of an urban elite out of touch with ordinary people.
In 18 months in power, Macron has stared down muscular trade unions and street demonstrations as he liberalized labor laws and overhauled the heavily indebted state rail operator SNCF, unflinching in his resolve to bring economic and social renewal.
He has tried to shrug off accusations he is a ""president of the rich"", a tag milked by rivals after he scrapped a wealth tax. This time his administration - which appeared caught off guard by how fast the protest movement grew as word spread on social media - has sought to soothe poorer motorists.
""I hear the anger, and it's a fundamental right in our society to be allowed to express it,"" Macron said in a television interview late on Wednesday. 
But he added the protest movement, embraced by Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Rally party and receiving tentative support from other parties on the left and right, had been hijacked by opponents and their supporters bent on obstructing reforms without a clear vision of their own.
The price of diesel, the most commonly used car fuel in France, at the pump increased by 20 percent in the past year to an average of 1.49 euros ($1.68)/liter, according to website http://www.carbu.com. 
The higher taxes, approved in late 2017, started biting as oil prices surged in October though they have eased off somewhat since. 
""WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE DOUGH?""
Increases in taxes on gasoline and tobacco as well as an increase to a social welfare levy before other tax cuts came into force left many voters feeling Macron's reforms had eroded their purchasing power. 
Their anger is reflected in opinion polls showing support for Macron falling to new lows of 21 percent. 
The government is standing firm on the fuel tax hikes but on Wednesday announced a 500 million euro plan to help motorists with the lowest incomes, seeking to take the sting out of the protest movement.
The diesel tax increases are designed to encourage drivers to switch to more environmentally-friendly automobile models, part of Macron's ""energy transition"" plan. 
But critics say that while the government hits people's wallets, it lacks a clear vision on switching to greener energy sources, citing foot-dragging by Macron's administration on reducing France's reliance on nuclear power. Rural voters are also angered by a speed limit reduction on countryside roads.
""What do you do with the dough, aside from changing the crockery at the Elysee palace or building yourselves swimming pools?"" exclaimed Brittany resident Jacline Mouraud in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post viewed more than six million times. 

""If that's what the money is used for, we might as well change, there's no point in you staying on.""

1124,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 09:52AM ET</span>","As India eases citizenship path for Hindus, Rohingya Muslims fear expulsion","By Zeba Siddiqui
JODHPUR/JAIPUR, India (Reuters) - Nar Singh can vividly recall the day in 2014 when Narendra Modi promised to provide refuge to Hindus suffering around the world. The 39-year-old shop owner sat awestruck inside his two-bedroom house in Pakistan's eastern Mirpur Khas district, as Modi's voice boomed from the television during his successful campaign to become India's prime minister.
""If there are atrocities on Hindus in Fiji, where will they go? Should they not come to India? If Hindus are persecuted in Mauritius, where should they go? Hindustan!"" Modi declared to a roaring crowd.
For Singh, whose grandfather had been born in British-ruled India before the bloody partition that led to the creation of Pakistan in 1947, Modi's words resonated deeply. ""He spoke so wholeheartedly, it felt like a warm invitation,"" said Singh. ""I was so proud and happy.""
Living in Muslim-majority Pakistan, where Hindus say they often face religious discrimination and hate crimes, Singh had always felt drawn toward India. Seven months ago, he and his family stepped off a train in India's border state of Rajasthan with a 25-day pilgrimage visa and no intention of returning. They now live in a hut on government-owned land on the outskirts of Jodhpur city, alongside about 150 other Hindu families from Pakistan.
He is hopeful he will be granted Indian citizenship - a process that, for immigrants such as Singh, would become much easier under a bill likely to be debated in India's parliament next month. Drafted by the Modi administration, it would tweak the law to relax rules for Hindus and other non-Muslim minorities from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh to become Indian citizens.
Critics say the bill is blatantly anti-Muslim and have called it an attempt by the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to increase its Hindu voter base ahead of a national election next year. Protests have erupted in recent weeks in the border state of Assam, where a movement against illegal immigrants from Bangladesh has simmered for decades.
CONTRASTING FORTUNES
While the BJP denies the bill is discriminatory, it offers no concessions to Muslim asylum-seekers, whatever their predicament. That is evident in the tourist city of Jaipur, some 200 miles east of Singh's new home in Jodhpur, where about 80 Muslim Rohingya families eking out a living share none of his optimism.
The group, among the estimated 40,000 Rohingya who live in India after fleeing waves of violence in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, have recently been asked to submit personal details that they fear will be used to deport them back to the country where they say they face persecution.
""We have no option but to fill these out,"" said 38-year-old Rohingya community leader Noor Amin as he looked at a stack of forms handed to them by police last week.
Amin fled Myanmar in 2008, when he says his madrassa was shut down by the authorities and harsh restrictions on travel for Rohingya made it impossible for him to continue studying. 
Bouts of violence in Myanmar's western Rakhine state have continued for many years, culminating in a sweeping military campaign unleashed in August 2017 in response to militant attacks. That crackdown has forced more than 720,000 Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh, in what the United Nations' human rights agency has called ""a textbook example of ethnic cleansing"". Myanmar has denied almost all the accusations made by refugees against its troops, who it said engaged in legitimate counterinsurgency operations.   
The Modi government has said the Rohingya in India are illegal immigrants and a security threat. It deported the first seven Rohingya men back to Myanmar last month, despite warnings by rights groups that conditions in Myanmar were not safe for their return and the move was a violation of international law.
""They were sending a message to the whole world about what they really think about us,"" said Sayadi Alam, another Rohingya leader in Jaipur.
Alam fled Myanmar a decade ago, hoping for a better life in India. Like many of the Rohingya in Jaipur, he started off picking up scrap and selling it for recycling, but now he drives an electric rickshaw.  
""We are not asking for citizenship. We are not asking for anything more,"" he said. ""Just let us stay here. At least don't send us back to Myanmar.""
Such is the fear of deportation among the Rohingya in India that some families have fled for Bangladesh in recent weeks, according to community leaders in the capital New Delhi. 
CITIZENSHIP LAW 
If the Modi government bill passes, critics say it would for the first time seal into law the ruling party's disregard for Muslims, and take the BJP a step closer to achieving its often-stated ambition to make India a Hindu nation. 
""On the one hand the government says it doesn't want illegal immigrants. Then why are they taking X refugees and not Y?"" said Tridivesh Maini, a foreign policy analyst with the Jindal School of International Affairs. 
Arun Chaturvedi, a BJP minister in Rajasthan, defended the bill, saying it was meant for persecuted minorities from specific countries. ""This is not a dustbin,"" he said. ""Everyone cannot come here to claim citizenship. Rohingyas have to be deported because they are staying here illegally."" 
Modi set up a task force shortly after coming to power in 2014 to speed up the process of granting Pakistani Hindus citizenship. In 2016 the government gave seven states, including Rajasthan, powers to issue citizenship to Hindus and other religious minorities from neighboring Muslim countries, and allowed them to seek driving licenses and national identity cards.
As a result, the number of Pakistani nationals who received Indian citizenship rose to 855 in 2017 from 508 in 2015, according to home ministry data. The number getting long-term visas increased to 4,712 in 2017 from 890 in 2015.
Immigrants like Singh are a meaningful vote base for the BJP. Of the roughly 500,000 Pakistani Hindus who have arrived in Rajasthan since the India-Pakistan war of 1965, some 200,000 are now registered voters, said Hindu Sodha, who runs the Seemant Lok Sangathan non-profit for Pakistani Hindus out of Jodhpur. 
India is home to hundreds of thousands of immigrants and refugees, but does not have a legal framework for dealing with them and has not signed the 1951 UN Convention for Refugees. Successive governments have dealt with immigrants on an ad hoc basis.
While the citizenship bill has been pegged as a humanitarian effort by the Modi government, some experts said the government would draft a refugee policy or sign the convention if it was serious about the issue.
""Hindus from Pakistan will understandably seek refuge in India, and they deserve to get citizenship, but that doesn't mean you turn a blind eye to the fate of other oppressed communities,"" said Maini. 
It is unclear how many Hindus move to India, but until 2014 that number was roughly 5,000 a year, said Ramesh Vankwani, patron of the Karachi-based Pakistan Hindu Council and a politician in the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf. 
Many of those living around Singh's settlement told stories of harassment and discrimination in Pakistan to explain their move. 
One recent afternoon, Singh scrolled through photos on his smartphone of his life back home: a shiny white sedan, fully stocked general stores, and several acres of land.
Singh now sews t-shirts at a factory. He recently fulfilled his father's dying wish by immersing his ashes in the Ganges, a river considered holy in Hinduism.
Water is scarce, and there is no electricity in the area yet. Still, he says he is much happier than he was in Pakistan.
""I had a big house and lived comfortably, but there was no mental peace because there was no freedom of religion,"" he said. ""We can be accused of blasphemy any time there. We cannot wear what we want, and our women are not safe there.""

1125,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 09:49AM ET</span>","Exclusive: At U.N. climate talks, Trump team plans sideshow on coal","By Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration plans to set up a side-event promoting fossil fuels at the annual U.N. climate talks next month, repeating a strategy that infuriated global-warming activists during last year's talks, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.
As with the 2017 gathering in Bonn, Germany, the administration plans to highlight the benefits of technologies that more efficiently burn fuels including coal, the sources said.
This year's talks in Katowice, Poland - located in a mining region that is among the most polluted in Europe - are intended to hammer out a rule book to the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change, which set a sweeping goal of ending the fossil-fuel era this century by spurring a trillion-dollar transition to cleaner energy sources such as solar and wind power. 
Even as the Trump administration aims to promote energy strategies that could detract from those international goals, it also plans to let State Department officials continue negotiating the climate accord - a recognition that the next U.S. president may drop the nation's opposition to the pact. 
""The White House seems to have taken the view that it's important to let technocrats complete the work of the rule book. It's in the U.S. national interest to be at the table and see an outcome that emphasizes transparency, holds countries accountable,"" said one of the sources, who is familiar with State Department plans.
The White House and the State Department did not respond to requests for comment.
The United States, the world's top oil and gas producer, is the only country to have announced its intention to formally withdraw from the Paris accord. 
The administration's resistance has come against a backdrop of increasingly urgent warnings from scientists about the threats posed by greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels. The panel will come less than two months after the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned in a report that the world's use of coal for generating power will need to be nearly eliminated by mid-century – to between 1 and 7 percent of the global mix, from around 40 percent now - to help prevent deadly droughts, storms and floods brought on by climate change.
""Quite frankly, the U.S. is the only party to the convention that appears to be willing to push a rational discussion on the role of cleaner, more efficient fossil (fuels) and the role of civilian nuclear energy,"" said one of the sources, who is involved in the planning of the event for Katowice, likely to be held on Dec. 10.
The source, who did not want to be named due to the sensitive nature of the issue, said the event will be dominated by proponents of coal and natural gas and likely advanced nuclear power, too. The panel will also likely feature a U.S. Energy Department representative. At this point plans do not include a renewable power industry representative, the source said. 
The event is expected to be led by Wells Griffith, Trump's international energy and climate adviser, the sources added. Griffith's main energy policy experience involves a year at a political job at the Department of Energy and helping to set up a deal last year to supply Ukraine with U.S. coal after the country lost control of mines to Russian-backed separatists.
TWO-TIERED APPROACH
Trump last year announced his intent to leave the Paris agreement, calling it harmful to the U.S. economy and casting doubt on the climate science underpinning the accord. 
As per U.N. rules, Trump's administration will not be able to leave the pact until a day after the 2020 presidential election, and U.S. officials recognize that finishing the rule book and making sure developing countries such as China are held to verifiable emissions cuts are in the national interest. 
Last year, the fossil fuels event set up by the White House drew widespread protest and condemnation from climate activists. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg wrote on Twitter that ""Promoting coal at a climate summit is like promoting tobacco at a cancer summit.""
At the same time, 40 career officials from the State Department and other agencies continued their work on the Paris pact's rule book. U.S. envoys to the Bonn talks were viewed by their counterparts as constructive and helpful, feeding hopes that the United States could eventually be drawn back into the accord, a possibility that Trump has held open. 
But much has changed since last year.
Several Trump administration officials who supported keeping the United States in the Paris pact, although under different terms, have left the administration. They include top economic adviser Gary Cohn, national security adviser H.R. McMaster, and climate and energy adviser George David Banks. Now, economic adviser Larry Kudlow and national security adviser John Bolton are opponents of the Paris agreement, and Banks has been replaced by Griffith.
Ex-CIA director Mike Pompeo, a vocal critic of efforts to combat global warming by past U.S. administrations, has become Secretary of State, replacing former  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) CEO Rex Tillerson, who supported U.S. participation in the Paris agreement. 
That places Trump's team more squarely behind his ""energy dominance"" agenda of boosting U.S. fossil fuel output and exports, in part by promoting low-emission technology for fossil fuels to other nations.
The Energy Department has touted technologies including small scale ""modular"" coal plants that could burn the fuel more efficiently and step in when clouds and calm weather limit solar and wind power.
Environmentalists should not get excited that any State Department cooperation in Poland signals the Trump administration is eyeing a return to the Paris agreement, one of the sources said.

""It's making sure U.S. interests are paramount, nothing more, nothing less.""

Islamist ""financial facilitator"" Waleed Ahmed Zein paid the Allied Democratic Forces at least once, said the report from New York University's Congo Research Group and the Bridgeway Foundation that cited U.S. sources and an ADF defector.
Zein is on a U.S. government sanctions list and was arrested in his home country of Kenya in July for links to Islamic State. The payments were made in recent years but it was not clear when, how much was paid or how the money was used.
The Congolese government blames the ADF for a series of massacres in the last two years in the east of the country where violence around the city of Beni has hobbled efforts to contain an Ebola outbreak.
The ADF was set up by Ugandan Muslims in the 1990s purporting to fight for the rights of the Tablighi Jamaat sect, although it turned to banditry after crossing Uganda's western border with Congo. 
The Congolese and Ugandan governments accuse the ADF of links with jihadists like al Qaeda but has offered little evidence to back up these claims.
The payment was made as the ADF seeks to align itself with Islamic State, Nigeria-based Boko Haram and al Qaeda and other groups.
""The ADF appear to be ... becoming more interested in broadcasting their messages to a wider ... audience and are attempting to present themselves within a broader setting of radical jihadi groups,"" the report said. 
Links between the ADF and other groups are not yet strong, it said. Reuters was unable to independently verify the findings of the report. 
To reach a wider audience, the ADF has made propaganda videos which feature a flag similar to Islamic State's and broadcast in Luganda, Arabic, French, Kinyarwanda and Swahili, the region's most widely spoken language. They call for martyrdom and violence against infidels, the report said. 
Rival militia groups control parts of eastern Congo, long after the official end of a 1998-2003 war in which millions of people died, mostly from hunger and disease. 
Rights groups say the army is responsible for at least some of the recent killings in eastern Congo.

The July 30 poll was the first after Robert Mugabe was forced to resign following a coup in November 2017. In the aftermath of the vote, civilians died in an army crackdown on opposition protests. 
Chamisa lost a legal challenge to the election results but still maintains the vote was rigged and that Mnangagwa lacks legitimacy. 
A commission of inquiry led by former South African president Kgalema Motlante has heard evidence from security chiefs who this week denied soldiers had killed civilians and blamed Chamisa and other opposition leaders for inciting violence.
Video from the Aug. 1 protests showed soldiers, some with their faces obscured by camouflage masks, opening fire with automatic weapons.
Chamisa said he and former finance minister Tendai Biti were among leaders of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) who on Thursday received letters calling them to appear before the commission when it resumes hearings next week. 
""If they are to be fair, what's good for the goose must be good for the gander, they must be able to invite Mr Mnangagwa. If he is not going to go, why should I go alone?"" Chamisa said to reporters at the MDC's headquarters in Harare.
Police chief Godwin Matanga on Tuesday told the commission that Chamisa could be arrested any time for inciting violence. Chamisa said this was part of pressure on him to recognize Mnangagwa as president.

1130,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 07:20AM ET</span>","After 2,000 miles they crossed the U.S. border; then tragedy struck","By Andrew Hay and Lucy Nicholson
TUCSON, Ariz./AGUACATE, Guatemala (Reuters) - The 911 emergency call came in to the U.S. Border Patrol's Tucson station around midnight.
Joselino Gomez Esteban's voice crackled through an older cell phone from somewhere in Arizona's Sonoran Desert, the final stretch of a 2,000-mile (3,218 km) migration from Guatemala. 
    Gomez said he was lost. He needed help. His nephew had collapsed, wouldn't respond.
Each year hundreds of migrants die trying to cross into the United States from Mexico. Thousands more need rescuing. The Border Patrol tallied 294 deaths in fiscal year 2017, the last year for which data is available. But experts believe the actual figure is far higher. Some who die are never found.
A quarter of those known deaths - 72 people - came in the Tucson border sector, where summer temperatures routinely hit triple digits. Between October of 2017 and October of 2018, the Tucson Border Patrol launched 923 rescue operations, a 22 percent rise from a year before, according to an agency official.
    Finding Gomez, 43, and his nephew, Misael Paiz, 25, would prove difficult. The cell phone Gomez used did not provide his GPS coordinates. Using the cell phone towers that transmitted the 911 emergency call did little to help; the signal had bounced off towers up to 100 miles (161 km) away.
Headquartered in a modern two-story brown brick building, the Tucson Border Patrol sector is responsible for 262 miles (422 km) of sweeping desert, canyons and cactus-studded hills. Gomez and Paiz could have been anywhere in this territory. Agents were not even certain they were on the U.S. side of the border.
The sector has a staff of 4,200 at its disposal, backed by helicopters and unarmed drones, with technology ranging from motion and image sensors to cameras able to spot migrants from seven miles (11 km) away. It is one of the busiest sectors on the border for apprehensions and rescues of illegal migrants as well as seizures of marijuana. More than twice a day, on average, agents launch rescue missions. 
   At times, rescues turn to recovery efforts. Deaths come mostly from heat stroke in summer, hypothermia in winter. The dead are taken to the Pima County medical examiner's office.
“We see this day in and day out,” said Greg Hess, the county's chief medical examiner.
    Sometimes only bones are recovered; sometimes identifications are impossible. When they can, the office arranges for the return of remains to family members back home.
       
   'SOON, IT WILL BE MY TURN'
    Two weeks earlier, Gomez and Paiz had set off from Aguacate, a struggling Guatemalan farming town of 1,500 people near the Mexican border. The following account is based on more than two dozen interviews with family members, government officials, border patrol agents and human rights workers. 
    Paiz, a restaurant cook who had worked in Mexico, hoped to find work in the United States and send money back home. His uncle, Gomez, planned to join his wife and three children in South Carolina. He had been deported two years earlier and tried and failed three times since to make it back. This would be his fourth attempt. 
    ""The family is disintegrating because here we don’t have work,"" said Paiz's father, Miguel Domingo Paiz, 59.
Domingo knows that leaving for a better future is a life-or-death gamble. His eldest son Ovidio was shot dead in Mexico last year after moving there to find a job. 
    In recent years, the number of Guatemalans caught crossing illegally into the United States has risen steadily from about 57,000 in 2015 to nearly 117,000 in 2018, and is second only to apprehensions of Mexicans. The figures, experts say, reflect a greater willingness among Guatemalans to brave the perils of migration to escape rising violence, poverty and political turmoil. 
    Paiz told his twin brother, Gaspar, that he made an initial payment of $500 to a smuggler - known as a ""coyote"" - who promised to get him across the border. He would owe another $5,500 if he made it. 
After making their way to the Mexican town of Sasabe on the border with Arizona, Paiz and Gomez waited 12 days for their turn to cross with a guide, according to family members.
In one of their last phone conversations, Paiz told his father: ""Soon it will be my turn.""
    
PLEASE PRAY 
After crossing and walking for about six hours, Paiz began to complain of a severe headache. He collapsed next to a dirt track called Cemetery Road. 
    Their guide poured water over Paiz's head. When that didn't help, he took off with three other migrants in their group. Gomez stayed with his nephew. 
    Gomez's efforts to revive his nephew failed. He called family members in Aguacate, told Paiz's mother to pray. Then, knowing it would mean another failed attempt to rejoin his family, Gomez placed the 911 call.
    At first light on Sept. 10, helicopters launched by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Pima County started scouring known migrant paths in the area. An elite Border Patrol medical unit set out across the desert.
    Following the 911 dispatcher's instruction, Gomez lit a fire in the hope that it could guide the rescuers. But it burned hot and clean, producing little smoke.
    It wasn't until 1:30 that afternoon that agents got word that a rancher had happened across the two men.
    A short while later, Border Patrol agents reached the location and took Gomez into custody. 
They took Paiz away in a black body bag.
A CONCRETE TOMB    
The Pima County Medical Examiner would later determine Paiz succumbed to heat stroke. Seven weeks after his death, Paiz's body was flown to Guatemala City, a journey paid for by the Guatemalan government. His coffin arrived along with a half dozen others, all bearing remains of Guatemalan migrants.
   A Red Cross ambulance transported Paiz's body on the 12-hour drive along primitive roads from the capital to Aguacate. His family followed behind in a bus.
    ""We always played together. We would go to the mountains together to collect wood,"" said Gaspar, his twin. ""We discussed which one of us would go to the U.S. and decided it would be Misael.""    
    In Aguacate, some 250 people met the ambulance transporting Paiz's body. They stood in ankle-deep mud and pouring rain as eight men lifted his coffin out and took it into the family home.
    For hours, Paiz's mother, brothers and sisters wailed while others sang in a room illuminated by a single electric bulb hanging from the ceiling.
    The following morning, a band played marimba music next to the coffin in Paiz's family home. A woman cooked a pot of stew on a wood-burning stove.
    Paiz was buried that afternoon in a concrete tomb on a hillside, next to his elder brother Ovidio.

1131,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 06:15AM ET</span>",European court says Kremlin critic Navalny was a political prisoner,"By Gilbert Reilhac and Andrew Osborn
STRASBOURG/MOSCOW (Reuters) - The European Court of Human Rights ruled on Thursday that Russia's repeated arrests and detention of opposition leader Alexei Navalny were politically-motivated and breached his human rights, a decision certain to displease the Kremlin. 
The court, based in Strasbourg, said Navalny had been subject to seven such arrests in 2012 and in 2014 and that at least two of those arrests had been designed to suppress political pluralism.
""The Court found that there was 'converging contextual evidence' that the authorities were becoming increasingly severe towards Mr Navalny and that his allegation of being a particular target appeared coherent in the context of a general move to bring the opposition under control,"" it said in a statement.
It ordered Russia to pay around 64,000 euros in damages and costs to Navalny. 
Navalny, Russia's most prominent opposition leader, was barred from running against Vladimir Putin in a presidential election earlier this year and has been repeatedly jailed for organizing what the authorities say are illegal protests.
Putin, who makes a point of never pronouncing Navalny's name in public, has suggested that Navalny is backed by the United States and would destabilize Russia if he came to power. 
Navalny likens Putin to an autocratic Tsar, saying he has been in power for too long and oversees a political system rife with corruption.
Navalny, who was in Strasbourg for the ruling, welcomed the court's decision.
""It's a very fair judgment,"" he told reporters. ""... (It) is very important not just for me but also for other people all over Russia who are arrested every day.""
Russia did not react immediately but is likely to appeal the ruling.

The ruling is likely to strain already poor relations between Russia and the Strasbourg-based court which has repeatedly ruled against Moscow, prompting Russian officials to talk about the possibility of quitting its jurisdiction.

The races are among about a dozen high-profile contests that remained unresolved. But the outstanding races will not tip the balance in Congress after Democrats took control of the U.S. House of Representatives and Republicans extended their majority in the U.S. Senate in the Nov. 6 vote.
A high-profile recount of votes continued in Florida, where initial vote tallies showed outgoing Republican Governor Rick Scott leading in the race for a U.S. Senate seat and Republican Ron DeSantis leading to succeed Scott as governor. Both had narrow margins of victory within 0.5 percentage point, the state threshold requiring machine recounts, which began five days ago.
If the recount finds that Scott's margin of victory over Democratic incumbent Senator Bill Nelson or DeSantis' margin over Democrat Andrew Gillum is at 0.25 percentage point or lower, a second round of recounts conducted by hand would begin. 
In Utah, Republican first-term U.S. Representative Mia Love filed a lawsuit in Utah state court on Wednesday seeking to halt vote counting. She argued that election officials are not allowing poll monitors to challenge their findings during vote verification.
Love was trailing Democratic challenger Ben McAdams by around 1,200 votes, less than 1 percentage point, with some ballots still uncounted.
The lawsuit was brought against the county clerk in Salt Lake County, the only county of the four that are included in Utah's 4th congressional district where McAdams leads Love, according to a copy of the complaint.
""Love's decision to sue only in SLCo as she continues to trail in this race is unfortunate and smacks of desperation,"" McAdams said on Twitter.
Love's attorney, Robert Harrington, said in a statement, ""We are not accusing anyone of anything. Simply put, we have submitted this petition to improve the elections process.""
At least two other congressional races were resolved in Democrats' favor on Wednesday. In California, Republican Representative Jeff Denham, who represents a district east of San Jose, conceded to Democrat Josh Harder in a statement.

In New Jersey, Republican Representative Tom MacArthur, who represents a district in the southern part of the state, conceded to Democrat Andy Kim.

The detentions followed altercations on Wednesday between police and supporters of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), who were accompanying an election candidate who was picking up nomination papers from party offices in the city.
General elections are invariably volatile in Bangladesh, where politics has for more than two decades been dominated by the rivalry between two women leaders - Sheikh Hasina, the current prime minister, and former premier Khaleda Zia.
Those detained were identified through video footage of the Wednesday violence, Mohammad Asaduzzaman Mia, commissioner of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police, told reporters.
""We have identified half of them who were directly involved,"" Mia said, adding that at least 60 were held.
""All of them belong to the BNP or its different front organizations.""
Police accused the opposition supporters of attacking police and their vehicles. BNP leaders denied that.
Rizvi Ahmed, a senior joint secretary general of BNP, said it was all a plot by the government to stop the party from contesting the Dec. 30 election.
Obaydul Quader, general secretary of ruling Awami League, dismissed that.

Bangladesh's last election, in 2014, which the BNP boycotted, was marred by deadly violence and criticized by international observers as flawed.

1134,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 05:45AM ET</span>",Saudi-led coalition halts Hodeidah assault as West presses for Yemen ceasefire -sources,"By Mohammed Ghobari and Aziz El Yaakoubi
ADEN/DUBAI (Reuters) - The Saudi-led coalition has ordered a halt in its offensive against Iranian-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen's main port city of Hodeidah, three sources told Reuters on Thursday, in an apparent concession to Western pressure to end the war.
Key Western allies including the United States have been urgently calling for a ceasefire ahead of renewed U.N.-led peace efforts. The nearly four-year-old conflict has killed more than 10,000 people and caused a humanitarian disaster in an already impoverished Yemen. 
""The coalition has instructed forces on the ground to halt fighting inside Hodeidah,"" said one pro-coalition military source. A source in another military force backed by the coalition confirmed the order. 
A third non-military source with knowledge of the decision said the coalition was responding to international requests for a ceasefire to ensure the Houthis attend planned peace talks.
Hodeidah has become a key target for the Sunni Muslim coalition, which has been trying to oust the Houthis since 2015 after they took control of the capital Sanaa and overthrew the government. 
Western countries until recently provided arms and intelligence to the Saudi-led coalition, but toughened their stance on Yemen after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at Riyadh's consulate in Istanbul early last month.
The killing of Khashoggi sparked a global outcry and opened the kingdom to possible sanctions. It also prompted renewed scrutiny of the Saudi role in the conflict in Yemen, which is widely seen as a proxy war between Riyadh and Iran.
Coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki would not confirm the order to halt the offensive had been given, saying operations were ongoing in the Red Sea port city, a lifeline for millions of Yemenis suffering severe shortages of food and other basic goods and a key supply line for the Houthis.
The offensive, launched late last month, was the Sunni Muslim coalition's second attempt to retake the city in order to cut the Houthis' access to the port and force them to negotiate.
""Each operation has its own specifics and pace,"" the coalition spokesman told Reuters, without providing details. 
Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, a Houthi leader and member of the group's Supreme Revolutionary Committee, told Reuters it had still not seen an official announcement about a cessation of hostilities and that skirmishes continued in outer suburbs of Hodeidah.
MISERY AMID CALM
Street battles in Hodeidah have abated over the last three days and the city was calm on Thursday, residents said. Coalition warplanes have conducted intermittent air strikes, mostly in the evening.
""We heard some sporadic (mortar) shelling this morning, but it is very calm,"" said resident Arwa Mohammed. ""People have started to leave their houses and go outside. We don't want the fighting to resume as our situation is miserable.""
International aid groups have warned a full-scale assault on Hodeidah, which handles 80 percent of the impoverished country's food imports and aid supplies, would risk triggering a famine.
Some 22 million Yemenis, out of a population of 29 million, rely humanitarian aid, according to U.N. data. Almost 18 million are considered hungry and 8.4 million severely hungry.
The coalition abandoned its last attempt to capture Hodeidah last June without any gains amid concern about a humanitarian catastrophe.
Analysts say that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which is leading operations on the southern and western coast of Yemen, want to exit what has become a costly quagmire, but that any peace talks will have to overcome deep mistrust among all parties.
U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths is trying to salvage talks between the warring Yemeni parties after the last round in September collapsed when the Houthis did not show up.
He hopes to convene talks before the end of the year to agree a framework for peace under a transitional government.
Sweden is preparing to host consultations when the parties ""are ready to talk"", said a source familiar with the matter. ""I would describe the process as slightly positive. Steps have been taken during the last weeks towards peace talks."" 
UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash has welcomed an early resumption of talks, saying the alliance would raise the issue at a U.N. Security Council meeting on Friday.
""(The) coalition will urge all parties to take advantage of window of opportunity to restart political process,"" he wrote on Twitter on Wednesday.
There has been a military stalemate since the alliance seized the southern port city of Aden in 2015. While the coalition has air supremacy, the Houthis are better at guerrilla warfare.

1135,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 05:24AM ET</span>",Explainer: How does a leadership challenge to a Conservative UK prime minister work?,"LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May's position as leader of the Conservative Party - and consequently her premiership - is under threat after Brexit minister Dominic Raab resigned in protest at her proposed exit deal with the European Union. 
Below is an explanation of how May could face a leadership challenge under Conservative Party rules:
- WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN FOR THERE TO BE A LEADERSHIP CONTEST?
A challenge is triggered if 15 percent of the Conservative members of parliament (MPs) write letters demanding a confidence vote to the chairman of the party's ""1922 Committee"", which represents those lawmakers who have no government jobs.
The Conservatives have 315 MPs, so 48 would need to write such letters for a vote to be called.
- COULD THIS HAPPEN TO MAY?
Some eurosceptic MPs have publicly said they have submitted such letters in protest at her Brexit negotiating strategy. The number voicing concern rose after the publication of a draft withdrawal agreement on Wednesday and Raab's resignation on Thursday.
However, the 1922 Committee's chairman, Graham Brady, is the only person who knows how many have actually submitted letters, including those who have written to him confidentially.
Last month, Brady was reported as saying that some MPs claim to have submitted letters when, in fact, they have not. 
- WHAT HAPPENS DURING A CONFIDENCE VOTE?
All Conservative MPs can vote. May would need a simple majority of the total votes registered in order to win. If all elected lawmakers cast their ballots, that would currently mean 158 votes. 
If May wins, she remains in office and cannot be challenged again for 12 months. If she loses, she must resign and is barred from standing in the leadership election that follows.
- HOW QUICKLY CAN A VOTE TAKE PLACE?
Under Conservative rules, the vote is held as soon as possible, on a date decided by the 1922 Committee chairman in consultation with the party leader.
The last no-confidence vote against a Conservative leader, when the party was in opposition in 2003, was held the day after the Committee chairman announced he had received enough letters.
- WHAT HAPPENS IF MAY LOSES? 
There will be a leadership contest to decide her replacement. Her replacement will become prime minister, but a general election will not automatically be triggered.
If several candidates come forward, a secret vote is held among Conservative MPs to whittle down the field. The candidate with the fewest votes is removed and Conservative lawmakers vote again. The process is repeated, on Tuesdays and Thursdays, until only two candidates remain.
These two candidates are then put to a postal ballot of the wider Conservative Party membership. Participants need to have been party members for more than three months.
When David Cameron decided to step down as prime minister and Conservative leader after the EU referendum in 2016, five candidates came forward. The field was narrowed to May and then-junior minister Andrea Leadsom, but she pulled out before members voted, leaving May to become leader unopposed.
- WHO COULD REPLACE MAY?

The list of possible replacements is long, but there is no clear frontrunner. Many of those expected to run used the Conservative Party's annual conference last month to set out their platform and priorities for any leadership bid.

1138,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 05:11AM ET</span>",Exclusive: German prosecutors charge Chinese-born engineer in industrial espionage case,"By Patricia Weiss and Ludwig Burger
COLOGNE, Germany (Reuters) - German prosecutors are pressing criminal charges against a former employee of chemicals maker Lanxess for allegedly stealing trade secrets to set up a Chinese copycat chemical reactor.
The case underscores fears among German officials and executives about industrial espionage in Europe's largest manufacturing nation.
State prosecutors in the city of Cologne, where the company is headquartered, told Reuters they had brought criminal charges in June against a Chinese-born German national based on a complaint filed with police by Lanxess about two years ago.
There have been several reports in Germany of manufacturers with operations in China catching local staff doing work for copycat rivals. But the alleged data theft at Lanxess is a rare case in which a suspected leak has been identified at home.
German intelligence agency BfV in July warned companies in its annual report that China could resort to intellectual property theft as it aspires to become an exporter of high-tech products, adding that it is hard to distinguish between state and industrial espionage.
In the Lanxess case, which has not previously been reported, the 48-year-old engineer was fired when the company discovered the data theft related to a chemical reactor, prosecutors said.
A 40-year-old German associate, also of Chinese descent, who allegedly received the trade secrets via email and sought to commercially exploit them in China, is also being prosecuted, they added.
If convicted, the two face up to four years in prison. A third accomplice was allegedly also involved but prosecutors have no knowledge of his whereabouts.
Lanxess and the prosecutors' office declined to disclose the names of the accused.
Criminal defense lawyer Martin Buecher of Birkenstock Rechtsanwaelte, the Cologne-based law firm that represents both defendants in the criminal case, said their clients would not comment on the accusations. He declined to identify them.
Buecher said the case was highly complex and the prosecution was relying on assertions from Lanxess staff. The defense will seek external expert witnesses to be heard to ensure objectivity, he added.
In an online synopsis of an earlier civil lawsuit heard in a Duesseldorf court in February 2017, which two sources said involved the same alleged infringement, the unnamed man denied that the emailed data amounted to trade secrets.
The court ruled that he should pay damages of about 180,000 euros. An appellate court lowered the amount to around 167,000 euros, but ruled that the defendant was liable to compensate Lanxess for any future fallout from the infringement.
In a statement to Reuters, Lanxess said a group of employees of Chinese origin stole confidential information about a new, innovative product several years ago and tried to exploit it commercially.
""The main culprit was a former employee, who abused a position of trust and access to confidential business information,"" it said.
""Lanxess was able to secure evidence and is holding the perpetrators accountable in court. Lanxess therefore managed to avert damage from the business,"" it added. The company declined to provide further details of the case.
RARE LEAK AT HOME
Lanxess is a 2005 spin-off from German drugs and pesticides maker Bayer (DE:BAYGN).
Court filings from the civil lawsuit in Duesseldorf show that the firm accused the defendants of working on a 400 tonne-per-year chemical reactor in China and promoting the copied product globally.
Facing mature markets at home, European chemical companies have relied on the booming Chinese economy for much of their growth over the past decade.
But strong rivals are emerging there in markets such as farming pesticides, caprolactam for engineering plastics or liquid crystals for flat screens.
Lanxess, which makes additives, pesticide ingredients, construction pigments and engineering plastics, derived 28 percent of almost 10 billion euros in sales from Asia last year.
The influential German industry group BDI, in a draft China strategy paper seen by Reuters last month, called on firms to consider reducing dependence on the Chinese market despite its outsized importance for many big German companies.
According to the prosecutors' office, the employee gained access to large amounts of sensitive data as he moved up Lanxess's corporate ladder, and not by deploying sophisticated technology.
In a senior technical role at Lanxess since February 2010, he sent Chinese-language emails in 2011 and 2013 to an external associate identified as ""Mr U"", attaching information on a Lanxess-designed reactor and detailed instructions on how to operate it, court documents from the civil case show.
Within weeks, U replied by email with a proposal for a rival production site in China.
In 2016, the employee co-founded unspecified legal entities to produce and export the copied product from China and the business advertised its new capabilities online and in a press release, according to the documents.
The copycat company also touted itself as a future supplier to Lanxess's customers at trade fairs, the prosecutors' office said.
The defendants are not held on remand because personal circumstances suggest a low risk of absconding, it added.
A Cologne criminal court has yet to decide if and when the case will begin. According to the prosecutor's office, the designated court chosen by prosecutors implies a non-suspended prison sentence of up to four years. 

Cross-border theft of confidential business information carries a prison sentence of up to five years in Germany.

1139,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 05:03AM ET</span>",North Korean defectors see uncertain future in Korean reconciliation,"By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - Thae Yong Ho, one of the highest profile North Koreans to defect in recent years, had hoped to visit New York last month to speak on a United Nations panel, meet U.S. envoys, and discuss human rights in the reclusive Asian nation.
Only a year ago, Thae testified before a congressional committee, while other defectors met U.S. President Donald Trump, who highlighted several of their stories in his state of the union speech in January.
This time, however, Thae said the Americans told him they would not provide him with the security protection he was provided in the past, prompting him to cancel the trip.
""I just wanted to talk about the human rights issues, which are being neglected in the face of North Korea's charm offensive, and that's all I can do,"" Thae told Reuters.
Human rights have been almost completely absent from this year's flurry of diplomatic negotiations between North Korea's Kim Jong Un and leaders in South Korea and the United States.
As living examples of some of North Korea's worst abuses, defectors have long been the public face of campaigns to pressure Pyongyang to change its ways. 
But amid international efforts to reduce military tensions and improve ties with North Korea, many of the 32,000 North Korean refugees in South Korea say they feel like political pawns suddenly discarded.
'HUMAN SCUM'
Thae was North Korea's deputy envoy to the United Kingdom and, after his high-profile defection in 2016, South Korea's intelligence agency gave him a job at its affiliated think tank.
But as Seoul pushed for a thaw in ties with the North, Thae left the think tank in May, saying he did not want to be a ""burden"".
Soon after, Thae criticized Kim Jong Un during a press conference at the National Assembly, prompting Pyongyang to cancel high-level talks and blast the South for allowing ""human scum"" to speak.
One activist involved in planning Thae's aborted New York trip said it was a political decision. 
""If Thae goes there, Kim's image would surely get tarnished, and that will most likely come back to Trump who said he trusts Kim.""
The U.S. State Department did not respond to Reuters' request for comment, but officials have previously said they remain committed to human rights as an issue with North Korea.
Other defectors say they have also experienced a drop in support as South Korea and the United States seek to improve ties and officially end the 1950-53 Korean War. 
The South Korean government has cracked down on defector groups who use balloons to send contraband and anti-Kim leaflets into North Korea.
One veteran journalist at the Chosun Ilbo, a major South Korean newspaper, was last month denied access by the South Korean government to cover a round of negotiations with North Korea because he was a defector.
An official at the newspaper referred to an editorial saying the ban on the journalist was part of the government's censorship and maltreatment of defectors for the sake of the inter-Korean thaw.
The Unification Ministry said the ban was ""inevitable"" to ensure smooth talks, and it would make efforts to create conditions for defectors to resettle better. Minister Cho Myoung-gyon has said he would make the same decision if the situation recurs. 
And Choi Sung-guk, a defector who now draws cartoons about the life in North Korea, said he was asked to leave a radio show at TBS, a Seoul City-owned network supportive of the Moon administration, less than five minutes after criticizing Kim.
""They asked how I felt about Kim coming to the South, and I said we should not be deceived by him because I don't think he has changed,"" Choi said.
""But then my air-time was suddenly cut to one first sentence from what would have been a regular one hour otherwise.""
An official at TBS said Cho was not replaced because of his remarks but the network's decision to air ""better content"".
UNCERTAIN FUTURE
Under Kim, North Korea has been accused of widespread human rights abuses, including public executions, torture and prison camps where the United Nations estimate up to 120,000 people are held. Defectors risked their lives to cross the border in a journey that may entail persecution and slave labor, if caught and repatriated. 
Pyongyang rejects those allegations. 
""The Moon administration is even, unfortunately, cutting support for these marginalized groups and even trying to censor their voices,"" said Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer at the New York-based Human Rights Foundation, who met dozens of defectors during a visit to Seoul last month. 
Controversy over the fate of 12 North Korean waitresses, several of whom say they were tricked by South Korean intelligence into defecting and now want to return home, has made some in the refugee community concerned about being forced to return to North Korea.
Seoul's Unification Ministry has said the defection was voluntary, but said later it would consider ""various aspects"" of their defection, when asked if it would return the waitresses to North Korea if they wanted to. 
South Koreans, including defectors, must seek government approval to visit the North. Some defectors have sneaked in via China and appeared on North Korean TV to criticize the South. 
Another defector, Heo Seong-il, sought asylum in the United States in August, after facing years of what he says was harassment by the South Korean government, including a three-year jail term on espionage charges he says were false.
There was no immediate comment from the National Intelligence Service. 
Heo hoped for a better life after Moon was sworn in, only to realize things could get worse for defectors as the president pushed for peace with the North.
""When I was in the North, the South was my emotional support, and I didn't know it is a country where the government... can completely ignore a citizen's life,"" Heo, 36, told Reuters from the United States.
""I would rather live like a hobo here. I don't see a future in South Korea.""

The speaker of parliament, Baleka Mbete, received a letter from Gigaba informing her of his resignation, parliament said in a statement without providing further detail.
Last month, South Africa's anti-graft watchdog said Gigaba should be disciplined for lying about the wealthy Oppenheimer family's attempt to open the private immigration facility.

COX'S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Hundreds of Rohingya Muslim refugees in Bangladesh protested on Thursday against any attempt to send them back to Myanmar after sources in Bangladesh said the launch of a repatriation plan had been postponed.
Bangladesh had begun preparations to repatriate an initial batch of Rohingya Muslims to Myanmar on Thursday, in line with a plan agreed with Myanmar in October.
But there have been extensive doubts about the plan and it has been opposed by the U.N. refugee agency and aid groups, who fear for the safety of the Rohingya in Myanmar, and by many Rohingya in camps in Bangladesh. 
""No, no, we won't go,"" hundreds of Rohingya protesters chanted in the Unchiprang camp in southeast Bangladesh, near the Myanmar border.
Some protesters also waved placards that said ""We want justice,"" and ""We will never return to Myanmar without our citizenship"".
More than 700,000 Rohingya fled a sweeping army crackdown in Myanmar's Rakhine state last year, according to U.N. agencies, launched in response to Rohingya insurgent attacks on the security forces.
The Rohingya refugees say soldiers and Buddhist civilians massacred families, burned hundreds of villages and carried out gang rapes. U.N-mandated investigators have accused the Myanmar army of ""genocidal intent"" and ethnic cleansing.
Myanmar denies almost all of the accusations, saying its security forces have been engaged in a counter-insurgency operation against ""terrorists"".
Earlier, three sources directly briefed on the issue, said repatriation would not begin on Thursday as none of those selected to go back had agreed to.
""Nobody wants to go back,"" said one of the sources.
The repatriation of a first group of 2,200 refugees was to begin on Thursday, and officials in Myanmar had said they were ready to receive the returnees.
But Bangladesh has vowed not to force anyone to return and it has asked the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to make sure those short-listed to return really want to go back.
The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, said Bangladeshi officials were due to meet Myanmar counterparts at a border crossing to inform them that no one had agreed to return.
The Bangladesh government declined to comment. 
Unverified images on social media showed officials on the Myanmar side of the border waiting at a reception center.
U.N. rights boss Michelle Bachelet called on Bangladesh on Tuesday to halt the repatriation plan, warning that lives would be put at ""serious risk"".
The U.N. human rights office continued to receive reports of ongoing violations committed against Rohingya in Myanmar - including alleged killings, disappearances and arbitrary arrests, Bachelet said.

Myanmar does not consider the Rohingya a native ethnic group and most are stateless. Many in the Buddhist-majority country call the Rohingya ""Bengalis"", suggesting they belong in Bangladesh.

1143,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 03:53AM ET</span>","Exclusive: In rare coordinated move, Western envoys seek meeting on Xinjiang concerns","By Philip Wen, Michael Martina and Ben Blanchard
BEIJING (Reuters) - A group of 15 Western ambassadors in Beijing, spearheaded by Canada, are seeking a meeting with the top official in China's restive, heavily Muslim Xinjiang region for an explanation of alleged rights abuses against ethnic Uighurs.
The envoys are making their request in a letter to Chen Quanguo, Xinjiang's Communist Party boss, according to a copy of a draft letter seen by Reuters.
The move represents unusually broad, coordinated action by a group of countries over a human rights issue in China, and illustrates the mounting backlash Beijing is facing over its crackdown in the western region. 
Beijing has faced an outcry from activists, academics, foreign governments and U.N. rights experts over mass detentions and strict surveillance of the mostly Muslim Uighur minority and other Muslim groups who call Xinjiang home.
In August, a United Nations human rights panel said it had received many credible reports that a million or more Uighurs in China are being held in what resembles a ""massive internment camp that is shrouded in secrecy"".
China says it is not enforcing arbitrary detention and political re-education, but rather some citizens guilty of minor offences were being sent to vocational centers to provide employment opportunities.
Beijing bristles at criticism of its human rights situation, espousing a policy of non-interference in the affairs of other countries. China's top diplomat said on Tuesday the world should ignore ""gossip"" about Xinjiang and trust authorities there.
It was not clear if the letter had been sent yet or if it contents could be revised. One diplomatic source said it was being passed around for more countries to potentially sign.
Several other diplomats familiar with the letter would only confirm its existence and refused to discuss it further, citing its sensitivity. All of the diplomats declined to be identified.
Many foreign governments have refrained from speaking out over the Xinjiang situation, with diplomats saying countries are fearful of angering China, an increasingly weighty diplomatic player thanks to its economic heft and initiatives such as the Belt and Road infrastructure program. 
'WE ARE DEEPLY TROUBLED'
In the draft letter addressed directly to Chen, who outranks the region's ethnic Uighur governor Shohrat Zakir, the ambassadors said they were highly concerned by the U.N. findings on Xinjiang.
""We are deeply troubled by reports of the treatment of ethnic minorities, in particular individuals of Uyghur ethnicity, in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region,"" the draft reads, using an alternate spelling for Uighur.
""In order to better understand the situation, we request a meeting with you at your earliest convenience to discuss these concerns.""
The letter is copied to China's Foreign Ministry, the Ministry of Public Security and the Communist Party's international department.
It is not possible to directly contact any senior Chinese leader for comment.
The Xinjiang government, Ministry of Public Security, the party's international department and party's spokesman's office did not respond to requests for comment.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said she had not seen the letter, and that ambassadors were welcome to Xinjiang but if ""they want to go with the intention of pressuring the Xinjiang government, then this is definitely problematic"".
""As ambassadors, their role should firstly be to positively promote the mutual understanding, trust and cooperation between the country where they are stationed and the one they are sent from, and not to gossip, making powerless demands of the country they are stationed in and doing things that interfere in that country's internal affairs,"" Hua told a daily news briefing.
""We welcome well-intentioned attempts to understand the situation. Xinjiang is an open region. But we will firmly oppose ill-intentioned and biased attempts to interfere in the affairs of our local governments, or rashly criticize China over its internal affairs,"" she added.
China has said Xinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists who plot attacks and stir up tensions with the ethnic Han Chinese majority.
The letter carries the names of 15 Western ambassadors, including the Canadian, British, French, Swiss, European Union, German, Dutch and Australian envoys. The other countries' ambassadors names in the letter are Ireland, Sweden, Belgium, Norway, Estonia, Finland and Denmark. 
Four diplomats familiar with the letter and its contents said Canada had taken the lead in its drafting.
Canada's Foreign Ministry, in a statement sent to Reuters, did not comment directly on the letter but expressed deep concern over the reports of detention and mass surveillance of Uighurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang.
""The Minister of Foreign Affairs raised the situation faced by the Uyghurs directly with China's Foreign Minister at the UN General Assembly. Canada regularly raises concerns about Xinjiang with Chinese authorities both publicly and privately, bilaterally and multilaterally, and will continue to do so.""  
The EU, British, German, Swedish, Swiss, Belgian, Dutch, Finnish and Norwegian embassies declined to comment on the letter.
The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said the government was concerned about the situation in Xinjiang and officials had conveyed these concerns to China on a number of occasions.
The Irish, Danish, French and Estonian embassies did not respond to requests for comment.
The United States is not represented on the letter, although non-U.S. diplomats say the country has been deeply involved in advocacy on the Xinjiang issue.
""We remain alarmed that since April 2017 the Chinese government has detained an estimated 800,000 to possibly more than 2 million Uighurs, Kazaks and other Muslims in internment camps for political re-education,"" a U.S. embassy spokesman said, responding to a question regarding the letter. 
""The United States will continue to call on China to end these counterproductive policies and free all those arbitrarily detained. We are committed to promoting accountability for those who commit human rights violations and abuses, including by considering targeted measures against Xinjiang officials."" 

The United States has said it is considering sanctions against Chen, other officials and Chinese companies linked to allegations of rights abuses in Xinjiang.

1144,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 03:07AM ET</span>",Pence says Trump to meet North Korea's Kim in 2019; won't allow broken promises,"By John Geddie
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said on Thursday President Donald Trump plans to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the new year but won't repeat past mistakes of allowing promises to be broken on pledges to end arms programs. 
The United States and North Korea have been discussing a second meeting between their leaders to follow up the Singapore summit in June and lay the groundwork for ending a nuclear stand-off between the old foes.
""The plans are ongoing. We believe that the summit will likely occur after the 1st of the year but the when and the where of that is still being worked out,"" Pence told reporters after meeting South Korean President Moon Jae-in.
""We don't want to repeat the mistakes that prior administrations, frankly in both political parties, have made over the last several decades where promises are made, sanctions are lifted, economic support comes and then promises are broken.""
Pence and Moon were meeting on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific summit hosted by Singapore. 
A U.S. think tank said on Monday it had identified at least 13 of an estimated 20 active, undeclared missile bases inside North Korea, underscoring the challenge for American negotiators hoping to persuade Kim to give up his weapons programs.
North Korea had entered into agreements with regional powers in 1994 and in 2005 to dismantle its nuclear program in return for economic benefits and diplomatic rewards, but those deals broke down after Pyongyang clandestinely continued to pursue building weapons of mass destruction.
With scant sign of progress on negotiations since the June summit and recent high-level meetings canceled, Trump said last week he's now in ""no rush"" but still wants to meet with Kim for a second time.
U.S. officials have said sanctions forced North Korea to the negotiating table and vowed to keep pressure until complete denuclearization. But North Korea has credited its nuclear and missile breakthroughs for providing it the standing to meet the world's biggest powers.
Pence said Moon agreed to work closely with the United States toward the second U.S.-North Korea summit, as Washington maintains the ""maximum pressure"" campaign by keeping the sanctions against Pyongyang in place.
Asked if China, which has been the North's main economic benefactor, was doing enough to maintain sanctions pressure, Pence said Beijing has done more than they have ever done before and Trump was grateful for that.
A U.S. congressional commission said on Wednesday that China appears to have relaxed enforcement of sanctions on North Korea as Pyongyang began to engage with the United States this year.
Trump is expected to speak more about enforcing sanctions when he meets Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit late this month and the unique role that China can play in ensuring the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, Pence said. 
North Korea has not tested a nuclear device or ballistic missile since last year, and has said it has shuttered its main nuclear test site with plans to dismantle several more facilities.

But it has warned it could restart its nuclear program if the United States does not drop the sanctions regime.

Najib and his wife, who has faced criticism for her extravagant lifestyle, are at the center of a wide-ranging graft investigation launched by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who was returned to power by a stunning election victory in May. 
Prosecutors who charged Rosmah with two counts of corruption said the payments concerned a 1.25-billion-ringgit ($298-million) solar project in schools in Malaysia's eastern state of Sarawak, on the island of Borneo.
She pleaded not guilty to both the charges. 
Prosecutors said Rosmah sought a bribe of 187.5 million ringgit ($45 million) in 2016 from an executive of Jepak Holdings Sdn Bhd, and received a bribe of 1.5 million ringgit ($358,000) the following year from the official.
A spokeswoman for Jepak Holdings declined to comment to Reuters.
Since his election defeat, Najib has been charged with 38 counts of graft, mostly over a multi-billion-dollar corruption scandal at state fund 1Malaysian Development Berhad (1MDB). Rosmah was last month charged with 17 money laundering offences. 

Najib and Rosmah have pleaded not guilty to all charges.

1146,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 02:36AM ET</span>",Sri Lanka grinds to political halt amid parliamentary chaos,"By Shihar Aneez
COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka appeared to have ground to a political halt on Thursday, with the speaker of parliament saying there was no functioning prime minister or cabinet after a no-confidence vote the previous day.
His comments came after weeks of political turmoil in the island, off the southeast coast of India, culminating in noisy chaos on the floor of parliament on Thursday.
Parliament passed the no-confidence motion against recently appointed Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and his government with the backing of 122 of the 225 lawmakers in a voice vote, followed by a signed document.
But President Maithripala Sirisena, in a letter to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, said he could not accept the no-confidence vote as it appeared to have ignored the constitution, parliamentary procedure and tradition. 
""We expect the speaker to be an independent speaker and not a close friend of your party or the West,"" Rajapaksa told parliament. ""We want a general election.""
He also alleged the previous government led by ousted Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was corrupt.
""Since the no-confidence vote was passed yesterday, according to the constitution, the cabinet of ministers has been dissolved and no new prime minister or ministers appointed, today nobody will be accepted as prime minister or any other ministers,"" Jayasuriya told parliament.
In a letter to Sirisena, the speaker justified the vote of no-confidence, saying he had been forced to hold a voice vote after his pleas for a peaceful vote were ignored. 
Sirisena, who triggered the crisis by firing Wickremesinghe and naming Rajapaksa to the job late last month, dissolved parliament last week and ordered elections to break the deadlock.
But the Supreme Court ordered a suspension of that decree on Tuesday until it had heard petitions challenging the move as unconstitutional.
Soon after his speech, Rajapaksa's supporters poured on to the floor of parliament and disrupted proceedings. 
Then MPs from both sides gathered close to the Speaker's chair, with a lot of shouting and hooting.
The turmoil lasted almost 20 minutes after which Jayasuriya, failing to bring the house to order, left parliament without making any statement. 
After a meeting with party leaders, Jayasuriya agreed to convene the next parliament session on Wednesday, media reported. However, Wickremesinghe loyalists said there was no such agreement. 
Mahinda Samarasinghe, a Rajapaksa supporter, criticized the Jayasuriya for inviting foreign envoys to witness the proceedings, saying he was trying to destroy the perception of parliament.
Security was beefed up around the parliament and 32 ministries in capital Colombo, police said, a day after Rajapaksa and his cabinet were voted out.

Rajapaksa, under whose rule Sri Lanka achieved its 2009 victory in a decades-long conflict against rebels from the Tamil minority, is seen as a hero by many among Sri Lanka’s Buddhist majority. He has been accused by diplomats of human rights abuses during the war, which he denies.

1147,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 02:25AM ET</span>",Hong Kong freedoms under scrutiny as 'Occupy' democracy leaders face trial,"By James Pomfret
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Nine leaders of Hong Kong's 2014 civil disobedience ""Occupy Central"" movement go on trial on Monday at a time when the Chinese-ruled financial hub's civil liberties are coming under increasing strain.
The nine leaders include law professor Benny Tai, 54, sociologist Chan Kin-man, 59, and Reverend Chu Yiu-ming, 74, who face three charges related to public nuisance, including conspiracy and incitement, during street protests which brought much of the former British colony's Central business district to a halt.
This case could be the most consequential against the pro-democracy movement, with repercussions for hundreds of other protesters who were arrested in 2014 and are not sure if they will face trial. The nine defendants, who have all pleaded not guilty, face a maximum seven years in jail on each charge. 
""We will be given an opportunity to retell the story (of the Occupy movement), hoping that people will see the real spirit and relate it to what's really happening now, and think what they can do,"" said Tai, a professor at the University of Hong Kong.
""We want to reboot the spirit of the people.""
Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" formula, with the guarantee of a high degree of autonomy and freedoms denied citizens in mainland China, including freedom of speech and the right to protest.
Critics say, however, that the guarantee is ringing increasingly hollow, with perceived meddling by Communist Party rulers in the territory's affairs.
The 2014 ""Umbrella Movement"" blocked major roads for 79 days in a push for full democracy, presenting Beijing with one of its biggest political challenges in decades.
The protest tents were eventually cleared away by police with no democratic concessions.
Since then, authorities have pursued more than 40 criminal cases against more than 100 protesters, including two dozen or so pro-democracy leaders. Critics say these moves have scuppered the momentum of Hong Kong's youth-driven democracy movement, and substantially raised the stakes for future protests.
Last year, Hong Kong's highest court freed three younger protest leaders, Joshua Wong, Nathan Law and Alex Chow, reversing a decision by a lower court to jail them for unlawful assembly.
""NO POLITICAL INFLUENCE"" 
For the trial beginning on Monday, the defendants said they had initially expected to face unauthorized assembly charges, but were charged with the graver offences of conspiracy and public nuisance. One charge, ""incitement to incite public nuisance"", has rarely been used before.
Hong Kong's Solicitor General, Wesley Wong, said in a statement in July that the case was so large in terms of evidence and people involved that ""substantial"" time was needed to prepare for it.
He also said prosecutors would not be influenced by ""political"" considerations.
Authorities have banned a political party advocating Hong Kong independence, barred democracy activists from contesting local elections and disqualified six opposition lawmakers from the legislature.
Last week, a senior Financial Times journalist, Victor Mallet, was barred from the city after he helped host an independence activist at the Foreign Correspondents' Club, in what critics said was an attack on freedom of speech.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has repeatedly stressed Hong Kong respects media and other freedoms, but has so far refused to give an explanation for Mallet's de facto expulsion.
""The crackdown by the regime is more than I expected in that it's so brazen, so shameless,"" said Chan, who will take early retirement from the Chinese University of Hong Kong to avoid the risk of being fired should he be jailed.
""It's a very frustrating, difficult moment for Hong Kong ... They (the Hong Kong government) want to become another Singapore,"" he added, referring to the city state's tight grip on civil society and political discourse.
Many of the moves were made after Chinese President Xi Jinping warned in a speech in July last year, marking the 20th anniversary of the handover, that any attempt to undermine China's sovereignty was a ""red line"" that wouldn't be tolerated.

Some senior Western diplomats have privately expressed concerns Hong Kong's liberal latitude will continue to shrink, despite objections from the international and business communities.

Pence did not mention China in his remarks at the opening of a summit with Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Singapore, but stressed that small countries as well as large ones should be allowed to prosper in the Indo-Pacific.
""Like you, we seek an Indo-Pacific in which all nations, large and small, can prosper and thrive – secure in our sovereignty, confident in our values, and growing stronger together,"" he said. ""We all agree that empire and aggression have no place in the Indo-Pacific.""
He said Washington had taken action to promote this vision, including steps to spur private investment in infrastructure and a pursuit of trade that is ""free, fair, and reciprocal"".
The vice president also highlighted the United States' ""pressure campaign"" on North Korea, its ""commitment to uphold the freedom of the seas and skies"" and determination to ensure that Southeast Asian nations are secure in their sovereign borders, on land, and at sea in the digital world.
Pence's comments follow a major speech in October in which he flagged a tougher approach by Washington toward Beijing, accusing China of ""malign"" efforts to undermine U.S. President Donald Trump and reckless military actions in the South China Sea.
The United States has conducted a series of ""freedom of navigation"" exercises in the contested South China Sea, angering Beijing, which says the moves threaten its sovereignty.
China's claims in the South China Sea, through which some $3 trillion of shipborne trade passes each year, are contested by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. 
Beijing and Washington are locked in a trade war in which they have imposed increasingly severe rounds of tariffs on each other's imports.

F.E. WARREN AIR FORCE BASE, Wyo. (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Wednesday formally returned church bells to the Philippines that were taken as war trophies over a century ago following gruesome clashes, seeking to close a contentious chapter in the two allies' shared history.
The decision to return the ""Bells of Balangiga"" to the Philippines ends a decades-long quest by Manila, including by President Rodrigo Duterte, and is expected to bolster U.S.-Philippines' relations.
But it has upset some U.S. veterans and Wyoming's delegation to the U.S. Congress, which uniformly opposed returning bells that were a memorial to the 45 U.S. soldiers who were killed during a surprise attack on Sept. 28, 1901, in the central town of Balangiga.
Two of the three bells have been on display at F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming. The third bell is at a U.S. Army museum in South Korea. 
Mattis, speaking at a ceremony at the air force base attended by the Philippines ambassador to the United States, said the Philippines has proven itself as a great U.S. ally in conflicts over the century since that clash. He said the sacrifices of U.S. forces would not be forgotten.
""To those who fear we lose something by returning these bells, please hear me when I say: Bells mark time, but courage is timeless,"" Mattis said. ""It does not fade in history's dimly lit corridors.""
In Manila, the Philippines' foreign affairs department cheered the move.
""Today is a time of solemn remembrance as we pay tribute to all those who gave up their lives during the Filipino-American War,"" it said.
Wyoming's Congressional delegation, which did not attend the ceremony, issued a terse statement.
""We continue to oppose any efforts by the Administration to move the Bells to the Philippines without the support of Wyoming’s veterans community,"" Senators Mike Enzi and John Barrasso and Representative Liz Cheney told Reuters in a joint statement.
All three bells will be restored and handed over to the Philippines as early as December, said Joe Felter, deputy assistant secretary of defense for South and Southeast Asia.
The 1901 attack in Balangiga, on the Filipino island of Samar, was seen as perhaps the worst routing of U.S. soldiers since the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876, also known as Custer's Last Stand.
According to historians, one or more of the church bells were rung to signal the attack in Balangiga.
U.S. forces took the bells after a brutal counterattack that killed anywhere from hundreds to thousands of people in the Philippines, historians say. One U.S. general was said to have directed his troops to ""make the interior of Samar a howling wilderness.""
Some Wyoming veterans, like Cheryl Shannon at Veterans of Foreign Wars, said they were fine with the decision to return the bells.
""We're tired of it always being an issue,"" said Shannon, an Iraq war veteran.
But Hank Miller, a veteran with the VFW who wanted to keep the bells in Wyoming, said broader support for his position had faded as it became clear Washington would return the bells. 

""I was advised to 'stop fighting a losing battle' and 'stop beating a dead horse' as the bells were going back,"" Miller told Reuters.

1151,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 11:56PM ET</span>","At least 56 killed, 130 missing in California's deadliest wildfire","By Terray Sylvester
PARADISE, Calif. (Reuters) - National Guard troops joined the grim search on Wednesday for more victims in the ruins of an incinerated northern California town while the death toll climbed to 56 in the most deadly and destructive wildfire in the state's history.
The latest fatality count was announced as authorities released a revised list of 130 people reported missing by loved ones after flames largely obliterated the Sierra foothills town of Paradise, about 175 miles (280 km) north of San Francisco, last Thursday.
The majority on the list were over the age of 65. Nearly 230 people were initially reported as missing in the killer blaze, dubbed the Camp Fire. Most of those who remain unaccounted for are from Paradise, once home to 27,000 people.
More than 8,900 homes and other buildings burned to the ground in and around Paradise, and an estimated 50,000 people remained under evacuation orders in the area. 
Adding to the misery of some survivors was an outbreak of norovirus, a highly contagious gastrointestinal illness, at a shelter housing about 200 evacuees in the nearby city of Chico.
Public health agency spokeswoman Lisa Almaguer said at least 20 people may have caught the virus.
The footprint of the six-day-old fire grew to 135,000 acres (55,000 hectares) as of Wednesday, even as diminished winds and rising humidity helped firefighters shore up containment lines around more than a third of the perimeter.
Still, the ghostly expanse of empty lots covered in ash and strewn with twisted wreckage and debris made a strong impression on Governor Jerry Brown, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and other officials who toured the devastation on Wednesday.
""This is one of the worst disasters I've seen in my career, hands down,"" Brock Long, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, told reporters in Chico.
""It looks like a war zone. It is a war zone,"" Brown said.
NO FINGER POINTING 
After visiting some of California's earlier wildfire zones in August, Zinke blamed ""gross mismanagement of forests"" because of timber harvest restrictions that he said were supported by ""environmental terrorist groups.""
But pressed by reporters on Wednesday, Zinke demurred. ""Now is really not the time to point fingers,"" he said. ""It is a time for America to stand together."" 
The blaze, fueled by thick, drought-desiccated scrub, has capped two back-to-back catastrophic wildfire seasons in California that scientists largely attribute to prolonged drought they say is symptomatic of climate change.
Lawyers for some of the victims claimed in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday that lax equipment maintenance by an electric utility was the proximate cause of the fire, which officially remains under investigation.
The Butte County disaster coincided with a flurry of blazes in Southern (NYSE:SO) California, most notably the Woolsey Fire, which has killed at least two people, destroyed more than 500 structures and displaced about 200,000 people in the mountains and foothills near the Malibu coast west of Los Angeles.
On Wednesday, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said the body of a possible third victim was found there in a burned-out dwelling. Cal Fire officials said that blaze was 52 percent contained as of Wednesday night.
In Butte County, the search for more human remains kicked into high gear as a National Guard contingent of 50 military police officers joined dozens of search-and-recovery workers and at least 22 cadaver dogs, Sheriff Kory Honea said.
The remains of eight more fire victims were found on Wednesday, raising the official number of fatalities to 56 - far exceeding the previous record from a single wildfire in California history - 29 people killed by the Griffith Park fire in Los Angeles in 1933.
The Camp Fire also stands as one of the deadliest U.S. wildfires since the turn of the last century. More than 80 people perished in the Big Burn firestorm that swept the Northern Rockies in August of 1910.
TRACKING THE MISSING
Butte County Sheriff's spokeswoman Megan McMann said the list of 130 missing would fluctuate from day to day as more names are added and others are removed, either because they turn up safe or end up identified among the dead.
Sheriff Honea invited relatives of the missing to provide DNA samples to compare against samples taken from newly recovered remains in hopes of speeding up identification of the dead. But he acknowledged it was possible some of the missing might never be found.
Authorities attributed the magnitude of casualties to the staggering speed with which the fire struck Paradise. Wind-driven flames roared through town so swiftly that residents were forced to flee for their lives. Some victims were found in or around the burned-out wreckage of their vehicles.
Anna Dise, a resident of Butte Creek Canyon west of Paradise, told KRCR TV her father, Gordon Dise, 66, died when he ran back inside to gather belongings and their house collapsed on him. 
Dise said she could not flee in her car because the tires had melted. To survive, she hid overnight in a neighbor's pond with her dogs.
""It was so fast,"" Dise recounted of the fire. ""I didn't expect it to move so fast.""

TIJUANA, Mexico (Reuters) - The arrival in the Mexican border city of Tijuana of the first few hundred travelers from migrant caravans is stretching to the limit shelters already overflowing with people, and sparking signs of friction among the population.
Lugging heavy bundles and small children, an unprecedented caravan of thousands of mostly Honduran migrants set off for the United States in mid-October, many of them fleeing violence and poverty at home. 
Two other copycat groups, mostly made up of El Salvadorans, followed behind.
U.S. President Donald Trump has declared the caravans an ""invasion,"" and threatened to close down the Mexico-U.S. border to keep them out, ordering some 7,000 troops to reinforce the frontier, including in Tijuana, with barbed wire.
But that has not stopped people trying to reach the border, including those from the caravans, others traveling from Central America independently, and Mexicans fleeing violence in cartel-plagued states.
Jose Maria Garcia, director of the Juventud 2000 migrant shelter, said he had been warning authorities since the Honduran caravan set out that migrant refuges were already operating at capacity in the border cities of Tijuana and Mexicali.
""People are still arriving, but we're not prepared to receive them,"" Garcia told Reuters. He said he believes the incoming caravans would be the largest number of migrants to arrive in the city in such a short time in recent memory.
The buildup in Tijuana will be a test of tougher asylum rules introduced by Trump, which some experts believe will push more people to try to cross illegally. Few of the 20 migrants interviewed by Reuters were aware of the new rules.
Tijuana has a history of absorbing visitors, including Chinese immigrants in the 19th century, a large American population and Haitians who settled in the city south of San Diego in 2016 after failing to cross the U.S. border.
Some 810 people who broke away from the first caravan have reached Tijuana since Monday, said Mario Osuna, secretary of social development in Tijuana's municipal government.
Osuna said that an additional 1,260 migrants are expected in coming days as the main body of the caravans arrive.
""It's our concern ... to receive the support from the central government (so) we can receive the resources and face this situation,"" said Osuna, adding they were also coordinating with the incoming government of President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.
Almost 3,000 people - many of them Mexicans - are waiting in migrant shelters to request asylum alongside hundreds of Central Americans, said Cesar Palencia, head of the Tijuana city government's migrant outreach team. 
U.S. border officials process about 75 to 100 asylum claims a day, so it could be a month before new arrivals are seen, said Pedro Rios, of the American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker group that works with migrants.
Of the 14 migrant shelters on the 2,000-mile (3,200 km) border, 10 are totally overcrowded, Palencia said. Dozens of arrivals from the caravan camped on the beach on Tuesday night.
""People have received us kindly, but they say there's not enough room for everyone, so we decided to spend the night on the beach,"" said a Honduran woman in Tijuana as she washed her face in a public bathroom, asking to remain anonymous.
""It was a terrible night for me and my children.""
The bulk of the group that formed after the Honduran caravan began entering Mexico over three weeks ago is now moving up the Pacific northwest coast through the state of Sinaloa, made up of between 4,000 and 5,000 people, authorities say.
'NOTHING FOR US'
The Mexican government has urged the migrants to register for asylum in Mexico, or risk deportation. President-elect Lopez Obrador has vowed to provide jobs and visas to the Central Americans.
That message has not been popular with all Mexicans, many of whom fear for their own futures.
""We also need help,"" said Olga Cruz from the western state of Michoacan, who had come to Tijuana to seek asylum in the United States with her three children.
""Not a day goes by (in Michoacan) without somebody being killed, and I don't want my children growing up like this,"" she said. ""But if the government only focuses on helping (Central Americans) they leave nothing for us,"" she added.

On Monday, a group of about 80 mainly LGBT people who split from the migrant caravan moved into a building in a wealthy area of ​​Tijuana. Residents shouted at them to leave and demanded that authorities take steps to eject them.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama was set to win re-election on Thursday, with a provisional count showing his Fiji First party holding a comfortable lead, although some voting has been delayed due to bad weather in the South Pacific nation.
Bainimarama has held power in the island nation since 2006 when as military chief he led a bloodless coup. In 2014, he resigned from the military and became prime minister in a landslide victory at the first poll since his coup.
Results posted on the government's twitter account on Thursday morning showed Bainimarama's Fiji First party leading with nearly 52 percent of the 367,350 votes counted.
Over 500,000 Fijians were eligible to vote, according to the Fiji Elections Office (FEO) website. 
Bainimarama's main opponent is also a former coup leader and long-serving prime minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, who now leads the Social Democratic Liberal Party of Fiji (SODELPA). He was coming second, with 38 percent support.
Torrential rain and flooding on Wednesday forced voting in some centers to be rescheduled. Authorities said around 8,000 voters were affected.
A campaign blackout period was extended because of the delayed voting, but media were allowed to report the preliminary results, Media Industry Development Authority (MIDA) Chairperson Ashwin Raj said on Wednesday. 
Fiji was isolated diplomatically after the 2006 coup, but its return to democracy has seen it welcomed back into the international community, with Britain's Prince Harry and his wife, Megan, visiting in October. 
Jonathan Pryke of the Lowy Institute in Sydney said before the poll that the Bainimarama government had surpassed critics' expectations with the economy growing and standards of living rising steadily. 

Polling booths where voting was delayed have been rescheduled to the 17th of November, the Supervisor of Elections, Mohammed Saneem also announced on Thursday.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Attorney Michael Avenatti, who represents adult film star Stormy Daniels in her legal battles with U.S. President Donald Trump, was arrested in Los Angeles on Wednesday on suspicion of domestic violence, a police spokesman said.
Los Angeles Police Department spokesman Jeff Lee said no further details were immediately available, but he said Avenatti was released on bail after he was formally booked in the case.
""It will be presented to the district attorney's office just like any other case,"" Lee said. ""They'll take a look at it and see if there's enough evidence to proceed.""
The celebrity news website TMZ, which broke the news of Avenatti's arrest, reported that it stemmed from a physical confrontation between him and a woman at an apartment building Tuesday night in the Century City district of Los Angeles.
Avenatti, who has indicated that he might run for president in 2020 as a Democrat, denied wrongdoing in a statement issued through his law firm and in a statement to reporters outside the LAPD West Los Angeles police station following his release.
""I have never struck a woman. I never will strike a woman. I've been an advocate for women's rights my entire career,"" he said, adding that he would never ""disrespect"" his two daughters ""by touching a woman inappropriately or striking a woman.""
""I look forward to a full investigation at which point I am confident I will be fully exonerated,"" he added, without taking any questions.
In the statement from his law office, he said, ""I have never been physically abusive in my life, nor was I last night. Any accusations to the contrary are fabricated and meant to do harm to my reputation.""
Avenatti came to national prominence as the lawyer for Daniels, a porn actress whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, who sued Trump for defamation after he denied her assertion that she had a sexual encounter with him in 2006.
That lawsuit was dismissed by a federal judge last month. Daniels has filed a separate lawsuit over a $130,000 hush-money agreement stemming from the alleged encounter.

Avenatti's clients have included Julie Swetnick, who accused Brett Kavanaugh of aggressive sexual behavior before his confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The department did not say what the two would discuss, but last month when Pompeo met with the current Mexican foreign minister, Luis Videgaray, in Mexico City they discussed a caravan of Central American migrants moving toward the United States.
U.S. President Donald Trump has called the migrants' effort to seek asylum in the United States an ""invasion"" and has deployed the military to the border to reinforce security measures.
In the past few days up to 1,000 people from caravans of migrants have arrived in the Mexican border city of Tijuana, with a similar number expected to arrive in the next day or so.

Ebrard will take up his post when leftist President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is sworn on Dec. 1. Lopez Obrador has signaled he hopes to repair bilateral ties damaged by Trump's criticism of Mexico for failing to stop migration and his demands for a border wall paid for by Mexico.

The two carriers, the Japan-based USS Ronald Reagan and the USS John C Stennis deployed from the U.S. West coast, are carrying out air, surface and anti-submarine warfare operations, the U.S. Seventh Fleet said in a news release.
The U.S. Navy has conducted such operations before, including drills by three carriers last year as tensions with North Korea escalated. The latest, which coincides with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence's visit to the region, comes as denuclearization talks with North Korea show little sign of progress and amid a tit-for-tat trade spat with China.
""Bringing two carrier strike groups together provides unparalleled naval combat power,"" U.S. Seventh Fleet commander Vice Admiral Phil Sawyer said.
The USS Reagan also took part in the biggest war games ever staged in and around Japan this month, involving dozens of U.S. and Japanese ships, hundreds of aircraft and thousands of military personnel.

1158,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 06:40PM ET</span>",China appears to relax North Korea sanctions: report to U.S. Congress,"By David Brunnstrom
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. congressional commission said on Wednesday that China appears to have relaxed enforcement of sanctions on North Korea and called on the Treasury Department to provide a report on Chinese compliance within 180 days.
In its annual report, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission said the Treasury report should include a classified list of Chinese financial institutions, businesses, and officials involved in trading with North Korea that could be subject to future sanctions. 
The bipartisan commission said China had appeared to enforce sanctions on North Korea more thoroughly than in the past in 2017 and in early 2018.
But this effort appeared to have relaxed since a thaw in relations between China and North Korea as the long-time ally of Beijing began to engage with the United States this year.
""China appears to have eased off sanctions enforcement, despite its promises to keep sanctions intact until North Korea gets rid of its nuclear weapons,"" the report said.
""North Korean workers have returned to jobs in northeast China, economic activity and tourism have picked up in border towns, flights in both directions have resumed, and the two countries have conducted high-profile official exchanges to discuss economic development,"" it said.
It said China always left ""key lifelines"" in place for North Korea and there were ""holes"" in enforcement that included ""ship to ship"" transfers of goods.The report said the Treasury Department, in recommending Chinese sanctions targets, should also ""explain the potential broader impacts of sanctioning those entities.""
The United Nations Security Council has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for its weapons programs. The United States has imposed sanctions in the past on Chinese and other foreign firms for violating those steps.
China and Russia have said the Security Council should reward Pyongyang for ""positive developments"" after U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met in June and Kim pledged to work toward denuclearization. 
China's top diplomat and politburo member Yang Jiechi said after talks in Washington last week that China would ""continue to enforce strictly relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions.""  
Trump has suggested China may be exerting negative pressure on U.S. efforts to press North Korea to denuclearize in response to U.S. trade measures on Beijing.

The U.S. Treasury did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the commission report, but the State Department said it expected all U.N. states to implement sanctions resolutions until North Korea gave up its nuclear weapons.

1159,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 06:22PM ET</span>",U.S. Senate's Flake takes a stand on protecting Mueller probe,"By David Morgan and Richard Cowan
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A lone Republican lawmaker on Wednesday vowed to block judicial nominations in the U.S. Senate until Republican leader Mitch McConnell agrees to hold a vote on a measure to protect a probe into Russia's role in the 2016 presidential election.
Senator Jeff Flake made the threat after McConnell blocked Flake's measure from moving forward. The Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act would make it harder for President Donald Trump to undermine the investigation into Russian meddling and any coordination between Moscow and the Trump campaign.
Moscow denies interfering and Trump has repeatedly dismissed Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation as a political witch hunt.
""I will not vote to advance any of the 21 judicial nominees pending in the Judiciary Committee, or vote to confirm the 32 judges awaiting confirmation on the Senate floor until (the bill) is brought to the full Senate,"" Flake said in a floor speech after his effort to win consent for a vote failed. 
Flake, who is retiring from the Senate, used the same strategy earlier this year to obtain a Senate vote on an amendment to rein in Trump's power to impose tariffs on foreign goods.
His vote is especially crucial on the 21-member Senate Judiciary Committee, which Republicans control by only a single seat. But Flake could also make life difficult for McConnell on actions in the 100-seat Senate, which Republicans control by only a 51-49 seat margin through the end of the year. 
McConnell has maintained for months that there is no danger to Mueller's investigation.
""I don't think any legislation is necessary,"" he told reporters after winning his bid to remain Senate Republican leader.
""We know how the president feels about the ... investigation, but he's never said he wants to shut it down,"" McConnell said.
However, on Aug. 1, Trump appealed to then-U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions to end the investigation, sending the following message on Twitter: ""This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now.""
McConnell came to the Senate floor himself to prevent Flake's bill from moving forward. 
Flake and Democratic Senator Chris Coons, also part of the effort to obtain a vote to protect Mueller, said they would continue to seek legislative action and could push to have a measure included in a government spending bill later this year.
A week ago, Trump set off alarm bells among Democrats and some Republicans by forcing the resignation of Sessions and replacing him with Matthew Whitaker, a Trump loyalist who has criticized the Mueller probe as too far-reaching.
Critics of the Whitaker appointment say that, as acting attorney general, he could fire Mueller or undermine the Russian meddling investigation in some other way.
The bill backed by Flake and Coons would ensure that Mueller could be fired only for good cause and provide him with recourse to challenge any dismissal in federal court. It was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee in a 14-7 vote in April.
It is supported by the panel's chairman Chuck Grassley, as well as prominent Senator Lindsey Graham. Both are Republicans.
It is also backed by Democrats. ""We want to make sure that the acting attorney general does not interfere with the Mueller investigation, and we believe our Republican colleagues can join us,"" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters. 

Flake said there were enough votes to pass the bill. He said there would be repeated efforts to bring it to a vote despite McConnell.

1160,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 06:16PM ET</span>","In APEC host Papua New Guinea, China and the West grapple over strategic port","By Colin Packham and Philip Wen
SYDNEY/BEIJING (Reuters) - When Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Peter O'Neill flagged the possibility of China bankrolling a port development off his country's northern coast in June, the consternation in neighboring Australia set off a lightening-fast response. 
Despite a change in leadership in Australia's government in August, a rival offer was swiftly formulated, government and diplomatic sources told Reuters, amid concern the strategically-located Manus Island port could regularly host Chinese military vessels.
Canberra, a staunch Washington ally, said earlier this month it would fund the port development, part of what analysts see as a push to reassert its dominance in the South Pacific as Beijing seeks a more prominent role.
""The Manus Island port was a big concern for us,"" a senior U.S. diplomatic source told Reuters, on condition of anonymity. ""It was feasible Chinese military vessels could have used the port so we are very happy that Australia will fund the re-development."" 
Australia is preparing to make the verbal agreement formal at this week's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, held in PNG's capital, Port Moresby.
While conceived as a means to remove trade barriers in the Pacific, the hosting of this year's APEC has also seen PNG become a staging ground for regional influence where the U.S. and China lock in competing alliances. 
China has spent $1.3 billion on concessionary loans and gifts since 2011 to become the Pacific's second-largest donor after Australia, stoking concern in the West that several tiny Pacific nations could end up overburdened and in debt to Beijing.
China says it has no ulterior motive beyond assisting the development goals of Pacific Island nations and that Australia should see it as a partner, rather than rival, in the region.
On Friday, President Xi Jinping will showcase China's Belt and Road to Pacific leaders, several of whom are expected to sign up to the infrastructure initiative. 
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison last week characterized the Pacific as Australia's ""patch"" while offering the region up to A$3 billion ($2.18 billion) in cheap infrastructure loans and grants to counter China's rising influence in the region.
""There is an acceptance within Australia that it has taken its eye off the ball and that has prompted Australia's Pacific reset,"" said Nick Bisley, professor of international relations at Melbourne's La Trobe University.
NAUGHTY STEP 
This is the first time PNG, the poorest of the 21 countries in the economic bloc, is hosting the APEC summit. The country's overriding focus is for the event in Port Moresby to be a success, Western officials say, overcoming perceptions of inadequate infrastructure, high crime rates and a crumbling healthcare system.
Aware of the importance PNG's leadership has attached to the event, Australia and China have donated hundreds of millions of dollars to help stage the forum.
But Western efforts to leverage APEC have been a dealt a blow by lukewarm U.S. support, with President Donald Trump electing to skip the event. 
Attending in Trump's stead, Vice-President Mike Pence will not stay in Port Moresby, instead flying in and out daily from the northeastern Australian city of Cairns. 
""The U.S. are well and truly on the naughty step,"" a senior British diplomat told Reuters. ""Papua New Guinea believes the quality of the event is not what comes from it but rather who attends and the decisions by Trump not to attend and Pence to fly in and out only for APEC has upset PNG Prime Minister Peter O'Neill."" 
In contrast, Chinese President Xi Jinping will spend several days in Port Moresby and conduct an official bilateral visit. 
He will also host a closed forum with Pacific leaders, where he is expected to announce a big Chinese aid and investment package to the Pacific, tying it to his signature Belt and Road infrastructure initiative, Western diplomats said.
""The President asked the Vice President specifically to do this trip on his behalf because he believed that he would be the ideal messenger for the President on American policy for the region, the President's objectives in trade and investments, and strategically,"" a senior U.S. administration official told reporters in a briefing.
Asked whether Asian nations might view Trump's absence as a snub, Pence told reporters traveling with him to Asia: ""Not in the least,"" adding that Trump attended the ASEAN and APEC summits last year.
PLAYING CATCH-UP
Manus Island was a major U.S. naval base during the Second World War, playing a key role in Washington's Pacific strategy. More recently, the island has hosted one of Australia's two controversial offshore immigration detention centers. 
Analysts say a Chinese presence there could impact the West's ability to navigate the Pacific while offering Beijing close access to U.S. bases in Guam.
""Australia is concerned the Pacific could become the next South China Sea where Beijing militarizes the region,"" said La Trobe's Bisley.
The question is whether China has gained such a firm foothold it will prove difficult to shake, diplomats and officials told Reuters.
PNG has the largest debt to China in the South Pacific, at almost $590 million, representing about one-quarter of its total external debt.
""Chinese presence is seen everywhere. It has been achieved in large part through its investment into the country,"" said a senior French diplomat who declined to be named as he is not authorized to talk to the media. 
""With PNG's economy now in trouble, what China says, goes.""

Ambassador James Jeffrey, the U.S. special representative for Syria engagement, said the United States believes the way forward in Syria includes defeating Islamic State, reinvigorating the political process and winding down the long-running civil war.
Toward that end, he said, the United States hopes to see the formation of a committee before the end of the year to work on a new constitution for Syria as agreed by the leaders of Russia, Germany, France and Turkey during their meeting in Istanbul in October.
He said U.S. forces would remain in place after the coalition forces prevail over Islamic State military units to ensure the group does not ""regenerate itself.""
""The enduring defeat means not simply smashing the last of ISIS’ conventional military units holding terrain, but ensuring that ISIS doesn’t immediately come back in sleeper cells, come back as an insurgent movement,"" Jeffrey said, using an acronym for the group. 
Washington also wants the withdrawal of Iranian military forces from Syria once the underlying causes of the conflict have been resolved, he said, noting that Iran's continued military presence would represent a threat to U.S. partners in the region.
Jeffrey said the final ground combat is along the Euphrates River and is being led by Syrian Democratic Forces assisted by U.S. military personnel.
""The fight is continuing and we hope that it will be over in a few months and that will be the last of ISIS’ terrain that it holds in a quasi-conventional way,"" he said.
Jeffrey said convening a committee under U.N. auspices to begin work on a new Syrian constitution was a ""critical step"" toward advancing the political process. He said the United States would hold Russia to account to use its influence to bring the government of its ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, to the negotiating table.
""Our goal, which again was supported by Russia, France, Germany and Turkey and agreed in the Oct. 27 Istanbul communique, is to establish this constitutional committee by the end of the year,"" he said.
Jeffrey said getting Iranian forces out of Syria, where they back Assad's rule, was not a U.S. military goal but should be an outcome of the process to end the civil war and the only way to achieve lasting peace.
He said newly reinstated U.S. sanctions against Iran would encourage Tehran to scale back its presence in Syria.

1162,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 05:12PM ET</span>",Mattis defends Mexico border deployment in first troop visit,"By Phil Stewart
BASE CAMP DONNA, Texas (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis defended the deployment of thousands of troops to the border with Mexico as he traveled there on Wednesday, saying the mission was ""absolutely legal"" and justified, and that it was improving military readiness.
President Donald Trump's politically charged decision to send U.S. troops to the Mexico border came ahead of U.S. midterm congressional elections last week, as Trump sought to strengthen border security as part of a crackdown on illegal immigration.
Trump's supporters, including Republicans in Congress, have embraced the deployment.
But critics have assailed it as a political stunt to drive Republican voters to the polls. They have scoffed at Trump's comparison of caravans of Central American migrants, including women and children, to an ""invasion.""
Mattis, speaking to reporters traveling with him, rejected criticism and said the deployment was the right thing to do.
""It's very clear that support to border police or border patrol is necessary right now,"" Mattis said, noting that that was the assessment of the Department of Homeland Security. 
He added the deployment was deemed legal by Trump administration attorneys and was improving readiness by giving troops more experience in rapid deployment.
The visit took Mattis near the Texas town of Donna, where U.S. troops have set up a base camp near a border crossing point with Mexico. General Terrence O'Shaughnessy, the head of U.S. Northern Command, greeted him as he landed.
Mattis said U.S. soldiers were making rapid progress erecting barriers along the border and estimated the first, construction phase of the U.S. military effort could be completed within 10 days.
""I would anticipate with what we’ve been asked to do so far, probably within a week to 10 days, we’ll have done what’s needed,"" Mattis told the reporters. ""Of course, it will be a dynamic situation and there will be new requests coming in.""
Mattis said the troops were also rehearsing helicopter operations to help support U.S. border personnel, potentially flying them to new locations if the caravans of migrants shift direction.
The deployed U.S. troops are not expected to directly interact with migrants, most are unarmed, and they are only assigned tasks that support U.S. border personnel, including building temporary lodging.
In the past few days up to 1,000 migrants linked to the caravans have arrived in the Mexican border city of Tijuana, with a similar number expected to arrive in the next day or so. Thousands more could arrive in border towns over the coming days as the bulk of the caravans arrive.
""We didn't come here to steal or cause problems; it's a shame they think we are criminals,"" said Placido Cruz, a day laborer from Honduras, who arrived in Tijuana this week as part of a group that splintered from the caravan and went on ahead.
He said he was worried about the deployment of the military against migrants.
""They should leave that for war; we come in peace. Nobody should be harmed for wanting to protect their family.""
Standing alongside Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, Mattis told troops their job was to back up Nielsen’s agency, and to ignore the media. 
""You just concentrate on what your company commander, your battalion commander tells you,"" Mattis said.
""If you read all that stuff, you’ll go nuts ... You know what your mission is here. You’ve had to deploy on short notice to a nontraditional location and do your jobs. So you focus on doing that.""
SCRUTINY FROM CONGRESS
Trump's Democratic opponents have threatened to investigate the matter once they take control of the House of Representatives early next year after gaining a majority in the House in the midterm elections.
Rep. Bennie Thompson, the top Democrat on the House Committee on Homeland Security, told Reuters that Trump had used the military ""as a prop to stoke fear and score political points.""
""We will soon be finally able to conduct oversight of this gross abuse and the President’s many failed border security policies,"" said Thompson, who is expected to lead the committee when the Democrats take control of the House in January.
It is unclear how long the deployment will last. Mattis initially authorized it through mid-December but it could be extended.
Mattis estimated about 5,900 troops were participating in the border mission. The U.S. military has offered a breakdown accounting for 5,600 of them, estimating about 2,800 troops in Texas, 1,500 in Arizona and another 1,300 in California. 
Asked whether troops' families should expect their loved ones to remain deployed through Thanksgiving or even Christmas, Mattis declined to speculate, or to estimate costs of the deployment until he had better data.
Trump railed against illegal immigration to win the 2016 presidential election and has shown no signs of easing up on the issue in the wake of last week's vote.
Last week, he effectively suspended the granting of asylum to migrants who cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally, seeking fresh ways to block thousands of Central Americans traveling in caravans from entering the United States.
Mattis compared the mission to past deployments, largely comprised of U.S. National Guard, during Democratic and Republican administrations.

""We determined that the mission was absolutely legal and this was also reviewed by Department of Justice lawyers. It’s obviously a moral and ethical mission to support our border patrolmen,"" Mattis said.

1163,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 04:50PM ET</span>",Brazil's Bolsonaro names Trump fan top diplomat as Cuba relations sour,"By Anthony Boadle
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's far-right President-elect Jair Bolsonaro chose an admirer of U.S. President Donald Trump's conservative nationalism as his top diplomat on Wednesday, while escalating tensions with communist Cuba over a medical aid program.
Bolsonaro's pick of career diplomat Ernesto Araujo, 51, underscored Brazil's sharp turn to the right and the reversal of nearly a decade and a half of diplomacy under leftist Workers Party governments that focused on alliances with South American allies and ideological partners - including Cuba.
""Brazil's foreign policy should be part of this moment of regeneration that Brazil is living right now,"" Bolsonaro, a longstanding Trump admirer, wrote on Twitter.
In another sign of Brazil's new foreign policy direction under Bolsonaro, the former army captain announced he would grant asylum to any Cuban national who asks for it. That came after Cuba said it would pull thousands of its doctors from Brazil after Bolsonaro questioned their training and demanded changes to their contracts. 
Araujo, a career diplomat, is currently head of the foreign ministry's United States and Canada department. Last year, he raised eyebrows in the foreign ministry with an article that stated Brazil has a chance to recover its ""Western soul"" by embracing Trump's brand of nationalism and pursuing its own interests instead of being tied to blocs of countries.
The article, entitled ""Trump and the West,"" won the attention of Bolsonaro, who has promoted the mid-level diplomat to lead Itamaraty, as the foreign ministry is known.
Araujo shares Bolsonaro's view of the need to rethink membership of the South American trade bloc Mercosur, which he and others in the president-elect's camp see as holding back Brazil's commercial interests.
Announcing the appointment with Araujo at his side, Bolsonaro said the diplomat's mission will be to promote trade with all nations without any left-wing ideological bias.
Araujo said he would make sure Bolsonaro's election brought a change of course at the foreign ministry that puts Brazil first, ""an effective policy based on national interest, a policy for an active, happy and prosperous Brazil.""
Araujo argued in his article that, unlike European leaders, Trump is saving western Christian civilization from radical Islam and ""globalist cultural Marxism"" by standing up for national identity, family values and the Christian faith. 
Bolsonaro, who takes office on Jan. 1, is reconsidering some of his campaign foreign policy stances, such as copying Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris Accord on climate change and moving Brazil's embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. The latter proposal has already soured ties with Arab nations that are valuable markets for Brazilian meat.
But he has stuck to his criticism of a program that brought 14,000 Cuban doctors to practice in poor and remote parts of Brazil, slamming the ""slave labor"" terms under which Cuba's communist-run government gets 75 percent of their salaries.
Bolsonaro has also insisted that Cuba allow the doctors' families be allowed to join them in Brazil for the program to continue.

1164,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 04:00PM ET</span>","Colombia to probe deaths of Odebrecht whistleblower, son","By Helen Murphy and Julia Symmes Cobb
BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's attorney general has launched a criminal investigation into the deaths of a whistleblower and his son at the center of a corruption probe involving Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht, it said late on Tuesday. 
Jorge Enrique Pizano, a witness in one of Latin America's biggest corruption cases, died last week at his home near the Colombian capital Bogota. Local media reported at the time that he had died of a heart attack.
Pizano, an auditor for the Ruta del Sol II roadway concession in which Odebrecht was a partner, had been assisting prosecutors investigating allegations that the Brazilian firm paid some $30 million in bribes to secure Colombian infrastructure contracts.
Odebrecht has been at the center of Latin America's biggest graft scandal since acknowledging in a 2016 leniency deal that it bribed officials in a dozen countries. Odebrecht did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this story.
The attorney general's office said in a statement it began an immediate investigation into the death of both Pizano and his son when it was informed that the son, Alejandro Pizano Ponce de Leon, died on Sunday after returning from Barcelona to attend his father's funeral.
It said that the younger Pizano drank from a bottle of water on his father's desk and was dead from cyanide poisoning within minutes. 
The hospital where the elder Pizano was taken shortly after his death said in a statement on Wednesday they had turned over tissue samples from an autopsy to the judicial police.
HIGHWAY PROJECT
The project Pizano audited was a 2010 partnership between Odebrecht and a unit of Colombia's Grupo Aval, the country's largest financial firm, to build a 528 kilometer (328 mile) highway to Colombia's Caribbean coast. The contract was worth about $1.7 billion.
Pizano had given an interview to local television channel Noticias Uno, which was broadcast on Monday but which the channel said was recorded in August. Noticias Uno said Pizano insisted the interview could not be released until he was outside Colombia or dead, citing fears for his safety.
In it, Pizano said he raised suspicions about payments made to unknown recipients by the Brazilian builder in 2013. He said he had informed Nestor Humberto Martinez, who was then Grupo Aval's legal adviser.
Martinez became Colombia's attorney general in 2016, after leaving his post with Aval. He has recused himself from the Odebrecht probe due to his prior role.
Pizano in 2015 had secretly made recordings of Martinez that he shared with Noticias Uno.
In the recording, Martinez wonders whether the payments Pizano discovered were connected to paramilitary groups or government officials. Many companies in Colombia, including some multinationals, have been accused of paying bribes to paramilitaries to avoid security problems in restive regions.
""We don't know if they are paying money to the paramilitaries, if there's corruption, if they're stealing,"" Martinez said on the recording.
Martinez said in a statement on Monday that he had helped Pizano pass information to Grupo Aval.
Grupo Aval said late on Tuesday that it supports all investigations into the payments but rejected any suggestion it had knowledge of them before they became public.
Odebrecht is suing Colombia for $1.3 billion, alleging the country illegally expropriated assets. Eight people involved in the Odebrecht corruption scandal have been jailed in Colombia, including an ex-senator and a former transport minister.

1165,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 03:57PM ET</span>",Possible witnesses against 'El Chapo' revealed at U.S. trial,"By Brendan Pierson and Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A defense lawyer for Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman on Wednesday named some of the former close associates of the Mexican drug lord -- including his alleged head of operations in Central America -- who will likely testify against him at a U.S. trial. 
Defense lawyer Jeffrey Lichtman said as part of his opening statement that he expected prosecutors to call Cesar Gastelum, Damaso Lopez and Miguel Angel Martinez, former drug traffickers who are now cooperating with authorities.
Gastelum moved tons of cocaine a week through Central America to Mexico for Guzman's Sinaloa Cartel, the U.S. Treasury Department said in 2014. Gastelum was later arrested in Mexico and extradited to the United States.
Lopez was at one time seen as Guzman's right-hand man before the two fell out over control of the cartel, according to media reports.
Prosecutors hope to prove that Guzman, 61, directed the flow of vast quantities of cocaine, marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine into the United States as the leader of the Sinaloa Cartel. He faces life in prison if convicted of the 17 criminal counts against him at a federal court in Brooklyn.
Identities of witnesses in the case had been kept under wraps, but they were disclosed to Guzman's lawyers shortly before the trial began on Tuesday, a prosecutor said in court. 
The trial is expected to last up to four months. Assistant U.S. Attorney Adam Fels told jurors in his opening statement Tuesday that it would trace the story of Guzman's rise from a low-level marijuana trafficker to one of the most powerful drug lords in Mexico, leaving a trail of horrific violence in his wake.
Prosecutors on Wednesday asked U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan to strike from the record part of the defense's opening statement in which it said Guzman was merely a scapegoat for Mexican drug lord Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada who was allowed to remain free by corrupt government officials. 
Lichtman said the U.S. government and Zambada ""work together when it suits them.""
Before summoning the jury into the courtroom, Cogan said he would not strike Lichtman's statement but would instruct jurors to consider only the evidence of Guzman's guilt, not prosecutors' motives or whether they acted improperly.
The judge also warned Lichtman the evidence in the case was unlikely to support many of his claims.
""Your opening statement handed out a lot of promissory notes that your case is not going to be able to cash,"" Cogan said.
Guzman was one of world's most wanted fugitives until he was captured in January 2016 in his native Sinaloa in northwest Mexico. He was extradited to the United States a year later.
As well as smuggling drugs to the United States, the Sinaloa Cartel has played a major role in narco violence between rival gangs that has torn areas of Mexico apart and defied successive governments.

More than 200,000 people have been killed -- many in cartel feuds -- since the Mexican government sent troops in to take on the drug gangs in 2006.

1166,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 03:48PM ET</span>",Justice Department calls Trump appointment of Whitaker lawful,"By Sarah N. Lynch
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Justice Department on Wednesday defended the legality of President Donald Trump's appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general to replace the ousted Jeff Sessions, rejecting the views of critics that the move ran afoul of the U.S. Constitution and federal law.
A legal opinion sent to the White House by the department's Office of Legal Counsel concluded that Whitaker's appointment as the chief U.S. law enforcement official was allowed under a 1998 law called the Federal Vacancies Reform Act even though he was not a Senate-confirmed official.
Democrats, some legal experts and the state of Maryland - which went to court on Tuesday to challenge the appointment - have said Trump violated the so-called Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution because the job of attorney general is a ""principal officer"" who must be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.
Whitaker, a Trump loyalist, assumed authority over the ongoing investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into Russia's role in the 2016 U.S. election - a probe that has led to criminal charges against several former Trump aides - after the Republican president forced Sessions to resign a week ago.
Top House of Representatives Democrat Nancy Pelosi accused Trump of dodging the Senate confirmation process and installing a ""political lackey"" to obstruct Mueller's investigation.
""The Appointments Clause in the Constitution - which clearly trumps any statute the administration's lawyers have chosen to cite - is violated by the president's brazen installation of a partisan hack whose reported history of shady business dealings, including involvement in patent scams and questions surrounding a taxpayer-financed loan, would preclude him from Senate confirmation,"" Pelosi said.
The Justice Department cited only one prior instance in U.S. history of a similar appointment as acting attorney general of an official who had not previously been confirmed to his job by the Senate, and that occurred in 1866.
'DOES NOT MANDATE'
The 20-page opinion stated that the Federal Vacancies Reform Act authorized a president to ""depart from the succession order"" established by a different federal law for filling a vacancy in the attorney's general position.
""It is no doubt that Presidents often choose acting principal officers from among Senate-confirmed officers. But the Constitution does not mandate that choice,"" Assistant Attorney General Steven Engel wrote in the new legal opinion.
Congressional Democrats have voiced concern that Whitaker, who in the past has taken issue with the scope of Mueller's investigation, could undermine or even fire the special counsel. Trump has called Mueller's investigation a ""witch hunt.""
Before ousting him, Trump criticized Sessions for recusing himself in March 2017 from the Russia investigation - now headed by Mueller but at the time conducted by the FBI. Sessions' recusal had given oversight of the probe to the No. 2 Justice Department official, Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller after Trump fired James Comey as FBI director in May 2017.
Maryland also argued that Rosenstein should have succeeded Sessions under the separate federal law that vests full authority in the deputy attorney general should the office of attorney general become vacant. A hearing on Maryland's litigation is scheduled for Dec. 19. 
Democrats, preparing to take control of the House after gains in last week's midterm congressional elections, signaled they plan to scrutinize Whitaker, who had served as chief of staff for Sessions.
Four senior House Democrats sent letters requesting information relating to Whitaker's past involvement with World Patent Marketing, a company accused by the government of bilking millions of dollars from consumers.
""It's significant that there is no precedent for a non-Senate-confirmed individual to serve as Acting AG (attorney general) within the past 100-plus years,"" Case Western Reserve University School of Law professor Jonathan Adler said.
Victoria Bassetti, a fellow with the New York University Law School's Brennan Center for Justice, said Whitaker is exercising the powers of a ""principal officer"" of the United States.

""Just putting that little word 'acting' in front of him doesn't change how the Constitution works,"" Bassetti said. ""You can't wave a little magic wand over it, sprinkle a little fairy dust and kind of color slightly outside the lines on this one.""

Online attacks against the small Gulf state have surged since Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt launched a trade and diplomatic boycott against Qatar in June 2017.
""Qatar recognizes that many of Twitter's efforts (to remove the more than 8-10 million fake accounts a week) have helped remove some of the weaponized propaganda and hate speech spread against our nation during the current blockade,"" Qatar's government communications office said in a statement. 
Automated bot accounts flooded social media last month, with many of them promoting messages which supported Saudi Arabia and cast doubt on allegations that the kingdom was involved in the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Twitter has since said that it has removed large numbers of accounts for breaching its terms of use in recent weeks, many of them originating from the Gulf region.

1170,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 02:15PM ET</span>",Shipbound migrants in Libya port say would rather die than disembark,"By Ahmed Elumami and Aidan Lewis
TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Migrants refusing to leave a cargo ship docked in Libya said on Wednesday they would rather die than be returned to land, as the coast guard began disembarking some of those on board.
In the first documented case of its kind, the migrants have been stranded on the ship since it intercepted them off Libya's western coast on Saturday and brought them to the port of Misrata.
A Sudanese on board, Biktor, said his brother and friend had both died at the hands of smugglers in Bani Walid, a smuggling hub south of Tripoli.
""How come you want me to leave the ship and stay in Libya?"" the 17-year-old said. ""We agree to go to any place but not Libya.""
More than half a million migrants crossed the Mediterranean from Libya to Italy in 2014-2017, before heavy Italian pressure resulted in the disruption of smuggling networks on the North African country's coast and the withdrawal of charity rescue ships.
Libya's EU-backed coastguard has also stepped up interceptions, returning migrants to detention centers notorious for poor conditions and drawing sharp criticism from human rights groups. 
Fourteen of the migrants docked at Misrata, including a Sudanese mother and her baby, agreed to come off the ship late on Wednesday, aid workers and a coast guard officer said. 
Libyan authorities were still negotiating with the other migrants, who have so far refused to disembark.
""I was stopped by this ship and I thought I would be sent to Malta or Italy,"" Mohamed, a 19-year-old from Sudan's war-torn Darfur region, told Reuters by phone before the disembarkation started. 
""I prefer to die but not to be returned to Libya ... it's a prison.""
The migrants are of Eritrean, Somali, Bangladeshi and Sudanese nationality and include a number of children. 
Some required urgent medical assistance, and the Libyan coast guard has allowed international aid agencies to provide treatment and food supplies on board, said Julien Raickman, Libya mission head for Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF).
He called for a peaceful resolution and said the most vulnerable migrants should be offered an alternative to detention.
""We talked to people who have suffered torture on the migration route and it seems abnormal that the United Nations cannot propose an alternative for them,"" Raickman said. 
After migrants are returned to Libya they are screened by U.N. agencies and given basic assistance before being taken to government-affiliated detention centers, where they sometimes cannot be tracked and may re-enter smuggling networks.
The U.N. refugee agency, which has resettled nearly 1,000 migrants from Libya this year, said in an statement it was ""closely following up on the situation of those already disembarked"" and ""continues to advocate for alternatives to detention"".

The far-right Bolsonaro, who takes office on Jan. 1, said in an interview this month that the 11,420 Cuban doctors working in poor and remote parts of Brazil could only stay if they received 100 percent of their pay and their families could join them.
Under the terms of the agreement with Cuba, brokered via the Pan-American Health Organization, Havana receives the bulk of the doctors' wages.
Bolsonaro threatened to break off diplomatic relations with Havana over the program, saying it trampled on the rights of the doctors by handing the Cuban government 75 percent of their pay and denying mothers the right to have their children with them.
""That is just torture for a mother,"" Bolsonaro said in the Nov. 2 interview with Brasilia's Correio Braziliense newspaper. He also questioned the qualifications of the Cuban doctors and said they would have to renew their licenses in Brazil.
Cuba's Health Ministry rejected Bolsonaro's comments as ""contemptuous and threatening"" to the presence of our doctors"" in a statement announcing its withdrawal from the program.
""These unacceptable conditions make it impossible to maintain the presence of Cuban professionals in the program,"" the ministry said in a statement.
Cuban doctors work in dozens of countries, some without cost to their hosts and others where Cuba charges a fee per doctor, most of which it claims goes to keep the free national health system in Cuba functioning.
The billions of dollars in revenues represent the most important source of export earnings for the Communist-run government.
Since the Brazilian program, called ""More Doctors,"" was started in 2013 by leftist former president Dilma Rousseff, about 20,000 Cuban health professionals have served in Brazil, including in 700 municipal districts that had never had a resident doctor, the ministry said. 

Bolsonaro said the program could have continued if it complied with his conditions. ""Unfortunately, Cuba did not accept,"" he said in Twitter post after the Cuban announcement.

BAR, Montenegro (Reuters) - Dozens of Montenegrin environmental activists and fishermen took to the water in the Adriatic port of Bar on Monday to protest at undersea oil prospecting, which they say will endanger marine wildlife and fisheries. 
The demonstrators had already spent the previous four days walking 144 km (89 miles) along Montenegro's coast from Herceg Novi.
""What they are doing is illegal, this is a crime against the Adriatic Sea, against nature,"" said Mirsad Kurgas from the ""SOS For Montenegro"" watchdog. 
In 2016, Montenegro awarded a 30-year offshore exploration concession for oil and gas to a consortium of Italy's Eni and Russia's Novatek.
The survey, which begins next week, is set to cover an area of 1,228 sq km (474 sq miles) and last 47 days. It involves a ship towing powerful air guns that cause a seismic reaction under the seabed, which can reveal the presence of oil and gas pockets.
The activists say the noise from the guns can injure or seriously disturb marine animals that rely on sound to find food, communicate and travel, potentially preventing spawning or driving them away altogether.
The Ministry of Agriculture, which approved the exploration, banned all vessels from approaching the main prospecting ship, whose arrival on Wednesday was postponed because of the protest.  
 ENI  (MI:ENI) said it would use the advanced technology to minimize impact on the environment, and try to keep disruption of fishing to a minimum. 
In a separate statement, Novatek said Montenegro's Environmental Protection Office would be monitoring the operation and could order an immediate suspension if marine mammals or turtles were found.
The head of the National Association of Fishermen, Dragoljub Bajkovic, said Eni had offered a total of 175,000 euros ($200,000) to 127 fishermen, but that this was not enough to cover long-term disruption to Montenegro's main fishing grounds.
""We will be suffering consequences for at least 10 years: spawning will be disrupted, fish will be annihilated,"" he said.
Montenegro, a candidate for European Union membership, produces no oil, but initial data has indicated it might have enough untapped reserves to cover its oil and gas needs.

""They will probably find what they want,"" said Milos Dasic, a sport fisherman, ""and we shall lose what we have and love - our sea, fish and sport.""

STRASBOURG (Reuters) - Tougher checks on European Union arms exports are needed and sanctions should be imposed on those countries that flout the bloc's rules, the European Parliament said on Wednesday.
EU lawmakers said European arms were stoking the conflict in Yemen, where a Saudi Arabia-led coalition is battling Iran-backed Houthi rebels. Arms sales to Saudi Arabia by EU states undermined the European arms control effort, they said.
""In Yemen, European weapons are fundamentally responsible for the war taking place,"" said German EU lawmaker Sabine Losing, who is leading efforts to hold EU governments to account.
The European Parliament's call to strengthen checks is non-binding but it the second time in less than a month that EU lawmakers have passed a resolution urging limits on arms sales following the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
The EU is the second largest arms supplier in the world -- exporting more than a quarter of all global arms -- after the United States, according to the EU's annual report on weapons exports.
That has pitted its values of peace and support for human rights against business interests.
The European Union's so-called Common Position on arms exports lists eight criteria governments must apply when taking a decision on an arms export license. Sales to Saudi Arabia violated six out of the eight, lawmakers said.
""The Common Position on arms exports must be implemented effectively. That includes, among others, a sanctions mechanism,"" Losing said.
French President Emmanuel Macron's government has come under fire from rights groups and opposition lawmakers over sales of French arms to Saudi Arabia. 
Paris has sought to increase its diplomatic weight in the Middle East through the sale of naval vessels, tanks, artillery and munitions to the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Monday that the government adhered to strict rules that ""stop us selling weapons that might impact civilians.""

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The U. N. Security Council unanimously voted on Wednesday to lift a nearly decade-old arms embargo and targeted sanctions on Eritrea after a rapprochement with Ethiopia and thawing of relations with Djibouti.
The resolution also urges Eritrea and Djibouti to work toward normalizing ties and settling a border dispute. It asks Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to report back to the council on progress by Feb. 15 and then every six months.
The measures against Eritrea - which include a travel ban and asset freeze on certain people and entities - were imposed in 2009 after U.N. experts accused Eritrea of supporting armed groups in Somalia. Eritrea has denied the accusations.
In July, Ethiopia and Eritrea declared an end to their state of war and agreed to open embassies, develop ports and resume flights between the two countries after decades of hostilities.
Then, Eritrea and Djibouti agreed in September to work on reconciling. Deadly clashes broke out between the Horn of Africa countries in June 2008 after Djibouti accused Asmara of moving troops across the border.

A November 2017 Security Council resolution said the peaceful settlement of the border dispute would be a factor in any review of sanctions on Eritrea. Both the United States and China have military bases in Djibouti.

GHAZNI, Afghanistan/KABUL (Reuters) - Thousands of members of Afghanistan's mainly Shi'ite Hazara ethnic minority have fled their homes in the central province of Ghazni as the Taliban have pressed into two previously safe districts, officials and witnesses said on Wednesday.
In heavy fighting over recent days, hundreds of Taliban fighters have seized large areas of Jaghori and Malistan districts, both heavily populated by Hazaras, a group that has long faced discrimination in Afghanistan.
""I saw Taliban burning the house of a local police commander, killing the commander and his son,"" said Mohammad Ali, who fled from his home in Jaghori to Ghazni city. ""The bazaar was closed, there was no food, no medicine and no power so we escaped.""
Roads into the area were closed and telecoms interrupted making it hard for aid groups and officials to assess the number of casualties, with problems facing those displaced made worse by plunging temperatures.
Fighting between the Taliban, a mainly ethnic Pashtun Sunni Muslim movement, and a militia led by Hakim Shujayee, a local Hazara commander accused of abuses against Pashtuns, broke out in Uruzgan, a neighboring province to Ghazni in early November. It later spread to Jaghori and Malistan.
The fighting has fueled fears over a possible upsurge in ethnic and sectarian violence. The Taliban say their fight is not against the Hazara population but against Shujayee, who has remained at liberty despite warrants for his arrest.
""He (Shujayee) receives government support, so our fight is against him and the government that provides support to him, we will punish him for his crimes,"" said Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid.
One senior official said at least 35 civilians, mainly Hazaras, and over 50 members of the elite Special Forces had been killed in the clashes.
He estimated that more than 7,000 people have fled from Jaghori and Malistan either to Ghazni or into neighboring Bamiyan and more than 3,000 homes had been razed.
Abdul Rahman Ahmadi, spokesman for the governor of Bamiyan province, which is adjacent to Ghazni and has a large Hazara population, said more than 4,500 internally displaced people had sought shelter in schools, mosques and private homes there.
""We are doing everything to help the fleeing villagers, many are in a state of shock,"" he said.
The United Nations's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Afghanistan said the situation within the affected districts was chaotic, leaving people trapped in the districts facing ""siege-like"" conditions.
Large parts of Ghazni province are already under the control of the Taliban after the militants briefly overran the provincial capital, Ghazni city, in August before they were pushed back by Afghan forces backed by U.S. air strikes. 
Prior to the fighting, Jaghori was known as a relatively liberal enclave with high levels of education and women's rights.
""Jaghori was the only district where women could drive a car freely and pursue higher education without worrying about militant attacks. But now it will all change,"" said one foreign security expert.

Earlier this week hundreds of people held demonstrations outside the presidential palace in Kabul. The protesters, mainly Hazaras, said President Ashraf Ghani had failed to address security challenges.

The boy weighs 8.5 kg (18 lb), less than a third of the average weight of a child his age. He fled hunger and poverty in his mountain village last year to find only more suffering in Yemen's third largest city Taiz. 
""This shows that the humanitarian aid that comes to Yemen does not reach people who really need it. Distribution remains random,"" said his doctor, Amen al-Asli. 
Western powers who have for three years provided arms and intelligence to the Saudi-led coalition waging war against Houthi insurgents in Yemen are now pressing for an end to a conflict that has killed more than 10,000 people and pushed the country to the brink of famine.
The West toughened its stance after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of Saudi policy, at Riyadh's consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. 
His death sparked a global outcry and exposed Saudi Arabia's crackdown on dissent and aggressive foreign policy, including its role in the war in Yemen, which has been criticized by human rights groups and U.S. lawmakers.
But calls for an end to the fighting have come far too late for millions of Yemeni civilians, including children, who face acute malnutrition and hunger in a complex, multi-sided war.
""They need a complete care, here in the hospital and later at home. Of course it depends on the parents' financial condition as malnutrition can hit the whole family,"" said Youssef al-Salawi, another doctor.
In Taiz, children fighting for their lives in hospitals are traumatized by daily artillery fire, rockets and anti-aircraft guns as Saudi-backed government forces battle the Iran-aligned Houthis along pulverized streets.
The United Nations says out of 29 million Yemenis, 22 million need some form of humanitarian assistance, almost 18 millions are considered hungry and 8.4 millions are severely hungry.
""We do hope that talk about getting the peace process back on track, that gives us hope, but it is very imperative for the people of Yemen that this conflict stops as soon as possible,"" said Stephen Anderson, the World Food Program's (WFP) country director in Yemen. 
OFFENSIVE ON PORT
U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths hopes to bring the warring parties together before the end of the year.
After seizing the southern port of Aden in 2015, the coalition has made little progress. While it has air supremacy, the Houthis have proved better at guerrilla warfare.
The Houthis still control Yemen's most populated areas, including the capital Sanaa and the port city of Hodeidah. 
The Sunni Muslim alliance led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates has renewed its offensive on Hodeidah, a lifeline for millions of Yemenis, as Washington and London called for a ceasefire.
Aid groups fear an attack on Hodeidah port would disrupt its operations and endanger more civilians as it remains the main source of food imports as well as much-needed humanitarian aid.
Street fighting and air strikes resumed late on Tuesday in Hodeidah despite a lull in battles as U.N. officials visited the Red Sea city to assess food security.

Geagea, leader of the Lebanese Forces (LF) political party, and Frangieh, head of the Marada party have been enemies since the early days of the 1975-1990 civil war.
The two parties had armed militias during the war, and fought against each other. The war, which drew in regional powers, included fighting between the country's main sects and rival factions within those sects. 
Both Maronite Christians, they met to reconcile at the seat of the Maronite Patriarch Bechara al-Rai in Bkerki, north of Beirut.
The meeting, where the two men shook hands with Rai and then with each other, comes after several failed reconciliation attempts over the years.
Geagea was accused of leading a raid in 1978 on the home of Frangieh's father, Tony Franjieh, a rival Maronite Christian chieftain, who was killed along with his wife, daughter and others. Geagea has said he was wounded before reaching Frangieh's house.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Angela Merkel's decision to give up the leadership of her Christian Democrats while staying on as German chancellor is a risk and an experiment, her protege and would-be successor Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said on Wednesday.
The conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) decides at a conference next month who will succeed Merkel as party leader, and whoever wins will be in pole position to become chancellor of Europe's economic powerhouse.
Kramp-Karrenbauer, the party's centrist general secretary, is one of two leading candidates. She is so widely seen as the continuity option that she is dubbed ""mini-Merkel"". 
Merkel had said the party leadership and chancellorship should be held by the same person, until her decision last month to separate the two posts.
""It is a risk, it is an experiment,"" Kramp-Karrenbauer told a business conference hosted by the Sueddeutsche Zeitung. ""Whether it succeeds, the coming months will show.""
Merkel's awkward coalition with the Social Democrats (SPD) has come close to collapsing twice and further infighting in her conservative bloc could prompt the center-left partner to pull out.
The chancellor's decision to give up the party leadership highlights her waning authority, dented by two regional election setbacks this year and a close ally losing his role as leader of her conservatives' parliamentary group.
COMPETING VISIONS
A poll last Friday for ZDF television showed 35 percent of CDU supporters backed Kramp-Karrenbauer to lead the party, with 33 percent favoring Friedrich Merz, a businessman and lawyer returning to politics after 10 years in the private sector.
Differences are emerging in their visions for Europe and for dealing with China - he bolder, she more cautious.
""With every wish to take Europe forward with a German-French nucleus, the proposals must always fit with German interests,"" Kramp-Karrenbauer said on Wednesday, adding that Europe must move toward a banking union, ""but first the risks must be minimized so that it is acceptable in German interests as well.""
By contrast, Merz last week made unusually frank comments on currency policy for someone seeking a frontline political position, saying Germany had benefited greatly from the euro and as a result had a responsibility to ""contribute more"" to hold together the EU.
On Wednesday, he told newspaper Bild in a video interview that Europe ultimately needed its own source of tax.
Asked whether there should be less Chinese investment in Germany, Kramp-Karrenbauer told the business conference the government should ""look carefully at which sectors this can be sensitive to, and touch on security aspects - and then decide.""
Last week, Merz, describing himself as ""a free-trade man"", said Berlin's approach of reviewing Chinese acquisitions of German companies was ""a second or third best solution.
""...This is something which you have to lift up onto a higher level in terms of international agreements.""
On the issue of taxation in Germany, both said reforms were needed.

Merkel said on Tuesday it would be counter-productive for her to express any preference in the CDU leadership debate.

The case, which was made public on Friday and is being investigated by prosecutors, is an embarrassment for Austria, arguably Russia's closest ally in the European Union. 
While most EU countries kicked out one or more Russian diplomats over the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Britain in March, Austria has hosted President Vladimir Putin twice since that nerve agent attack, including at its foreign minister's wedding. 
""There will be no unilateral action by Austria in that direction,"" Kurz told a news conference after a weekly cabinet meeting when asked if Austria would eject any Russians.
Kurz has cited his country's tradition of neutrality as a reason for not expelling any Russian officials over the Skripal case, even though Vienna is a major diplomatic center where more than 100 Russian diplomats are posted.
""The relationship between Russia and the European Union is regularly discussed in European forums. That is where this debate belongs,"" said Kurz, adding that spying by any country was unacceptable.
Britain blames Russia for the Skripal poisoning. Moscow denies any involvement and has also said it knows nothing about the recently retired Austrian colonel accused of spying for it. 
""This will of course not lead to an improvement in relations between the European Union and Russia. And yes, nevertheless we believe that fundamentally a channel for communication with Russia is important,"" Kurz said.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman announced his resignation on Wednesday in protest at a Gaza ceasefire that he called a ""capitulation to terror"", weakening Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's conservative coalition government.
""Were I to stay in office, I would not be able to look southern residents in the eye,"" Lieberman told reporters, referring to Israelis subjected to a surge in Palestinian rocket attacks before Tuesday's truce took hold.
Lieberman said his resignation, which will go into effect 48 hours after he submits a formal letter to Netanyahu, also withdraws his far-right Israel Beitenu party from the coalition.
Netanyahu will take over the defense portfolio himself, his party said. The loss of Israel Beitenu's five seats will leave him with control of just 61 of the 120 seats in parliament, a year before Israel's next election.
Political commentators had speculated that Netanyahu, who has high approval ratings despite being dogged by multiple corruption investigations, might bring forward the ballot. 
They also saw in Lieberman's decision to quit a bid to poach votes from Netanyahu and far-right cabinet rival Naftali Bennett of the Jewish Home party, ahead of an election.
Netanyahu's Likud played down the option of an early poll.
""There is no need to go to an election during what is a sensitive period for national security. This government can see out its days,"" party spokesman Jonatan Urich said on Twitter.
CRACKS IN COALITION
The cracks in the coalition could soon widen, however.
In Jewish Home, which has eight lawmakers, there were calls for Bennett, now education minister, to succeed Lieberman as defense chief.
Bennett did not immediately comment. Were he to withdraw from the ruling coalition, a snap election would be inevitable. But as defense minister, he could be no less a thorn in Netanyahu's side than Lieberman. 
Lieberman and Bennett have spoken in favor of harsh Israeli military action against Gaza's dominant Hamas Islamists, even as the government authorized a Qatari cash infusion to the impoverished enclave last week and limited itself to air strikes rather than a wider campaign during this week's fighting.
Israel has fought three wars in Gaza since Hamas took over the enclave in 2007.
Violence persisted on lower scale on Wednesday, with Palestinians saying a Gaza fisherman was shot dead by Israeli forces. An Israeli military spokeswoman said the troops across the border identified a suspect approaching the Gaza fence and opened fire at him. 
In a separate incident, the military said troops captured a Palestinian who tried to cut through the fence and threw grenades at them.
Netanyahu cast Israel's handling of Gaza as prudence.
""Leadership also means standing up to criticism when you know things that are classified and which you cannot share with the public that you love,"" he said in a speech. ""Our enemies begged for a ceasefire, and they know well why."" 
Hamas saw victory in the Lieberman's departure. On Gaza City streets, Palestinian burned Lieberman's photo and some motorists handed out candies to passersby in celebration. 
""Lieberman's resignation is a recognition of the defeat before the growing force of the Palestinian resistance,"" said Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri. ""It also showed a state of weakness that has overcome the Israelis."" 

Born in the former Soviet Union, Lieberman established an electoral base among fellow Russian-speaking immigrants. He also counts among his supporters other Israeli Jews who share his suspicions of Israel's Arab minority or oppose the religious authority and political clout of ultra-Orthodox rabbis.

PARIS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, who attacked his French counterpart in a series of tweets on Tuesday, should have shown ""common decency"" instead since the country was mourning the anniversary of deadly attacks in Paris, a French government spokesman said.
In five posts sent on the same day France marked the anniversary of the 2015 attacks that killed 130 people, Trump blasted the key U.S. ally over its near defeat to Germany in two world wars, its wine industry and President Emmanuel Macron's approval ratings.
When asked on Wednesday about the U.S. leader's Twitter posts, French government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux was critical.
""Yesterday was November 13, we were marking the murder of 130 of our people,"" Griveaux said. ""So I'll reply in English: 'common decency' would have been appropriate.""
Trump posted the tweets after returning to Washington from a weekend in Paris to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of World War One where strained relations between the American president and European allies were on full display.
On Tuesday, he rejected Macron's warnings against the threat of nationalism, made during an emotional ceremony in the French capital on Sunday attended by scores of world leaders.

Trump, who has promoted an ""America First"" policy, pointed to Macron's recent comments about Europe's need to protect itself, tweeting ""it was Germany in World Wars One & Two - How did that work out for France? They were starting to learn German in Paris before the U.S. came along. Pay for NATO or not!""

COX'S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Bangladesh has begun preparations to repatriate an initial batch of Rohingya Muslims to Myanmar on Thursday, but it is still unclear if any of them want to return, humanitarian officials said.
Bangladesh and Myanmar agreed in late October to begin the repatriation of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees, even though the United Nations' refugee agency and aid groups say doubts persist about safety in Myanmar.
There are also concerns that the Rohingya don't want to go back.
More than 700,000 Rohingya fled a sweeping army crackdown in Myanmar's Rakhine state last year, according to U.N. agencies. The Rohingya say soldiers and local Buddhists massacred families, burned hundreds of villages, and carried out gang rapes. U.N-mandated investigators have accused the Myanmar army of ""genocidal intent"" and ethnic cleansing.
Myanmar denies almost all of the allegations, saying security forces were battling terrorists. Attacks by Rohingya insurgents calling themselves the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army preceded the crackdown.
The repatriation of the first group of 2,200 refugees is set to officially begin on Thursday and officials in Myanmar say they are ready for them.
Bangladesh has vowed not to not force anyone to return and it has asked the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to make sure those short-listed to return really want to go back. 
Bangladeshi Relief and Repatriation Commissioner Abul Kalam said the UNHCR had begun interviewing families.
""We are expecting feedback from them today,"" said Kalam.
When pressed on whether the process would begin on Thursday, Kalam said: ""That is our plan, but we want to ensure a voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable return.""
U.N. rights boss Michelle Bachelet called on Bangladesh on Tuesday to halt the repatriation plans, warning their lives would be at ""serious risk"".
A UNHCR spokesman in Cox's Bazar said the agency on Tuesday began to assess whether any of the refugees wanted to return. One source told Reuters the agency had yet to find a single family who wanted to go back. 
""They are also not finding all the families on the list as many have fled to others camps,"" the source added. 
A second source said none of the 11 families interviewed had agreed to return. ""Today is not too different,"" the source told Reuters on Wednesday.
Earlier this week, dozens of Rohingya families on the list of refugees set to be repatriated began fleeing camps in Bangladesh.
Last week, more than 20 individuals on the list told Reuters they would refuse to return to Rakhine, saying they were terrified.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence expressed the Trump administration's strongest condemnation yet of Myanmar's treatment of Rohingya on Wednesday, telling leader Aung San Suu Kyi in Singapore that ""persecution"" by the Myanmar army was ""without excuse"".
Suu Kyi, responding to Pence, said people had different points of view.

""In a way, we can say that we understand our country better than any other country does and I'm sure you will say the same of yours, that you understand your country better than anybody else,"" she added.

1187,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 09:20AM ET</span>",Romanian ruling lawmakers push bill to cancel wiretap evidence,"BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Lawmakers in Romania approved a bill on Wednesday that would cancel wiretap evidence used to prosecute past corruption cases and could wipe out hundreds of convictions, including that of the head of the ruling Social Democrats.
The lower house vote, pushed through by the Social Democrats and their coalition partner, seemed certain to increase concern within the European Union whose executive on Tuesday criticized moves in Romania to weaken the independence of the judiciary and democracy. 
If it comes into force, the bill would retroactively cancel evidence intercepted by the intelligence services on behalf of prosecutors based on court warrants.
It could nullify hundreds of verdicts for crimes ranging from corruption to human trafficking, including potentially the case against Social Democrat leader Liviu Dragnea, a former deputy prime minister.
Dragnea, who backed the bill together with Calin Tariceanu, leader of the junior coalition partner ALDE, was given a two-year suspended sentence in 2016 for electoral fraud and is currently on trial in a separate abuse of office case, with a third investigation under way.
Separately, prosecutors want to investigate Tariceanu in a graft case.
Some previous attempts by the ruling coalition in Romania to decriminalize graft offences, reduce sentences and bring magistrates under political control have failed and the opposition said it would challenge the bill in the Constitutional Court.
""Serious crime cases ... from 2005 onward could be reopened based on this bill, not just corruption, but also murder, human trafficking, drugs smuggling and so on,"" lawmaker Stelian Ion of the opposition Save Romania Union told Reuters.
""They're using a cannon to shoot at birds, and it could blow up the entire judicial system.""
He expected the Constitutional Court to reject the bill as it has done in similar cases in the past.
The European Commission, the U.S. State Department, thousands of magistrates and street protesters have criticized the government's attempts to weaken the judiciary and raise the burden of proof.
The Social Democrats have shrugged off the criticism. They say the European Commission's report on Tuesday which condemned developments in Romania, was unfair and politically-motivated.

Dragnea and Tariceanu, who are respectively speakers of the lower house and senate, have accused the intelligence service of abusing its power by faking evidence and illegally wiretapping millions of Romanians. Prosecutors deny the claim.

1188,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 09:20AM ET</span>","Modi government, Indian central bank set for uneasy truce: sources","By Manoj Kumar and Suvashree Choudhury
NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's government and its central bank are getting close to ironing out some of their policy differences, said two sources familiar with the discussions, as they seek to defuse worsening tensions that had threatened to unnerve investors.
While the rift is far from healed, the sources said enough progress had been made to avoid acrimony at a board meeting of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) next Monday. The threat that RBI Governor Urjit Patel would quit, as reported by some Indian newspapers last week, is also thought to be off the table for now, they said.
The uneasy truce is likely to see the RBI ease up on some lending restrictions to help the government stimulate the economy, said the sources. One source said the central bank could agree to tweak restrictions on lending to improve credit flows for smaller companies with a borrowing limit of 250 million rupees ($3.4 million).
Neither the RBI nor the finance ministry responded to requests for comment for this article. The prime minister’s office declined to comment.
It is unclear how much of a role Prime Minister Narendra Modi played in defusing the tension. Local media reported that Modi met Patel last week in an attempt to sort out the contentious issues but officials in the prime minister's office and the RBI said they did not know of such a meeting.
Modi had appointed Patel as the RBI governor in 2016 for a three-year term that ends in September next year.
For weeks, government officials in New Delhi have been pressuring the Mumbai-based RBI to accede to a range of demands, from easing lending curbs to handing over surplus reserves to the government. This prompted RBI Deputy Governor Viral Acharya to warn late last month that undermining a central bank's independence could be ""catastrophic,"" bringing the feud into the open.
Tensions were expected to come to a head at Monday's meeting as government representatives on the board appeared to be ready to turn up the heat on Patel and accuse the RBI of being intransigent in the face of government demands. 
Now, it seems likely there will be a more constructive atmosphere with agreement on some issues, and disputed questions shelved for another day, the sources said.
CAN'T AGREE TO EVERYTHING
The government is keen to provide more stimulus to the economy heading into next year's election, especially as the incomes of many farmers have been hit by low crop prices. At the same time it doesn't want a bust-up with the central bank, which could badly affect investor sentiment and provide political fodder to the opposition Congress party.
""The government understands the regulator will remain a regulator and can't agree to all demands,"" said a government official, who declined to be named, referring to the RBI. 
While the official did not give any details of the solutions being worked out with the RBI, he acknowledged that the government did not want to trigger Patel's departure at such a sensitive time. 
There are five key state elections in the next few weeks and a general election due by May. The Congress party has already been harrying the government over allegations of corruption in a military jet deal with France and infighting between the top officials of India's equivalent of the FBI.
A RBI board member said that helping to ease tensions was the idea that both sides wanted a healthy economy. It was just a question of how to get there. ""The main issue is how to boost credit growth,"" the member said referring to the credit crunch facing small companies. 
Economics Affairs Secretary S.C. Garg is expected to make a presentation in the board meeting to outline the concerns of the finance ministry and could bring up the question about the transfer of surplus cash reserves held by the RBI, the sources said.
The board member said that an expert panel may be set up to work out the appropriate level of contingency reserves for the RBI, effectively kicking that question down the road. The RBI introduced a so-called corrective action plan in 2014 for 11 state-run banks with bad loan issues and depleted capital. That plan included curbs on risky lending and RBI officials said, as a result, the banks' loan growth fell to zero and had remained there since 2016, from 10 percent in 2014. 
  According to the RBI board member, the government wants the RBI to ease those curbs and lower capital requirements for the 11. 

Some improvements in the balance sheets of those lenders might give the RBI leeway to do that, although the RBI would prefer to give the mending process more time, said another official who is aware of discussions within the central bank.

Khashoggi, a critic of de facto Saudi ruler Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed in Saudi Arabia's Istanbul consulate last month in a hit which Erdogan says was ordered at the ""highest levels"" of the Saudi government.
Turkish authorities have prepared an extradition request for 18 suspects detained in Saudi Arabia, which includes a 15-man team that Turkey says arrived in Istanbul shortly before the killing and carried it out.
""Let the human rights units from all respected organizations, from the United Nations to the European Union, come and watch this trial,"" said Omer Celik, spokesman for President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party.
""Let them judge whether the trial fits the standards of international law,"" Celik, a former minister, told a news conference.
Turkey says the suspects should be tried in a Turkish court because the crime occurred on its territory, even though it was inside a Saudi diplomatic mission. Riyadh has said the suspects will be prosecuted in Saudi Arabia.
RECORDINGS
Khashoggi's killing has provoked global outrage but little concrete action by world powers against Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter and a supporter of Washington's plans to contain Iranian influence across the Middle East.
Turkey has several audio recordings including the killing itself and conversations prior to the operation which Turkey subsequently uncovered, two sources with knowledge of the issue have told Reuters.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian on Monday questioned remarks by Erdogan that Turkey had given the recordings to Germany, France and Britain. ""He has a political game to play in these circumstances,"" Le Drian said, when asked if Erdogan was lying.
Celik condemned Le Drian's response and questioned why the countries of the European Union did not produce a common response to the killing.
""Rather than finding out who gave the order for this massacre, everyone is starting to evaluate what position to take in the next stage regarding the interests of their own country,"" Celik said. ""This is an extremely problematic situation.""
A senior French diplomat later said Le Drian was neither confirming nor denying whether French officials had listened to recordings.

Germany has pledged to suspend arms exports to Saudi Arabia until the killing is explained, and has called for a common European response regarding arms sales to the Kingdom.

China banned group tours to South Korea in March last year after Seoul agreed to install the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defence System (THAAD). The move badly hurt South Korea's retail and service sectors. 
As tensions thawed between the nations, China in November last year allowed over-the-counter sales of package tours from Beijing and Shandong to South Korea, but kept online curbs in place.
Yonhap said on Wednesday that Ctrip was again offering group tours to South Korea. It later reported that the operator deleted those tours after South Korean media reported on the resumption.
""From this afternoon, Ctrip started selling group tours to South Korea, and Chinese authorities had signed off on them. Then, it rushed to delist those after heavy attention on Ctrip,"" said a tourism industry source quoted by Yonhap. 
In Beijing, a senior official at a Chinese online travel agency told Reuters that the ban on online bookings of group tours remained in place.
South Korea and the United States say the THAAD system is designed to better respond to North Korea's missile threat, but Beijing said the system's radar can probe deep into its territory, undermining its security.

""We assure the nation that his aforementioned absence has nothing to do with his physical health and wellbeing which have been the subject of speculation,"" spokesman Salvador Panelo said in a statement. 
""The president's constantly punishing work schedule is proof that he is in top physical shape.""
Panelo named four scheduled events that Duterte had not attended on Wednesday, during which the president ""took power naps"" to catch up on sleep, and said he would also skip a gala dinner with the leaders of nine Southeast Asian nations, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and several others.
Duterte's health has been a constant source of speculation since he disappeared from public view for a week last year, and he has said openly that he is tired and would like to step down before the end of his term ends in 2022.
Last month Duterte's office revealed that he had undergone a colonoscopy and he told reporters that a biopsy had shown he did not have cancer.
The constitution provides for the public to be told of the state of health of an incumbent president, if serious.
If a sitting president dies, is permanently disabled or removed through impeachment, the vice president succeeds to serve the remaining years in a six-year, single term.
Vice President Leni Robredo, a leader of the opposition, was elected separately in 2016. Speculation about Duterte's health last month prompted concern that the Philippines could be headed for uncertainty given the highly polarized political climate.
Duterte has cited Robredo's ""incompetence"" as a reason for his inability to quit as president.
Duterte has a record of skipping summit sessions, though he did not miss any as host when the Philippines held the chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) last year.
Panelo said it was ""amusing that some quarters are making a big fuss"" of Duterte's absences, noting that he had attended ASEAN meetings with leaders from China, Japan and Russia.
""Last night, the president worked late and had only less than three hours of sleep,"" he said. ""It is unfortunate that the first event scheduled today was at 8:30a.m.""

Duterte is known for having an unorthodox working schedule that typically starts mid-afternoon and includes cabinet meetings that can go on beyond midnight.

The manufacturer had been told to carry out a ""precautionary inspection"" of the system which controls the tail rotor.
""Investigation of the tail rotor control system is being carried out as a priority,"" the air accident investigators said in a three-page report.
Thai businessman Vichai, 60, was killed last month along with four others when the helicopter crashed outside the King Power Stadium in the central English city of Leicester after a Premier League match.
Vichai bought the unheralded central England side in 2010 and went on to stun the soccer world by beating odds of 5,000/1 to win the Premier League title in 2016.
Investigators have so far found that at the time of the crash the weather was good with clear visibility.

The legislation is part of a broader effort by the ruling eurosceptic Law and Justice party to bolster state coffers and fund its expensive social spending policies.
PAP said the labor ministry had expected higher pension and disability contributions to bring in an additional 5.4 billion zloty ($1.4 billion) this year alone.
That would have helped the government reduce its budget deficit, which it currently expects to come to 41.5 billion zloty in 2018.
PiS, a grouping with a left-leaning economic policy and a nationalist agenda, had wanted to eliminate a cap on contributions which had been introduced by previous governments to reflect the limits on state pensions.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's prestigious Peking University, historically a bastion of student activism, has moved to quash dissent and strengthen Communist Party control after a spate of protests across China on issues ranging from labor rights to #MeToo.
The clampdown comes amid an ongoing tightening of control over various aspects of Chinese society since President Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, a period that has seen increasing censorship and shrinking space for protests, including on campuses.
Late on Wednesday, the university, informally known as Beida, warned all students against taking part in demonstrations of support for recent labor-rights activism involving former students and said they would be held responsible if they ""challenged the law"".
""The school believes that the majority of students are sensible, but if there are those near you who are spreading rumors or reactionary sentiments, regardless if they are your teacher or your friend or your schoolmate, please keep a firm stance,"" students were told over instant messaging platforms.
On Tuesday, the Communist Party committee at Beida set up new bodies responsible for disciplinary inspection tours and campus ""control and management"", according to a document released by the committee and seen by Reuters, moves that tighten enforcement of party discipline. 
The committee also held a meeting for all campus members and told them that a recent graduate who was among those missing following weekend labor protests was working with an illegal organization, a source briefed on the meeting told Reuters.
A spokesman for Peking University contacted by Reuters on Wednesday said that they were not able to immediately comment on the meeting or warnings to students.
The campus attendees were told that the group in question, which was not identified, had a charter and ""passwords"" and the government had sanctioned the arrest of Zhang Shengye, the former student, the source said, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation.
Beijing-based political commentator Zhang Lifan said the measures were likely in response to student activism. ""The Communist Party is highly sensitive to any kind of organized movement on university campuses,"" he said.
ACTIVIST HISTORY
Students at Peking University, set on a sprawling, leafy campus in northwestern Beijing, played a central role in launching the anti-imperialist May Fourth Movement in 1919 and the pro-democracy Tiananmen protests in 1989.
But campus activism has been increasingly marginalized in the Xi era, and a movement that saw students and recent graduates of universities including Beida team up with labor activists to support factory workers fighting the right to set up their own union has been dealt with harshly by authorities, attracting international media coverage.
Last month, the party announced that Qiu Shuiping, an official with little experience of running a school who has spent years in China's legal system, including as head of the Beijing state security bureau, had been made party secretary of the university, an appointment seen by experts on Chinese politics as heralding a tougher disciplinary line.
ACTIVIST DISAPPEARANCES
Over the weekend, at least 12 labor activists, mostly students and recent graduates, went missing in the cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Wuhan in what a source close to them believed was a coordinated effort to silence them.
Five of those were recent graduates of Peking. One of them, Zhang, was grabbed by unidentified men and bundled into a car on the campus. The university told Reuters that the incident was a lawful seizure by police of a suspect and did not involve students.
The incident sparked a flurry of activity from a group of students, who call themselves a ""concern group for missing Peking university graduates"", and handed out information about the abduction and other missing students in a university cafeteria on Sunday.
On Monday and Tuesday, students who had spoken out or supported the labor rights movement were warned by teachers, their parents and what appeared to be plainclothes policemen, according to one of the students, who declined to be named.
In the meetings, students were told that the university had previously protected them because they were ""bewitched"" by the group, but from now on anyone who demonstrated on behalf of those missing or handed out leaflets would not be protected, the student said.
""They did not say specifically which law had been broken or how, and they did not give an explanation of why they had unscrupulously seized people on campus,"" the student said.

""Zhang Shengye was someone who was concerned about society, cared about the lower-classes and was close to workers. Why would someone like that be treated like this?""

Najib and his wife, Rosmah Mansor, who was for years criticized for her extravagant lifestyle, are at the center of a wide-ranging graft investigation launched after a stunning election victory and return to power as prime minister in May by veteran leader Mahathir Mohamad.
Najib has been charged with 38 counts of graft since his election defeat, mostly to do with state fund 1Malaysian Development Berhad (1MDB). Rosmah was last month charged with 17 money laundering offences.
Najib and Rosmah have pleaded not guilty to all charges.
Rosmah will face several charges on Thursday regarding solar power supply and installation projects in schools in the state of Sarawak, Malaysia's Anti-Corruption Commission said in a statement.
Authorities did not say what the charges would be.
Rizal Mansor, a former special officer to Najib, will also be charged in connection with the same case. 
The anti-graft agency said Tengku Adnan Tengku Mansor, a former minister in Najib's cabinet, will also be charged on Thursday related to a land sale. 
The 1MDB scandal was one of the major reasons for Najib's election loss. 
The fund is the subject of corruption and money-laundering investigations in at least six countries.
In civil lawsuits over the last two years, U.S. authorities allege that $4.5 billion was siphoned from 1MDB and about $700 million was diverted into Najib's personal bank accounts.
U.S. prosecutors filed criminal charges against two former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) bankers this month as part of their 1MDB investigations. 

Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho, described by U.S. and Malaysian authorities as central to the 1MDB fraud, was also charged. He remains at large.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The lawmaker expected to head the powerful House Oversight Committee in the new U.S. Congress says one of his first priorities will be investigating why President Donald Trump's administration decided to ask about citizenship on the 2020 census questionnaire.
Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings told Reuters he had not yet prioritized all the issues his committee would examine when his party takes over leadership of the House of Representatives in January.
""There are certain things that mandate that we look at immediately. One of them is the census, because that's right around the corner,"" Cummings told Reuters on Tuesday evening outside the House.
Last month, Cummings called for an official probe into why the Commerce Department added the question, which critics have said could depress the response to the census from immigrants, who often live in Democratic-leaning areas. If undercounted, areas with high immigrant populations could lose seats in the U.S. House.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced the citizenship question in March, billing it as a way to help enforce the Voting Rights Act. The act requires a tally of citizens of voting age to protect minorities against discrimination.
Eighteen states and 15 cities have sued the administration to have the question removed, calling it unconstitutional.
U.S. congressional elections last week gave Democrats control of the House, starting in January. Incoming Democratic committee chairs are expected to bombard the Trump administration with investigations, issuing subpoenas and holding hearings.
The oversight panel Cummings is expected to chair has wide-ranging jurisdiction over the government. He has foreshadowed a broad, aggressive agenda, including a look at Trump's business interests as well as ""day-to-day"" issues like prescription drug pricing and voter suppression.
As for the census citizenship question, Cummings said the oversight panel needed to ""figure out why it's there, because to be very frank with you, we have been told some untruths"" by the administration. By shining light on the origins of the question, he hoped ultimately to be rid of it, Cummings said, perhaps by aiding court battles launched against it.

In October, Cummings questioned the Commerce Department's contention that it added the question at the request of the Justice Department, saying court documents indicated Commerce initiated the idea - in coordination with former White House adviser and conservative firebrand Steve Bannon.

The men were charged with planning to attack prominent sites in Australia's second city on Christmas Day that year in what authorities described as ""an imminent terrorist event"" inspired by Islamic State.
A jury found the men - Abdullah Chaarani, 27, Ahmed Mohamed, 25, and Hamza Abbas, 23 - guilty on Nov. 2, but the verdict was not announced at the request of their lawyers. 
On Wednesday, an appeal court tribunal overturned the suppression order, saying the verdict should be made public.
""The trial has been fully reported and that genie cannot be put back in the bottle,"" the tribunal's three judges said in their ruling.
""A cursory Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) search of the applicants' names instantly reveals the subject matter, evidence and submissions in the trial,"" the judges wrote.
Not publishing the verdicts in a much-publicized trial ""would be likely to undermine public confidence in the system of criminal justice"", they said.
The men will be sentenced later.
After the men were charged in 2016, then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull called their plan ""one of the most substantial terrorist plots that have been disrupted over the last several years"".
The men had targeted locations in Melbourne, including Federation Square (NYSE:SQ), Flinders Street Station and St Paul's Cathedral for attack ""possibly on Christmas Day"", according to authorities.
The plot was inspired by the Islamic State militant group and the suspects had been under surveillance for weeks, police said at the time.
One of the men was an Egyptian-born Australian and the others were Australian-born of Lebanese descent, police said.
The verdict was made public five days after a Somali-born man set fire to a pickup truck full of gas cylinders in central Melbourne and stabbed three people, killing one, before he was shot by police. The attacker later died.

1202,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 06:00AM ET</span>","Making waves in West, China luring Pacific islands with Belt and Road","By Charlotte Greenfield and Colin Packham
WELLINGTON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - President Xi Jinping will showcase China's Belt and Road initiative to Pacific leaders at a regional summit on Friday, diplomats say, with Western countries watching warily for signs of Beijing's growing clout.
The competition for influence between China and Western allies Australia, New Zealand and the United States, is likely to provide a strong undercurrent at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Port Moresby, the capital of Papua New Guinea.
""China is showing a desire for a bigger role in the region, and that is out in the open like it has never been before,"" said a senior British diplomat who declined to be named as she is not authorized to talk to the media.
China has said it will announce ""important measures for further cooperation"" at the summit. Western diplomats believe that probably means formally extending its Belt and Road plans into the Pacific.
First proposed by Xi in 2013, the initiative promotes expanding land and sea links between Asia, Africa and Europe, with billions of dollars pledged for infrastructure development.
Western governments harbor suspicions that Beijing's professed desire to spread prosperity masks an underlying intention to become a more dominant power.
Tongan Prime Minister 'Akilisi Pōhiva is one of several island nation leaders who will meet collectively with Xi, having already been asked by Beijing to sign up to the Belt and Road.
""We're discussing that right now"","" Lopeti Senituli, a political advisor to the Tongan premier, told Reuters.
For Pacific nations, China may offer support for much needed infrastructure and development. Xi's vision to provide links to a bigger marketplace could also prove hard to resist for leaders of the remote, fledgling economies.
WHOSE PATCH?
For China, extending its influence into the Pacific would lessen the sense of maritime containment, and also potentially secure support from grateful, indebted governments at international forums, where numbers can count.
Three sources familiar with the matter, including the British official, said that Western nations had been informed that Vanuatu, the Cook Islands and Niue have agreed sign onto Belt and Road.
Niue and the Cook Islands did not respond to an emailed request for comment, but the Cook Islands' Finance Minister Mark Brown told Radio New Zealand last week that his government would be signing. 
Vanuatu's Prime Minister did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Foreign Minister Ralph Regenvanu said in a message on Twitter that he ""did not believe"" Vanuatu had committed to Belt and Road but he would check. 
China's official Belt and Road website reported that Fiji had made a commitment on Monday, joining the likes of Samoa and Papua New Guinea.
China's footprint in the region has been growing in the past decade. Pacific governments now owe about $1.3 billion in concessional debt to China, raising fears in the West, that the region was becoming more susceptible to Beijing's diplomatic pressure.
A senior Chinese diplomat said on Tuesday no country can block Beijing's cooperation with Pacific Island nations. 
Xi's meeting with the island nation leaders, which a U.S. diplomatic source said will be held without observers from the West, comes after a series of Western initiatives to shore up ties in the Pacific.
Australia last week declared the Pacific ""our patch"" as it offered A$3 billion ($2.18 billion) in cheap infrastructure loans and grants.

1203,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 06:00AM ET</span>","Bangladesh police fire rubber bullets, teargas to disperse opposition protest","DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh police fired rubber bullets and teargas at a group of opposition party supporters in the capital, Dhaka, on Wednesday as tension soared weeks before a general election.
Activists of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) responded to the police action by setting fire to police vans and cars, as well as several motor-bikes, according to police and media.
""Our force was attacked without any reason. They were only trying to ease the traffic flow but suddenly they were targeted,"" said Masudur Rahman, a spokesman for the Dhaka Metropolitan Police.
The BNP supporters were accompanying an election candidate who was picking up election nomination papers from the party's offices in the city. 
Police initially asked the group numbering more than 500 to disperse because they were creating a traffic jam but an altercation ensued and fist-fights broke out between the BNP supporters and police.
The BNP said that at least 12 of its supporters were injured. Police said at least 20 officers were hurt.
BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir denounced the police action as an ""injustice"", and part of a government plot to exclude the party from the Dec. 30 election.
General elections are invariably volatile in Bangladesh where politics has for more than two decades been dominated by rivalry between two women leaders - Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia - both of whom have been prime minister.
Hasina, who is prime minister now, and Khaleda, leader of the BNP, are both related to former national leaders.
The BNP says a caretaker government is essential for free and fair elections as otherwise it says Hasina's ruling Awami League will use the machinery of government to support its campaign.
The BNP is in disarray following the jailing early this year on corruption charges of Khaleda, on what the party says were trumped-up charges to keep her out of politics. 
The last election, in 2014, which the BNP boycotted, was marred by deadly violence and criticized by international observers as flawed. 
An alliance of opposition parties, including the BNP, said on Sunday it would contest the election despite the Awami League's rejection of its demand for a caretaker government.
Hasina’s government has won global plaudits for letting in hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, but its critics have decried what they see as the prime minister's increasingly authoritarian rule. 
In particular, they have attacked her for what critics regard as the government’s heavy-handed policing of student protests this year and a crackdown on free speech.

BERLIN (Reuters) - NATO is developing new hi-tech tools, such as the ability to 3D-print parts for weapons and deliver them by drone, as it scrambles to retain a competitive edge over Russia, China and other would-be battlefield adversaries.
General Andre Lanata, who took over as head of the NATO transformation command in September, told a conference in Berlin that his command demonstrated over 21 ""disruptive"" projects during military exercises in Norway this month.
He urged startups as well as traditional arms manufacturers to work with the Atlantic alliance to boost innovation, as rapid and easy access to emerging technologies was helping adversaries narrow NATO's longstanding advantage.
Lanata's command hosted its third ""innovation challenge"" in tandem with the conference this week, where 10 startups and smaller firms presented ideas for defeating swarms of drones on the ground and in the air.
Belgian firm ALX Systems, which builds civilian surveillance drones, won this year's challenge.
Its CEO, Geoffrey Mormal, said small companies like his often struggled with cumbersome weapons procurement processes. ""It's a very hot topic, so perhaps it will help to enable quicker decisions,"" he told Reuters. 
Lanata said NATO was focused on areas such as artificial intelligence, connectivity, quantum computing, big data and hypervelocity, but also wants to learn from DHL and others how to improve the logistics of moving weapons and troops.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said increasing military spending by NATO members would help tackle some of the challenges, but efforts were also needed to reduce widespread duplication and fragmentation in the European defense sector.

Participants also met behind closed doors with chief executives from 12 of the 15 biggest arms makers in Europe.

Washington reinstated sanctions targeting Iran's oil industry on Nov. 5 as it seeks to force the Islamic Republic to accept tougher curbs on its nuclear program, halt its development of ballistic missiles as well as its support for proxy forces in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen.
""The Americans will definitely be defeated in this path. The path they have chosen is wrong and incorrect,"" Rouhani said. ""If they are being honest and they are looking for regional security, this is not the path. If they are being honest and respect the Iranian people, this is not the path.""
He added, ""They have made themselves more infamous in the world and in front of our people. It's clear for everyone that the incorrect and cruel sanctions of America will harm the dear and honorable people of our country.""
U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton said Tuesday that Washington intends to step up enforcement of sanctions on Iran and ""squeeze them very hard.""

President Donald Trump reimposed sanctions after withdrew the United States from world powers' 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, reached before he took office.

1206,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>","Israeli defense minister to make statement, may quit over Gaza","JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman was due to make a public statement on Wednesday and a source close to the far-right politician said he may announce his resignation over the government's policy toward the Gaza Strip.
""He is thinking of quitting,"" the source told Reuters, after Lieberman's office said he had opposed a security cabinet decision on Tuesday to stop attacks in Gaza, where a ceasefire agreed by Palestinian armed groups ended a two-day surge in fighting.
Israel's Haaretz newspaper reported sources close to Lieberman saying that he does intend to step down and has been planning the move for some time, feeling he ""isn't leading the defense establishment to the place he wants to go"".
Lieberman's departure would probably also mean withdrawing his Yisrael Beiteinu party from the ruling coalition. Without its five seats in the 120-member parliament, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would be left with a majority of just a single seat. That could prompt Netanyahu to consider bringing forward a national election slated for November 2019.
Lieberman's office said he would address media at 1100 GMT after convening a special session of his party. A Lieberman spokesman declined to comment on the content of his planned announcement.
Lieberman has spoken in favor of harsh Israeli military action against Hamas Islamists in the Gaza Strip, even as the government authorized a Qatari cash infusion to the impoverished enclave last week and, on Tuesday, accepted the Egyptian-mediated truce that halted Palestinian rocket attacks and Israeli air strikes.
Lieberman, a former foreign minister, received the defense portfolio in May 2016. Despite his hawkish talk on Gaza, he has been criticized by another far-right party within the coalition, the Jewish Home, as easily swayed by a cautious military brass.
Born in the former Soviet Union, Lieberman's voter base is made up of fellow Russian-speaking immigrants, and rightists and secularists who share his hostility to Israel's Arab minority and the religious authority wielded by ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence expressed the Trump administration's strongest condemnation yet of Myanmar's treatment of Rohingya Muslims on Wednesday, telling leader Aung San Suu Kyi that ""persecution"" by her country's army was ""without excuse"".
Pence also pressed Suu Kyi to pardon two Reuters journalists who were arrested nearly a year ago and sentenced in September to seven years in prison for breaching the Official Secrets Act. 
""The violence and persecution by military and vigilantes that resulted in driving 700,000 Rohingya to Bangladesh is without excuse,"" Pence told Suu Kyi in remarks open to the media before they went into private talks on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific summit in Singapore.
""I am anxious to hear the progress that you are making of holding those accountable who are responsible for the violence that displaced so many hundreds of thousands and created such suffering, including the loss of life,"" he added.
Leaders of Southeast Asian nations, who will meet Pence on Thursday, are also expected to call for those responsible for atrocities in Rakhine state to be held ""fully accountable"", according to a statement the Asian countries prepared for a summit, reflecting a stronger line being taken within the group.
Suu Kyi, seated next to Pence, was stony-faced as he spoke. 
The Myanmar army launched a sweeping offensive in the north of Rakhine state in late August last year, in response to Rohingya militant attacks.
Myanmar denies persecuting members of the Muslim minority, saying its forces have carried out legitimate counterinsurgency operations.
Suu Kyi, responding to Pence, said: ""Of course people have different points of view but the point is that you should exchange these views and try to understand each other better."" 
""In a way we can say that we understand our country better than any other country does and I'm sure you will say the same of yours, that you understand your country better than anybody else,"" she added. 
The United States has accused the military of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya, who are widely reviled in Buddhist-majority Myanmar. 
U.N.-mandated investigators have accused the military of unleashing a campaign of killings, rape and arson with ""genocidal intent"".
ARREST OF JOURNALISTS
Amnesty International this week withdrew its most prestigious human rights prize from Suu Kyi, accusing her of perpetuating human rights abuses by not speaking out about violence against the Rohingya.
Once hailed as a champion in the fight for democracy, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner has been stripped of a series of international honors over the Rohingya exodus.
Neither Suu Kyi nor her office have commented publicly about the decision by Amnesty International.
Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay did not answer calls seeking comment on Pence's comments on Wednesday.
Pence also said that Washington wanted to see a free and democratic press in Myanmar, commenting: ""In America, we believe in our democratic institutions and ideals, including a free and independent press,"" Pence said.
White House officials told reporters after their closed-door talks that he had pressed her ""multiple times"" to pardon the two convicted Reuters journalists.
""They had a very candid exchange of views on that,"" a senior White House official said. He declined to elaborate.
Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, the Reuters journalists, both Myanmar nationals, were arrested in the city of Yangon last December. On Nov. 5, their lawyers lodged an appeal against their conviction.
At the time of their arrest in December, they were working on a Reuters investigation into the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim villagers during an army crackdown in Rakhine state. Reuters published its investigation into the massacre on Feb. 8.

Suu Kyi has said that the jailing of the Reuters reporters had nothing to do with freedom of expression and that they were convicted, not because they were journalists, but because they had broken the official secrets law.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka's parliament passed a no-confidence motion against newly appointed Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa on Wednesday, presenting a standoff with the opposition and throwing the country deeper into turmoil.
Deputies from Rajapaksa's party rejected the voice vote as illegal, saying it wasn't scheduled and that the pro-China former strongman would remain in office.
It wasn't immediately clear what President Maithripala Sirisena, who triggered the crisis by firing Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and naming Rajapaksa to the job last month, would do now. 
Government officials said there was confusion about who was in charge. 
""We need cabinet approvals to go ahead with large value projects,"" one told Reuters. ""We don't know if a cabinet exists or not.""
Sirisena dissolved parliament last week and ordered elections as a way to break the deadlock but the Supreme Court ordered a suspension of that decree on Tuesday until it had heard petitions challenging the decree as unconstitutional.
Wickremesinghe, who had refused to vacate the prime minister's residence, said he intended to discharge his official responsibilities now that he had proved his majority in parliament.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said the no-confidence vote against Rajapaksa was supported by 122 members of the 225-member house. 
""A majority voted in favor of the no-confidence motion and thus the no-confidence motion was passed,"" Jayasuriya said in a statement.
But Rajapaksa's son Namal, who is also an MP, said the vote had not been put on the day's business and hence was not valid. Father and son left the chamber before the vote was taken and their supporters shouted slogans in support.
The instability in the island nation of 21 million people has raised concerns for its tourism-dependent economy, already expanding at its slowest pace in more than a decade. 
On Wednesday, the central bank unexpectedly raised its key policy rates, a move aimed at defending a faltering rupee as foreign capital outflows picked up. But the currency , slid further to a record low.
Sri Lanka, located just off the southern coast of India, is also an arena of contest with China. Beijing invested billions of dollars in ports and other infrastructure when Rajapaksa was president, raising concerns in India about losing political influence in its backyard.
WAR HERO
Rajapaksa, under whose rule Sri Lanka achieved its 2009 victory in a decades-long conflict against rebels from the Tamil minority, is seen as a hero by many among Sri Lanka’s Buddhist majority. He has been accused by diplomats of human rights abuses during the war, which he denies.
Wickremesinghe, who has sought to promote ties with India and the West to balance Sri Lanka's relations with China, said he intended to do his job.
""We will now take steps to ensure that the government in place before the 26th Oct will continue. I wish to inform all government servants and police that you cannot carry out illegal orders from the purported government that has failed to demonstrate the confidence of the people,"" he tweeted.
According to the constitution, the president has to appoint a prime minister who in his opinion can command the majority in parliament.
Sirisena has said he will never appoint Wickremesinghe as prime minister again. 

The parliamentary speaker has called the president's sacking of the prime minister to bring a former leader back to power a non-violent coup.

Kristersson's bid for the premiership had looked doomed to fail after two other parties in the center-right Alliance bloc said they would oppose any government that relied on support from the shunned anti-immigration Sweden Democrats who hold the balance of power in parliament.
Kristersson was rejected with 195 members of the 349-seat parliament voting against electing him as prime minister while 154 voted in his favor.
The Centre party, a member of the Alliance bloc, repeated its objections before the vote. ""The Centre Party will vote 'no' to giving a nationalist, populist party a deciding and unique influence,"" its leader Annie Loof told parliament. 
The speaker proposed Kristersson in the hope of forcing progress amid few signs that parties are willing to compromise after the inconclusive Sept. 9 election. Three more parliamentary votes to choose a new prime minister can be held before new elections must be called.
The Sweden Democrats, ostracized by all other parties due to their fierce nationalism and early links to white supremacist activists, had said they would reject any government that did not offer policy guarantees, above all steep immigration curbs.

TOKYO (Reuters) - When newlywed Akihiko Kondo returns from work at a middle school in a Tokyo suburb, he is greeted by the love of his life, who lights up - literally - in welcome. 
His wife, Hatsune Miku, is not flesh and blood but a computer-generated hologram.
Her ethereal existence did not stop Kondo, 35, from strengthening his commitment to her with a recent $18,000 wedding ceremony.
""I believe the shape of happiness and love is different for each person,"" Kondo told Reuters Television.
""There definitely is a template for happiness, where a real man and woman get married, have a child and live all together. But I don't believe such a template can necessarily make everyone happy,"" the civil servant said.
Hatsune Miku was developed as computer-generated singing software with the persona of a big-eyed, 16-year-old pop star with long, aqua-colored hair.
It is based on a voice-synthesizing program by media firm Crypton Future Media, which declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. 
The hologram recognizes Kondo's face and voice with its embedded camera and microphone and can respond with simple phrases and songs.
Kondo, who was convinced at a young age that he would never find a partner or marry, said he discovered Hatsune Miku singing on the internet. 
After deciding Hatsune Miku was ""the one,"" Kondo said he became devoted to his virtual girlfriend, who has thousands of fans worldwide.
Extreme devotion to celebrities is not uncommon in Japan, but Kondo's wedding did raise some eyebrows. While 39 friends and relatives attended the Nov. 4 ceremony, his parents did not.
The ceremony included the customary exchange of wedding rings. His wife's ring was placed on the finger of a stuffed doll shaped in her image.
Kondo received good wishes and congratulations from friends and fellow Hatsune Miku fans on Twitter. He was also accused of being a ""creepy otaku,"" or a geek. 
He was among 3,700 Japanese who signed up for marriage registration forms offered by tech developer Gatebox in 2017, enabling them to ""wed"" their favorite virtual characters, although the ceremonies have no legal standing. 
Nevertheless, Kondo hoped his wedding would inspire others to find marital happiness, in whatever form it might take. 

""People messaged me, saying they were encouraged,"" he said. ""I think it was nice to have this wedding for that reason.""

Navalny, Russia's most prominent opposition figure, wants to be in Strasbourg on Thursday when the European Court of Human Rights is due to rule on whether his numerous detentions by police in Russia have been politically-motivated or not.
He was prevented from flying out of Moscow on Tuesday over an unpaid court fine, which he said had been suddenly and illegally enforced as a pretext to stop him traveling abroad.
The Federal Bailiffs Service, which blocked his exit, did not respond to a request for comment regarding Navalny's allegations that its actions were illegal.
However, it told the TASS news agency on Tuesday evening that it had rescinded the travel ban after Navalny had paid the fine. 

The 42-year-old lawyer posted a photograph on social media of himself passing through passport control at a Moscow airport on Wednesday and said he had encountered no problems leaving the country this time.

The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration was approved in July by all 193 member UN nations except the United States, which backed out last year. It followed the biggest influx of migrants into Europe since World War Two, many fleeing conflicts and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and beyond.
But the Czech cabinet voted early on Wednesday not to sign the accord, a government source told Reuters, in line with indications earlier this month. 
""The Czech Republic has long favored the principle of separating legal and illegal migration,"" Deputy Prime Minister Richard Brabec told a news conference.
""That is what the Czech Republic's and other European countries' suggestions aimed for. The final text does not reflect those proposals."" 
The Czech concerns have been shared by the right-wing governments of Hungary and Austria, which have also said they will not sign the agreement at a ceremony in Morocco in December.
Bulgaria's coalition government, which includes the anti-migration United Patriots party, has also dropped out of the accord, and its parliament is due to vote on the issue on Wednesday. Poland has said it may follow suit.
The non-binding U.N. pact addresses issues such as how to protect people who migrate, how to integrate them into new countries and how to return them to their home countries.

U.N. Special Representative for International Migration Louise Arbour has called moves to shun the accord regrettable and mistaken and said the compact simply aimed to improve the management of cross-border movements of people.

Moshe Lion, a skullcap-wearing bureaucrat favored by two key members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s rightist cabinet, defeated Ofer Berkovitch, the 35-year-old deputy mayor, after neither took enough votes in a five-man contest two weeks ago to win outright.
Nearly final results after Tuesday's run-off gave Lion close to 52 percent of the vote.
The ballot was held as part of nationwide Israeli municipal elections in which many candidates run as independents or on non-traditional party lists, making it difficult to gauge any broader political impact from the results.
While Netanyahu’s own approval ratings are strong, a senior member of his party and cabinet who ran for Jerusalem mayor with his blessing, Zeev Elkin, came in third in the first round of the poll.
The Jerusalem vote was largely boycotted by Palestinians who make up a third of the city’s population. They live in East Jerusalem, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in a move that has not won international recognition.
Many Jerusalem Palestinians complain of entrenched neglect by the Israeli municipality. A Palestinian candidate who bucked the boycott by running for the administrative Jerusalem City Council failed to garner enough votes to get in.

Both Lion and Berkovitch had vowed to appeal to all sectors of the city, 21 percent of its Jewish population is secular and another 43 percent are religiously traditional and 36 percent are ultra-Orthodox.

Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were arrested in Yangon in December 2017. They were found guilty in September of breaching the Official Secrets Act and sentenced to seven years in prison.
Pence met Suu Kyi on the sidelines of an Asia summit in Singapore.

The official declined to comment on Suu Kyi's response in the closed-door meeting.
Lawyers for the two Reuters reporters have lodged an appeal against their conviction.

At the time of their arrest in December, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were working on a Reuters investigation into the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim villagers during an army crackdown in Rakhine state.

One of the two executed men was Vahid Mazloumin, dubbed the “sultan of coins” by media, a trader accused of manipulating the currency market, according to Mizan, the news site of the Iranian judiciary.
Mazloumin was allegedly caught with two tons of gold coins, according to the Iranian Students’ News Agency (ISNA).
The second man was part of Mazloumin's network and had been involved in the sale of gold coins, Mizan reported.
Both of them were convicted of “spreading corruption on earth”, a capital offense under Iran’s Islamic laws.
Special courts focused on financial crimes were set up in August with the approval of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in the Islamic Republic. 
The courts have handed out at least seven death sentences since they were set up and some of the trials have been broadcast live on television.
The rial currency has lost about 70 percent of its value in 2018 under the threat of revived U.S. sanctions, with heavy demand for dollars and gold coins on the unofficial market from ordinary Iranians trying to protect their savings.
The cost of living has also soared, provoking sporadic demonstrations against profiteering and corruption, with many protesters chanting anti-government slogans.
In August, the United States reimposed a first round of sanctions after pulling out of a 2015 deal between world powers and Iran under which international sanctions were lifted in return for curbs on its nuclear program.

The arrests follow last month's election of new President Nguyen Phu Trong, Vietnam's party chief and architect of the crackdown, which saw a member of the powerful decision-making politburo among those arrested and jailed.
Pham Thi Phuong Anh, deputy director of MobiFone Corp. and former general director Cao Duy Hai were accused of ""violating regulations on the management and use of state capital,"" the Ministry of Public Security said on Wednesday.
Police have accused the company of causing losses to the state budget by overpaying for a stake of 95 percent in a loss-making pay-TV provider, the ministry said in a statement.
MobiFone, one of Vietnam's three largest mobile carriers by subscribers, bought the controversial stake in Audio Visual Global JSC (AVG) in 2015 for nearly 8.9 trillion dong ($386 million).
In July, police arrested a former chairman of MobiFone and a senior official of the Ministry of Information and Communications accused of involvement in the case. 
Vietnam's information minister was suspended that month and replaced in October over alleged ties to wrongdoing at the company.
In an unrelated investigation, police arrested a former deputy labor minister last week over accusations of economic mismanagement.
Vietnam has opened 427 corruption cases this year to investigate 889 officials, its chief government inspector, Le Minh Khai, said in a statement late on Tuesday. 
Police have this year completed investigations into 212 other graft cases that involved misappropriation of more than $200 million and 300,000 square meters (3.23 million sq ft) of land, Khai added.
""Preventing, and fighting against, corruption will continue to be a key task in 2019,"" the statement said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Fijians went to the polls on Wednesday for only the second time since a 2006 coup, with former military strongman Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama confident of winning a second term even as heavy rain and flooding meant some voting was delayed.
Bainimarama, who leads the Fiji First party, seized power in the bloodless 2006 coup that resulted in the former British colony being suspended from the Commonwealth and isolated diplomatically.
He stood down from the military to run as a civilian in Fiji's 2014 elections, winning in a landslide. His main opponent this time is Sitiveni Rabuka, another former military leader who staged two coups in 1987.
The nation of more than 300 South Pacific islands has been welcomed back to the international community since the 2006 coup and subsequent election and even enjoyed a visit from Britain's Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, in October.
Torrential rain greeted voters on Wednesday and Elections Supervisor Mohammed Saneem said polling booths in some areas had to be relocated or voting rescheduled to a later date because of the weather.
Nearly 8,000 voters were affected in the nation of roughly 910,000 people, with 26 polling booths at 23 venues closed, Saneem said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post.
""I would like to extend sincere gratitude to all those voters who braved the weather and came out to vote to exercise their constitutional right,"" he said.
An election blackout remained in place for domestic media until all polling places reported. It was unclear what effect that would have on announcing election results that were expected later on Wednesday.
Rabuka, himself a former long-serving prime minister who leads the Social Democratic Liberal Party of Fiji, was cleared on Monday of charges related to breaching financial disclosure laws, enabling him to contest the election.
The elections were also contested by the National Federation Party (NFP), Fiji's third-largest party led by economics professor Biman Prasad.
The manifesto of the NFP, which has its base in Fiji's economically powerful Indian ethnic minority, says its priorities are a living wage for workers and farmers and lifting ""the climate of fear that covers our country"".
Jonathan Pryke of the Lowy Institute in Sydney said Bainimarama's government had done better than many of its critics expected and had reason to be confident of re-election. He said Fiji's economy had grown at an average of 3.6 percent over the past five years and standards of living had risen.

""These elections are significant, not only for determining who will govern the Pacific's second-largest and most developed country for the next five years, but in demonstrating where Fiji sits on its slow path back toward full and open democracy,"" Pryke said in a pre-election report.

LONDON (Reuters) - Prince Charles celebrates his 70th birthday on Wednesday by attending public and private parties, while his office has released new photographs of the heir to the British throne with his close family. 
The Prince of Wales and Queen Elizabeth's eldest son, Charles was born at Buckingham Palace on Nov. 14, 1948, four years before his now 92-year-old mother ascended to the throne following the death of her father George VI.
To mark his birthday, he will attend a special tea party heralding 70 inspirational people who also turned 70 this year, before heading to a private function for friends and family hosted by the queen. 
As Britain's heir apparent, Charles has waited longer than any of his predecessors to become monarch and would be the oldest king in a lineage that dates back 1,000 years. 
Charles has used his position to campaign on issues including climate change, architecture and farming, often raising prescient concerns about the environment, his supporters say. 
""When my mama succeeded and became queen and my grandfather died so young, aged 57, I ended up becoming heir to the throne aged four,"" Charles said in a BBC documentary aired last week.
""You have to make of it what you feel is right - there's nothing laid down so that's what makes it so interesting, challenging and of course complicated.""
However, critics have accused him of inappropriate interfering because British monarchs are bound by Britain's unwritten constitution to stay out of politics. 
In last week's documentary, Charles said he would stop ""meddling"" in campaigns which he felt strongly about. 
""I'm not that stupid,"" he said. ""I do realize that it is a separate exercise being sovereign."" 
The new photographs show Charles in the garden of his London home Clarence House together with his second wife Camilla, sons William and Harry, their wives Kate and Meghan along with William and Kate's children, George, Charlotte and Louis.
In the BBC film, William said he hoped his hard-working father would spend more time with his grandchildren.
""Now he's reached his 70th year, it's a perfect time to consolidate a little bit as most families would do; you are worried about having them around, making sure their health's OK,"" he said. ""He's the fittest man I know but equally I want him to be fit so he's 95 going on, so having more time with him at home would be lovely.""
However, William acknowledged that Charles still believed he had much to achieve.

""He hasn't even reached the point that his natural progression should do - i.e being monarch - so he's still got his job to do,"" he said.

TIJUANA (Reuters) - Hundreds of Central American migrants planning to seek asylum in the United States moved toward the country's border with Mexico on Tuesday as U.S. military reinforced security measures, laying barbed wire and erecting barricades.
Some 400 migrants who broke away from the main caravan in Mexico City arrived in the border city of Tijuana on Tuesday by bus, according to a Reuters witness. Larger groups are expected to arrive in the coming days, human rights organizations said.
U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said he would travel to the border area on Wednesday, his first visit since the military announced that over 7,000 U.S. troops would go to the area as the caravan of mostly Hondurans has made its way through Mexico.
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said in a statement that it would close lanes at the San Ysidro and Otay Mesa crossings from Tijuana to allow the Department of Defense to install barbed wire and position barricades and fencing. Tijuana, in the Mexican state of Baja California, is at the westerly end of the border, around 17 miles (38km) from San Diego, California.
""CBP has been and will continue to prepare for the potential arrival of thousands of people migrating in a caravan heading toward the border of the United States,"" Pete Flores, the agency's director of field operations in San Diego, said in a statement, citing a ""potential safety and security risk.""
The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has taken a firm stance against the caravan, which began its journey north on Oct. 13 and briefly clashed with security forces in the south of Mexico early on its route. 
On Friday, Trump signed a decree that effectively suspended the granting of asylum for those who cross the border illegally, a move that could drastically slow claims at gates of entry.
But migrants planning to seek asylum in the United States said they were undeterred by the crackdown. 
""I prefer to be in detention in the United States than to return to my country, where I know they are going to kill me for being different,"" said Nelvin Mejía, a transgender woman who arrived in Tijuana on Monday with a group of about 70 people seeking asylum. ""Last month, they killed my partner, and I do not want to end up like that.""
For years, thousands of mainly Central American immigrants have embarked on long journeys through Central America and Mexico to reach the United States. Many of them die in the attempt or are kidnapped by organized crime groups.

Several thousand more migrants in at least three caravan groups are making their way through Mexico toward the border.

The White House said Trump has chosen John Abizaid, who as a four-star Army general led the U.S. Central Command during the Iraq war, to be Washington's ambassador in Riyadh. Abizaid must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.
In addition to the scandal over Khashoggi's death, Washington is also grappling with criticism from U.S. lawmakers over its support for Saudi Arabia's military intervention in Yemen's civil war.
The United States has not had an ambassador to Saudi Arabia since Trump took office in January 2017.
Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist critical of Saudi leaders, was killed on Oct. 2. 
Saudi Arabia initially denied any knowledge or involvement in Khashoggi's killing, but a Saudi public prosecutor later said it was planned in advance.
Trump has expressed reluctance to punish Saudi Arabia economically, citing its multibillion-dollar purchases of military equipment and investments in U.S. firms.
White House national security adviser John Bolton said on Tuesday he does not think recordings related to Khashoggi's killing, which were shared by Turkey, implicate Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Abizaid is currently a visiting fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution and works as a private consultant at JPA Associates, the White House said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers will introduce legislation on Wednesday urging a stronger response by the Trump administration to China’s crackdown on minority Muslims, including possible sanctions against a regional Communist Party chief and other officials accused of human rights abuses.
The legislation will also ask President Donald Trump to condemn China’s actions in the Xinjiang region, call for a new “special coordinator” of U.S. policy on the issue and press for consideration of a ban on export of U.S. technology that Beijing could use in surveillance and mass detention of ethnic Uighurs, according to a copy of the measure seen by Reuters.
The lawmakers want the Trump administration to consider human rights-related sanctions against Xinjiang Party Secretary Chen Quanguo, who is also a member of the powerful politburo, and other officials “credibly alleged to be responsible” for the security crackdown, the measure will say.
“Chinese government officials should be held accountable for their complicity in this evil and U.S. businesses should be barred from helping China create a high-tech police state in Xinjiang,"" said Republican U.S. Representative Chris Smith, one of the sponsors of the bipartisan legislation that will be presented in both the Senate and House of Representatives.
The White House and the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the bill, which is also being put forth by Republican Senator Marco Rubio and Democratic Senator Bob Menendez
Trump’s senior aides recently have become more vocal in their criticism of China’s treatment of its minority Muslims in Xinjiang, which has sparked an international outcry. Any sanctions, however, would be a rare move on human rights grounds by the Trump administration against China, with which it is engaged in a bitter trade war.
Beijing has dismissed accusations of abuses in Xinjiang, urging the United States and other countries to stay out of its internal affairs.
China’s top diplomat said earlier on Tuesday that the world should ignore ""gossip"" about developments in Xinjiang and trust authorities there, when asked if Beijing would allow international observers to inspect camps holding Muslims there.
Western countries including Canada, France, Germany, and the United States have urged China to shut down camps in Xinjiang, where activists say as many as 1 million members of the Uighur minority and other Muslims are being detained. Far western Xinjiang faces a threat from Islamist militants and separatists, China has said in the past.
Rubio said in a statement that some Chinese officials were responsible for ""possible crimes against humanity.""
The Trump administration for several months has been weighing sanctions against Chinese officials and companies operating in Xinjiang, U.S. officials have said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The new bill calls for consideration of measures under the Global Magnitsky Act, which hits rights violators with freezes on U.S. assets, U.S. travel bans, and prohibitions on Americans doing business with them, and also under a federal law to target those involved in religious repression around the world.
It will urge the administration to report back to Congress on Chinese companies involved in the camps and ask the FBI to take action against any Chinese government efforts to intimidate Uighurs living in the United States.

The department also blacklisted Al-Mujahidin Brigades (AMB), which it said had links to Hezbollah and had plotted a number of attacks against Israeli targets from a base in the Palestinian Territories.
""Today's designations seek to deny Nasrallah and AMB the resources to plan and carry out terrorist attacks,"" the State Department said in a statement. It said the actions denied Nasrallah and AMB access to the U.S. financial system.
Later, the State Department announced it was offering up to $5 million each for information leading to the locations of Hamas leader Salih al-Aruri, Lebanese Hezbollah leaders Khalil Yusif Mahmoud Harb and Haytham Ali Tabatabaei under the agency's so-called Rewards for Justice Program.
The department said both Hamas and Hezbollah receive weapons, training and funding from Iran. Washington recently reimposed sanctions against Tehran after President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from a 2015 nuclear deal.
Earlier on Tuesday, Lebanese Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri blamed Iran-backed Hezbollah for what he called ""a big obstacle"" in efforts to form a new government.
Hezbollah, a heavily armed Shi'ite Muslim group, has been pressing a demand for one of six Sunni Muslim lawmakers allied to it to get a cabinet position. Hariri has refused to give up one of the seats allocated for his mainly Sunni party.
Earlier on Tuesday, the U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on four people linked to Lebanon's Hezbollah who coordinate the Iran-backed group's activities in Iraq and designated the son of the group's leader as a global terrorist.

The U.S. Treasury added Shibl Muhsin Ubayd al-Zaydi, Yusuf Hashim, Adnan Hussein Kawtharani and Muhammad Abd-al-Hadi Farhat to its Specially Designated Global Terrorists list. Al-Zaydi is Iraqi and the others are Lebanese.

(Reuters) - Hate crimes in the United States jumped 17 percent in 2017, with a huge 37 percent spike in anti-Semitic attacks, marking the third year in a row that such attacks have increased, according to FBI data released on Tuesday. 
The release of the data comes just weeks after a gunman burst into a Pittsburgh synagogue and shot dead 11 worshippers while shouting ""All Jews must die.""
According to the FBI's annual Hate Crime Statistics report, there were a total of 7,175 hate crime incidents reported last year by law enforcement agencies, up from 6,121 incidents in 2016. The agency did not offer a reason for the increase.
Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said in a statement that hate crimes were ""despicable violations"" of America's values. 
""I am particularly troubled by the increase in anti-Semitic hate crimes,"" Whitaker said. 
The report showed a 37 percent jump in anti-Semitic incidents to 938 from 684 a year earlier. 
The Pittsburgh synagogue massacre in late October fueled a debate ahead of the Nov. 6 national elections over U.S. President Donald Trump's inflammatory political rhetoric and his self-identification as a ""nationalist."" 
Critics say Trump's rhetoric has fomented a surge in right-wing extremism and may have even helped provoke the bloodshed at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood, which was the worst attack on America's Jewish community.
The Trump administration has rejected any notion that he has encouraged white nationalists and neo-Nazis who have embraced him, insisting the president's true aim is to unify America. 
""This report provides further evidence that more must be done to address the divisive climate of hate in America,"" Jonathan Greenblatt, the Anti-Defamation League's national director, said in a statement. ""That begins with leaders from all walks of life and from all sectors of society forcefully condemning anti-Semitism, bigotry, and hate whenever it occurs.""
Nearly 16 percent of the 4,131 incidents in 2017 involving race or ethnicity were fueled by anti-black or African-American bias, increasing to 2,013 from 1,739 in 2016, the FBI said. 
Of the 6,370 known offenders in the report, 50.7 percent were white, while 21.3 percent were Black or African-American. 
The 2017 data was compiled from reports voluntarily submitted by 16,149 law enforcement agencies. 

FBI officials said the agency will provide training next year for law enforcement officers on how to identify bias-motivated incidents and report that data to federal authorities.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States was the only country on Tuesday to oppose an annual draft U.N. General Assembly resolution on the work of the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) because it said elements of the text ran counter to the Trump administration's sovereign interests.
The resolution has generally been approved by consensus for more than 60 years. But this year Washington asked for a vote.
The draft text was adopted by the General Assembly human rights committee with 176 votes in favor, while there were three abstentions and 13 countries didn't vote. It is now due to be formally adopted by the 193-member General Assembly in December.
U.S. Ambassador for economic and social affairs Kelley Currie told the committee that while the United States valued much of what was contained in the resolution and an attached Global Compact on Refugees, some U.S. concerns were unaddressed.
""We regret that the resolution before us today contains elements that run directly counter to my government's sovereign interests,"" said Currie, citing references to a U.N. commitment to a global approach to dealing with refugees and migrants.
U.S. President Donald Trump used his annual address to world leaders at the United Nations in September to tout protection of U.S. sovereignty.
""We also have serious concerns with language ... regarding alternatives to detention and the 'need' to limit the detention of asylum seekers,"" Currie said. ""We will detain and prosecute those who enter U.S. territory illegally, consistent with our domestic immigration laws and our international interests.""
Trump's administration sparked outcry at home and abroad when it began to implement a ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy, which included separating children from their parents when they cross the U.S.-Mexico border.
U.N. states agreed a non-binding global migration pact in July, however the United States quit the negotiations before they began over sovereignty concerns. Separately, U.N. refugee chief Filippo Grandi has produced a global compact on refugees.

Currie said the United States was committed to helping refugees as close to their homes as possible and had given UNHCR nearly $1.6 billion over the past year.

WASHINGTON/PARIS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump attacked his French counterpart on Tuesday in a series of tweets that underscored how much the once-friendly ties between the two leaders have soured, just two days after returning from Paris. 
In five posts sent on the same day that French officials marked the anniversary of the 2015 terrorist attacks that killed 130 people in Paris, Trump blasted the key U.S. ally over its near defeat to Germany in two world wars, its wine industry and Macron's approval ratings. 
Trump returned to Washington from a weekend in Paris to commemorate the 100th anniversary of World War One where strained relations between the American president and European allies were on full display. 
On Tuesday, Trump rejected Macron's warnings against the threat of nationalism, delivered during an emotional ceremony in Paris on Sunday attended by scores of world leaders.
A stony-faced Trump, who listened a few feet away, has described himself as a nationalist and has promoted an ""America First"" policy. 
Trump, a real estate developer and former reality television star who owns a Virginia winery, said Macron has a ""low approval rating,"" accused France of unfair trade practices over wine and attacked the news coverage of his trip. 
Trump pointed to Macron's recent comments about Europe's need to protect itself, tweeting ""it was Germany in World Wars One & Two - How did that work out for France? They were starting to learn German in Paris before the U.S. came along. Pay for NATO or not!"" 
""By the way, there is no country more Nationalist than France, very proud people - and rightfully so!"" Trump wrote in other tweets, ending with ""MAKE FRANCE GREAT AGAIN!""
He defended his much-criticized absence from a commemoration event on Saturday, saying the U.S. Secret Service had vetoed driving to the venue because of logistics. The White House earlier had said it canceled Trump's appearance, citing poor weather that grounded a planned helicopter flight to the site. 
White House Director of Strategic Communications Mercedes Schlapp, meanwhile, cast Trump's Paris trip in a positive light.
""It was clearly a successful trip,"" Schlapp told Fox News on Tuesday, saying Trump and Macron ""had a productive meeting"" on trade and NATO. 
""He has sent a strong message to our European allies. And we have seen some changes and some positive shifts coming from our allies to pay more to NATO. We need their support,"" she said. 
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Monday that Trump had isolated himself at one of the weekend events by deciding not to attend the Paris Peace Forum, which Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin attended. 
Trump also traveled in a motorcade to the Armistice commemoration while most other world leaders walked the last 100 meters (328 ft) or so to the ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe. 
Asked on television if the United States was still a French ally, Le Drain answered yes.
Before his arrival, Trump had blasted comments that Macron made in a radio interview in which he appeared to cast the United States as a threat.
Both French officials and the White House said any misunderstandings had been cleared up after Macron and Trump held talks on Saturday. 
In Washington, U.S. Defense Secretary Mattis on Tuesday backed NATO.
Asked whether he supported an EU military, Mattis told reporters: ""We see NATO as the cornerstone for the protection of Europe in the security realm and we fully support nations doing more to carry the load.""
On Sunday, Macron delivered his hard-hitting remarks.

""Patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism. Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism,"" he said. ""When we say 'our interests come first, those of others don't matter,' we erase the very thing that a nation holds most precious, that which gives it life and makes it great: its moral values.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Trump administration envoy on Tuesday urged Syria's ally Russia to push for the release of Austin Tice, an American freelance journalist kidnapped in Syria six years ago.
Robert O'Brien, U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy for hostage affairs, said Trump would take measures necessary to facilitate Tice's freedom if it would help. He did not elaborate on the measures.
""We are continuing to call on the Russians to exert whatever influence they have in Syria to bring Austin home,"" he said. The Syrian government says it is unaware of Tice's whereabouts.
O'Brien came to Trump's defense when asked why the president has made no public pronouncements on Tice but had spoken out in the cases of Americans held in Turkey, North Korea and Iran. He said Trump and his top aides are closely tracking the case.
O'Brien spoke at a news conference called to announce a National Press Club drive for private donations to match a $1 million FBI reward for information leading to Tice's freedom.
Tice was 31 years old when he was abducted in August 2012 while reporting in Damascus on the uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. 
He has not been heard from publicly since a video posted online weeks after he disappeared showed him in the custody of armed men. O'Brien said the United States believes Tice is alive but did not elaborate on the journalist's condition. 
Washington has declined to identify who it believes is holding Tice but has sought the help of Russia, Assad's main foreign backer in the civil war, and other countries.
Tice's father, Marc Tice, said that he and his wife will travel to Beirut later this year on at least their seventh trip to apply for visas to enter Syria to seek their son's release.

The minister responsible, Andrew Little, said in a statement that he had considered experts' advice and committed to a plan to enter the mine around February to further investigate the causes of the accident and recover any remains.
""The process we've gone through to plan a safe re-entry has been extensive and robust,"" Little said. ""It is now our intention to get this job done, and try and find out why those 29 men went to work on 19 November 2010, and never came home."" 
A series of explosions ignited by methane ripped through the mine on the west coast of New Zealand's South Island, trapping 31 men, only two of whom managed to escape. 
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern had promised while in opposition the previous year that her Labour Party would try to enter the mine if it became the government, but later warned it might prove too dangerous.

The previous National Government had ruled out re-entering the mine due to safety concerns, a stance that had been opposed by many family members of the men who died.

The U.S. Treasury added Shibl Muhsin Ubayd al-Zaydi, Yusuf Hashim, Adnan Hussein Kawtharani and Muhammad Abd-al-Hadi Farhat to its Specially Designated Global Terrorists list. 
Al-Zaydi is Iraqi and the others are Lebanese. 
The State Department designated Jawad Nasrallah, the son of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist and described him as a ""rising leader of Hezbollah"". 
Proscribed as a terrorist movement by the United States, Hezbollah is a heavily-armed Lebanese Shi'ite Muslim group backed by Iran and a leading ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Iran also backs Shi'ite militias in Iraq.
The Treasury statement said the four individuals ""lead and coordinate (Hezbollah's) operational, intelligence and financial activities in Iraq"".
The Treasury accused al-Zaydi of smuggling oil from Iran and from Iran into Syria, of fundraising for Hezbollah and of sending fighters to Syria for Iran's Revolutionary Guards. 
Washington at the end of October tightened existing anti-Hezbollah legislation aiming to sever the group's funding routes around the world, passing amendments to the Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Act (HIFPA) of 2015. The four individuals are being sanctioned under HIFPA. 
Nasrallah the Hezbollah leader earlier this year said increasing U.S. pressure on the group would not yield results. 
Hezbollah was not immediately available for comment.

PARADISE, Calif. (Reuters) - Convoys of fire engines rumbled through the smoldering northern California town of Paradise on Tuesday on their way to combat still-active sections of the state's deadliest and most destructive wildfire in history, which grew by 8,000 acres.
Teams of workers wielding chainsaws cleared downed power lines and other obstacles from the streets, while forensics teams mobilized to resume their search for human remains in the charred wreckage of the Butte County town of 27,000, which was almost completely consumed by fire last Thursday, just hours after the blaze erupted.
The ""Camp Fire"" continued to rage in Butte County, about 175 miles (280 km) north of San Francisco, and expanded to 125,000 acres (50,500 hectares), more than four times the area of the city, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said.
The death toll stood at 42 people, the most on record from a California wildfire. More than 7,600 homes and other structures burned down, also an all-time high.
Some 228 people are still unaccounted for and listed as missing. Officials asked relatives and friends to keep checking with evacuation shelters and call centers in the hope many of them could be located.
The fire was 30 percent contained, suggesting a ""big chunk"" was under control, but full containment was not expected until the end of November and the progress would depend largely on the wind and the weather, Cal Fire spokeswoman Erica Bain said.
""Thirty percent is kind of where we're getting close to rounding the corner. When we're the 30s and 40s, they're getting a good handle on it. By the end of this week I'd like to see that number up to 40, maybe 45,"" Bain said.
A Cal Fire spokesman said firefighters were more optimistic than in previous days, although he warned some populated areas were still at risk because of steep terrain and unpredictable gusts.
""Things look much better than yesterday, due to weather conditions,"" Scott McLean told a briefing.
One hundred fifty search-and-recovery personnel were due to arrive in the area on Tuesday, bolstering 13 coroner-led recovery teams in the fire zone, said Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea. 
The sheriff has requested three portable morgue teams from the U.S. military, a ""disaster mortuary"" crew, cadaver dog units to locate human remains and three groups of forensic anthropologists.
Some 52,000 people remained under evacuation orders and 8,700 firefighters from 17 states have been battling the wildfires. 
In Southern (NYSE:SO) California, two people died in the separate ""Woolsey Fire,"" which has destroyed 435 structures and displaced about 200,000 people in the mountains and foothills near Southern California's Malibu coast, west of Los Angeles.
The Woolsey Fire was 35 percent contained, up from 30 percent a day earlier, Cal Fire said, as authorities reopened a number of communities that had been under evacuation orders.
Authorities were probing the cause of the fires. A spokeswoman for the California Public Utilities Commission said on Tuesday the regulator has launched investigations that may include an inspection of the fire sites once Cal Fire allows access. 
PG&E Corp, which operates in northern California, and Edison International (NYSE:EIX), the owner of Southern California Edison Co, have reported to regulators that they experienced problems with transmission lines or substations in areas where fires were reported around the time they started.
President Donald Trump on Monday night declared a major disaster exists from the fires, making federal funds available to people and local government agencies in Butte, Los Angeles and Ventura counties.
The pledge came two days after Trump blamed the brush fires on forest mismanagement, tweeting ""Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!""

The militants have launched attacks in recent weeks against U.S.-backed Kurdish forces on the Syrian side of the border, prompting Iraqi militias that operate alongside the army to reinforce in the area.
Abdul Mahdi said the militants were seeking to recapture territory they had once controlled on the Iraqi side, during Islamic State's self-styled caliphate that extended from eastern Syria to northern Iraq from 2014 to 2017.
""But Iraqi forces are carrying out their duties to pre-empt any attempts by Daesh (Islamic State) to infiltrate the border and cross into Iraq,"" he told reporters at a news conference.

Islamic State militants have since their military defeat in Iraq in 2017 reverted to insurgency tactics such as bombings and attacks on security forces, especially in northern Nineveh and northeastern Diyala provinces.

1235,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 12:40PM ET</span>",Germany's Merkel calls for a European Union military,"By Richard Lough
STRASBOURG, France (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel called on Tuesday for an integrated European Union military, echoing language used by French President Emmanuel Macron last week that infuriated U.S. President Donald Trump.
Merkel told the European Parliament such an army would not undermine the U.S.-led military alliance NATO but would be complementary to it, remarks that were met with loud applause in the legislature though also with boos from nationalist members.
""The times when we could rely on others are over. This means we Europeans have to take our fate fully into our own hands,"" Merkel said. 
""We should work on a vision of one day establishing a real European army."" 
Macron's call, which reflected a broad trend of EU thinking but is not universally accepted, was meant to show European willingness to meet U.S. demands that Europe do more for its own security and rely less on America's security umbrella.
However, on Twitter on Nov. 9, Trump accused Macron of seeking to develop the EU's own military to defend itself from the United States, which EU and French officials said was a misunderstanding.
On Tuesday Trump took aim at Macron again, blasting France over its near defeat to Germany in two world wars, its wine industry and Macron's approval ratings.
In his remarks on Nov. 6, Macron had been referring to computer hackers who could attack Europe from anywhere, including from inside the United States, officials said. 
First proposed in the 1950s and taken up four years ago by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker as a response to fraying EU unity, an EU armed forces is seen as strengthening the global power of the bloc, which is an economic giant but a geopolitical minnow.
With Britain's pending departure from the EU, there may be more momentum for remaining member states to find common ground on defense, although there remain divisions.
Supporters of a European defense union say the EU has struggled in military and humanitarian missions in the Balkans, Libya and Africa, and that it was caught off guard by Russia’s annexation of Crimea.
""NO PLACE FOR NATIONALISM""
Merkel's address comes at a time when the EU is searching for answers to a U.S. president who views the EU with contempt, to the rise of illiberal democracies and nationalist parties within its borders, and to Britain's vote to leave the bloc.
She made appeals for tolerance and solidarity, saying ""nationalism and egotism should no longer have a place in Europe"" to a sustained applause.
As a deadline looms for Italy's eurosceptic government to re-submit budget plans to the European Union, Merkel said the euro zone would only work if all member states meet their treaty responsibilities . 
""Our common currency can only function if every individual member fulfils their responsibility for sustainable finances,"" Merkel said, adding that otherwise the strength and the stability of the euro zone were at risk.
""We want to extend a hand to Italy,"" she later said. ""But Italy also agreed to all sorts of rules and it can't just tear them up.""
Merkel dominated European politics for over a decade, but she is now a diminished force, weakened by the fragility of her coalition and the rise of the far-right in Germany. She announced in late October that she would step down as leader of her party, though remain chancellor. 
Her foot-dragging over far-reaching reforms to the euro zone has frustrated the energetic Macron. In the summer, they agreed to a budget for the single currency area but failed to deliver any big-bang reforms. Few concrete steps have been taken since.
On Tuesday, she kept her vision for deeper monetary cooperation vague: ""We need to develop our monetary policy better. We're working on a banking union,"" she said. ""We have to look at responsibility and control, a banking union and then later a European insurance system.""
Merkel also trained her sights on Poland and Hungary, two countries whose leaders other member states worry are undercutting democratic institutions. 
The European Parliament in September voted to sanction Hungary for flouting EU rules on democracy, civil rights and corruption, while concerns have grown in the EU over Warsaw's accelerated judicial overhaul. 

""Solidarity is always linked to commitments of the community, and the principles based on rule of law,"" Merkel said.

1237,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 12:01PM ET</span>",Families get food in Yemen's Hodeidah during lull in fighting,"HODEIDAH (Reuters) - After a night of air strikes on Yemen's Hodeidah, calm descended to allow hungry families to stock up on food in the Houthi-held Red Sea port city on Tuesday. 
Saudi-led coalition warplanes had resumed air strikes late on Monday despite a lull in street battles between Iranian-aligned Houthi insurgents and coalition forces which had trapped families and endangered hospitals.
World Food programme (WFP) executive director David Beasley arrived in Yemen on Sunday to assess food security in the impoverished Arab country that has been pushed to the brink of famine by more than three years of war.
He visited a school in Hodeidah on Tuesday to oversee the distribution of food coupons which allow families to obtain a basket containing flour, sugar, milk, oil and canned beans.
""Thank God there is calm and security today. We went out to buy things for the house without fear,"" said Fattoum Ahmad, a housewife and a resident of Hodeidah city. ""There were no explosions or gunfire. I wish the war would not resume.""
It was unclear if the fighting stopped because of Beasley's visit and whether the U.N. had liaised with the Saudi-led coalition. 
The U.N. special envoy to Yemen Martin Griffiths welcomed the reduction of hostilities in Hodeidah and called on the parties to show continued restraint. 
""I am confident that the parties are ready to work on a political solution ... The logistical preparations are under way to prepare for the upcoming round of consultations. We are in a position to move forward,"" Griffiths said in a statement. 
The U.N. is reviving efforts to find a political agreement that would end a war that has killed more than 10,000 and pushed the impoverished country to the verge of famine. 
GRAIN SILOS 
The Sunni Muslim alliance led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates renewed its offensive on Hodeidah, a lifeline for millions of Yemenis, as Washington and London called for a ceasefire amid renewed U.N.-led peace efforts.
The international community fears that an attack on Hodeidah port would disrupt its operations and endanger millions of civilians as it remains the main source of Yemen's food imports as well as humanitarian aid.
An air strike hit the port's entrance on Monday and killed three guards, a witness and Houthi media said. 
The WFP is still unable to access grain silos containing 51,000 tonnes of wheat which were seized by coalition forces during the fighting, spokesman Herve Verhoosel said on Tuesday.
Verhoosel, speaking in Geneva, said those supplies could feed 3.7 million people in northern and central Yemen for a month.
The WFP said last week it plans to double its food assistance program for Yemen, aiming to reach up to 14 million people ""to avert mass starvation"".
The coalition has said that wresting control of Hodeidah would break the Houthis by cutting off their main supply line and force the group to adopt a softer stance in the negotiations to end the conflict, seen as a proxy war between Riyadh and Iran. 
The coalition abandoned a previous offensive on Hodeidah last June without any gains amid international concern over a humanitarian catastrophe to give peace talks a chance.

The alliance, which relies on the West for arms and intelligence, intervened in Yemen's war in 2015 to restore the internationally recognized government ousted by the Houthis, who control Yemen's most populated areas and the capital Sanaa.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry called on Hungary and its neighbors to reject Russian gas pipelines which Washington says are being used to cement Moscow's grip on central and eastern Europe.
Energy diversification would be crucial for the region, as Russia has used energy as a weapon in the past, he said.
""Russia is using a pipeline project Nord stream 2 and a multi-line Turkish stream to try to solidify its control over the security and the stability of Central and eastern Europe,"" Perry added during a visit to Budapest.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said Turkish stream, a pipeline under construction from Russia to Turkey, was good news for Hungary, as with annual capacity of 5 to 6 billion cubic meters one of it branches would bring gas to Hungary's southern border via a new route.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is seeking to encourage the purchase of gas from the United States or other suppliers rather than increasing purchases from Russia.
""(The) United States strongly opposes these projects and we urge Hungary and its neighbors to join us in rejecting them.""
Hungary largely depends on Russia for its natural gas supplies, which now mostly come via a pipeline via Ukraine. Russia is also building a nuclear plant in Hungary.
The government would be willing to buy gas from Croatia, which is building a liquefied natural gas terminal, and from Romania, Szijjarto said.

Szijjarto said that he had asked for U.S. help to support Hungary's diversification. A pipeline connection is not yet capable of carrying imported gas from the Black Sea via Romania.

GAZA/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Palestinian militant groups in Gaza said on Tuesday they would halt cross-border attacks immediately if Israel did the same after the most serious exchanges of aerial fire since a seven-week war in 2014.
An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, responded by putting the onus on the Palestinians to stop their strikes, saying Israel's actions would be determined by their ""steps on the ground"".
Since Monday, Israeli air strikes have killed seven Palestinians, at least five of them gunmen, armed factions said. Rocket attacks from Gaza killed a Palestinian, a resident of the occupied West Bank, living in an apartment in Israel, where he worked.
The salvoes were the fiercest since the Gaza war in 2014, the third between Israel and Hamas in a decade as part of the wider Israel-Palestinian conflict.
On Tuesday, the joint command of the Palestinian armed factions in Gaza said in a statement they would abide by a ceasefire mediated by neighboring Egypt ""as long as the Zionist enemy does the same"".
As far as the factions were concerned, an official in one of the Palestinian groups told Reuters, ""the truce has gone into effect"", conditional on Israel' actions.
Hamas and other armed factions fired over 400 rockets or mortar bombs across the fenced border after carrying out a surprise guided-missile attack on Monday on a bus that wounded an Israeli soldier, the military said.
Asked if Israel was heading towards a ceasefire, Yuval Steinitz, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet, told YNet Internet TV:
""I would say that a more accurate definition is that the Israeli military landed a harsh and unprecedented blow on Hamas and the terrorist groups in Gaza, and we will see if that will suffice or whether further blows will be required.""
Hamas said it was retaliating for a botched Israeli commando raid in Gaza that killed one of its commanders and six other gunmen on Sunday. An Israeli colonel was also killed in that incident.
Sirens rang out in southern Israeli towns on Tuesday and people ran for shelter after Palestinian rockets crashed into several homes overnight. The military said the Iron Dome anti-rocket system intercepted more than 100 projectiles.
Israel responded with dozens of air strikes, hitting buildings overnight that included a Hamas intelligence compound and the studios of Hamas's Al-Aqsa Television, whose employees had received advance warnings from the military to evacuate. 
In aerial attacks on Tuesday, Israel's military said it took out a rocket-launching squad and fired at several Palestinians infiltrating through the border fence around Gaza, which Israel keeps under blockade.
In Gaza City, people gathered in front of a large mound of debris that was once a multi-floor structure. It was flanked by five-storey buildings still standing after the air strike, their shattered stone facades adding to the tall pile of rubble. 
WEEKLY VIOLENCE ALONG BORDER
Violence has simmered since Palestinians launched weekly border protests on March 30 to demand the easing of the blockade on Gaza and the right to return to lands lost in the 1948 war of Israel's founding. Israeli troops have killed more that 220 Palestinians during the confrontations, which have included border breaches.
In fighting over the past two days, Israeli missiles flattened seven buildings, mostly in Gaza City including the TV station. Witnesses said warning missiles, which carry small warheads, were fired first.
Abdallah Abu Habboush, 22, said he was awakened by shouts from neighbors to get out of his residential building after what Israel terms the ""tap on the roof"" warning. They all gathered in a room on the first floor to wait out the attack.
""Old men who were with us fainted because of the smoke,"" he said, adding that he had no idea why the structure was hit. The An Israeli military spokesman said all of the buildings targeted were ""owned, operated and used by Hamas"". 
In the Israeli coastal city of Ashkelon, a video shot by a resident showed a bleeding woman, lying in the debris of an apartment and covered by dust, weakly raising her arm, next to the body of the Palestinian man killed in the attack. She was taken to hospital in critical condition.

Hamas, which is branded a terrorist group in the West, took control in Gaza in 2007, two years after Israel withdrew settlers and soldiers from the small coastal territory.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's top court on Tuesday agreed to review its ruling that removed a ban on women of menstruating age from entering a centuries-old Hindu temple in the southern state of Kerala, following widespread protests against the decision.
Thousands of people have been demonstrating against the Supreme Court's decision in September to lift a centuries-old ban on women or girls between the ages of 10 years to 50 entering the Sabarimala hill temple.
Conservative Hindu groups prevented about a dozen young women from entering the temple last month believing it would defile the sacred shrine and petitioned the court to reconsider its decision.
On Tuesday, the court said it would hear nearly 50 petitions seeking reimposition of the ban on women on Jan. 22, 2019. But until then, its earlier ruling on allowing women into the shrine would remain in force, it said in an order.
Sai Deepak, a lawyer for the Sabarimala temple administration which is opposed to giving access to women, said the petitioners had managed to convince the court that its landmark ruling needs to be reviewed.
""But I wouldn't go to the extent of calling this a victory for the devotees,"" Deepak said, ""because it is too early, too premature.""
The clash has highlighted India's social tensions, pitting religious groups sworn to carrying out ancient traditions against the court, which ruled that the ban on women was an infringement of their right to worship.
In some Hindu communities, menstruating women are regarded as unclean, leading to restrictions and in a few cases outright bans from entering certain places.
Political parties have also waded into the controversy, seeking to exploit religious sentiments as they gird for national elections next year.
Among the 49 petitioners seeking review of the court order are individuals and Hindu organizations including the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), a hardline group linked to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.

The temple, nestled in a forest on a hillside in the Western Ghats mountain range, is due to open on Friday.

The agency was handed the new task in response to an upsurge in the use of chemical weapons in recent years, notably in the Syrian conflict, where scores of attacks with sarin and chlorine have been carried out by Syrian forces and rebel groups, according to a joint United Nations-OPCW investigation.
A core team of 10 experts charged with apportioning blame for poison gas attacks in Syria will be hired soon, Fernando Arias, the new head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), told the Foreign Press Association of the Netherlands on Tuesday.
The Syria team will be able to look into all attacks previously investigated by the OPCW, dating back to 2014.
The OPCW was granted additional powers to identify individuals and institutions responsible for attacks by its 193 member states at a special session in June. The decision was supported by the United States and European Union but opposed by Russia, Iran, Syria and their allies, highlighting deep political division at the agency.
""The mandate is to identify the perpetrators of crimes committed with chemical weapons, but the OPCW is not a court or the police"", and will refer cases to U.N. organizations with powers to punish those responsible, Arias said.
The expert team will ""be in charge of identifying the perpetrators for Syria in the first stage"", Arias said, and might later be expanded to look at attacks globally.
The June decision followed attacks with other chemical weapons. In Salisbury, England, a former Russian spy and his daughter were poisoned in March with the military-grade nerve agent novichok, and the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong UN was assassinated in Malaysia with VX in February 2017.

Babis, a billionaire with farming, chemicals and media businesses, has long battled police charges that he manipulated the ownership of one of his firms a decade ago so that it would qualify for 2 million euros in European Union development aid.
He has denied any wrongdoing in what has become known as the Stork Nest scandal.
Six opposition parties said the case could not be properly investigated while Babis was still prime minister. 
""(We) call on Andrej Babis to resign as prime minister until the Stork Nest case is investigated. This is the only way to ensure fair investigation,"" the parties said in a statement.
The opposition parties lack the 101 votes in the 200-seat parliament that are needed to dismiss the government.
Babis told parliament in March 2016 that the firm in question, a hotel and conference center outside Prague, was owned by his adult children and his partner's brother at the time when the subsidy was approved. His two adult children and others have been charged in the case.
News website Seznam Zpravy tracked down Babis's son Andrej in Switzerland where he lives with his mother, Babis's ex-wife.
In what appeared to be a hidden camera interview on the doorstep of their apartment, Andrej Babis junior said he had been brought to Crimea so that he would not be called as a witness to the investigation.
He said that the person who brought him to Crimea was the husband of a psychiatrist who examined him and who had worked as an advisor for Babis senior in the past when he was finance minister.
Babis junior, who has received psychiatric treatment, said he did not believe him being moved to Crimea was his father's idea. 
""He (the man who took me there) took advantage of my father wanting me to disappear. Because of the Stork Nest affair,"" Babis junior told the reporters, according to published footage.
Police had looked into the case and ruled that no crime had taken place, a police spokeswoman said. 
Babis senior called the report a manipulation.
""To film a mentally ill man, secretly and in this way, that is heinous and revolting. This entire campaign is only aimed to put pressure on the investigators in the Stork Nest case, it is also used by the opposition,"" Babis said in a statement from Sicily, where he was attending a conference on Libya.
The opposition parties lack the 101 votes in the 200-seat parliament that are needed to dismiss the prime minister.
The government includes Babis's ANO party and the center-left Social Democrats. It also relies on votes from the Communist Party to have a majority in parliament. 

The Social Democrats nor the Communists have indicated they would join the opposition in the vote.

Macedonian police issued an arrest warrant on Monday for Gruevski, who resigned in 2016 after 10 years in power, after he failed to show up to begin his sentence following a Nov. 9 court ruling against his motion for a reprieve.
On his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page Gruevski wrote that he fled the country after receiving ""countless"" threats against his life. 
""I am in Budapest now and I am seeking political asylum from the authorities of Hungary. I will always remain faithful to the Macedonian cause and will never give up,"" his post said. 
A Macedonian police official who asked not to be named told Reuters that Gruevski did not leave Macedonia ""through a legal border crossing ... We are still checking information about where he is"". 
Dimce Arsovski, a spokesman for the opposition nationalist VMRO-DPMNE party which Gruevski once led, said he had no information about the ex-premier's whereabouts. 
A Hungarian government spokesman said he could neither confirm nor deny Gruevski's remarks. ""We are unable to comment on individual asylum claims which are still being processed,"" he said in an email. 
On Oct. 20, Macedonia's parliament ratified an agreement to change the country's name, bringing a decades-old dispute with Greece one step closer to being resolved. 

Eighty deputies in the 120-seat parliament voted in favor of renaming the Balkan state as the Republic of North Macedonia - just reaching the two-thirds majority needed to enact constitutional changes.

The plan is included in a draft document for a law on climate change which Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's government hopes to present to parliament by the end of the year.
""Some of the most important necessary changes affect transport,"" the document said. ""From 2040, the registration and sale in Spain of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles that directly emit carbon dioxide will not be permitted.""
Once finalised, the climate change law will require approval by parliament, where Sanchez holds less than a quarter of the seats.
Sanchez has struggled to find support for any major proposals, including next year's budget, in the face of opposition led by the conservative People's Party which dominates the upper and lower houses.
Britain and France have already pledged to ban petrol and diesel cars from 2040, which will mean big changes for the global car industry and put a squeeze on oil producers' profits. [https://reut.rs/2RTt8II]
Some British politicians have said London should bring the ban forward to 2032, a more ambitious deadline already adopted by Scotland, while Denmark wants to make the move by 2030.
Underlining his green ambitions, Sanchez brought environment and energy together into one ministry, which has since passed measures aimed at reducing electricity prices and favors promoting renewable energy.

Under the current climate change plan, Madrid aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions to at least 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. The European Union as a whole aims to reduce emissions by at least 40 percent by 2030.

In an order late on Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Amy Totenberg urged county election officials to conduct a ""good faith"" or ""independent"" review of ballots cast by voters on a provisional basis in the race between Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican and former Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp.
The race was one of at least a dozen high-profile U.S. contests where the final results remained unclear one week after Americans went to the polls. The midterm congressional election on Nov. 6 produced a divided federal government, with Democrats taking control of the U.S. House of Representatives and President Donald Trump's Republican Party expanding their majority in the U.S. Senate.
Officials in Florida are also recounting the results of contested U.S. Senate and gubernatorial seats. 
""This remedy is necessary and warranted, based on the nature of the evidence in the record, the fundamental importance of the interest of the voters that cannot be remedied after final certification, and the urgency of the situation,"" wrote Totenberg, who is handling the case in Atlanta federal court. 
Officials should ""engage in a good faith review of the eligibility of voters issued provisional ballots"" or ""engage in an independent review"" of voters' information on a rolling basis to avoid delaying final certification, she said.
Kemp had declared victory on election night, even as the Abrams campaign said there were thousands more mail, provisional and absentee ballots still to be tallied.
The Georgia contest came under national scrutiny because of Kemp's role as the state's top election official, a position he held through the Nov. 6 vote. Voting rights groups and prominent Democrats have accused the Republican of using his position to suppress minority votes, an allegation he has strongly denied.
Abrams is vying to be the first black female governor in the United States.
In Florida over the weekend, officials began a machine recount of votes in the race between outgoing Republican Florida Governor Rick Scott and Democratic U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, with another recount under way for the gubernatorial race between Republican Ron DeSantis and Democrat Andrew Gillum.
Florida law mandates recounts in elections where the margin of victory is less than 0.5 percent.
The result of Arizona's closely fought U.S. Senate race emerged on Monday night when U.S. Representative Kyrsten Sinema declared victory and Republican opponent Martha McSally conceded, after multiple media outlets called the closely contested Arizona race for the Democrat.

Sinema will succeed Republican Senator Jeff Flake, a frequent Trump critic, who did not seek reelection.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Deepa Tampi worries a lot about the air her two children breathe. The garment exporter says she believes her 14-year-old daughter Mahika and 12-year-old son Vihaan both became asthmatic because of high levels of pollution in the New Delhi area.
She has banned them from playing outdoors, and has even moved their schools twice in four years so that they can use indoor sports facilities. When there is a toxic haze covering the Indian capital - as has been the case in recent days - she makes sure air purifiers are running at home and in the car, and when the kids do go outside they wear masks.
""Every year, we gasp through the winter months, armed with oral steroids, inhalers and nebulisers,"" she said.
""I have robbed my children of a very simple pleasure in life - being outdoors. Mahika was an athlete and Vihaan loved playing football, but to protect their health, they had to trade these for indoor activities like table tennis and dance.""
The family paediatrician has suggested they leave the Delhi area because of the kids' asthma, Tampi said, and in the past they have even considered emigrating. But a big change like that is not easy when she is running a business and her husband is a partner at a law firm.
(GRAPHIC-A window into Delhi’s deadly pollution, https://tmsnrt.rs/2PiM0Ut)
MEDICAL BILLS
Tampi, who lives in Noida on the outskirts of the city, is in a small minority. She has the knowledge and, more importantly, the money, to reduce the impact of the toxic cocktail of pollution on her kids.
That is not the case for most of New Delhi's population of more than 20 million, many of whom are worried about where the next day's work or the next meal is coming from.
Ravi Shankar Shukla, 35, who is employed as a chauffeur, says his 8-year-old son, who attends a government school in Noida, complains that his eyes smart and his nose gets blocked when pollution sets in, though he never wears a mask.
Rajesh Kumar, 37, who works as a contract employee with a catering firm, said his two children develop a cough from around mid-October, when the pollution levels rise, until the air quality improves in January.
""We run up medical bills during this season,"" said Kumar, who has a 12-year-old son and a 9-year-old daughter. ""The school has given masks, but generally kids don't like wearing them as they feel constricted. Besides, they also fear being ridiculed.""
Doctors say that many thousands of children are becoming victims of respiratory illnesses in Delhi and its suburbs. More than 10 percent of India's schoolchildren suffer from asthma, according to the federal government.
Pollution levels in the city rose to ""severe"" last Thursday, a day after revelers let off fireworks long into the night to mark the Hindu festival of Diwali. Two federal government pollution indexes showed air at ""very poor"" and ""severe"" levels, indicating that prolonged exposure could lead to respiratory illnesses.
North Indian cities, including Delhi, top a list of places with the worst air in the world, the World Health Organization said earlier this year.
""I am aware of paediatricians in my hospital doubling or trebling the number of the kids they are seeing with respiratory diseases,"" said Arvind Kumar, a leading chest surgeon in New Delhi, and the co-founder of the Lung Care Foundation.
The foundation runs Breathe Easy Stay Tough (BEST) clubs in more than 30 schools across Delhi to train students and teachers to build awareness about air pollution, its causes and impact, and to provide tips on how to deal with asthma.
Kumar says he hears from principals that most children have some kind of persistent cough these days.
""Cough is the first symptom of irritation of your breathing tract. When it becomes more severe, then you start developing narrowing, which manifests as breathlessness and then you need a nebuliser,"" Kumar said.
The federal government launched an asthma manual for schools in 11 languages last month after several incidents, including deaths, blamed on a lack of awareness of the illness.
Mala Kapoor, founder and principal of Silver Line Prestige School in Ghaziabad, on the eastern side of Delhi's national capital region, said roughly 10 percent of her students suffered breathing problems during the winter months.
The 3,000-pupil school, established in 1989, jostles for air amidst smoke-spewing small-to-medium-sized factories, new high-rise residential buildings, a busy flyover and a rail track.
Kapoor said occasionally students have to be rushed to a nearby hospital if they are having major breathing problems.

""This is an example of bad planning,"" Kapoor said, noting that the school was built before the factories. ""I didn't land up in the mess, but the mess was created around me.""

1248,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 08:55AM ET</span>",Former death-camp guard tells German court he was never a Nazi,"By Elke Ahlswede
MUENSTER, Germany (Reuters) - A 94-year-old German man accused of assisting in the murder of hundreds of people at a concentration camp during World War Two told a court on Tuesday he had never been a Nazi and he was not indifferent to the suffering of inmates. 
The accused, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was a guard in the SS paramilitary wing of Hitler's Nazis and could face a prison sentence of up to 10 years if convicted.
""I want to say clearly that I am not a Nazi, never was and in the little time that I still have to live, will never be,"" the defendant said in a statement read to the court by his attorney, Andreas Tinkl.
Too frail to read the statement himself, the defendant came to court in a wheelchair and spoke only a few words during the hearing.
Prosecutors argue he facilitated killings between 1942 and 1944, when he served in the Stutthof camp, near what is now the Polish city of Gdansk. About 65,000 people, including many Jews, were murdered or died there, according to the museum's website.
Reading the defendant's statement to the court, the lawyer said the Stutthof inmates were ""in an atrocious state and the conditions were very bad"".
""Even then I was very ashamed,"" he said. ""I would like to make clear that I was not indifferent to the fate of the prisoners. I had problems coming to terms with it,"" he said, acknowledging, however, that he had never expressed criticism.
""I lived in fear that one day the Nazis would turn on me,"" he said through his lawyer, adding he wanted to get away from the camp. After a couple of years he was moved to the front. 
Equipped with earphones and following the proceedings attentively, the defendant responded with a hoarse ""yes"" when asked to confirm that the statement was his.
The trial, likely to be one of the last of its kind, opened last week in the northwestern city of Muenster and is scheduled to continue into next year. 
In recent years, some other former SS camp guards have been convicted but died either before the conviction was legally binding or before they had to go behind bars.
The 2011 conviction of John Demjanjuk, a guard at Sobibor death camp, was the first time no proof of a specific crime was needed to convict a defendant. It led to more prosecutions against lower-ranking individuals in the Nazi death machine.

The suspect in Muenster, who turns 95 next week, is being tried in a youth court because he was under 21 at the time of the suspected crimes. Court sessions have been limited to a maximum of two hours per day because of his physical frailty.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan said recordings related to the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, which Turkey has shared with Western allies, are ""appalling"" and shocked a Saudi intelligence officer who listened to them, Turkish media reported on Tuesday.
Khashoggi, a critic of de facto Saudi ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed in Saudi Arabia's Istanbul consulate on Oct. 2 in a hit which Erdogan says was ordered at the ""highest levels"" of the Saudi government.
Six weeks after Khashoggi's death, Turkey is trying to keep up pressure on Prince Mohammed and has released a stream of evidence that undermined Riyadh's early denials of involvement.
Prine Mohammed won support on Tuesday from U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton, who said he did not think recordings of the killing shared by Turkey implicated the young crown prince.
Erdogan told reporters on his plane returning from a weekend visit to France that he discussed the Saudi journalist's killing with the U.S., French and German leaders there, adding that Turkey had played the recording to at least six countries.
""The recordings are really appalling. Indeed when the Saudi intelligence officer listened to the recordings he was so shocked he said: 'This one must have taken heroin, only someone who takes heroin would do this',"" he added.
Khashoggi's murder has provoked global outrage but little concrete action by major powers against Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter and a strong proponent of U.S. policy to contain Iranian influence across the Middle East.
President Donald Trump has expressed reluctance to punish Saudi Arabia economically, citing its multi-billion-dollar purchases of military equipment and investments in U.S. firms. 
Bolton said he did not think that people who heard the recordings concluded that the crown prince was linked to the killing. ""And certainly that is not the position of the Saudi government,"" he said in Singapore.
Asked again if the audio tape provided by Turkey did not link Prince Mohammed to the killing in any way, Bolton said: ""I haven’t listened to the tape myself but in the assessment of those who have listened to it, that is right.""
Bolton shares with Saudi Arabia a hawkish stance against Riyadh's biggest Middle East rival Iran, and he championed Washington's resumption of sanctions on the Islamic Republic.
ELECTRIC SHOCK DEVICES
The New York Times, in a report confirmed by a Turkish official, said a member of the Saudi team which was sent to Istanbul to kill Khashoggi told one of his superiors after the killing to ""tell your boss"" - which the newspaper said was believed to be a reference to Prince Mohammed. 
The individual was identified as Maher Mutreb, who reports to an aide to the crown prince, Saud al-Qahtani. Mutreb was also quoted as saying words to the effect that ""the deed was done"".
In his comments to reporters, Erdogan said it was clear the killing was planned and that the order came from the top level of Saudi authorities, but that he could not think such a thing of King Salman, for whom he has ""limitless respect"".
""The crown prince says 'I will clarify the matter, I will do what is necessary'. We are waiting patiently,"" Erdogan said, adding that the perpetrators of the killing were among 18 suspects detained in Saudi Arabia.
""It must be revealed who gave them the order to murder.""
Last month two separate intelligence sources told Reuters that Qahtani gave orders over Skype to Khashoggi's killers at the consulate. More recently, a government source familiar with the matter said Qahtani featured prominently throughout the recordings.
Saudi state media said King Salman sacked him and other officials over the killing, and a senior Saudi official said last month that Qahtani had been detained. But four sources based in the Gulf told Reuters this week that he was still at liberty and continued to operate discreetly. 
""He still has the same influence,"" one of the sources said. Qahtani has wielded that influence over the last three years, with his authority growing alongside that of the young prince.
He ran social media for Prince Mohammed, masterminded the arrest of hundreds of Saudi Arabia's elite late last year in a campaign Riyadh said aimed at rooting out corruption, and took a harsh line against neighboring Qatar when Saudi Arabia imposed an economic boycott of the Gulf state in June 2017.
He also supervised the brief detention, humiliation and beating of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri last year.
Turkey's pro-government newspaper Sabah reported on Tuesday that the luggage of the Saudi team that was sent to Istanbul at the time of Khashoggi's killing contained syringes, large scissors, staple guns, walkie-talkies, electric shock devices and a signal jammer.
It published photos of X-rays of bags taken as the Saudis passed through security checks at the airport when they left. Reuters could not immediately verify the Sabah report.

Saudi Arabia initially denied any knowledge or involvement in Khashoggi's killing, but Saudi public prosecutor Saud al-Mojeb later said it was planned in advance. Another Saudi official said Prince Mohammed had no knowledge of the specific operation.

Outside the Bataclan theater, where 90 people were gunned down during a rock concert, the names of those who died were solemnly read out. Dignitaries, including London Mayor Sadiq Khan, stood on the street in silence with heads inclined.
The attacks, which began with suicide blasts outside the Stade de France during a soccer match attended by then President Francois Hollande and continued with several mass shootings and a suicide bombing at cafes and restaurants in the city, were the deadliest in France since World War Two.
As well as the 130 people killed, more than 400 were injured, many of them seriously. Seven attackers, most of whom had French or Belgian citizenship, were killed. Several of them had fought in Syria and all were Islamic State adherents.
Earlier on Tuesday, French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner warned that the threat of terrorist attacks was still high, even if Islamic State has been weakened greatly over the past year or more and driven out of its strongholds in Syria and Iraq. 
""The threat remains elevated even if it has changed,"" he told BFM TV. ""At the same time, our intelligence and our ability to intervene has grown stronger, with extra recruitment and powers given to the DGSI,"" he said, referring to France's domestic security and intelligence agency.

Islamic State claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks, saying they were retaliation for France's participation in airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's top electoral authority said it has found irregularities in the campaign accounts of President-elect Jair Bolsonaro and gave him three days to explain.
In a document published late Monday, the TSE electoral court described possible campaign donations from illegal sources, donations from unidentified donors and lack of information on how campaign funds were spent, among other issues.
It's unclear what effect the TSE allegations may have. Bolsonaro, a far-right congressman who won Brazil's presidential election in an Oct. 28 runoff, is due to take office on Jan. 1.
""Upon carrying out an examination of the statements and documentation provided by the candidate in accordance with electoral law, some inconsistencies were observed,"" wrote TSE analysts.
In October, the leftist Workers Party of Bolsonaro's main opponent, Fernando Haddad, filed an official complaint with electoral courts, asking them to investigation allegations of illicit financing of misleading propaganda.
That came after the newspaper Folha de S.Paulo reported that Bolsonaro supporters had funded mass messaging attacks against Haddad on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Inc's WhatsApp.
Bolsonaro's defense team said that the TSE allegations were not a worry for the president-elect's team.

""There's nothing that worries us, because the replies ... will demonstrate that (none of the allegations) are grave enough for the campaign's filings to be rejected,"" said Karina Kufa, a lawyer for Bolsonaro.

""There is no flight risk,"" the court in Salzburg handling the prosecutors' request said in a statement. 
Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz announced on Friday that the suspected espionage case had been uncovered and handed over to prosecutors. It follows other suspected Russian espionage cases in Europe that have heightened tensions with the West.
The case is embarrassing for Austria, one of the few European Union countries that did not expel any Russian diplomats over the poisoning in Britain of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter. London blames the attack on Moscow, which denies any involvement.
Citing its tradition of neutrality, Austria has sought to maintain good relations with Moscow and has been arguably its closest ally in the EU, hosting Russian President Vladimir Putin twice since the nerve-agent attack on Skripal, angering British and other Western officials.
Prosecutors say they believe the now-retired officer committed crimes including disclosing state secrets from 1992 until the end of September this year. The court said the suspicions were credible but there was no need to hold him until trial.
""The accused is very well socially integrated in Austria, has had a fixed abode in the country since 1987 and has not fled until now, even though he has known of the ongoing investigation against him for two months,"" the court said.
The colonel was arrested on Friday night, a spokesman for the Salzburg prosecutors' office said.
Austria has said the case was brought to its attention by an allied country's intelligence agency. Officials have since said that country was Britain.
The court also rejected prosecutors' argument there was a risk the colonel, whom it did not name, could commit more crimes if he were not detained. As he was retired, it could be assumed he did not have any more secret information to pass on, the court said in its statement.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - In May, Hassan Fada'am traded his military fatigues for a suit when he became one of 45 Shi'ite militiamen elected to Iraq's 329-seat parliament. 
Fada'am trained as a soldier in Iran and fought against Islamic State in Iraq. Now he's a politician as paramilitary groups backed by Iran have doubled their number of seats in Iraq's parliament. The Fatih Alliance bloc that represents them has become the second largest political bloc.
In interviews, eight militiamen who have translated their battlefield success into electoral victories set out how they plan to use this new platform. Six months after the vote, Iraq's new Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi has yet to win parliamentary approval for his government. Yet already one thing is evident, the militia are better placed than ever to influence policies, from domestic security to foreign policy.
Mahdi's predecessor as prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, has said he fears the militiamen will undermine efforts to unify Iraq. Its young democracy is trying to balance the demands of its Sunnis, Kurds and Shi'ites after years of sectarian conflict, and the economy is only beginning to recover from the country's war with Islamic State. Abadi tried, unsuccessfully, to prevent militia leaders from standing in the 2018 election.
""How can a military outfit have a political opinion? This does not happen in any part of the world. It is prohibited,"" he said at the time. The militiamen responded by announcing they would quit their military roles to comply with Iraq's electoral code.
Some in Washington are also worried. Republican senators have introduced a bill that would impose sanctions on two Iranian-backed militias in Iraq, Asaib Ahl al-Haq and Harakat Hezbollah al Nujaba. Sponsors of the Iranian Proxies Terrorist Sanctions Act include Senators David Perdue, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio.
Iran is unperturbed. ""In the meetings we had with our Iraqi brothers, they assured us that Iraq could not be used by America,"" said a former Iranian ambassador in the region, now a senior official in Tehran.
Among Iran's Iraqi allies is the Badr Organization, which won 21 seats at the election. For two decades, Badr's leader Hadi al-Amiri led the fight against Saddam Hussein from exile in Iran. A Badr local commander, Karim Nouri, said communication with Iran was ongoing ""to keep Tehran's rivals – the United States and Saudi Arabia – in check."" He did not elaborate.
Hisham Hashemi, a security adviser to Iraq's government, said he believed that Iran was in touch with Shi'ite politicians ""in order to have a means of applying political pressure, to guarantee their loyalty, to make sure they have an armed force loyal to them. They provide advice on PR, propaganda, marketing, media, speeches, social media.""
INSPIRED BY IRAN, SUSPICIOUS OF AMERICA
When Iraq's top Shi'ite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani urged his fellow Shi'ites to join the fight against Islamic State in 2014, Fada'am was among the tens of thousands of Shi'ites who answered the call. He led the Dawn Brigades, a force of 3,400 fighters. 
After driving Islamic State from the town of Jurf al-Sakhr south of Baghdad, Fada'am lobbied the local government in his province of Hilla to cancel the property rights of Sunnis in the area, saying they were tied to Islamic State. The Hilla provincial council agreed to his request.
Elected in May to represent Hilla in parliament, Fada'am says he now devotes his time to politics, frequently appearing on talk shows broadcast on Shi'ite television channels to drive home his anti-corruption message. Visitors stream into his office in Hilla seeking help. Like many parts of Iraq, Hilla lacks basic services. Roads are potholed. Medical facilities are crumbling. He receives hundreds of requests from young people wanting a job in the civil service.
Across town from his office is a hospital run by his followers. It provides free medical care for militia fighters and members of the public. Patients have access to an orderly, well stocked pharmacy. The rooms are cleaner than most medical facilities in Iraq.
""At the end of the day we must switch to politics to rebuild our country. Rebuilding the country and maintaining its security could come only through good politics,"" said Fada'am.
Another militiaman turned politician, Falih Khazali, fought on the side of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria's civil war and lost an eye defending a Shi'ite shrine near Damascus. These days, he operates from Iraq's second city Basra in the oil-producing south. Posters of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini adorn the wall of his office. He is beginning his second term in parliament, having been elected for the first time in 2014. 
""The Americans should not consider Iraq as one of their villages. Iraq is an independent state with an ancient history. The United states must not deal with Iraq on the basis of zero give and 100 percent take,"" he said.
""Iran's role was very effective in arming Iraqi forces and the Hashid (militia) through the government. Only the Islamic Republic of Iran supported Iraq when the state was about to collapse. All others were onlookers.""
Like Iran, Khazali is opposed to the American military presence in Iraq. He says he is ""pushing for a draft law to force government to reconsider bilateral military cooperation with the United States."" About 5,200 U.S. troops are based in Iraq. They will stay ""as long as needed"" to help stabilize regions previously controlled by Islamic State, said a spokesman for the U.S.-led international coalition.
UNCLEAN WATER, CORRUPT OFFICIALS
Like Fada'am, Khazali is focused on everyday issues that are important to Iraqis: contaminated water, dilapidated infrastructure and corrupt officials. He has opened his office in Basra to anyone who can provide proof of official corruption. He says he has put together a file containing 100 cases. During the first session of parliament in mid-September, Khazali successfully urged the chamber to send a delegation to investigate the ""miserable conditions"" in Basra, the scene of protests over unsafe water, power shortages, unemployment and corruption.
""Fighting corruption is my primary target now after defeating Islamic State,"" he said. ""Corruption is a second Islamic State if not worse.""
That's a view shared by others, including Asaib ahl al-Haq, one of the militias that is faced with possible U.S. sanctions. Asaib militiaman Saad al Husseini, from the town of Kut on the banks of the Tigris river, has taken up a seat in parliament. He handled logistics for Asaib during the war against Islamic State, ensuring fighters showed up at their positions and arranging matters after deaths. He says the protests in Basra flow from the failings of successive governments.
""The protests now are a stark evidence that corruption is spreading in all government institutions. The next step should be fighting corruption,"" he said. ""My primary objective after becoming a lawmaker will be helping to legislate to serve people's interests and monitoring the performance of the government in order to stamp out corruption.""
REVOLUTIONARY GUARD II
Some Iraqi politicians and military officers worry that through the Shi'ite militias Tehran is trying to create an Iraqi version of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, with its parallel security apparatus and vast business empire. Iraqi militias have shares in construction, trade and car import companies. 
At the Safra border crossing, 90 km north of Baghdad, the Badr Organisation, Iran's closest paramilitary partner in Iraq, collects custom tariffs and taxes on goods transported from the Kurdish region in the north, according to a local councillor and two former senior Iraqi officials. The councillor said at least $12 to $15 million goes to the Badr group each month.
Local Badr commander, Imad Jafaar, denied the group was using the crossing to generate funds.
Hard currency exchanges along central Baghdad's busy streets pay fees to militias to protect keep their businesses, said three owners of currency exchange businesses and police sources.

Cash flows do not stop at business interests. The Iraqi state budget allocated $1 billion for the militias during the war with Islamic State. A Hashid fighter is normally paid $600 a month, compared to any army soldier's $200 salary.

1256,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 06:45AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.N. will not help Myanmar with long-term camps for Rohingya - document,"By Poppy McPherson
YANGON (Reuters) - The United Nations' refugee agency will not provide humanitarian assistance to Rohingya Muslims who return to Myanmar if they are interned in camps, according to an internal position paper circulated days before the initial repatriation is due to start.
The confidential briefing paper, dated this month and reviewed by Reuters on Tuesday, outlines the position of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on the repatriation process, and reflects a desire not to be drawn into supporting long-term camps for the Muslim minority.
A UNHCR spokeswoman said it did not comment on leaked documents.
Myanmar and Bangladesh agreed in late October to begin in mid-November the repatriation of some of the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya who fled Myanmar last year to escape an army crackdown, despite warnings by the U.N. and aid agencies that conditions were not yet safe for their return.
Myanmar has been building transit centers for the refugees that it says will be temporary, but many Rohingya say they fear the sites could become permanent because of harsh restrictions on movement imposed on the largely stateless minority.
The UNHCR paper says the agency ""will not provide individual assistance in situations of encampment, including in reception facilities or transit camps, unless they are clearly temporary in nature and used for the sole purpose of facilitating free movement to places of returnees' origin or choice"".
The document, which was circulated to diplomats, also advises other agencies not to assist with any such camps.
Tens of thousands of Rohingya have been languishing in U.N-supported camps and villages across western Myanmar since 2012, when they were driven out of their homes during a previous wave of ethnic violence. They were told the camps, razor-wire ringed areas they are forbidden to leave, would be temporary.
Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay did not answer calls seeking comment on Tuesday.
The U.S. State Department said in a statement on Sunday any returnees to Myanmar ""must have freedom of movement and not be confined to camps"".
NOT READY
More than 700,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh to escape a sweeping army crackdown in the north of Myanmar's Rakhine state last year. U.N-mandated investigators have accused the Myanmar military of ""genocidal intent"" and ethnic cleansing. Myanmar denies almost all of the allegations against its troops, saying security forces were battling terrorists.
In the document, the UNHCR also outlines its involvement in the repatriation process organized by Myanmar and Bangladesh, saying that its officials will seek to ascertain whether several thousand Rohingya on a list of refugees identified for repatriation to Myanmar want to go back.
Last week, more than 20 individuals on the list of potential returnees submitted by Bangladesh told Reuters they would refuse to return, saying they feared for their safety.
More than 1 million Rohingya lived in Rakhine before the exodus of refugees that began in August last year. The state has long been riven with tension between ethnic Rakhine Buddhists and the Rohingya, who are mostly denied citizenship and face severe restrictions on their movement.
The memo seen by Reuters reiterates the UNHCR's stance that conditions in Rakhine are not conducive to returns.
That view was repeated by UNHCR Assistant High Commissioner for Protection Volker Turk on Tuesday.
""I think we are still not at that stage where the conditions are there that we would be able to facilitate or promote returns at this point in time,"" Volker told a news briefing in Geneva.
    ""So if there are indeed people who want to return, we have to absolutely make sure that we are able to certify that they do this on (the basis of) a free and informed choice.""
The UNHCR called in the document for Myanmar to release more information about plans to return and reintegrate the Rohingya.
On Sunday, Myanmar's Minister for Social Welfare Win Myat Aye said preparations had been made for 2,251 people to be transported to two transit centers by boat on Thursday, while a second group of 2,095 could follow later by road.
Once processed, they would be sent to another center where they would be housed and fed until they could be resettled, he said.
Returnees would only be allowed to travel within Maungdaw township if they accepted National Verification Cards, an identity document most Rohingya reject because they say it brands them as foreigners.
Authorities have said they plan to build houses in 42 sites across Rakhine, but have not revealed the locations. 

In its memo, the UNHCR says the organization would provide support to refugees in ""resettlement sites and model villages"" in Rakhine state only if these were ""located in places of refugees' origin or choice"".

1258,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 06:20AM ET</span>",U.S. trial of Mexico's 'El Chapo' begins amid heavy security,"By Brendan Pierson
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The trial of accused Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman will begin with lawyers' opening statements in a federal court in Brooklyn on Tuesday, amid intense public attention and extraordinary security measures.
Federal prosecutors say that as leader of Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel, Guzman, 61, directed massive shipments of heroin, cocaine, marijuana and methamphetamine bound for the United States. He faces 17 criminal counts and a potential life sentence if convicted. 
As well as smuggling drugs to the United States, the Sinaloa Cartel has played a major role in narco violence between rival gangs that has torn areas of Mexico apart and defied successive governments.
More than 200,000 people have been killed -- many in cartel feuds -- since the Mexican government sent troops in to take on the drug gangs in 2006. 
Guzman's lawyers have signaled that they intend to downplay their client's role in the cartel and argue that the prosecutors' witnesses are motivated by self interest and not believable.
Guzman, who twice dramatically escaped from Mexican maximum security prisons, has been kept in solitary confinement in Manhattan and transported to court in Brooklyn in a heavily guarded motorcade. 
The security around him is so strict that U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan, who is presiding over the case, last week denied a motion by Guzman asking to hug his wife before the trial.
The jurors will remain anonymous and be escorted to and from by armed U.S. marshals. Prosecutors have said the security is necessary because of Guzman's history of intimidating and even ordering murders of potential witnesses. Guzman's lawyers have called those claims unfounded.
EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES
Prosecutors have also taken extraordinary measures to protect witnesses they plan to call during the trial, which could last up to four months.
According to court filings, those witnesses will include former Sinaloa Cartel members and others involved in the drug trade who are now cooperating with the U.S. government. None have been publicly named, and some may testify under aliases.
Guzman was one of world's most wanted fugitives until he was captured in January 2016 in his native Sinaloa. He was extradited to the United States a year later. 
In 2009, Forbes Magazine put him on its list of the world’s richest people, with an estimated $1 billion fortune but investigators say it is impossible to know exactly how much he was worth. 
Guzman used his wealth to buy off politicians, police chiefs, soldiers and judges, Mexican prosecutors say. His nickname, a reference to his five foot, six inch (1.67 meters) height, is often translated in English as ""Shorty.""
Several former Guzman associates are known to have struck deals to cooperate with U.S. prosecutors, raising the possibility that they will appear on the witness stand.
They include Vicente Zambada, son of top Sinaloa Cartel figure Ismael Zambada, who pledged to cooperate in a plea agreement made public last week, and Chicago-born twins Pedro and Margarito Flores, one-time drug traffickers who secretly taped Guzman.
The defense will be spearheaded by Eduardo Balarezo and William Purpura, who previously defended Mexican drug lord Alfredo Beltran Leyva, and Jeffrey Lichtman, best known for securing the acquittal of mafia boss John Gotti's son.

Beltran Leyva, once a partner and later a rival of Guzman, was found guilty of U.S. drug charges and sentenced to life in prison by a federal judge in Washington last year.

Asked on the sidelines of a speech he delivered in Singapore to comment on how Myanmar and Suu Kyi had been dealing with the Rohingya issue, Mahathir said:
""It would seem that Aung San Suu Kyi is trying to defend what is indefensible.
""They are actually oppressing these people to the point of killing them, mass killing.""
A U.N. report in August detailed a military crackdown with genocidal intent that began in 2017 and drove hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims from Rakhine state into neighboring Bangladesh. 
Myanmar has denied most of the allegations in the report. Suu Kyi has previously said her civilian government should not bear all responsibility for the crisis because the military retains a powerful political role under the constitution.

Southeast Asian nations will call for those responsible for atrocities in Myanmar's Rakhine state to be held ""fully accountable"", according to a statement prepared for a regional summit, reflecting a stronger line being taken within the group.

1260,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 05:10AM ET</span>",'Treasured sword': North Korea seen as reliant as ever on nuclear arsenal as talks stall,"By Josh Smith
SEOUL (Reuters) - Amid signs that negotiations between North Korea and the U.S. are stalling, analysts say Pyongyang still sees its nuclear arsenal as a key tool in securing its national safety and winning concessions from international rivals.
Just as the United States has doubled down on its sanctions on Pyongyang, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has not retreated from his pledge to expand his operational force of nuclear bombs and ballistic missiles, increasing his leverage under any still-elusive denuclearization deal.
A U.S. think tank said on Monday it had identified at least 13 of an estimated 20 active, undeclared missile bases inside North Korea, underscoring the challenge for American negotiators hoping to persuade Kim to give up his weapons programs.
As time goes by, North Korea's likely expansion of its arsenal could force Washington to rethink its insistence on full denuclearization, said Moon Hong-sik, a research fellow at the Institute for National Security Strategy in Seoul. 
""This is the choice the United States has to make: whether they keep pursuing the ideal of 'complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization,' or take this dilemma into consideration and make a compromise for limited denuclearization,"" he said.
U.S. President Donald Trump met Kim at an unprecedented summit in Singapore in June where they agreed to ""work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
But with scant sign of progress on negotiations since and recent high-level meetings canceled, Trump said last week he's now in ""no rush"" and still wants to meet with Kim for a second time. 
U.S. officials have said sanctions forced North Korea to the negotiating table and vowed to keep pressure until complete denuclearization. But North Korea has credited its nuclear and missile breakthroughs for providing it the standing to meet the world's largest powers.
Kim's own words suggest Pyongyang will continue with production and development of the nuclear program even as it negotiates with Washington on denuclearization, experts say.
""In the 2018 New Year address, Kim Jong Un called for shifting to full-scale production and deployment of nuclear weapons and missiles,"" said Joshua Pollack, a senior research associate at the U.S.-based James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS).
""He's never said or done anything since then to contradict that.""
North Korea has not tested a nuclear bomb or ballistic missile since last year, and has said it has shuttered its main nuclear test site with plans to dismantle several more facilities.
North Korea recently warned, however, it could restart its nuclear program if the United States does not drop its campaign of “maximum pressure” and sanctions. 
""NORTH KOREA NEVER PROMISED""
Monday's report by the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), sparked media coverage calling it a ""great deception"" by the North Koreans.
But South Korea's presidential Blue House said without an actual deal to violate, Pyongyang has broken no promises.
""North Korea has never promised to shut down this missile base,"" Blue House spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom said. ""It has never signed any agreement, any negotiation that makes shutting down missile bases mandatory... the fact that such a missile base exists shows the necessity for negotiations to be achieved quickly."" 
Asked about the report, Trump's national security adviser John Bolton told reporters in Singapore on Tuesday that Trump ""has given North Korea an incredible opportunity to walk through a door to a different future if they denuclearize...but they still need to do that.""
The activity at the missile bases is one of several examples why American officials may be reluctant to lift any sanctions, said Shin Beom-chul, director of the Center for Security and Unification at Seoul's Asan Institute for Policy Studies.
""In short, from the CSIS report we can infer that first, North Korea is not sincere enough with negotiating and second, there’s no change in their nuclear capacity,"" he said.
U.S. officials have discussed possible clandestine enrichment sites for nuclear fuel, and in July, analysts at CNS used commercial satellite imagery to conclude that North Korea was ""completing a major expansion of an important factory for producing solid rocket motors for... nuclear-armed missiles"".
In April, ahead of his meeting with Trump, Kim told a gathering of ruling party leadership the nuclear arsenal represented a ""great victory"" and announced there was no need for further tests of nuclear weapons or ballistic missiles.
In the speech, however, Kim also hinted at nuclear weapons playing an important role long into the future, calling them a ""powerful treasured sword for defending peace"" that would ""reliably guarantee"" a dignified and happy life for generations of North Koreans.

""Note the description of nuclear weapons as the only firm security assurance,"" Pollack said. ""They are not seeking any 'security assurance' other than the indefinite possession of nuclear weapons.""

The king, 82, will meet citizens and launch development projects in northern areas including Waad al-Shamal industrial city, according to a statement carried by state news agency SPA.
Last week, King Salman visited Qassim and Hail provinces, north of the capital Riyadh. He was accompanied for parts of that trip by his favorite son and heir apparent Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
The tours are the latest public outreach by the king, apparently intended to shore up the power of the crown prince, who has taken over day-to-day rule but whose international reputation was battered since Khashoggi was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said the order to kill Khashoggi came from the highest level of the Saudi government, although he did not believe King Salman himself was involved.
After initial denials, Saudi officials acknowledged the killing was planned in advance but said Prince Mohammed had no knowledge of the specific operation.

The 33-year-old crown prince is on course to become the first Saudi monarch from a new generation in 65 years, but his rise has upended the system of rule in place for decades in which successive kings sought family consensus and allocated powerful posts to their brothers and nephews.

BEIJING (Reuters) - No country can block China's cooperation with island nations in the Pacific and the area is no country's sphere of influence, a senior diplomat said on Tuesday, ahead of a summit between President Xi Jinping and Pacific island leaders.
Australia, in particular, has been vying for influence with China in sparsely populated Pacific island countries that control vast swathes of resource-rich oceans.
Australia will offer Pacific countries up to A$3 billion ($2.18 billion) in grants and cheap loans to build infrastructure, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said last week.
Xi is due to meet leaders from eight Pacific nations it has diplomatic ties with at the end of the week in Papua New Guinea, where he will offer ""important measures"" for more cooperation, Vice Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang told a news briefing.
""Other countries should not obstruct China's friendly cooperation and exchanges with the island nations. Of course, they have no way to obstruct this cooperation and these exchanges,"" Zheng said, without specifying any country. 
Meeting in Beijing last week, the Chinese government's top diplomat told his Australian counterpart that Beijing and Canberra should be cooperating in the South Pacific and not be cast as strategic rivals.
Zheng said China was willing to cooperate with other countries in the Pacific, and that everyone should ""positively respond to the special difficulties island nations face and urgent needs"" and help them to achieve sustainable development.
""The island country region is not any country's sphere of influence. Everyone should jointly help the island nations,"" he said. 
""We hope that relevant parties can objectively and positively view China's relations with Pacific Island nations, and earnestly abandon outdated concepts of Cold War thinking and zero-sum games, and do more to benefit the island nations' development and improvement of livelihoods and regional peace and stability.""
China has spent $1.3 billion on concessionary loans and gifts since 2011 to become the Pacific's second-largest donor after Australia, stoking concern in the West that several tiny nations could end up overburdened and in debt to Beijing.
Xi will be meeting the leaders of Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Vanuatu, Samoa, Micronesia, the Cook Islands, Tonga and Niue.
Zheng did not give a date for the summit, only saying meetings would be happening in Port Moresby on Thursday and Friday, ahead of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Papua New Guinea on the weekend.

Six other Pacific island nations have diplomatic relations with Taiwan though, which Beijing regards as a wayward Chinese province with no right to formal foreign ties. Their leaders will not be attending the meeting with Xi.

1264,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 04:08AM ET</span>","China tells world to ignore ""gossip"" about Xinjiang","BEIJING (Reuters) - The world should ignore ""gossip"" about China's Xinjiang region and trust authorities there, the government's top diplomat said on Tuesday, when asked if Beijing would allow international observers to inspect camps holding Muslims there.
Western countries including Canada, France, Germany, and the United States have urged China to shut down camps in Xinjiang, where activists say as many as 1 million members of the Uighur minority and other Muslims are being detained. 
Far western Xinjiang faces a threat from Islamist militants and separatists, China has said in the past. It rejects all accusations of mistreatment and denies mass internment. 
After initial blanket denials, however, Chinese officials have said some people guilty of minor offences were being sent to ""vocational"" training centers, where they are taught work skills and legal knowledge aimed at curbing militancy.
After meeting Heiko Maas, Germany's foreign minister, State Councillor Wang Yi said he hoped people would understand and support the Xinjiang regional government's efforts to fight terrorism, end the spread of extremism and ensure social stability.
""(People) should not listen to gossip or rumor, because the Xinjiang regional government, of course, understands the situation in Xinjiang best, and not some other people or organizations,"" said Wang, who is also foreign minister.
""The efforts are completely in line with the direction the international community has taken to combat terrorism, and are an important part of the global fight against terrorism,"" he told reporters.
""If we can take care of prevention, then it will be impossible for terrorism to spread and take root.""
Wang's remarks followed Monday's comments by Maas that there was a need for more information on the Xinjiang situation and that China needed to be transparent.
""In any case, we cannot accept re-education camps. We need transparency in order to properly judge what is happening there,"" Maas said in Beijing.
Reports of mass detentions and strict surveillance of Uighurs and other Muslims have prompted the United States to consider sanctions against officials and companies linked to suspected human rights abuses. 

Researchers have said spending on security-related construction in Xinjiang tripled in 2017, and that despite the ""vocational training"" campaign, Xinjiang government data shows employment has not markedly improved.

Navalny, Russia's most prominent opposition figure, said border guards had detained him as he tried to pass through passport control at Moscow's Domodedovo airport and told him he could not leave because of a ruling by the Federal Bailiffs Service.
Russians can be barred from leaving the country if they have unpaid fines or debts.
Navalny wrote in his online blog that he was certain he had no such outstanding financial obligations.
A copy of the exit ban given to Navalny by border guards which he published online did not give a detailed reason for his ban or cite a date for the original decision. It was unclear how long the ban remained in force. 
Navalny was trying to fly to Frankfurt en route to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg where judges are due to rule whether his numerous detentions by police in Russia have been politically motivated or not. 

The 42-year-old lawyer sought to challenge Vladimir Putin at a presidential election in March, but was barred from taking part over a past conviction which he says was politically motivated.

""It is our intention to squeeze them very hard. As the British say: 'Squeeze them until the pips squeak'.""

Khashoggi, a critic of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed last month at the kingdom's Istanbul consulate by a team sent from Riyadh. 
The kingdom’s public prosecutor Saud al-Mojeb later said Khashoggi was killed in a premeditated attack, but his body has not been found.

The draft of the chairman's statement, which was reviewed by Reuters but may change before it is delivered by host Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the close of meetings of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), said the situation in Rakhine State was a ""matter of concern"".
The Singapore government did not immediately comment on the draft statement. 
A final statement could be issued after the ASEAN leaders meet late on Tuesday.
Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay did not answer calls seeking comment on the summit message. 
A U.N. report in August detailed mass killings and gang rapes with genocidal intent in a Myanmar military crackdown that began in 2017 and drove hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims from Rakhine into neighboring Bangladesh. It called for its commander-in-chief and five generals to be prosecuted under international law.
Myanmar has denied most of the allegations in the report. 
Myanmar's de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, who will be joining the summit in Singapore, has been widely criticized for her handling of the crisis. 
Amnesty International said on Tuesday it had withdrawn its most prestigious human rights prize from Suu Kyi, accusing her of perpetuating human rights abuses by not speaking out about violence against the Rohingya. 
""We called on the Independent Commission of Enquiry established by the Government of Myanmar to carry out an independent and impartial investigation of the allegations of human rights violations and related issues, and hold those responsible fully accountable,"" said the ASEAN chairman's draft statement.
The Rohingya crisis is one of the biggest man-made disasters involving a member since ASEAN was founded in 1967, and it is one of the thorniest issues yet faced by a group that traditionally works by consensus and is reluctant to get involved in matters deemed internal to its members.
In July, Myanmar established a commission of inquiry to probe allegations of human rights abuses in Rakhine, which includes two local and two international members from Japan and the Philippines.
The draft statement repeated ASEAN's previous calls on the importance of the repatriation of displaced persons to Myanmar, humanitarian relief and reconciliation among communities, but went further in calling for accountability for the alleged atrocities.
The strengthening of rhetoric in the draft was flagged earlier this year by Singapore Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan who said his ASEAN peers had urged Myanmar to give the inquiry commission a full mandate to hold those responsible accountable.
A source close to pre-summit discussions, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Singapore was leaning toward a stronger stance because it is the most internationally engaged member of ASEAN and feels responsibility as summit host to protect its credibility.
It was not clear if all members of the grouping would back the sternest statement to date from ASEAN on the Rakhine issue.
ASEAN's Muslim-majority members - Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei - tend to take the toughest line on the Rohingya question, while Myanmar has close regional allies in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. Under military control in recent years, Thailand has also provided cover for Myanmar.
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, a doyen of the group, has served notice he has lost faith in the Nobel peace laureate because of the Rohingya issue.
""We have made it quite clear we don't really support her any more,"" Mahathir said in an interview with Turkish news channel TRT World just over a month ago. 

""Our policy in ASEAN is non-interference in the internal affairs of the countries, but this is ... grossly unjust,"" he said, referring to the situation in Rakhine.

1270,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 12:29AM ET</span>",At least 42 fatalities tallied in California's deadliest wildfire ever,"By Sharon Bernstein and Noel Randewich
PARADISE, Calif. (Reuters) - Search teams have recovered remains of 42 people killed by a fierce wildfire that largely incinerated the town of Paradise in northern California, marking the greatest loss of life from a wild land blaze in state history, authorities said on Monday.
The latest death toll, up from 29 tallied over the weekend, was announced by Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea at an evening news conference in the nearby city of Chico after authorities found the bodies of 13 more victims of the devastating blaze dubbed the Camp Fire.
The fire already ranked as the most destructive on record in California in terms of property losses, having consumed more than 7,100 homes and other structures since igniting on Thursday in Butte County's Sierra foothills, about 175 miles (280 km) north of San Francisco.
Honea said 228 people were officially listed as missing in the disaster, but added that his office had received requests to check on the wellbeing of more than 1,500 people who had not been heard from by loved ones. Of those cases, 231 individuals had turned up safe, he said.
Authorities made clear, however, that they are bracing for the number of fatalities to climb.
In addition to 13 coroner-led recovery teams working in the fire zone, 150 search-and-recovery personnel were due to arrive on Tuesday, Honea said. 
(GRAPHIC: Deadly California fires: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Plpuui )
The sheriff said he also has requested three portable morgue teams from the U.S. military, a ""disaster mortuary"" crew and an unspecified number of cadaver dog units to assist in the search for human remains. Three groups of forensic anthropologists were also called in to help, he said.
The bulk of the destruction and loss of life occurred in and around the town of Paradise, where flames reduced most of the buildings to ash and rubble on Thursday night, just hours after the blaze erupted. Some 52,000 people remained under evacuation orders, the sheriff said.
The 42 confirmed fatalities marked the highest death toll in history from a single California wildfire, Honea said, far surpassing the previous record of 29 lives lost in 1933 from the Griffith Park blaze in Los Angeles.
Authorities reported two more people perished over the weekend in a separate blaze, dubbed the Woolsey Fire, that has destroyed 435 structures and displaced some 200,000 people in the mountains and foothills near Southern (NYSE:SO) California's Malibu coast, west of Los Angeles.
President Donald Trump, who drew criticism over the weekend for erroneously blaming the fires on ""gross mismanagement"" of forests, approved California Governor Jerry Brown's request for a major disaster declaration on Monday. The measure hastens availability of federal emergency aid to fire-stricken regions of the state.
The fires have spread with an erratic intensity that has strained firefighting resources while catching many residents by surprise.
The bodies of some of the Camp Fire victims were found in burned-out wreckage of vehicles that were overrun by walls of fire as evacuees tried to flee, only to be trapped in deadly knots of traffic gridlock on Thursday night.
""It was very scary,"" Mayor Jody Jones recounted of her family's own harrowing escape from their home as fire raged all around them. 
""It took a long time to get out. There was fire on both sides of the car. You could feel the heat coming in through the car,"" she told CNN. Jones said her family is now living in their mobile home parked in a vacant lot. 
More than 15,000 structures were threatened by the Camp Fire on Monday in an area so thick with smoke that visibility was reduced in some places to less than half a mile. 
HIGH WINDS RETURN
Perilous winds that stoked the fire through drought-parched brush and chaparral abated on Saturday, giving firefighters a chance to gain some ground against the flames. 
High winds returned on Sunday but fell again Monday morning, with crews managing to carve containment lines around 30 percent of the Camp Fire perimeter, an area encompassing 117,000 acres of scorched, smoldering terrain.
The Woolsey Fire has blackened nearly 94,000 acres and was also 30 percent contained as of Monday night, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire).
Winds of up to 40 miles per hour (64 km per hour) were expected to continue in Southern California through Tuesday, heightening the risk of fresh blazes ignited by scattered embers. CalFire said 57,000 structures were still in harm's way from the Woolsey Fire.
Forecasts called for winds to pick up again Monday night in Butte County, though with less force than previous days, National Weather Service meteorologist  Aviva  (LON:AV) Braun told reporters.
Nearly 9,000 firefighters, many from out of state, were battling to suppress the Camp Fire, the Woolsey Fire and a handful of smaller Southern California blazes, backed by squadrons of water-dropping helicopters and airplane tankers.
Some evacuees in Malibu, a seaside community whose residents include a number of Hollywood celebrities, were allowed to return home but were left without power or cellphone service.
California has endured two of the worst wildfire seasons in its history over the past couple of years, a situation experts attribute in large part to prolonged drought across much of the Western United States.

Forty-six people died in a flurry of wind-driven wildfires that swept northern California's wine country in October of last year, destroying some 8,900 homes and other structures. The worst of those blazes, dubbed the Tubbs Fire, was blamed for 22 of the deaths.

1271,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 12:15AM ET</span>",Fewer foreign students coming to United States for second year in row: survey,"By Yeganeh Torbati
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of international students entering U.S. colleges and universities has fallen for the second year in a row, a nonprofit group said on Tuesday, amid efforts by the Trump administration to tighten restrictions on foreigners studying in the United States.
New enrollments for the 2017-18 school year slumped 6.6 percent compared with the previous year, according to an annual survey released by the Institute of International Education. That follows a 3.3 percent decline in new international students tallied in the 2016-17 academic year.
Several factors are driving the decrease. Visa (NYSE:V) and immigration policy changes by the Trump administration have deterred some international students from enrolling, college administrators and immigration analysts said.
A strong dollar has made U.S. college tuition relatively more expensive, Canadian and European universities are competing fiercely for the same students and headlines about mass shootings also may have deterred some students, said Allan Goodman, president of IIE.
""Everything matters from safety, to cost, to perhaps perceptions of visa policy,"" Goodman said. ""We're not hearing that students feel they can't come here. We're hearing that they have choices. We're hearing that there's competition from other countries.""
International students have become an important funding source for American colleges as traditional revenue sources, such as state funding, come under pressure. Most undergraduate foreign students do not qualify for need-based financial aid and must pay close to full tuition and fees to attend U.S. schools.
Similar to previous years, the largest numbers of students came from China, India and South Korea, which together made up 56.1 percent of all international students.
IIE did not track new international student numbers before the 2004-05 school year, but Goodman said the recent declines in new enrollments were comparable to the period after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. The annual survey of foreign-student enrollment is funded by the U.S. State Department.
Some immigration policy experts and college administrators attribute the decline to the Trump administration's drive to restrict immigration and an overall sense of a U.S. political climate that is hostile to immigrants and foreigners.
""It is not a welcoming environment,"" said Doug Rand, a former White House official working on immigration issues during the Obama administration. 
He noted that Trump has moved to restrict the issuance of skilled-worker visas and permanent residency, which many incoming students may apply for in the future. 
""It's an act of willful ignorance to suggest that our immigration policies aren't having a direct impact on foreign student enrollment,"" Rand said.
Caroline Casagrande, a State Department official, said the ""flattening"" in international student enrollments began with the 2015-2016 year, prior to the start of the Trump administration. That year, new enrollments still increased by 2.4 percent compared with the prior year.
""The U.S. Department of State is committed to facilitating the legitimate travel to the United States of individuals who want to study in U.S. academic institutions,"" Casagrande said during a phone call with reporters. ""It's quite frankly unwarranted to say that it is completely the result of a political environment.""
Cary Jensen, assistant vice provost for international advocacy and engagement at the University of Rochester in New York, said international students had been receiving more scrutiny from the U.S. government since the Sept. 11 attacks, but that ""this last year and a half has just taken it to another level.""
Jensen said a major issue facing American universities was the lack of clarity surrounding the Trump administration's policies, in part due to lengthy court battles over policies like Trump's travel ban on people from several Muslim-majority countries.
""That has kind of been the worst part of this, is the uncertainty,"" Jensen said. ""That breeds fear and people tend to overreact.""
The administration is pursuing concrete steps to restrict visa policy regarding international students. Last month, it said it would seek to establish a fixed maximum period of stay for international students. Students currently can stay for an indefinite duration of study, and exchange advocates worry such a change would make it harder to recruit students and limit their flexibility once they are in the country. 
In August, the administration changed the way international and exchange visitors are found to accrue ""unlawful presence,"" a violation that could result in being barred from the country for up to 10 years. Several colleges sued over the change, arguing it would cause the ""banishment of untold numbers of international students and exchange visitors acting in good faith.""

The total number of new international students in the United States in 2017-2018 grew by 1.5 percent to a record high of nearly 1.1 million, but it was the smallest year-over-year increase since 2005. The growth in total enrollment was driven by a nearly 16 percent increase in the number of students opting to remain in the United States after finishing their studies for short-term work known as ""optional practical training.""

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China's Premier Li Keqiang said on Tuesday that Beijing hoped a consultation with Southeast Asian nations on a code of conduct in the disputed South China Sea would be completed in three years, and that such an deal would bolster free trade.
China also hopes to come to an agreement on its ongoing trade dispute with the United States based on mutual respect and trust, Li said at a function in Singapore, adding ""there are no winners in any trade war"". 
China and the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) agreed in August on a working text to continue long drawn-out negotiations over the code of conduct in the South China Sea.
Some ASEAN members and China have overlapping claims to islands in the sea, one of the world's busiest waterways. For years, they have been discussing a pact to prevent an escalation of disputes.
""It is China's hope that the COC (code of conduct) consultation will be finished in three years time so that it will contribute to enduring peace and stability in the South China Sea,"" Li said in a lecture. He is in Singapore to attending annual meetings between ASEAN and its partner nations. 
""China and ASEAN countries will benefit in that process, it will also be conducive to free trade and go on to serve the interests of other parties.""
Last week, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis urged their Chinese counterparts to halt militarisation of the South China Sea, drawing a rebuke from the Chinese for sending U.S. warships close to islands claimed by Beijing.

Li also said he hoped to finalize a major trade pact with 15 other countries called the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in 2019, and that they would announce ""substantive progress"" in negotiations at meetings this week.

Renae Lawrence, 41, was originally sentenced to life in prison for her role in the drug-trafficking syndicate but that sentence was later cut to 20 years and further reduced for good behavior. She is due for release from prison on Nov. 21, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported.
Lawrence's father, Bob, told the ABC his daughter was ""a nervous wreck"" over the level of media attention she would receive when she returned home and that his daughter had already paid ""a very heavy price for her crime"".
Two of the so-called Bali Nine, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, were executed in 2015. Another member of the group, Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen, died of kidney cancer earlier this year.
The other five are all serving life sentences.

In under an hour, a jury found James Gargasoulas, 28, guilty of murdering six people and recklessly injuring a further 27 people after he sped down Bourke Street shopping mall in January of 2017, local media reported. The dead included a baby and a 10-year-old girl.
Police said at the time that the incident was not terror related and that the driver had a ""criminal history"" that included domestic violence charges. He had also been experiencing drug induced delusions.
The incident was one of Australia's worst mass killings, since the 1996 Port Arthur massacre on the southern island state of Tasmania, where 35 people were gunned down.
Gargasoulas' assault occurred just a block from an attack last week when a man set fire to a truck laden with gas cylinders and stabbed one person to death, before being shot by police. He later died in hospital.
Police identified the man responsible for last week's attack as Somali-born Hassan Khalif Shire Ali, 30, and said he was radicalized and inspired by the militant group IS propaganda.
A staunch U.S. ally, Australia has been on alert for terror-related violence after a Sydney cafe siege in 2014. Two hostages were killed during the 17-hour siege by a ""lone wolf"" gunman, inspired by Islamic State militants.
Authorities say Australia has foiled at least a dozen terror plots, including a plan to attack downtown Melbourne at Christmas in 2016.

1275,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2018 09:57PM ET</span>",U.S. think tank says at least 13 undeclared missile bases identified in North Korea,"By Josh Smith
SEOUL (Reuters) - A U.S. think tank said on Monday it had identified at least 13 of an estimated 20 undeclared missile bases inside North Korea, underscoring the challenge for American negotiators hoping to persuade Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons and long-range missiles.
In reports released by the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), researchers said maintenance and minor infrastructure improvements had been observed at some of the sites despite the negotiations.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump pledged to work toward denuclearization at their landmark June summit in Singapore but the agreement was short on specifics and negotiations have made little headway.
Trump said on Twitter shortly after that summit ""there is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea"".
North Korea declared its nuclear force ""complete"" and halted missile and nuclear bomb testing earlier this year but U.S. and South Korean negotiators have yet to elicit from Pyongyang a concrete declaration of the size or scope of the weapons programs, or a promise to stop deploying its existing arsenal.
North Korea has said it closed its Punggye-ri nuclear testing site and the Sohae missile engine test facility. It also raised the possibility of shutting more sites and allowing international inspections if Washington took ""corresponding measures"", of which there has so far been no sign.
A State Department official, asked whether those hidden sites went against the spirit of the summit and whether North Korea must give them up, said Trump had made clear that ""should Chairman Kim follow through on his commitments - including complete denuclearization and the elimination of ballistic missile programs - a much brighter future lies ahead for North Korea and its people"".
'CLOSELY WATCHING'
Kim Eui-kyeom, a spokesman for the presidential Blue House in Seoul, said South Korean and U.S. intelligence officials had been ""closely watching"" the sites using military satellites and that the CSIS report contained ""nothing new"".
He specifically criticized any suggestion that the bases constituted a ""deception"" by the North Koreans, or that there was any agreement that required Pyongyang to declare the existence of the bases.
""North Korea has never promised to shut down this missile base,"" Kim Eui-kyeom said in a statement, citing one base described in detail by the CSIS researchers. ""It has never signed any agreement, any negotiation that makes shutting down missile bases mandatory.""
An official with South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff also told reporters that Seoul is ""familiar"" with the sites identified in the report but declined to confirm whether intelligence had indicated any recent changes at the bases.
North Korea called off a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in New York last week. State media said on Monday the resumption of some small-scale military drills by South Korea and the United States violated a recent agreement aimed at lowering tensions on the Korean peninsula.
The sites identified in the CSIS report are scattered in remote, mountainous areas across North Korea and could be used to house ballistic missiles of various ranges, the largest of which is believed to be capable of striking anywhere in the United States.
""Missile operating bases are not launch facilities,"" the report said. ""While missiles could be launched from within them in an emergency, Korean People's Army operational procedures call for missile launchers to disperse from the bases to pre-surveyed or semi-prepared launch sites for operations.""
None of the missile bases has been acknowledged by North Korea and analysts say an accurate disclosure of nuclear weapons and missile capabilities would be an important part of any denuclearization deal.
Sakkanmol, the site closest to the border with South Korea and its capital, Seoul, appears to be ""active and being reasonably well maintained"", the report found.

""North Korea's decommissioning of the Sohae satellite launch facility, while gaining much media attention, obscures the military threat to U.S. forces and South Korea from this and other undeclared ballistic missile bases,"" it said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's chief cyber security chief said on Tuesday an investigation into the hacking of defense contractor Austal Ltd could take years, rejecting a local media report that his agency had concluded the attack originated from Iran.
Austal said earlier this month hackers had breached its defenses to gain access to ship designs and that some staff email addresses and mobile phone numbers were accessed.
The attack triggered an investigation by the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), the country's top cyber security unit. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported on Tuesday that the ACSC had determined criminals in Iran were behind the attack, but the ACSC rejected the news report.
""Some might have their suspicions but we can't come to the conclusion that it came from any one country,"" Alastair MacGibbon, head of the ACSC, told Reuters.
""It is easy to speculate but attribution can take months, even years.""
While the investigation continues, MacGibbon said the ACSC could yet determine the hack originated from Iran, which has been identified in recent years by Western intelligence services as a major source of cyber attacks.
A spokesman for the Iranian embassy in Canberra told Reuters that the country's government was not behind the attack, though he acknowledged the presence of cyber criminals.
""It may be someone within Iran but it was not our government,"" the spokesman told Reuters.
Austal makes defense vessels for several markets, including the United States. The company said its U.S. business was unaffected by the breach.

Presenting preliminary findings after a week-long visit to Brazil, its first since 1995, the IACHR team pointed to weak protections in Brazil of land and gender rights and to a culture of impunity. 
""We express a profound concern over the current state of human rights in Brazil, and their future,"" the team said in a statement. ""Despite some advances, we found a country that has not been able to face or resolve its historic debts to its citizens.
""Social exclusion, lack of access to justice, fragility of public services are all limiting the conditions of development of the country and the critical situation of access to human rights for the majority of the population,"" it said. 
The statement did not name Bolsonaro, who was elected last month on a wave of anger over graft and rising violence that he and many voters blamed on the leftist Workers Party's long reign in power.
Loved by his supporters as a straight-talker, he is unpopular with many Brazilians for his racist, homophobic and misogynist comments. 
He wants to loosen gun laws, provide police and soldiers with legal protection to attack gangsters, scale back sex and gender education and treat land invaders as ""terrorists.""
The IACHR, the human rights arm of the 35-member Organization of American States, criticized that label for those protesting over land rights.
""Anti-terrorist rules should not be used for the criminalization of the rights to associate and protest,"" its statement said. 
The team said it had meetings with government and local officials, civil society groups, indigenous and LGBT communities, favela dwellers and diplomats with the aim of drawing up a report to be presented in the future. 
Its preliminary findings highlighted threats to the rights of people living in favelas, which have become areas of intense crime and battles with the police, and black women.
""They are murdered by the tens of thousands, without investigation, judgment, sanction or reparation,"" it said. 
Human rights protections in Brazil have been steadily rising over the past decades but budgetary woes have led to setbacks, it said.

The group called for results from the investigation into the killing of Rio lawmaker and human rights activist Marielle Franco in March, and for greater protection for Venezuelan migrants in the north of Brazil.

1279,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2018 06:46PM ET</span>",Thai junta and Thaksin-backed populists face off before 2019 poll,"By Panarat Thepgumpanat and Panu Wongcha-um
BANGKOK (Reuters) - Battle lines are being drawn between Thailand's military government and the populist movement led by ex-premier Thaksin Shinawatra as both sides attempt to outmaneuver the other before a general election due in 2019.
The junta has promised to hold the much-delayed election as early as February, a test of its promise to restore democracy amid widely held concerns that it aims to maintain a grip on power in Southeast Asia's second-biggest economy. 
The race is again expected to pit Thaksin's ""red shirt"" followers against the military and royalist establishment, which seized power in successive coups in 2006 and 2014. Thaksin's camp, which has won every election since 2001, has been unable to assert control over non-elected bodies, particularly the judiciary and the military, prompting bouts of street protests and coups.
In a move widely seen as an attempt to cripple support for Thaksin and his allies, the junta last month ordered the Election Commission to investigate whether he is still controlling the popular Puea Thai Party from exile abroad, and possibly disband it.
""They are afraid of us,"" Puea Thai veteran Watana Muangsook told Reuters, referring to the junta's efforts to undermine the influence of his party and allies. ""The only way they can beat us is that they have to play beyond the rules. If they follow the rules they will lose.""
UNDER PRESSURE
The Shinawatra clan faces pressure elsewhere, too.
Thaksin's son, 38-year-old Panthongtae Shinawatra, was indicted last month for an alleged money-laundering offense dating back to 2004. He pleaded not guilty.
Yingluck Shinawatra, Thaksin's sister and prime minister for nearly three years, fled Thailand last year to avoid conviction in a criminal negligence case she says was politically motivated. The junta has sought her extradition from Britain.
Eight core members of Puea Thai are also facing legal action for allegedly breaching a junta ban on political gatherings of more than five people.
Authorities have confiscated and banned the distribution of thousands of calendars featuring a picture of Thaksin and Yingluck, which were being handed out in several places in northeastern Thailand this month. 
Thaksin said in a rare interview with NHK TV recently ""pro-democracy camps"" could win some 300 of the lower house of parliament's 500 seats in the coming election.
That comment prompted the military government to order an official probe into his links with the party. 
Puea Thai members deny Thaksin's involvement in the running of the party and say they have been ""following the law"". 
As Puea Thai faces the threat of dissolution, at least three back-up parties have been launched - Puea Tham Party, Puea Chart Party, and Thai Raksa Chart Party - all of which have executives who are former members and allies of Puea Thai.
The junta has denied targeting Thaksin and his allies, saying government agencies have been proceeding legally.
""I don't see the singling-out of Thaksin and the Shinawatra family,"" said government spokesman Puttipong Punnakan.
Pro-Thaksin parties say they are further disadvantaged by the new constitution, written by an army-appointed committee, which critics say is designed to prolong the military's influence over politics for years through unelected bodies and other mechanisms.
LEGAL ACTIONS MAY BACKFIRE
Thaksin and his allies, who champion populist policies such as a subsidized rice scheme and basic healthcare, remain immensely popular especially in the rural north and northeastern provinces.
Experts say it is this enduring support that could prove a huge challenge for the junta at the polls. 
""The problem for the authorities who want to dissolve Puea Thai is not the party banner but its durable support bases,"" said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, director of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University.
""If the party is dissolved, its support bases will likely just shift to proxy parties,"" Thitinan said, adding that legal moves against the Thaksin camp could even embolden voters if they see them as unfair political persecution.
The Puea Thai Party remains optimistic of the party's chances in next year's elections despite the pressure it faces.

""If this was a 100-metre race, (the military) started at 80 meters while we started at zero,"" Watana said. ""But if the people rejected the military and dictatorship ... perhaps a landslide victory is still possible.""

Asia Bibi, who spent eight years on death row in Pakistan before being released, is in protective custody because her life is in danger from those who disagree with the acquittal. Bibi's husband, Ashiq Masih, has appealed for help to Britain, Canada, Italy and the United States. (https://reut.rs/2qyeBXk)
""We are in discussions with the Pakistani government,"" Trudeau said in an interview with Agence France Presse in Paris, where he attended a ceremony marking the end of World War One. His comments were confirmed by a spokesman in Ottawa. 
""There is a delicate domestic context that we respect which is why I don't want to say any more about that, but I will remind people Canada is a welcoming country,"" he added. 
While AFP said the discussions were about potentially offering Bibi and her family asylum, this was not confirmed by the spokesman in Ottawa.
Islamists have threatened to escalate protests in Pakistan if Bibi is permitted to leave the country. The government has indicated it will bar her from traveling abroad.
Last week, Canada urged Pakistan to ensure Bibi's well-being and Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said the government was ""extremely engaged in this issue"".
Bibi was convicted of blasphemy in 2010 after neighbors said she made derogatory remarks about Islam when they objected to her drinking water from their glass because she was not Muslim. She is a Protestant and denies committing blasphemy.
Islamists shut down roads in major cities in Pakistan during three days of demonstrations against Bibi's acquittal at the end of last month. 

Bibi's lawyer, Saiful Mulook, fled to the Netherlands earlier this week because of fears for the safety of his family.

Captain Misha'an Hazemawi and eight other people were killed when gunmen stormed Hazemawi's house near the Karma district, some 16 km (10 miles) northeast of Falluja.
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack but two security sources said Islamic State militants were behind it.
A small number of militants are still operating in the area and are capable of launching sporadic attacks, Iraqi security officials say.
The officer was a member of the Tribal Mobilisation Forces, a network of Sunni militias that backed the government in its fight against Islamic State, the security sources said.
Islamic State, which had seized control of much of northern Iraq in 2014, lost most of Anbar province to U.S.-backed Iraqi security forces supported by Sunni tribal fighters in 2016.
Iraq declared victory over Islamic State in December 2017 but security officials say the militants are likely to wage an insurgency after they were dislodged from all the territory they held.
Its fighters have kept up a campaign of kidnap and killing, mainly in the provinces of Kirkuk, Diyala and Salahuddin.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Monday that there were still considerable unresolved issues with the European Union over Brexit as the two sides approached the ""endgame"" in negotiations for departure from the bloc.
May described the negotiations as immensely difficult and said there would not be an agreement at any cost. 
Her compromise plan, which seeks to maintain close trade ties with the EU in the future, faces opposition from Brexiteers, pro-Europeans, the Northern Irish party that props up her government, and even some of her own ministers.
""The negotiations for our departure are now in the endgame,"" May said in a speech at the Guildhall in London's financial district. ""We are working extremely hard, through the night, to make progress on the remaining issues in the Withdrawal Agreement, which are significant.""
With under five months until Britain leaves the EU, talks have stalled over a disagreement on the so-called Northern Irish backstop, an insurance policy to ensure there will be no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland if a future trading relationship is not agreed in time.
May's attempt to unblock the talks by considering an extension to a status-quo transition period beyond the current proposed end date of December 2021 has both angered eurosceptics and EU supporters in her party.
Fears that the proposals would mean keeping Britain inside the EU's customs union indefinitely or that Northern Ireland would have to accept different rules and regulations to the rest of the United Kingdom have focused opposition to May's deal.
Negotiations are continuing this week, but officials are warning unless there is dramatic progress by the end of Wednesday there is unlikely to be a summit this month to approve a Brexit deal. 
Brexit talks with the EU ran through Sunday night until 0245 and resumed on Monday morning. 
Both sides need an agreement to keep trade flowing between the world's biggest trading bloc and the fifth largest national economy. 
NOT AT ANY COST
The prime minister told the audience in her annual speech at the Lord Mayor's banquet that she would not shy away from tough decisions. 
""Both sides want to reach an agreement. But what we are negotiating is immensely difficult,"" May said. ""This will not be an agreement at any cost."" 
May said her first trade mission after Brexit would be to the Asia Pacific region as she wants Britain to strike trade deals with the fastest growing economies outside of Europe. 
In what is traditionally a major foreign policy speech, May also said that Britain was open to better relations with Russia after ties plunged to a post-Cold War low over an attack in England involving a military-grade nerve agent.
The poisonings of Russian double-agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, blamed by Britain on Russian intelligence agents earlier this year, strained ties between the countries.
She said that Britain was ""ready to respond in kind"" if there were signs of increased cooperation from Russia.
A year ago, May used a speech at the same venue to accuse Moscow of military aggression and of meddling in elections, some of her strongest criticism even before the poisoning of the Skripals.

This year, she said that the action taken since - including the largest ever coordinated expulsion of Russian intelligence officers - had ""fundamentally degraded"" Russia's intelligence capability.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council is set to vote on Wednesday to lift a nearly decade-old arms embargo and targeted sanctions on Eritrea, diplomats said, after the country's rapprochement with Ethiopia and thawing of relations with Djibouti.
Diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the 15-member council completed negotiations on Monday and agreed on a British-drafted resolution to remove the sanctions, which were imposed in 2009 after U.N. experts accused Eritrea of supporting armed groups in Somalia. Eritrea has denied the accusations.
A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, China, Russia, Britain or France. Diplomats said Wednesday's vote was likely to be unanimous.
The draft resolution, seen by Reuters, would immediately remove the arms embargo and targeted sanctions - a travel ban and asset freeze - imposed on Eritrea.
It also urges Eritrea and Djibouti to work toward normalizing ties and settling a decade-old border dispute. It asks Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to report back to the council on progress by Feb. 15 and then every six months.
Eritrea and Djibouti agreed in September to work on reconciling. Deadly clashes broke out between the Horn of Africa countries in June 2008 after Djibouti accused Asmara of moving troops across the border.
It came after Ethiopia and Eritrea in July declared an end to their state of war and agreed to open embassies, develop ports and resume flights between the two countries after decades of hostilities.
The Security Council welcomed the renewed ties in a statement at the time, but it stopped short of pledging that it could review sanctions after the United States, China, Britain, France and Ivory Coast raised concerns about linking the development.

GAZA/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Palestinians in Gaza fired scores of rockets, mortar bombs and at least one anti-tank missile into southern Israel on Monday and Israel launched retaliatory air strikes, a day after an Israeli incursion prompted deadly fighting in the enclave.
Three Palestinian gunmen were killed in the air attacks, their factions said. On the Israeli side of the border, a guided missile destroyed a bus, critically wounding a soldier, and shelling struck at least two homes, authorities said.
The flareup cast a new cloud over efforts by Egypt, Qatar and the United Nations to broker a long-term ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the dominant Islamist group in Gaza.
The enemies have fought three wars in the past decade. On Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he hoped to reach an ""arrangement"" to avoid another conflict and ease Israeli-blockaded Gaza's economic hardships.
The United States, whose attempt to seal a wider Israeli-Palestinian peace stalled in 2014, condemned Hamas.
""We stand with Israel as it defends itself against these attacks,"" U.S. envoy Jason Greenblatt tweeted. ""This violence prevents any real help for the people of Gaza.""
In southern Israel, interceptor missiles streaked through the sky and sirens sounded during what the military said were more than 200 rocket and mortar launches from Gaza.
Israeli medics said at least 10 people were hurt. In Gaza, medics said three people were wounded and a university building was damaged.
The frontier had been quiet earlier in the day after a botched Israeli undercover operation in Gaza led to fighting that killed a Hamas commander, six other Palestinian militants and an Israeli colonel.
""In response to yesterday's crime, the joint command of Palestinian factions announce the beginning of bombardment of the enemy's settlements with scores of rockets,"" Hamas said in a statement after funerals were held for the militants.
Late on Sunday, Palestinians fired 17 rockets into Israel in response to the Israeli incursion and air strikes, which Hamas said were intended to cover the retreat of a car used by the Israeli commandos.
There were no reports of injuries or damage in Israel in the incidents on Sunday, but the military said a lieutenant-colonel, identified only as ""M"", had been killed in the raid and another officer wounded. 
Violence has flared regularly along the Israel-Gaza border since Palestinians began protests on March 30 to demand rights to land lost to Israel in the 1948 war of its creation. 
Israeli gunfire has killed more than 220 Palestinians since the start of the demonstrations, which have included breaches of Israel's border fence.
Hamas said that during Sunday's fighting, assailants in a passing vehicle opened fire, killing local commander Nour Baraka, five other members and a Popular Resistance Committees gunman.
In an apparent attempt to defuse tensions, Israel's military spokesman said the special forces had not been dispatched to assassinate Hamas commanders, a tactic that led to wider conflict in the past and which has largely been abandoned.

Israeli media reports suggested the raid was mounted to gather intelligence.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey reacted with fury on Monday after French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said President Tayyip Erdogan was playing a political game over sharing intelligence about the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Le Drian had questioned remarks by Erdogan at the weekend in which he said Turkey gave tapes relating to Khashoggi's killing to the United States, Saudi Arabia, Germany, France and Britain.
Le Drian said he was not aware that France had any tapes. Asked if Erdogan was lying, he said: ""He has a political game to play in these circumstances"".
That prompted a furious response from Ankara, which insisted it had shared evidence with Paris and said Le Drian's comments were unacceptable.
""Our intelligence shared information with them on Oct 24, including the voice recordings,"" Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said. ""It is very impudent for them to accuse our president of playing political games.""
""What's behind the remarks of the French foreign minister? I wonder if they are trying to cover up the murder,"" he added.
The furious Turkish remarks toward France were the most direct public expression yet of a concern in Ankara that Western countries with close commercial relations with Riyadh might soft-pedal their response to the Khashoggi killing.
Seeking to clarify Le Drian's comments, a senior French diplomat later said the minister never commented on intelligence shared between countries and that he was neither confirming or denying French officials having listened to recordings.
""What counts for us is to establish the complete truth ... whatever one may think of the recordings the entire truth can't be based on the Turkish recordings. We are still waiting for elements from the Saudis,"" the diplomat said. 
The dispute between Ankara and Paris may hinge on Erdogan's account that Turkey ""gave"" recordings to the other countries. Turkish officials said instead that France had been allowed to hear a recording, and blamed France for the misunderstanding.
""If there is miscommunication between the French government’s various agencies, it is up to the French authorities – not Turkey — to take care of that problem,"" Erdogan's communications director Fahrettin Altun said.
Khashoggi, a critic of de facto Saudi ruler Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed in Saudi Arabia's Istanbul consulate last month in what Erdogan calls a murder ordered at the ""highest levels"" of the Saudi government. Saudi authorities have acknowledged that the killing was premeditated.
CIA director Gina Haspel heard an audio recording of Khashoggi's death when she visited Istanbul, two sources told Reuters last month. U.S. President Donald Trump and Erdogan have discussed how to respond to the killing.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday Canadian intelligence officers have also listened to recordings of what happened to Khashoggi. 
""We are in discussions with our like-minded allies as to the next steps with regard to Saudi Arabia,"" Trudeau said.

Khashoggi's murder provoked international outrage but so far little concrete action by world powers against Saudi Arabia.

Armed men seized the children, their principal and other adults in Bamenda, a center of the country's troubled English-speaking region where separatists are fighting to form a breakaway republic called Ambazonia.
Most were freed last week, but two boys, the principal and a dormitory warden remained hostage until Monday. 
""I can confirm all the hostages are free,"" said Louis Begne, a regional government spokesman, without providing details on their release. Samuel Fonki, the minister of the Presbyterian Church who negotiated the release, confirmed that everyone had been freed.

ADEN (Reuters) - The Saudi-led coalition resumed air strikes on Yemen's main port city of Hodeidah after a lull on Monday as Western allies pressed Riyadh to end a war that has left the impoverished country on the verge of starvation.
Air strikes against the Iran-aligned Houthis' fortifications were halted for more than 12 hours on Monday and street battles, which had been raging for a week on the outskirts of the Red Sea city, trapping civilians and endangering hospitals, died down, residents said.
Air strikes started again later on several areas in Hodeidah province, residents and aid groups said. The coalition's warplanes bombed the entrance of Hodeidah port two hours before the sunset killing three guards, a witness and Houthi media said.
The short lull coincided with a visit by British foreign minister Jeremy Hunt to Saudi Arabia to press for an end to the nearly four-year war that has killed more than 10,000 people.
Coalition spokesman, Colonel Turki al-Malki, said the offensive on the Houthi-held city was still on.
""The operation is still ongoing. It's not true that there is a ceasefire in Hodeidah,"" Malki told reporters in Riyadh.
The Sunni Muslim coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates has renewed its offensive on Hodeidah, a lifeline for millions of Yemenis, as Washington and London called for a ceasefire amid renewed U.N.-led peace efforts.
Western governments that support the coalition with arms and intelligence have toughened their stance on Yemen after the murder of journalist Jamal Kashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 sparked a global outcry and opened Riyadh to possible sanctions.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves le Drian said there could be no winner in the war and it was time to cut losses. 
""It's a dirty war. The international community needs to say that’s enough. That’s what the U.S. says, we’re saying and the British too,"" he told France 2 television. 
The conflict is seen as a proxy war between Riyadh and arch foe Shi'ite Iran.
CIVILIANS DESPERATE
The U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Yemen, Lise Grande, told BBC radio she welcomed the easing in battles as a positive sign, especially for trapped civilians who are ""absolutely desperate"".
Another U.N. official told Reuters there are some positive signs that the warring parties are moving toward de-escalation as the United Nations tries to resume peace talks that collapsed in September when the Houthis failed to show up.
The fighting has already disrupted services in May 22 hospital in the eastern suburbs and forced medical staff and patients in al-Thawra Hospital, the region's main medical facility, to flee the complex on Sunday.
""Hundreds of medical workers and patients, including a malnourished woman carrying her daughter in a surgical robe and a man still hooked up to a catheter, fled in terror as a series of large explosions rocked a hospital (al-Thawra) in central Hodeidah,"" Amnesty International said, quoting a witness.
Another medical worker who was inside the hospital at the time told Amnesty that hundreds of patients and staff dodged a ""hail of shrapnel"" as they fled in panic. 
International medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said it treated 134 wounded from the fighting in Hodeidah, including 14 women and 24 children since Nov. 1. 
Hodeidah is an entry point for 80 percent of the impoverished country's food imports and relief supplies. The United Nations has warned that any disruption to the port risks triggering a famine.
The coalition intervened in the war in 2015 to restore the internationally recognized government ousted by the Houthis, who control populous areas of Yemen including the capital Sanaa. 
Riyadh and Abu Dhabi say wresting control of Hodeidah, the Houthi's main supply line, would force the group to negotiate. 
The coalition had abandoned an earlier offensive on the city in June without any gains amid international concern about a humanitarian catastrophe to give peace efforts a chance.

YANGON (Reuters) - Amnesty International has withdrawn its most prestigious human rights prize from Aung San Suu Kyi, accusing the Myanmar leader of perpetuating human rights abuses by not speaking out about violence against the Rohingya Muslim minority.
Once hailed as a champion in the fight for democracy, Suu Kyi has been stripped of a series of international honors over a Rohingya exodus that began in August 2017.
More than 700,000 members of the mostly stateless group fled across Myanmar's western border into Bangladesh after the Myanmar military launched a crackdown in response to Rohingya insurgent attacks on the security forces.
U.N.-mandated investigators have accused the military of unleashing a campaign of killings, rape and arson with ""genocidal intent"". 
Suu Kyi's administration rejected the findings as one-sided, and said the military action was engaged in a legitimate counterinsurgency operation.
The international human rights group named Suu Kyi as its 2009 Ambassador of Conscience Award recipient when she was still under house arrest for her opposition to Myanmar's oppressive military junta.
In the eight years since she was released, Suu Kyi led her party to election victory in 2015 and set up a government the following year, but she has to share power with generals and has no oversight over the security forces.
Amnesty International said in a statement on Tuesday she had failed to speak out and had ""shielded the security forces from accountability"" for the violence against the Rohingya, calling it a ""shameful betrayal of the values she once stood for"".
The global advocacy organization's secretary general, Kumi Naidoo, wrote to Suu Kyi on Sunday saying the group was withdrawing the award because it was ""profoundly dismayed that you no longer represent a symbol of hope, courage, and the undying defense of human rights"".
Zaw Htay, the Myanmar government's main spokesman, did not pick up Reuters calls seeking comment on Monday. 
In March, the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum rescinded its top award from Suu Kyi and she has had other honors withdrawn, including the freedom of the cities of Dublin and Oxford, England, over the Rohingya crisis. 
In September, Canada's parliament voted to strip Suu Kyi of her honorary citizenship.
Critics have called for her 1991 Nobel Peace Prize to be withdrawn but the foundation that oversees the award said it would not do so.
Amnesty International also said Suu Kyi had not condemned military abuses in conflicts between the army and ethnic minority guerrillas in northern Myanmar and her government had imposed restrictions on access by humanitarian groups.
Her government had also failed to stop attacks on freedom of speech, it said.

Former  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) manager and businessman Martin Fayulu on Sunday won the nomination to be the single opposition candidate running to succeed President Joseph Kabila, who has been in power since the assassination of his father in 2001. 
Fayulu won the vote against well-known opposition leader Felix Tshisekedi, president of the UDPS, Congo's largest opposition party. He faces Kabila's preferred successor for the ruling party, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, in the Dec. 23 vote. 
The demonstrations against Fayulu's candidacy, in which supporters of Tshisekedi burned tires and branches, hint at the difficulty in uniting a historically splintered opposition behind one candidate. 
""It's the UDPS and the base that decides. We voted for Felix Tshisekedi at the congress as our presidential candidate,"" said Maitre Kalonji, referring to Congo's largest opposition party. ""We are saying that we will not accept this.""
Leading UDPS members echoed the calls of demonstrators. 
""The UDSP rejects with force this nomination,"" Jean-Marc Kabund, the party's general secretary, told protesters. ""We're asking our president to remove his signature."" 
Kabila triggered a political crisis when he refused to step down when his second elected term expired in December 2016, but surprised a lot of Congolese when he ultimately agreed to step aside in August.
That would make December's election, if it goes ahead without incident, the vast Central African country's first peaceful change of power since independence from Belgium in 1960.

Several prominent opposition leaders, including former vice president Jean-Pierre Bemba and millionaire businessman Moise Katumbi, were barred by authorities from running - decisions the opposition accused of being politically motivated.

Iran has kept its stock of low-enriched uranium as well as the level to which it refines uranium within the limits set by the landmark deal, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency report to IAEA member states, obtained by Reuters.
Several of the main items curbed under the deal, designed to lengthen the time Iran would need to build a nuclear bomb if it ever chose to do so, were verified shortly before U.S. sanctions were reimposed on Nov. 5 as a follow-up to Washington's withdrawal from the nuclear accord announced in May.
A senior diplomat, however, later said that there was no sign Iranian behavior had changed since that date.
""There is nothing that indicates that Iranian cooperation or the Iranian attitude has changed since the 5th of November.""
Iran's reserve of low-enriched uranium remained well below the deal's 202.8 kg limit at 149.4 kg, the quarterly report by the Vienna-based IAEA showed. 
Its stock of heavy water - a less sensitive material that can be used as a moderator in nuclear reactors but is still restricted under the deal - was roughly unchanged at 122.8 tonnes. 
Iran continued production but 1.7 tonnes were shipped abroad while 1.5 tonnes were used to make medical compounds, the report said.
The restoration of sanctions is part of a wider effort by U.S. President Donald Trump to force Iran into stricter limits on its nuclear program, and a halt to its development of ballistic missiles as well as to its support for proxy forces in conflicts around the Middle East. 
Iran has said it will stick with the deal, which lifted most international sanctions, but only if the other signatories - three European powers, Russia and China - make good on pledges to preserve its trade benefits. 

Britain, Germany and France have been scrambling to shield companies from the effects of new U.S. sanctions and protect Iranian oil revenues, though many diplomats doubt those efforts will be enough to ultimately save the deal.

Adam Thomas, 22, and Claudia Patatas, 38, were convicted along with Daniel Bogunovic, 27, of being members of the organization, after they shared messages praising Hitler as well as images of them dressed as members of the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan (KKK) and giving Nazi salutes.
Three others had already pleaded guilty to membership of National Action, which was banned by the government after members of the group praised the murder of lawmaker Jo Cox by a Nazi-obsessed loner in 2016.
""After National Action was banned it went underground and changed its name but it did not disappear,"" said Deb Walsh of the Crown Prosecution Service.
""These members continued to believe in its racist neo-Nazi world view, remained in contact on encrypted messaging apps, and organized meetings to keep the group going.""
National Action is the first far-right group to be banned in Britain for decades. Far right parties have grown in much of Europe in the last few years but in Britain they remain on the fringes of political life.
The court in Birmingham heard that Thomas and Patatas had given their baby the middle name ""Adolf"" to express their admiration for the leader of the Third Reich. 
West Midlands Police posted pictures of the pair posing while holding their baby and a swastika flag. Thomas also posed in KKK robes with his son, and with a crossbow.
Local police chief Matt Ward said that the group had gather weapons and researched how to make explosives.
""These individuals were not simply racist fantasists; we now know they were a dangerous, well-structured organization,"" he said.

The polls took place on Sunday in the shadow of a conflict between Ukraine and Russian-backed rebels that has killed more than 10,000 people since 2014 and poisoned relations between the two neighbours. 
The Donetsk region's acting head Denis Pushilin, whose predecessor was killed in an explosion in August, was confirmed as leader with 61 percent of the vote while the acting chief of Luhansk region, Leonid Pasechnik, also won with 68 percent.
Kremlin aide Vladislav Surkov congratulated the winners, according to the separatist press service DAN, though a Kremlin spokesman later said he was not aware any congratulations had been extended.
The United States, European Union member states and Canada condemned the vote as illegal and in violation of a ceasefire agreed in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, in 2015.
""This reaction clearly states that, on the one hand, these elections will not be recognized by anyone. This is a brutal violation of the Minsk agreements,"" Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said. 
""On the other hand, there is a call for the responsibility of the Russian Federation as the organizer of these elections.""
Russia disputed that the elections violated the Minsk accord and instead blamed the Kiev authorities for failing to honour its commitments in the peace process.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he was not aware any congratulations had been sent to the rebels, but added that it was understandable they wanted to hold elections. 
""We are talking about two regions that are completely rejected by the rest of the country and are under an absolute embargo. The Minsk accords are not being implemented by Kiev,"" Peskov told reporters on a conference call in Moscow. 
Pushilin said it was a turning point in the region's history. ""We have proved to the whole world that we can not only fight, not only win on the battlefield, but also build a state based on real democratic principles,"" he said on Sunday.
Moscow-backed rebels seized territory in eastern Ukraine after street protests toppled pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovich in February 2014 and Russia annexed Crimea a month later. 

Ukraine and the West say Russia de facto controls the eastern Donbass region by propping up puppet leaders with troops and heavy weaponry, which Moscow denies.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian investigators said on Monday more training was needed for Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX pilots after discovering the situation believed to have faced the crew of a doomed Lion Air jet was not contained in the aircraft's flight manual.
The comments shed further light on the areas under scrutiny as investigators prepare to publish their preliminary report on Nov. 28 or 29, one month after the Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX dived into the Java Sea, killing all 189 on board.
Until now, public attention has focused mainly on potential maintenance problems including a faulty sensor for the 'angle of attack', a vital piece of data needed to help the aircraft fly at the right angle to the currents of air and prevent a stall.
Now the investigation's focus appears to be expanding to the clarity of U.S.-approved procedures to help pilots prevent the 737 MAX over-reacting to such a data loss, and methods for training them.
Soerjanto Tjahjono, head of Indonesia's transportation safety committee of crash investigators (KNKT), said on Monday that Indonesian regulators would tighten training requirements as a result of the findings of the investigation so far.
""We know, because this incident happened, we know we need additional training,"" he said.
The comments focus attention on the contents of aircraft manuals and a conversion course allowing pilots of the previous generation of Boeing jet, the 737NG, to upgrade to the MAX.
The manual had not covered how to handle a situation like the one that occurred in the crash, Soerjanto told reporters.
Lion Air officials said on Monday that they had followed a training regime approved by both U.S. and European regulators.
The approved training was restricted to three hours of computer-based training and a familiarization flight, Lion Air Training Centre general manager Dibyo Soesilo said during a media tour of the center on Monday.
The Oct. 29 crash was the first accident involving the 737 MAX, an updated version of Boeing's workhorse narrowbody jet that entered service last year. 
CHECKLIST
Information recovered from the jet's flight data recorder last week led the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to issue an emergency airworthiness directive urging airlines to update their flight manuals. 
The directive warned pilots that a computer on the Boeing 737 MAX could lead to the plane being forced to descend sharply for up to 10 seconds even in manual flight, leading to potential difficulties in controlling the plane.
Pilots could stop this automated response by pressing two buttons if the system behaved unexpectedly, but questions have been raised about how well prepared they were for such an automatic reaction and how much time they had to respond.
Boeing did not respond immediately to a request for comment on the training program. 
Last week it said the fix for this type of event - known as a 'runaway stabilizer' - was covered by existing procedures.
Even though this problem was - according to investigators - not covered in the operating manual, pilots did have access to a checklist designed to turn off errant systems when the plane started nosing downwards at the wrong time, said Soejono, a Lion Air instructor who like many Indonesians goes by one name.
Experts say investigators will be examining whether the crew examined this checklist and if so whether they had time to cut off the automated nose-down system while flying at a relatively low altitude of 5,000 feet. Pilots on a previous flight are reported to have overcome a similar sensor problem.
To answer that question fully, investigators may need access to cockpit voice recordings thought to be hidden in the seabed.

A search for the jet's missing cockpit voice recorder is continuing and could provide important information about human factors relating to the crash, Soerjanto said.

The Libyan coast guard, supported by Italy, has stepped up patrols to stop boats with mainly African migrants from leaving Libyan shores for Europe.
A cargo ship bound for Misrata rescued on Thursday around 95 migrants whose boat was about to sink, Rida Essa, a Misrata-based coast guard commander, told Reuters.
He said coast guard vessels had been unable to reach the site of the accident so the cargo ship brought them to Misrata, Libya's biggest port.
""They (migrants) did not want to leave the ship...We tried to negotiate with them and this has lasted for three days,"" he said, adding that two migrants had eventually left.
The U.N. migration agency IOM said it had provided food, water and blankets but the migrants were refusing to leave the ship.
Migrants picked up by the Libyan guard are being brought to detention centers where they face ill-treatment and abuse, the U.N. refugee agency said in a report in September. Libyan officials deny this.
Libya’s western coast is a main departure point for migrants fleeing wars and poverty and hoping for new lives in Europe.
But since last year, smuggling networks inside Libya have been disrupted under an Italy-backed deal with local authorities in a former smuggling hub in western Libya.

It said five others were missing and a search was underway.
The coast guard said it had plucked three people from the sea with the help of local fishing boats after the vessel with the refugees aboard went down off the coast of the western province of Izmir. Two other people swam to shore, it added.
One Iranian and 14 Afghan nationals were on the boat before it sank, the coast guard said, adding that search operations for the five missing people were continuing.
In 2015 Turkey became one of the main launch points for over a million migrants taking the sea route to European Union territory, many fleeing conflict and poverty in the Middle East and Africa.
Turkey drastically curtailed the exodus of migrants in 2016 under a deal with the EU after hundreds died crossing to Greek islands a few miles off the Turkish shore.
Mediterranean arrivals to the bloc, including refugees making the longer and more perilous crossing from North Africa to Italy, totaled 172,301 in 2017, down from 362,753 in 2016 and 1,015,078 in 2015, according to United Nations data.

1298,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2018 09:30AM ET</span>",Syria extends time for post-war property claims under disputed law,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has amended a disputed land law that alarmed refugees and the countries hosting them, giving owners more time to register land claims. 
Law 10, passed in April, gave the Damascus government the right to redevelop urban areas that were damaged by war or that were built without formal approval or property deeds, part of its efforts to move toward reconstruction. 
The law initially gave people only 30 days after an area was officially slated for redevelopment to prove they owned property there and apply for compensation - a time frame that aid groups said would be impossible for almost all refugees to cope with. 
Late on Sunday, Assad issued Law 42, extending this period to a year and adding other amendments including giving claimants more time to appeal verdicts, and letting them do so through the normal courts instead of through a dedicated judicial committee. 
Those whose property is already registered in the government's land registry do not have to prove ownership. 
Local authorities in Syria have not yet announced which areas they want to redevelop under Law 10, so the impact of the measure or how it may affect property owners have not yet been tested.
During Syria's seven years of armed conflict half the pre-war 22 million population have fled their homes, with about five million seeking refuge abroad. 
In the chaos of war, many government buildings have been destroyed along with property records, while refugees and other displaced people have lost identity cards or land deeds, meaning it could take a long time to prove property rights. 
For refugees abroad, getting power of attorney under Syrian law for a friend or relation back in Syria to apply on their behalf takes a minimum of three months, even if they both have all the right documents. 
It also requires security clearance - potentially a problem for people who fled districts that were rebel-controlled before being retaken by government forces. 
Countries hosting refugees voiced concern over Law 10, saying its effect might be to prevent refugees from returning if they were to lose their property in Syria. 
Damascus has recovered control over more than half of Syria, including the country's biggest cities, over the past three years of military advances, and wants to start reconstruction projects. 

Its opponents accuse the government of seeking to use such redevelopment of cities and towns where the uprising against Assad flared to effect demographic change, which it denies.

MIRAVALLE, Colombia (Reuters) - The nine former rebel fighters, who traded their guns, battle fatigues and heavy rucksacks for paddles, helmets and life jackets, launch four rafts laden with visitors into the turbulent Pato River, deep in Colombia's dense Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) jungle.
The former guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) have chosen rafting as their path to reintegration, as the government pushes to make tourism a top engine of the Andean nation's economy.
""During the conflict, this region was rough, there were bullets and bombs all the time. Today, so much has changed - many people come to see the waterfalls, the mountain, the river,"" guide Duberney Moreno, 34, a 13-year veteran of the FARC, said on Friday. 
Nearly 13,000 former combatants and their unarmed sympathizers are participating in a reintegration process agreed as part of a 2016 peace deal to end more than 52 years of war with the government.
Reincorporation is considered fundamental to ensuring former FARC members do not return to the battlefield with smaller rebel group the National Liberation Army (ELN), numerous crime gangs and dissident groups that refused to demobilize.
The conflict in Colombia has killed more than 260,000 people and millions more have been displaced, suffered sexual violence or been maimed by land mines or bombs.
Implementation of the polarizing deal has advanced slowly, but the FARC is now a political party with 10 guaranteed seats in Congress through 2026.
Many former fighters have returned home to reunite with their families, but some 5,000 have remained in 24 demobilization zones like the one on the Pato, turning them into makeshift towns built on Marxist principles.
CERTIFIED RAFTERS
The government has budgeted some $1.6 million to help those in the zones, which are protected by government forces, start some 300 farming, ranching, shoemaking, fishery, woodworking and now tourism projects.
Many ex-combatants, most of whom come from poor, rural backgrounds, have also contributed the money they were given upon demobilization to the projects. 
Moreno and eight other former fighters got 200 hours of guide training and are now certified by the International Rafting Federation. 
The site in Caqueta province cost $20,000 to construct and features hiking trails and lodging. Former fighters cook meals and drive visitors two hours by rutted road from the nearest large town.
""We have to keep supporting these initiatives - they create confidence in the peace process,"" said Jessica Faieta, deputy chief of the United Nations' mission in Colombia, which helps manage reintegration. 
President Ivan Duque, who took office in August, has said tourism could be the country's new economic driver. 
Travel to Colombia has spiked in recent years, as stereotypes about violence are offset by positive media coverage of the country's diverse destinations.
""I want tourism to be Colombia's new oil and for it to be the great invigorator of economic activity,"" Duque said at a recent event.
More than 3.3 million tourists visited Colombia in 2017, a 23.9 percent jump from 2016. Figures from the past two years were more than double rates in 2010 and before, when just 1.4 million people visited.
The government estimates tourism has the potential to generate $6 billion annually and some 300,000 jobs.
Colombia has coastline on both the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean, Amazonian jungle, Andean glaciers and cosmopolitan urban areas, as well as a plethora of adventure sports and wildlife. 
Moreno and his colleagues are optimistic about their future on the river.

""We want peace,"" Moreno said, standing on a beach along the Pato in the suffocating heat. ""We believe a different Colombia is possible.""

1301,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2018 09:01AM ET</span>",Cash runs out in Khartoum as Sudan tries to halt economic crisis,"By Khalid Abdelaziz
KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Many cash machines in the Sudanese capital have run out of banknotes as the government scrambles to prevent economic collapse with a sharp devaluation and emergency austerity measures.
Rising demand for cash due to inflation, lack of trust in the banking system and the central bank's policy of restricting the money supply to protect the Sudanese pound have all contributed to a liquidity crunch that has worsened in the past 10 days pending new banknote deliveries.
The banknote shortage comes one month after authorities let the value of the pound slide from 29 pounds to the dollar to 47.5 pounds and announced measures to tighten spending.
""I move from place to place until I find a money changer with funds because a large number of the cash machines are empty,"" said Ahmed Abdullah, a 42-year-old government employee.
""Why are we suffering like this to get our money?"" 
Sudan has suffered from a lack of foreign currency since losing three-quarters of its output of oil when the south of the country seceded in 2011. The lifting of two decades of U.S. sanctions in October 2017 did not bring a hoped for reprieve.
Rampant inflation, strict withdrawal limits and a currency crisis had already placed Sudan's economy in deep trouble before the latest liquidity crisis.
President Omar al-Bashir, who seized power in a coup in 1989 and whose ruling party has said it would nominate him to run for reelection in 2020, has taken a series of steps to address the economic crisis in recent weeks.
A new central bank governor changed the system for setting the exchange rate and a new prime minister announced a 15-month economic reform plan.
PRICES UP
Though the streets have been quiet after rare nationwide protests triggered by bread prices early this year, further price rises since last month's devaluation have triggered fresh grumbling. 
Spot checks with traders and market vendors showed that over the past month the cost of a kilo of flour has risen 20 percent, beef 30 percent and potatoes 50 percent. Sudan's inflation stood at more than 68 percent in September, one of the world's highest rates. 
At the start of the month the government bolstered flour subsidies to try to contain the impact on bread.
A week ago, the prime minister tweeted that he had met the central bank governor to address the cash machine problem, and was reassured over the supply of banknotes.
But an official at a commercial bank in Khartoum said the central bank was not injecting enough fresh currency, triggering the liquidity crunch and long queues at ATM machines.
Sudan imported one shipment of new banknotes last month, and three further shipments are due to arrive soon, a finance ministry source said, without giving further details.
Even after last month's devaluation the pound is still under pressure and the gap between the official and black market rates has widened. On the black market, a dollar costs 52 pounds in sought-after cash and 58 pounds by check.
""We expect the price of the dollar to continue to rise,"" one black market currency trader told Reuters. ""With the scarcity of foreign currency the practice of dealing at the check price has become widespread.""
The body of banks and exchanges that since last month has fixed the official rate daily strengthened the pound to 46.95 pounds days after the devaluation but soon returned it to 47.5.
""The real exchange rate is the parallel market,"" said University of Khartoum professor Mohammed al-Jak.

""The exchange rate mechanism should be based on supply and demand for it to have a true and realistic price, in line with the economic liberalization.""

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - The Netherlands has temporarily halted visa and passport services in Pakistan, but its foreign ministry on Monday denied that its embassy had closed over security concerns after it gave shelter to the lawyer of a Christian woman in a blasphemy case.
Hard-line Islamists in Pakistan have blocked streets and called for the killing of judges after the Supreme Court on Oct. 31 overturned the conviction of Asia Bibi, a mother of five, who had been on death row for eight years. 
Bibi's lawyer, Saiful Mulook, fled to the Netherlands soon after the verdict, citing death threats.
The Dutch government said on Thursday that it had offered temporary shelter to Mulook.
The Dutch government said in a statement its embassy in Pakistan, which is in a tightly guarded ""diplomatic enclave"", had temporarily halted issuing visas ""due to circumstances beyond our control"".
Pakistani media reported that the embassy had been forced to close because of threats. But the Dutch foreign ministry said reports of the embassy's closure were mistaken.
""The Dutch embassy in Pakistan is open,"" the ministry said.
""I can add that we take the security of the embassy and our employees very seriously. This is also the subject of consultations between the Netherlands and Pakistan,"" an official at the Dutch foreign office said. 
No one answered the telephone at the Dutch embassy after office hours on Monday.
Bibi, 53, was convicted of blasphemy in 2010 over allegations she made derogatory remarks about Islam, which is punishable by death in Pakistan. She always denied having committed blasphemy.
The militant Tehreek-e-Labaik (TLP) party, which has made blasphemy a rallying cry, took to the streets after the Supreme Court ruling and blocked main cities and highways for three days.
The protests ended after the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan struck a deal with the TLP that the state would not block a petition to review Bibi's acquittal in light of sharia Islamic religious law and ensure she wouldn't leave country until that was decided.

Pakistani government officials have said Bibi is in a secure location while the court considers her case.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Social network Twitter has warned two Pakistani rights activists against objectionable content, they said on Monday, a move that signals a continuing push by the south Asian nation to rein in free speech online.
The warnings come a week after Twitter suspended the account of an ultra-right Pakistani cleric who issued threats to the government and judiciary over the acquittal of a Christian woman accused of blasphemy.
""Warnings sent out by Twitter are an example of how online spaces are being regulated and are shrinking for internet users voicing their opinions,"" said Pakistani lawyer and internet activist Nighat Dad.
In recent emails, Twitter told activist Taha Siddiqui it had received complaints his account was in ""violation of Pakistani law"", he said, and it added that further action could be taken, but did not specify what.
""Pakistani authorities ... are pressuring Twitter to take 'legal' steps against me,"" Siddiqui, a correspondent for France 24 television, who fled Pakistan this year, told Reuters.
""Twitter should stop becoming a facilitator of repressive regimes."" 
Twitter's Asia-Pacific representative had no immediate comment when contacted by Reuters.
Pakistan's information minister, Fawwad Chaudhry, told Reuters his office was ""trying to establish close coordination"" with Twitter to curb ""hate speech and death threats"", but did not directly respond to questions on the case of Siddiqui, and another activist who received two warnings, Gul Bukhari.
Bukhari, who was briefly abducted in July from a military cantonment in the eastern city of Lahore, said one of her email warnings from Twitter referred to a tweet that criticized the government's lack of action against a prominent cleric. 
The cleric, Khadim Hussain Rizvi, had his account blocked last week after he threatened the Supreme Court judges who acquitted Asia Bibi and urged their cooks and servants to kill them.
In a reply to Twitter, Bukhari said Rizvi's speeches violated the law because he was inciting violence against state officials. 
""In my tweet I am asking government to take action against him. In which world is that illegal?"" she wrote. 

Siddiqui, who left Pakistan after a failed abduction attempt he blames on the powerful military over his frequent social media criticism, now lives in France and says he believes the complaint to Twitter came from his home country.

1307,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2018 07:43AM ET</span>",Canada has heard Turkish recordings on Khashoggi's killing: Trudeau,"By John Irish
PARIS (Reuters) - Canadian intelligence officers have listened to Turkish recordings of what happened to Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday, adding that he was discussing with allies what next steps should be taken.
Khashoggi, a critic of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed at the kingdom's Istanbul consulate by a team sent from Riyadh. Saudi authorities have acknowledged that the killing was premeditated, but his body has not been found.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said over the weekend that audio recordings of the killing had been given to the U.S., French, German and British governments.
When asked on a visit to Paris whether Canadian intelligence had heard the Turkish recordings, Trudeau said: ""Yes"", although he added that had not heard them personally. 
""Canada's intelligence agencies have been working very closely on this issue with Turkish intelligence and Canada has been fully briefed on what Turkey had to share,"" Trudeau told a news conference. 
He added that he had also spoken to Erdogan about the issue in Paris over the weekend. 
Canada is part of the so-called five eyes intelligence network which shares information along with the United States, Britain, Australia and New Zealand.
Trudeau faces a dilemma as an election approaches over how to clamp down credibly on Riyadh over its human rights record while sparing a $13 billion arms deal with the kingdom.
He is under pressure to freeze the contract for armored vehicles built in Canada by U.S.-based General Dynamics (N:GD), although the deal underpins 3,000 jobs in the small city of London, Ontario. 
Sidestepping a question on whether the recordings could change Ottawa's relationship with Riyadh and have consequences, Trudeau said he was continuing to talk with allies about the investigation and accountability for those behind the murder.
""We are in discussions with our like-minded allies as to the next steps with regard to Saudi Arabia,"" Trudeau said.
Earlier on Monday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Paris was not in possession of recordings related to Khashoggi's killings, apparently contradicting Erdogan's remarks.

""The truth isn't out yet. We want to know the truth, the circumstances of his death and the identity of the culprits. Then we will take the necessary actions,"" Le Drian told France 2 television. ""If the Turkish president has information to give us, he must give it to us. For now, I don't know about it.""

1308,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>",Iranian firms dominate Baghdad expo as Saudis steer clear,"By John Davison
BAGHDAD (Reuters) - While Saudi Arabia courted Iraqi leaders behind closed doors at the weekend, its arch-foe Iran made a more public showing by turning out at the Baghdad International Fair, a shop window for business in Iraq.
An entire hangar was set aside for some of the 60 Iranian firms participating. Vendors of steel, chemical products and carpets greeted prospective Iraqi customers with tea and sweets, exchanging pleasantries in Persian and broken Arabic.
If the region's most bitter rivalry was expected to be on display - last year dozens of Saudi companies also took part - it was an indication of how that is playing out in Iraq. No Saudi firms attended this year.
Riyadh instead focused on high-level meetings, with Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih paying a visit to Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi in Baghdad. The countries pledged to co-operate on oil and energy, while new Iraqi President Barham Salih made Gulf Arab states the destination for his first official trip abroad.
Saudi Arabia and other Arab states have sought to increase their clout in Iraq, and new U.S. sanctions on Iran's oil sector might provide an opportunity. But Iran's influence in areas from politics to trade will be hard to counter.
Riyadh and Tehran's competition for influence in the Middle East has in recent years led to Tehran strengthening its allies in Damascus, Beirut and Baghdad.
In Iraq, Shi'ite militias, some backed by Iran, have been bolstered by their crucial role in defeating Islamic State, and became part of the security forces this year.
Meanwhile, Iran's place as a trade partner was made plain at the annual Baghdad fair, which opened on Saturday. Iran's ambassador attended and its diplomats toured Iranian stalls.
""Iranian materials are very important for Iraq,"" said Khalid al-Wali, an Iraqi businessman eyeing up an Iranian chemicals manufacturer as a potential supplier.
""Products coming from Iran are cheap. It's a big source for raw materials.""
Arash, the chemical company's sales rep who asked for his surname not to be published, said it was the first time the firm had come to Baghdad.
""Iraq is an attractive market to us. It's right next door, and after years of war the country needs cheap supplies,"" he said. ""We've decided to come for the full 10 days of the expo.""
Outside the Iranian hall, a lone stall belonging to a company from the United Arab Emirates sold boilers.
Iraqi trade ministry sources said Saudi firms, which had numbered almost 60 last year, withdrew at the last minute. The amount of Iranian companies almost doubled.
MIXED BLESSING?
Saudi firms had a dedicated hangar in 2017, and Falih attended the opening ceremony, the first Saudi official to make a public speech in Baghdad for decades.
Riyadh's commerce ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Iraq and Saudi began taking steps toward detente in 2015 after 25 years of troubled relations starting with the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq which toppled Saddam Hussein empowered political parties representing Iraq's Shi'ite majority, some close to Iran.
""The Iranian presence isn't hidden in Iraq. It's in various guises - trade, politics, religion,"" Abdullah al-Zaidi, a senior member of Iraq's Hikma movement, told Reuters last month.
""The Saudi presence is much smaller ... the difference being that Iran supported the Iraqi (post-Saddam) government from the beginning.""
After Washington restored sanctions last week, some Iraqis might see risk in importing Iranian products, but that seems unlikely to stop them, especially in border areas.
""Most of our goods are Iranian. We get them from the crossings and they're very cheap. There's little transport cost,"" said Dana Ali, a 56-year-old shopkeeper in the northeast city of Sulaimaniya.
In Baghdad, businessmen saw sanctions as a mixed blessing.
""Our company's not on the sanctions list, but it's made business more difficult in Europe - we had a contract with a British company which canceled recently,"" Hamed Shahinmehr, representing an Iranian petrochemicals company, said.

""That makes Iraq one of our best bets now.""

Sri Lanka has been in political turmoil since Sirisena fired Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe last month and appointed a pro-China former president, Mahinda Rajapaksa, in his place. 
Western countries led by the United States and the European Union had been urging Sirisena to convene parliament and let the legislature determine who should be prime minister.
Sirisena reconvened parliament on Nov. 14, but on Friday, he dissolved it and ordered a general election for Jan. 5.
Foreign Minister Sarath Amunugama called the heads of 43 foreign missions for a meeting on the political situation on Monday but only a handful turned up, the sources said.
The ambassadors of Britain, Netherlands, Norway, France, Australia, South Africa, Italy, and Canada did not attend the meeting while European Union, the United States, and Germany sent representatives, the sources said. 
India, Sir Lanka's nearest neighbor, sent a junior representative.
Western governments are especially concerned that the return to power of wartime nationalist strongman Rajapaksa could endanger halting steps toward national reconciliation.
The government defeated separatist guerrillas from the ethnic Tamil minority in 2009, after more than 25 years of conflict. Rajapaksa has said he wants to end religious and ethnic divisions.
The EU has warned it could withdraw trade concessions if Sri Lanka backs off commitments on rights.
Diplomatic and government sources said at least 20 heads of missions turned up for the meeting including those of China, Cuba, Afghanistan, Turkey, and Pakistan. 
China, which has invested billions of dollars in infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka, has called for non-interference in its affairs. 
At the meeting Foreign Minister Amunugama said all of the decisions that have been taken over recent weeks were in line with the constitution.
""Most countries have stated that they are watching the situation ... Of course there are uncertainties. But there has been no violence,"" he later told reporters.
Japanese officials have said they will halt a $1.4 billion soft loan for a light rail project while the United States is holding off on a $480 million infrastructure grant until the political crisis is resolved and democratic rights are restored. 
Amunugama, however, said no country has said anything about grants, concessions or loans.
Piling on the pressure, Wickremesinghe and his allies petitioned the Supreme Court to cancel the presidential order dissolving parliament without allowing a vote to test his support in the assembly.
""We are at the Supreme Court awaiting consideration of our fundamental rights petition against the unconstitutional action by President Sirisena,"" Harsha de Silva, a Wickremesinghe loyalist said on twitter.
The court later adjourned the hearing until Tuesday.
Sirisena has faced international criticism for plunging the country into crisis at a time when the economy is growing at its weakest pace in 16 years. 

On Monday, the rupee hit a record low of 179.90 to the dollar and its dollar-denominated bonds tumbled.

PALERMO, Italy (Reuters) - The U.N. envoy for Libya hopes another attempt to hold an election will take place by June after he scrapped a December plan, but said Libyans should first use a national conference in early 2019 to decide on the poll's format. 
U.N. Special Envoy Ghassan Salame decided to abandon a plan to hold elections on Dec. 10 after a spike in violence in Libya, which has been gripped by conflict and paralyzed by political deadlock since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. 
Salame was speaking to Reuters before the start of a conference in Palermo organized by Rome with the aim of pushing forward a new U.N. plan. Salame said last week this plan would include an election in the spring, without elaborating. 
At Monday's interview, the envoy said this meant the vote would be held between late March and late June, but that the format of the poll would depend on what was decided at the national conference scheduled for early 2019. 
""We want to ask at the national conference what type of election do you want, parliamentary or presidential, and what kind of law,"" Salame said.
The envoy said the national conference should ""preferably"" take place on Libyan soil. He said surveys had shown that 80 percent of Libyans want elections to end the stalemate between Libya's rival administrations, both of which are backed by armed groups. 
Salame said he hoped the Palermo conference would put pressure on Libya's internationally recognized parliament, the House of Representatives (HOR), which has refused to approve an election law.
""The HOR has been sterile, has produced no law ... I think we need wider representation of the Libyans,"" he said.
Salame also called on the central bank to unify the exchange rate of the dinar to the dollar to prevent armed groups with access to cheap dollars from selling them on the black market at a premium.
Libya had introduced a fee on hard currency transactions which had helped to lower the spread between official and black market rate but a unified rate was needed.

""We applaud the results ... we want this exchange rate to go even lower,"" he said.

The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migrationwas approved in July by all 193 member nations except the United States, which backed out last year. It followed the biggest influx of migrants into Europe since World War Two, many fleeing conflicts in the Middle East and beyond.
However, the right-wing governments of Hungary and Austria have since said they will not sign the final document at a ceremony in Morocco in December over concerns that it will blur the line between legal and illegal migration. Poland, the Czech Republic and now Bulgaria have signaled they may follow suit.
""The position of the Bulgarian government will be not to join the United Nations' global pact on migration,"" the deputy leader of the main ruling center-right GERB party, Tsvetan Tsvetanov, said after a meeting of coalition chiefs.
GERB's anti-migrant junior coalition partner, the United Patriots, is strongly opposed to the U.N. pact, which it says endangers national interests.
The Bulgarian parliament will debate the pact on Wednesday.
The U.N. pact addresses issues such as how to protect people who migrate, how to integrate them into new countries and how to return them to their home countries.
The Swiss diplomat who helped negotiate the pact, Pietro Mona, defended the accord on Monday, saying it helped smaller countries such as Switzerland to better defend their interests.
Speaking in Berlin on Monday, the head of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, appealed for a united EU front on migration and other issues.
""If one or two or three countries leave the United Nations migration pact, then we as the EU can't stand up for our own interests,"" he told a business summit.

Bulgaria, which lies on one of the main migratory routes from the Middle East to western Europe, says it is already taking steps to stop illegal migration and protect the EU's external borders.

GHAZNI/HERAT, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Dozens of elite commandos were among the casualties suffered by Afghan security forces as the Taliban claimed to have taken a district in Ghazni province, stepping up battlefield pressure while seeking a political settlement with the United States.
Officials said about 25 Afghan commandos were killed in central Ghazni, where the Taliban have been battling militia from the mainly Shi'ite Hazara community in the districts of Malistan and Jaghori, a conflict colored by hostility between ethnic Hazaras and Pashtuns.
U.S. forces were providing assistance, including intelligence and close air support, a spokeswoman from U.S. military headquarters in Kabul said.
Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said Malistan had fallen but local security officials said fighting continued close to the district center.
""Fresh troops have been sent to Malistan and Jaghori but the people are also cooperating and have stood up against the insurgents,"" Army General Chief of Staff, Mohammad Sharif Yaftali, told reporters.
Some commandos had been killed or wounded, he added, but gave no details. However security officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the commandos had been rushed in to unfamiliar territory and ambushed by Taliban fighters, many of whom now regularly use night vision equipment.
Afghanistan's highly regarded special forces units have suffered increasingly heavy casualties this year as the Taliban have mounted major assaults on provincial centers including Ghazni city and Farah city in the southwest.
At the same time as the Ghazni fighting on Sunday, about 50 police and soldiers were killed around Farah when Taliban fighters attacked checkposts in the city and nearby districts, regional officials said.
U.S. commanders have said they expect the Taliban to step up military efforts to better their position while they maintain contacts with U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad aimed at opening peace negotiations.
Khalilzad, an Afghan-born former U.S. ambassador to Kabul, met President Ashraf Ghani and other officials at the weekend, in his latest round of meetings following an initial meeting last month with Taliban officials in Qatar.
But Sunday's fighting underscores the pressure on Afghanistan's overstretched security forces, suffering from their highest level of casualties ever, estimates from the NATO-led Resolute Support mission show.
The government no longer releases exact casualty figures but officials say at least 500 men are being killed each month and hundreds more wounded, a tally many consider an underestimate.
SUICIDE ATTACK
The Ghazni fighting prompted demonstrations in Kabul and Ghazni by Hazaras, who have complained bitterly of official neglect after a string of attacks on their mosques and cultural centers. A suicide attack, close to where demonstrators had been gathering in Kabul, killed at least six people.
Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid denied fighters were targeting any particular ethnic group, reflecting concern that the fight in Ghazni was being interpreted as a sectarian issue.
The Taliban are a Sunni Muslim, mainly ethnic Pashtun movement but deny any sectarian agenda. However many Shi'ite Hazaras blame Pashtuns for the attacks against them.
Ghazni, briefly overrun by the Taliban in August, sits on the highway linking Kabul, the capital, to the major southern city of Kandahar. It is also a gateway into the mountainous central provinces of Hazarajat, home mainly to Hazara people.
Late on Sunday, Taliban fighters also attacked Farah city as well as checkpoints in the nearby districts of Khaki Safed and Bala Buluk, said Shah Mahmood Rahimi, deputy head of the Farah Provincial Council.
He said 45 Afghan police were killed in the fighting, along with five soldiers, but the militants had pulled back.

Hunt is due to meet later with the kingdom's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a main proponent of the Saudi military intervention in Yemen. 
The visit comes as Riyadh, already under scrutiny for civilian deaths in Yemen air strikes, is facing global criticism and potential sanctions over Khashoggi's killing inside its Istanbul consulate on Oct. 2.
""The human cost of war in Yemen is incalculable: with millions displaced, famine and disease rife and years of bloodshed, the only solution is now a political decision to set aside arms and pursue peace,"" Hunt said in a statement ahead of the trip.
""So today I am traveling to the Gulf to demand that all sides commit to this process.""
Britain is major arms supplier to Saudi Arabia and opposition politicians and human rights groups have called on the government to cease such sales due to the high civilian death toll in air raids by the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen.
The government has said the arms sales earn Britain billions of pounds and guarantee jobs in the industry, and its response to the Khashoggi killing must bear this in mind.
After arriving, Hunt discussed bilateral relations and regional events with King Salman in a meeting attended by Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir and Britain's ambassadors to Saudi Arabia and Yemen, state news agency SPA reported.
The foreign ministry said he would also meet Crown Prince Mohammed, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Yemeni Vice President Ali Mohsen and Foreign Minister Khaled Al Yamani. 
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan says Khashoggi's murder was ordered at the highest levels of the Saudi government. After initial denials, Saudi officials acknowledged it was planned in advance but said Crown Prince Mohammed had no knowledge of the specific operation.
The killing has provoked little concrete action by world powers against Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter and a supporter of Washington's plans to contain Iranian influence across the Middle East.
Britain has called for a ""credible"" investigation and has pushed for new action at the United Nations Security Council to try to end hostilities in Yemen and find a political solution to the war there.
Hunt, the first British minister to visit Saudi Arabia since Khashoggi's murder, will also call on the authorities to do more to provide accountability for his family.
""The international community remain united in horror and outrage at the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi one month ago. It is clearly unacceptable that the full circumstances behind his murder still remain unclear,"" he said.
""We encourage the Saudi authorities to cooperate fully with the Turkish investigation into his death, so that we deliver justice for his family and the watching world.""
Erdogan said on Saturday that Turkey had given recordings related to the killing to countries including Britain.

Six people were killed in the explosion, said Najib Danish, a spokesman for the interior ministry. Ten policemen and civilians, including women, were injured in the blast. 
The attacker on foot detonated his suicide vest close to the checkpoint near a school in central Kabul, which is in the same area as the finance and justice ministries and close to the presidential palace. 
Police spokesman Basir Mujahid said he was about 20 m (66 ft) away from the blast, near where a demonstration had broken up some 30 minutes before.
""I took four bodies away but there were more on the ground,"" he said, without giving further details.
The attack came as hundreds of demonstrators gathered in Kabul to protest against the government's failure to prevent attacks by Taliban militants in two provinces. 

Afghan security forces suffered scores of casualties in heavy fighting at the weekend with Taliban militants in the provinces of Ghazni and Herat, officials have said.

1317,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2018 05:00AM ET</span>",Co-author defends U.N. migration pact as opposition swells,"ZURICH (Reuters) - The Swiss diplomat who helped negotiate a United Nations migration pact has defended the accord against mounting criticism, saying it helps small countries like Switzerland defend their interests.
The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration was instigated after the migration crisis in Europe in 2015, which saw the biggest influx of refugees and migrants since World War Two. The crisis strained resources and triggered fear of foreigners and nationalist tensions.
It was approved in July by all 193 member nations except the United States, which backed out last year.
The comments from Pietro Mona, Swiss ambassador in charge of development and migration policy, come amid growing opposition to the accord, with Hungary's right-wing government saying it will not sign the final document at a ceremony in Morocco in December. 
Austria pulled out too last month, and the prime ministers of Poland and the Czech Republic have cast doubt on their countries' joining.
Mona said Swiss negotiators deserved credit for having the pact become the first international document to set out states' obligation to cooperate in taking back citizens.
""The migration pact gives us an additional instrument that helps us negotiate repatriation agreements, for instance with countries like Eritrea,"" he said in an interview with the Blick tabloid, published on Monday.
After some hesitation, the Swiss government said last month it would sign the compact while clarifying its position on detaining minors from the age of 15 pending deportation, which Swiss law allows but the non-binding U.N. pact discourages.
Since then, committees in both houses of parliament have called for delaying the Swiss signature and giving parliament -- and perhaps voters in a referendum -- the chance to decide the matter.
Some politicians, especially from the right, complain that the pact could blur the line between legal and illegal migration and undermine countries' sovereignty.
U.N. Special Representative for International Migration Louise Arbour has called moves to shun the accord regrettable and mistaken and said the compact simply aimed to improve the management of cross-border movements of people.
The U.N. pact addresses issues such as how to protect people who migrate, how to integrate them into new countries and how to return them to their home countries. 
The United Nations has hailed it as a historic and comprehensive pact that could serve as a basis for future policies.

PARADISE, Calif. (Reuters) - The death toll from wildfires raging in California rose to 31 on Sunday after six more people were found killed in what was poised to become the deadliest wildfire in state history.
Officials said the bodies of five people were found in burned-out homes and the sixth was found in a vehicle in northern California's Camp Fire, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea told reporters on Sunday evening.
Some 228 people are still unaccounted for, Honea said, while another 137 people have been located after friends or relatives reported being unable to contact them.
The so-called Camp Fire in the northern part of the state has claimed at least 29 lives since it broke out on Thursday. Hundreds of miles to the south, at least two people have died in the Woolsey Fire threatening the wealthy beach community of Malibu, near Los Angeles. 
Looting was reported in the southern fire area and arrests were made, police reported. 
Hot dry winds expected to blow until Tuesday whipped up the flames and heightened the urgency of evacuation orders, officials said. It has been more than 210 days since the area received half an inch or more of rain, making it easy for spot fires to spread to fresh patches of tinder-dry vegetation, fire officials said on Sunday.
""We are entering a new normal,"" said Ventura County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen, noting at a news conference that California's fires in 2018 grow far more quickly than they did even 10 years ago.
""The rate of spread is exponentially more than it used to be,"" he said. 
Several officials urged residents to heed evacuation orders, noting they themselves had followed orders to leave their homes for safety.
""Winds are already blowing,"" Chief Daryl Osby of the Los Angeles County Fire Department said. ""They are going to blow for the next three days. Your house can be rebuilt but you can't bring your life back.""
Crews pushed forward to achieve 25 percent containment of the Camp Fire in northern California, which had burned 111,000 acres (45,000 hectares) at the edge of the Plumas National Forest, according to Cal Fire's website. 
In Southern (NYSE:SO) California, where the Woolsey Fire scorched at least 83,275 acres, the blaze was only 10 percent contained. 
The Camp Fire burned down more than 6,700 homes and businesses in Paradise, more structures than any other California wildfire on record.
Its death toll now equals that of the Griffith Park Fire in 1933, the deadliest wildfire on record in California.
Several of the bodies discovered earlier this week were found in or near burned out cars, police have said. The flames descended on Paradise so fast that many people were forced to abandon their vehicles and run for their lives down the only road through the mountain town. 
Winds of up to 40 miles per hour (64 km per hour) were forecast to blow in the north and gusts of up to 70 mph (113 kph), the so-called Santa Ana ""devil wind,"" were expected in Southern California. 
The Woolsey Fire doubled in size from Friday night into Sunday, threatening thousands of homes after triggering mandatory evacuation orders for a quarter million people in the upscale Malibu beach colony as well as other communities in Los Angeles and Ventura counties. 
Many celebrities live in the area. Despite earlier news reports, including by Reuters, that the fire had destroyed the home of Caitlyn Jenner, the transgender advocate and former athlete, her publicist said on Sunday that it had survived.
The entire nearby city of Calabasas, home to more than 20,000 people, was placed under a mandatory evacuation order by city officials on Sunday evening. 
Governor Jerry Brown asked U.S. President Donald Trump to declare a major disaster to bolster the emergency response and help residents recover.
Trump, on a trip to France, said in a Twitter post early Sunday: ""With proper Forest Management, we can stop the devastation constantly going on in California. Get Smart!""
The Republican president has previously blamed California officials for fires and threatened to withhold funding, saying the state should do more to remove rotten trees and other debris that fuel blazes.

State officials have blamed climate change and said many of the burn areas have been in federally managed lands.

The awkward alliance has been marred by disputes about immigration and the fate of the domestic spy chief since it took office in March, coming close to collapse twice. Voters punished both Merkel's conservatives and the SPD in two recent regional elections.
SPD youth wing leader Kevin Kuehnert, who campaigned against the conservative-SPD tie-up from the outset, said the SPD would be closely watching what happens when Merkel steps down as leader of her Christian Democrats (CDU) in December.
""Next year is full of (regional) elections and political developments that will have a big impact,"" Kuehnert told Deutschlandfunk radio.
""I can hardly imagine us sticking together for the year. We have to use our time to prepare for the 'D-Day' of snap elections.""
Kuehnert said he hardly knew anyone who believed the coalition would survive to the end of this parliament in 2021.
SPD leader Andrea Nahles has said that the SPD leadership, under pressure from a restive membership over flagging polls and disastrous regional election showings, did not discuss quitting the coalition at a meeting last Monday.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, the leader of Merkel's Bavarian allies and a critic of her liberal asylum policies, told members of his Christian Social Union (CSU) that he wants to resign as party chief, party sources told Reuters on Sunday.
Seehofer has been a thorn in Merkel's side for much of the past three years, taking a hard line on immigration.

Senior CSU member Manfred Weber told the newspaper Bild that Seehofer had said on Sunday that 2019 would be a year of renewal and the CSU leader would announce further details this week.

Italian officials were scrambling at the weekend to secure Haftar's attendance at the conference organized by Rome. If he shows up, it will be his first meeting with the Tripoli-based Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj since a Paris summit in May, analysts said.
""I expect him (Haftar) to be present since there is no doubt that he is one of the decisive players of the stabilization of his country,"" Conte said in an interview with Italian daily La Stampa.
Conte also dismissed rivalry with France on how to handle the Libyan conflict, which has raged in the oil producer since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's resumption of small-scale military drills with the United States violated a recent agreement aimed at lowering tensions on the Korean peninsula, North Korean state media said on Monday. 
About 500 United States and South Korean marines began military drills last week that were among joint exercises indefinitely suspended in June as Seoul and Washington focused on engaging with North Korea.
The Korean Marine Exchange Program (KMEP) violated a Sept. 19 agreement signed by North and South Korea that called for a halt to ""all hostile acts,"" said the Rodong Sinmun, North Korea's official party newspaper.
The joint two-week drills are ""directly against the inter-Korean military agreement that promised to eliminate practical threats of war and fundamental hostile relations from the Korean peninsula,"" the newspaper said.
A spokesman for South Korea's defense ministry on Monday rejected the North's criticism, saying they are defensive exercises involving small units under the size of a battalion.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump pledged to work toward denuclearization at their landmark June summit in Singapore, where Trump promised to end joint, U.S. South Korea military exercises.
But the agreement was short on specifics and negotiations have made little headway.
Last week North Korea called off a planned meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in New York ""because they weren't ready,"" U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Friday.
North Korean media mentioned the canceled meeting for the first time on Saturday, when the Chosun Sinbo website reported that the talks could still be productive. But it repeated North Korean warnings that the country could restart its nuclear weapons development if the U.S. does not make more concessions.
The biggest combat-readiness war game ever staged in and around Japan also went ahead last week, with the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan joining Japanese destroyers and a Canadian warship in the ocean off Japan -- another key player in the effort to pressure North Korea.

""It's an anachronistic military move to openly hold war drills aimed at others while the United States naval forces residing in Japan are also participating,"" Rodong Sinmun said.

Last month, South Korea's top court ruled that Nippon Steel must pay four steel workers 100 million won ($87,700) each for their forced labor during the war, a decision Japan has denounced as ""unthinkable.""
The South Korean lawyers sought a meeting with Nippon Steel representatives at the company's Tokyo headquarters on Monday, but were turned away at the entrance.
""We got an answer from them. However, it was not from the company itself, but from a contract security guard,"" lawyer Lim Jae Sung told reporters.
A Nippon Steel spokeswoman said its security officers spoke to the group at the visitors' entrance and told them the company's position had not changed.
The company has said that it regretted the court ruling and repeated the Japanese government's position that the issue had been resolved in a 1965 treaty.
The binding court verdict is straining ties between the neighbors and could affect their joint efforts to rein in North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, analysts say.
""We started this lawsuit with four plaintiffs but three of them passed away and only one is alive. He has been waiting for so long,"" lawyer Kim Se Eun told reporters.
""We are hoping the Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp will fulfills their obligation in accordance with the court's decision,"" she added.

Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a press briefing on Monday the government was in close contact with firms affected by the case and other similar suits. He said Japan was waiting for Seoul to take steps to redress what Tokyo sees as a violation of international law.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India began on Monday the first of five state elections to be held in coming weeks, important tests for Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he plots a course that he hopes will ensure him victory in a general election due by May.
Voters in the central state of Chhattisgarh went to the polls on Monday to elect representatives for 18 of the state assembly's 90 seats in a staggered poll complicated by logistical problems and left-wing guerrillas.
The state of about 26 million people has been ruled by Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) since 2003, and he will be hoping to hold on to power.
""Some unholy people have handed guns to children who should have pens in their hands,"" Modi told a rally in the state on Friday, referring to the rag-tag guerrillas battling government forces from forest hideouts.
""They've finished the lives of our tribal children.""
Hundreds of election workers had to be flown in to remote polling stations by helicopter because of the danger posed by the rebels.
Modi called for voters to back his BJP and its vision of ""development for all"". 
The final phase of voting in Chhattisgarh, which is known for its coal, iron ore and bauxite reserves, will be on Nov. 20.
The BJP was the preference of about 43 percent of voters in Chhattisgarh, 7 percentage points ahead of the main opposition Congress, according to a survey http://www.lokniti.org/media/upload_files/Lokniti-CSDS-ABP%20News%20Pre%20Poll%202018%20Report.pdf released last week by the Lokniti-Centre for the Study of Developing Societies.
Modi's other big tests will be in the neighboring central state of Madhya Pradesh, where the BJP is slightly ahead of Congress, according to polls, and in the northwestern state of Rajasthan, where Congress is expected to emerge victorious.
A good performance by the BJP in the elections would help it deflect growing criticism over unemployment and a crisis in the countryside over falling farm prices and wages.
Elections will also be held for assemblies in Telangana in the south and Mizoram in the northeast.
The BJP has sent top leaders to campaign in Chhattisgarh, including Yogi Adityanath, a firebrand Hindu priest and the BJP chief minister in Uttar Pradesh state.
Adityanath has been appealing to the BJP's Hindu-nationalist base and on Sunday accused the opposition of blocking construction of a temple for Hindu god Ram on a disputed site in Uttar Pradesh.

The destruction of a mosque on the site by a Hindu mob in 1992 sparked deadly riots across the country.

SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - At least 12 Chinese labor activists have gone missing in recent days, in what sources close to them believe was a coordinated effort by authorities to silence the vocal group, most of them university students or recent graduates.
Authorities took away at least nine activists in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen late on Friday, and three more activists were taken away on Sunday in the city of Wuhan, the sources said.
The Ministry of Public Security, which oversees police forces across the country, did not respond to a faxed request for comment.
The detentions appear to be the latest action by the authorities against a small but growing movement driven by students and graduates of some top universities who have said they are motivated by the principles of Marxism.
The ruling Communist Party, which espouses Marxism as one of its leading ideologies, opposes any form of activism or organization that has the potential to slip beyond its control.
At least five graduates of Peking University, one of the country's top universities, were among those picked up on Friday, student activists said.
Last month, Cornell University in the United States ceased cooperation in two exchange programs with Renmin University, another prominent institution in Beijing, after students there were punished for supporting labor rights.
The young activists attracted attention from authorities in August when about 50 students from across China converged in the south to support factory workers at Jasic International, a welding machinery firm, seeking to form a union.
Later that month, police in riot gear stormed an apartment in the city of Huizhou where the students were staying, detaining some of them.
""I think the authorities have decided now is the right time to settle the score,"" one student activist at a university in Beijing said.
""The authorities want to shut down the Jasic Workers Support Group in one fell swoop. Why else would they suddenly conduct raids of such a large scale and arrest so many people at once?"" the student added, speaking on condition of anonymity.
'THAT'S HIM!'
On Friday, unidentified men grabbed Zhang Shengye, a recent Peking University graduate, on the university's campus at around 10:30 p.m. and bundled him into a car, according to a witness and screenshots of posts, apparently written by students, on the university's internal messaging board. The posts were later deleted.
A video circulated on social media by a Peking University student who said he was at the scene and who described what happened to Zhang.
""I heard one of them yell 'that's him, shove him into the car', and then I saw three to five people grab a student and bundle him into a car,"" the student says in the video.
He said he and other students who were nearby were pushed to the ground and prevented from leaving until they deleted any photos or videos of the scene.
Reuters could not independently verify the authenticity of the video, which showed no pictures of Zhang's suspected detention.
A Peking University spokesman confirmed that someone had been detained but said the incident did not involve teachers or students.
""Public security organs in accordance with law seized non-campus affiliated persons suspected of committing a crime,"" the spokesman said.
Zhang had been in southern China in August to protest against the treatment of the Jasic factory workers and had been involved in a wide range of social issues on campus.
""We aren't solely focused on one particular issue. We're interested in improving society in all kinds of ways, whether it is improving the lives of factory workers, fighting for gender equality or advocating for environmental sustainability,"" Zhang told Reuters on Aug. 23 in a crowded apartment in a village that primarily houses migrant workers in Huizhou.

YANGON/COX'S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Myanmar officials said on Sunday the country was ready to receive more than 2,000 Rohingya Muslims sheltering in Bangladesh on Nov. 15, the first group from 5,000 people to be moved under a deal between the neighbors struck last month.
But more than 20 individuals on a list of potential returnees submitted by Bangladesh have told Reuters they will refuse to go back to northern Rakhine state from where they fled. Bangladesh has said it will not force anyone to do so.
The United Nations also says conditions are not yet safe for their return, in part because Myanmar Buddhists have been protesting against the repatriation. The U.N.'s refugee agency said late on Sunday that Rohingya refugees should be allowed to go and see the conditions in Myanmar before they decide to go back. 
""It depends on the other country, whether this will actually happen or not,"" Win Myat Aye, Myanmar's Minister for Social Welfare and Resettlement, told a news conference in the commercial capital of Yangon on Sunday, referring to Bangladesh.
""But we must be ready from our side. We have done that.""
Abul Kalam, Bangladesh Relief and Repatriation Commissioner, said he was hopeful the process could begin on Thursday.
""The return will be voluntary. Nobody will be forced to go back,"" he told Reuters.
The countries agreed on mid-November for the start of repatriating some of more than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims who fled a sweeping army crackdown in Myanmar last year.
They say soldiers and local Buddhists massacred families, burned hundreds of villages, and carried out gang-rapes. U.N-mandated investigators have accused the army of ""genocidal intent"" and ethnic cleansing.
Myanmar denies almost all of the allegations, saying security forces were battling terrorists. Attacks by Rohingya insurgents calling themselves the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army preceded the crackdown.
Myanmar does acknowledge the killing of 10 Rohingya by security forces in Inn Dinn village. Reuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were sentenced to seven years in prison earlier this year for allegedly breaking the country's Official Secrets Act after reporting on the massacre.
Reuters says the court's ruling was wrong and lawyers for the two have appealed against their conviction.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees called for Myanmar to allow Rohingya refugees to visit their places of origin or resettlement sites to make their own ""independent assessment of whether they feel they can return there in safety and dignity"".
""Myanmar authorities should allow these refugees to undertake such go-and-see visits without prejudice to their right to return at a later date,"" the agency said in the statement late on Sunday.
Win Myat Aye said preparations had been made for 2,251 people to be transported to two transit centers by boat on Thursday, while a second group of 2,095 could follow later by road.
Once processed by the authorities, they would be sent to another center where they would be housed, fed, and asked to build homes through cash-for-work schemes.
Returnees would only be allowed to travel within Maungdaw township, one of the three they fled, and only if they accepted National Verification Cards, an identity document most Rohingya reject because they say it brands them as foreigners.

Many Rohingya, the majority of whom have been left stateless after decades of persecution, oppose going back without guarantees of citizenship and freedom of movement.

The latest stand-off with its traditional union support base comes just over a year after Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's Labour Party formed a coalition government, promising to pour money into social services and rein in economic inequality, which has increased despite years of strong growth.
Ardern boasts a glowing international profile and historically high personal popularity but has spent much of her term navigating labor disputes and plummeting business confidence.
About 30,000 teachers around New Zealand would strike throughout the week, forcing hundreds of thousands of children out of school.
""My plea would be for the teachers to consider the offer we put. We've put everything we've got on the table,"" Ardern told reporters. ""We hope they'll see in that a government that's really working hard to listen and hear them on the issues that they've raised.""
The government revamped its pay offer by NZ$129 million ($86.82 million) to a total of NZ$698 million late last week, according to Education Minister Chris Hipkins. 
Members of the New Zealand Educational Institute (NZEI), the union representing primary school teachers, were considering the offer but had already voted to hold a series of day-long national strikes, closing hundreds of schools. 
Hipkins said in an emailed statement: ""It is disappointing that NZEI has decided to go ahead with strike action before asking its members to consider the strong new offer made this week during facilitation.""
The government's determination to stick to strict ""budget responsibility rules"", including delivering fiscal surpluses and paying down debt, has disappointed public service sectors. It sparked industrial action from nurses and court and tax department staff and prompted teachers in August to hold their first strike in 20 years.
Wage growth has remained sluggish in the island nation for years, despite soaring housing costs, which labor groups and economists say has left workers struggling.
Teachers have also singled out increased paperwork, staff shortages and growing class sizes as major issues, which the government has said it was working to address.
""The key things are the issues around workload and the huge amount of compliance, such as large class sizes. Teachers have tolerated this for too long,"" Newton Central school principal Riki Teteina told the New Zealand Herald newspaper during a protest by striking teachers in Auckland.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A 50-year-old woman will face court on Monday after police charged her with contaminating strawberries with needles, an episode that spurred one of Australia's biggest food scares.
Australia's strawberry industry, worth A$160 million ($116 million), was rocked in September after nearly 200 complaints were made of sewing needles found in strawberries and other fruits. 
Several major supermarkets withdrew the fruit as shoppers abandoned purchases, forcing some growers to dump fruit amid warnings of widespread bankruptcies.
Australian police said on Monday they had charged a 50-year woman with seven cases of contamination, the first charges laid in the case.
""This has probably been one of the most trying investigations that I've been part of,"" Queensland Police Detective Superintendent Jon Wacker told reporters in Brisbane, the capital of Queensland state where the contamination crisis was first reported.
Police said the woman was a former employee of one of the brands affected, although he did not specify which one.
The woman faces up to 10 years in jail if found guilty after Australia's conservative government toughened sentencing in a bid to contain the crisis. 
Australia also criminalized hoax claims.
Wacker said police received 186 complaints of fruit contamination, of which 15 had been found to be hoaxes.
Strawberry growers welcomed the charges but blamed social media for the crisis.
""It was a crisis driven by social media and the only real victims were the strawberry growers, and to some extent other Australian fruit growers and exporters,"" the Queensland Strawberry Growers Association said in a statement.
Queensland, Australia's largest strawberry-producing region, is particularly vulnerable to a sustained downturn in the market.
State premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said on Tuesday her government would set aside A$1 million ($722,400) to help farmers make it through the season.

The visit comes at a time when Riyadh, already under scrutiny for civilian deaths in Yemen air strikes, is facing global criticism and potential sanctions over the murder of Khashoggi at its Istanbul consulate on Oct. 2.
Britain has called for a ""credible"" investigation into Khashoggi and has pushed for new action at the United Nations Security Council to try to end hostilities in Yemen and find a political solution to the war there.
""The human cost of war in Yemen is incalculable: with millions displaced, famine and disease rife and years of bloodshed, the only solution is now a political decision to set aside arms and pursue peace,"" Hunt said in a statement.
""So today I am traveling to the Gulf to demand that all sides commit to this process.""
The foreign ministry said Hunt would meet Saudi Arabia's King Salman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, Yemeni Vice President Ali Mohsen and Foreign Minister Khaled Al Yamani. 
Hunt, the first British minister to visit Saudi Arabia since the murder of Khashoggi a month ago, will also call on the Saudi authorities to do more to deliver justice and accountability for his family.
""The international community remain united in horror and outrage at the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi one month ago. It is clearly unacceptable that the full circumstances behind his murder still remain unclear,"" he said.

""We encourage the Saudi authorities to cooperate fully with the Turkish investigation into his death, so that we deliver justice for his family and the watching world.""

The newspaper said two J-20 fighter jets opened their missile bay doors during a flypast on Monday, revealing that each jet had four missiles in its fuselage and one on either side of the aircraft.
Citing Chinese experts, the newspaper said the demonstration, which came on the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) Air Force, displayed the J-20's superiority to the top U.S. fighter jets, the F-22 and F-35, as well as the PLA's growing confidence. 
It also quoted military expert Song Zhongping as saying the four missiles in the J-20's fuselage were long-range air-to-air missiles, while the two on the sides were short-range combat missiles meant for aerial combat.

About 30 empty iron ore wagons in a 106-wagon train came off the track on Sunday south of the sparsely populated town of Norseman, some 700 km west of Perth, between the port of Esperance and Mineral Resources' Koolyanobbing mine.
No one was injured in the accident, the miner said.
""At this stage it appears that heavy rainfall and flash flooding in the region on Saturday washed out some ballast from under a small section of the track,"" Mineral Resources said in a statement to the Australian stock exchange.
""(Mineral Resources) does not expect this derailment to have a material impact on its Koolyanobbing iron ore production and shipment schedule.""
BHP, the world's biggest miner, last week suspended its rail operations in Western Australia after it was forced to derail a runaway train near the northern iron ore export hub of Port Hedland, about 1,500 km to the north.
Mineral Resources said there was damage to some of the derailed wagons but not to its locomotives. The owner and operator of the railway track, Arc Infrastructure, expects to complete repairs this week, it said. 
Arc Infrastructure is owned by global asset manager Brookfield Infrastructure Partners. 
Shares in Mineral Resources were down 1.5 percent against a 0.5 percent decline in the broader Australian market.

Just a year ago, May used her annual speech at the Lord Mayor's Banquet to accuse Moscow of military aggression and of meddling in elections, some of her strongest criticism even before the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Salisbury.
This year, she will tell London's financial center that the action taken since - including the largest ever coordinated expulsion of Russian intelligence officers - has deepened her belief in a ""collective response"" to such threats.
""We will continue to show our willingness to act, as a community of nations, to stand up for the rules around the world,"" May will say, according to excerpts of her speech.
Describing evolving threats, May will say the past year, including Salisbury, has ""shown that while the challenge is real, so is the collective resolve of likeminded partners to defend our values, our democracies, and our people.""
""But, as I also said a year ago, this is not the relationship with Russia that we want ... We remain open to a different relationship - one where Russia desists from these attacks that undermine international treaties and international security,"" she will say.
""And we hope that the Russian state chooses to take this path. If it does, we will respond in kind.""
May has said often that Britain's decision to leave the European Union does not mean a retreat into isolationism, and her words again seem aimed at underlining London's desire to play a weighty role in the world.

But with no mention of Brexit in the speech excerpts, she may be hoping to avoid going into too much detail of Britain's negotiations to leave the EU, which have split her cabinet, her Conservative Party and Britain's parliament.

Labor is now ahead of the Coalition 55 percent to 45 percent on a two-party preferred basis, up a point from a Newspoll two weeks earlier. An election is due by May 2019.
In a survey involving all political parties, the Coalition's support fell by 1 percentage point to 35 percent, while Labor gained a point to 40 percent.
Morrison's own ratings, which dropped after the Coalition lost a by-election for the seat of former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, fell further into negative ground even after he toured Queensland last week appealing to voters in crucial regional seats.
He has sunk to a net satisfaction rating of -8. Negative net satisfaction means more people are dissatisfied than satisfied with the person. The drop follows comments last week from Turnbull calling for an explanation on why he was dumped as leader. Morrison said it was because Turnbull had failed to connect with ordinary Australians.
Labor leader Bill Shorten's rating slipped to -15 from -13, according to the Newspoll.
The poll was conducted partly after an attack in Melbourne last Friday in which one man was stabbed to death and two were injured. The attacker, Hassan Khalif Shire Ali, who authorities said was an Islamic State sympathizer, was shot by police and later died.
Morrison blamed the attack on ""the radical and dangerous ideology of extremist Islam"" and said religious leaders must be proactive in ensuring ""these dangerous teachings and ideologies do not take root here."" 
The poll surveyed 1,802 people in all states of Australia from Thursday to Sunday. The sampling error was plus or minus 2.3 percentage points, Newspoll said.

It was the latest call by Johnson, the figurehead of Britain's campaign to leave the European Union, for May to drop her so-called Chequers plans in favor of negotiating a clean break with the bloc and securing a Canada-style free trade deal.
His comments come days after his brother, fellow Conservative lawmaker Jo Johnson, resigned as a transport minister over Brexit. Boris Johnson said he agreed with his brother that the Brexit talks were ""the biggest failure of UK statecraft since Suez"" when Britain lost control of the waterway in the 1950s.
""I really can't believe it but this government seems to be on the verge of total surrender,"" he wrote in his weekly column in the Telegraph newspaper. 
""I want you to savor the full horror of this capitulation ... we are on the verge of signing up for something even worse than the current constitutional position. These are the terms that might be enforced on a colony.""
The Independent website reported that May has been forced to abandon plans for a cabinet meeting on Monday to approve a Brexit deal.
Johnson accused the government of being unable to negotiate a way to end unilaterally a so-called backstop arrangement, designed to prevent the return of border controls between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland.
Such a failure would turn Britain into ""a vassal state"" until the bloc decided to move on to trade talks, he said.
""It is frankly hard to see why they should,"" he wrote, adding that May's Chequers plans, named after her country residence, were very much alive despite widespread criticism.

""The essence of the idea - that the UK should remain in the customs union and the single market for goods and agri-food - is what the backstop entails. And you can be absolutely sure that this idea will be at the heart of the 'deal' that I have no doubt the prime minister will shortly and magically secure.""

ADEN (Reuters) - Street battles raged on Sunday in residential areas of Yemen's main port city of Hodeidah, forcing medical staff to flee the largest hospital, as Houthi insurgents tried to repel forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition.
Residents said they saw bodies of seven civilians killed in clashes in southern suburbs, with both sides using mortar shells, anti-aircraft guns and assault rifles in the fight for the Houthi-held city, a lifeline for millions of Yemenis.
The coalition has renewed its offensive on Hodeidah as Western allies, including the United States, called for a ceasefire to support U.N.-led efforts to end the nearly four-year war that has killed more than 10,000 and pushed the country to the brink of starvation. 
Medical sources at al-Thawra hospital told Reuters that several staff members and patients able to move had fled the complex. It was not immediately clear how many patients remained inside.
""The Houthis are reinforcing their positions near the hospital and that is what scared people,"" said one staff member.
Hospital spokesman Khaled Attiyah told Reuters that doctors and nurses continued their work in departments such as intensive care, the burns ward and the emergency room ""despite the panic"". 
Last week, rights groups said the Houthis had raided the May 22 hospital in the city's eastern suburbs and posted gunmen on the roof, endangering doctors and patients.
The United Nations and aid groups have warned that a full-scale assault on Hodeidah, an entry point for 80 percent of the country's food imports and relief supplies, could trigger a famine in the already impoverished Arabian Peninsula state.
More than two dozen senior Obama administration officials, including former National Security Advisor Susan Rice and former CIA Director John Brennan, called on U.S. President Donald Trump to cease all support for the war.
In a telephone call with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reiterated Washington's call for ""a cessation of hostilities and for all parties to come to the table to negotiate a peaceful solution to the conflict,"" the State Department said.
""We hear loud shelling and they are using all kinds of weapons, it is terrifying,"" said resident Abdullah Mohammed. ""In the eastern suburbs, Apache (NYSE:APA) helicopters are bombing Houthi positions all day long.""
GRAIN MILL SEIZED 
Pro-coalition forces took control on Saturday of Red Sea Mills, a main grains facility south of the port which holds about 51,000 tonnes of wheat, a U.N. aid group said. 
""Around 60 shells fell inside the compound since the clashes reached that area few days ago but the silos and the grains were not touched,"" said Ali Reza Qureshi, Yemen's deputy director for the World Food Programme (WFP).
""We hope the production will resume in the coming next two weeks as we get 21,000 tonnes monthly from those mills, otherwise we will have to import wheat flour,"" he told Reuters.
The WFP said last week it plans to double its food assistance program for Yemen, aiming to reach up to 14 million people ""to avert mass starvation"".
The coalition has said that wresting control of Hodeidah would break the Houthis by cutting off their main supply line and force the group to the negotiating table to end the conflict, seen as a proxy war between Riyadh and Iran. 
The alliance, which relies on the West for arms and intelligence, intervened in Yemen's war in 2015 to restore the internationally recognized government ousted by the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement, which controls the most populated areas of Yemen including the capital Sanaa.
U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths has said he hopes to convene renewed peace talks by the end of the year after the last round of consultations collapsed in September.

The United Nations has no up-to-date estimate of the death toll in Yemen. It said in August 2016 that according to medical centers at least 10,000 people had been killed.

PARIS (Reuters) - The leaders of Germany and France called for a unified approach to fostering world peace at a forum in Paris on Sunday that was attended by dozens of heads of state and government with one notable exception: U.S. President Donald Trump.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the Paris Peace Forum, which followed a ceremony in the French capital to mark the centenary of the end of World War One, with a warning that ""blinkered"" nationalism was gaining ground in Europe and beyond. 
Echoing comments made by Macron, she said there was a worrying readiness by some to promote self-interest and ignore ties that have underpinned peace since the end of World War Two.
""Most of the challenges today cannot be solved by one nation alone, but together. That's why we need a common approach,"" Merkel told the audience. ""If isolation wasn't the solution 100 years ago, how can it be today in such an interconnected world?""
Macron hopes the forum can lead help avoid falling into the traps of the past by promoting multilateralism. He wants it to demonstrate the power of reconciliation a century after Europe was torn apart by one of history's bloodiest conflicts.
Leaders including Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan were among those who listened as Merkel, Macron and United Nations Secretary General Antonio Gutteres lauded the U.N. and institutions like it that seek multilateral solutions to global problems.
Trump, who champions a policy of 'America first' and has said he is proud to be a nationalist, snubbed the event. Air Force One departed Paris for Washington shortly after the peace forum opened.
Macron has repeatedly called for ""collective action"" to tackle crises ranging from the environment, Islamist militancy and nuclear proliferation to anti-Semitism. 
""Will today be a symbol of lasting peace or a last moment of unity before the world falls into more disorder?"" The French leader Macron asked the gathering. ""It depends solely us."" 
Earlier on Sunday, Macron led a solemn ceremony to commemorate the centenary of the armistice that brought the Great War to an end, and appeared to take aim at Trump as he warned of the perils of resurgent nationalism.
Justin Vaisse, who organized the forum, told Reuters it was not intended to mediate solutions to existing conflicts, but seek ways to create strengthen multilateral organizations.

It is designed to be held annually and bring together a mixture of politicians, foreign policy experts, non-governmental organizations and representatives of civil society, he said.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - A senior pilot who is also director of operations for Air India, and has had responsibility for flight safety and training, said he was told by the carrier he failed two breathalyzer tests on Sunday before a flight to London from New Delhi.
It is the second time Arvind Kathpalia, who is also on the loss-making airline's board, has been in trouble over alcohol tests. He was suspended for three months in 2017 for allegedly refusing to take breathalyzer tests.
Kathpalia told Reuters in an interview by phone that he would contest the results and claimed they were related to internal feuding within the state-owned company. 
According to a description for the operation director's job when Kathpalia got appointed in June 2017, he is responsible for flight operations, ground operations, and flight safety and training operations. 
It is unclear if those remain the job specifications. 
Air India declined to comment for this article.
Kathpalia failed two breathalyzer tests on Sunday and was declared unfit to fly, according to a pre-flight medical examination report for alcohol, posted on the website of news portal India Today.
Kathpalia, who denies he had been drinking, corroborated the results of the breathalyzer and said he was tested twice in a span of 20 minutes, adding that the second test's reading was higher than the first. 
""It was 1:30 in the afternoon, only a bloody stark raving alcoholic is bloody drunk at 1:30 in the afternoon,"" Kathpalia said. ""I am going to contest this.""
He said that at Air India ""everyone is fighting with everyone,"" and that he has been targeted.
In 2017, Kathpalia was suspended for three months when he had allegedly refused to take breathalyzer tests before and after his flight between Bengaluru and New Delhi and back in January 2017, according to a court document available on law portal Indiakanoon.
In August last year, the Indian Commercial Pilots Association, a trade union representing pilots of the state-owned carrier, filed a court case against Kathpalia requesting stern action against him over the missed breathalyzer tests and some other behavior.
Calls made to union representatives late on Sunday were not answered.
Kathpalia was executive director of flight operations during the earlier incident. 
When he was promoted to operations director it was contested by the union in its petition to the court.
The court ordered the New Delhi police to file a first information report (FIR), the first step in India's legal system that can lead to an investigation, against Kathpalia in August this year, according to reports in major Indian newspapers. 
New Delhi police officials could not immediately confirm the status of the case. 
The 2017 allegation ""was a complete set-up,"" said Kathpalia, who said it was the result of a scheduling issue rather than his refusal to take tests. 
He claims that he is under attack partly because he is an employee of the original Air India, which was India's international carrier, while the union is from the erstwhile Indian Airlines, which was a domestic carrier. The two airlines were merged into one in 2007.
""There is a lot of animosity after the merger. The animosity exists till today. They refuse to acknowledge each other,"" said Kathpalia.

Later in the same interview he spoke of the need for a European army, saying: ""Faced by Russia, which is on our borders and which has shown that it can be threatening... we need to have a Europe that can better defend itself by itself, without depending solely on the United States.""

The missile shipment came after Russia, a main backer of the Damascus government, accused Israel of indirectly causing the downing of a Russian military jet by Syrian air defenses following an Israeli air strike nearby.
Netanyahu, speaking to reporters on Sunday, also said he favored reaching an ""arrangement"" that would avoid an all out war with Gaza and stave off a deepening humanitarian crisis.

On Friday, Israel allowed $15 million of Qatari cash to enter the Gaza Strip, which is controlled by the Islamist Hamas movement. Egypt, Qatar and the United Nations have been trying to broker a long-term cease fire between Hamas and Israel.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top Democrats stepped up pressure Sunday on acting U.S. Attorney General Matthew Whitaker to step aside from overseeing a special counsel probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, vowing to order him to testify early next year.
Representative Jerrold Nadler, the expected incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said Sunday the committee plans to subpoena Whitaker to testify next year as its first witness. 
""He should recuse himself. He has expressed total hostility to the investigation,"" Nadler said on the ABC News show ""This Week."" ""His appointment is simply part of an attack on the investigation by Robert Mueller.""
In a letter to the Justice Department's chief ethics officer, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats asked whether any ethics attorneys at the Justice Department have advised Whitaker to recuse himself and demanded details on any ethics guidance Whitaker has received.
""Allowing a vocal opponent of the investigation to oversee it will severely undermine public confidence in the Justice Department’s work on this critically important matter,"" the letter said.
Democrats have increasingly expressed alarm since last week, when President Donald Trump ordered Attorney General Jeff Sessions to resign and replaced him with Whitaker, Sessions' chief of staff.
Sessions' ouster paved the way for Whitaker to take over oversight of Mueller's investigation from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller in May 2017 after Sessions recused himself from the probe.
Prior to working at the Justice Department, Whitaker made multiple negative comments about the Mueller investigation and its scope.
In addition, Whitaker is also a close friend of Trump's 2016 election campaign co-chair Sam Clovis, who has since become a witness in Mueller's investigation.
""Mr. Whitaker’s relationship with Mr. Clovis, who is a grand jury witness in the special counsel investigation, as well as Mr. Whitaker’s other entanglements, raise additional concerns about his ability to supervise the investigation independently and impartially,"" the letter said.
Kellyanne Conway, a counselor to Trump, defended Whitaker's oversight of the probe when asked about it on ABC's ""This Week.""
""Comments that Matt Whitaker made as a private citizen on cable TV does not disqualify him from being fair and impartial by overseeing this investigation.""
She added that Trump is ""100 percent behind Matt Whitaker.""

The United States said on Friday Iraq can continue to import natural gas and energy supplies from Iran for a period of 45 days, so long as Iraq does not pay Iran for imports in U.S. dollars. Sanctions on Tehran's oil sector took effect on Nov 5. 
""We do not want Iraq to be burdened with the U.S. sanctions on Iran,"" Barham Salih, the newly elected President, told reporters during a visit to the Gulf Arab state of Kuwait.
Iraq wanted to maintain ""balanced"" relations with all its neighbors and the international community, he said.
""Iran is a neighboring country and our interest lies in having good and stable relations with Iran,"" he said, adding the Iraqi people also wanted to deepen Arab and Gulf ties.
Iraq needs to rebuild its economy and infrastructure as it emerges from a ruinous conflict with Islamic State.

Iraq central bank officials said in August that the country's economy is closely linked to non-Arab Iran, which is locked in several proxy wars with Saudi Arabia in the region.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka's new prime minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and 44 former lawmakers have defected from the party led by President Maithripala Sirisena, splitting with the president barely two weeks after he installed Rajapaksa in office. 
Sirisena dissolved parliament on Friday night and called a general election for Jan. 5 in a move that has drawn international criticism as it is likely to deepen the country's political crisis. 
An intense power struggle has erupted in Sri Lanka in the past two weeks following Sirisena's sudden sacking of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the appointment of former leader Rajapaksa, a pro-China strongman, in his place.
Rajapaksa and 44 former lawmakers of the Sirisena-led center-left Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) on Sunday joined Sri Lanka Podujana Peremuna (SLPP), a political party formed in 2016 by Rajapaksa's younger brother Basil, a former economy minister.
An SLPP source said 65 out of 82 former SLFP MPs will eventually join the new party.
Namal Rajapaksa, an ex-lawmaker and son of Rajapaksa, said the SLFP's policies had not been pursued by Sirisena in the coalition government with the Wickremesinghe-led center-right United National Party (UNP).
""We all decided that this is the right time to join the SLPP,"" he told Reuters.
The SLPP recorded a landslide victory in local polls in February after Rajapaksa backed it. He did that while remaining in the SLFP.
Sirisena's allies have told Reuters that he wants a SLFP-led government. However, the defections will weaken Sirisena's more than seven-decade old party, they say.
Rohana Piyadaya, the SLFP secretary general declined to comment on the defections. 
Sirisena's move to sack the parliament has drawn international criticism. 
Farhan Haq, the spokesman for United Nations Secretary General António Guterres, said in a statement that Guterres has underlined the utmost importance of respecting democratic processes and institutions and resolving differences in accordance with the rule of law and due process. 
""He renews his call on the Government to ensure peace and safety for all Sri Lankans and uphold its commitments to human rights, justice and reconciliation,"" the spokesman said.
Sirisena previously defected from the SLFP, then led by Rajapaksa, in 2014 to join an opposition coalition that ousted Rajapaksa.
Later Sirisena rejoined the SLFP, took over its leadership and formed a national government with Wickremesinghe's party. 

However, a rift developed over policy towards China and India - Wickremesinghe has favored Indian investment as a counter to Chinese inroads in Sri Lankan infrastructure projects - and over Sirisena's intention to contest the 2020 presidential election under Wickremesinghe's party.

1356,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2018 10:30AM ET</span>",Iran sentences two to death in fight against economic crimes,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian special courts set up in a drive against economic crime have sentenced two people to death, state media said on Sunday, as the country faces renewed U.S. sanctions and a public outcry against profiteering and corruption.
The fast-track Islamic revolutionary courts were set up in August after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called for ""swift and just"" legal action to confront an ""economic war"" by foreign enemies.
Judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, quoted by the judiciary's news website Mizan, said the courts had handed down death sentences on two defendants after convicting them of ""spreading corruption on earth"", a capital offence under Iran’s Islamic laws.
In September, the courts handed down three death sentences on similar charges. 
Ejei said on Sunday that 11 more defendants had received jail terms of up to 10 years for ""economic corruption"", and a judge was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 75 lashes for taking bribes.
Iranian officials have accused arch-foes the United States and Israel, as well as regional rival Saudi Arabia and government opponents living in exile, of fomenting unrest and waging an economic war to destabilize Iran.
The rial currency has lost about 70 percent of its value in 2018 under the threat of the revived U.S. sanctions, with heavy demand for dollars and gold coins on the unofficial market from ordinary Iranians trying to protect their savings.
Ejei said 96 people had been arrested for charges linked to illegal trading in hard currencies or gold, Mizan reported. 
The cost of living has also soared, provoking sporadic demonstrations against profiteering and corruption, with many protesters chanting anti-government slogans.
Last Monday, the United States restored sanctions targeting Iran's oil, banking and transportation sectors and threatened more action to stop its ""outlaw"" policies, steps the Islamic Republic called economic warfare and vowed to defy.
In August, Washington reimposed a first round of sanctions after pulling out of a 2015 deal between world powers and Tehran under which international sanctions on Iran were lifted in return for curbs on its nuclear program.

Germany lost the war and Merkel's participation in a ceremony for the former allies amounted to an attempt to rewrite history, AfD co-leader Alexander Gauland said.
""We can't put ourselves in a historical situation that clearly favours the winner and walk alongside Mr. Macron through the Arc de Triomphe,"" he said, referring to the famous Paris monument.
Gauland's comments stood in marked contast to the themes of reconciliation and the need for vigilance against resurgent nationalism which characterised the official commemorations in London and Paris for the millions killed during World War One.

Its leaders have been rebuked for comments that appear to belittle the Nazi dictatorship or suggest that history books should be re-written to focus more on German victims.

In a rare public display of emotion, Macron and Merkel held hands on Saturday during a poignant ceremony in the Compiegne Forest, north of Paris, where French and German delegations signed the Armistice that ended the war, one of the bloodiest in history.

PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron used an address to world leaders gathered in Paris for Armistice commemorations on Sunday to send a stern message about the dangers of nationalism, calling it a betrayal of moral values.
With U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin sitting just a few feet away listening to the speech via translation earpieces, Macron denounced those who evoke nationalist sentiment to disadvantage others. 
""Patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism: nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism,"" Macron said in a 20-minute address delivered from under the Arc de Triomphe to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War One.
""By pursuing our own interests first, with no regard to others', we erase the very thing that a nation holds most precious, that which gives it life and makes it great: its moral values.""
Trump, who has pursued ""America First"" policies since entering the White House and in the run-up to the congressional elections this month declared himself a ""nationalist"", sat still and stony-faced in the front row as Macron spoke.
There was no immediate response from either the White House or the Kremlin to Macron's comments.
""OLD DEMONS""
In the week ahead of Sunday's commemoration, Macron spent time touring World War One battlefields in northern and eastern France, repeatedly warning in speeches of the resurgence of nationalism, saying it threatened the unity so carefully rebuilt in Europe over the past 70 years.
In one interview, he compared the political tone now to the 1930s, saying complacency towards unbridled nationalism then had opened the way for the rise of Hitler.
In part, his warnings seemed aimed at far-right parties that have gained ground across Europe in recent elections, including in France, where the National Front, now renamed the National Rally, has nudged ahead of Macron's En Marche movement in the polls ahead of European Parliament elections next May. 
Besides France, right-wing nationalist or populist parties are on the rise or now have a stake in power in Italy, Hungary, Poland, Austria and Slovenia, among others.
There has been a similar resurgence in nationalist-populist sentiment from Brazil to Turkey and the Philippines, echoing trends in Russia and the United States and challenging the multilateralism that leaders like Macron are keen to preserve.
In his address on Sunday, Macron said that ""old demons are reawakening"" and warned against ignoring the past.
""History sometimes threatens to repeat its tragic patterns, and undermine the legacy of peace we thought we had sealed with the blood of our ancestors,"" he said.
Asked in late October what he meant when he described himself as a nationalist, Trump cited his love of the country and said it was about putting it first economically.
""We're giving all of our wealth, all of our money, to other countries and then they don't treat us properly,"" he said.

""For many years other countries that are allies of ours... they have not treated our country fairly. So in that sense, I am absolutely a nationalist and I'm proud of it.""

The fighting in Jaghori district, an area inhabited mainly by Shi'ite ethnic Hazaras, has been going on since Wednesday, when Taliban fighters attacked the district and the government sent special forces units to back up local militia forces.
Police spokesman Ahmad Khan Sirat said six members of the security forces were wounded in addition to the 25 civilians and commandos who were killed.
The fighting took place as U.S. special envoy Zakmay Khalilzad prepared for a fresh round of meetings aimed at bringing the Taliban to the negotiating table to try to find a political settlement to the decades-long war in Afghanistan.
Although Afghanistan has traditionally not suffered from the sectarian violence that has scarred Iraq or Syria, suicide attacks on Shi'ite targets in recent years have caused deepening anger among Hazaras, a mainly Shi'ite minority.
The Taliban, a movement dominated by Sunni Muslim ethnic Pashtuns, does not have any openly sectarian agenda and deny targeting Shi'ites but many Hazaras have blamed Pashtuns for the attacks on mosques and cultural centers.
Angered by what many see as official indifference, Hazaras have formed militia groups of their own, fuelling concern among some officials and Western diplomats at the potential for an upsurge in ethnic, sectarian violence.
Disputes over the balance of representation between Hazaras and Pashtuns, the two largest groups in Ghazni, led to the postponement of last month's parliamentary election in the province.
On the other side of the country, in the northern province of Baghlan, at least 14 members of the Afghan security forces and civilians were killed and eight others were injured in Taliban attacks, provincial governor Abdulhai Nemati said.
A spokesman for the Taliban, Zabihullah Mujahid in statements said killed 36 Afghan security forces and captured one military base five security checkpoints in Ghazni and Baghlan provinces.

1363,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2018 07:39AM ET</span>","Change tack or face defeat, Brexit critics tell British PM May","By Elizabeth Piper
LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May was under growing pressure on Sunday to change her plan for Britain to leave the European Union to avoid defeat in a parliamentary vote.
With both Britain and the EU suggesting an agreement is close, eurosceptic lawmakers and a leading member of a small Northern Irish party that props up her Conservative government made new threats to vote against the terms of the deal she is working on with Brussels. 
The vote in parliament, most likely to come later this year, is gearing up to be the biggest showdown in the lengthy negotiations to leave the EU, Britain's biggest shift in foreign and trade policy in more than 40 years.
May, who was attending a ceremony to mark 100 years since the end of World War One, found some support from ministers in her cabinet, but it would be hard for her to ignore the growing calls to change tack after a minister resigned and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party threatened to rebel.
""If the government makes the historic mistake of prioritizing placating the EU over establishing an independent and whole UK, then regrettably we must vote against the deal,"" Steve Baker, a leading eurosceptic and former minister, wrote alongside the DUP's Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson in the Sunday Telegraph newspaper.
The main battleground is over a so-called backstop to prevent the return of a hard border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland, something that would only come into force if a deal on future ties cannot guarantee the type of frictionless trade needed to keep it open.
DEPTH OF ANGER
Fears that proposals would mean keeping Britain inside the EU's customs union indefinitely or that Northern Ireland would have to accept different rules and regulations to the rest of the United Kingdom have focused opposition to May's deal.
Eurosceptics have long criticized May's proposals, but it was the resignation of Jo Johnson, the remain-voting younger brother to Brexit campaign leader Boris Johnson, that highlighted the depth of anger over her plans.
Many say May's desire to prioritize free flowing trade of goods with the rest of Europe will make Britain little more than a ""rule taker"", unable to break free of Brussels' decisions.
Comments by Education Minister Damian Hinds will also do little to temper those concerns. He told the BBC Britain could not push for a deal giving London the sole right to say when it was ready to leave any backstop arrangement.
""The prime minister has to negotiate something which is negotiable with the other side as well as working for people here,"" Hinds said.
But May did find some support. Both he, and the eurosceptic leader of the lower house of parliament, Andrea Leadsom, said they supported the prime minister.
""I mean to support the prime minister to get a Brexit that works for the United Kingdom and the EU, keeps our country together and delivers on the referendum,"" said Leadsom, who some media reported was considering quitting her post.
She said she did not expect further resignations, adding: ""I do urge colleagues to support the prime minister. We are at a very difficult stage ... but it is a negotiation, so what we have to do is to hold our nerve and keep negotiating.""

PARIS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan discussed how to respond to the killing last month of Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi, a White House official said on Sunday.
The conversation took place during a Saturday dinner with heads of state gathered in Paris to mark the World War One Armistice centenary.
Khashoggi, a critic of ruling Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was murdered at the kingdom's Istanbul consulate by a team sent from Riyadh. Saudi authorities have acknowledged that the killing was premeditated, but his body has not been found.
Erdogan revealed on Saturday that audio recordings of the killing had been given to the U.S., French, German and British governments, adding that the operation had been ordered at the ""highest levels"" of the Saudi government.
Trump expects to form a ""much stronger opinion"" by next week on Khashoggi's killing and Washington's response, he said on Nov. 7 - adding that he was working with Congress, Turkey and Saudi Arabia to establish who bore responsibility.

1365,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2018 07:22AM ET</span>",Iraq rail service back on track after war with Islamic State,"By John Davison
BAGHDAD/FALLUJA, Iraq (Reuters) - At Baghdad's grand but half-empty railway station, a single train is sputtering to life. It is the newly revived daily service to Falluja, a dusty town to the west once infamous as a Sunni insurgent stronghold.
The driver and conductor assure that the tracks running through Anbar province are now clear of mines planted by Islamic State and of collapsed bridges the group blew up when it marauded through western and northern Iraq in 2014.
The rapid advance of the militants shut down the line, before U.S.-backed Iraqi forces drove them out of Falluja in 2016 and defeated them in Iraq in late 2017.
After a four-year hiatus, hundreds of rail passengers now travel the 30 miles (50 km) between Baghdad and Falluja in just over an hour. By car, the journey can take several.
""The train saves time. The Baghdad-bound leg arrives at 8 a.m., which suits my schedule. It's also cheaper"" than by car at 3,000 Iraqi dinars ($2.50) for a ticket, commuter Thamer Mohammed said.
""You don't have to stop at checkpoints, and it's safer. You avoid road accidents,"" said the 42-year-old, a Falluja resident studying for a history doctorate in Baghdad.
The revival in July of the daily service, once a feature of an extensive rail network dating back to the Ottoman empire, is a vivid example of Iraq's attempts to recover from decades of unrest.
Passengers see it as a metaphor for the country's state: security has improved enough to allow unhindered passage through countryside dominated for years by Islamic State and al Qaeda militants. But the train is dilapidated and shudders as it gathers speed.
The state of the tracks allow a steady pace of up to around 70 miles per hour (100 km), but no more. Dozens of windows have been smashed by children who play in the dirt in poor Baghdad districts and pelt carriages with stones as they cruise by.
""I hope the service will keep running, but in the last few days there have been delays. Sometimes it runs out of fuel on the journey, or has technical failures,"" Mohammed said.
Abdul Sittar Muhsin, a media official for the national operator Iraqi Republic Railways, said the company was in dire need of funding to keep the service running.
""We did this with the company's money and we're operating at a loss,"" he said.
Regular passengers include unemployed youth looking for work, a perennial problem in Iraq where demonstrations over lack of jobs, water and power turned violent in the southern city of Basra in September.
""I had a job interview with an NGO today in Baghdad, but I'm not holding out much hope,"" said Yassin Jasim, a recent graduate with a degree in medicine. ""I try to get casual work in Falluja, but there's little and it's low pay.""
BAGHDAD TO ISTANBUL
Jasim and his family moved to the relative security of Erbil in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq while Islamic State held Falluja.
The city and fertile countryside along the Euphrates river suffered a series of bruising battles after the U.S. invasion in 2003 that toppled Saddam Hussein. Falluja became infamous in 2004 when four American security contractors were killed and their bodies hung from a bridge in the city.
Everywhere are reminders of a delicate security situation. Armed police patrol the train, which runs past a scrapyard of cars destroyed during fighting and the remains of a road bridge blown up by militants.
Railway officials hope to restore services all the way to the Syrian border. Iraq's rail network, developed during the British mandate period and under Baath party rule in the 1960s, used to stretch to Istanbul and Aleppo in Syria via Mosul in northern Iraq.
Conflict with Iran in the 1980s, UN sanctions in the 1990s and violence since then have wrecked most of the old network, apart from regular services to Basra and now Falluja.
Plans to extend beyond Falluja might be ambitious - tracks are buried in sand and Iraqi forces have been reinforced at the border after recent Islamic State counter-attacks in Syria.
For now, the Falluja line is a big step forward.

""It's great, I can regularly see my daughter now who is marrying a man from Falluja,"" one woman said. ""At the moment, things are fine.""

His words will further anger eurosceptics in Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party who fear the backstop, an insurance policy if a deal on future ties does not guarantee an open border, could keep Britain in the European Union's customs union indefinitely.
""The prime minister has to negotiate something which is negotiable with the other side as well as working for people here.

1368,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2018 05:26AM ET</span>","Softly, softly for now, British PM May's enforcers gear up for big Brexit vote","By Elizabeth Piper
LONDON (Reuters) - Less than five months before Britain leaves the European Union, Prime Minister Theresa May's parliamentary enforcers are on the prowl.
For now, the government ""whips"" whose job it is to ensure parliament backs whatever Brexit deal May agrees with Brussels are taking a softly-softly approach. But Chief Whip Julian Smith and his team have a powerful armory at their disposal to force politicians into line. 
With an agreement most likely to go before lawmakers later this year, May's team and the whips she appointed are quietly sounding out who might vote against it, several politicians told Reuters.
Lacking a parliamentary majority, May is hostage not only to her bitterly divided Conservative Party over Brexit but also to the Northern Irish party that props up her government.
It was never going to be easy, but is looking even more difficult after the resignation on Friday of Jo Johnson, a transport minister and brother to leading Brexit campaigner Boris Johnson. There are also suggestions that others in government may follow and that there could be a rebellion by the Democratic Unionist Party. 
So far, the whips' tactics show no sign of success. 
To persuade them to support the government, some euroskeptic Conservatives have been wined and dined, including at May's Downing Street office.
Others, including some members of the opposition Labour Party, have been invited to private meetings at which they have been asked their opinions and subjected to painstaking explanations of the prime minister's position.
""I am not going to change my mind, no matter how nice a dinner might be,"" said one Conservative lawmaker on condition of anonymity, explaining that he had refused three invitations to Downing Street for such a meal.
""Clearly they are trying to pick off people who they think might be malleable ... but frankly first of all, before they get to that point, they should be able to explain what the government is going to do, and at the moment no one has a clue.""
WHIPPED INTO LINE
Government and opposition parties each have their own whips -- a term with its roots in fox-hunting that dates back to 1742 and refers to the ""whipping"" of lawmakers to get them to attend votes and support the party line. 
They also act as tellers for parliamentary votes and manage the pairing system with rival parties that ensures genuine absences do not skew votes in parliament. 
Smith outraged lawmakers in July when he told some Conservatives to break a pairing arrangement, in what May said was ""an honest mistake"". One then voted with the government at a key Brexit vote even though his Liberal Democrat ""pair"" was away as she had just given birth.
Tactics used by whips in the past are the stuff of parliamentary legend. A series of votes on the Maastricht Treaty on deeper EU integration in the early 1990s brought reports of blackmail, threats to expose lawmakers' indiscretions and even physical ""manhandling"" to win support.
One former Conservative Chief Whip, Gavin Williamson, kept a pet tarantula on his desk -- named Cronus after the Greek god who ate his own children. He once said that while he preferred the carrot to the stick, ""it is amazing what can be achieved with a sharpened carrot"". 
Such practices have inspired television shows such as the British and U.S. versions of House of Cards.
But for many in parliament now, such behavior bears little resemblance to the reality of everyday political life. The strongest coercion so far over the Brexit vote, lawmakers say, has been the promise of budget sweeteners to curry favor.
""They can make your life difficult,"" said one lawmaker, recounting how the whips once refused him permission to be absent from parliament for a family celebration because he would have missed a vote. 
The whips can also threaten to put wavering lawmakers on ""boring procedural committees"" or block any career promotion, another member of parliament said. Defying a strict ""three-line"" whip can lead to a lawmaker's temporary expulsion from their party in parliament. 
The whips themselves must support the party line or quit.
PARLIAMENTARY PROMISES
May has promised to give parliament a say over Brexit, Britain's biggest foreign and trade policy shift in decades. If lawmakers vote down the deal she agrees, Britain could leave the EU without clarity on the terms of its departure, causing uncertainty for businesses and trade and making a challenge to May's leadership or an early election more likely.
May says the agreement with Brussels is 95 percent complete, although how to prevent a return to a hard border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland remains a sticking point in talks and within her cabinet. 
And while even winning the backing of her top ministers for any deal is a struggle, her main challenge will be securing the support of parliament, where divisions opened by Britain's 2016 referendum to leave the EU have become deeply entrenched.
In the 650-member lower chamber, May has a working majority of 13 only with the support of Northern Ireland's DUP. Their ""confidence and supply"" deal was negotiated by the two parties' whips after a June 2017 election produced a hung parliament. 
More than 50 Conservative lawmakers have said they reject May's so-called Chequers plan and at the weekend, DUP leader Arlene Foster said her party could not support her proposals as they now stand. The prime minister may have to break with tradition and rely on support from the Labour Party.
With ""the ink drying"" on a deal, as one euroskeptic lawmaker described it, minds are increasingly focused.
""I couldn't support the Chequers proposals, and they have been further diluted through negotiations with the European Union, so I will not be able to vote for the final deal,"" said Andrew Bridgen, a Conservative lawmaker and Brexit supporter.
He told Reuters the deal that is taking shape would not allow Britain to do full trade deals including goods and failed to hand back power to parliament from ""unelected eurocrats"".
The whips, whose work is largely behind the scenes and who do not give interviews, will need to crush similar dissent to get the vote passed. For now, they are not indicating how they will do this. 
Asked whether he would change his mind if the whips applied pressure, Bridgen said: ""I don't think the whips will bother trying to turn nasty on me. They know from experience that it won't work.""
But other lawmakers say the heat will only be turned up when a deal is done.

""I think their conversations with colleagues are a bit premature anyway,"" said one. ""But once we do know what the (government is) going to do, by and large people will have pretty fixed positions.""

PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron welcomed world leaders to the Elysee Palace on Sunday ahead of a commemoration at the Arc de Triomphe to mark the 100th anniversary of the Armistice that brought World War One to an end.
Standing in the courtyard of the Elysee under slow and steady rain, Macron and his wife Brigitte welcomed some 70 monarchs, heads of state and prime ministers. All will travel together in buses to the Arc de Triomphe for the ceremony. 
U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to join them there.
The commemoration is the centerpiece of global tributes to honor the 10 million soldiers killed during the 1914-18 war and mark the moment the Armistice, signed in northeastern France, came into effect at 11 a.m. on Nov. 11, 1918. 
World leaders, including Trump, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, will be seated under a glass canopy at the foot of the Arc de Triomphe, built by Emperor Napoleon in 1806, for the ceremony. 
Macron is expected to speak and light a flame in honor of an unknown soldier who was killed in the war and whose remains are buried with others under the triumphal arch. Afterwards, Macron will host a lunch for the dignitaries at the Elysee.
In a rare public display of emotion by the leaders of two world powers, Macron and Merkel held hands on Saturday during a poignant ceremony in the Compiegne Forest, north of Paris, where French and German delegations signed the Armistice that ended the war.
Testimonies written by soldiers on Nov. 11, 1918, as the ceasefire took hold, will be read at Sunday's event by high school students in French, English and German.
The conflict was one of the bloodiest in history, reshaping Europe's politics and demographics. Peace, however, was short-lived and two decades later Nazi Germany invaded its neighbors.
On Sunday afternoon, Macron will host the inaugural Paris Peace Forum, which seeks to promote a multilateral approach to security and governance and ultimately avoid the errors that led to the outbreak of World War One.
Merkel said in a statement the forum showed that ""today there is a will, and I say this on behalf of Germany with full conviction, to do everything to bring a more peaceful order to the world, even though we know we still have much work to do.""
Trump, who champions a nationalist 'America first' policy, will not attend the forum. 
The U.S. leader has said he will also not hold a bilateral meeting with Putin in Paris. Trump and Putin are expected to have formal talks later this month when both attend a G-20 summit in Buenos Aires.
Should the two leaders chat briefly during Sunday's events, their body language will be closely scrutinized. 

Special Counsel Robert Mueller is probing alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and any possible collusion with Trump's campaign.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Two former coup leaders are seen as the leading contenders in Fiji's general election on Wednesday, the second to be held since 2006 when then-commander of the armed forces Frank Bainimarama seized power.
The former British colony of more than 300 Pacific islands, with a population of about 910,000, was suspended from the British Commonwealth and isolated diplomatically after the bloodless coup. 
Bainimarama stood down from the military to run as a civilian in the country's 2014 elections, winning in a landslide, and the country has been welcomed back to the international community, enjoying a visit in October from Britain's Prince Harry and his wife Meghan.
Former prime minister Sitiveni Rabuka, who himself led two coups in 1987, is the main opposition candidate.
Rabuka, who leads the Social Democratic Liberal Party of Fiji, known as Sodelpa, which is running on a platform of government transparency, will not know until Monday afternoon whether he is eligible to be elected after being accused of deliberately breaching financial disclosure laws.
On Saturday he was questioned by police over an unrelated matter concerning a debate with Bainimarama about the National Bank of Fiji last Monday, Sodelpa general secretary Adi Qionibaravi told Reuters by telephone from Suva.
Qionibaravi said despite the setbacks, Sodelpa could beat Bainimarama's FijiFirst party.
""We are very confident,"" she said.
Stewart Firth, an Australian National University (ANU)Pacific Islands research fellow, said Bainimarama had the advantage of incumbency was likely to win.
Firth said Bainimarama had the support of about 80 percent of Fijians of Indian descent, who are the country's largest minority, while Sodelpa is regarded as a pro-indigenous Fijian party.
The ANU researcher said there was a chance of a coup attempt if the opposition were to win an upset victory because the army supported Bainimarama, even though the military had promised to accept the result.
The elections will also be contested by the National Federation Party, the country's third-largest party, led by economics professor Biman Prasad.
The NFP's campaign manifesto says its priorities are a living wage for workers and farmers and lifting ""the climate of fear that covers our country"".

Pre-poll voting ended Saturday afternoon ahead of a 48-hour media blackout that begins on Monday before the Nov. 14 general election.

The Turkish army uses the phrase neutralize when it has killed, captured or wounded combatants. The air strike carried out on Saturday targeted the Avasin region, the military said.
""Fourteen armed members of the separatist terror organization, who were in preparation for an attack on military bases, were neutralized. Weapons, hideouts and armories were destroyed,"" the military said, using its term for the PKK.
Turkey regularly carries out air strikes against PKK targets in northern Iraq, where the group is based in the Qandil mountains.

The Jatiya Oikyafront, a 20-party alliance led by 81-year-old Dr Kamal Hossain, had in particular wanted a caretaker government to take over in the weeks heading into the polls. The BNP says a caretaker government is essential for free and fair elections, but the ruling Awami League says the demand is unconstitutional.
The BNP, which is in disarray following the jailing of its chief, former prime minister Khaleda Zia, on corruption charges, had also pressed for a caretaker government at the 2014 election and boycotted it after the demand was not met. The last election was marred by deadly violence and shunned by international observers as flawed.
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government is seeking to be reelected for a third successive term.
“With the aim of rescuing democracy and a continuation of the movement to sustain a democratic process, Jatiya Oikyafront decided to participate in the election,"" said Hossain in a statement, following days of deliberations with alliance members.
Hasina’s government has won widespread global plaudits for letting in hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees who fled persecution in Myanmar, but its critics have decried Hasina’s increasingly authoritarian rule. In particular, they have attacked her for the government’s heavy-handed handling of student protests this year and its crackdown on free speech.
While announcing the election date on Thursday, K.M. Nurul Huda, the head of Bangladesh’s Election Commission, urged all parties to participate in the election ""to make it meaningful”.

Hasina and Khaleda, who between them have ruled Bangladesh for decades, are bitter rivals and the BNP says its leader has been jailed on trumped-up charges to keep her out of politics.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asia-Pacific leaders will join the heads of Southeast Asian states this week in Singapore to renew calls for multilateralism and fresh pledges to resolve regional conflicts ranging from the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar to tensions in the South China Sea.
Notably absent when regional powers such as China, Japan and India seek to enlist support for a multilateral trading system will be U.S. President Donald Trump, whose decision to skip the Asia summit has raised questions about his commitment to a regional strategy aimed at checking China's rise.
Vice President Mike Pence will attend instead of Trump, and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe are among those expected to join leaders from the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
Li is expected to rally support for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) pact now being negotiated, showcased to be the free trade deal that will encompass more than a third of the world's GDP. 
The pact includes 16 countries, including China, India, Japan and South Korea, but not the United States.
Trump has demanded trade agreements that are fair and enforceable and based on the principle of reciprocity. He has re-negotiated an existing pact with South Korea and the three-way deal with Mexico and Canada, and pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, which involved four Southeast Asian states.
The United States is also in the midst of a bitter trade war with China which has undermined global markets.
China is pushing the RCEP deal - Assistant Foreign Minister Chen Xiaodong told reporters on Thursday it ""will be of great significance for deepening regional cooperation, coping with unilateralism and protectionism, and promoting an open, inclusive and rules-based international trading system."" 
However, Li is expected to appeal in Singapore for the need for the world's two largest economies to work together to resolve trade disputes, reiterating commitment made by Beijing's top leaders last week for market opening and lowering tariffs.
It was not clear if Li and Pence will hold separate talks on the sidelines of the Singapore meetings, which would be a prelude to a summit scheduled between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the end of the month in Buenos Aires.
The encounter, if it happens, would come on the heels of high-level talks in Washington where the two sides aired their main differences but appeared to attempt controlling the damage to relations that has worsened with tit-for-tat tariffs in recent months.
Many of the leaders in Singapore will also meet at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Papua New Guinea next weekend.
ASEAN, which will hold its own summit on Tuesday before being joined by other leaders, also faces the challenge of working through sharp differences over the handling of the Rohingya minority by Myanmar whose military has been accused of ""genocidal intent"" by the United Nations.
Leader Aung San Suu Kyi is due to attend the Singapore meetings this week while Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, attending his first multilateral summit since returning to power in May, has served notice he has lost faith in the Nobel peace laureate over the issue.
The Rohingya crisis is one of the biggest man-made disasters involving a member since ASEAN was founded in 1967, and it is one of the thorniest issues yet faced by a group that traditionally works by consensus.
Many diplomats and rights activists say ASEAN's credibility is at risk if it fails to tackle the matter head-on. 
At the meetings, ASEAN and China will try to make headway in negotiations for a code of conduct for the South China Sea, which Beijing claims almost in its entirety while ASEAN members Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei claim parts of the area. Taiwan is also a claimant.
But an agreement is unlikely to be announced.

Also, ASEAN members states may announce the successful conclusion of agreements with Russia and the United States on cooperating on cyber security.

MELBOURNE/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Thousands of people attended memorial services across Melbourne to mark the centenary of the Armistice ending World War One, shrugging off heightened security after Friday's attack in Australia's second largest city which police branded terrorism.
Attendance at Melbourne's the Shrine of Remembrance was bigger than expected, with visitors determined to show they were not bowed by Friday's stabbing of three civilians, one fatal, by Islamic State sympathizer Hassan Khalif Shire Ali, 30.
""Carry on,"" Kate Mansell, the mother of a toddler and a baby in a stroller, told Reuters.
""Life goes on,"" said Alison Brett, visiting Melbourne from Australia's Northern Territory.
Her daughter, Belinda, who lives near the shrine, said she was not worried about being in public after Friday’s attack.
""You can’t let that stop you,"" she said.
At the shrine, across the river from the scene of the Bourke Street attack, a substantial but unobtrusive police presence guarded a crowd of about 4,000.
Melbourne's Pellegrini Espresso Bar, full to overflowing with floral arrangements left by mourners, remained closed on Sunday as visitors placed flowers on the pavement outside and taped letters of condolence on the cafe door.
The cafe was owned by popular 74-year-old restaurateur Sisto Malaspina who was stabbed to death after going to help Shire Ali, mistakenly thinking the attacker's car had broken down, according to witnesses quoted by ABC News.
Shire Ali had set the car, packed with gas cylinders, alight, but it did not explode.
Homeless man Michael Rogers, who became a hero when he used a shopping trolley to try to ward off Shire Ali as he lunged at two police officers, was showered with donations from well-wishers contributing to a fundraising account set up for him by a charity.
The GoFundMe account had raised more than A$50,000 ($36,000) as of Sunday night and was still growing.
PASSPORT CANCELED
Victorian Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton said on Saturday the attack was terrorism. Australian Federal Police Assistant Commissioner Ian McCartney said the attacker was inspired by Islamic State.
Police said Shire Ali had his Australian passport canceled in 2015 after an intelligence report that he planned to travel to Syria but an assessment was made that while he had radical views, he posed no threat to national security.
Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton defended the work of security authorities which he said had 400 open investigations and needed information from the public to stop spontaneous attacks. ""The police can't contemplate every circumstance,"" he told reporters in Brisbane.
Dutton said encryption technology made it difficult for authorities to gather intelligence.
""That is why it is important for us to get as much information from the imams, from spouses, from family members, community members, council workers, people that might be interacting with those that might have changed their behaviors, where they think they've been radicalized,"" the Australian Associated Press quoted him as saying.
Imam Isse Musse, a friend of the attacker's family, for 25 said the family told him Shire Ali was mentally ill.
""They say he had a mental problem,"" he told Reuters.
""If someone is mentally ill they can be a prey for any propaganda, any misinterpretation ... but what can we do? The family worked hard to take him to the doctor to be diagnosed but he said no and wouldn't co-operate.
""We are very disappointed with the event...we extend our sympathy to everyone who was made a victim.""
In the capital, Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Chief of Defence Force General Angus Campbell, other military personnel and diplomats attended a Remembrance Day service at the Australian War Memorial.

""As we commemorate the centenary of the Armistice and cast our minds back over the years, we know too well the deep scars of war and long to prevent them from touching an Australian soul,"" Morrison said in a televised speech.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean military transport aircraft began a tangerine airlift to North Korea on Sunday, the first of a gift of 200 tons of the fruit from the southern island of Jeju, South Korea's presidential Blue House said.
The present comes after the North Koreans gave South Korean President Moon Jae-in two tonnes of pricey pine mushrooms after a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in September.
North Korea has pursued nuclear and missile program in defiance of U.N. sanctions and South Korean officials said last week they had tested the mushrooms for radiation after an opposition lawmaker complained.
The Jeju tangerines were packed in 20,000 boxes and will be flown to Pyongyang by four C-130 aircraft during multiple flights on Sunday and Monday, the Blue House said in a statement.
Several senior South Korean officials, including Vice Unification Minister Chun Hae-sung and presidential secretary for unification policy Suh Ho, flew to Pyongyang to deliver the first shipment. 
North Korean leader Kim faces continued international pressure over his weapons program.
He vowed to work toward denuclearization during his historic June summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, but Pyongyang's actions have fallen short of U.S. demands for irreversible steps to scrap its arsenal, including a full disclosure of nuclear facilities and materials.
That has left inter-Korean efforts limited by international and unilateral sanctions that bar many forms of economic interaction with North Korea.

But South and North Korea have conducted a number of inter-Korean projects designed to lower tensions, including joint sports and cultural events, closing some guardposts along their shared border, and regular high-level negotiations.

Michael Rogers, nicknamed ""Trolley Man"" on social media, repeatedly tried to ram the attacker, Hassan Khalif Shire Ali, who was lunging at police and had earlier stabbed three people, one fatally, in Friday's attack.
His actions were filmed by witnesses, and local media and a charity tracked him down afterwards to get his story.
""I have seen the trolley to the side, so I've picked it up and I ran and threw the trolley straight at him. Got him but didn't get him down,"" Rogers told Channel Seven.
""And I did that motion about - quite a number of times, but it just wasn't getting him down,"" he said.
Rogers' bravery was made even more remarkable as he was meters away from a vehicle containing gas cylinders that Shire Ali had set alight. He quickly became a hero on social media as people praised his selfless act.
Donna Stolzenberg, the founder of registered charity Melbourne Homeless Collective, started a fundraising page on GoFundMe to help the homeless man.
""As a person he just deserves it,"" she told Reuters by telephone from Melbourne.
By Sunday evening it had raised more than A$52,000, exceeding its original goal of A$45,000.
Stolzenberg said Rogers was going to need a lot of support including with financial literacy and in making sure nobody takes advantage of him.
""This funding is growing and may grow further,"" she said.
""Michael is experiencing homelessness and probably hasn't had much experience with large sums of money.""
Ms Stolzenberg said her organization would also help him to find housing and organize trauma support for him to process the extraordinary events of Friday afternoon.

Reuters was unable to contact Rogers.

KIEV/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Rebel-controlled Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine hold leadership elections on Sunday in the shadow of a conflict that has killed more than 10,000 people and poisoned relations between Ukraine and Russia. 
Ukraine and its international backers have lined up to condemn the vote as a sham manipulated by the Russian authorities and in violation of a 2015 Minsk ceasefire agreement. The United States urged voters to boycott.
Backed by Moscow, separatist rebels seized territory in eastern Ukraine after pro-Western protests toppled President Viktor Yanukovich in February 2014 and Russia annexed Crimea a month later. 
The United States called the elections a charade to give false legitimacy to Moscow-approved leaders already installed in the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics. It announced new sanctions on Russia on Thursday.
""These particular elections are a mockery, really, of the idea of genuine elections that need to be held,"" Kurt Volker, Washington's envoy to the Ukraine conflict, told reporters on a conference call on Thursday. 
""They are under conditions of occupation, where there is no freedom of expression, no freedom of movement, no freedom of campaigning, and generally therefore no freedom of choice for the people in electing candidates for legitimate local leadership positions,"" he said. 
Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko called the elections ""illegal and represent yet another example of Russian subversive activity."" 
Russia disputes that the elections violate the Minsk agreement.
""Actually, the deplorable situation with the implementation of the Minsk package was provoked by Kiev's unwillingness to fulfill the Minsk agreements,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. 
The Donetsk region's acting head, Denis Pushilin, is running in Sunday's election after his predecessor Alexander Zakharchenko died in an explosion in August. Russia pointed the finger at Ukraine, while Kiev's security service blamed internal fighting ""between the terrorists and their Russian sponsors"".
Several former separatist leaders have fled the Donbass area, saying they feared for their lives after their comrades turned on them. Other leading separatist commanders have been killed in unexplained circumstances.
""Pushilin is a soap bubble, there are completely different people behind him, this is Moscow,"" a former separatist leader Alexei Alexandrov told Reuters. 
Ukraine-based analyst Volodymyr Fesenko said Russia was using the elections to give legitimacy to the region's leaders and may try to turn the fighting into a frozen conflict with the two breakaway regions as protectorates. 

Peskov acknowledged Russia had influence on the region's leaders but said ""it is not unlimited.""

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong suggested on Sunday a general election may be called next year, more than a year before his government's mandate ends, as the city-state braces for growing economic uncertainty amid global trade tensions.
Lee's People's Action Party (PAP) has dominated Singapore's politics over the five decades since the republic's independence, winning all the elections with significant majorities, and faces no real challenge to its power.
But it has tried to address signs of voter discontent by vowing to ease wealth disparity and improve social mobility, while moving ahead with a leadership transition to pick a successor who will take over from Lee in coming years.
""This may be the last party conference before the next general election,"" Lee told the PAP convention.
""The new CEC (Central Executive Committee) will be leading the party into the final stretch, gearing up to put our record before the voters,"" Lee said.
The annual convention elected a new Central Executive Committee on Sunday bringing into its top ranks young cabinet ministers, dubbed 4G leaders, from whose number Lee's successor will be selected.
Seven senior party members who have led the party and government, including the two current deputy prime ministers, retired from the committee.
Singapore's central bank has warned that an intensifying trade row between China and the United States is likely to hurt its economy, hitting harder as the trade dispute drags on.
Lee, the eldest son of Singapore founding leader Lee Kuan Yew, has made clear he was ready to step down in the next couple of years, but no clear successor has been chosen from a group of younger ministers tasked with selecting a leader from their ranks.
""The PAP must win the next general election convincingly,"" Lee told the convention. ""We take a pragmatic and centrist approach in our politics and in our policies. And we're setting a clear direction supported by the broad mass of Singaporeans who want to see stability and progress continue for many years.""

PAP's worst showing at the poll was in 2011 when 40 percent of voters turned against it, partly in protest over growing strains on public services.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Authorities in Poland stepped up security in the capital on Sunday ahead of a march planned by eurosceptic leaders and far-right groups to celebrate a century of national independence.
The march is a focus of debate about whether the conservative Law and Justice Party (PiS) party of government tacitly encourages groups with roots in the fascist and anti-Semitic movements.
Last year, an annual march organized each Nov. 11 by the far right for nearly a decade in Warsaw was dotted with racist banners such as ""pure blood, clear mind"" and ""Europe will be white or uninhabited"".
The slogans fueled concern about the rise of xenophobia in Poland at a time when other European countries are also grappling with a resurgence of the far right.
Warsaw's city mayor sought to ban this year's march but a court overruled her. The government then agreed with organizers after last-minute talks to hold a joint event to mark a 100 years since Poland's 1918 declaration of independence after an 18th century partition by Russia, Austria and Germany.
""What brings us together is (Poland's) white and red flag,"" Interior Minister Mariusz Blaszczak told state broadcaster TVP on Saturday. ""I invite everyone to attend.""
PiS says it rejects anti-Semitism and racism but critics accuse it of quietly siding with the far-right.
Since its election in 2015, the party has seen Poland increasingly isolated in Europe amid accusations of a tilt towards authoritarian rule. It promises more Catholic values and patriotism in public life and more state say in the economy.
The party taps into frustration with liberal values and anti-establishment sentiment that has galvanized far-right voters in other parts of Europe.
""Remember the shameful slogans of last year's Nov. 11 march?,"" centrist lawmaker Marcin Kierwinski said on Twitter. ""A year later, their authors are meeting with the president and prime minister instead of a prosecutor.""
Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Thursday any ""extremist"" banners would be eliminated from Sunday's event.
The United States embassy in Warsaw issued a security alert ahead of the march.
The defence ministry said a military display including armored vehicles would accompany the march, but said they were not part in any security arrangements.
Before the late-night agreement with the government on Friday to hold a joint event, organizers had said they expected the march to be the biggest far-right event in Europe in years.
Foreign participants who had confirmed their attendance earlier included Milan Mazurek, a Slovak lawmaker who once said on social media that the history of Nazi Germany and the Holocaust had been ""distorted"".
On Nov. 11 Poles commemorate the establishment of the second Polish republic in 1918 from territory seized by its eastern and Western neighbors in the 18th century, made possible by the defeat of Russia, Germany and Austria in World War One.
Also on Sunday, world leaders gather in Paris to mark the end of the war.

The attack is the 78th this year on the 485-mile (780-km) pipeline, which has been out of service for much of 2018 because of bombings and illegal taps.
The pipeline, which can transport up to 210,000 barrels per day, was not functioning at the time of the attack. It was also bombed on Thursday.
The latest bombing took place in Toledo municipality in Norte de Santander (MC:SAN) province, Ecopetrol said on Twitter.
The company did not say who it held responsible, but military sources have blamed previous attacks on the pipeline on fighters from the National Liberation Army (ELN) rebel group.
The ELN, considered a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union, has about 1,500 combatants and opposes multinational companies that its leaders accuse of seizing natural resources without benefiting Colombians.
Colombian President Ivan Duque has demanded the group free all its hostages and cease criminal activities before he will consider restarting peace talks that began last year under his predecessor, Juan Manuel Santos.

QUERETARO, Mexico (Reuters) - Hundreds of Central American migrants resumed their march north through Mexico on Saturday, en route to the U.S. border where President Donald Trump has effectively suspended the granting of asylum to migrants who cross illegally.
Trump's Friday order, which went into effect on Saturday, means that migrants will have to present themselves at U.S. ports of entry to qualify for asylum and follow other rules unveiled on Thursday that seek to limit asylum claims.
""It doesn't matter what rules (Trump's) government imposes we cannot go back to our countries. I have a bullet in my arm and another in my shoulder. If I go back home, it'd be better for me to go with a casket,"" said 30 year-old Julio Caesar from Honduras, who declined to give his last name. 
The caravan, made up mostly of Hondurans, started north again on Saturday morning following a rest of four days in Mexico City.
They carried backpacks, blankets, food, many with children in tow, and took the metro and then walked to the town of Tepotzotlan. There they were helped onto buses and trucks by authorities, who stopped traffic to ask motorists if they would take the migrants to the city of Queretaro, where a shelter was set up at a stadium.
Some of the migrants are set to arrive to the border city of Tijuana on Monday, while others later in the week to Reynosa and other border towns, according to migrant shelters.
""These (U.S.) policies leave migrants even more vulnerable, because they will be stranded in northern Mexico, with human traffickers lurking, because the Mexican government does not have the capacity to help them,"" said Oscar Misael Hernandez, researcher at the Colegio de la Frontera Norte.

Trump made his hard-line policies toward immigration a key issue ahead of Tuesday's midterm elections. He has vowed to deploy troops at the border to stop a caravan of migrants, who say they want to seek asylum in the United States, citing violence in their own countries.

1385,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2018 07:41PM ET</span>","Four UK ministers on verge of quitting, EU rejects latest plan: Sunday Times","LONDON (Reuters) - Four British ministers who back remaining in the European Union are on the verge of quitting Theresa May's government over Brexit, the Sunday Times reported, as pressures built on the prime minister from all sides. 
The newspaper also said that the European Union had rejected May's plan for an independent mechanism to oversee Britain's departure from any temporary customs arrangement it agrees. The newspaper sourced the development to British sources, and not sources in the EU team.
May is trying to hammer out the final details of the British divorce deal but the talks have become stuck over how the two sides can prevent a hard border from being required in Ireland.
Britain has proposed a UK-wide temporary customs arrangement with the EU to resolve the issue but Brexiteers in her party want London to have the final say on when that arrangement would end, to prevent it from being tied indefinitely to the bloc. 
A senior cabinet minister was quoted in the paper as saying: ""This is the moment she has to face down Brussels and make it clear to them that they need to compromise, or we will leave without a deal.""
An EU diplomat told Reuters earlier on Saturday that they were cautiously hopeful that an EU summit could happen in November to endorse the deal but that the volatile situation in Britain made it very difficult to predict. 
Other EU diplomats said several issues remained unresolved. 
May is expected to meet with her cabinet this week to set out her plans for the divorce deal. She was dealt a blow on Friday when junior minister Jo Johnston, who voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, quit over her plan.
To add to the pressure, a leading member of a group of Brexiteer lawmakers in parliament joined with the Brexit spokesman for the small Northern Irish party that props up May's party in government to warn that they could not vote for the deal as it currently stands.
Steve Baker, a former junior Brexit minister who resigned over May's so-called Chequers proposals on Brexit, and Sammy Wilson of the DUP wrote in the Sunday Telegraph newspaper that they could not back a deal if it treated Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the country. 
May had been expected to hold a vote in parliament on her deal before the end of the year. 
A spokeswoman for May's Downing Street office said the talks were going down to the wire. ""The prime minister has always said these negotiations are tough and toughest in the final stages. 
""The prime minister has told colleagues this week we should aim to conclude the withdrawal agreement as soon as possible but we will not do that at any cost.""

COMPIEGNE, France (Reuters) - One hundred years after the guns of World War One fell silent, the leaders of France and Germany held hands and rested their heads against one another in a poignant ceremony to mark the signing of the Armistice peace agreement.
President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel inspected troops from a joint Franco-German Brigade before unveiling a plaque paying tribute to the reconciliation and renewed friendship between the foes of two world wars.
More than 3 million French and German troops were among an estimated 10 million soldiers who died in the Great War of 1914-1918. Much of the heaviest fighting was in trenches in northern France and Belgium.
A German delegation signed the Armistice before sunrise on Nov 11, 1918, in a private train belonging to the commander of French forces, Ferdinand Foch, parked on rail track running through the Compiegne Forest. Hours later, at 11.00 a.m., the war ended.
""Europe has been at peace for 73 years. It is at peace because we want it to be, because Germany and France want peace,"" Macron told several youngsters, with Merkel at his side, referring to the peace since the end of World War Two in 1945.
""And so the message, if we want to live up to the sacrifice of those soldiers who said 'Never again!', is to never yield to our weakest instincts, nor to efforts to divide us.""
Merkel said she was moved by the ceremony and described Macron's invitation as a ""very symbolic gesture.""
In a powerful show of unity, Macron and Merkel sat inside the reconstructed teak-lined rail wagon in which the peace charter was signed and looked through a book of remembrance. After each signed the book, they held hands a second time.
CLOSER EUROPE
The last time French and German delegations had sat in the same place was when Nazi Germany's Adolf Hitler forced the surrender of French authorities after invading in 1940.
Since World War Two, France and Germany have driven tighter European cooperation and the European Union has become the world's largest trading bloc.
Macron, 40, an ardent defender of a closer Europe, has turned to Merkel to help him forge deeper economic integration within the EU's single currency bloc, as well as more collaboration on matters such as defense and immigration.
For years, Merkel, 64, had waited for a French leader with Macron's zest for Europe. But the fragility of her governing coalition and her own weakened leadership, as well as misgivings over aspects of Macron's vision for renewal, have meant she has not moved as quickly as Macron would have liked.
This past week, the French leader has toured sites that once lay along the western front, from the battlefields of Verdun in the east to the imposing Thiepval memorial overlooking the Somme valley. There, he and British Prime Minister Theresa May together laid a wreath on Friday.
Along the way, he has warned of the rising threat to Europe posed by a resurgence in nationalism.

""Nationalism is rising across Europe, the nationalism that demands the closing of frontiers, which preaches rejection of the other,"" he said in a radio interview on Tuesday. ""It is playing on fears, everywhere. Europe is increasingly fractured.”

MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (Reuters) - Nigeria has named its fifth commander in less than 2 years to lead the fight against the Boko Haram insurgency, the army said on Saturday, a move military sources say was related to continued attacks by Islamists.
The attacks could hurt President Muhammadu Buhari's chances of re-election in Feb. 2019. He campaigned in 2015 vowing to end the insurgency but the conflict is entering its 10th year with attacks by Boko Haram and a group that splintered from it, the Islamic State in West Africa (ISWA).
Major General Abba Dikko, who in July took over command of Operation Lafiya Dole, has been replaced as the head of that operation by Major General Benson Akinroluyo, the army said in an emailed statement that outlined dozens of redeployments.
Dikko has been moved to the Department of Civil Military Affairs to fill the position of chief of civil military affairs.
""The Nigerian Army has redeployed some of its officers from Operation Lafiya Dole, Operation Delta Safe, as well as over stayed officers from the theater as part of routine posting,"" the army said in the statement. 
Two military officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he was redeployed because of attacks by Islamists since he took over. 
Since July, when Dikko was appointed, dozens of Nigerian troops have been killed in battles with militants and ISWA killed two abducted aid workers.
Soldiers also staged a protest at an airport in September.
An army spokesman did not immediately respond to text messages and phone calls seeking further details on the decision to replace Dikko as the head of the fight against Islamists just months after he took the role.

Asked about reports of air strikes in that area on Friday, the coalition's spokesman said it had ""successfully struck and destroyed an ISIS (Islamic State) observation post and staging area in Hajin, void of civilians at the time"".
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 41 people, including 17 children, had been killed in two waves of coalition air strikes on Friday in Hajin and the nearby village of al-Shafa on the eastern bank of the Euphrates River.
It said the casualties were mostly Iraqi and family members of Islamic State fighters.
The coalition is supporting the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in an attempt to defeat Islamic State in the area it controls near the border with Iraq.
Syrian state media said the foreign ministry had written to the U.N. secretary general and the president of the security council about ""the crime"" in Hajin.

1391,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2018 12:18PM ET</span>","Turkey gave Khashoggi tapes to European nations, Erdogan says","By Ezgi Erkoyun
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey has given recordings related to the killing of Jamal Khashoggi to Germany, France and Britain, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday, seeking to maintain international pressure on Riyadh over the Saudi journalist's death.
Khashoggi, a critic of de facto Saudi ruler Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed in Saudi Arabia's Istanbul consulate last month in a hit which Erdogan says was ordered at the ""highest levels"" of the Saudi government.
His killing provoked global outrage but little concrete action by world powers against Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter and a supporter of Washington's plans to contain Iranian influence across the Middle East.
Speaking as he left Turkey to attend World War One commemorations in France alongside President Donald Trump and European leaders, Erdogan said for the first time that the three European Union states had heard the recordings.
""We gave the tapes. We gave them to Saudi Arabia, to the United States, Germans, French and British, all of them. They have listened to all the conversations in them. They know,"" Erdogan said.
CIA director Gina Haspel heard an audio recording of Khashoggi's death when she visited Istanbul, two sources told Reuters last month. A senior Saudi envoy was also played a recording, a source said. 
Erdogan did not give details of the contents of the tapes on Saturday but two sources with knowledge of the issue have told Reuters that Turkey has several audio recordings. 
They include the killing itself and conversations pre-dating the operation which Turkey subsequently uncovered, the sources said. These had led Ankara to conclude from an early stage that the killing was premeditated, despite Saudi Arabia's initial denials of any knowledge or involvement.
Saudi Arabia's prosecutor Saud al-Mojeb has since said Khashoggi's killing was planned in advance, although another Saudi official said Prince Mohammed had no knowledge of the specific operation.
One source familiar with the recordings said that officials who heard them had been horrified by their contents. One of Prince Mohammed's top aides, Saud al-Qahtani, featured prominently in them throughout, sources said.
Last month two separate intelligence sources told Reuters Qahtani gave orders over Skype to Khashoggi's killers at the consulate. Qahtani did not respond to questions from Reuters at the time. Saudi state media said King Salman sacked him and four other officials over the killing. There was no indication that any of the suspects were detained. 
WHO KILLED KHASHOGGI?
Erdogan did not repeat on Saturday his accusation that the operation was ordered by Saudi leaders. However, he called on Riyadh to identify the killer, saying it must have been a member of a team that arrived in Turkey hours before Khashoggi's disappearance.
""There's no need to distort this issue, they know for certain that the killer, or the killers, is among these 15 people. Saudi Arabia's government can disclose this by making these 15 people talk,"" Erdogan said.
Erdogan also accused Mojeb - who visited Istanbul to discuss the investigation with his Turkish counterpart and inspect the Istanbul consulate - of refusing to cooperate. ""The prosecutor came to Turkey to make excuses, make things difficult,"" he said.
During his visit, Mojeb revealed no information to Turkish authorities, a source said, but instead asked for Khashoggi's mobile phones which the journalist had left with his fiancee before entering the consulate. 
Erdogan repeated a demand for information on the whereabouts of Khashoggi's body. An adviser to the president has said the body was cut up for disposal, and Vice President Fuat Oktay has called for an investigation into reports that it was then dissolved in acid. 
A Turkish official said last week that Saudi Arabia sent two people, a chemist and a toxicologist, to Istanbul a week after Khashoggi's Oct. 2 killing to erase evidence, calling it a sign that top Saudi officials knew of the crime.
Saudi Arabia has said members of the team which was sent to Istanbul, and returned shortly after the killing, have been arrested along with three others.
Following a meeting on Saturday in Paris, Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed that Saudi authorities needed to shed full light on Khashoggi's murder, a French presidency source said.

They also agreed that the matter should not be allowed to cause further destabilization in the Middle East and that it could create an opportunity to find a political resolution to the war in Yemen, according to the official.

The 270-km (167-mile) high-speed line is due to link the French city of Lyon with Turin in northern Italy at an estimated cost of 26 billion euros ($30.2 billion).
The plan has been beset by disapproval and protests, both regional and national, and in July Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, leader of the 5-Star and industry minister, called for a review, putting his group at odds with coalition partner the League. 
Around 30,000 people gathered in one of Turin's main squares for what was the biggest pro-TAV demonstration so far, signaling the plan's economic importance in one of Italy's most industrialized regions.
""It's yes, to economic development, to jobs, tourism and culture and all that is important to the city,"" said Adele Olivero, one of the organizers of the rally, which gathered citizens, labor unions, parties as well as TAV workers. 
Regional Governor Sergio Chiamparino called for a quick response from the government: ""Turin and (the region) of Piedmont want the TAV, and they want a link with Europe, without barriers,"" he said.
Chiara Appendino, 5-Star mayor of the city, said she accepted the arguments put forward by the protestors and that she was ready to ""open a constructive dialogue."" 
Work has already started on the project but Italy's Infrastructure Minister said he wanted to re-negotiate the terms with France. If Italy backs out at this point, it could face large penalties from both Paris and Brussels. 
The 5-Star has long supported the cause of residents of the alpine valleys who have protested against TAV. 
Meanwhile the League, whose support is mainly rooted in the regions of the north, has defended the project, saying it will help develop the Italian economy.

5-Star, afraid to lose a large slice of its electoral support, is keen to stop works on TAV, one of its biggest election promises, particularly after having to grant approval last month to the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) project, which it had highly contested and had pledged to stop.

In a televised speech on Saturday, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah also warned Israel that his Iranian-backed group would respond to any attack on Lebanon and urged his country to withstand diplomatic pressure over its rocket arsenal.
Hezbollah's demand for one of its Sunni allies be given a portfolio in the new Lebanese government is at the heart of a row that has obstructed a final agreement six months since a parliamentary election.
The formation of a new government is necessary before any moves can be made towards fiscal reforms which the International Monetary Fund said in June are needed immediately to improve debt sustainability.
Hezbollah says one of its Sunni allies must be represented in the government to reflect their election gains.
But Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri, who is Lebanon's main Sunni politician and enjoys Western backing, has ruled out allocating any of his cabinet seats to them.
Lebanon's political system requires government positions to be allotted along sectarian lines.
Nasrallah said rejecting a Sunni ally from its ""March 8"" camp amounted to exclusion of a section of Lebanese.
""We were sincere when we spoke of a national unity government. There is no national logic, or moral logic, or legal logic ... for anyone in Lebanon to come out and say 'it is forbidden for the March 8 Sunnis to be represented in the Lebanese government,"" Nasrallah said.
""If it is forbidden, come let's talk again from the start,"" he said, adding: ""We don't want conflict, or tension, or escalation.""
President Michel Aoun vowed earlier on Saturday to find a solution to the problem. Though a political ally of Hezbollah, Aoun has sided with Hariri in the row.
Hezbollah, groups and individuals that support its possession of weapons won more than 70 of the 128 seats in the May 6 parliamentary election.
Hezbollah is proscribed as a terrorist group by the United States. The group last fought a major conflict with Israel in 2006, since when it has grown militarily stronger as a major participant in the Syrian war.
Nasrallah said Israel had recently tried to increase pressure over the group's rocket arsenal and to create ""a state of intimidation and threat that if this matter is not dealt with, it (Israel) will deal with it"". Israel had used ""the Americans and even some European states"" in this effort, he said.
""I say to Lebanon that it must bear this level of diplomatic pressure,"" Nasrallah said. ""Any attack on Lebanon, any air strikes on Lebanon or bombardment - we will certainly respond,"" he said

ROME (Reuters) - An Italian judge on Saturday acquitted Rome mayor Virginia Raggi of false testimony in a trial over a senior job appointment within city hall, defusing a possible crisis for her party, the ruling 5-Star movement. 
Raggi was elected mayor in 2016 in a vote that was seen at the time as a major breakthrough for the 5-Star, which has always promoted a squeaky clean image and promised to clean up the corruption-riddled Italian capital.
The 40-year old mayor was accused of lying about her involvement in the nomination of the director of the city's tourism department, Renato Marra, brother of one of her closest aides. Prosecutors had asked for a 10-month prison sentence.
""This sentence clears away two years of mud slinging. We will now go ahead, with our head held high, for Rome, my beloved city, and for its citizens,"" Raggi said on Twitter.
The judge said Raggi was not guilty because she was either not aware she was committing a crime or did not know the real facts surrounding Marra's appointment.
Raggi hugged her husband and city councillors standing with her in the courtroom after the judge read out the verdict. 
The 5-Star code of ethics says its elected officials have to resign if they are convicted, meaning Raggi would have had to step down if the ruling had gone against her, throwing city hall into chaos and leaving her party open to ridicule.
Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, who is also leader of the 5-Star, said Raggi had been ""massacred"" and accused journalists of being ""worthless jackals"" for suggesting in their reports that his party dump Raggi.
""The true plague of this country is the majority of the media, intellectually and morally corrupt, which is waging war against the government, trying to make it fall,"" Di Maio added on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Raggi's many critics say she has made little if any progress since taking office in resolving Rome's myriad problems, including a decrepit transport network, pot-holed roads and an inefficient garbage service. 
Thousands of people staged a demonstration in front of city hall last month, denouncing the ragged state of the city, but Raggi dismissed the protesters and said she was making good headway in her job.

Over 2 million Rome citizens will be called on Sunday to vote in a referendum to decide whether the city's public transport services, run by a municipality-owned and bankrupt company, should be opened up to other companies.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - As pollution in India's capital hit ""severe"" on the air quality scale on Saturday, the New Delhi chief minister came under fire following reports he had left the city for an overseas family trip.
For a second year the chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, has likened Delhi to a ""gas chamber"" because of the pollution.
Seasonal burning of crop stubble and smoke from fireworks let off to celebrate the Hindu festival of Diwali on Nov. 7 have aggravated already high smog levels in the past few days from vehicle emissions, industrial gases and construction work.
(Graphic: For a window into Delhi's pollution click https://tmsnrt.rs/2PiM0Ut)
Local television news channels said Kejriwal had left the country on a private family trip to Dubai, triggering a backlash on social media and finger pointing on Twitter by the Delhi arm of India's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the party of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
""Arvind Kejriwal cares about his family so much that he urgently booked tickets and ran away to Dubai with them as soon as Delhi started choking with pollution,"" said one Twitter user.
A member of Kejriwal's party, the Aam Aadmi (Common Man) Party (AAP), told Reuters that the chief minister was not in the city. He declined to elaborate or be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the media.
A city government spokesman did not respond to telephone calls seeking comment.
Neither the governing party at federal level nor the main opposition are in power in the capital, giving them little incentive to co-operate with city authorities.
Environmental activists say residents need to be more vocal about holding political leaders to account over the pollution.
""Public pressure has to be much sharper and demand compliance. Directions, policies have been issued but stringent implementation is needed,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury, an executive director at the Centre for Science and Environment, a think-tank.
Still, there is little sign in Delhi that residents are doing much to protect themselves from the smog. Activists say the apparent lack of concern about the pollution gives federal and local politicians the cover they need for failing to adequately address the problem.
The Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority has banned all construction activity and ordered use of sprinklers in the city until Nov. 10, among other measures. On Saturday, it indicated the measures would be extended until Monday.
The city government has banned heavy vehicles from entering Delhi until Sunday and it was not clear if that order would be extended. It had also urged drivers to avoid using private diesel-powered vehicles until Saturday, but there has been no ban.
Measures of tiny poisonous particulate matter, or PM 2.5 particles less than 2.5 microns in diameter, reached an average of 401 across Delhi at 1600 IST (1030 GMT), the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) said.
That touches the ""severe"" category between 401-500, defined by the CPCB as bad air that can seriously impact those with existing health conditions, such as asthma, and can affect healthy people.

The capital's pollution hit emergency levels on Thursday, according to the U.S. embassy. It followed Wednesday's Diwali celebrations, when revelers let off fireworks.

While politicians have often warned of the risk of an economic crisis in Lebanon, public expressions of concern for the currency are rare. Lebanon is experiencing stagnant economic growth and has the world's third largest public debt to GDP ratio.

Central bank governor Riad Salameh has repeatedly said the Lebanese pound, pegged at 1,507.5 to the dollar for two decades, is stable and not at risk, helped by the central bank's high foreign currency reserves.

The restoration of sanctions is part of a wider effort by U.S. President Donald Trump to force Iran to curb its nuclear and missile programs as well as its support for proxy forces in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and other parts of the Middle East.
""The sanctions have had no impact on our economy because America had already used all the weapons at its disposal and there was nothing new to use against us,"" Rouhani said in remarks carried live on state television.
""They just issued a long list of banks, their branches ... and airlines and their planes. And this shows that they are merely trying to affect the Iranian nation psychologically,"" Rouhani said.
The United States said it would temporarily allow eight importers to keep buying Iranian oil when it reimposed sanctions last Monday aimed at forcing Tehran to curb its nuclear, missile and regional activities.
""It has now become clear that America cannot cut Iran's oil exports to zero,"" Rouhani added, speaking after a weekly meeting with the heads of the parliament and the judiciary.

In May, Trump exited Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with six powers and Washington reimposed a first round of sanctions on Iran in August.

The Turkish army uses the phrase neutralize when it has killed, captured or wounded combatants.
The air strikes carried out on Friday targeted the Gara, Zap and Avasin-Basyan regions of northern Iraq, Turkish military said, adding that the militants were believed to be preparing to carry out an attack.
""Fifteen armed members of the separatist terror organisation, who were in preparations for an attack to military bases, were neutralised, hideouts and armories were destroyed by air strikes carried out on Nov. 9,"" the military said, using the term it applies to the PKK.
Turkey regularly carries out air strikes against PKK targets in northern Iraq, where the group is based in the Qandil mountains.
The PKK, considered a terrorist organization by the United States, the European Union and Turkey, has waged a three-decade insurgency in Turkey's largely Kurdish southeast that has killed some 40,000 people.

The hemorrhagic fever is believed to have killed 198 people in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, where attacks by armed groups and community resistance to health officials have complicated the response. 
Congo has suffered 10 Ebola outbreaks since the virus was discovered near the eponymous Ebola River in 1976.
""The current epidemic is the worst in the history of DRC,"" Jessica Ilunga, a spokeswoman for the ministry told Reuters.
With over 300 cases the epidemic also ranks as third worst in the history of the continent, following the 2013-2016 outbreak in West Africa where over 28,000 cases were confirmed and an outbreak in Uganda in 2000 involving 425 cases.
World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Thursday that security represented the primary challenge in the current epidemic, followed by community mistrust.
""When there is an attack, the operation actually freezes. So we hold the operation. And when the operation stops, the virus gets advantage and it affects us in two ways,"" he told reporters in Kinshasa.
""And one is catching up on the backload. Because when operations are stopped, there is always a backload of vaccinations, or contact tracing. And the other, the second problem, is that more cases are generated because we can't vaccinate them,"" he said.

The confirmation of new cases has accelerated in the last month and an emergency committee of World Health Organization experts said in October that the outbreak was likely to worsen significantly unless the response was stepped up.

""There is nowhere left to search and we have stopped finding victims' bodies,"" Muhammad Syaugi, the head of the national search and rescue agency (Basarnas) told media. ""We will limit our operations to monitoring.""
The nearly new Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. 737 MAX passenger plane crashed into the sea on Oct. 29 just minutes after taking off from Jakarta en route to Bangka island near Sumatra.
Syaugi said 196 body bags containing human remains had been retrieved and 77 victims identified after forensic examination.
Authorities have downloaded data from one of the black boxes found last week, the flight data recorder, but are still looking for the cockpit voice recorder.
Soearjanto Tjahjono, the head of the transportation safety committee (KNKT), said finding the voice recorder would be critical to understanding the cause of the crash.
""From the black box data, we know about 70-80 percent of what happened but to 100-percent understand the cause of the accident... we need be able to know the conversation that took place in the plane's cockpit,"" he said, declining to elaborate on what the flight data recorder had revealed.
KNKT has brought in a pinger locator and a vessel capable of sucking up mud to help with the search for the voice recorder, in addition to remotely operated underwater vehicles equipped with cameras.
Tjahjono said he was worried the cockpit voice recorder may have been damaged on impact because KNKT had yet to detect any ""ping"" sounds that would indicate its location, as had happened with the first black box.
He said authorities were searching for 15 aircraft parts, including an ""angle of attack"" sensor on the aircraft, which helps the plane's computers understand if the aircraft is stable. Investigators have said one of these sensors had provided erroneous data.

KNKT told Reuters on Wednesday that there was a problem with the sensor on the previous flight taken by the doomed plane from the island of Bali to Jakarta. One sensor had been replaced in Bali.

The junior transport minister - and younger brother of former foreign minister Boris Johnson - issued a searing critique of May's Brexit deal on Friday when he unexpectedly quit, saying the country needed to pull back from the brink and have a second referendum on leaving the EU.
Jo Johnson had previously voted to remain in the bloc, and his departure risks galvanizing other pro-EU ministers to oppose May's deal, alongside the Brexiteers within the ruling party who have already said they will not vote for the plan. 
""I know many are reflecting hard about the deal that's looming and how they will respond to it, but it's obviously for each of them to work out how best to respond,"" he told BBC Radio. 
""This is one of the most momentous questions we will ever face in our political careers. It's up to (lawmakers) to take a stand. I've done so, if others feel that it's right for them to do so then good on them."" 
Johnson said there was now a huge gulf between the type of Brexit that was promised by his brother Boris, a leading campaigner to leave the EU, and the deal that May is hammering out in Brussels. 
As a result, he said it would be a ""democratic travesty"" if the government did not consult the public on whether they still wanted to leave the world's largest trading bloc. 

Jacob Rees-Mogg, a leading Brexiteer in May's party, told BBC Radio he rejected the call for another referendum but agreed with the criticism of the deal. He said in its current form it would not have enough Conservative support to get through a vote in parliament.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has rejected a Singapore government request to remove a post of an online article that the government said was ""false and malicious"", prompting its Law Ministry to say the case illustrated the need to introduce legislation to stop fake news.
Singapore's central bank said on Friday it had filed a police report against an online article by an Australia-based independent blogger about Singapore banks and Malaysia's scandal-linked 1MDB state fund.
Web access in Singapore to the website of the States Times Review (STR) has been blocked by internet service providers as directed by Singapore's telecom and media regulator IMDA, which said it had determined the website carried prohibited content.
""IMDA has assessed that the article undermined public confidence in the integrity of the Singapore Government and is objectionable on grounds of public interest,"" Infocommm Media Development Authority (IMDA) said in a statement.
STR articles on its Facebook page remained available.
The IMDA asked Facebook to take down a post of the article but ""Facebook has indicated that they will not accede to IMDA's request"", it said in a separate statement on Saturday.
Facebook declined to comment.
Singapore's Ministry of Law said ""Facebook has declined to take down a post that is clearly false, defamatory and attacks Singapore, using falsehoods"", which illustrated the need to introduce legislation fighting fake news.
""FB (Facebook) cannot be relied upon to filter falsehoods or protect Singapore from a false information campaign,"" it said in a statement.
Singapore's parliament has been debating measures to tackle the threat of fake news including introducing legislation.
The States Times Review was founded and is run by a Singaporean political activist Alex Tan, who is based in Australia. It carries articles that are critical of Singapore's leaders and its ruling People's Action Party.
Tan said in a post on his Facebook page late on Friday that he had decided to suspend activities on the website because ""it lost a channel to reach Singaporeans"".
He also said he would stop writing and his Facebook page would shut down in two weeks, but the move was not because of pressure from the Singapore government.
Tan could not be reached for comment.
Phil Robertson, Asia's deputy director of Human Rights Watch, which has been critical of Singapore's laws limiting critical speech and peaceful assembly, said the Singapore government was engaged in bullying tactics against STR.
""If a story is inaccurate, Singapore should refute it with facts, not shoot the messenger. Actions like these show that when it comes to media freedom, Singapore is no better than repressive regimes like Vietnam or Laos,"" Robertson said.
The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said the article was ""false and malicious, and impugned the integrity of MAS as a financial regulator.""
""The article is baseless and defamatory,"" MAS said.
Malaysian state fund 1Malaysian Development Berhad (1MDB) is at the center of various international investigations into missing funds. The U.S. Justice Department says an estimated $4.5 billion was misappropriated from the fund by high-level 1MDB officials between 2009 and 2014.
Former Prime Minister Najib Razak, ousted in an election in May, faces multiple corruption charges in Malaysia in relation to the investigation. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing.
The MAS has fined both domestic and foreign banks following a two-year probe for breaching anti-money laundering laws in connection to 1MDB transactions and shut down the local units of two banks.

It has also issued prohibition orders against several people linked to the case.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka President Maithripala Sirisena's decision to dissolve parliament, worsening an already major political crisis, has drawn criticism from Western powers, including the United States and Britain.
Sirisena dissolved parliament on Friday night, only five days before it was due to reconvene and he was in danger of losing a vote of no confidence. He has also called a general election for Jan. 5. 
The president triggered an intense power struggle when he sacked prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe late last month and appointed the island's former leader, Mahinda Rajapaksa, a pro-China strongman ousted by Sirisena in 2015, in his place.
Sirisena's rivals are set to challenge his decision, which they describe as illegal and unconstitutional, in the Supreme Court on Monday. 
The U.S. Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs said in a tweet that the United States was ""deeply concerned by news the Sri Lanka Parliament will be dissolved, further deepening the political crisis"". It said democracy needed to be respected to ensure stability and prosperity.
Mark Field, the British minister of State for Asia and the Pacific, tweeted his concern about the dissolution of parliament days before it was due to be reconvened.
""As a friend of Sri Lanka, the UK calls on all parties to uphold the constitution and respect democratic institutions and processes,"" Field said.
Canada's Foreign Policy twitter feed said that it was ""deeply concerned"" about the decision and referred to the risks to reconciliation work after the nation's civil war.
""This further political uncertainty is corrosive to Sri Lanka’s democratic future and its commitments on reconciliation and accountability,"" it said.
Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Marise Payne expressed both concern and disappointment in a statement, saying the move ""undermines Sri Lanka's long democratic tradition and poses a risk to its stability and prosperity"".
Sirisena has said he fired Wickremesinghe because the prime minister was trying to implement ""a new, extreme liberal political concept by giving more priority for foreign policies and neglecting the local people's sentiment"".
India and the West have raised concerns over Rajapaksa's close ties with China. Beijing loaned Sri Lanka billions of dollars for infrastructure projects when Rajapaksa was president between 2005-2015, putting the country deep into debt.
Wickremesinghe refused to vacate the official prime minister's residence saying he was the prime minister and had a parliamentary majority.
Before he signed the papers dissolving parliament and calling the election, Sirisena appointed allies of his and of Rajapaksa to cabinet positions. 
Independent legal experts have told Reuters that parliament could be dissolved only in early 2020, which would be four-and-half-years from the first sitting of the current parliament. The only other legal way would be through a referendum, or with the consent of two thirds of lawmakers. 

Given those views, it was not immediately clear how Sirisena is on legal safe ground by dissolving parliament, though his legal experts have said there are provisions for him to do so.

Sisto Malaspina, 74, a familiar face behind the coffee machine at the city-center Pellegrini's cafe, was killed in the attack on Friday, his business partner Nino Pangrazio told The Age newspaper. 
""Many, many tears have been shed,"" Pangrazio said.
Police have not confirmed his identity, only saying a 74-year-old city worker was killed by a Somali-born man who set fire to a truck laden with gas cylinders just outside the cafe before stabbing three bystanders.
The two others were wounded.
Pellegrini's, a cosy corner bar with 50s-style checkerboard tiles on the floor, was closed on Saturday but dozens of customers gathered outside, leaving flowers and tributes on the doorstep. The phone rang out when Reuters called.
""Sisto, il mio cuore si spezza,"" Oscar-winning actor Russell Crowe wrote on Twitter, using the Italian for ""my heart breaks.""
""I've been going to Pellegrini's since 1987. Never been to Melbourne without dropping in on my man,"" Crowe wrote, one of many celebrities to pay their tributes.
An Italian immigrant, Malaspina took over the cafe with Pangrazio in 1974, Pangrazio says in a Melbourne City Council video from 2014 that features the famous coffee house.
They have hardly changed a thing about it since - serving espresso coffee and fresh pasta that Malaspina said in the video learned to cook from his grandmother. 
""Pellegrini's has witnessed a lot of change over its 60-odd years – but embraced very little of it,"" Hospitality Magazine said in a 2017 profile. ""This is the way food should be done. It's not contemporary food. It's secular, traditional, home cooking,"" Malaspina is quoted as saying in the article.
""Everyone on this end of the city knew him,"" Brendan Nottle, who has worked in an office across the street for two decades, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

""He had huge personality. He was always up and about, almost theatrical, in Pellegrini's. He was a guy with a great heart,"" he said, adding his death leaves a ""massive hole"" in the community.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - An Australian man who set fire to a truck laden with gas cylinders in the center of Melbourne and stabbed one person to death was inspired by Islamic State but did not have direct links with the group, police said on Saturday.
Police identified the man responsible for Friday's attack as Somali-born Hassan Khalif Shire Ali, 30, and said he was radicalized and inspired by the militant group's propaganda. He was shot by police and died in hospital.
Police said Shire Ali's Australian passport was canceled in 2015 after an intelligence report he planned to travel to Syria, but an assessment was made that while he had radical views, he posed no threat to national security.
Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, which came two days before Remembrance Day, marking 100 years since the end of World War One, without providing any evidence. 
""I think it is fair to say he (Shire Ali) was inspired. He was radicalized,"" Australian Federal Police Acting Deputy Commissioner Ian McCartney told reporters in Melbourne. 
""We're not saying there was direct contact. We're saying it was more from an inspiration perspective.""
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the national terrorism advisory remained at ""probable"", the midpoint of a five-tier system, and told reporters in Sydney that radical Islam was the issue.
""I need to call it out. Radical, violent, extremist Islam that opposes our very way of life. I am the first to protect religious freedom in this country, but that also means I must be the first to call out religious extremism,"" he said.
CAFE OWNER MOURNED
Friday's attack began just before the evening rush hour and lasted only minutes. Shire Ali stabbed bystanders and attacked police while his utility truck carrying barbecue gas cylinders burned on busy Bourke Street. (https://tmsnrt.rs/2Qu5stX)
The cylinders did not explode and the fire was put out in 10 minutes, by which point the attack was over, though not before one man was fatally stabbed.
Police said he was a 74-year-old man who worked in the city, and did not release his name.
The man's business partner identified him as Sisto Malaspina, co-owner of Pellegrini's cafe, a Melbourne institution credited with forging the city's famous coffee culture.
""Many, many tears have been shed,"" the cafe's co-owner. Nino Pangrazio, told The Age newspaper, and customers laid flowers and written tributes outside the cafe on Saturday. 
""This shouldn't happen in a city like Melbourne,"" one witness who had returned to the scene on Saturday told Reuters, crying. ""I just want to forget it,"" she said.
Video posted to Twitter and broadcast on television showed Shire Ali swinging a knife at two police officers, while the truck burned in the background, before he collapsed when one shot him in the chest. 
Victoria state police said counter-terrorism investigators were searching two properties in suburban Melbourne in connection with the attack, but there was no immediate word on what the searches yielded.
At one, a modest one-story brick house on the city's western fringe, armed officers wearing masks stood guard outside. Bourke Street also reopened on Saturday and a Reuters reporter said there was an increased police presence in the area.
A staunch U.S. ally, Australia has been on alert for such violence after a Sydney cafe siege in 2014, and its intelligence agencies have stepped up scrutiny. Victoria Police Commissioner Graham Ashton said there was no warning of the latest attack.
He said there was no longer a threat to the public, but that security would be boosted at horse races and Remembrance Day memorials over the weekend.
Authorities say Australia's vigilance has helped foil at least a dozen plots, including a plan to attack Melbourne at Christmas in 2016 and a plan to blow up a flight from Sydney to Abu Dhabi using a bomb disguised as a meat mincer. 

Two hostages were killed during the 17-hour Sydney cafe siege by a ""lone wolf"" gunman who was inspired by Islamic State militants.

WASHINGTON/CAIRO (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and the United States have agreed to end U.S. refueling of aircraft from the Saudi-led coalition battling Houthi insurgents in Yemen, ending a divisive aspect of U.S. support to a war that has pushed Yemen to the brink of famine.
The move, announced by the coalition on Saturday and confirmed by Washington, comes at a time when Riyadh, already under scrutiny for civilian deaths in Yemen air strikes, is facing global furor and potential sanctions over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at its Istanbul consulate on Oct. 2.
The United States and Britain late last month called for a ceasefire in Yemen to support U.N.-led efforts to end the nearly four-year long war that has killed more than 10,000 people and triggered the world's most urgent humanitarian crisis.
""Recently, the Kingdom and the Coalition increased its capability to independently conduct inflight refueling in Yemen. As a result, in consultation with the United States, the Coalition has requested the cessation of inflight refueling support for its operations in Yemen,"" it said in a statement.
Saudi Arabia has a fleet of 23 planes for refueling operations, including six Airbus 330 MRTT used for Yemen, while the United Arab Emirates has six of the Airbus planes, Saudi-owned Al Arabiya al-Hadath channel reported on Saturday.
Riyadh also has nine KC-130 Hercules aircraft that can be used, it added.
U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the U.S. government was consulted on the decision and that Washington supported the move while continuing to work with the alliance to minimize civilian casualties and expand humanitarian efforts.
Any co-ordinated decision by Washington and Riyadh could be an attempt to forestall action threatened in Congress next week by lawmakers over refueling operations.
However, a halt to refueling could have little practical effect on the conflict, seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Only a fifth of coalition aircraft require in-air refueling from the United States, U.S. officials said.
BATTLE FOR HODEIDAH
The Sunni Muslim alliance led by Saudi Arabia and the UAE has recently stepped up military operations against the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement, including in the main port city of Hodeidah, which is a lifeline for millions of Yemenis.
""The continued escalation of attacks ... by the U.S.-Saudi-Emirati coalition confirms that the American calls for a cease-fire are nothing but empty talk,"" Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, head of the group's supreme revolutionary committee, wrote in a column published by the Washington Post on Friday.
He said the ceasefire call was an attempt ""to save face after the humiliation"" caused by the murder of Washington Post columnist Khashoggi, a critic of Saudi policy, that has strained Riyadh's relationship with the West.
Hodeidah has become a key battleground in the war in which the coalition intervened in 2015 to restore the internationally recognized government ousted by the Houthis.
U.N. bodies warn that an all-out attack on the Red Sea port, an entry point for 80 percent of Yemen's food imports and aid relief, could trigger a famine in the impoverished country.
The World Food Programme said on Thursday it planned to double food assistance for Yemen, aiming to reach up to 14 million people ""to avert mass starvation"".
Air strikes by the coalition, which relies on Western arms and intelligence, have often hit schools, hospitals and markets, killing thousands of Yemeni civilians.
U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths hopes to convene Yemen's warring parties for peace talks by the end of the year.
The coalition expressed hope in its statement that his efforts would lead to a negotiated settlement, including an end to Houthi missile attacks that have targeted Saudi cities and vessels off the port of Hodeidah.
Mattis said all parties support Griffiths' efforts.
""The U.S. and the Coalition are planning to collaborate on building up legitimate Yemeni forces to defend the Yemeni people, secure their country's borders, and contribute to counter Al Qaeda and ISIS efforts in Yemen and the region,"" he said in a statement.
The last round of peace talks in Geneva in September collapsed when the Houthis failed to show up, saying their delegation had been prevented from traveling. The Yemeni government blamed the group for trying to sabotage the talks.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The leader of the opposition in Australia's most populous state was replaced on Saturday after he resigned over a #MeToo row sparked by alleged inappropriate behavior.
Former New South Wales (NSW) state Labor party leader Luke Foley resigned on Thursday after being accused of sexually harassing an ABC journalist, four months before a state election he had been in a position to win.
Foley denies the allegations and said he has hired lawyers to sue for defamation over the claims.
NSW Labor deputy leader Michael Daley defeated opposition water spokesman Chris Minns to win the vacant leadership in a caucus meeting on Saturday afternoon.
He promised to build his government on four pillars: investing in schools and hospitals, lowering the cost of living and lowering energy bills.
""We will make Sydney more livable, and stop the unfairness 
and overdevelopment in the planning system,"" he told reporters in Sydney.
Daley also said his party would re-task $2.2 billion earmarked by the state's conservative Liberal government to upgrade sporting stadiums to instead train young people for employment.
Daley will lead NSW Labor to the March 23 election in Australia's largest state, but despite Foley's resignation the scandal is likely to dent Labor's chance of winning power.
A ReachTel poll in September had Labor and the ruling conservative coalition running neck-and-neck in the state.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Standing side by side, top U.S. officials urged their Chinese counterparts on Friday to halt militarization of the disputed South China Sea, drawing a rebuke from the Chinese for sending U.S. warships close to islands claimed by Beijing.
During a round of high-level talks in Washington, the two sides aired in sometimes blunt terms many of their main differences, including a bitter trade dispute, freedom of navigation in Asia-Pacific waters, self-ruled Taiwan, and China’s crackdown on its Muslim minority in Xinjiang.
Two visiting senior Chinese officials also seized the opportunity to warn publicly that a trade war between the world’s two largest economies would end up hurting both sides and to call for keeping channels of communication open to resolve an issue that has unsettled global financial markets.
Despite the airing of grievances, the talks appeared aimed at controlling the damage to relations that has worsened in recent months and at paving the way for an encounter between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 summit in Argentina at the end of November.
""The United States is not pursuing a Cold War or containment policy with respect to China,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told a joint news conference.
Even as the United States and China confront difficult challenges, “cooperation remains essential on many issues,” he said, citing efforts to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear program.
The meeting paired Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis with Chinese Politburo member Yang Jiechi and Defense Minister Wei Fenghe. The annual U.S.-China Diplomatic and Security Dialogue was originally set for Beijing last month but had been called off amid rising tensions.
Pompeo took aim at China over its continued building of military installations on artificial islands and reefs in the South China Sea, where China insists it has sovereignty despite competing claims from some smaller neighbors.
“We have continued concerns about China's activities and militarization in the South China Sea,” Pompeo said following the talks. “We pressed China to live up to its past commitments in this area.""
Yang said China was committed to ""non-confrontation” but that Beijing had the right to build ""necessary defense facilities"" on what it considers its own territory and urged Washington to stop sending warships and military planes close to the islands that Beijing claims.
Mattis made clear that this demand go unheeded by Washington, which insists it is acting under international law to preserve access for it and others to the South China Sea.
In a statement on Saturday, China's Foreign Ministry described the talks as ""frank, constructive and very fruitful."" 
TAIWAN
Responding sharply to Pompeo's mention of Taiwan, which China considers a wayward province but which is armed by Washington, Wei said Beijing would defend its claim on the island ""at any cost.""
But Wei and Mattis agreed on the need to lower U.S.-China military tensions to avoid unintended clashes, with the Chinese general saying confrontation ""will spell disaster to all."" Washington has protested to Beijing about recent behavior by its warships that the U.S. Navy considered unsafe.
While Pompeo spoke little about trade in his public comments, Yang said he hoped the two sides would find a mutually acceptable solution on the issue “before long.”
China and the United States have slapped tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other's goods, jolting global financial markets, and Trump has threatened to set tariffs on the remainder of China's $500 billion-plus exports to the United States if the trade dispute cannot be resolved.
Trump's administration has also accused China of meddling in U.S. politics ahead of this week’s congressional elections, charges China strongly denies.
Reflecting growing U.S. concerns about the Chinese cyber threat, a senior U.S. intelligence official on Thursday accused China of violating a 2015 agreement aimed at stopping cyber espionage through the hacking of government and corporate data.
Pompeo also reiterated U.S. criticism of China's ""repression of religious groups,"" citing treatment of Buddhists in Tibet and minority Uighur Muslims in the Xinjiang region that has drawn condemnation from human rights groups.

Yang defended China's policies in Xinjiang as measures against ""ethnic separatist activities and violent terrorist crimes"" but said it was a Chinese internal affair and foreign governments should not interfere.

1418,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2018 11:51PM ET</span>",U.S. halting refueling of Saudi-led coalition aircraft in Yemen's war,"By Phil Stewart
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is halting refueling of aircraft from the Saudi-led coalition engaged in Yemen, the United States and Saudi Arabia said on Friday, ending one of the most divisive aspects of U.S. assistance to the Saudi war effort. 
Saudi Arabia, in a statement released by its embassy in Washington, said it had decided to request an end to U.S. aerial refueling for its operations in Yemen because it could now handle it by itself.
U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis backed the decision and said the U.S. government was consulted.
The move comes at a time of international outrage over the murder of U.S.-based Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and after Democratic and Republican lawmakers threatened to take action in Congress next week over the refueling operations.
Critics of the Saudi campaign - including Democrats who won control of the House of Representatives in elections on Tuesday - have long questioned U.S. involvement in the war, which has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced more than 2 million and led to widespread famine in Yemen since it began in 2015.
""I've been calling for this for over three years,"" said Representative Ted Lieu, a Democrat from California.
""We shouldn't be supporting coalition war crimes and I look forward to continuing to scrutinize the U.S.'s role in Yemen when we’re in the majority next Congress.""
Even as President Donald Trump's administration has condemned Khashoggi's murder, the White House has sought to preserve its relationship with Saudi Arabia. 
A coordinated decision by Washington and Riyadh to halt the refueling could be an attempt by both countries to forestall further action by Congress.
Senators Todd Young, a Republican, and Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, had warned the Trump administration was running out of time to act.
""If the administration does not take immediate steps... we are prepared to take additional action when the Senate comes back into session,"" Young and Shaheen said.
CONTINUING U.S. SUPPORT
Beyond refueling, the United States provides limited intelligence support to the Saudi-led coalition and sells it weaponry used in Yemen's war. 
Mattis said the United States would play a continuing role to help the Saudi-led coalition and Yemeni forces minimize civilian casualties and expand humanitarian efforts. 
He also suggested plans to build up Yemeni troops.
""The U.S. and the Coalition are planning to collaborate on building up legitimate Yemeni forces to defend the Yemeni people, secure their country’s borders, and contribute to counter Al Qaeda and ISIS efforts in Yemen and the region,"" Mattis said in a statement.
Earlier this year, Mattis had defended U.S. military support to Saudi-led coalition forces in Yemen, when lawmakers weighed forcing the Pentagon to end Washington's involvement.
Mattis argued that halting U.S. military support could increase civilian casualties, since U.S. refueling had given pilots more time to select their targets. He told them cutting off support could jeopardize cooperation on counter-terrorism and reduce American influence with Saudi Arabia.
Mattis also argued it would embolden the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels, who have fired missiles at Saudi Arabia and targeted commercial and military vessels off Yemen’s coast.
Still, a halt to refueling could by itself have little practical effect on the war. U.S. officials told Reuters only a fifth of Saudi-led coalition aircraft require in-air refueling from the United States. 
In recent weeks, Mattis has appeared to voice a growing sense of urgency toward ending the conflict. At the end of October, Mattis joined U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in calling for a ceasefire. 
United Nations Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths is aiming to convene the country's warring parties for peace talks by the end of the year.
Saudi Arabia, in its statement, said its coalition was hopeful that U.N.-sponsored negotiations would lead to a negotiated settlement and ""an end to the aggression by the Iranian backed Houthi militias' against the Yemeni people and countries in the region.""

1419,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2018 11:23PM ET</span>",Senate Democrats weigh lawsuit over Trump Justice Department appointment,"By David Morgan and Jonathan Landay
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democrats are considering legal action over President Donald Trump's appointment of a new acting attorney general, congressional sources said on Friday, as some outside experts called the move unconstitutional.
Trump on Wednesday named Matthew Whitaker to replace former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was forced out after months of attacks by Trump for recusing himself from an ongoing probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.
The move made Whitaker supervisor of the investigation, which has hung over Trump's presidency. Whitaker has criticized the probe in the past as too wide-ranging, which has raised concerns among Democrats that Sessions' ouster and Whitaker's appointment might be precursors to Trump moving to end it.
Senate Democrats were considering suing Trump, the sources said, on the grounds that, in naming Whitaker, the president ignored a statutory line of succession at the Justice Department and deprived senators of their constitutional ""advice and consent"" role on some presidential appointments.
""The only two paths to that office are regular succession, and advice (and) consent,"" said a source close to the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal told Reuters late on Friday he was ""considering action that might be brought against an interim appointment that violates the normal statutory line of succession and raises very serious constitutional questions.""
He said he was speaking only for himself and he hoped Republicans might join as plaintiffs if a lawsuit goes forward.
The Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution states that some senior government officials, known as ""principal officers,"" must be confirmed by the Senate.
A spokesman for Senate Judiciary chairman Chuck Grassley said Trump had the authority to appoint Whitaker as acting attorney general temporarily, even though he had not been confirmed by the Senate. 
Such appointments can be done for senior officials who have worked in the department for at least 90 days and can last for up to 210 days, spokesman George Hartmann said.
As the minority party in the Senate, Democrats might need some Republican support to have legal standing to sue Trump under the Appointments Clause, said Andrew Wright, who was a White House lawyer under former President Barack Obama.
The source close to the Senate Judiciary Committee said Democrats were unsure whether they would reach out to Republicans to join the lawsuit, but added it was ""not likely.""
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who earlier this year introduced legislation to protect Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is conducting the probe, said Whitaker did not pose a threat to his work. 
""Mueller will be allowed to do his job,"" Graham said in a Friday interview on Fox News Radio.
John Yoo, a former Justice Department lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, said ""the Supreme Court made clear that the Attorney General is a principal officer"" in a 1998 case.
""Therefore, Whitaker cannot serve as acting Attorney General ... Any other officer in the Justice Department who was appointed through advice and consent can serve, including the Deputy AG, the solicitor general, and the assistant AGs,"" said Yoo, now a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley.
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a career Justice Department official already confirmed by the Senate, should have been named the new attorney general.
RESTRICTIONS ON TRUMP
U.S. intelligence agencies have said Russia interfered in the 2016 election in an attempt to tip it towards Trump and away from his Democratic opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
Republican Senator Susan Collins said Mueller must be allowed to complete his investigation into whether Trump's campaign colluded with Moscow.
Trump has repeatedly said there was no collusion, and has slammed the probe as a ""witch hunt."" Russia has denied interfering.
""I am concerned about comments that Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker has made regarding the Special Counsel and the parameters of his investigation,"" Collins said in a statement.
""We should bring to the Senate floor legislation that would put restrictions on the ability of President Donald Trump to fire the Special Counsel.""
Speaking to reporters at the White House before he left on a trip to Paris, Trump defended his choice of Whitaker, saying the former U.S. attorney for the southern district of Iowa had an excellent reputation and came highly recommended by former Iowa Governor Terry Branstad, who is now Trump's ambassador to China.
In a late night Tweet on Friday, Trump reiterated that he did not know Whitaker, but that he was very highly thought of by Iowa senators Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley and Branstad.
""I feel certain he will make an outstanding Acting Attorney General!,"" Trump said. 
Trump said on Friday he had not discussed the Mueller probe with Whitaker before appointing him.

A spokeswoman for the Justice Department has said Whitaker would oversee all matters under its jurisdiction, including the Mueller investigation. Democrats have called on Whitaker to recuse himself.

PARIS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron headed toward a potential clash in talks on Saturday after Trump took offense to what he called a ""very insulting"" comment from Macron about the need to create a European army.
Fresh off U.S. congressional elections that saw his Republican Party's power erode, Trump is spending the weekend in Paris to bolster the U.S.-European alliance at World War One remembrance ceremonies.
But in a tweet prior to landing in Paris, Trump took a dim view of comments Macron made in a Europe 1 radio interview this week.
Discussing cyber security threats and global instability in general, Macron said Europe needs to protect itself against China, Russia and the United States. 
Later in the interview he spoke about the need for a European army.
“Confronted by Russia, which is on our borders and which has shown itself willing to be threatening, we need to have a Europe that can better defend itself by itself and in a sovereign way, without depending solely on the United States,"" he said.
Trump, who has pushed NATO allies to pay more for their common defense and not rely so heavily on the United States, complained.
""Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly,"" Trump said on Twitter.
The president, joined by his wife Melania and high-ranking U.S. officials, arrived late on Friday aboard Air Force One for a visit that he called ""very special"" and one that he ""looked forward to.""
Trump's official mission on the trip is to participate in ceremonies marking the 100th anniversary of the end of World War One. He will make pilgrimages to two American cemeteries, Belleau Wood two hours east of Paris on Saturday and Suresnes on the western outskirts of the capital on Sunday, where he will make formal remarks.
His trip comes just days after congressional elections delivered results that will complicate his next two years. While Republicans slightly expanded their majority in the U.S. Senate, they lost control of the U.S. House of Representatives to Democrats who may use their newfound power to launch investigations into Trump and stymie his agenda.
Trump's talks with Macron at Elysee Palace are likely to cover European concerns about Trump's plans to withdraw the United States from the 1980s Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Agreement and U.S. renewal of sanctions against Iran.
Macron told Europe 1 radio that the ""main victim"" of the U.S. withdrawal from the INF accord was Europe and its security. 
The French president, who tried but failed earlier this year to talk Trump out of withdrawing from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, has also voiced worries about the impact of sanctions on European companies doing business with Iran.
Trump may also chat briefly with Russian President Vladimir Putin when both are among dozens of world leaders gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to mark the end of the Great War 100 years ago. Trump and Putin are expected to have formal talks later this month when both attend a G-20 summit in Buenos Aires.
Trump, who has pursued ""America First"" policies since taking over the presidency in January 2017, declared himself a ""nationalist"" during the run-up to the congressional elections, a term likely to raise concerns in Europe.

""I’m not a globalist, but I want to take care of the globe, but first I have to take care of our country,"" he told Fox News Channel's ""The Ingraham Angle"" last week. ""I want to help people around the world, but we have to take care of our country, or we won’t have a country.""

1422,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2018 08:15PM ET</span>",Qatar pays Gaza salaries to ease tensions; Israel says money's not for Hamas,"By Nidal al-Mughrabi
GAZA (Reuters) - A $15 million Qatari cash infusion was paid out to impoverished Palestinian civil servants in the Gaza Strip on Friday, offering Hamas a potential domestic reprieve though Israel said the money would not go to the dominant Islamist group.
Hamas's political rival based in the West Bank, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, has slashed Gaza budgets, beggaring tens of thousands of government employees. That has helped stoke a half-year of bloody protests and occasional shelling exchanges across the border of Gaza, which Israel keeps under blockade.
Palestinian sources said the Qatari payout, received on Thursday, was the first of a total of $90 million that would come into Gaza over the next six months with Israeli approval.
Israel had previously agreed to the gas-rich Gulf Arab state donating materials for civilian construction projects or fuel, worried that more fungible cash donations could reach Hamas, against which it has fought three wars in a decade.
""One day, I have no money to get food or medicine for my children - and now I will buy them food, medicine and clothes,"" said Wael Abu Assi, a traffic policeman, outside a Gaza City post office where people queued to draw their salaries.
Branded a terrorist group in the West, Hamas has been under years of embargo by Israel and neighboring Egypt. Hamas leaders said in the past they had received funds from other countries including Iran.
Observers for Qatar were present at all 12 post offices across Gaza to monitor the salary disbursements. Employees had to present their identity card and be finger-printed.
Doha's donations, as well as U.N.-Egyptian truce mediation and winter rains, have tamped down the violence at the border, where Gaza medics say Israeli army fire has killed more than 220 Palestinians since the protests began on March 30 to demand rights to lands lost to Israel in the 1948 war of its creation.
Israel, which says its lethal force prevents armed infiltrations, has had a soldier killed by a Gaza sniper and tracts of forest and farmland burned in brushfires set by incendiary material flown over on kites or helium balloons. 
ENVOY'S CONVOY STONED
On Friday, the Israeli army shot dead a Palestinian and wounded 37 other on the border, Gaza medics said. The military said troops faced some 10,000 Palestinians protesters, some of whom threw grenades. 
Earlier, Qatar's point-man for Gaza relief efforts, Mohammed Al-Emadi, visited a site near the border fence. ""Long live Qatar!"" shouted some of the Palestinian youths there. ""Long live Gaza!"" he replied. 
But as the diplomat's convoy departed, some youths threw stones that smashed a window on his bodyguards' car - suggesting not all Palestinians were pleased with Qatar's intervention. Al-Emadi's car was unscathed. 
Qatar's official news agency said the donated money would benefit 27,000 civil servants out of over 40,000 public servants hired by Hamas since 2007. The rest would be paid through local revenues it said.
""They told me they don't have money for me,"" one employee told Reuters on condition that he would not be named. ""Maybe Israel vetoed my name?"" 
Officials from Hamas, Qatar and Israel have been largely silent about the details of the Gaza payouts arrangement. 
But a member of right-wing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet played down their significance. 
""This is not money that is going to Hamas activities. It is money that is going to the salaries of civil servants, in an orderly, organized manner,"" Environment Minister Zeev Elkin told Tel Aviv radio station 102 FM. 
Elkin accused Abbas, whose peace talks with Netanyahu stalled in 2014 and who is boycotting the United States because of its pro-Israel policies, of cutting salaries to ""inflame Gaza, because he has not been successful on other fronts"".
""The Qataris came along and said: 'We are willing to pay this instead of Abu Mazen (Abbas), in order to calm Gaza down'. What does it matter who pays it?"" Elkin said.

Wasel Abu Youssef, a member of the executive committee of the Abbas-led Palestine Liberation Organization, criticized the move. ""Arrangements through Qatar and elsewhere prolong the crisis of Palestinian division,"" Abu Youssef told Reuters.

The unnamed pro-Brexit ministers have briefed May on their alternative plan, the newspaper reported, without citing sources.
The ministers have proposed that Britain continue to pay EU membership fees up to 2021 and follow the bloc's rules to avoid a cliff edge exit when it leaves in March 2019, the Sun said.
The country would then be able to negotiate with Brussels as a 'third country' for two years, making it easier to agree on a new free trade deal and avoid having to pay the full 38 billion pounds ($49 billion) divorce bill.
As negotiations with Brussels enter their final fraught stage, May's approach is under fire from all sides of the divisive Brexit debate.
Many politicians are unhappy with her compromise plans to maintain the free trade of goods with the EU, which they say will leave Britain subject to decisions in Brussels without any input.
If a deal is voted down by parliament, the country could be thrust into an uncertain future: leaving abruptly without a deal, the collapse of May's government, an election, or, as some opponents of Brexit hope, a new referendum.

When May was presented with the alternate proposal, she told the ministers that their plan ""was not needed yet"" but it was greeted with a ""surprisingly warm response"" from Finance Minister Philip Hammond, the Sun said.

Arriving in Paris for a World War One Armistice Day centenary celebration, Trump fired off a note on Twitter saying Macron had just ""suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia."" 
""Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly,"" Trump added, returning to his repeated demand that European nations do more to help fund the Western alliance.
Macron said on French radio on Tuesday that Europe needed a real army to reduce reliance on the United States for defense in the face of a resurgent Russia.
""We won’t protect Europeans if we don’t decide to have a real European army,"" Macron said.
""Faced with Russia, which is near our borders and has shown it could be threatening - I want to build a real security dialogue with Russia, which is a country I respect, a European country - but we must have a Europe that can defend itself on its own without relying only on the United States,"" he added.
The European Commission executive later echoed Macron's call for a European military capability. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is a long-time supporter of the idea the European Union should have more common defense capability.
The Commission's chief spokesman, Margaritis Schinas, said the EU was working to collaborate on defense procurement and research as well as developing EU military peacekeeping capabilities. 
""I don't think that this defense identity will start with an EU army,"" Schinas said on Tuesday.
""At some point in time, probably down at the end of this process, we may see something that people already describe as an EU army or an EU pooling of resources to make this EU defense identity more visible and more meaningful,"" Schinas said.

RIO DE JANEIRO/SÃO PAULO (Reuters) - Police arrested a controlling shareholder of meatpacker JBS SA and two former Brazilian agriculture ministers on Friday in connection with an investigation into illegal campaign contributions.
Joesley Batista, a member of the family that founded the world's largest meat processor, is expected to be held only temporarily, his lawyer André Callegari said. He declined to elaborate on the arrest order or the investigation. 
Antonio Andrade and Neri Geller, who served consecutively as agriculture ministers under former President Dilma Rousseff, were also arrested, according to a list of arrest warrants seen by Reuters and confirmed by a federal court official.
Geller, who was recently elected to Congress, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Andrade, the current deputy governor of Minas Gerais state, could not be reached for comment and his press office did not immediately respond to a request.
Earlier in the day, the federal police and tax authorities said they were investigating allegations that a large meatpacking firm, which they did not identify, had provided illegal campaign funding to lawmakers and officials at the agriculture ministry.
Police were serving multiple arrest and search warrants related to the investigation in five states and Brasília, according to the federal police and the federal revenue service, which are jointly conducting the probe.
Batista's arrest is the latest blow to JBS's controlling family, which last year signed plea bargain agreements with prosecutors admitting to bribing scores of politicians to advance their business interests.
Shares in the company fell 5 percent in early trading and by late afternoon were 2.33 percent down at 10.05 reais apiece.
""Joesley Batista has been strictly abiding with the terms of his agreement to cooperate with authorities,"" Callegari said. Batista has testified multiple times and provided evidence to authorities, he said.
Ricardo Saud, a lawyer for J&F Investimentos, which controls JBS, was also arrested by police for questioning.
Batista and Saud were arrested in September on charges of concealing information related to their plea agreements with federal prosecutors. They were both released in March.
J&F said in a statement that it found Friday's arrests very strange because the executives had cooperated with prosecutors to the point where their information made it possible to open the investigation.
Saud's detention was ""perplexing"" because he was always open to help authorities even with documents and audio recordings used as evidence, the statement added. 
Two large retailers based in the state of Minas Gerais were also involved in the case, which authorities say relates to events in 2014 and 2015. They did not name the retailers.

The tax authority said 22 million reais ($5.85 million) in bribes may have been paid to politicians and officials.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena dissolved parliament on Friday night and called a general election for Jan. 5 in a move that will likely deepen the country's political crisis.
The dissolution, which is expected to be challenged in court, was revealed in an official gazette notification signed by Sirisena which also set the next sitting of parliament for Jan. 17. 
The move comes after an intense power struggle in the past two weeks which followed Sirisena's sudden sacking of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the appointment of former leader Mahinda Rajapaksa, a pro-China strongman, in his place.
Following the sacking, the president suspended parliament in a move which Wickremesinghe said was intended to prevent the ousted prime minister from contesting the decision in the legislature. 
Later Sirisena agreed to reconvene parliament on Nov. 14, but that will now not happen.
Wickremesinghe has refused to vacate the official prime minister's residence saying he is the prime minister and had a parliamentary majority.
Before he signed the papers dissolving parliament and calling the election, Sirisena appointed allies of his and of Rajapaksa to cabinet positions. 
""This is a gross violation of the constitution,"" Harsha De Silva, a lawmaker in Wickremesinghe's party, told Reuters in reference to the dissolution of parliament. 
Independent legal experts had told Reuters that parliament could be dissolved only in early 2020, which would be four-and-half-years from the first sitting of the current parliament. The only other legal ways would be through a referendum, or with the consent of two thirds of lawmakers. 
Given those views, it was not immediately clear how Sirisena can legally dissolve parliament, though his legal experts have said there are provisions for him to do so. 
Sri Lanka's Election Commission was quoted in some local media as saying that it will seek a Supreme Court opinion before conducting the election. 
Sirisena also put the police and government's printing office under his defense portfolio, local media reported.
Ajith Perera, a lawmaker of the Wickremesinghe-led United National Party (UNP) said the party will challenge the decision at the Election Commission first and then may head to the Supreme Court.
Perera said the dissolution was carried out so that Sirisena could avoid defeat in parliament next week.
Keheliya Rambukwella, a spokesman for Sirisena's government, said the president's coalition had the backing of 105 lawmakers as of Friday, eight short of a parliamentary majority.
Sirisena has said he fired Wickremesinghe because the prime minister was trying to implement ""a new, extreme liberal political concept by giving more priority for foreign policies and neglecting the local people's sentiment.""

India and Western countries have requested that Sirisena act in line with the constitution while they have raised concerns over Rajapaksa's close ties with China. Beijing loaned Sri Lanka billions of dollars for infrastructure projects when Rajapaksa was president between 2005-2015, putting the country deep into debt.

LONDON (Reuters) - Jo Johnson, the younger brother of Boris, resigned from British Prime Minister Theresa May's government on Friday, calling in a withering critique for another referendum to avoid her Brexit plans unleashing Britain's greatest crisis since World War Two.
Quitting as a junior transport minister, Johnson called May's Brexit plans delusional and said he could not vote for the deal she is expected to unveil in parliament within weeks.
""Britain stands on the brink of the greatest crisis since the Second World War,"" said Johnson, a former Financial Times journalist who voted to stay in the EU in the 2016 referendum.
Johnson, 46, called it the worst failure of statecraft since the 1956 Suez canal crisis, in which Britain was humiliatingly forced by the United States to withdraw its troops from Egypt.
""To present the nation with a choice between two deeply unattractive outcomes, vassalage and chaos, is a failure of British statecraft on a scale unseen since the Suez crisis,"" he said. 
""Given that the reality of Brexit has turned out to be so far from what was once promised, the democratic thing to do is to give the public the final say,"" he added.
Johnson's criticism underscored the travails that May faces in getting any Brexit divorce deal, which London and Brussels say is 95 percent done, approved by her own fractious party.
The pound sank to a day's low beneath $1.30 on the resignation and also fell against the euro. It was unclear whether others would follow Johnson out of government. 
In the June 2016 referendum, 17.4 million voters, or 51.9 percent, backed leaving the EU while 16.1 million, or 48.1 percent, backed staying. 
Johnson wants a three-way referendum giving the people a choice between remaining in the EU, May's deal and no deal.
May's office rejected his call, saying Britain would not hold a second referendum on its EU membership ""under any circumstances"".
""UNITED IN DISMAY""
Johnson is the 14th minister to have resigned from government since November last year and the most senior to have called for another referendum in his leaving statement.
His resignation was published after May spent much of the day in France and Belgium, laying wreaths alongside fellow leaders to mark the centenary of the end of World War One. 
As negotiations with Brussels enter their final fraught stage, May’s approach is under fire from all sides of the divisive Brexit debate. 
Many politicians are unhappy with her compromise plans to maintain the free trade of goods with the EU, which they say will leave Britain subject to decisions in Brussels without any input.
In his 1,600-word resignation statement, Johnson said May's proposed deal would leave Britain in a ""far worse"" negotiating position than now, adding he also knew from his work at the Department of Transport how painful a ""no deal"" Brexit would be.
Boris Johnson, a leading supporter of Brexit who quit as foreign secretary in July, praised his brother's decision, saying they were ""united in dismay"" - despite their opposing views on Brexit - over May's handling of the negotiations.
May is expected to hold a cabinet meeting later this month in the hope of securing ministers' support for her negotiating stance and hopes to strike an exit deal with the EU in the next few weeks.
Compounding May's problems on Friday, the Northern Irish party that props up her minority government cast her Brexit negotiation as a betrayal and said it could not support any deal that divided the United Kingdom.
The Democratic Unionist Party interpreted a promise made by May in a letter that she would never let a division of the UK ""come into force"" as an admission that such a clause would be included in a final deal.
As campaigners step up pressure on the government calling for the public to be given another say on Brexit, the opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn dashed campaigners' hopes he could back another referendum. 

Asked by German magazine Der Spiegel if he would stop Brexit if he could, Corbyn said: ""We can't stop it. The referendum took place....What we can do is recognize the reasons why people voted leave.""

SANTIAGO/BERLIN (Reuters) - German lawmakers have proposed that former members of a Chilean cult established by an ex-Nazi in the 1960s be offered compensation by the German government, according to the parliamentary group of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives.
The budget committee of the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, said it had included a proposal in its budget plan to pay out a total 1 million euros ($1.13 million) to victims. 
The cult and the community that housed it, called Colonia Dignidad, was a secretive sect founded in 1961 by former World War II German army medic Paul Schaefer in the foothills of the Chilean Andes.
Schaefer preached ultra-traditional values while sexually abusing and torturing dozens of youths. During the 1973 to 1990 dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, the community also served as a detention and torture site for enemies of the state.
Schaefer died in 2010, while serving a 20-year sentence for sex abuse.
In 2006, former members of the cult issued a public apology and asked for forgiveness for 40 years of human rights abuses in their community, saying they were brainwashed by Schaefer, who many viewed as a god.
""Across political groups and in the near future we want to achieve results with the 'Joint Commission to Assist Victims of Colonia Dignidad',"" the parliamentary group's spokesman for human rights, Michael Brand, said in a statement.
The federal draft budget, which includes the proposal to compensate victims, still needs to be approved. 
The budget committee was not immediately available for comment.

Colonia Dignidad continues to stir controversy in Chile. The community has been rebranded as a rustic, Bavaria-themed retreat, which victims argue is disrespectful.

THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday the gunman who killed 12 people in a crowded South California bar this week was a ""very, very sick guy"" and speculated the former U.S. Marine combat veteran could have been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.
""He is a very sick puppy,"" Trump said of the gunman, speaking at the White House before leaving on a trip to Paris.
Victims of Wednesday night's rampage in the city of Thousand Oaks included an 18-year-old freshman student at Pepperdine University, a security guard at the Borderline, a graduate of California Lutheran University and a Marine Corps veteran.
Ian David Long, 28, walked into the Borderline Bar and Grill, which was packed with dancing college students, and opened fire, fatally shooting 12 people before apparently killing himself, law enforcement officials said.
The FBI was seeking a motive for the country's latest mass shooting. 
Even as Thousand Oaks, a suburb 40 miles (64 km) northwest of downtown Los Angeles, mourned the dead the city faced a fresh threat on Friday as wildfires raged in the area, forcing thousands of people from their homes.
Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean told reporters on Thursday that Long may have suffered from PTSD.
""He was a Marine, he was in the war, he served time, he saw some pretty bad things,"" Trump said. ""And a lot of people say he had PTSD and it's a tough deal.""
Richard Berge, who lived near Long and looked after his mother's dogs, told Reuters she had told him earlier this year she worried her son might take his own life but did not fear he would hurt her.
The Thousand Oaks massacre took place less than two weeks after a man shot dead 11 worshippers at a Pittsburgh synagogue, fueling the debate over gun ownership in America. 
One of the dead, Telemachus Orfanos, had survived the mass shooting at a country music concert in October 2017 in Las Vegas that killed 58 people, the worst such incident in modern U.S. history, ABC News said, citing a friend.
It was time for politicians to act, Orfanos' mother, Susan Schmidt-Orfanos, told ABC News.
""I don't want prayers. I don't want thoughts,"" she said. ""I want gun control and I hope to God nobody else sends me any more prayers.""
'STILL REELING'
The wildfire that started on Thursday had destroyed some homes on the outskirts of Thousand Oaks and forced the mandatory evacuations of 75,000 people, as well as closing some highways. A large plume of smoke grew on the horizon to the northeast of the city. 
At a press conference Linda Parks, a Ventura County supervisor, whose district includes Thousand Oaks, noted the area was dealing with both the shooting and the fires.
""We are still reeling, but we are also very resilient,"" she said.
The fire near Thousand Oaks was one of three fast-moving wildfires burning in California on Friday morning. Fierce winds were expected to keep fanning the flames during the day.
Although mass shootings have become part of the fabric of modern American life, it was a shock for this city, a sprawling suburb of 127,000 people that was named the third safest city in the United States for 2018 by the Niche research company.
Heather Wynalda, 47, a resident of Conejo Valley, which is a few miles to the west of Thousand Oaks, said her brother's home had been consumed by fire, but he and his family were safe.
""It's just devastating,"" she said via Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) messenger. ""This community pulled together so beautifully in the midst of yesterday's shooting... and today, it is being frantically scattered in an effort to escape the fires.""
Evacuation centers have been set up in Thousand Oaks, including a teen center where during Thursday frantic parents waited for news of their children after shooting.
California Lutheran University, which just the day before canceled classes, announced that although the school had not been ordered to evacuate because of the fire, it would close Friday and was ""monitoring the situation closely.""

Pepperdine University, which had held a prayer service in Malibu following the shooting, announced Friday that it was closing its Malibu and Calabasas campuses due to wildfires.

One described the update on the state of play be members of European Commission negotiator Michel Barnier's team as ""sober"" and free of ""drama"". ""More talks to be had,"" summed up another.
Barnier's deputy Sabine Weyand held further talks with Oliver Robbins, the lead negotiator for British Prime Minister Theresa May during the day, EU officials said, and more discussions were planned for Sunday, keeping up an intense pace.
Both sides have closed in on a deal but remain deadlocked over clauses aimed at avoiding disruption on the Irish border -- an issue that is dividing May's government and jeopardizing her ability to get any agreement through the British parliament.
""The ball continues to be in the UK's court,"" said a third EU diplomat, stressing that the Union had already given London many options and that it needed now to make up its mind.

Britain is due to leave the European Union in March, with or without a deal to smooth the process which will separate the world's fifth biggest economy from its biggest trading partners.

A foreign ministry spokesman declined to say whether the decision was partly motivated by the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.
""We have decided that in the present situation we will not give new licenses for the export of defense material or multipurpose goods for military use to Saudi Arabia,"" Foreign Minister Ine Eriksen Soereide said in a statement.
Germany said last month that it would halt German arms exports to Saudi Arabia until the killing of Khashoggi was explained. 
Norway's announcement comes a week after its foreign minister summoned the Saudi ambassador to Oslo to protest Khashoggi's assassination.
The decision (to suspend licenses) was taken after ""a broad assessment of recent developments in Saudi Arabia and the unclear situation in Yemen,"" the foreign ministry said in its statement.
Saudi Arabia is leading a coalition of forces against Iran-aligned Houthi fighters in Yemen, in a conflict that has driven much of Yemen's population to the brink of famine.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal appeals court that is weighing a legal challenge to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's authority said Friday it wanted to know whether the sudden ouster of Attorney General Jeff Sessions could impact or change the outcome of how it should rule.
The court's order directed each party in the case to file briefs by Nov. 19 outlining, ""what, if any effect, the November 7, 2018 designation of an Acting Attorney General different from the official who appointed Special Counsel Mueller has on this case.""
The order came one day after a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit heard oral arguments on whether Mueller was unlawfully appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in May 2017 and wielded too much power.
The challenge to Mueller's authority was being brought by Andrew Miller, an associate of President Donald Trump's long-time political adviser, Roger Stone.
Several of Stone's associates have been subpoenaed by a grand jury in recent months, as part of Mueller's probe into whether Trump's campaign colluded with Russia. 
Trump has called the investigation a witch hunt, and both he and Russia deny colluding.
Miller defied the subpoena in May, was later held in civil contempt, and filed a lawsuit alleging that Mueller's appointment violated the U.S. Constitution and also that Rosenstein had no authority to hire him.
Mueller was named special counsel by Rosenstein after Sessions recused himself from the probe. However, Rosenstein lost his role as Mueller’s supervisor on Wednesday after Trump forced Sessions to resign and replaced him with Matt Whitaker.
As acting attorney general, Whitaker has assumed oversight of the Mueller investigation. 

Democrats have called on Whitaker to recuse himself as he has previously made negative comments about the probe.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Suicide attackers set off two car bombs at a hotel in Mogadishu on Friday, killing at least 22 people, police said.
The militant Islamist group al Shabaab, linked to al Qaeda, claimed responsibility for the attack on the Hotel Sahafi, which is near the headquarters of Somalia's Criminal Investigations Department (CID). 
Hotel guards and CID officers opened fire after the blasts, police added. Then, about 20 minutes later, a third explosion from a bomb placed in a three-wheeled ""tuk-tuk"" vehicle near the hotel hit the busy street, witnesses said.
""Four militants who attempted to enter the hotel were shot dead by our police and the hotel guards,"" police captain Mohamed Ahmed told Reuters.
""Two other militants were suicide car bombers who were blown up by their car bombs. The third car was remotely detonated. So in total 28 people died, including the six militants.""
Abdifatah Abdirashid, who took over the Sahafi from his father after he was killed in a militant attack in 2015, was among those who died in Friday's attack, said Mohamed Abdiqani, a witness at the hotel.
""The militants who entered the hotel compound faced heavy gunfire from the hotel guards. Abdifatah Abdirashid, the hotel owner, and three of his bodyguards died,"" Abdiqani said.
A Reuters photographer at the scene saw 20 bodies of civilians and burnt-out minibuses, motorbikes and cars. 
Abdiasisi Abu Musab, al Shabaab's spokesman for military operations, said the group had singled out the Sahafi for attack because of its association with the government the Islamists want to overthrow.
""We targeted it because it acts as government base. Government officials and security forces are always in the hotel,"" he told Reuters. 

Somalia has been engulfed by violence and lawlessness since dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was toppled in the early 1990s.

1437,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2018 11:01AM ET</span>",Thousands flee three swift-moving California blazes,"By Stephen Lam
PARADISE, Calif. (Reuters) - Three fast-moving wildfires burned in California on Friday morning, including one that spurred the evacuation of 75,000 homes near a city that was still reeling from a mass shooting.
Voluntary evacuations of 75,000 homes were called for because of the Woolsey Fire that affected parts of Thousand Oaks in Ventura County northwest of Los Angeles, the site of a shooting massacre this week. 
A former U.S. Marine combat veteran opened fire in a bar packed with college students in the town on Wednesday night, killing 12 people and stunning a leafy community with a reputation for safety.
An evacuation site was at capacity at the Thousand Oaks Teen Center, which had also served as a family assistance and reunification site following the shooting. 
Several evacuation sites were issuing protective masks for citizens, Ventura County Emergency Services said.
The Woolsey blaze was also burning in parts of Los Angeles County, where mandatory evacuation orders were given Friday morning south of U.S. Highway 101, the Los Angeles County Fire Department said. 
The fire had jumped Highway 101 in several places, including Calabasas and Agoura Hills, and was moving southwards toward coastal Malibu, Malibu Search and Rescue said in a post on Twitter. Parts of that major freeway were closed in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, fire officials said.
The fire ignited Thursday afternoon south of the city of Simi Valley, Ventura County officials said.
Also burning in Ventura County was the Hill Fire, which had torched 10,000 acres (4047 hectares) by Thursday night, fire officials said.
In Northern California, the Camp Fire advanced rapidly to the outskirts of the city of Chico early on Friday, forcing thousands to flee after it left the nearby town of Paradise in ruins, California fire officials said.
Evacuation notices were set for homes on the east side of Chico, a city of about 93,000 people about 90 miles (145 km) north of Sacramento.
The Chico Fire Department said: ""Firefighters continue to actively engage the fire in order to protect life and property.""
Flames from the unchecked, 20,000-acre (8,100-hectare) Camp Fire were being driven westward by 35-mile-per hour (56 km-per-hour) winds, fire officials said. 
The blaze earlier ripped through Paradise, about 20 miles east of Chico. 
""The town is devastated, everything is destroyed. There's nothing much left standing,"" said California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) spokesman Scott Maclean.
""This fire moved so fast and grew so fast a lot of people got caught by it.""
Maclean said an as-yet unspecified number of civilians and firefighters were injured, and that it could be days before authorities would know of any fatalities.
Paradise, located on a ridge, has limited escape routes. Traffic accidents turned roads into gridlock and residents abandoned vehicles and ran from the flames, carrying children and pets, officials said. One woman stuck in traffic went into labor, the Enterprise-Record newspaper reported.
""It’s very chaotic,” said Officer Ryan Lambert of the California Highway Patrol. 
Rescuers used a bulldozer to push abandoned cars out the way to reach Feather River Hospital and evacuate patients as flames engulfed the building, Butte County Supervisor Doug Teeter told reporters.
The hospital was totally destroyed, Mike Mangas, a spokesman for operator Dignity Health, told Action News Now.
The fire, which began early on Thursday, was the fiercest of several wind-driven blazes across California, during what has been one of the worst years for wildfires in the state.
In Ventura County, ""Strong Santa Ana winds (are) expected to continue through this morning,"" the National Weather Service in Los Angeles said on Twitter on Friday. That helped double the size of the Woolsey Fire to 8,000 acres (3238 hectares), fire officials said.
Wind gusts of 50 to 70 mph (80 to 113 kph) were expected in the mountains of Ventura County and up to 50 mph in its valleys and coastal areas, the NWS said.

Travel was limited on U.S. Highway 101 in the county, state highway patrol troopers said.

1439,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2018 09:36AM ET</span>","Special Report: Double agents - How soccer clubs, players and advisers play the tax game","By Tom Bergin and Cassell Bryan-Low
LONDON (Reuters) - Behind most millionaire soccer stars stands a successful soccer agent. Except when it comes to filling out a tax return.
Take Manchester City and the French player Gael Clichy, recruited by the club in 2011 for more than 4 million pounds ($5.2 million) a year. Man City recorded that soccer agent Darren Dein represented it in the negotiations.
Yet British press reports identified Dein as Clichy's agent starting in 2010. And in two emails to officials at a European club in 2013, Dein said he acted for Clichy.
Who Dein represented became the subject of inquiry by UK tax inspectors. It is not the only instance to attract the attention of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC).
An examination of thousands of documents relating to some of the world's richest soccer clubs shows how clubs and players have repeatedly clashed with the tax authority over the role and pay of agents. At stake are hundreds of millions of pounds in tax revenue.
The ""Football Leaks"" documents, which include emails and contracts, were obtained by the German publication Der Spiegel and reviewed by Reuters in partnership with European Investigative Collaborations, a consortium of international media.
Agents typically take a cut of at least five percent of a player's wage for negotiating on the player's behalf. In many cases, the club pays, treating this sum as part of the player's overall remuneration package. Under UK law, this is a taxable ""benefit in kind"" to the player. The player becomes liable for income tax and sales tax, and the club becomes liable for social security payments. If the player has negotiated a salary net of tax, the club ends up paying all of it.
But if the parties can show that the agent worked for the club, not the player, none of these taxes are due and the agent's fee is treated as a regular business expense. In such cases, clubs benefit, and the tax authorities are the losers. 
In the instance of Man City and Dein, tax inspectors challenged the club's account of Dein's role in negotiating that 2011 contract with Clichy, the documents show.
In 2013, the tax authority wrote to Man City about a 1.2 million pound payment it made to Dein in 2011 and asked why the club hadn't reported a ""benefit"" to Clichy. It noted that ""all the information in the public domain shows that Dein is the player's agent."" In November 2015, after a meeting with the club, the tax authority wrote, ""As stated during our meeting, we do not accept that Darren Dein doesn't act for the player.""
Later the same month, Man City's head of finance, Andrew Widdowson, acknowledged in a letter to the tax authority that while Man City had paid Dein ""to influence the player into joining us"" in 2011, the club also accepted that ""as you point out, Darren Dein is the player's agent and with that in mind we accept that a proportion of the fee should be apportioned as Dein acting for the player.""
Man City sought to reach a deal with HMRC over the unpaid tax, exchanges between the club and the tax authority show. Reuters was unable to determine the outcome. Based on the sum involved and the tax rate at the time, the total bill was likely to have been at least one million pounds, if Dein was deemed to have represented Clichy alone, Reuters has calculated.
Man City said it would not comment on ""out of context materials purported to have been hacked or stolen from City Football Group and Manchester City personnel and associated people. The attempt to damage the Club's reputation is organized and clear.""
A law firm representing Dein and Clichy declined to answer questions about their relationship.
The tax authority said it would not comment on individual cases, but added, ""HMRC works closely with football clubs to ensure payments made to their agents during the renegotiation of a contract or club transfer are taxed correctly. We actively challenge any payments we consider not to be realistic and ask for evidence to prove legitimacy of any arrangement.""
In recent years, the UK tax authority has increased its scrutiny of clubs, including those in the world's richest soccer league, the English Premier League. As of November 2018, the tax authority was investigating 171 players, 44 clubs and 31 agents about agents' fees and other tax issues and had recouped 332 million pounds, it said, without naming the agents, clubs or players concerned.
But in the documents examined by Reuters, the tax authority didn't impose any punishment. Instead it offered to settle back-tax claims without a penalty. And, the documents show, it allowed clubs to say agents jointly represented a club and a player. The tax authority declined to answer questions about this arrangement and why it hadn't imposed penalties.
Between May 2015 and January 2018, agents were involved in around 1,400 contract negotiations between Premier League clubs and players, according to player transfer data gathered by English soccer's governing body the Football Association. In over 80 percent of these negotiations, the Football Association recorded that the club and the player used the same agent, a Reuters analysis of the publicly available data found.
But public statements by some agents suggest that in many instances the agent was only working for the player.
Some club officials have expressed concern that they are pushing the boundaries of what is permissible. Following inquiries by the UK tax authority about how Man City reported player benefits, club finance head Widdowson in July 2015 emailed the chief financial officer of Man City's parent company and noted agents' fees were sometimes an area ""where we are sailing close to the wind.""
Man City declined to answer questions about how it reported its relationship with football agents. Widdowson did not respond to requests for comment.
THE FATHER AGENT
Soccer players rely on agents to help them negotiate contracts, choose clubs and maximize their earnings off the field, from activities such as advertising. For many years it was routine for clubs to pay agent fees on behalf of players without reporting these payments as a ""benefit in kind,"" and for the UK tax authority to let the practice go unchallenged.
By the early 2000s, with the value of player contracts soaring, the tax authority began to look more closely at this arrangement. One of the people that caught its attention was Vincent Kompany, captain of Man City and then captain of Belgium's national team.
In November 2014, Belgian agent Jacques Lichtenstein told Dutch magazine Sports Football that Kompany had been a client for years. In June that year, an executive at Lichtenstein's firm, Eleven Management, wrote to a potential business partner listing several of Eleven's clients. Vincent Kompany was the first name on the list drawn up by the executive, Peter Verplancke.
Yet in July 2012, when Kompany agreed a new 6 million-pounds-a-year contract with Man City, the club recorded in a submission to the Football Association that Kompany was advised not by Lichtenstein, but by someone with no apparent experience of the high rolling English Premier League - his father, Pierre. Pierre Kompany's name does not appear on Belgian or English lists of registered agents. His website says he has worked as a taxi driver, engineering lecturer and municipal politician.
For its part, Manchester City signed a contract with Lichtenstein and his firm Eleven Management. The tax authority wrote to Man City asking it to clarify Lichtenstein's role in the negotiations. Man City finance head Widdowson replied in November 2012 that the club had retained Lichtenstein to ""help negotiate with his (Kompany's) father.""
Kompany did not have an agent, Widdowson said in the letter. ""As far as we are aware there is no signed agreement between Jacques Lichtenstein and Vincent Kompany."" As late as October 2015, Widdowson was maintaining in an email to the tax authority that ""Vincent Kompany's father actually represents him in all of his negotiations.""
If the tax authority accepted Man City's account that Lichtenstein worked for the club, and not the player, payments to the agent wouldn't be considered a taxable ""benefit in kind"" to Kompany. The authority wouldn't levy sales tax or social security. If it considered that Lichtenstein solely represented Kompany, however, the total tax bill would have been at least 2.3 million pounds, according to Reuters calculations based on the agreed fee and prevailing tax rates.
The authority's review of the matter found that ""Lichtenstein to all intents and purposes acts and behaves like he is the player's agent,"" a tax official wrote to Man City in November 2015.
Documents appear to show Man City considered settling with tax authorities. Reuters was unable to determine whether Man City ultimately accepted that Lichtenstein represented Kompany or paid back taxes.
The tax authority, Man City and Pierre Kompany declined to comment. Lichtenstein and Verplancke did not respond to requests for comment. Vincent Kompany's lawyer said ""my Client's case has been investigated by the Authorities thoroughly in the recent past and he has answered all their questions satisfactorily, which was confirmed in writing."" He said Reuters calculations ""can only be based on incorrect facts and/or guesses"" but declined to identify inaccuracies or answer detailed questions.
In 2014, the tax authority challenged Man City about another deal involving a Belgian player, Dedryck Boyata.
Boyata had signed a contract with the club in 2010 and negotiated a new deal in 2011. Man City recorded for tax purposes that in both deals, Boyata relied on the advice of his father, Bienvenu, a former soccer player who ran a van rental business. Bienvenu Boyata does not appear on Belgian or English lists of registered agents.
Man City again retained Lichtenstein as its agent, contracts and other files show. The club told the tax authority it felt the need to retain an agent because Boyata, advised by his father, had demands the club found unrealistic.
""DB's father was asking for too much money and JL was used to try to get DB's father to see sense & reduce his demands,"" according to club minutes of a February 2015 meeting between Man City and tax officials.
Man City had hired Lichtenstein after club official Brian Marwood met him at a Boyata family event, where the agent was present ""as a family friend,"" the club told tax officials at that same meeting.
Yet Man City documents referred to Lichtenstein as Boyata's agent. These include a 2012 spreadsheet that listed Man City players and their representatives and other communications. In an interview with Belgium newspaper DH in August this year, Boyata said Lichtenstein had represented him ""for a long time.""
Reuters could not determine the outcome of the tax authority's inquiry or whether Man City agreed to pay any back tax for the Boyata deals.
The tax authority and Man City declined to comment. Marwood, Lichtenstein and Dedryck Boyata did not respond to requests for comment. Bienvenu Boyata replied in a text message that ""for good growing of the player you need both the father and best agent's service.""
A NEAT STEPOVER
From around 2010 clubs, managers and soccer players were increasingly adopting a different approach to recording agent fees. They recorded in their tax filings that an agent worked for both a club and a player or manager. They didn't split the agent's fee evenly. Instead, they attributed only a small share of the fee to the player or manager. That gave some ground to the tax authorities, but limited the tax liability assumed by the player or manager.
For example, in 2013, Jose Mourinho, one of the biggest names in world soccer, returned to Chelsea Football Club as manager. Public statements and documents reviewed by Reuters show Mourinho has used an agent named Jorge Mendes since at least 2004. When Chelsea sent a draft contract to Mendes' firm, Gestifute, in June 2013, it proposed paying Mendes's fee and recording that 90 percent of the total was in recompense for his work for Chelsea.
UK tax rules state that the breakdown of fees must reflect the true nature of the business relationship. If the club pays almost all the fee on its own account, rather than on behalf of the manager or player, then the agent must have acted overwhelmingly to represent the club's interests.
Emails between Chelsea and Gestifute show Mendes acted diligently in Mourinho's interest, not the club's. For example, when Gestifute lawyer Carlos Osorio de Castro returned a draft contract to Chelsea, he omitted a clause inserted by the club that 10 percent of Mendes's fee would be reported as a benefit to Mourinho. The clause, de Castro noted, would have made Mourinho liable for tax.
Chelsea Finance and Operations Director Chris Alexander responded that, despite the additional cost to Mourinho, the clause had to be in the contract. Because Mendes ""is Jose's agent,"" Alexander wrote in an email to de Castro, ""it is not credible for tax purposes that some part of the fee is not allocated to services for Jose. 10 percent is the absolute minimum we feel we can put in.""
Gestifute accepted that the clause be kept in the contract. Chelsea declined to answer any questions about the matter. ""We do not comment on speculation concerning confidential contracts or related matters,"" a club spokesman said.
De Castro declined to answer questions citing confidentiality obligations to clients. The tax authority also declined to comment. Alexander, Gestifute and Mourinho did not respond to requests for comment.
NO PENALTIES
In hundreds of emails and letters between the UK tax authority and clubs and between club officials, Reuters did not come across a single proposed or threatened penalty in respect of an inaccurate filing.
Even in cases where the tax authority says it believes a club has inaccurately reported the role of an agent, it has only sought back tax in relation to half the agent's fee, the documents show.
In October 2015, the tax authority wrote to Man City to say it believed the club had inaccurately reported who agents worked for in respect of seven players. In the case of one, it said the club ""must have been aware"" of the inconsistency at the time it submitted tax filings. Nonetheless, the tax authority did not threaten penalties and simply proposed that the club recalculate its past tax bills.
The tax authority and Man City declined to comment.
In the most recent deals reviewed by Reuters, the clubs and tax authorities appear to have found common ground. The tax authority has settled on an approach that accepts an agent can equally represent both sides of a negotiation, emails from the tax authority to the clubs and between clubs and their tax advisers show.
Consequently, the even splitting of agents' fees between the two sides has become common in the top echelons of British soccer, dozens of player contracts and other emails seen by Reuters show.
Yet the documents raise questions about whether the equal sharing of fees accurately reflects the relationships between the parties.
For example, when manager Jose Mourinho went on to join Manchester United in 2016, he, the club and agent Jorge Mendes signed a contract which apportioned the agent's fee evenly between the club and the manager.
In an email to Gestifute's lawyer de Castro, however, Man United's Director of Legal & Business Affairs Patrick Stewart referred to Mourinho as ""your client"" seven times.
And in one way at least, Gestifute appeared to be working contrary to Manchester United's interests. At the same time as Gestifute was negotiating the terms of Mourinho's Man United contract, the agency was in negotiations with another club to hire Mourinho. In May 2016, de Castro exchanged dozens of emails with officials of French team Paris St. Germain. A deal was never reached, but the talks progressed to the point of exchanging a Heads of Terms, or provisional contract.
Reuters couldn't determine if the tax authority challenged the way the agent's fee was split or how much tax was paid.
The tax authority declined to comment. Manchester United and Stewart declined to answer questions about the negotiations with Mourinho, but the club said it ""operates within the rules set by football's governing bodies and all payments and agreements are reported to HMRC in the standard way."" Gestifute, Mourinho and PSG did not respond to requests for comment. De Castro declined comment.

The tax authority's willingness to accept split fees in the face of contrary evidence means the soccer industry gets a generous break, and the UK Treasury and millions of ordinary taxpayers lose out.

SOMME VALLEY, France (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May laid a wreath at a cemetery in Belgium and traveled to northern France on Friday to honor 700,000 British soldiers killed in World War One, on the eve of commemorations to mark the centenary of the Armistice.
Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel accompanied May to the St Symphorien cemetery near Mons, where she laid tributes at the graves of the first and last British soldiers killed in the war. May said the commemorations were a time to ""reflect on our shared history, but also look ahead to our shared future"". 
More than 500 German and British Commonwealth soldiers are buried at the St Symphorien cemetery.
Among them is Private John Parr, a reconnaissance soldier who was killed on Aug. 21, 2014, when his commanding officer sent him into enemy territory on his bicycle to gather intelligence on German military moves. He was 17 years old.
Parr's headstone stands opposite that of George Ellison, the last British soldier to lose his life in the war. He died 90 minutes before the Armistice came into effect on Nov 11, 1918.
""That their graves lie opposite each other is a fitting and poignant symbol that brings home the eternal bond between them, and every member of the armed forces who gave their lives to protect what we hold so dear,"" May said. 
""We remember the heroes who lost their lives in the horror of the trenches. As the sun sets on 100 years of remembrance, we will never forget their sacrifice.""
Michel tweeted: ""The duty of memory is a must.""
May also held a working lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron in Albert, a town in the heart of the Somme region, as she steps up efforts to court European support for a Brexit agreement.
The two leaders will then attend a ceremony at the Thiepval Memorial. A wreath combining poppies and le bleuet, the two national emblems of remembrance, has been made for the occasion. 

Thiepval's memorial stands on high ground overlooking the Somme river, where some of the heaviest fighting of World War One took place. It commemorates more than 72,000 British and South African soldiers who died and have no known grave.

A Saudi-led coalition has been battling to push Iran-allied Houthis out of the city they have held since 2014. A surge of fighting in the past week has trapped thousands of civilians in the crossfire and coalition air raids.
The United States and Britain last week stepped up calls for an end to the nearly four-year war in Yemen that has driven it to the verge of famine, raising pressure on Saudi Arabia as it faces a global outcry over the murder of a prominent Saudi journalist in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. 
""As testament to how dire the situation is, some 445,000 people from al-Hodeidah Governorate have been forced to flee since June, according to UN data,"" spokeswoman Shabia Mantoo told a news briefing.
Some of them have fled to other parts of Hodeidah province and some to other areas of Yemen, she told Reuters.
The province of Hodeidah, including the port city, had a population of 2.6 million in 2011, four years before the civil war erupted, according to Yemeni statistics.
""While the number of those remaining in Hodeidah city is difficult to gauge, UNHCR is worried that people needing to flee for safety aren't able to do so. They are trapped by military operations, which are increasingly confining populations and cutting off exit routes,"" Manjoo said.
U.N. bodies have warned that an all-out attack on the Red Sea city, an entry point for 80 percent of Yemen’s food imports and aid relief, could trigger famine in the impoverished state. 
The UNHCR appealed to all sides to allow access to its warehouse stocked with emergency shelter and essential aid items that it said had been cut off by an active front line.
The U.N.'s World Food Programme (WFP) said on Thursday it planned to double its food assistance program for Yemen, aiming to reach up to 14 million people ""to avert mass starvation"".
Saudi Arabia is leading a Western-backed alliance of Sunni Muslim Arab states to try to restore Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and his internationally recognized government that was ousted from the capital Sanaa by the Houthis in 2015.

The United Nations has no up-to-date estimate of the death toll in Yemen. It said in August 2016 that according to medical centers at least 10,000 people had been killed.

1445,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2018 08:04AM ET</span>","Exclusive: 'Can't eat, can't sleep' - Rohingya on Myanmar repatriation list","By Ruma Paul
COX'S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - For Nurul Amin, a Rohingya Muslim living in a refugee camp in Bangladesh, the days since learning he and his family were among a group of people set to potentially be repatriated to Myanmar have been among the most frightening since they fled their home.
""I can hardly sleep at night for fear of getting forcibly repatriated. Since the time I heard that my name is on the list I can't even eat,"" says Amin, 35, who has four daughters, a wife and sister with him in the Jamtoli Camp in southeast Bangladesh.
Reuters identified and spoke to more than 20 of the roughly 2,000 Rohingya refugees on a list of people Myanmar has agreed to take back. Though officials say no-one will be forced to return against their will, all say they have been terrified since learning this month their names were on the list prepared by Bangladeshi officials and vetted by Myanmar. 
The list has not been made public and not all those whose names are on it have been informed, say Bangladeshi camp officials, due to concerns of sparking widespread panic in a camp that shelters 52,000 refugees.
Bangladesh and Myanmar agreed in late October to this month begin the repatriation of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims who fled across the border to escape a Myanmar army crackdown, even though the United Nations' refugee agency and aid groups say doubts persist about their safety and conditions in Myanmar should they return.
More than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims crossed from Rakhine state, in mostly Buddhist Myanmar, into Bangladesh from August last year after Rohingya insurgent attacks on security forces triggered a sweeping military response.
Refugees said soldiers and local Buddhists carried out mass killings and rape during the violence in 2017, while U.N.-mandated investigators have accused the military of unleashing a campaign with ""genocidal intent"".
Myanmar has denied almost all the allegations. It has rejected the U.N. findings as one-sided, and said the military action was a legitimate counterinsurgency operation.
WILLING TO RETURN?
This week, the U.N.'s human rights investigator on Myanmar urged Bangladesh to drop the repatriation plan, warning that Rohingya still faced a high risk of persecution in Myanmar.
A Bangladesh foreign ministry official, who asked not to be named, said on Friday the country would not send any Rohingya back forcefully. 
""The Bangladesh government is in talks with them to motivate them,"" he said.
Separately, another foreign ministry official told Reuters the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) would verify whether those shortlisted were willing to return. 
Firas Al-Khateeb, a UNHCR representative in Cox's Bazar, told Reuters that effort would start within a few days.
""We have not started the process yet but we will be carrying out an assessment of the voluntariness,"" he said.
Dr Min Thein, director of the disaster management department at the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement in Myanmar, said his team was preparing for 2,000 people to return.
""The Immigration Department is doing the scrutinizing,"" said Min Thein. An official at Myanmar's Immigration Department declined to answer questions over the phone. 
In late October, a delegation from Myanmar visited the camps in an effort to urge Rohingya to participate in the repatriation process.
""THROW US INTO THE SEA""
Refugees who spoke to Reuters said they did not trust the Myanmar authorities to guarantee their safety. Some said refugees would go back only if they got to return to their own land and were given citizenship. 
""I'll just consume poison if I am forced to go back. I saw my cousin shot dead by military ... What is the guarantee that we'll not be persecuted again?"" said Abdur Rahim, 47, who previously owned a shop and 2 acres of land in Rakhine.
Nur Kaida, 25, who is the mother of a 19-month-old girl, said it ""would be better to die in the camps rather go back and get killed or raped"".
On Friday, an alliance of humanitarian and civil society groups working in Rakhine and in refugee camps in Bangladesh, in a joint statement, warned sending people back would be ""dangerous and premature"".
The group called on the governments of the two countries to ensure that refugees in Bangladesh were able to make a free and informed choice about their return. It also said U.N. agencies should have unimpeded access to all parts of Rakhine in order to monitor the situation in areas of potential return. 
Recent days have seen dozens of Rohingya in Myanmar and Bangladesh attempting to flee via sea to Malaysia, raising fears of a fresh wave of dangerous voyages.
But despite poor conditions in the camps prompting some to risk such a perilous route out, those like Muhammed Wares, 75, whose name is on the list, say it is better than going back.

""Why are they sending us back?"" said Wares. ""They may as well throw us into the sea.""

1446,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2018 07:50AM ET</span>",German conservatives lean toward Merkel protege to run CDU: poll,"By Andrea Shalal
BERLIN (Reuters) - German conservatives narrowly favor Angela Merkel's protege to succeed her as Christian Democrat (CDU) leader, a poll showed, as rivals for the position promised to back the chancellor through her fourth term if they win. 
Some 35 percent of supporters of the conservative bloc that also includes the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) said they backed Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer to take over the CDU helm, Friday's survey for broadcaster ZDF showed.
Businessman Friedrich Merz scored 33 percent and Health Minister Jens Spahn 7 percent.
CDU delegates will elect a new leader at a party congress in December, but views among the larger conservative bloc are likely to shape how they vote. Whoever wins is expected to become the CDU's candidate for chancellor at the next national election in 2021.
While stepping down as CDU leader, Merkel has said she plans to serve her fourth term in full, though there has been speculation that she might leave early if Merz or Spahn won the party leadership.
Merz, who stands to the right of Merkel on the CDU spectrum, called the chancellor to assure her of his support and cooperation if he won, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
The businessman, who dropped out of politics after clashing with Merkel, repeated that message during a meeting with CDU lawmakers in Berlin on Thursday, the magazine said.
Merz is chairman of the German arm of BlackRock, whose Munich offices prosecutors searched on Tuesday as part of Germany's largest post-war fraud investigation. It covers the period 2007-2011, before Merz joined the hedge fund. 
Spahn offered similar assurances in an interview with the Funke newspaper chain published Friday. ""As party leader, I would work with her in as trusting a manner as before,"" he said.
Asked if Merkel should remain chancellor for the next three years, Spahn said, ""Why not?""
Kramp-Karrenbauer told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper that Merkel had not signaled any intention to step down as chancellor.
The poll for ZDF, in which Mannheim-based Forschungsgruppe Wahlen questioned 1,200 people, said some 63 percent were happy with Merkel remaining as chancellor until 2021, while 34 percent were not.

1448,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2018 07:20AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Mystery company named by murdered Maltese journalist is linked to power station developer,"By Stephen Grey and Tom Arnold
VALLETTA/DUBAI, (Reuters) - In February 2017, the Maltese investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia wrote in her blog about a mystery company in Dubai called 17 Black Limited. She alleged it was connected to Maltese politicians, but offered no evidence.
She was unable to discover who owned the company, and it remained unclear whether 17 Black had any significance.
Eight months later Caruana Galizia was killed by a car bomb, prompting an international outcry. No evidence has emerged that connects her death to any of her journalism. But her killing did renew interest in her many different claims, leading to media reports about such subjects as banking regulation and Malta's sale of passports. Now Reuters and other media have begun to unravel another mystery, that of 17 Black.
Two people familiar with the subject in Malta said a report by Malta's anti-money laundering watchdog had identified Yorgen Fenech, the chief executive of a Maltese property developer, as the owner of 17 Black. A third person familiar with the subject in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) said account records at a bank in Dubai identified Fenech as the owner of 17 Black. Reuters last month reviewed UAE banking correspondence that described Fenech as the owner and signatory of a 17 Black account at Noor Bank in Dubai.
Fenech is a director and co-owner of a business group that won a large energy concession from the Maltese state. In 2013, that group was granted the right by the Maltese government to build a 450 million euro ($517 million) gas power station on the island.
When asked to comment, Fenech declined to say whether he owns 17 Black.
The ownership of the company is significant because of another document, an email written in December 2015 by accountants for two senior figures in Malta's government. That email was discovered by Maltese financial regulators among documents obtained from the accountants' firm, according to a person briefed on the investigation. Its existence has been reported before and its authenticity has not been challenged.
The two senior political figures concerned are Konrad Mizzi, who was Malta's energy minister from 2013 to 2016, and Keith Schembri, the prime minister's chief of staff. Mizzi conceived and promoted the idea of offering the power station concession.
According to the December 2015 email, Panama companies owned by Mizzi and Schembri stood to receive payments from 17 Black for services that were unspecified. The email said the Panama companies expected 17 Black to be a ""main target client,"" with payments of up to $2 million expected within a year. The email made no reference to the gas power station energy scheme and there is no evidence the payments went ahead.
It remains unclear why the Panama companies owned by two senior political figures expected to receive money from 17 Black.
The December 2015 email was first published in April by the Daphne Project, a collaboration of news organizations, including Reuters, that has been carrying on the work of the murdered journalist. In a response at the time, Schembri said that firms he owned had a business plan to earn money from 17 Black but that those plans did not go ahead. He did not elaborate. Mizzi denied all knowledge of 17 Black.
Schembri and Mizzi both told Reuters in October they had no knowledge of any connection between 17 Black and Fenech, or of any plan to receive payments connected to Fenech or the energy project. Fenech denied making any plans to pay any politician or any person or entity connected to them.
The Maltese firm of accountants that sent the December 2015 email, NexiaBT, said it could not comment because of client confidentiality.
There is no suggestion that anyone connected with 17 Black was involved in Caruana Galizia's death. Three people have been charged with planting the bomb that killed her; they deny the charges. No evidence has emerged publicly about who ordered the assassination.
Mizzi, who is now Malta's tourism minister, issued a statement through a spokesman saying he ""reiterates that there is no connection, direct or otherwise, between him, the company or trust he held, and any entity called 17 Black. Furthermore, he has no information relating to 17 Black.""
In a statement to Reuters, Schembri said he had not heard that Fenech owned 17 Black. He said he was not involved in the power station project and, asked if he had intended to profit from the project, said: ""The answer is a categorical 'No'.""
Fenech said he and his companies ""never had (or intended to have) any untoward business relation"" with any politicians or politically affiliated individuals or entities. ""We have always and consistently run our operations in compliant, transparent and above-board fashion,"" he said.
Financial records identifying the owner of 17 Black were first discovered earlier this year by Malta's anti-money laundering watchdog, the Financial Intelligence and Analysis Unit (FIAU), according to two sources briefed on its findings.
Reuters reviewed UAE banking correspondence that summarized 17 Black's banking activity in Dubai. The documents stated that when 17 Black opened an account in June 2015 at Noor Bank in Dubai, the company declared it was 100 percent owned by a Maltese citizen called Yorgen Fenech. The correspondence also said Fenech is the account's sole signatory.
The only ""Yorgen Fenech"" listed on Malta's electoral roll and company register is the power station developer.
In the spring of this year, the FIAU passed Fenech's name to Malta Police's Economic Crime Unit as part of a wider examination of energy deals conducted by the government.
Malta Police said it was prevented by law from confirming whether it had received any information from the FIAU and whether any investigation was under way. In a statement, the FIAU declined to comment on 17 Black because of ""secrecy obligations"" under Maltese law.
A UAE government official, who was unwilling to be named, said UAE financial and law enforcement authorities were examining 17 Black's activities after a request for assistance from Maltese authorities. The official declined to elaborate.
In July 2017, more than a year after Caruana Galizia had mentioned the Panama companies owned by Mizzi and Schembri in her blog, a Malta magistrate ordered a judicial inquiry into whether the companies involved any illicit activity. Opposition politicians in Malta and members of the European Parliament called for Mizzi and Schembri to be suspended from office while that inquiry was conducted. The island's prime minister, Joseph Muscat, declined to do so.
In May this year, another magistrate ordered that 17 Black's activities should also be examined as part of the same probe. The inquiry is currently stalled, pending a legal challenge made on procedural grounds by Mizzi, Schembri and others. Both Mizzi and Schembri have said they would welcome testifying and disproving any allegations made against them before any inquiry.
In a statement to Reuters this month, referring to the judicial probes, Kurt Farrugia, the prime minister's spokesman, said that as the activities of 17 Black were under investigation, Muscat would ""await the conclusion of this process and act accordingly. He has been consistent on this point."" The prime minister, Farrugia said, did not know who owned 17 Black.
OLD FRIENDS IN POWER
Before he became a government minister, Mizzi worked as a management consultant. In September 2012, he became energy spokesman for Muscat's Labour Party. In January 2013, at the start of a general election campaign, Mizzi proposed an ambitious plan to reform Malta's energy sector.
Mizzi said the proposals, which counted on private investment to build a gas power station, would cut the country's bill for energy generation by 187 million euros a year. Muscat said he would implement the plan.
Labour won the March 2013 election. Muscat became prime minister and appointed Mizzi energy minister.
Mizzi and the government proceeded with the energy plan, and several deals were struck by October that year. One deal granted a concession to a private business group, selected from several bidders, to build and run the new gas power station. Under the selection procedure, Mizzi played no direct role in choosing the winner.
The winning group - which included Maltese investors, Azerbaijan's state oil company SOCAR, and the German company Siemens – was set up in 2013 and called Electrogas Malta. Fenech, the Maltese property developer, was a director and an investor. The 450-million-euro Delimara power station was completed in 2017.
Siemens declined to comment on whether Fenech owned 17 Black, or about Mizzi and Schembri's potential business connection, saying ""Siemens is not in a business relationship with the company."" SOCAR Trading, the subsidiary of SOCAR involved in the power station project, said it ""has no knowledge of the company 17 Black.""
In July 2015, Mizzi bought a shell company in Panama called Hearnville Inc, registering his ownership via an anonymous trust in New Zealand, according to corporate records and public statements later made by Mizzi. At the same time, Schembri acquired a Panama company, called Tillgate, also via a New Zealand trust.
Schembri, a businessman, had known Muscat, Malta's prime minister, since they were at school together in the 1990s. Schembri became Muscat's chief of staff in 2013. When he did so, he resigned his directorships of his Maltese printing and stationery business, but remained the owner. Schembri said his position in the prime minister's office gave him ""no involvement"" in the power station project.
When Hearnville and Tillgate, the two Panama companies, sought to open bank accounts, they were asked to list their likely sources of revenue. Accountants acting for Mizzi and Schembri sent an email on Dec. 17, 2015, to a Panamanian law firm that was assisting the search for a suitable bank. The email named 17 Black Limited and another company, Macbridge Limited, as the ""main target clients"" from whom banks could expect payments to Hearnville and Tillgate.
Mizzi and Schembri were asked this month by Reuters if they had knowledge of the email before it was sent. Schembri replied ""No"", without elaborating either about the email or what he knew of 17 Black. Mizzi replied that he ""did not see the alleged email you are referring to prior to its publication.""
Asked about Hearnville and Tillgate, Fenech told Reuters that ""neither I, nor any company/entity of which I am or have been involved in, have ever had (or had the intention to have) any relation whatsoever with the entities you mention."" Asked to clarify whether he owned or had any relation to 17 Black, Fenech did not respond.
Brian Tonna, head of NexiaBT, the accountancy firm that sent the email, said he was prevented by client confidentiality from commenting. He added that the firm was cooperating fully with the authorities.
The December 2015 email said both 17 Black and Macbridge were registered in Dubai. Reuters found no trace of Macbridge. The banking correspondence reviewed by Reuters indicated 17 Black was registered in the nearby emirate of Ajman and opened an account at Noor Bank in Dubai in June 2015.
The person familiar with 17 Black's arrangements in the UAE said 17 Black was a ""flexi-desk company,"" a business that could be created without a physical presence in the country. Around 9 million to 10 million euros went through 17 Black's account at Noor in 2015, the person said, after which the account became dormant. Reuters could not confirm those figures.
The source said that most of the money paid into the 17 Black account had swiftly moved on to other entities, though it had retained a balance of about 2 million euros. Based on the absence of evidence for the business purpose of these in-out transactions, Noor Bank froze the account in September, the source said.
In a statement, Noor Bank declined to confirm any details of the bank account or its actions, saying it was ""legally precluded from any unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer information"" but always complied with any formal requests for information from authorities.
Maltese financial investigators have traced two payments to 17 Black, according to a source briefed on the investigation and a draft FIAU report from 2017 seen by Reuters. One was $200,000 sent to 17 Black on July 10, 2015, from Orion Engineering Group Limited, marked as provision of ""manpower"" in Qatar. Orion is a Maltese company owned by Maltese businessman Mario Pullicino, according to the report and public corporate records. Pullicino was also a company secretary of Armada Floating Gas Services Malta Limited. Armada was set up in June 2015. It provided a gas storage tanker for the new power station commissioned by Mizzi.
Pullicino confirmed to Reuters making the $200,000 payment and said it was for work unrelated to the Malta gas project. Speaking by telephone, he declined to provide further details of the transaction, 17 Black or its owners. He said his company ""has never paid any money to any politically exposed people.""
Pullicino did not respond to further questions about whether he knew 17 Black was owned by Fenech.
Another payment to 17 Black consisted of $1.5 million sent in November 2015 by Mayor Trans Limited, a Seychelles company with a bank account in Latvia, marked as for ""financial advisory services.""
Mayor Trans, according to public U.S. regulatory filings relating to that start-up, is ultimately owned by an Azeri citizen named Rufat Baratzada. The address given for Baratzada in U.S. regulatory filings is a modest apartment in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. Neighbors there described 51-year-old Baratzada as a former subway worker.
His family, contacted at Baratzada's new one-storey home at end of an unpaved road on the outskirts of Baku, said he was now working as a security guard on a construction site in Baku. Reached by telephone and asked whether he owned Mayor Trans, Baratzada said: ""If it's me, it's me."" He declined to talk further.
POLITICALLY EXPOSED
Through the autumn of 2015, the Panama companies acquired by Mizzi and Schembri applied to open bank accounts in Panama, Miami, Dubai, St. Lucia and the Bahamas, according to evidence assembled by Malta's financial investigators from emails, obtained directly from the offices of Maltese accountants for Mizzi and Schembri, and detailed in the draft FIAU report. Copies of the emails were also contained in the Panama Papers and shared with Reuters by the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, which first obtained the Panama Papers.
According to those emails, opening bank accounts proved tough. The biggest obstacle, the emails indicated, was that the ultimate owners were politicians.
Financial institutions are obliged to take special care in handling customers designated as ""politically exposed persons,"" or PEPs - people entrusted with a prominent public function or their families. Banks shy away from handling the money of PEPs if they are unsure about the source of it.
The emails show that efforts to open accounts for the Panama companies of Mizzi and Schembri continued until February 2016. That month Caruana Galizia and other Maltese media reported the existence of the Panama companies. Mizzi and Schembri then commissioned audits of the New Zealand trusts they had set up to hold the shares of their Panamanian companies. Both audits were conducted in October 2016 by an office of Crowe Horwarth accountants in Wellington, New Zealand.
The firm declined to comment on questions from Reuters. In notes attached to the audits published by Mizzi and Schembri, the accountants said that the audits were based on ""sufficient and appropriate evidence."" The audits stated the Panama companies had carried out no trading activities and that neither had a bank account.

In March last year, 17 Black changed its name to Wings Development, according to the person familiar with 17 Black's arrangements in UAE. An official at Ajman Free Zone said Wings Development was still registered there but provided no evidence. Reuters could locate no company of that name for comment.

SYDNEY/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - A Somali-born man set fire to a pickup truck laden with gas cylinders in the center of the Australian city of Melbourne on Friday and stabbed three people, killing one, before he was shot by police in a rampage they called an act of terrorism.
Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, without providing any evidence.
The utility truck carrying barbecue gas cylinders burned on busy Bourke Street just before the evening rush hour as the driver stabbed bystanders and attacked police.
The cylinders did not explode and the fire was put out in 10 minutes, by which point the attack was over. 
""We are still trying to piece together whether the vehicle was lit then he got out the car or whether he got out the car and then the vehicle took flame,"" Victoria Police Commissioner Graham Ashton told reporters. 
Video posted to Twitter and broadcast on television showed the man swinging a knife at two police officers, while his truck burned in the background.
One of the officers shot the man and he collapsed to the ground clutching his chest, the video showed. Other footage showed two stab victims lying on the ground nearby.
The attacker died in hospital, as did one of the victims, Ashton said. ""From what we know of that individual, we are treating this as a terrorism incident,"" he said of the attacker.
Victoria police declined to comment when contacted about Islamic State's claim. The militant group also claimed responsibility for a deadly siege in the city in 2017 when a Somali man was killed by police after taking a woman hostage.
INVESTIGATION BEGUN
Police gave no information identifying the Melbourne attacker but Ashton said the man was known to them and intelligence authorities because of family associations.
All of the victims were men, Ashton said. He declined to release their names because police were still in the process of contacting families.
Asked if the man had recently traveled to Syria he said: ""That is something we might be able to talk more about tomorrow."" 
A staunch U.S. ally, Australia has been on alert for such violence after a Sydney cafe siege in 2014, and its intelligence agencies have stepped up scrutiny, though there was no warning of the latest attack.
Authorities say Australia's vigilance has helped to foil at least a dozen plots, including a plan to attack downtown Melbourne at Christmas in 2016.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a statement released on Twitter: ""Australia will never be intimidated by these appalling attacks.""
Ashton said there was no longer a threat to the public, but that security would be boosted at horse races and Remembrance Day memorials over the weekend.
TEN MINUTES OF CHAOS
Video posted to social media showed chaotic scenes as bystanders scattered while the attacker fought with police and his victims lay bleeding on the footpath.
One man charged at the tall attacker, wearing a long black shirt, with a shopping trolley just before police drew their weapons.
A witness, Markel Villasin, told Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio: ""Bystanders were yelling out 'just shoot him, just shoot him'."" They did.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said the attack was ""an evil, terrifying thing that's happened in our city"".
Warning text messages were sent after the attack and police sealed off the downtown area, usually busy with shoppers and diners on a Friday evening. Some cordons were lifted later, though the immediate crime scene would be sealed until Saturday, police said.
Memories remain fresh of a fatal but not terror-related attack on the same street last year, in which a man drove his car at pedestrians at high speed, killing six people and wounding about 30. That prompted the city to install hundreds of security bollards. The driver is currently on trial.

In December 2014, two hostages were killed during a 17-hour siege by a ""lone wolf"" gunman, inspired by Islamic State militants, in a cafe in Sydney.

YANGON (Reuters) - A Myanmar court dismissed on Friday a case against three senior journalists from the country’s largest private newspaper, after authorities in the city of Yangon agreed to drop the charges.
Eleven Media’s chief reporter, Phyo Wai Win, and two editors, Kyaw Zaw Lin and Nayi Min, were arrested on Oct. 10 for incitement after publishing an article that quoted lawmakers raising questions over spending by the Yangon city government.
They were freed on bail on last month after President Win Myint ordered authorities to try to settle the dispute through negotiation.
""The case was dismissed today at the court,” said defense lawyer Kyee Myint. “We welcome it.”
Yangon’s regional government is headed by Chief Minister Phyo Min Thein, a protégé of civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and a member of her National League for Democracy party.
He has demanded an apology and said on Thursday he would press ahead with a legal case against the media group if he did not get one through the negotiations, as recommended by the president.
""If the negotiation doesn't succeed, I will continue the legal process,"" he said.
The chief minister’s assistant declined to answer questions over the telephone.
In late 2016, Eleven Media's chief executive and another editor were detained for nearly two months over a complaint made by Phyo Min Thein over a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post alleging corruption.
Phyo Min Thein told a news conference at the time that the allegations were “intended to defame my personal dignity”. Eleven Media published an apology.
On Friday, Eleven Media editor-in-chief Kyaw Zaw Linn told Reuters the outlet had no intention of apologizing this time.
""There is nothing that went wrong and we have no reason to apologize,” he said.
Free speech advocates say press freedom in Myanmar has retreated under the administration of Nobel laureate Suu Kyi, who took power in 2016 under a constitution that preserves the military’s role in politics despite a formal end to decades of army rule.
A total of 44 journalists have faced charges under various laws during her administration, freedom of expression group Athan said last month.
Two Reuters reporters were convicted in September of breaching the Official Secrets Act and sentenced to seven years in prison, drawing global condemnation.

Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, were detained last December while investigating a massacre of 10 Rohingya Muslims that took place during a military crackdown in western Rakhine state.

For the first time, the meeting of regional officials on ways to end the war included a Taliban delegation, as moves toward achieving a political settlement pick up.
""We discussed the subject of direct talks with the Taliban and asked them to choose the place and the starting time,"" said Ehsan Tahiri, High Peace Council spokesman, according to Russia's RIA news agency.
The meeting, which underlines Russia's desire to be involved in any settlement in Afghanistan, took place as U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad prepared for a fresh round of talks with Taliban officials in Qatar.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said that ""we reaffirm our position on the lack of alternative to a political settlement in Afghanistan and the need for active coordinated efforts by Afghanistan's neighboring countries and regional partners"".
Western officials and Ghani's government view the Moscow meeting with some suspicion, seeing it as an attempt by Russia to push its way into a process that they say must be led by Afghanistan.
As well as the five-member Taliban delegation, Russia brought to the meeting several senior Afghan political figures, including some who have clashed with Ghani in the past. Ghani's government sent only a delegation from the High Peace Council, a group set up to coordinate reconciliation efforts.
The Taliban issued a statement this week saying the conference was ""not about negotiating with any particular side"".
It said the meeting was ""about holding comprehensive discussions on finding a peaceful solution to the Afghan quandary and ending the American occupation"".

Ghani offered in February to talk to the Taliban without pre-conditions but the insurgents, who regard his government as a foreign-controlled regime, have refused, saying they will deal only with the United States.

VIENNA (Reuters) - A senior Austrian military officer is believed to have spied for Moscow for decades, Vienna said on Friday, adding to a list of recent Russian espionage cases and souring relations with arguably the country's closest ally in the EU.
Austria was in the minority of EU countries that did not expel any Russian diplomats over the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Britain, which London has blamed on Moscow. Russia denies any involvement.
Conservative Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who governs in coalition with the far-right and pro-Moscow Freedom Party, has said that decision was in line with Austria's neutrality and a tradition of maintaining good relations with countries on both sides of the former Iron Curtain. 
Vienna is a major diplomatic center hosting many foreign officials.
But Kurz hardened his tone on Friday, announcing that a recently retired colonel was believed to have spied for Moscow from the 1990s until this year.
""If the suspicion is confirmed, such cases... do not improve relations between Russia and the European Union,"" he told reporters, without naming the suspect. The case has been referred to prosecutors and the former colonel has been questioned.
Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl, who danced with Russian President Vladimir Putin at her wedding in August, has canceled a planned trip to Moscow over the case. She has also summoned the Russian charge d'affaires since the ambassador is outside the country.
""For the moment we are demanding transparent information from the Russian side,"" Kurz said. 
'UNPLEASANTLY SURPRISED'
In Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he was ""unpleasantly surprised"" by Vienna's allegations and Moscow knew nothing about the retired officer, news agencies RIA and Interfax reported.
Russia had in turn summoned the Austrian ambassador, agencies said.
Kurz repeatedly referred to a recent case in the Netherlands in which the government said Russian agents tried to hack into the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons while it was investigating the Skripal case. 
Western countries last month issued coordinated denunciations of Russia for running what they described as a global hacking campaign.
""Based on the information we have but also because of recent events for example in the Netherlands we can very much assume at the moment that our suspicion will be confirmed,"" said Kurz, who has met Putin in Austria twice since the Skripal poisoning.
It is not yet clear whether the case is an isolated one, Defence Minister Mario Kunasek said, speaking alongside Kurz.
Austria was tipped off about the case weeks ago by an ally's intelligence service, and issues of interest to the officer or his alleged handlers included weapons systems and migration into Europe, Kunasek added.

ANTANANARIVO (Reuters) - The head of the European Union's observer mission to Madagascar's presidential election said on Friday that any irregularities found so far were minor and unlikely to affect the results.
Hery Rajaonarimampianina, seeking a second term and one of the three front-runners, complained on Thursday about the use of an invalid voter register, delays in opening of the polls in some places, intimidation and ballot-stuffing.
But the EU's chief observer Cristian Preda said they had not detected anything that would alter the result or call Wednesday's vote into question.
""We are in a good atmosphere. The disputes are part of the democratic game... it's normal, it's human. Disputes must be handled by the law enforcement bodies,"" Preda said.
He however noted that the lack of a cap on campaign spending by the candidates had put some at a disadvantage, without providing any names.
In an irony in one of Africa's poorest countries, the result of the first round of voting could hinge in part on which of the three front-runners -- all wealthy men -- spent the most money campaigning for the contest.
""In 2013, the European Union recommended capping candidate expenses and in future reports, there will still be this recommendation,"" Preda said. 
Voters are eager to get a winner who will tackle the impoverished Indian Ocean island's many problems including unemployment and corruption.
The poll pits Rajaonarimampianina against former president Andry Rajoelina, who has claimed victory already, and another former leader Marc Ravalomanana. The contest has drawn a total of 36 candidates.
Because of the unusual high number of contestants, few expect an outright winner and the poll is widely expected to go into a second round. This would involve only the two top candidates and would be held on Dec. 19.

Observers and Malagasy are hoping for the second peaceful election since the upheaval of 2009, when Ravalomanana was forced out of office by protests led by Rajoelina in what international organizations such as the African Union said was a coup.

1454,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2018 05:51AM ET</span>",Sri Lankan Tamil parties reject president's call to support controversial new PM,"By Shihar Aneez and Ranga Sirilal
COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka's main Tamil parties have turned down a call from President Maithripala Sirisena to support his newly appointed prime minister in a likely floor test in parliament this month, the parties said on Friday.
Sirisena triggered off a political crisis on the island by sacking Ranil Wickremesinghe as prime minister and appointing controversial opposition leader Mahinda Rajapaksa to the job last month.
Wickremesinghe has challenged his ouster as unconstitutional and sought a session of parliament to determine who holds a majority. Sirisena met the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) to persuade the main minority group to drop its opposition to Rajapaksa who led the country to a crushing defeat of Tamil separatist guerrillas when he was president, but who is accused of human rights violations.
""President asked the TNA to abstain from voting, but we said the abstention would lead to legitimising an unconstitutional move,"" M.A. Sumanthiran, a TNA spokesman, told Reuters.
Buddhists make up about 70 percent of Sri Lanka's 21 million people and ethnic Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, about 13 percent. Muslims and other communities make up the rest.
Western nations led by the European Union are concerned that Sri Lanka's halting steps toward a national reconciliation and justice for the victims of the war crimes will be endangered by the return of Rajapaksa.
Sirisena has faced criticism for sacking the premier in a sudden move last month and plunging the country into a political crisis. Since then he's been trying to bolster the new administration.
Mano Ganeshan, the leader of another minority Tamil party, said the president had suggested three options at the meeting.
""The first, he said we can join the government accepting ministerial positions. If not, he asked us to remain neutral in the parliament. The third option was not to support Wickremesinghe saying that he and Ranil Wickremesinghe can’t work,"" Ganeshan told Reuters.
Both Wickremesinghe and Rajapaksa have maintained they have the parliament majority. The house will sit on Nov. 14. Political parties have accused each other of trying to engineers defections.
The uncertainty has already dented investor sentiment on currency, bond, and stock markets. The rupee hit a record low last week, before appreciating due to central bank intervention, market sources have told Reuters. 
The bourse has seen an outflow of 7.2 billion rupees since the political crisis unfolded, while the bond market suffered an outflow of 11 billion rupees, mostly on the three market days after the crisis. 

The yields in Sri Lanka's sovereign bonds have risen between 109-260 basis points, raising the risk of making the island nation's borrowing cost expensive.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Northern Irish party which props up Prime Minister Theresa May's government on Friday cast her Brexit negotiation as a betrayal and cautioned it could not support a deal that divided the United Kingdom.
The warning underscores the travails that May faces in getting any Brexit divorce deal, which London and Brussels say is 95 percent done, approved by both her fractious party and by the Northern Irish lawmakers who keep her in power.
Less than five months before Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29, negotiators are still haggling over a backup plan for the land border between British-ruled Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland should they fail to clinch a deal.
The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) interpreted a promise made by May in a letter that she would never let a division of the UK ""to come into force"" as an admission that such a clause would be included in a final deal, the Times reported.
""The prime minister's letter raises alarm bells for those who value the integrity of our precious union and for those who want a proper Brexit for the whole of the United Kingdom,"" DUP leader Arlene Foster said.
""From her letter, it appears the prime minister is wedded to the idea of a border down the Irish Sea with Northern Ireland in the EU single market regulatory regime,"" Foster said.
The DUP has torpedoed Brexit talks before.
Nearly a year ago, its refusal to sign off on a deal on the border caused the temporary collapse of Brexit talks at a crucial stage. Negotiators later found a way to keep all sides on board.
The Brexit deal - or the lack of one - will shape Britain's prosperity for generations to come and have long-term consequences for the European Union's global clout.
Both sides need an agreement to keep trade flowing between the world's biggest trading bloc and the fifth largest global economy. The other 27 members of the EU combined have about five times the economic might of Britain.
Britain's junior Brexit minister told a German media outlet he was optimistic there would be a deal soon.
""ALARM BELLS""
Ever since May triggered formal divorce talks in March 2017, negotiators have struggled to find a solution to the 310-mile land border on the island of Ireland.
Both sides want to avoid customs posts that some fear could reignite the violence in Northern Ireland that was ended by a U.S.-brokered peace accord in 1998. 
Under discussion is a fallback option for the border. London argues that the whole of the United Kingdoms should stay inside a temporary customs arrangement with the EU, though it is unclear for how long and what would happen after exiting that. 
The EU has insisted on a insurance policy - or a backstop to the backstop - a demand London signs a treaty clause that could leave Northern Ireland inside the EU customs space.
That is unacceptable for May's ""Unionist"" supporters whose entire political ideology is based on defense of Northern Ireland's place within the United Kingdom. 
""We will not support arrangements that leave Northern Ireland separated from the rest of the United Kingdom and tied to the European Union's customs or regulatory regimes,"" Foster said in a letter to May which was published on Friday.
She added that any backstop could not leave Northern Ireland aligned to specific sectoral EU market regulations. And any backstop would have to have a clear expiry date. 
If May can clinch a deal with the EU, she still needs to get that deal approved by parliament. But it is unclear if she has the numbers: Around 320 votes in the House of Commons are needed to be certain of winning a vote.
Ever since her botched gamble on a snap election in 2017 lost her party its majority in parliament, May has relied on the DUP to govern.
May's Conservative Party has 315 lawmakers. It relies on the 10 DUP lawmakers to pass legislation.

""The PM knows the consequences, she now needs to reconsider,"" DUP lawmaker Sammy Wilson said.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is ""up and working"" and making jokes after being hospitalized with rib fractures, her nephew said on Thursday at the premiere of a new movie about her early career fighting for women's equality.
Daniel Stiepleman, who wrote the script for the film ""On the Basis of Sex"" about his aunt's work as a young lawyer, with input from the justice herself, told Reuters the 85-year-old Ginsburg was ""doing great.""
""The last I heard she was up and working, of course, because what else would she be doing, and cracking jokes,"" he said. ""I can't promise they were good jokes but they were jokes.""
Ginsburg was hospitalized in Washington after suffering three fractured ribs from a fall. Hours later, Hollywood got its first look at the new film about her pioneering work. 
""On the Basis of Sex"" stars Felicity Jones as a young Ginsburg and Armie Hammer as her tax attorney husband Martin, in a story about a landmark discrimination case the pair argued in 1972. Director Mimi Leder described the movie as the ""origin story"" of the justice, who became a hero among U.S. liberals.
""She is a woman who, like countless generations of women before her and since, withstood the subtle slights and overt discrimination of the culture around her,"" Leder told the audience at the movie's world premiere. ""She is a woman who changed that culture with her."" 
The film, which will debut in U.S. theaters in December on Christmas, depicts Ginsburg as one of just nine women at Harvard Law School in the 1950s, and later struggling to find a firm that will hire a Jewish woman as a lawyer. 
""I wanted to show someone who, when they're younger, didn't have all the answers,"" Jones told Reuters on the red carpet. ""She was making mistakes, finding out who she was, had a very young family, her husband wasn't very well.
""She was juggling a lot of difficult things at the same time,"" Jones added, ""but always (had) this absolute commitment to the law.""
The film chronicles a case involving Charles Moritz, a single man who was denied a $296 tax deduction because he was a male caregiver. Ginsburg and her husband successfully argued that the denial represented gender-based discrimination. 

The real-life Ginsburg made a brief, surprise appearance in the film, drawing applause from the crowd.

1459,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2018 04:13AM ET</span>",How Mattis is trying to keep U.S.-China tensions from boiling over,"By Phil Stewart and Idrees Ali
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When the United States imposed sanctions on China's military this fall, China retaliated by canceling Defense Secretary Jim Mattis' plans to meet his counterpart in Beijing. But just days later, a Chinese general visited the Pentagon with a reassuring message: Beijing valued the importance of military ties between the two countries. 
In the previously unreported visit, Huang Xueping arrived on Oct. 10 to see Mattis' aides, but the secretary briefly met him in the hallway with a message for Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe. The two were still going to be at a security conference in Singapore later in October, and Mattis told Huang he looked forward to meeting Wei there, said Randall Schriver, the Pentagon's top Asia policy official.
Relations between the world's two largest economies have plumbed new depths under President Donald Trump amid a bitter trade war and disagreements over Taiwan, the South China Sea, and other geopolitical flashpoints. 
Worried that weak ties between major militaries can lead to misunderstandings that snowball into conflict amid tense relations, U.S. officials said Mattis is attempting to forge a relationship with Chinese military leaders. 
He appears to be getting traction. On Friday, he is set to hold a third meeting with Wei in less than five months, an unusual intensity of top-level contact. Mattis' trip to China in June was the first by a U.S. defense secretary since 2014. 
    Schriver said U.S.-China talks in Washington on Friday will include ""risk reduction"" efforts that the two countries can undertake, which aim to drive down the chance of an inadvertent clash. 
""We want to make sure that as we compete that it's a benign type of competition (and) doesn't result in something catastrophic,"" he said. 
RISK OF MISHAP
New military data and recent incidents involving U.S. military activity in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait show the defense secretary is walking a fine line. Even as Mattis tries to forge ties to contain crises, the Pentagon is ramping up activity that irritates the Chinese government.
In the 12 months ending on Sept. 30, for example, there were six so-called ""Freedom of Navigation"" operations in the South China Sea, compared with four in the same period of the previous year, a U.S. official told Reuters. 
Such operations involve sending warships into international waters if they are claimed by other countries. China claims most of the South China Sea and has been militarizing islands there. 
(Tracking expansion in the South China Sea. See graphic https://tmsnrt.rs/2J3cWne)
The six operations are equivalent to what the Navy did during the last two years of President Barack Obama's administration. 
The Pentagon is also running warships through the Taiwan Strait with greater frequency and this year weighed sending an aircraft carrier through the narrow waterway, U.S. officials said. China claims Taiwan as its own and sees U.S overtures to self-ruled Taiwan as meddling in its internal affairs.
Susan Thornton, who until July was the State Department's top Asia adviser, said the increased military activity is ratcheting up the risks. 
""We are doing things that are frankly more aggressive, and the Chinese are pushing back harder than they ever have before,"" Thornton said. ""The risk of a mishap is growing."" 
Schriver acknowledged that it was hard to predict how resilient U.S.-Chinese military ties would be in an actual crisis. ""I guess we won't know until there's a crisis, and it's tested,"" he said.
""WISE MAN""
China is becoming more assertive militarily. On Sept. 30, for example, a Chinese ship came within 45 yards of a U.S. Navy destroyer in international waters in the South China Sea. The Chinese ship put bumpers on its side, suggesting it expected a possible collision when it ran the maneuver.
""You don't do that when you're out in the middle of the ocean, unless you're intending to run into something,"" Mattis told reporters last month.
At the same time, China's defense ministry has said it hopes the military relationship can become a ""stabilizer"" for overall ties, and officials have suggested that Beijing has more confidence in Mattis than some other top Trump administration officials. 
One Chinese official said Beijing regards Mattis as a ""wise man,"" experienced enough in war to know that it is best to avoid armed conflict. 
The Chinese defense ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
COMPETITOR, NOT ENEMY
Thornton said Mattis' China contacts, while helpful, would not be enough to bridge gaps elsewhere in the Trump administration in the event of a crisis. Further, if Mattis were to leave, his successor would need time to come up to speed, a dangerous prospect at a time of heightened tensions, she said. 
Mattis' departure from the cabinet has been the subject of media speculation, although both Mattis and Trump have dismissed the idea. 
When Mattis flew to Beijing in June, he got an earful from China's military about the Pentagon's decision to describe China as a ""strategic competitor"" militarizing the South China Sea in a key Pentagon policy document. 
In his closed-door talks, Mattis defended the description, saying the Pentagon chose those words carefully, knowing they would be scrutinized in Beijing, said the U.S. officials who heard the exchange.
""Competitor is not adversary. It's not enemy,"" Schriver said, explaining Mattis' position.
The two sides have met on other occasions as well for confidence-building measures. The top U.S. general, Joe Dunford, said this week that the U.S. and China held a ""table-top"" exercise about four months ago, where the two sides discussed various potential crisis scenarios. 
The goal of the exercise, Dunford said, was to reduce the risk of miscalculation during a crisis.

Speaking at a Washington event last week, Mattis said, ""I think that 15 years from now we will be remembered most for: How did we set the conditions for a positive relationship with China?""

MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines' anti-corruption court on Friday ordered the arrest of former first lady Imelda Marcos after finding her guilty on seven counts of graft during the two-decade rule of her husband and former dictator, Ferdinand Marcos.
Marcos, 89, famous for a huge collection of shoes, jewelry and artwork, is facing dozens of protracted graft cases that have hounded her since her family was toppled in an army-backed popular uprising in 1986.
The court ordered Marcos, a congresswoman, to serve six to 11 years in jail for each of the seven counts of graft. She was charged for making seven bank transfers totaling $200 million to Swiss foundations during her term as Manila governor.
Marcos and her representatives did not attend the legal hearing on Friday. She could not be reached for comment and text messages and phone calls to her lawyer were not answered.
The arrest warrant may not be executed immediately because Marcos can appeal the ruling by the Sandiganbayan court, a prosecutor said. 
""She can elevate it to the Supreme Court if she sees grave abuse of discretion in the Sandiganbayan's decision. So this is not yet final and executory,"" assistant special prosecutor Ryan Quilala told reporters, adding she can also file for an application for bail.
Under the rules of the Sandiganbayan, the former first lady has 15 days from promulgation of the ruling to file an appeal, and the anti-graft court has 30 days within which to decide on it. Marcos may also go straight to Supreme Court to seek relief. 
Marcos, who is serving her third straight term as a member of congress, has registered to contest an election to succeed her daughter, Imee Marcos, 62, as governor of Ilocos Norte, the stronghold of the still powerful Marcos family.
Imee is running for the Philippine Senate in 2019. 
""I hope this ruling would serve as a crucial electoral guide to our voters this coming election"", opposition Senator Risa Hontiveros said in a statement. 
Ferdinand Marcos ruled the Philippines for two decades, placing the country under martial law in 1972, during which time thousands of opponents were jailed, killed or disappeared.
He was accused of amassing more than $10 billion while in office and died in exile in 1989.
President Rodrigo Duterte enjoys good ties with the Marcos family and has often praised the late strongman.
Duterte allowed Marcos' embalmed body to be buried at a special heroes' cemetery in 2016, and the president is often accompanied at official events by Imee Marcos.

Duterte's spokesman, Salvador Panelo, said in a statement the ruling against Imelda Marcos was proof that the executive ""is not in the business of exerting undue interference or influence"" on courts, and therefore respects the decision.""

1463,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2018 03:00AM ET</span>","Syrian government forces, rebels clash in northwest: Observatory","BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syrian government forces clashed with rebels in Hama province on Friday in some of the heaviest fighting in the country's northwest in a year, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. 
The army and allied forces attacked insurgents near Halfaya village overnight, seizing some positions, the UK-based war monitoring group said. 
At least 22 members of the Jaish al-Izza faction died in ambushes, and dozens more were wounded, the highest casualty toll of fighters in the northwest in many months, it said. 
The Observatory said it was unclear if pro-government forces were killed.
Intermittent exchanges of fire have broken out in northwest Syria since a deal in September between Russia, a key Damascus ally, and Turkey, which has backed the opposition. 
The agreement to set up a demilitarized zone staved off an army offensive against the rebel-held Idlib region, including nearby parts of Hama and Aleppo provinces.

When asked if China was violating the 2015 agreement between then President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping, National Security Agency official Rob Joyce said: ""We think they are.""
But he added that the quantity and number of attacks had dropped ""dramatically"" since the agreement.
""While it's not black and white, (China) met the agreement or they didn't meet the agreement, it's clear that they are well beyond the bounds today of the agreement that was forged between our countries,"" Joyce said.
Speaking in Beijing on Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying rejected the U.S. allegations.
""The U.S. accusations lack factual basis. China firmly opposes them,"" she told a daily news briefing.
China and the United States have important shared interests in cyberspace, Hua said.
""We urge the U.S. side to cease its baseless criticism of China, and meet China halfway in jointly safeguarding the two countries' momentum for cooperation and communication in the realm of cybersecurity,"" she said.
In September 2015, Obama announced he had reached a ""common understanding"" with China's Xi on curbing economic cyber espionage, but threatened to impose U.S. sanctions on Chinese hackers who persist in committing cyber crimes.
The two leaders said they agreed that neither government would knowingly support cyber theft of corporate secrets or business information.
The agreement, however, stopped short of any promise to refrain from traditional government-to-government cyber spying for intelligence purposes. 
That could include the massive hack of the U.S. federal government's personnel office this year that compromised the data of more than 20 million people. U.S. officials have traced that back to China, but have not said whether they believe the Chinese government was responsible.

The United States and China will hold a delayed top-level security dialogue on Friday, the latest sign of a thaw in the countries' strained relations amid an ongoing trade row ahead of a planned meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi at the Group of 20 summit meeting in Argentina at the end of November.

The 15-month-old twins, Nima and Dawa, were joined from the chest to the pelvis. Doctors at the Royal Children's' Hospital Melbourne (RCHM) said they had to separate the girls' livers, and the main challenge was reconstructing their abdomens.
""It is a relief and it is also a joy, there's nothing better in any operation to be able to go to the parents and say we have been able to take care of your child,"" Dr. Joe Crameri, who led the 18-strong surgical team and is the head of pediatric surgery at the hospital, told a media conference.
""There will be challenges over the next 24 to 48 hours as with any surgery, and we feel quietly confident that we will have a good result,"" said Crameri.
The girls and their mother, Bhumchu Zangmo, were brought to Australia last month by the Children's First Foundation charity, which said the Victorian state government had covered the cost of the surgery while it looked after transport and accommodation.
When they arrived, the medical team said the girls needed to improve their weight and health before surgery. The girls are expected to remain in hospital for at least a week, Crameri said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong barred the Asia news editor of the Financial Times from entering the city as a visitor, the newspaper said, after authorities refused to renew his work visa in October, raising questions about the city's commitment to free speech.
Victor Mallet ""attempted to enter Hong Kong on Thursday as a visitor but was turned away at the border after several hours of questioning by immigration officers,"" the Financial Times said.
Mallet did not comment further when contacted by Reuters.
Hong Kong's government said the case had nothing to do with freedom of expression or the press.
""In considering any application for entry, we will be acting in accordance with the law and the prevailing immigration policy to make a decision,"" it said in an emailed statement on Friday. Analysts have cited the FT editor's case among other examples of Hong Kong officials taking a tough line on perceived critics and dissent in the former British colony.
On Thursday, a prominent Chinese dissident writer, Ma Jian, said on Twitter that he was told by a Hong Kong arts center that it would no longer host two of his talks as part of the Hong Kong International Literary Festival.
In Mallet's case, the government declined to renew his work visa last month after a speech he hosted at the Hong Kong Foreign Correspondents' Club (FCC) by an independence activist was strongly condemned by officials in China and Hong Kong. 
Authorities did not give a reason for the visa decision, which shocked many in the city's international community and revived a debate over promised freedoms in the financial hub.
The FCC said on its website on Friday it was ""shocked and baffled"" by Mallet's denied entry into Hong Kong.
Joshua Rosenzweig, East Asia Research Director for rights group Amnesty International, tweeted that Hong Kong's action was ""totally unacceptable and smacks of continued retaliation."" 
RIGHTS UNDER SCRUTINY
Beijing and Hong Kong authorities say independence violates the ""one country, two systems"" principle which has governed the territory since it was handed back to China in 1997.
The principle promises Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed elsewhere in China, rights which are enshrined in a mini-constitution known as the Basic Law.
The human rights situation in Hong Kong came under scrutiny in Geneva this week from several foreign governments at a United Nations hearing on rights in China.
On Thursday, exiled Chinese author Ma Jian tweeted that the Tai Kwun arts center, which was set up with government support, had canceled two events where he was to speak.
Tai Kwun director Timothy Calnin said in an emailed statement that the center ""did not want to become a platform to promote the political interests of any individual.""
Ma said he had been unable to find a Hong Kong publisher for his satirical novel, China Dream, dubbed by Hong Kong's literary festival organizers as ""Ma's answer to President Xi Jinping's goal of restored national greatness"". 
""I'm a novelist, not an activist, and am attending the Festival to discuss my new novel, China Dream. My 'politics' are simple: I believe in free thought and free speech. Without them, life has no meaning,"" Ma wrote on Twitter.

Ma is due to arrive in Hong Kong on Friday afternoon.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in has replaced his two top economic policymakers with current members of the government, his office announced on Friday, saying the changes were made to strengthen efforts to achieve a more equitable economy.
Moon has replaced chief presidential policy aide Jang Ha-sung and finance minister Kim Dong-yeon, the two most senior policymakers in charge of running Asia's fourth-largest economy, the presidential office announced.
Presidential social policy aide Kim Soo-hyun will succeed Jang and veteran bureaucrat Hong Nam-ki, currently head of the government policy co-ordination office, will be the new finance minister, the presidential office said.
""Today's appointments were intended to more strongly promote efforts to build an inclusive nation in which everyone gets better off together,"" Moon's chief spokesperson Yoon Young-chan told a televised news conference.
The outgoing finance minister, who had served since June last year, had repeatedly clashed with Jang by calling for some adjustment of the president's 'income-led growth' strategy.
Critics say Moon's signature policies, notably big minimum wage increases and a shorter work week, had backfired, with lower income earners - the intended beneficiaries - feeling the most pain as employers cut back hiring.
It was a bigger reshuffle than expected, but the appointment of their successors from within the government meant President Moon would pursue existing economic policies, which economists have said were hurting growth.
Markets gave a lukewarm reaction to what turned out to be a cosmetic and largely political event, with the country's stocks and currency both weighed down as a hawkish U.S. central bank deterred investors from holding riskier assets.
""There's not a single sign of any change in policy coming, and instead, this means the president wants the government to do the same thing more strongly,"" said Oh Suk-tae, chief Korea economist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
The incoming chief presidential policy aide has been behind harsh regulatory measures aimed at curbing housing prices, which many analysts have said were against market principles.
The incoming finance minister has served at various government departments such as the finance ministry and the presidential office. He still needs to be vetted by parliament, but its approval is not mandatory. 
A survey by Gallup Korea published on Friday showed approval ratings for Moon had fallen for four weeks running to 54 percent, way down from a high of 84 percent right after he took office in May last year following his predecessor's impeachment and removal.
South Korea's minimum wages are set to be raised by nearly 30 percent over two years and the work week has been cut by almost a quarter for big companies, but initial outcomes have been a plunge in employment rates and lower incomes. 
The economy saw growth in the July-September quarter holding steady from the previous quarter at 0.6 percent, but missing the market expectations as construction spending plunged by the most in two decades.

Private consumption held up on increased welfare support but a sharp cut in infrastructure spending and strong controls on property transactions clouded the outlook at a time when the global demand for South Korea's exports is cooling.

PARADISE, Calif. (Reuters) - A fast-moving wildfire devastated a Northern California town of 26,000 people on Thursday with authorities unsure of the casualties as they struggled to contain 150-foot flames.
Driven by strong winds and dry conditions, the blaze dubbed the Camp Fire roared through the town of Paradise, about 85 miles (240 km) north of Sacramento, forcing the population to flee in a chaotic mass evacuation.
Fire ripped through residential areas and flames leapt from hospitals and schools, according to a Reuters witness, who saw a car dealership go up in flames on a street clogged with burned out vehicles and an abandoned police cruiser. 
""The town is devastated, everything is destroyed,"" said California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) spokesman Scott Maclean, who spent much of the day in Paradise. ""There's nothing much left standing.""
The town of Chico, population 93,000, could be next in the path of the wildfire, as flames were driven westward by 35-mile-per hour (56 km-per-hour) winds, said Butte County Fire Chief Darren Read.
""We have received reports of some fatalities. Those reports have not yet been verified,"" Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea told a news conference.
The fire was the fiercest of several wind-driven blazes across California on Thursday, during one of the state's worst years for wildfires.
""The whole town is burning,"" Bob Van Camp, a Paradise resident who escaped on his motorbike, told local TV channel Action News Now. ""We had to ride through flames to get here,"" he said from the road between Paradise and Chico.
With the town located on a ridge and limited escape routes, traffic accidents turned roads into gridlock. Residents abandoned vehicles and ran from the flames carrying children and pets, officials said. One woman stuck in traffic went into labor, the Enterprise-Record newspaper reported.
""It’s very chaotic. It’s a very bad fire,” Officer Ryan Lambert of the California Highway Patrol said of the evacuation. 
The blaze began early on Thursday and had charred 20,000 acres (8,093 hectares) by 8 p.m. (11.00 p.m. ET), said Cal Fire spokesman Rick Carhart.
Rescuers used a bulldozer to push abandoned cars out the way to reach Feather River Hospital and evacuate patients as flames engulfed the building, Butte County Supervisor Doug Teeter told reporters.
The hospital was totally destroyed, Mike Mangas, a spokesman for operator Dignity Health, told Action News Now. 
Firefighting aircraft were unable to operate due to high winds, which were forecast to strengthen on Friday morning. 

""The problem is the winds that pushed the fire so much, so fast,"" said Maclean, adding that it could be days before authorities knew the full extent of fatalities and destruction.

1470,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2018 12:53AM ET</span>",U.S. to restrict e-cigarette flavors to fight teenage vaping 'epidemic',"By Chris Kirkham
(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration next week will issue a ban on the sale of fruit and candy flavored electronic cigarettes in convenience stores and gas stations, an agency official said, in a move to counter a surge in teenage use of e-cigarettes.
The ban means only tobacco, mint and menthol flavors can be sold at these outlets, the agency official said, potentially dealing a major blow to Juul Labs Inc, the San Francisco-based market leader in vape devices.
The FDA also will introduce stricter age-verification requirements for online sales of e-cigarettes. The FDA’s planned restrictions, first reported by The Washington Post and confirmed to Reuters by the official, do not apply to vape shops or other specialty retail stores.
There has been mounting pressure for action after preliminary federal data showed teenage use had surged by more than 75 percent since last year, and the FDA has described it as an ""epidemic"".
""E-cigs have become an almost ubiquitous ‒ and dangerous ‒ trend among teens,"" FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in September. ""The disturbing and accelerating trajectory of use we're seeing in youth, and the resulting path to addiction, must end. It's simply not tolerable."" 
That growth has coincided with the rise of Juul, whose sales of vaping devices grew from 2.2 million in 2016 to 16.2 million devices last year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The agency threatened in September to ban Juul and four other leading e-cigarette products unless their makers took steps to prevent use by minors. The FDA gave Juul and four big tobacco companies 60 days to submit plans to curb underage use, a compliance period that is now ending.
The planned restrictions on flavors in convenience stores are likely to have the biggest impact on Juul, which sells nicotine liquid pods in flavors such as mango, mint, fruit and creme, previously called creme brulee.
The only other e-cigarette competitors sold at convenience stores are those marketed primarily by tobacco companies such as  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) Inc,  British American Tobacco  (LON:BATS) Plc, Imperial Brands (LON:IMB) Plc and Japan Tobacco Inc .
Those products, sold under the MarkTen, blu, Vuse and Logic brands, have lost market share as Juul has risen to prominence over the last year, growing from 13.6 percent of the U.S. e-cigarette market in early 2017 to nearly 75 percent now, according to a  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analysis of Nielsen retail data.
E-cigarette products represent a small share of revenue for major tobacco companies, whereas Juul’s business is built entirely on the vaping devices. Revenue from e-cigarette devices made up less than 1 percent of British American Tobacco’s global revenue for the first six months of 2018, according to a company filing from July.
Altria last month announced it would stop selling its pod-based electronic cigarettes, generally smaller devices that use pre-filled nicotine liquid cartridges, in response to the FDA’s concerns about teen usage. The company also said it would restrict flavors for its other e-cigarette products to tobacco, menthol and mint.
Representatives from Altria, British American Tobacco, Imperial Brands and Japan Tobacco did not respond to requests for comment Thursday evening. A Juul spokeswoman declined to comment.
The companies have previously said their products are intended for adult use and that they work to ensure retailers comply with the law.
Juul has previously said the company wants to be ""part of the solution in keeping e-cigarettes out of the hands of young people"" but that ""appropriate flavors play an important role in helping adult smokers switch.""
Meredith Berkman, a founder of Parents Against Vaping E-cigarettes, which seeks to curb underage use, said the agency’s move was a “good first step,"" but added that ""the final step should have happened yesterday.""
""Why not do away with flavors altogether, why not do away with online sales altogether?"" she said. 
E-cigarettes have been a divisive topic in the public health community. Some focus on the potential for the products to shift lifelong smokers onto less harmful nicotine products, while others fear they risk drawing a new generation into nicotine addiction.

Last year the FDA, under Gottlieb, extended until 2022 a deadline for e-cigarette companies to comply with new federal rules on marketing and public health.

The mass grave was found during an investigation of a former administrator of the Somali region who is facing trial on charges of human rights abuses and stoking clashes, the Fana Broadcasting Corporation said late on Thursday, quoting police officials.
It did not give further details.
Abdi Mohammed Omer was forced to resign on Aug. 6 and was arrested weeks later after violence broke out in the provincial capital, Jijiga.
Rights groups have routinely accused his administration of abuses such as torture, while some witnesses claimed he had ordered paramilitary raids on civilians in neighboring Oromiya province after ethnic clashes there last September.
The region has been plagued by violence for decades as the government fought the secessionist Ogaden National Liberation Front before both sides signed a peace deal last month.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - North Korea postponed talks with the United States on Thursday ""because they weren't ready,"" U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said as she urged Pyongyang to implement a June deal between the two countries.
Speaking to reporters before and after a closed-door U.N. Security Council meeting on North Korea sanctions, Haley said it is now North Korea's turn to act. She also criticized Russia for trying to lift banking restrictions that are intended to curb the Asian nation's nuclear program.
""There's no time to stall or no time to delay or try and get past not going through with what was agreed in Singapore,"" said Haley, who will step down at the end of the year. 
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump pledged to work toward denuclearization at their landmark June summit in Singapore. But the agreement was short on specifics and negotiations have made little headway.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had been due to meet North Korean officials in New York on Thursday, but the State Department said on Wednesday it would be postponed to a later date. It gave no reason for the delay.
The North Korean mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment. 
Describing the relationship between Washington and Pyongyang as ""cordial,"" Haley said she did not think there was a ""major issue"" and she believed the talks would be rescheduled. 
The U.N. Security Council met to discuss sanctions on North Korea on Thursday at the request of Russia. Haley has accused Russia of cheating on U.N. sanctions on North Korea.
After the short meeting, she told reporters Russia is looking to lift banking restrictions, which she said they are not following appropriately.
""We're concerned about the humanitarian situation in North Korea, but the truth always comes out,"" she said. ""So now we know what their agenda is, we know exactly why they're trying to do it and we're not going to let it happen.""
Russia's envoy did not speak to reporters after exiting the meeting. The Russian U.N. mission issued a statement later saying North Korea faces ""serious humanitarian problems"" due to the U.N. sanctions resolutions and urged the Security Council to fix the problem.
""We consider such a situation to be absolutely unacceptable and actually violating the decisions of the council as they should not be directed against the population of the DPRK (North Korea) or the activity of humanitarian agencies,"" the Russian mission said.
AID IN LIMBO
Several requests by humanitarian groups for approval to ship aid goods to North Korea have been in limbo for months after the United States repeatedly asked for more time to consider them, an issue some diplomats had planned to raise in Thursday's meeting, according to documents seen by Reuters. 
The U.N. Security Council has unanimously backed sanctions since 2006 to choke off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Aid groups, however, can request exemptions to send humanitarian assistance to the impoverished, isolated Asian state. 
Requests are made to the 15-member Security Council's North Korea sanctions committee, which operates by consensus. 
China and Russia have said the Security Council should reward Pyongyang for ""positive developments"" this year. But the United States and other Western powers say sanctions must be enforced until there is full denuclearization. 
""We have given a lot of carrots up until now. We're not going to get rid of the stick because they have not done anything to warrant getting rid of the sanctions yet,"" Haley said. 
According to committee documents, a September request by a U.S.-based charity and August requests by an Ireland-based aid group and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) have yet to be given the green light. 

""Our goal is to make sure that we don't do anything if it's going to be compromised and not go to the people,"" Haley said. ""If it can be used in a different way, if we think they'll use if for another purpose, we are taking our time in vetting that very carefully.""

The BNDES is the largest development lender in the Americas with a loan book larger than the World Bank's. Under the leftist Workers Party governments in recent years it financed projects in many Latin American and African countries.
Bolsonaro, a former Army captain turned nationalist politician who takes office on Jan. 1, criticized the BNDES during the election campaign for funding projects that had nothing to do with Brazil's national interests, such as the container terminal at communist-run Cuba's port of Mariel.
""I will begin my mandate determined to open the black box of the BNDES and reveal to the Brazilian people what was done with their money,"" he said in Thursday's tweet.
In 2011, the BNDES disbursed in Brazil, Latin America and Africa funds totaling $83 billion, more than the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund put together. Lending dropped off due to Brazil's deep 2015-2016 economic recession and a graft investigation into the county's top engineering and construction conglomerates that were among the banks main private borrowers. 
The bank declined to comment on Bolsonaro's vow to probe its lending transactions.
The BNDES' employees association said in a statement that the bank published ample information about its operations on its website and followed the law regarding bank secrecy.
The bank reports its accounts regularly to Brazil's securities and exchange commission and the controller general and federal accounts court, besides being the target of three congressional inquiries that did not find any irregularities, the association said.
""Until today, there has been no evidence that could link BNDES employees to any corruption scheme,"" it said.
A BNDES official told Reuters that the bank's operations where open and transparent and had nothing to hide.
""The bank has no black box. Nobody here fears anything and nobody feels threatened or guilty,"" the source said, requesting anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about the matter. 

In 2016, BNDES temporarily froze disbursements worth $4.7 billion for several engineering firms ensnared in Brazil’s biggest corruption investigation, the Car Wash probe into overpriced contracts with oil company Petróleo Brasileiro SA. The suspension affected projects in Argentina, Cuba, Venezuela, Guatemala, Honduras, the Dominican Republic, Angola, Mozambique and Ghana.

1474,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2018 06:43PM ET</span>",Trump administration moves to curb migrants' asylum claims,"By Yeganeh Torbati and Kristina Cooke
WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The Trump administration unveiled new rules on Thursday to sharply limit migrant asylum claims by barring individuals who cross the U.S. southern border illegally from seeking asylum.
Immigrant advocates denounced the move, saying it violated existing U.S. law that allows people fleeing persecution and violence in their home countries to apply for asylum regardless of whether they enter illegally or not.
The regulations released on Thursday, in conjunction with an order expected to be signed by President Donald Trump, would effectively ban migrants who cross the U.S. border with Mexico illegally from qualifying for asylum.
Once the plan goes into full effect, migrants entering at the U.S. southern border would only be eligible for asylum if they report at official ports of entry, officials said.
""What we are attempting to do is trying to funnel ... asylum claims through the ports of entry where we are better resourced, have better capabilities and better manpower and staffing to actually handle those claims in an expeditious and efficient manner,"" a senior administration official told reporters in a news briefing on Thursday, on condition of anonymity.
The Trump administration has already made it more difficult for migrants to qualify for asylum in the United States. Administration officials have said existing U.S. asylum rules encourage illegal immigration and bog down legitimate claims.
In June, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued an appellate decision that sharply narrowed the circumstances under which immigrants can use violence at home as grounds for U.S. asylum. 
Sessions, who resigned at Trump's request this week, also instructed immigration judges and asylum officers to view illegal border-crossing as a ""serious adverse factor"" in deciding a case and to consider whether applicants could have escaped danger by relocating within their own countries.
Trump made his hard-line policies toward immigration a key issue ahead of Tuesday's midterm elections, sending thousands of U.S. troops to help secure the southern border and repeatedly drawing attention to a caravan of Central American migrants trekking through Mexico toward the United States.
Currently, U.S. asylum rules do not bar people who enter the country without authorization, and the Immigration and Nationality Act, which governs the U.S. immigration system, specifically allows people who arrive in the United States, whether or not they do so at a designated port of entry, to apply for asylum.
The administration's plan, which invokes the same authority Trump used to justify his travel ban on citizens of several Muslim-majority nations, is likely to be quickly challenged in court.
The move would largely affect migrants from Central America's Northern Triangle - Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador - who cross the U.S. border with Mexico to flee violence and poverty in their home countries.
""The vast majority of aliens who enter illegally today come from the Northern Triangle countries,"" the regulation's text says. ""Channeling those aliens to ports of entry would encourage these aliens to first avail themselves of offers of asylum from Mexico."" 
Immigrant advocates denounced the administration's move as unlawful, and said the plan to funnel migrants to ports of entry was just a way to cut asylum claims overall.
""Congress has directly spoken to this question as to whether individuals can be rendered ineligible for asylum if they cross between ports of entry and has specifically said people are eligible regardless of where they cross,"" said Lee Gelernt, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union.

""Ports of entry ... are overcrowded,"" said Jonathan Ryan, executive director of RAICES, a Texas-based immigrant defense group. ""Asylum-seekers have been left to camp out for days and weeks on bridges at the border, when they should be guaranteed a right to enter the country for a fair hearing.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A ""frank"" exchange of views can be expected in top-level diplomatic and security talks between the United States and China on Friday, including on issues such as human rights and the South China Sea, the U.S. ambassador to China said.
Terry Branstad told reporters at the State Department on Thursday that the United States would seek progress on priority issues, including North Korea, and that there would also be discussions on strategic security and how ""to avoid mistakes or accidents that can happen in the military arena.""
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will take part in the talks in Washington, with Chinese politburo member Yang Jiechi and Defense Minister Wei Fenghe. They were supposed to have been held in Beijing in October but were delayed amid rising tension over trade, Taiwan and the South China Sea.
While the focus will be on diplomacy and security, moves to try to resolve a damaging trade war between the two countries are expected to be touched upon ahead of a planned meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 in Argentina at the end of November.
""We want this to be a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China,"" Branstad said. ""The U.S. is not trying to contain China but we want fairness and reciprocity.""
China and the United States have put tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other's goods and Trump has threatened to set tariffs on the remainder of China's $500 billion-plus exports to the United States if the dispute cannot be resolved.
A resumption of high-level dialogue, marked by a phone call last week between the presidents, has raised some hopes, but the Trump administration has also accused China of interfering in U.S. politics, charges China strongly denies. The two have also sparred over the disputed South China Sea and self-ruled Taiwan, which China claims. 
Washington has also been increasingly critical of Chinese treatment of religious minorities, including Uighur Muslims in the western Chinese region of Xinjiang.
""The diplomatic and security dialogue is a forum for a frank, open exchange of views on a full range of issues from the South China Sea, to human rights,"" Branstad.
He noted Beijing's cooperation on a range of international issues, calling it a ""very key player"" in getting North Korea back to negotiations.
Discussion is also expected on Friday of U.S. plans to quit the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia, which has sparked Chinese worries that it could lead to the stationing of U.S. land-based missiles in Asia.
Xi Jinping said on Thursday that China wants to resolve problems through talks, but Washington must respect Beijing's choice of development path and interests.
China's Foreign Ministry said Yang Jiechi met U.S. national security adviser John Bolton on Wednesday and said the two sides should ""properly manage differences and carefully prepare to ensure positive results in the Argentina meeting.""

""China is committed to working with the U.S. to achieve a no-confrontational, conflict-free, mutually respectful co-operation in which both sides win,"" it quoted Yang as saying.

Europe's only nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the 260-metre-long (850-ft) vessel, which carries 1,700 personnel and whose tonnage is equal to four Eiffel Towers, is due to be deployed in early February in the Indian Ocean, according to military sources.
Its mid-life upgrade, costing 1.3 billion euros, largely focused on modernizing facilities for landing and guiding aircraft. That came after heavy use given the retirement of Britain's carrier and intense operations between 2015-2016 in the fight against Islamic State militants.
President Emmanuel Macron will spend a night on the vessel next week as it ramps up its five-week pre-deployment training phase.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, warned on Thursday against rising tensions between Russia and the United States and said there should be no return to the Cold War. 
The frail 87-year-old was physically helped by aides to a cinema hall to watch the premiere in Russia of a new documentary about his life, his Soviet reforms in the 1980s and his arms control drive that helped end the Cold War. 
His legacy has come under a pall as ties between Moscow and Washington have fallen to post-Cold War lows, following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and rows over sanctions, election meddling and the poisoning of a spy in England. 
He spoke briefly to a cinema hall in Moscow after ""Meeting Gorbachev"", a new documentary directed by filmmakers Werner Herzog and Andre Singer, and was asked if the world would hold back from a new Cold War. 
""We must hold back,"" he said. ""And not just from the Cold War. We have to continue the course we mapped. We have to ban war once and for all. Most important is to get rid of nuclear weapons.""
Reviled by many Russians as the man whose reforms ultimately led to the Soviet breakup, Gorbachev is lauded in the West as the man who helped end the Cold War. 
Gorbachev, whose visibly ailing health was in stark contrast to the vigorous reformist figure he cut in the 1980s, said the world was moving dangerously closer to a new arms race.
Last month in a column for the New York Times, Gorbachev denounced the United States after President Donald Trump said he planned to quit the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty which Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan signed in 1987.
The pact eliminated all short- and intermediate-range land-based nuclear and conventional missiles held by both countries in Europe. 
In a prepared, written message read out to the hall by an aide before the film, Gorbachev alluded to the article and said ""I am convinced we can stop a new Cold War. I will do everything for this."" 

""Most dangerous would be a return to confrontation, the start of a new arms race. They are already talking about a nuclear war as if this is something entirely acceptable. It is being prepared, scenarios are being discussed.""

One of the entities sanctioned - the Limited Liability Company Southern (NYSE:SO) Project - was linked to Bank Rossiya and Russian businessman Yuri Kovulchuk, the Treasury Department said.
Kovulchuk, whom the United States government has called ""the personal banker"" for senior Russian officials, is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and was previously sanctioned by the United States over the Crimea crisis.
""Treasury remains committed to targeting Russian-backed entities that seek to profit from Russia's illegal annexation and occupation of Crimea,"" Sigal Mandelker, Treasury's under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a statement.
The sanctions, bought under a 2017 U.S. law known as the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, or CAATSA, aim to further punish Moscow for seizing control of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in March 2014 after Moscow-backed Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich fled power after months of street protests. 
The takeover began in late February when Russian troops without insignia appeared in various parts of Crimea, mostly outside Ukrainian military bases and government buildings.
The new sanctions are unacceptable and such attempts to influence Moscow are doomed to fail, TASS news agency reported Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov as saying on Thursday.
Among those blacklisted is Andriy Sushko, an officer from Russia's Federal Security Service. The Treasury Department said he was responsible for the abduction of a Crimean Tatar activist in 2017, who was tortured while being held.
The sanctions also target companies that the Treasury said benefited from the annexation of Crimea. Among them is the Mriya Resort and Spa, a hotel investment bankrolled by Russia's largest bank, Sberbank, on the South Shore of Crimea in the city of Yalta, the department said.

Also blacklisted was the Ministry of State Security of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic, the Treasury said.

1480,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2018 04:09PM ET</span>",U.S. appeals court rules against Trump on DACA immigration program,"By Tom Hals
(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court in California ruled on Thursday that President Donald Trump's administration must continue a program begun under former President Barack Obama that protects hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants who were brought into the country as children.
The decision by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals preserves the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program introduced in 2012 that has shielded from deportation a group of immigrants dubbed ""Dreamers"" and has given them work permits, though not a path to citizenship. 
Trump has taken a stern stance against illegal immigration. His administration announced plans in September 2017 to phase out DACA, arguing that Obama exceeded his constitutional powers when he bypassed Congress and created the program. DACA currently protects roughly 700,000 young adults, mostly Hispanics, with the number previously as high as about 800,000 people.
The three-judge panel unanimously upheld a federal judge's January injunction maintaining the program, rejecting the administration's claim that the decision to end DACA was not reviewable by the courts.
The ruling stems from a lawsuit brought by the University of California, the states of California, Maine, Maryland and Minnesota and others challenging Trump's move to end DACA.
The judges said the plaintiffs made a plausible case that the Republican president's plan violates the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law. The plaintiffs provided evidence of ""discriminatory motivation, including the rescission order's disparate impact on Latinos and persons of Mexican heritage,"" Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw write in the opinion. 
Wardlaw was appointed by Democratic former President Bill Clinton. The other two judges, John Owens and Jacqueline Nguyen, were appointed by Obama, a Democrat. Wardlaw and Nguyen also said the plaintiffs would likely win on their claim that rescinding DACA would violate federal administrative law. 
The ruling represented another legal defeat for Trump concerning DACA, although he has won court victories on other parts of his tough immigration policies.
""Another federal court has said what we've always known: that Trump's decision to kill DACA was wrong and that his sole motivation was to deport 800,000 people of color,"" said Sanaa Abrar of the group United We Dream, which advocates for DACA recipients.
On Monday, the administration took the unusual step of asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case even though the appeals court had yet to rule.
Trump said on Wednesday he saw potential to work with Democrats, who won control of the House of Representatives this week, but would have to see how the Supreme Court rules on the issue.
The ruling was the first by a federal appellate court to review the merits of the decision to rescind DACA.
'FAR FROM OVER'
""In California and across our nation, Dreamers significantly enrich our communities as scholars, entrepreneurs, first responders and much more,"" said Xavier Becerra, California's Democratic attorney general. ""This fight, of course, is far from over. We will continue to defend Dreamers and DACA all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary.""
The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge William Alsup decided in January the government must continue processing renewals of existing DACA applications while litigation over the legality of Trump's action is resolved. The administration in February unsuccessfully appealed Alsup's ruling to the Supreme Court.
Trump's move last year had called for DACA to begin winding down this past March. Trump's action sparked an outcry from immigration advocates, business groups, colleges and some religious leaders. There are about 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States, according to the Pew Research Center. 
Lawsuits both challenging and supporting Trump's decision to end DACA have been working their way through the courts, making it likely the issue will wind up in front of the Supreme Court.
The 9th Circuit ruling does not impact a nationwide injunction to preserve DACA issued by U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn in February, which also has been appealed.
A federal judge in Washington in August ordered the administration to fully restore DACA, including taking new applications. That decision was stayed pending appeal.

Legislation to extend protections for DACA recipients and provide them a path to citizenship failed in Congress this year.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan said on Thursday it was in talks with Washington and Moscow to empty a desert camp used by 50,000 displaced Syrians, a move aimed at defusing security tensions near a potential military flashpoint on its northeast border with Syria.
Jordan's foreign ministry said the kingdom backed a Russian plan to arrange the voluntary return of the inhabitants of Rukban camp to their home areas in eastern Syria following their recapture by the Syrian government from Islamic State.
""Jordanian-U.S.-Russian talks have begun with the aim of finding a fundamental solution to Rukban by ensuring the right conditions of their voluntary return to their cities and towns,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed al Qatarneh said.
""Jordan supports the Russian plan to create the conditions that allow the emptying of the camp,"" he said in a statement. 
He did not elaborate.
Intelligence sources say the Russian plan entails negotiating with Syrian tribal leaders and former Western-backed rebels sheltering in the camp area to provide safe passage for returnees to go to opposition areas in northern Syria, and to help those who want to go their homes in state-held areas. 
Many camp inhabitants are not ready to go back to homes in state-held areas for fear of being drafted for conscription, tribal figures in the camp say. 
Developments at Rukban are watched closely around the region because it is near a U.S. garrison in southeastern Syria at Tanf on the Iraq-Syria border. The camp falls within a so-called deconfliction zone set up by the Pentagon to try to shield the Tanf garrison from attacks by pro-government forces.
Damascus says the U.S. forces are occupying Syrian territory and providing a safe-haven in that area for rebels it deems terrorists. 
Jordan officials have repeatedly said they suspect the camp is infiltrated with IS sleeper cells, a security nightmare that has haunted Amman since an IS militant in 2016 drove a car bomb into a Jordanian military border post, killing seven guards.
In the last three years, tens of thousands of Syrians trekked to the camp where the borders of Syria, Jordan and Iraq meet. They fled expanded Russian and U.S.-led coalition air strikes against IS-held areas in central and eastern Syria.
Intelligence sources say a siege of the camp last month by the Syrian army that depleted food stores in the compound and raised the specter of starvation was aimed at piling pressure on Washington.
Russia's defense ministry in August repeated an accusation that Washington has been harboring Islamic State militants within the zone.
Washington however responded to growing Russian pressure by conducting rare military exercises in the base last month, and General Joseph Votel, head of U.S. Central Command, made an unannounced visit to Tanf.
Tanf lies on the strategic Damascus-Baghdad highway, once a major supply route for Iranian weapons into Syria. This makes the base a bulwark against Iran and part of a larger campaign against Iranian influence in the Middle East.

The bill would permit companies to grow and commercialize marijuana. People would also be allowed to cultivate plants for private use, as long as they register in an anonymous government listing and produce no more than 480 grams (1 lb) of marijuana per year. (https:// Smoking pot in public places would also be permitted. Olga Sanchez, designated interior minister of President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, said prohibition has fed violence and poverty, criticizing a 12-year crackdown on drug gangs that has claimed tens of thousands of lives. ""Today, the nation has taken the decision to change,"" she told senators. ""We don't want more deaths. It will be a major contribution to bringing peace to our beloved country."" Mexico would join Canada and Uruguay in allowing recreational marijuana use, as well as 10 U.S. states. Under the Mexican bill, cannabis producers would be banned from hiring minors or selling the drug to them. Lopez Obrador, a veteran leftist who takes office Dec. 1, has promised major changes to Mexico's security strategy, suggesting a negotiated peace and amnesty for some of the very people currently targeted by security forces. The coalition led by his National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) party has a majority in both houses, and other parties have also signaled support for marijuana legalization. The mounting violence of recent years and gradual legalization of the drug in U.S. states has fueled support for a change in policy in Mexico. Prominent backers of allowing marijuana use include former Mexican President Vicente Fox. Since late 2006, Mexico has used the armed forces to fight drug gangs, which are major suppliers of illegal marijuana to the United States. The gangs have splintered as they battled over trafficking routes and territory, fueling violence. 
More than 31,000 murders were registered in Mexico last year, according to government data, the highest total since modern records began.

Mayor Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz had banned the annual march, saying Warsaw had ""suffered enough due to aggressive nationalism"".

1484,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2018 02:26PM ET</span>",Whitaker’s friendship with Trump aide reignites recusal debate,"By Ginger Gibson and Julia Harte
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's pick for acting attorney general, Matt Whitaker, is a close friend of Trump's 2016 election campaign co-chair, and a former government ethics chief said the friendship makes Whitaker unable to oversee impartially a politically charged investigation into the campaign. 
Matthew Whitaker, named on Wednesday to replace Jeff Sessions, will directly oversee Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller's investigation into possible links between Trump's campaign team and Russian officials. 
Whitaker publicly criticized Mueller’s investigation before he was hired as Sessions’ chief of staff last year.
Sam Clovis, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 campaign and has testified before the grand jury in the Mueller investigation, said he and Whitaker became good friends when they ran against each other as Republicans in a 2014 Senate primary campaign in Iowa. Whitaker also later served as the chairman of a Clovis campaign for state treasurer.
In an interview with Reuters, Clovis said Whitaker is ""a wonderful man"" and ""a dear friend."" He added that Whitaker was a “sounding board” for him when Clovis worked for Trump’s campaign.
Walter Shaub, who was director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics for four years before resigning in July 2017, said the friendship between Whitaker and Clovis should disqualify Whitaker from supervising the Mueller investigation.  
""Whitaker has to recuse himself under DOJ's regulation requiring recusal if you have a personal or political relationship with someone substantially involved in conduct that is the subject of the investigation or prosecution,"" Shaub told Reuters.  
Department of Justice spokesperson Sarah Isgur Flores declined to comment. 
A DOJ regulation cited by Shaub states that employees ""may not supervise prosecutions or investigations that involve someone with a personal or political relationship.""
It says the possible conflict can be set aside if the employee's supervisor judges that the relationship does not affect the official's impartiality or create the public perception of a conflict. 
Trevor Potter, a former Republican commissioner on the Federal Election Commission who now leads the Campaign Legal Center, which advocates for more transparency in elections, said the question of whether Whitaker should recuse himself depends on Clovis’ status in the Mueller investigation.
“If he has a close personal friendship with someone who is involved in the investigation because of his role in the Trump campaign, then that would present a recusal issue,” Potter said. 
Mueller has not publicly identified any of the targets of his investigation.
Paul Rosenzweig, a fellow at the non-partisan R Street Institute which specializes in public policy, said he believed Whitaker’s friendship with Clovis is “probably not a problem” but that Whitaker should ask the DOJ’s Professional Responsibility and Accountability Office whether he has a conflict.
While he still led the government ethics office, Shaub last year advised the Justice Department to require Sessions' recusal from the Mueller probe because Sessions had been a senior adviser to Trump during the election campaign.
Sessions’ decision to recuse himself infuriated Trump. After months of publicly criticizing his attorney general, Trump asked him to resign on Wednesday.   
The White House did not respond to a request for comment.
Whitaker's selection by Trump as acting attorney general drew sharp criticism from Democratic lawmakers, who described it as an attempt by the president to undermine and possibly end Mueller’s investigation.        
Mueller’s team has netted convictions and guilty pleas from several Trump campaign staff members and advisers.
Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia, and describes Mueller's investigation as a ""witch hunt.""
Moscow has denied U.S. security agencies' allegations that it interfered in the election in a bid to help Trump.
A former U.S. attorney and conservative commentator, Whitaker last year wrote an opinion piece for CNN arguing that Mueller would be going too far if he investigated the Trump family's finances.

Two months after the article was published, Whitaker went to work at the Department of Justice.

1485,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Khashoggi murder further complicates 'Arab NATO' plan - U.S. sources,"By Jonathan Landay and Yara Bayoumy
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's strategy to contain Iranian power in the Middle East by forging Arab allies into a U.S.-backed security alliance was in trouble even before the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Now, three U.S. sources said, the plan faces fresh complications.
Khashoggi's murder on Oct. 2 in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul has drawn international outrage against Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, with Turkish officials and some U.S. lawmakers accusing the kingdom's de facto ruler of ordering the killing.
The Middle East Strategic Alliance (MESA) aims to bind Sunni Muslim governments in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, Egypt and Jordan in a U.S.-led security, political and economic pact to counter Shi'ite Iran. 
But feuds among Arab allies, especially a Saudi-led economic and political boycott of Qatar, have hampered the founding of the alliance since Riyadh proposed it last year.
A summit meeting in the United States where Trump and the Arab leaders would sign a preliminary accord on the alliance was expected in January. But the three U.S. sources and a Gulf diplomat said the meeting now looks uncertain. It has already been postponed several times, they added. 
Khashoggi's murder raised ""a whole bunch of problems"" to be solved before the plan - informally referred to as the ""Arab NATO"" - can move forward, one U.S. source said. One issue is how the Americans could have the Saudi crown prince, who goes by the initials MbS, attend the summit without causing widespread outrage.
""It's not palatable,"" the source said.
A senior Trump administration official denied on Tuesday that Khashoggi's death complicated progress on the alliance, saying that MESA ""is much larger than one country and one issue.""
Saudi Arabia has denied MbS' involvement in Khashoggi's killing and said an investigation into responsibility was underway.
Robert Malley, a top Middle East adviser to former President Barack Obama who now heads the International Crisis Group, a conflict prevention organization, said it would be difficult for MbS to attend a January summit ""given what happened and how raw the feelings are.""
""I'm not sure he would want to come to the United States right now,"" Malley said.
Retired Marine General Anthony Zinni, the administration's chief MESA negotiator, said the initiative ""is moving forward"" but added that the impact of Khashoggi's death was unclear.
""I don't know yet how it will affect the process. Awaiting final investigation and decisions,"" Zinni told Reuters in a recent email. ""I think there may be a wait until the investigation (maybe forensics if a body is found) is complete before a way forward is discussed.""
The eight potential alliance members did not respond to requests for comment about their commitment to MESA. 
        
MANY HURDLES
Even before the fallout from Khashoggi's killing complicated matters, two classified White House documents seen by Reuters show the administration was grappling for ways to overcome regional feuds and push MESA forward in order to contain Iran as well as to limit Chinese and Russian influence in the region.
""Our regional partners are increasingly competing and, in the case of the Qatar rift, entering into outright competition to the detriment of American interests and to the benefit of Iran, Russia and China,"" National Security Adviser John Bolton wrote to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in a letter late summer, before Khashoggi's death.
""To arrest these negative trends, we need to change our partners' strategic calculus,"" Bolton wrote in the undated letter, written in response to a June 29 memo about MESA from Pompeo and Mattis.
Three U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there has been a debate within the administration about whether Washington can persuade Arab allies to put aside their differences, with Bolton emerging as a key proponent for the plan.
A fourth U.S. official said the broad goals of MESA are widely shared within the administration, but there are discussions over the best approach for reaching a deal.
A Defense Department spokeswoman referred questions to the State Department but pointed out previous Mattis comments in support of the alliance.     
A State Department official said the administration continued to ""engage with our partners on working toward"" the alliance.
WHITE HOUSE PLAN       
The administration's plan is aimed at furthering Trump's ""America First"" strategy to reduce foreign military engagements and have allies shoulder more of the burden for their own security, while advancing U.S. interests in the Middle East, according to one of the White House documents.
U.S. interests in the region range from arms sales and striking Islamist extremists in Yemen, Iraq and Syria to ensuring the free flow of oil to global markets in order to keep prices stable.
One White House document, drafted before Khashoggi's death, said Trump had warned the leaders of Saudi Arabia and the other members of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) as well as Egypt that ""the status quo is untenable and that the United States will not continue to invest in Middle East security"" if they did not resolve their disputes. 
It did not give details of Trump's threat or when he made it.
Washington deploys aircraft, warships and more than 30,000 military personnel at bases in the GCC countries. Senior U.S. military officials say they have no intentions to change that posture.
The strategy paper, titled ""The Middle East Strategic Alliance Concept Overview,"" calls for a series of short- and medium-term measures requiring ""very little, if any, new U.S. resource commitments to the region.""
The measures include developing regional ""operational centers"" aimed at integrating forces in areas such as missile defense, ground warfare and other fields, according to the paper and a source familiar with the plan.
A long-term goal would be a formal treaty alliance and a multilateral free-trade pact negotiated over perhaps five to seven years, the paper said. It also raised the possibility that the pact could eventually include Iraq, Lebanon and other countries, and formal ties could be forged with Israel and ""select European and Asian allies.""  

Without those ""end-states,"" the paper said, ""our regional partners are unlikely to fully commit.""

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - United Nations Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths is no longer aiming to convene the country's warring parties for peace talks by the end of this month and will instead try to bring them together by the end of the year, a U.N. spokesman said on Thursday.
Griffiths, who is due to brief the Security Council on Nov. 16, is trying to salvage peace talks that collapsed in September. He said in a statement last week that he hoped to bring the parties to the negotiating table within a month.
However, U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said the goal now was for political consultations before the end of the year.
A proxy war is playing out in Yemen between Iran and Saudi Arabia. A Saudi-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Iran-allied Houthi group. Iran has denied supplying weapons to the Houthis.
The United States and Britain last week stepped up calls for an end to the nearly four-year war that has driven impoverished Yemen to the verge of famine, raising pressure on Saudi Arabia as it faces a global outcry over the murder of a prominent Saudi journalist in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.
""There's always different challenges to bringing the parties together,"" Haq told reporters. ""What we're trying to do is clear up any issues so that we can get a successful round of talks as soon as possible.""
An attempt to hold peace talks in Geneva in September was abandoned after three days of waiting for the Houthi delegation. 
The Houthis had said they wanted guarantees from the United Nations that their plane would not have to stop in Djibouti for inspection by the Saudi-led coalition. They also wanted the plane to evacuate some of their wounded to Oman or Europe.
Houthi fighters battled Saudi-led forces in Yemen's port city of Hodeidah on Thursday and posted gunmen on the roof of a hospital, leaving doctors and young patients in the line of fire, rights groups and military sources said.
British foreign minister Jeremy Hunt said on Monday he would push for new action at the U.N. Security Council to try to end hostilities in Yemen and find a political solution.

U.N. diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Britain was working with the United States on a draft resolution to stop the fighting in Yemen.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Is there a cure for death?
Some Silicon Valley billionaires are looking for it - or at least a way to extend life spans dramatically, perhaps by hundreds of years.
One scientist sponsored a $1 million contest - the Palo Alto Longevity Prize - for researchers who can stop aging. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google has a business called Calico, also focused on extending life spans. Entrepreneur Peter Thiel, a cofounder of  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL), has funded anti-aging research and has even declared himself against death. ""Basically, I'm against it,"" he told a British journalist a few years ago.
Marc Freedman, however, has a more down-to-earth idea about immortality. The founder of the encore career movement has just published a wonderful new book called ""How to Live Forever: The Enduring Power of Connecting the Generations"" (Public Affairs). Freedman is aiming to kick-start a national conversation about ways that today’s older generation can live on through young people. 
“Silicon Valley is trying to conquer the wrong problem in the wrong way,” he told me in an interview. “Real happiness comes from having a sense of purpose - and not defeating death, but accepting it and living accordingly. We need to accept and embrace mortality with the wisdom that we are a species that can live on not just literally, but by passing on from generation to generation what we’ve learned from life.”
Freedman’s organization, Encore.org, has played a key role over the past decade in promoting and developing the idea of encore careers - second acts for older adults focused on social purpose and innovation. Two years ago, Encore.org launched a major new youth-mentoring initiative called Gen2Gen, aimed at recruiting and mobilizing more than a million older adults to help young people thrive. 
The campaign is working with government and nonprofit groups in seven cities around the country to expand opportunities for older adults to work with children and help them thrive. The focus typically is on issues such as childhood poverty, tutoring and mentoring. So far, the campaign has attracted 160 partner organizations, 1,100 grassroots leaders and a community of 71,000 supporters, Encore reports.
In his book, Freedman explores the intellectual underpinnings of the Gen2Gen campaign. And he gets specific about ways to do it. 
“Older people need to get proximate to the young, finding ways to build contact with the younger generation into their daily lives,” he told me. “Start with housing - look for neighborhoods that have a mix of generations. Some older people I know have even sought out co-housing arrangements, because they knew it was a prime opportunity to connect across the generations.”
BUILDING BONDS
He also advises older people to think of common interests that bond generations together. ""That’s the most reliable crucible for building bonds."" For example, he writes about a senior living facility in Cleveland that has an artist-in-residence program that provides free housing for graduate music students. “The older residents and young musicians frequently share a love of music, which provides the basis for deeper bonds,” he said. ""Other people I know have become youth baseball coaches, school volunteers and chess mentors.”
But Freedman’s focus on older people as a resource also flips upside down the narrative about older people as a drain on society, and a looming intergenerational war. This is a recurring motif in U.S. media and public opinion - the notion that baby boomers are engaged in generational theft, spending down the nation’s resources on programs like Social Security and Medicare, leaving young people with a huge pile of debt and a bleak future. 
Plenty of holes can be poked in the deficit and debt arguments, as I noted last week. (https://reut.rs/2SNhvnU) Their proponents also falsely portray this spending in zero-sum terms - as though security in old age for your parents makes no difference in your own life.
But Freedman prefers a ""glass half-full"" approach. “I don’t want to be a Pollyanna about the challenges of the massive demographic shift that is coming - any change of this magnitude will require adjustment,” he said. “But I see these changes primarily as an opportunity to be seized, not a problem to be solved.”

1488,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2018 12:51PM ET</span>",Center-right set to remain top in EU parliament: poll analysis,"By Daphne Psaledakis
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European People's Party will remain the biggest group in the European Parliament come elections in May, giving the center-right EPP's lead candidate Manfred Weber a shot at succeeding Jean-Claude Juncker as EU chief executive, according to a Reuters analysis of polls.
Weber, who leads the EPP in the EU legislature, easily won a party congress ballot to be its ""Spitzenkandidat"", or official nominee to be president of the European Commission -- although many EU member state leaders say they will not be bound by May's election results in choosing Juncker's successor.
The analysis is based on polls in the 27 EU states or actual election results where these are more recent. Where available, the polls used are those collected by the European Parliament in its monitoring of national political trends, which can be found here: http://www.europarl.europa.eu/at-your-service/en/be-heard/eurobarometer/political-landscape-developments .
The analysis indicates that the EPP would remain the biggest party, extending its lead over the center-left Socialists and Democrats (S&D), whose Spitzenkandidat is Juncker's Dutch deputy Frans Timmermans. But reflecting recent national trends, the two mainstream groups would together drop below half the seats as anti-EU nationalists and a range of other small parties do well.
Most countries use simple proportional representation in EU elections, so calculating seats from votes is straightforward. Regional voting in Italy, Ireland and Belgium entails making some assumptions to project seats from voting percentages.
The polls make varying claims of accuracy and the analysis provides only a rough snapshot of sentiment; it is a method used by some EU officials internally - including at the EU assembly itself - to get a sense of the shape of the next parliament.
According to the Reuters analysis, the EPP stands to gain about 177 of the total 705 seats, down from 219 in the current 751-seat chamber. The parliament is shrinking next year because Britain is leaving the EU in March.
The S&D would still be second with 141 seats, down from 189. An informal ""grand coalition"" with the EPP would be short of a majority, however, suggesting the new Commission head will have to build broader support to steer legislation through.
The Greens, doing well in Germany, are set to hold steady in the EU legislature. Latest polls show them winning 23 of Germany's 96 seats, or 48 seats in total, down from 52 today.
The liberals of ALDE, assuming an eventual alignment with President Emmanuel Macron's new centrist En Marche party in France, would become the third largest party with 83 seats, overtaking the ECR group, which will lose out from the departure of its founders from Britain's ruling Conservative party.
The far-right EFDD and ENF groups, aided by the popularity of the now ruling League and 5-Star in Italy, stand to gain 20 seats, to a total of 98, despite the departure of Brexit campaigners the UK Independence Party. Though the future line-up in the parliament of anti-immigration parties including France's National Rally and the Dutch Freedom Party is unclear, the broad far-right bloc could grow to 14 percent from 10 percent.

That could challenge the established parties and crack open internal divisions after Britain leaves the bloc next March.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Prosecutors said on Thursday they have decided not to bring criminal charges against former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who resigned in May after four women accused him of physical abuse.
The decision was announced by Nassau County District Attorney Madeline Singas, who was appointed by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to investigate the allegations shortly after Schneiderman’s sudden May 7 resignation.
Singas said she personally interviewed Schneiderman’s accusers and found them credible, but that state law made it impossible to bring criminal charges.
“I believe the women who shared their experiences with our investigation team. However legal impediments, including statutes of limitations, preclude criminal prosecution,” Singas said in a statement.
In a statement on Thursday, Schneiderman apologized ""for any and all pain that I have caused,"" and said that after spending time in a ""rehab facility"" he was committed to ""making amends"" to those people he harmed.
""I recognize that District Attorney Singas' decision not to prosecute does not mean I have done nothing wrong,"" he said. ""I accept full responsibility for my conduct in my relationships with my accusers, and for the impact it had on them.""
Cuomo's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Schneiderman, 63, resigned hours after allegations by his accusers, who said they were romantically involved with him, were published in The New Yorker magazine.
The women claimed that Schneiderman subjected them to nonconsensual physical violence, sometimes during sex, including being slapped or choked. https:// Schneiderman, a Democrat, resigned after more than seven years in office. He had become a persistent critic of the Trump administration and a leader in the #MeToo movement. He was replaced as attorney general by Barbara Underwood, who did not seek a full term. Letitia James, New York City’s public advocate, was elected attorney general on Tuesday. Singas separately proposed a new law that she said would protect victims of sexually motivated violence. 
She asked state lawmakers to make it a Class A misdemeanor to commit sexual harassment, defined as the slapping, striking, kicking or shoving of someone without consent for the purpose of ""sexual arousal or gratification.""

""Yemen is the largest hunger crisis in the world. Millions of people are living on the edge of famine and the situation is getting worse by the day,"" said the U.N. agency, which is already providing food assistance to 7-8 million Yemenis.
""WFP food and other humanitarian support has been instrumental in helping to prevent famine, but the indications are that even greater efforts will be needed to avert mass starvation.""
Food security experts including U.N. and Yemeni government officials conducted an assessment in Yemen last month and are expected to issue their report this month, declaring whether or not parts of the country are in famine. 
The last report in March 2017 stopped short of declaring famine but said 6.8 million people were in an ""emergency"". The new report could put the number at 12 million-14 million, the WFP statement said. 
""This would mean nearly half the population having so little to eat that they are just one step away from starvation.""
The hunger crisis is man-made, caused by Yemen's civil war, economic collapse and problems getting shipments into the country, which traditionally relies on imports for well over half its food.
Most of the aid would be food supplies but some would be given in cash-based transfers, WFP said. 
The U.N. children's agency UNICEF says a child dies every 10 minutes in Yemen from diseases that could easily be prevented, and half of Yemeni children are chronically malnourished. 
According to the World Health Organization, acute malnutrition affects 1.8 million children under five, and about a third of Yemen's districts are at risk of sliding into famine.

MAUBEUGE, France (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday he had always condemned Marshal Philippe Petain, who collaborated with Nazi Germany in sending thousands of Jews to their death, but reiterated praise for his World War One military record.
Macron angered Jewish groups and some political opponents on Wednesday by saying it was ""legitimate"" to honor Petain alongside France's other seven wartime marshals at commemorations to mark the end of the Great War this week.
Petain was feted as a war hero after taking command of the French armies in mid-1917, following his victory at Verdun, a battle that killed more than 300,000 French and Germans.
But his reputation was shredded when he established the collaborationist Vichy government of unoccupied France that deported more than 70,000 Jews to Nazi death camps.
As criticism mounted on Wednesday, Macron's aides said that only the five marshals buried at the Invalides monument in Paris would receive an official tribute. On Thursday, the president said there had never been plans to honor Petain personally.
""We are celebrating the centenary of a nation's conflict ... and it is normal that our army remembers its soldiers, and in particular its marshals,"" Macron told reporters in Maubeuge, near the Franco-Belgian border.
""I strongly condemned the Petain of 1940 and did so without ambiguity. I also said yesterday that Marshal Petain was one of the great soldiers of 1914-18, and you cannot scratch that from history.""
Francois Hollande, Macron's predecessor as president, said: ""History does not isolate a single period, even a military career bestowed with glory.""
The body that represents France's 400,000-strong Jewish community, Crif, called the idea of paying tribute to Petain ""shocking"". Jean-Luc Melenchon, head of the leftist France Insoumise (France Unbowed) party, called Petain ""a traitor and an anti-Semite"" whose ""crimes and his betrayal cannot be erased from history.""
After World War Two, Petain was sentenced to death for treason, though then-President General Charles de Gaulle, a longtime admirer of Petain's military feats, reduced the punishment to life in prison, where he died aged 95 in 1951.

Macron is spending the week visiting battlefields in northern and eastern France to honor the dead of the Great War, when 1.4 million French soldiers perished, an opportunity for a leader criticized as out of touch to reconnect with citizens.

The freighter had set sail from the Iranian Gulf port of Bandar Abbas and stopped off in Hamburg, Germany and Valencia, Spain before reaching the Italian port of Genoa on Oct. 17, where police discovered the heroin stashed away in a consignment of Bentonite clay.
A police spokesman said investigators were not sure when or where the drugs were brought onto the ship.
Police allowed a small portion of the illicit cargo to continue its planned journey by truck to the Netherlands. 
They tracked the vehicle as it crossed Switzerland, France and Belgium before reaching the Dutch town of Roosendal.
When the vehicle pulled into a warehouse on Nov. 2, Italian and Dutch police raided the premises and arrested two men of Turkish origin. The truck driver apparently did not know heroin was in his rig, police said.

""The investigation continues in order to trace the entire network that manages the drug trade, which shows, once again, that the port of Genoa is an important crossroads for drug shipments destined for the rest of Europe,"" a statement said.

LONDON, (Reuters) - Scientists in Britain expressed concern on Thursday after at least 17 delegates from Africa and Asia wanting to attend a health conference in London were denied visas.
Peter Piot, a Belgian-born microbiologist who was part of a team that discovered the Ebola virus in the 1970s and is now director of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, was among those protesting against restrictive criteria for granting short-term business visas.
In a letter to the interior minister, Sajid Javid, Piot said the restrictions ""represent a significant threat"" to the United Kingdom establishing itself as a global health and science hub when it should be showing it is ""open for business"".
The 17 African and Asian delegates had wanted to attend a two-day Women Leaders in Global Health conference, exploring gender balance in global public health.
""This conference is a forum to promote international debate and to nurture new talent,"" Piot said in the letter, a copy of which was posted on his institution's website.
""The denial of these visas not only excludes experts and emerging experts from low- and middle-income countries from participating in these global dialogues around health and health equity but it also precludes the UK from benefiting from this important knowledge exchange.""
The conference has attracted around 900 people from 70 or more countries. Among delegates due to attend are Britain's chief medical officer Sally Davies and Soumya Swaminathan, a World Health Organization deputy director general.
""All UK visa applications are considered on their individual merits and in line with UK immigration rules and guidance,"" an interior ministry spokesman said in a statement. ""The onus is on the applicant to demonstrate that they satisfy the immigration rules.""
He said the ministry would respond to Piot once it had received his letter.
Piot said the restrictive visa rules ""can only deter organizations from holding future conferences in the UK"". He said his own school, a world-renowned scientific and global health institution, ""is considering moving the locations of many of our large international meetings to outside of the UK so that valued global experts can participate more easily.""
Other leading scientists echoed Piot's concerns.
""If we want to continue producing the best science, producing discoveries that will improve all our lives, we need to make it easier, not harder, for researchers to travel and collaborate across borders,"" said Beth Thompson, head of UK and European Union policy at the Wellcome Trust health charity.

Research conducted by the Wellcome and published in September found that a third of African and Asian researchers seeking visas for short term visits to Britain had encountered problems.

1496,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>",Supreme Court Justice Ginsburg fractures three ribs in fall,"By Andrew Chung
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a prominent liberal who at 85 is the oldest U.S. Supreme Court justice, was hospitalized on Thursday after falling in her office at the court the night before, fracturing three ribs, a court spokeswoman said.
Ginsburg initially went home after the fall, but experienced discomfort overnight and went to George Washington University Hospital on Thursday morning, court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said in a statement.
Tests showed she fractured three ribs on her left side and she was admitted for observation and treatment, Arberg added. The court is not scheduled to hear its next arguments in cases until Nov. 26.
Ginsburg, who has served on the court since 1993, is one of the court’s four liberals. The court’s 5-4 conservative majority was restored last month when the U.S. Senate confirmed Republican President Donald Trump’s appointee Brett Kavanaugh after a contentious nomination process in which Kavanaugh denied a sexual assault allegation dating to the 1980s.
If Ginsburg were unable to continue serving on the court, Trump would likely move swiftly to replace her with a conservative, further shifting the court to the right. That would have major consequences for issues including abortion, the death penalty, voting rights, gay rights, business litigation and presidential powers.
As the oldest justice, Ginsburg is closely watched for any signs of deteriorating health. She has survived bouts with cancer and undergoes regular medical checkups. This week's incident was not the first time Ginsburg has suffered an injury as a result of a fall - in June 2012, she fell at home and cracked two ribs.
Kavanaugh’s nomination hearings were rocked by university professor Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations that he sexually assaulted her in 1982, when they were both high school students.
Ginsburg, who made her name as an advocate for women’s rights, voiced support for the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct even as Kavanaugh was about to face a Senate hearing on the allegations against him, saying that unlike in her youth, “women nowadays are not silent about bad behavior.”
Trump went to the court on Thursday for a formal ceremony welcoming Kavanaugh to the nation's highest court. Kavanaugh was sworn in to the lifetime job last month. 
The president sat along with first lady Melania Trump at the front of the marble-walled courtroom near the justices' mahogany bench, and made no public remarks. Some leading Republicans from the U.S. Congress, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, attended.
CRITICAL COMMENTS
Ginsburg made critical comments about Trump when he was running for president in 2016, in an unusual foray into politics by a Supreme Court justice. She later said she regretted making the remarks, saying “judges should avoid commenting on a candidate for public office.”
Ginsburg is a hero among many U.S. liberals, sometimes called ""The Notorious R.B.G"" in a nickname based on the late American rapper The Notorious B.I.G. 
Ginsburg has helped buttress equality rights during her time on the high court, including in sex discrimination cases, and has been a champion of abortion rights and gay rights. In 2010, after the retirement of more senior liberals, she became the court's voice of liberalism on behalf of women, racial minorities and the poor and disenfranchised.
Trump has already named two members of the court, adding conservative federal appeals court judges Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, who was confirmed by the Senate last year.
If he were able to make a third nomination to the court to replace Ginsburg, that would increase the conservative majority to 6-3. The court’s other liberal justices are Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor. Breyer, 80, is the court’s second-oldest justice.
Kavanaugh's Senate confirmation process convulsed the nation just weeks before Tuesday’s congressional elections in which Trump’s fellow Republicans lost control of the U.S. House of Representatives but built on their majority in Senate, which has sole authority over judicial and Supreme Court nominations.
On Wednesday, Trump credited the fight over confirming Kavanaugh, in which Democrats strongly opposed the nominee, for the gains in the Senate.
""By expanding the Senate majority, the voters have also clearly rebuked the Senate Democrats for their handling of the Kavanaugh hearings,"" he told reporters.

Trump selected Kavanaugh in July to replace long-serving conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy, who retired. Other candidates he considered for the vacancy included: Thomas Hardiman, who serves on the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals; Raymond Kethledge and Amul Thapar of the Cincinnati, Ohio-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals; and Amy Coney Barrett of the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May steps up attempts to court European support for a Brexit deal on Thursday as negotiations on securing a smooth British divorce from the world's biggest trading bloc enter their final stages.
She will meet three other EU leaders in Brussels at a NATO dinner on Thursday and have lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday.
EU officials and diplomats tried to play down speculation on an imminent deal after an Austrian newspaper report that a deal could be reached ""in the coming days"" sent the pound higher.
""Parts of the withdrawal agreement still require further negotiation, in particular the issue of avoiding a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland,"" an EU document said on Thursday before the bloc's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier debriefs national ministers on Monday.
Some diplomats said they felt more optimistic than earlier in the week about seeing a deal completed this month. But one senior EU official told Reuters: ""A deal is certainly not done. There's a bit of progress on the backstop but we've no idea if it will fly in London. Both sides are still talking, which is good, but we haven't been told that a deal is imminent.""
Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney, whose country insists on a ""backstop"" clause to avoid disruption on its land border with the British province of Northern Ireland, said ""not by a long shot"" should an imminent breakthrough be taken for granted.
Even a deal among May and her fractious ministers would not necessarily mean the EU would fall in line, he said.
For their part, British officials also suggested agreement was drawing nearer but not quite imminent. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said to get a deal within seven days was ""probably pushing it"" and a government source said May would probably not gather her cabinet until next week.
Nonetheless, with both sides believing a deal must be done in the coming weeks to ensure a smooth withdrawal in March, talks have become intense. May's interior minister Sajid Javid said: ""Clearly we're in the closing stages ... The next few days, the next couple of weeks, they will be very important.""
Speculation of an imminent deal, after months of deadlock over trade arrangements to keep the Irish border open, mounted as May's office announced she would meet several European leaders over a NATO dinner in Brussels on Thursday.
Few officials had been aware in advance, though May had been expected in the Belgian town of Mons on Friday morning for an event marking the centenary of the end of World War One.
The dinner, hosted by the U.S.-led military alliance's Norwegian secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg and including only the Dutch, Belgian and Romanian leaders, is not in itself a forum to talk Brexit.
But being in Brussels could provide a chance to drop in on figures such as Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and EU summit chairman Donald Tusk who most summon EU leaders to endorse any deal.
After the commemoration in Mons on Friday, May is due to meet President Emmanuel Macron in France for further events.
The EU wants to see a breakthrough within a week if leaders are to endorse any deal in November, official and diplomatic sources told Reuters. An EU summit tentatively scheduled for Nov. 17-18 is no longer on the cards.
After May discussed Brexit with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and EU summit chair Tusk this week, British ministers were shown the text of a deal which is 95 percent agreed.
DEAL OR NO DEAL?
The pound has been see-sawing on differing perceptions of whether a deal will be done. May told her cabinet on Tuesday that more time was needed to clear the final hurdle standing between her and a deal: the plan to ensure no hard border emerges on the island of Ireland.
A British government source said a special cabinet sitting of May's top ministers to discuss Brexit was unlikely before next week.
Some of May's senior ministers, such as Brexiteer Michael Gove, want to see the verdict of British government lawyers on how a post-Brexit plan for Northern Ireland's border might work. A Northern Irish political party, the DUP, which props up May's minority government, wants the advice to be published in full. 
May wants a deal on a withdrawal agreement and a framework for future ties before year-end as she must get it approved by parliament. The EU holds a regular summit on Dec. 13-14.
If May fails to clinch a deal or parliament votes it down, then Britain would face leaving without a transition period.
Many business chiefs and investors fear such a ""no-deal"" Brexit would weaken the West, panic markets and block trade. 

A group of British business chiefs called on Thursday for a new referendum on whether to leave the European Union on the terms May hopes to negotiate, or to stay.

Britain has said it found no evidence that Russia interfered in the 2016 Brexit vote and Moscow has repeatedly denied even trying, though opponents of Brexit have repeatedly questioned whether the Kremlin played a role. 
In the referendum, 17.4 million voters, or 51.9 percent, backed leaving the EU while 16.1 million, or 48.1 percent, backed staying. Britain is due to leave on March 29. 
The posters in London showed a picture of Kremlin chief Putin winking and holding the Russian flag beside the slogan: ""Lets celebrate a Red, White and Blue Brexit."" The ""r"" of Brexit was reversed to give it the look of a Cyrillic letter.
In a statement, the people claiming to be behind the campaign said they were a group of Russian military intelligence (GRU) officers who wanted their true role in the Brexit vote to be recognized.
""The group hopes to counter recent unwarranted negative publicity about the GRU by putting up advertisements highlighting their part in Britain's imminent liberation from the EU,"" said the group, which calls itself Proud Bear.
Britain accuses the GRU of trying to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter with a nerve agent in the English city of Salisbury in March.
A video posted by the @Pr0ud_Bear group showed Putin riding a bulldog with the face of Brexit campaigner Arron Banks.
""People of tiny island - it is time to celebrate,"" the video said.
It asked for funding to celebrate the GRU's role in Brexit by hiring a digital billboard at Waterloo station and extolled the economic possibilities of post-Brexit trade with Russia including a booming trade in vodka.
When contacted by Reuters, a representative of the group said in a statement in Russian that it was concerned by the health of Russian democracy and opposed the authoritarian tendencies of Moscow.

The group expressed solidarity with Russian journalists but the representative declined to say who was behind the stunt. The Russian embassy did not immediately comment.

THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (Reuters) - A U.S. Marine Corps veteran opened fire on a crowd of mostly college students and young adults dancing at a crowded country and western bar in a suburb of Los Angeles late on Wednesday, killing 12 people including a sheriff's deputy.
Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean named the suspect, who was also killed, as Ian Long, aged 28. Dean told a news conference Long had likely shot himself.
He said he appeared to have shot at random, using only a Glock .45-caliber handgun. There was no known motive. 
An unknown number of people were wounded in the shooting at the Borderline Bar and Grill, a popular venue with college students and young adults in the suburb of Thousand Oaks. Wednesday was dubbed “College Country Night”.
Dean said there were six off-duty law enforcement officers from various agencies in the bar when the shootings occurred, and some survivors said the law enforcement officers stood in front of them to protect them.
""It's a horrific scene in there,"" Dean said earlier. ""There is blood everywhere and the suspect is part of that.”
It was the third mass shooting in the United States in under two weeks, six days after the death of two women at a yoga class in Tallahassee, Florida and 12 days after a gunman killed 11 worshippers at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, shouting ""All Jews must die"".
""INNOCENT LIVES""
Jerry Nadler, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said lawmakers would get to work on legislation including universal background checks when the House of Representatives convenes in January with a Democratic majority.
""We must find a way to stop the senseless, and many times preventable killings that are robbing our country of innocent lives,"" he tweeted.
President Donald Trump, who has resisted a surge in calls for tougher gun controls since 17 students were shot dead at Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida earlier this year, said on Twitter that he had been ""fully briefed on the terrible shooting in California.""
""Great bravery shown by police,"" Trump tweeted. ""God bless all of the victims and families of the victims."" 
Thousand Oaks was named the third-safest city in the United States for 2018 by the website Niche.
""I’ve learned it doesn’t matter what community you’re in,"" Dean told reporters when asked if he was surprised this happened in Thousand Oaks. ""It doesn’t matter how safe your community is. It can happen anywhere.""
Deputies were at the suspect’s house seeking a search warrant. The gun used in the attack was a Glock handgun, which is designed to hold up to 10 rounds and one in the chamber.
“This weapon did have extended magazines on it,” Dean said. “We do not know at this time how many rounds were actually in the weapon or how many rounds the magazine could actually hold because it’s still being processed as part of the evidence.”
Tristan Appleby, a witness who was at the bar, told CNN that the shooter was dressed all in black, and that the security guard at the front of the bar was shot early on in the assault. Appleby said he saw the suspect fire off about a dozen shots, including at those already wounded and lying on the floor.
California Lutheran University, a private liberal arts school, is less than 5 miles away from the bar where the shooting attack took place and it is a popular venue with many students attending the university. 
School officials said in a statement on its website that classes on Thursday were canceled and the university community was invited to gather at the chapel.
Multiple students from Pepperdine University, a private school in Malibu about 20 miles away south from the bar, were also at the venue and the school said on Twitter that it was working to identify and provide support to those students.
BLACK MASK
The dead officer was identified as Sergeant Ron Helus, a 29-year veteran of the department, Dean told reporters. Helus and a California Highway Patrol officer were the first to arrive at the bar and went inside just before 11:30 p.m. PST (0730 GMT).
In a statement the sheriff’s office said there would be a procession in honor of Helus, who leaves behind a wife and son, on Thursday at 10 a.m. “Ron’s selfless, heroic actions will never be forgotten,” the statement read.
Witness Taylor Von Molt, 21, who said she was a promotor at the bar, said the gunman wore a black mask with a bandana covering the bottom of his face, and a black hoodie.
""I heard what I thought was a balloon pop,"" she told CNN. 
""I was confused because we didn’t have any balloons. I saw him, then I saw him fire his weapon one more time. I ran to the nearest exit and tripped and fell on the way and people kept running on top of me.""
Von Molt said she and others from California Lutheran University often gathered there to line dance to country music. 
Witness John Hedge told ABC News he was near the front door of the California bar when the shooting began. 
""I just started hearing these big pops. Pop pop pop,"" he said. ""There was probably three or four. I hit the ground. I look up. The security guard ... was shot, he was down. The gunman was throwing smoke grenades all over the place. I saw him point to the back at the cash register and he just kept firing.""
Dean estimated that 10 to 15 people, including one with a gunshot wound, had gone to area hospitals. He said he thought their injuries were minor, and that most of them were likely injured as they escaped, some by breaking windows.

None of the civilian victims were identified. Helus died while being treated at an area hospital several hours after he was shot, Dean said.

The exodus, driven by violence, hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicines, amounts to around one in 12 of the population. 
It has accelerated in the past six months, said William Spindler of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which appealed for greater international efforts to ease the strain on the country's neighbors.
U.N. data in September showed 2.6 million had fled.
""The main increases continue to be reported in Colombia and Peru,"" Spindler said.
Colombia is sheltering 1 million Venezuelans. Some 3,000 more arrive each day, and the Bogota government says 4 million could be living there by 2021, costing it nearly $9 billion.
Oil-rich Venezuela has sunk into crisis under Socialist President Nicolas Maduro, who has damaged the economy through state interventions while clamping down on political opponents. 
He has dismissed the migration figures as ""fake news"" meant to justify foreign intervention in Venezuela's affairs.
The International Organization for Migration (IOM) and UNHCR said the exodus was straining several neighboring countries, notably Colombia.
""Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have largely maintained a commendable open-door policy,"" said Eduardo Stein, UNHCR-IOM Joint Special Representative for Refugees and Migrants from Venezuela. 
""...However, their reception capacity is severely strained, requiring a more robust and immediate response from the international community."" 

Regional government officials are to meet in Quito, Ecuador from Nov 22-23 to coordinate humanitarian efforts.

Six months after a parliamentary election, the row has further delayed the formation of a national unity government that is expected to group most of Lebanon's sectarian political parties.
Lebanon is in dire need of a government able to implement the economic reforms that the IMF says are needed to put its public debt on a sustainable path. Lebanon has the world's third largest public debt as a proportion of the economy, and growth is stagnant.
A deal looked close last week when the Christian Lebanese Forces Party ceded ground to President Michel Aoun and his Free Patriotic Movement, settling a row over Christian representation that had been seen as the main obstacle.
But Hezbollah, a heavily armed group backed by Iran, is pressing for one of its allied Sunni members of parliament to be given a cabinet portfolio, reflecting their gains in the election. Hariri, Lebanon's leading Sunni, has resisted.
""We believe that the key to the solution is in the hands of the prime minister designate,"" said Hezbollah deputy leader Sheikh Naim Qassem.
""He is the one who can accomplish the government tomorrow, and he is the one who can postpone the government to another time,"" he said in comments broadcast by al-Manar TV.

Though an ally of Hezbollah, Aoun has sided with Hariri in the row. Last week, Aoun said he wanted a strong prime minister and not to weaken Hariri. He also criticized the Sunni MPs allied to Hezbollah, saying they did not constitute a parliamentary bloc that could demand cabinet representation.

DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh's Chief Election Commissioner said on Thursday that the South Asian nation would hold a general election on Dec. 23, and vowed that the Election Commission would ensure a free and fair election. 
K.M. Nurul Huda, the head of the Election Commission, said he hoped all parties will participate in the election, in which Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is seeking to get re-elected. 
""A favorable situation prevails in the country to hold a free and fair election,"" Huda said during a nationwide address aired by state-run television and radio stations, adding almost all preparations for an election were already complete. 
While Hasina's government has won widespread global plaudits for letting in hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees who fled persecution in Myanmar, its critics have decried Hasina's increasingly authoritarian rule, the government's handling of student protests this year and its crackdown on free speech. 
Huda said there would be 40,000 voting centers across the nation, and more than 600,000 law enforcement personnel would be deployed to ensure a free and fair election. 
Bangladesh's ruling Awami League party on Wednesday rejected an opposition party's demand for a caretaker government ahead of the election. The opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) says that a caretaker government is essential for free and fair polls, but the ruling party says the demand is unconstitutional. 
""I urge political parties to participate in the election to make it meaningful,"" said Huda, adding that if parties have any differences of opinion they should resolve these via talks, but not boycott the elections. 
It is still not immediately clear whether the BNP plans to contest the elections. BNP boycotted the last election in 2014 that was marred by deadly violence and shunned by international observers as flawed.
Following Huda's announcement, BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir told Reuters that his party and its allies were still deliberating whether to participate. He said the BNP had asked the commission to defer the vote, but that its wishes had not been met.
""There is no reflection of public wishes and expectations in the schedule and it is moving toward a unilateral election,"" he said. 
The BNP, which is in disarray following the jailing of its chief, former prime minister Khaleda Zia, on corruption charges, had also pressed for a caretaker government at the 2014 election and boycotted it after the demand was not met.
Hasina and Khaleda, who between them have ruled Bangladesh for decades, are bitter rivals and the BNP says its leader has been jailed on trumped-up charges to keep her out of politics.

Separately, certain civil society groups and activists have also criticized the country's new Digital Security Act, and a new Broadcast law that is under consideration, warning these regulations would erode free speech in the country ahead of the election.

HASSI MESSAOUD, Algeria (Reuters) - After persuading oil majors to help explore Algeria's vast shale gas reserves, state energy firm Sonatrach has started reaching out to a different kind of partner: mystical Sufi preachers.
Sonatrach CEO Abdelmoumen Ould Kaddour and his colleagues have been courting Sunni Muslim Sufi masters from communities in areas near prospective southern gas fields to win over locals worried about possible disruption from exploration work.
The state company brings Sufi preachers to meetings in the country's southern region, where most of Algeria's energy reserves lie and which is also home to more traditional communities, to explain prospects for jobs and other benefits.
""Sonatrach has to show it cares about people. We appreciate that it invites us to attend its gatherings and conferences in the south,"" Sufi master Bayziz Ibrahim said at a Sonatrach meeting at Ouargla, near Algeria's biggest oilfield Hassi Messaoud.
Sonatrach has been increasingly turning to foreign firms, which have long been reluctant to invest in Algeria because of red tape and tough terms, to push up oil and gas output.
But it needs to ensure that international companies which sign up do not face protests from local communities, like the demonstrations that forced Sonatrach temporarily to halt shale exploration tests near the southern In Salah gasfield in 2015.
Sufi leaders can influence these often remote communities from their zawiyas, which are houses where people gather to listen to sermons, recite the Koran and conduct rhythmic rituals that aim to bring practitioners of Sufism closer to God.
""We will tell the people and the youth that Sonatrach's efforts are to be welcome,"" Ibrahim told Reuters on the sidelines of the gathering attended by people from the area, members of the local authorities and Sonatrach employees.
Ibrahim ended the meeting by leading prayers.
""You need to respect people, you need to talk to people, and the best way is to go through their spiritual leaders,"" said Osmani, a local at the gathering who only gave his first name.
Villagers in the south of Algeria often grumble that too much of the nation's energy wealth heads to the north and the capital Algiers, so Sonatrach has promised to build new public facilities, such as a cultural center, hospital and stadium.
Sonatrach executives also point to the thousands of jobs it had provided in the energy industry and related work to youths in the south during the past 15 months.
More opportunities may be on the way. In October, Sonatrach reached a deal with Britain's  BP  (LON:BP) and Norway's Equinor to develop Algeria's shale gas reserves, estimated to be the world's third largest.
It is seeking a similar agreement with U.S. firm  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM).

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - From getting rid of some Muslim names of places to promising a ""grand"" statue of the Hindu god Ram, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party is making passionate appeals to its hard-core Hindu nationalist base in the most politically important state ahead of a national election next year.
A near clean-sweep in Uttar Pradesh, the northern state of 220 million people that sends the highest number of lawmakers to the lower house of parliament, helped Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) win its biggest mandate in three decades in 2014.
Political strategists say keeping its mainly Hindu base intact in Uttar Pradesh and elsewhere would be crucial to repeat such a performance, but there are also concerns that the BJP has been turning up the heat on divisive religious issues.
Yogi Adityanath, a robe-wearing Hindu priest who is the BJP chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, on Tuesday changed the name of Faizabad district to Ayodhya, the place where Hindus believe Lord Ram was born thousands of years ago. Before the change, Ayodhya was the name of a town in Faizabad.
Last month, he changed the name of Allahabad, where three rivers considered holy by Hindus meet, to the Hindu name Prayagraj.
Both Faizabad and Allahabad were Islamic names given to places hundreds of years ago by India's then Muslim rulers. 
""Ayodhya is our honor, prestige and pride,"" Adityanath said at an event in the town, declaring the name change amid loud cheers from the audience. ""Ayodhya is identified with Lord Ram.""
He said the state would decide on a location for a statue of Ram that could become an Ayodhya landmark. He also promised to open an airport in the district that would be named after Ram.
Many leaders of the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the Hindu-first group from which the BJP was born, are demanding the government issue an executive order that would bypass the Supreme Court so that they can build a Ram temple at a highly controversial religious site in Ayodhya. The destruction of a mosque on that site by a frenzied Hindu mob in 1992 sparked deadly riots across the country.
At the moment the site is under court control. There are fears that communal tensions between the majority Hindu population and Muslims, the biggest minority group in India with more than 170 million people, could flare again if the status quo is disturbed.
The moves aren't limited to Uttar Pradesh. In the western state of Gujarat, the BJP government there is also considering changing the name of the state's commercial center, Ahmedabad, a name given to it by a former Muslim ruler. 

And only last week, Gujarat unveiled the world's tallest statue, a $400 million effigy of independence hero Vallabhbhai Patel that is nearly twice the height of New York's Statue of Liberty as part of a BJP campaign to re-brand what it terms ""forgotten"" leaders.

Husnu Mahalli, a prominent journalist who also writes columns in the opposition newspaper Sozcu, will not be sent to jail due to time already served and as the ruling is up for appeal.
The Turkish court also handed Mahalli a suspended sentence of one year and eight months for insulting public officials.
Mahalli will only serve the lesser sentence if he commits a crime that requires a prison sentence in the next five years, during which he will be on probation.
""My client has been sentenced due to the expressions he used in his columns, tweets. These should be regarded within the freedom of criticism. We will appeal the sentence,"" Mahalli's lawyer Ertugrul Aydogan said.
Mahalli was detained in December 2016 after he accused Turkey of assisting terrorist groups in Syria and called Erdogan a dictator. He was released in January in 2017 pending trial.
Mahalli defended himself in court, saying he was doing his journalistic duty, private Demiroren news agency (DHA) reported.
""I have not insulted the president. I have always addressed him as Mr. President. The word 'dictator' is not an insulting word. I demand my acquittal,"" he said during his defense, DHA said.
Turkish authorities have detained tens of thousands of civil servants, journalists, soldiers and others following a failed military coup in July 2016. They have also shut down about 130 media outlets.
Erdogan has said some journalists helped nurture terrorists through their writing, and says the crackdown is needed to ensure stability in Turkey, a NATO member that borders Syria, Iraq and Iran.

Critics say Erdogan is using the post-coup crackdown to muzzle dissent and tighten his grip on power, charges he denies. The European Union, which Turkey aspires to join, has also criticized the crackdown.

Netanyahu was questioned by police in the investigation but, in a statement announcing its conclusion, police reiterated that the prime minister is not a suspect.
The deal for three submarines and four patrol vessels has been the subject of a corruption investigation since 2016 after Israel's Channel 10 TV reported that David Shimron, Netanyahu's personal lawyer and a distant relative, also represented the local agent of Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems, raising concerns of a conflict of interest.
""I did not commit any crime,"" Shimron told Israel's YNet news website, which asked him about the police recommendations to prosecutors and posted an audio clip of his comments.
Shimron's office and a spokesman both declined immediate comment when contacted by Reuters. The spokesman said a statement would be issued later.
""Our information comes so far only from the press, we do not yet have any confirmed information,"" a spokesman for Thyssenkrupp said in a statement. ""As soon as we know all the facts, we will examine further measures within the framework of legal possibilities.""
The other suspects facing possible indictment include retired senior naval officers and former government officials.

Netanyahu has been named as a suspect in three other corruption investigations. In February, police recommended charging him with bribery in the first two. Israel's attorney-general is weighing whether to indict him.

Itay Zalait put up the statue in Tel Aviv's Habima Square (NYSE:SQ). It show the minister, Miri Regev, wearing a flowing white dress and facing a large mirror.
On Monday, parliament gave preliminary approval to legislation that would enable Regev's ministry to reduce or cancel state grants to institutions whose works ""contravene the principles of the state"". No date for a final vote has been set.
Zalait said now was the time for artists ""to come out of the museums"" and bring their works directly to the public.
""This is our fight and we can never know ... if (we) could do it in a couple years from now,"" he said, alluding to what artists and rival politicians have described as Regev's attempts to curb freedom of expression.
Her proposed law targets artistic endeavors which the culture ministry judges as denying Israel's existence as a Jewish and democratic state, supporting incitement to ""violence or terrorism"" or desecrating the Israeli flag or national symbols.
Referring on Twitter to the looking glass that Zalait placed in front of her statue, Regev said it was the artistic community that was in need of self-reflection.
""For the past three years, I have indeed dealt many times in holding a mirror up to the Israeli cultural world,"" she wrote.
Regev drew international attention last week, in her dual role as sports minister, when she attended an international judo tournament in Abu Dhabi and visited its grand mosque, a rare display of Israel's diplomatic push in the Gulf.
Two years ago, Zalait drew condemnation from Regev when he placed a gilded statue of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, dubbed ""King Bibi"" by the sculptor, in another Tel Aviv square.

It was soon toppled by a man in the crowd, apparently angered by criticism of Netanyahu, now in his fourth term as Israel's leader.

TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi said on Thursday he was ready to swear in ten new ministers named in a reshuffle that he had originally rejected, easing a high-level political standoff that has alarmed donors.
Prime Minister Youssef Chahed announced the reshuffle on Monday - but Essebsi quickly rejected it, saying he had not been consulted.
On Thursday, he relented and told reporters he would swear in the ministers if parliament approved the changes. ""I have no problem with the prime minister but I dislike the handling of his reshuffle,"" he said.
The dispute highlighted tensions at the highest levels of Tunisian politics that have been exacerbated by an economic crisis.
Chahed leads a government dominated by the ruling Nidaa Tounes party and backed by moderate Islamists.
But the prime minister has been caught up in a dispute with the leader of the party, Hafedh Caid Essebsi, who is also the president's son and has accused Chahed of failing to tackle high inflation, unemployment and other problems.
The political wrangling has alarmed donors which have kept the country afloat with loans granted in exchange for a promise of reforms such as cutting a bloated public service. 
Tunisia's economy has been in crisis since the North African state kicked off the Muslim World's ""Arab Spring"" uprisings by toppling autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali in 2011.
Chahed's reshuffle announced on Monday is the 10th major cabinet overhaul since then. He said it would ""make the work of government more effective and to put an end to the political and economic crisis"".
Chahed kept the leadership of finance, foreign and the interior ministries unchanged.
He named Jewish businessman Rene Trabelsi as minister of tourism in the Muslim Arab country, just the third member of the small minority to enter the cabinet since Tunisia's independence in 1956.

A former foreign minister under Ben Ali, Kamel Morjan, was named minister in charge of the public service, the country's main employer.

Thousands of migrants, mostly Hondurans fleeing poverty and violence, have been traveling in a caravan towards the United States in recent weeks. On Oct. 19, some of them rushed through Guatemalan border gates onto a long bridge connecting to Mexico. But the surge was halted by Mexican federal police.
Reuters photographer Ueslei Marcelino was on the bridge and captured the picture of the man with the child.
""The migrants had already broken through the first police barricade on the Guatemalan side of the bridge. After a while, they moved towards the second barricade on the Mexican side,"" said Marcelino.
""Suddenly women and children formed a line and started to walk towards the police. There was a bit of pushing and shoving, and then things started to get increasingly chaotic.""
Eventually, Mexican police pushed the migrants back to the Guatemalan side.
Many of the migrants spent that night on the bridge, while hundreds of others eventually chose to jump into the Suchiate River below in a bid to reach Mexican soil. Within a few days, as many as 10,000 migrants had entered Mexico, caravan members said.
When Reuters photographer Leah Mills saw migrants jumping into the river from the Guatemalan side, she waded in and captured an image of an exhausted-looking man carrying a child.
""To me this shows how desperate these people are. They are willing to cross rivers with strong currents, to lose any belongings they had, to struggle through the water with their children.""
Reuters photographer Adrees Latif saw a human cordon being formed in the river by migrant men, locking arms to make sure no-one was swept away. 
""A family that had made it to the middle of the river was handing their children to other men to help them reach the shore,"" he said.
As a man grabbed the girl in front of him and took her to safety, Latif followed.
""This photograph begs the question: why would a family leave home and not only risk their own lives but also the lives of their children by doing such extraordinary things? What propels someone to walk without knowing where they will next break bread or quench their thirst?""

KROKOS, Greece (Reuters) - Every autumn, Zisis Kyrou is more often found plucking flowers in northern Greece's purple saffron fields than in his office as a civil engineer.
Saffron - the spice so expensive it's called ""red gold"" - has brought jobs and money to a region better known for coal mines and unemployment. A year ago, its producers began exporting to the United States. Now they're looking to China.
Most are young Greeks who were shut out of the job market during Greece's nine-year economic downturn. They returned to the countryside to make a living off the land. 
""It was hard to find work in your field during the crisis, particularly in civil engineering, because there was no construction,"" said Kyrou, 34, as he harvested with pollen-stained hands.
In 2012, he returned to Greece from London with two university degrees. He eventually opened an engineering office in his village of Krokos, but most of his income comes from his four acres of land, which he hopes to increase.
""I didn't imagine I'd return,"" he said. ""But it was a decision I don't regret."" 
Greeks have been cultivating saffron for three centuries in the countryside surrounding Krokos, which takes its name from Crocus, the saffron flower. Alexander the Great is said to have used it to heal battle wounds.
But until 2000, production was limited to 30 kg a year for domestic consumption, said Nikos Patsiouras, who heads Greece's Cooperative of Saffron.
That changed in 2008, when the crisis hit. Greece now produces about four tonnes a year, 70 percent of which goes abroad. The Cooperative has doubled its members from 494 to 1,000. It also has increased its land from 592 acres in 2008 to 1,349 acres.
""A lot of young people found work in the fields - scientists,"" Patsiouras said. ""I believe more will join.""
Signs of the crisis are visible across Krokos, where shuttered shops line the streets. Unemployment in northwestern Greece is 23.5 percent, three points higher than the national average. But the fields are abuzz.
""We have God on our side, who gave us such a unique product,"" Patsiouras said. ""We hold on to it like the apple of our eye.""
Saffron grows only in this region of Greece. Marketed as Krokos Kozanis, one gram costs about four euros in Greek shops.
It takes 150,000 flowers to make a kilo of the spice, which sells for about 1,500 euros. Flowers are handpicked, and at the cooperative women in blue overall weigh and package it. They are forbidden to wear make-up and perfume, to protect its flavour. 
Iran is by far the world's biggest saffron producer, but demand for the Greek variety is rising, Patsiouras said. Greece is in talks with China for exports in 2019.
In the Patsiouras household, three generations have gathered after a day of harvesting to remove the saffron strands from the flowers and dry them. 

""If we don't transfer this tradition to the next generation, we will fail,"" said his daughter-in-law, Maria Patsioura.

The Houthis raided the May 22 hospital in the city's eastern suburbs, sources said, as clashes raged on in the face of mounting calls from world powers, including some of Saudi Arabia's main Western allies, for a ceasefire.
""This is a stomach-churning development that could have devastating consequences for the hospital’s medical workers and dozens of civilian patients, including many children,"" said Amnesty's International's Middle East Director of Campaigns, Samah Hadid. 
Fighting was getting closer to the hospital and had already disrupted services there, the International Committee of the Red Cross added.
Houthi officials did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
A Saudi-led coalition has been battling to push Iran-allied Houthis out of the city they have held since 2014. A surge of fighting in the past week has trapped thousands of civilians in the crossfire and coalition air raids.
U.N. bodies and other powers have warned that an all-out attack on the city, an entry point for 80 percent of Yemen’s food imports and aid relief, could trigger a famine in the impoverished state.
The latest fighting has focused on Hodeidah's eastern 7th July neighborhoods and around a university just 4 km (2.5 miles) from the port and a few blocks from al-Thawra hospital, the main medical facility on Yemen's western coast.
NEW DEFENSE MINISTER
Saudi Arabia is leading a Western-backed alliance of Sunni Muslim Arab states to try to restore Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and his internationally recognized government that was ousted from the capital Sanaa by the Houthis in 2015.
As fighting mounted overnight, Hadi appointed a new defense minister - Mohammed al-Maqdishi - and named Abdullah Al-Nakhi as Chief of Staff, state news agency SABA reported.
Maqdishi had been chief of staff and the facto defense minister for more than a year, and the official title would give him more authority to oversee the fighting, a senior Yemeni government official told Reuters.
Yemen's ousted government has fled further south down the coast in Aden, but Hadi and other cabinet members are based in Riyadh.
The Houthis say they are defending their homeland from foreign invaders and accuse the Yemeni government of decades of marginalization.
The United Nations has no up-to-date estimate of the death toll in Yemen. It said in August 2016 that according to medical centers at least 10,000 people had been killed. 
Pressure has mounted on Saudi Arabia since the killing of Journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month, to end the 3-1/2 year war that has already created one of the world's worse humanitarian crises.
Amnesty added it has documented a series of air strikes carried out by the Saudi Arabia and UAE-led Coalition in the lead-up to the recent escalation in fighting, including two that killed 11 and 21 civilians last month.

One boat attempted to set sail from the southern coast of Bangladesh on Wednesday, the coast guard said, while several vessels left Rakhine state in western Myanmar, according to Rohingya leaders, aid workers and a monitoring group.

More than 700,000 Rohingya, members of a persecuted Muslim minority, fled Rakhine following an army-led crackdown in August last year, settling in sprawling Bangladeshi refugee camps, according to U.N. agency figures, while hundreds of thousands remain inside the country in internal displacement camps and villages.
Refugees say soldiers and local Buddhists carried out mass killings and rape during the violence last year, while the United Nations has accused the military of “genocidal intent”. Myanmar has denied almost all the allegations.
‘TRAPPED’
For years, Rohingya on both sides of the border have boarded boats organized by smugglers in the dry months between November and March, when the sea is calm. The perilous journey to Thailand and Malaysia, often undertaken in overcrowded, rickety vessels, has cost many lives. 
Thailand cracked down on the trade after discovering a series of mass graves in 2015, leading to a crisis when smugglers abandoned their human cargo and left boats adrift in the Andaman Sea.
The new departures come as Myanmar prepares to take some of the refugees back after agreeing with Bangladesh to start repatriation on Nov. 15, despite widespread opposition from Rohingya, who say they will not return without guarantees of basic rights, including citizenship and freedom of movement.
The United Nations has said conditions in Rakhine, where Buddhists have protested against the repatriation, are not conducive for returns and the special envoy on human rights, Yanghee Lee, on Thursday urged a halt to the “rushed plans”.
Chris Lewa, director of the Arakan Project, which has a network of sources across Rohingya communities, said the threat of being sent back to Myanmar could be pushing refugees to turn to smugglers.
“The Rohingya are trapped,” she said when contacted by Reuters via phone. “They have nowhere to go. No one wants them, and now they face on top of that the threat of repatriation.”
On the other side of the border in Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine, tens of thousands of Rohingya have been languishing in internal displacement camps since a previous wave of violence in 2012.
Accounts of how many boats had left Myanmar differed. A high level of secrecy surrounds the smuggling operations.
An aid worker in Sittwe said they had received information that at least four boats had departed since the start of October, and some of them had already arrived in Malaysia. Some of those boarding the boats were women and children joining other family members, the aid worker said.
“The living conditions in the camp are very bad and there’s not enough food to survive,” said Kyaw Hla, a Rohingya leader from Thae Chaung camp outside Sittwe, where he said one boat carrying some 80 people left last week.
“People are not able to stand against all these troubles, so they are deciding to leave,” he said. ""There’s no hope for us here.”

Tanzanian Immigration Department spokesman Ali Mtanda said Angela Quintal and Muthoki Mumo were arrested for violating the terms of their visas by holding meetings with local journalists. ""They were supposed to get a separate permit for that,"" he said.
President John Magufuli's government has been criticized by opposition politicians and international rights groups for what they say is growing authoritarianism and intolerance of dissent. The government rejects the criticism.
Quintal, a South African citizen, and Mumo, a Kenyan, were detained in their Dar es Salaam hotel room by immigration officers and taken to an unknown location in the country's commercial capital, according to the CPJ.
The two were freed on Thursday into the hands of South Africa's diplomatic mission. ""They are safe and relieved that they are now with the High Commissioner of South Africa...Thami Mseleku,"" South Africa's foreign ministry said in a statement.
Mtanda said Quintal and Mumo were free to stay on in Tanzania as long as they heeded the terms of their 90-day visa. 
Quintal works as the CPJ's Africa program coordinator while Mumo is the group's sub-Saharan Africa representative.

The European Union said this week it would review its relations with Tanzania after an official in Dar es Salaam threatened to launch a crackdown on homosexuals.

""We have found an agreement,"" Riccardo Molinari, a senior figure in the far-right League party, told reporters after a meeting of key government figures.
Thousands of legal cases collapse every year in Italy because magistrates are often unable to secure a definitive conviction before the statute of limitations kicks in.
The ruling 5-Star Movement, which has made battling corruption a priority, wants to remove many of the time constraints as quickly as possible. 
Its coalition partner, the League, says any changes should form part of a more ambitious judicial reform, which will take months to devise, warning that easing the statute of limitations means defendants could face unacceptably long legal battles.
Under the terms of Thursday's accord, the change to the statute will be approved by parliament this year but will only come into force in 2020 when a broad legal reform is enacted, Deputy Prime Minister and League leader Matteo Salvini said.
Luigi Di Maio, the head of the 5-Star who also serves as deputy prime minister, welcomed the deal having earlier warned in a newspaper interview that the government risked collapsing over the issue.

""(There will be) short trials with clear timeframes. Things are finally, really changing,"" Di Maio said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).

GAZA (Reuters) - A seasonal shift in the weather and intensified international diplomacy are prompting Palestinians mounting protests along Gaza's border with Israel to rethink their tactics.
Since the demonstrations started more than seven months ago, protesters routinely made attempts to breach Israel's frontier fence and launched incendiary balloons and kites that have burned forests and crops inside Israel.
Israeli forces have killed more than 219 Palestinians at the border protests, according to Gazan officials. An Israeli soldier was also killed by a Palestinian sniper. 
The protests draw tens of thousands of people after Muslim prayers on Fridays. But last week was the quietest so far, according to journalists who regularly cover the demonstrations.
Smoke from burning tires wafting toward Israel provided a measure of cover for Palestinian youngsters approaching the barrier, but a wintry change in wind direction sent the thick black clouds back into Gaza and Israeli tear gas deeper into the crowd of protesters, forcing their retreat. 
Stepped-up efforts by Egypt to craft a long-term ceasefire between Gaza's ruling Hamas group and Israel that could ease an Israeli blockade are also putting a damper on the protests.
A ceasefire, said one official familiar with the talks involving Egypt, Qatar and the U.N., would include a gradual end to the rallies, or an agreement to hold them far from the fence, as well as an easing of Israeli restrictions on the movement of goods and people at the border.
Organizers have made clear the protests would continue until the long-standing Israeli border restrictions were lifted. Dubbed the ""Great March of Return"", the campaign demands the rights to lands Palestinian families fled or were driven from during fighting around Israel's founding in 1948.
One protester, wearing a black mask, said demonstrators were weighing new ways to confront the Israeli military now that seasonal rains have begun.
""We may use fire crackers, noisy horns and we will try to cut through the fence. We will surprise them with things we will not make public now,"" said the 23-year-old, who gave his name only as Hakim.
One idea, he said, was to build a giant slingshot to launch rocks across the barbed wire barrier.
A statement by a Palestinian group which claimed balloon launchings said it would allow time for diplomacy to work before escalating action again. 
""We will give a chance for an agreement to be reached that will ease the bitterness of the blockade imposed on our people,"" said the Sons of Zwary group, named after a Hamas engineer killed in Tunisia in an alleged Israeli assassination.
In the meantime, it said, it was preparing hundreds of incendiary devices.
Daoud Shehab, of the National Committee supervising the protests, said five assembly areas were being prepared for winter.

""We are placing plastic sheeting to cover large areas and we are also going to pave the ground where people usually gather,"" he said.

GHAZNI, Afghanistan (Reuters) - The Taliban have infiltrated a strategic district in southeastern Afghanistan and fought with members of the Shi'ite Hazara minority, officials said on Thursday, a week after militants and a Shi'ite militia clashed in a central province.
Insurgents raided the Jaghori district in Ghazni province on Wednesday, aiming to regain control of a Shi'ite-dominated region that allows women to move freely and encourages higher female participation in government.
The attacks on Jaghori by the Taliban, a militant group made up mainly of ethnic Pashtun Sunni Muslims, have heightened fears of a new surge of sectarian violence in Afghanistan.
The violence has also highlighted concerns that Hazaras, members of a mainly Shi'ite minority, may take up arms in frustration at a lack action by the central government.
Abdul Qayum Sajjadi, a lawmaker in Ghazni province, said President Ashraf Ghani's Western-backed government was negligent.
""I repeatedly urged the central government to send backup forces to Jaghori, but security departments were slow in sending reinforcements. The residents are forced to fight the battle,"" he said on Thursday.
A senior interior ministry official said at least six policemen were killed and dozens of civilians and militia members were wounded in clashes with the Taliban that began on Wednesday.
Presidential spokesman Shah Hussain Murtazavi said that helicopters had been deployed to Jaghori to fight the militants.
""Jaghori will become the burial site of the Taliban,"" he wrote on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
Government officials said Jaghori appeared to be part of a Taliban network used for evacuating their injured fighters from central provinces, as well as tax and extortion activities across provinces. 
The fighting marks the end of a deal made between Jaghori's village elders and the Taliban made a decade ago.
Under the agreement, the Taliban allowed girls to attend schools and colleges, and women to drive vehicles in the district.
In return, the local militias did not oppose the limited Taliban control in the district.
The Taliban said on Thursday the attacks would continue in Jaghori and other parts of the country controlled by the government.
""These attacks are not against any ethnicity or any group or religion,"" Zabiullah Mujahideen, a Taliban spokesman, said in a statement.
""Our countrymen in Jaghori, especially our countrymen from Hazara ethnicity and Shia, have to be careful about the conspiracy of a few corrupt puppets of the U.S. sitting in Kabul,"" he said.

SINGAPORE/YANGON (Reuters) - The customary cordiality of Southeast Asian summits may be missing when the region's leaders meet next week due to sharp differences over Myanmar, whose military has been accused of genocide against the country's Rohingya Muslim minority.
Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi is due to attend the Nov. 11-15 Singapore meeting, and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, a doyen of the group, has served notice he has lost faith in the Nobel peace laureate because of the Rohingya issue.
""We have made it quite clear we don't really support her any more,"" Mahathir said in an interview with Turkish news channel TRT World just over a month ago. 
""Our policy in ASEAN is non-interference in the internal affairs of the countries, but this is ... grossly unjust,"" he said, referring to the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations. 
The Rohingya crisis is one of the biggest man-made disasters involving a member since ASEAN was founded in 1967, and it is one of the thorniest issues yet faced by a group that traditionally works by consensus.
Many diplomats and rights activists say ASEAN's credibility is at risk if it fails to tackle the matter head-on.
A U.N. report in August detailed mass killings and gang rapes with genocidal intent in a military crackdown that began in 2017 and drove hundreds of thousands of Rohingya from Myanmar's Rakhine state into neighboring Bangladesh. 
Outrage over what the United Nations branded ""ethnic cleansing"" has brought demands from Western nations for criminal charges and sanctions.
""ASEAN credibility and its international standing would be severely tarnished if ASEAN remains indifferent to the Rakhine crisis,"" said Kavi Chongkittavorn, a former special assistant to the ASEAN secretary-general and a veteran Thai journalist who has worked in Myanmar.
The Rohingya issue comes at an important juncture for a region pushing for more economic integration in response to rising protectionism and a trade dispute between the United States and China. 
ASEAN's Muslim-majority members - Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei - tend to take the toughest line on the Rohingya question, while Myanmar has close regional allies in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. Under military control in recent years, Thailand has also provided cover for Myanmar.
In remarks delivered alongside Suu Kyi at a forum in Hanoi in September, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said countries outside Indochina were too critical of politics in the region and questioned whether they understood Myanmar.
""UNCOMFORTABLE SCRUTINY"" 
Richard Horsey, a former U.N. diplomat in Myanmar and a political analyst based in Yangon, said leaders from outside the region who will attend the meetings in Singapore will be asking difficult questions about Myanmar. 
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe are among those expected to join ASEAN leaders in meetings later in the week. 
""Beyond this uncomfortable scrutiny, and possible distraction from other ASEAN priorities, some ASEAN elders also worry about the risk of the group polarizing along religious lines,"" Horsey said. 
Singapore will deliver the chairman's remarks next week so its role in the tone that ASEAN strikes will be pivotal.
A source close to pre-summit discussions, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Singapore is leaning toward a stronger stance because it is the most internationally engaged member of ASEAN and feels responsibility as host to protect its credibility.
Asked for comment, Singapore's Foreign Ministry said ASEAN leaders are expected to discuss the situation in Rakhine state when they meet next week and, as chair, Singapore supported discussions on the matter.
""However, ultimately, it is the responsibility of the Myanmar government and the relevant stakeholders to reach a comprehensive, viable and durable political solution to this situation,"" a spokeswoman said in an email response to Reuters.
Earlier this year, Singapore Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan said the group had urged Myanmar to give a full mandate to a commission of inquiry to hold accountable those responsible for the crisis in Rakhine state. 
That was a toughening of rhetoric that had previously focused on repatriation of displaced persons to Myanmar and reconciliation among communities.
""The shift in language, especially the recent calls for more accountability, reflect to a certain extent that ASEAN views the Myanmar issue as an indicator of its own 'accountability' in dealing with a recalcitrant member,"" said Moe Thuzar, a lead researcher at Singapore's Institute of Southeast Asian Studies who specializes in ASEAN and Myanmar issues.
A government source in Thailand, which takes over as chair of ASEAN next year, also said the group's credibility was at stake, especially after the U.N. report on the Rohingya crisis. A third source close to the discussions said the issue ""is a problem and we know it is a problem."" 
Myo Nyunt, spokesman for Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy, said Myanmar would explain the situation at the summit.
""We accept there are different views, but we have to make decisions for further plans based on the real situation of our country. I want them to understand that there are some parts we cannot handle,"" he said.
Suu Kyi has previously said her civilian government should not bear all responsibility for the crisis because the military retains a powerful political role under the constitution.

1525,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2018 04:30AM ET</span>",Britain's Prince Charles says: I won't meddle when I am king,"By Alistair Smout
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Prince Charles said he will stop speaking out on issues he feels strongly about when he becomes king as he is ""not that stupid"".
Speaking ahead of his 70th birthday next week, the son of 92 year-old Queen Elizabeth said that the role of monarch was completely different to his current position as Prince of Wales.
""The idea, somehow, that I'm going to go on in exactly the same way, if I have to succeed, is complete nonsense because the two - the two situations - are completely different,"" he told the BBC.
Asked whether his public campaigning will continue, he said: ""No, it won't. I'm not that stupid.""
Britain has a constitutional monarchy, where the monarch has a formal role in the formation of governments but an obligation to remain neutral and no practical political power.
Charles has been outspoken on topics such as the environment and social issues. In September Charles said in an interview with GQ magazine in September that ""My problem is I find there are too many things that need doing or battling on behalf of.""
But he told the BBC that he would operate within ""constitutional parameters"" as king.
""I do realize that it is a separate exercise being sovereign. So of course I understand entirely how that should operate,"" he said.
But he defended his activism as heir to the throne, which includes founding the Prince's Trust charity in 1976 to support vulnerable young people.
He said: ""If it's meddling to worry about the inner cities as I did 40 years ago, then if that's meddling I'm proud of it.""
SAVE THE WORLD
Charles was four when his grandfather George VI died and his mother ascended to the throne at the age of 25. 
In that time, Charles has sometimes courted controversy of the kind that Elizabeth has sought to avoid.
Beside his outspoken views, Charles faced intrigue around the acrimonious end to his marriage to first wife, Princess Diana, and hostility in some quarters to his second wife Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall.
Camilla told the BBC that his drive to get things done spurred his activism.
""He would like to save the world,"" she said
Charles' supporters say his causes - such as helping disadvantaged young people find work, inter-faith dialogue and campaigning against throwaway plastic - are often prescient.
But other views, such as his support for complementary medicine, still attract scorn. 
In 2013, it was revealed he had held 36 meetings with government ministers over three years, while two years later, Britain's top court ruled that dozens of his letters to ministers - dubbed the 'black spider memos' because of his scrawled handwriting - could be released.
Topics included rural housing, food in hospitals and the fate of the Patagonian Toothfish. 
His son, William, said that he would like Charles to spend more time with his grandchildren.

""When he's there, he's brilliant,"" William said. ""We need him there as much as possible.""

1527,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2018 03:59AM ET</span>","After deadly Lion Air crash, new focus on torrid industry growth in Indonesia","By Jamie Freed and Fanny Potkin
JAKARTA (Reuters) - In April 2013, a Lion Air Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 missed the runway on the Indonesian resort island of Bali in bad weather and plowed into the sea, cracking its fuselage open on the rocks.
All 108 on board survived. But a September 2014 report by Indonesia's air crash investigators highlighted errors and poor training, saying the 24-year-old co-pilot had failed to adhere to the ""basic principles of jet aircraft flying.""
Lion Air, struggling to get off a European Union blacklist because of ""unaddressed safety concerns,"" asked Airbus, which supplies part of its fleet, to help improve training.
The EU removed the privately owned budget airline from the list in 2016 after it determined Lion Air met international safety standards. None of Indonesia's roughly 100 airlines - most of them tiny - remain on the EU blacklist, with the last few coming off in June. All were banned in 2007; the national carrier, Garuda Indonesia, was the first to be removed in 2009.
The crash of a Lion Air jet on Oct. 29 into the sea off Jakarta has put a spotlight back on the airline's safety record, although the cause remains undetermined. None of the aircraft's 189 passengers and crew survived.
Lion Air's latest crisis illustrates the challenge relatively new carriers face as they try to keep pace with unstoppable demand for air travel in developing nations while striving for standards that mature markets took decades to reach.
Retired air force chief of staff Chappy Hakim, an adviser to the transport ministry, told Reuters he avoided flying with Lion Air or other Indonesian airlines, with the exception of Garuda, which has not had a fatal crash since 2007.
""I know Garuda,"" he said of the national carrier. ""The other airlines, I don't believe they do the maintenance and training properly.” He declined to elaborate further.
Lion Air Managing Director Daniel Putut disputed any laxity in the airline's safety culture, stressing that it conducted maintenance in accordance with manufacturer guidelines.
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation, the Indonesian aviation authority, did not respond to multiple requests for comment about Lion Air’s safety record.
Putut, a former pilot, also told Reuters during a visit to the airline's training center near the Jakarta airport that it complied with all regulatory requirements.
He said Lion Air had worked hard to install an attitude of ""zero tolerance"" for accidents after the Bali crash, making last week's disaster a painful eye-opener. Thousands of Lion Air flights have taken off and landed without serious incident since then.
""We are also looking into what went wrong - new aircraft, experienced crews, and we have applied the zero-tolerance culture, yet another accident happened,"" Putut said. ""But we still don't know the cause, so we will wait for the investigation from NTSC (National Transportation Safety Committee).""
SAFETY CULTURE
Frank Caron, head of a risk consulting firm who served as Lion Air's safety manager from 2009 to 2011 after insurance companies requested a foreign expert, said that at the time he was troubled by what he regarded as the airline's attitude that accidents were inevitable.
""Safety is much more than running concepts and procedures,"" he said. ""Safety is a spirit, a state of mind, a way of thinking, an attitude in the daily aspects of an operational life. And that is precisely what Lion never got. They would say, 'The airline has 250 flights a day, it is not abnormal that you have accidents.'""
For example, after the 2013 Bali crash, Lion Air co-founder Rusdi Kirana told local media who asked about the airline's safety record: ""If we are seen to have many accidents, it's because of our frequency of flights.""
Caron claimed he left Lion Air after some of his safety recommendations were not implemented. Lion Air's chief executive declined to comment on Caron's account of his departure or his other assertions.
Indonesian accident investigators made four recommendations after the Bali crash, including that Lion Air should ""ensure that all pilots must be competent in hand flying"" and teach proper cockpit coordination.
They also urged the aviation authority to ensure all airlines under its control did the same.
Putut said Lion Air embraced those recommendations. 
Between the Bali crash and the one last week, Lion Air had three non-fatal accidents, including one in April in which a 737 skidded off a runway, according to Flight Safety Foundation's Aviation Safety Network database.
Since it began operating 18 years ago, Lion Air has seen a total of eight planes damaged beyond repair in accidents, two of which killed a combined 214 people, according to the Aviation Safety Network database.
During the same period, five jets from its chief rival, the national carrier Garuda Indonesia (JK:GIAA), were damaged beyond repair, and two accidents killed a combined 22 people, according to the database. Garuda declined to comment about its safety record.
Since the 2013 Bali crash, Lion Air has sought to improve safety by gaining European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification for its pilot training and maintenance facilities.
EASA certifies its training center to instruct other airlines' pilots on A320 simulators and is seeking the same approvals for 737 jets and ATR72 turboprops, said Audy L Punuh, Lion Air's Angkasa Pilot Training Organisation Director.
RAPID GROWTH
Lion Air has expanded quickly since it started flying in 2000, overtaking national carrier Garuda by capturing more than half of the domestic market and establishing offshoots in Thailand and Malaysia.
It has ridden a wave of aviation growth in Indonesia, where air travel has become critical for the economy.
Domestic air traffic more than tripled in Indonesia over the past decade as prosperity and low fares made flying affordable for more people.
With 129 million passengers in 2017, the Southeast Asian country was already the world's 10th-largest aviation market and is projected to continue growing.
That growth has been accompanied by an air-accident rate that was twice the global average in 2017 and consistently higher than Indonesia’s neighbors in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, according to the United Nations' aviation agency.
Indonesian pilots are allowed to fly a maximum of 110 hours a month, which is more than the 100 hours in most other countries.
Last year seven commercial planes were damaged beyond repair around the world, according to Boeing data; two were in Indonesia, wrecked in non-fatal accidents involving Sriwijaya Air and Tri M.G. Airlines.
LATEST CRASH
Flight JT610 took off from Jakarta at 6:20 a.m. on Oct. 29, bound for Bangka island, off Sumatra, and plunged into the sea 13 minutes later. Just before the crash, the pilot asked to return to the airport.
The aircraft flew erratically on its previous flight and its airspeed readings were unreliable, according to an accident investigator and a flight tracking website.
Investigators on Monday said the flight data recorder from the downed jet showed an airspeed indicator had been damaged during its final four flights, raising questions about maintenance and mechanical problems.
Boeing said on Wednesday it had issued a bulletin to airlines reminding pilots about what it described as existing procedures for handling erroneous data from sensors.
The Federal Aviation Administration later issued a directive calling for revisions to ""operating procedures of the airplane flight manual."" 
It is too early for regulators to decide whether to reconsider the decision to remove Lion Air from the EU blacklist, EU Ambassador to Indonesia Vincent Guerend told Reuters. 
""The European Commission continues to monitor the situation on a regular basis,"" he said. ""It is still too early to have any conclusive views on the causes of the accident.""

Local authorities confirmed there had been a riot at the prison, but provided no other information. Khujand lies around 300 km (186 miles) north of the Tajik capital, Dushanbe. 
According to an interior ministry official not authorized to comment publicly, the riot started when one inmate regarded by the authorities as a member of the Islamic State militant group attacked a prison guard. 
The prison called in security forces to help quash the riot, which had now ended, said a security official speaking on the condition of anonymity. 
Tajikistan, an impoverished Central Asian country, routinely reports detentions and convictions of Islamist militants. Last July, Islamic State claimed responsibility for an attack which killed four Western tourists in Tajikistan.

Morrison's conservative government was reduced to a minority in parliament after voters in a wealthy Sydney constituency voted for an independent candidate in a by-election to replace former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, who quit politics after he was ousted by his own party.
Morrison, who must call an election by May 2019, had to seek support from independents to prevent a no confidence vote that would trigger an early election.
On Thursday, the prime minister said he had struck a deal with Bob Katter, an independent MP from Queensland. 
""The agreement will support the continued stability of the government, and us getting on with the job,"" Morrison said in an emailed statement. 
The government promised A$234 million in federal funding for irrigation and dam projects in Queensland, where parts of the state have been hit by a devastating drought. 
Reuters was not able to reach Katter for comment.
The agreement increases the chances of Morrison serving out his term in office.
Lagging behind the opposition Labour party in opinion polls, Morrison had moved to satisfy the demands of several independents by quietly evacuating child refugees from one of Australia's remote Pacific detention centers.

Under Australia's tough border control policy, asylum seekers arriving by boat are detained in two Pacific detention centers until they are accepted by another country or agree to return home.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union wants Britain to stick to the bloc's rules on state aid, environment and workers' rights after Brexit to prevent it from gaining unfair access to the Europeans' single market, diplomatic sources and officials told Reuters.
The EU sees this as key to ensuring a ""level playing field"" should the so-called Irish border backstop kick in after Brexit, tying all of the United Kingdom in a customs zone with the bloc. 
""It is important that Britain would not undercut our own products on our own market in the all-UK Irish backstop,"" one source said of the EU demand that comes as the two sides are seeking a Brexit deal as soon as this month.
The EU has made concessions on the biggest hurdle in the talks - the Irish border backstop or an emergency fix to ensure the frontier there stays open regardless of how Brexit goes - but there are still differences on the life span of such a solution, a review mechanism or the depth of regulatory alliance under the all-UK backstop, which has been sought by London. 
The EU has presented the three areas as the bare minimum it deems necessary, complemented by no internal trade tariffs or quotas and the same external tariff. 
It does not want to allow Britain to be able to pull out unilaterally but proposes that any such decision could be done by a joint committee. 
The bloc is now waiting on whether British Prime Minister Theresa May can get her cabinet and parliament behind that.
Should that be possible, EU and British Brexit negotiators would recommend that ""decisive progress"" has been achieved in Brexit talks and the EU would call a special summit of its 27 national leaders to endorse it. 
While it is still possible later in November, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar warned on Wednesday that chances for a deal this month were fading.
For Britain, it is important to lock a deal before the turn of the year to give businesses the clarity they need to plan for the first quarter of 2019 when Britain is due to become the first country ever to leave the EU.

Two of Hun Sen's sons are high-ranking members of the military. His youngest son is a member of parliament and chairs a parliamentary commission on youth and sport.
Hun Sen's critics say the appointments are aimed at cementing the 66-year-old's control over government and the economy at a time of political tension after a widely criticized election in July.
""They all have doctorate or master's degrees. Why should they waste them? I should find work for them,"" Hun Sen said, speaking at an academic award ceremony for high school students in the capital, Phnom Penh.
Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party won all 125 parliamentary seats in the election, which the United Nations and some Western countries have said was flawed because of the lack of a credible opposition among other factors.
The opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) was dissolved late last year ahead of the election and several of its leader was detained.
The European Union has began a formal procedure that could result in Cambodia being stripped of its special trade status over human rights concerns, in particular, those arising from the election.
Cambodia has denounced the EU pressure as an ""extreme injustice"".
Two of Hun Sen's sons were appointed to their positions after the vote, amid a government crackdown on critics, civil rights groups and independent media.

Many members of Hun Sen's family are prominent members of Cambodia's business community.

""We need to find (an agreement), otherwise the government contract would collapse,"" Di Maio, who is also leader of the 5-Star, said in an interview with Il Fatto Quotidiano paper, in the latest sign of escalating tensions between the two ruling parties.
He also confirmed that on Thursday he would meet with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, deputy prime minister and League leader Matteo Salvini, and Justice Minister Alfonso Bonafede.
The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement wants to loosen time limits imposed on the prosecution of numerous crimes, including corruption.
The League says easing the statute of limitations means defendants could face unacceptably long legal battles. Five-Star says that as things stand too many cases are rubbed out without a verdict ever being reached.
Other policy differences are also straining the coalition.

On Wednesday, in order to tackle dissent within the 5-Star, the government called a confidence vote in the upper house Senate on a contested security decree championed by Salvini.

1533,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2018 02:14AM ET</span>",Australian political leader resigns after harassment allegations months from election,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - The leader of the opposition in Australia's most populous state resigned on Thursday after he was embroiled in a #MeToo row when a female reporter released a statement detailing alleged inappropriate behavior.
New South Wales (NSW) state Labor party leader Luke Foley denied allegations made by an Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC) journalist but said he was resigning as party leader, four months before a state election he had been in a position to win.
""I can't fight to clear my name and fight an election at the same time, its just not possible to do both. Therefore I am resigning the leadership effective today,"" Foley told reporters in Sydney.
Foley said he had hired lawyers and would launch legal action for defamation. He declined to answer any questions.
Earlier on Thursday, the ABC issued a statement from one of its journalists that detailed alleged misconduct by Foley at a Christmas function in Sydney in 2016, in which she said she was forced to go public because the issue was raised in parliament.
Harassment allegations were first raised by a government minister in parliament on Oct. 18.
The reporter, Ashleigh Raper, said in her statement that she never wanted the issue to go public.
""It is clear to me that a woman who is the subject of such behavior is often the person who suffers once a complaint is made,"" Raper said in her statement.
""I cherished my position as a state political reporter and feared that would be lost. I also feared the negative impact the publicity could have on me personally and on my young family.""
Raper said she issued the statement because she wanted harassment of women to stop, for politicians to stop using such incidents for ""political point scoring"", and to get on with her life.
The ABC, which ran Raper's statement in full, said it had discussed with her the alleged incident earlier this year and had adhered to her request to keep it private.
""The ABC considers it extremely unfortunate that media and public pressure has been applied to Ms Raper during these past months and caused her to speak publicly on an issue she did not wish to pursue or to comment on,"" the ABC said in its statement.
Despite Foley's resignation, the scandal is likely to dent Labor's chance of winning power in Australia's largest state in the March 23 election.
A ReachTel poll in September had Labor and the ruling conservative coalition running neck-and-neck in the state.
""The polls are so tight. Labour can ill-afford this episode less than five months out from the next election,"" Peter Chen, political science professor at the University of Sydney, said before the resignation.
The NSW economy accounts for one-third of Australia's gross domestic product and at $400 billion is larger than the economies of Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines.

Others had to shave their heads or drink water from a toilet bowl and had their salaries withheld by a month, according to images and videos on Chinese social media cited by state media.
The punishments were all publicly meted out in the presence of other staff, state media said, citing workers who had quit the company in the southwestern province of Guizhou. 
Forgetful staff who did not wear leather shoes to work or failed to turn up in formal attire were given 50 yuan ($7.20) fines. 
Their misdemeanors were duly recorded in little, white slips. 
But most staff chose to stay despite the punishments, which started this year, state media said.
Three managers at the company were jailed from five to 10 days on the charge of humiliating others, according to a social media post by the local public security bureau. 
Labour conditions in China have often been described by activists as harsh and unforgiving, with workers having to work excessive hours and live in cramped quarters on meager wages.
At the Guizhou company, many of the punished showed little outward sign of unhappiness, according to state media, choosing instead to accept their fate.

Salvadoran President Salvador Sanchez Ceren is returning from his first trip to China since the countries established diplomatic ties in August. Speaking on local television, Ceren said he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping during the visit and agreed to 13 joint projects, without providing details.
The donation marks China's latest gambit to make inroads in Central America, a campaign that has drawn the ire of the United States. Earlier this year, El Salvador cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favor of China, following the Dominican Republic and Panama. The United States promptly recalled its ambassadors in the region.
""This historic meeting between the governments of the People's Republic of China and the Republic of El Salvador has produced excellent results,"" Ceren said. ""This confirms that the establishment of diplomatic relations with China is my government's most important decision in foreign policy.""
Representatives for the Chinese government were not immediately available for comment. 
The date when the funds will be received has not been set, a spokesman for the Salvadoran government said. 
China will also donate three thousand tons of rice to support Salvadorans who are reeling from a drought in July and floods in October, Ceren said. 
The White House warned in August that China was luring countries with incentives that ""facilitate economic dependence and domination, not partnership."" 

Self-ruled Taiwan has formal relations with a dwindling number of countries, almost all of them small and less developed nations in Central America and the Pacific.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia will offer Pacific countries up to A$3 billion ($2.18 billion) in grants and cheap loans to build infrastructure, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Thursday, as Canberra seeks to counter China's rising influence in the region. Australia and China have been vying for influence in sparsely populated Pacific island countries that control vast swathes of resource-rich oceans. 
China has spent $1.3 billion on concessional loans and gifts since 2011 to become the Pacific's second-largest donor after Australia, stoking concern in the West that several tiny nations could end up overburdened and in debt to Beijing.
""The government I have the privilege to lead, is returning the Pacific to where it should be; front and center,"" Morrison said in a speech announcing the new Pacific initiative.
""This is our patch. This is our part of the world."" Morrison said Australia will create a A$2 billion infrastructure fund that will invest in telecommunications, energy, transport, water projects. 
Australia will also give an additional A$1 billion to its financing arm, which offers loans to private companies unable to secure funds from traditional lenders, to invest in the Pacific.
Morrison said Australia would also expand its diplomatic presence in the Pacific, posting staff to Palau, the Marshall Islands, French Polynesia, Niue and the Cook Islands.
Australia said it will also strengthen defense and security ties with Pacific islands through new joint exercises and training.
While Morrison did not name China in his most detailed foreign policy speech since he become Australia's sixth prime minister in the last decade in August, few were in doubt as to who the policy was aimed at combating. 
""Australia is reacting to what China is doing. Australia needs more tools to engage with the Pacific,"" said Jonathan Pryke, a Pacific Islands foreign policy expert with the Lowy Institute, an Australian think-tank. 
Ties between Australia and China, its largest trading partner, have been strained since Australia accused China of meddling in its domestic affairs late last year.
""This announcement will be a gauge of whether Australia can improve relations with Beijing while doing things that would have previously annoyed China,"" said Nick Bisley, professor of international relations at Melbourne's La Trobe University. Australia's Foreign Minister Marise Payne will on Thursday meet her Chinese counterpart in Beijing, the first visit by an Australian foreign minister in two years after bilateral relations soured. 
Australia has in recent months earmarked the Pacific for infrastructure spending, driven by national security concerns, but it has been forced to raid its aid budget to fund projects.
In May, Australia said it would spend about A$200 million to develop an undersea internet cables to Papua New Guinea (PNG) and the Solomon Islands amid national security concerns about China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL]. 
Earlier this month, Australia said it would help PNG develop a naval base, beating out China as a possible partner for the port development. 

Diplomatic sources told Reuters Australia was worried the port could accommodate military vessels in strategically important waters.

Ahmed Alahmedalabdaloklah, 41, also known as Ahmad Ibrahim Al-Ahmad, was sentenced to life in prison plus 30 years, after a jury found him guilty on March 16 on six terrorism-related charges, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Wednesday.
Alahmedalabdaloklah was arrested under an Interpol warrant in Turkey in 2011, under the name Al-Ahmad, and detained there until his extradition in August 2014 to the United States, officials said.
The initial indictment accused Alahmedalabdaloklah of designing and assembling parts for wireless detonators and circuit boards used in roadside bombs planted for attacks on American forces in Iraq.
According to that indictment, he built the wireless systems in a house in Baghdad with components he procured from 2005 to 2010 from an unspecified company based in Arizona.
""Alahmedalabdaloklah sought to harm American soldiers by conspiring with others to construct and supply improvised explosive device (IED) parts for bombs that were used in Iraq. He will now serve the rest of his life in prison,"" John C. Demers, Assistant U.S. Attorney General for National Security, said in a press release.
His convictions are: conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction, conspiring to maliciously damage or destroy U.S. property by means of an explosive, aiding and abetting other persons to possess a destructive device in furtherance of a crime of violence, and conspiracy to possess a destructive device in furtherance of a crime of violence.

YOKOSUKA (Reuters) - Built to hunt Russian submarines, Canadian frigate HMCS Calgary is instead chasing Japanese and U.S. subs in western Pacific drills as Canada joins other maritime nations in seeking to contain Chinese influence in the Indo Pacific. 
""The expectation is to see one, if not two ships, on a year round basis doing a variety of things with a variety of partners in the region,"" Commander Blair Saltel, the captain of Calgary, said in Yokosuka, Japan. 
His ship, docked at the naval base near Tokyo along with Canadian navy supply ship the Asterix, left Canada in July on a mission that has taken it through the East China Sea, to Australia and into the contested South China Sea, where it encountered curious Chinese warships. 
Last week, it joined Japanese and U.S. warships, including the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier, for anti-submarine warfare exercises in the Western Pacific that were part of the biggest combat readiness war game ever staged in and around Japan.
""There's an opportunity for Canada to demonstrate that we have experience working with allies within coalitions,"" said Saltel. 
Canada's decision to deploy ships to Asian naval exercises comes as other nations, including Britain and France, bolster their presence in a region, fearing China's growing military power could see vital commercial sea lanes come under Beijing's sway. 
London this year has dispatched three warships to the Indo Pacific, including its largest amphibious assault ship, HMS Albion. On its return journey west following a visit to Japan, the 22,000 ton vessel, with a contingent of 120 Royal Marines on board, sailed close to islands claimed by China in the South China Sea.
Beijing, which says its presence on island bases there is peaceful, slammed the operation as a ""provocation"".
Japan, which operates the second largest navy in Asia, this year dispatched the Kaga helicopter on a two-month tour through the South China Sea, and into Indian Ocean, where it sailed with the latest British warship to travel to the region, the Argyll.
Before returning to Canada, the Calgary this month will sail to Sasebo in western Japan, another key base for both the U.S. and Japanese navies, for more anti-submarine warfare drills.

""It's a steady progression toward a mutual agreement to make sure we can share information, share logistics and be able to cooperate at a moment's notice should our navies require,"" Saltel said on the Calgary's bridge as his crew and local Japanese engineers carried out maintenance work.

HELSINKI (Reuters) - A reserved Bavarian and a Finn known for doing Ironman triathlons will vie for the backing of Europe's center-right parties on Thursday in the race to become European Commission president.
German EU lawmaker Manfred Weber and former Finnish prime minister Alexander Stubb will make their pitches at a congress in Helsinki to become the European People's Party (EPP) top candidate for the European Parliament elections next May.
The EPP vote will make the victor the front-runner for the EU's most influential job, the head of the bloc's executive overseeing laws and trade deals.
But with the EPP losing influence in France and Spain, the rise of far-right parties across Europe, and with populists in its ranks in Hungary, Europe's biggest political force faces accusations that it represents out-of-date politics.
""This is not the old Europe that some accuse us of. The EPP is the most credible political group to lead Europe,"" EPP President Joseph Daul told reporters on Wednesday. 
Stubb and Weber ""represent the new generation,"" Daul said. Outgoing Commission President Jean-Claude, an EPP veteran of European politics over three decades, steps down next year.
Fifty-year old Stubb, a prolific Twitter user who cuts a youthful, sporty figure, is the clear underdog against Weber, 46, who leads the EPP group in the European Parliament and has the support of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Almost two-thirds of the EPP members' 734 votes could go to Weber, according to informal projections by party officials, counting Germany's outsized presence in the composition of the group, with more than 80 votes.
""This is a football match between Germany and Finland. I wish it was ice hockey,"" Stubb said, referring to his country's national sport.
""CRAZY CHICKEN""
Stubb could benefit from the secret nature of the ballot amid concerns that Weber's victory would entrench strong German influence in the European Union as Britain leaves the bloc next March, given that several Germans are already in top EU jobs.
The unassuming Weber, who speaks German and English, lacks the experience of Juncker or the charisma of polyglot Stubb, who speaks English, German, French, Swedish and Finnish.
But the strong social and networking skills of Stubb, who described himself as ""running around like a crazy chicken"" on Wednesday, have also got the better of him. He was judged too overwhelming for the modesty of Finnish politics and ditched by his own party in 2016 after a series of missteps.
The decision of who gets the Commission job also depends on the EU's national leaders. 
Centrist French President Emmanuel Macron, who swept aside France's traditional political parties with his 2017 victory, rejects a 2013 European Parliament agreement that the parliamentary election winner should take the Commission job.
Under that deal, designed to bring the European Union closer to voters, whichever group comes top in the European assembly's election in May will have first chance to try to obtain parliamentary backing to be Commission president.
The EPP is expected to remain the largest grouping.
Such a contest is aimed at making the vote more relevant to citizens, who have turned out in ever smaller numbers to vote in European elections since the first were held in 1979.

For the first time, EPP candidates Weber and Stubb held a web-streamed debate on Wednesday evening. ""Europe is divided today. Our job is to keep this continent together, otherwise we have no chance,"" Weber said.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau formally apologized on Wednesday for the country's 1939 refusal to take in a ship carrying more than 900 Jewish refugees, adding that the country would do more to protect Canadian Jews from violence.
The St. Louis left Hamburg in May 1939 in a desperate search for a safe haven from persecution by Nazi Germany. After it was rebuffed by Canada and other nations, it returned to Europe, where historians have estimated that more than 250 of the passengers were murdered in Nazi death camps.
""We apologize to the 907 German Jews aboard the St. Louis, as well as their families,"" Trudeau told the House of Commons. ""We are sorry for the callousness of Canada's response. We are sorry for not apologizing sooner.""
The apology came less than two weeks after a gunman shot dead 11 people, including a Canadian woman, at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. Vigils were held across Canada in the aftermath of the attack.
Jewish Canadians ""are understandably feeling vulnerable"" and there have been calls ""to protect synagogues and other places that are at risk of hate-motivated crimes,"" Trudeau said during his parliamentary address.
""And I pledge to you all now: we will do more,"" he said, noting that around 17 percent of all Canadian hate crimes target Jewish people. 
Shimon Koffler Fogel, head of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, applauded Trudeau's ""historic apology"" and his pledge to expand security measures for Jewish institutions. 
Earlier, Trudeau met with Ana Maria Gordon, the only surviving Canadian passenger from the ship, and her family members, and spoke about the need to fight anti-semitism.
Trudeau, a Liberal, has made a number of apologies for Canada's historic failings. 
Last week the prime minister visited hundreds of indigenous people in British Columbia to say sorry for the hanging of six chiefs 150 years ago.

In May 2016, six months after taking office, he stood in parliament to apologize to the descendents of hundreds of passengers of the Komagata Maru, a Japanese vessel carrying Sikh, Muslim and Hindu migrants who were refused entry into Canada under 1914 immigration laws.

Egypt's navy has in the past shot at Gazans whom it has accused of crossing the maritime border. There was no initial information on whether the fishing boat had crossed into Egyptian waters.
Wednesday's incident took place off the coast after dark near the southern border town of Rafah, said Gaza's interior ministry, which is run by officials loyal to Hamas.
""Egyptian naval vessels fired toward a Palestinian fishing boat near the southern sea border of Gaza Strip which led to the death of Mustafa Abu Odah, 30,"" the ministry statement said.
In Cairo, an Egyptian military source denied the report, without elaborating.
Israel maintains a naval blockade of the Gaza Strip and sets a varying fishing limit, which currently extends to a maximum of nine nautical miles.
Egypt has been trying to craft a long-term ceasefire between Hamas, which rules Gaza, and Israel and is also trying to calm months of protests on the Gaza-Israel border where over 200 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire.
During unrest at the border fence in July, an Israeli soldier was killed by a Palestinian sniper in a cross-border shooting. 
Cairo has also been trying to negotiate a reconciliation agreement between Hamas and the rival Western-backed Palestinian Authority, which holds sway in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's King Salman has embarked on a domestic tour this week with his favorite son, demonstrating his support for his chosen heir despite the crisis spawned by the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Roads were lined with Saudi flags and images of the king and his son Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, when they arrived in the central region of Qassim late on Tuesday. Distinguished figures greeted them and children offered flowers. 
The tour is the latest public outreach by the 82-year-old monarch, apparently intended to shore up the power of Prince Mohammed, known as MbS, who has taken over day-to-day rule but whose international reputation was battered in the month since Khashoggi was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.
State media said the king laid the foundation for new or planned projects worth $1.12 billion and ordered the release of some people from debtors' prison in Qassim, a conservative province in the heart of the Arabian peninsula. 
""There is a lot of tension, fear and apprehension among Saudis in the aftermath of the Khashoggi affair. So it’s a trip that reassures the various regions that the king is still in his place and he’s the highest authority,"" said Madawi al-Rasheed, a London-based Saudi author critical of the Al Saud.
Turkish officials have accused MbS of ordering Khashoggi's murder. U.S. President Donald Trump has suggested ultimate responsibility lies with the crown prince as de facto ruler.
Saudi Arabia, which offered numerous contradictory explanations for Khashoggi's disappearance, now says the U.S.-based Washington Post columnist was killed in a rogue operation. MbS broke weeks of silence on Oct. 25 to vow justice would prevail.
King Salman stepped in to defuse the situation. He sent a trusted aide to Turkey last month, then fired five senior officials, including his son's most trusted adviser.
After weeks of lying low, the prince has now returned to the public stage. He visited troops near the border with Yemen, where Riyadh is involved in a 3-1/2-year war, appearing in an online video on Monday with a soldier he called a hero. In a ceremony at a Riyadh university, he laid the foundation stone for a planned nuclear research reactor.
Greg Gause, a Gulf expert at Texas A&M University, said the domestic tour with his father did not indicate that the royal family is in the clear yet, only that ""the king is confident that nothing is afoot right now.""
CIRCLING THE WAGONS
The 33-year-old crown prince is on course to become the first Saudi monarch from a new generation in 65 years, following a succession of six brothers drawn from among at least 45 sons of state founder Abdulaziz ibn Saud, who died in 1953.
But MbS's rise has upended the system of rule in place for decades, in which successive kings sought family consensus and allocated powerful posts to their brothers and nephews.
MbS consolidated his rule by stripping some of his most powerful cousins from positions of authority and locking some under house arrest. Others were caught up in an anti-corruption crackdown and confined inside a luxury hotel for months.
There have been signs since last week that some princes are being rehabilitated to foster family unity in the wake of the Khashoggi killing. Last week, one of the king's surviving younger brothers, Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, returned from 2-1/2 months abroad where he had appeared to criticize the leadership.
Two of the king's nephews, detained last year, appear to have been released recently, with pictures circulating of them reuniting with family.
Diplomats say the ruling family is ""circling the wagons"". But there is no indication King Salman is considering elevating another prince, either to replace his son or balance his authority by serving as his deputy.
""MbS is not going anywhere. The family is meeting and they will unite stronger behind him,"" said a senior Arab diplomat. ""There is no way back"" after the king cleared MbS's path to the throne by sidelining potential rivals last year.
The king's decision to put MbS in charge of restructuring the intelligence apparatus - a move aimed at addressing a purported cause of the Khashoggi crisis - indicates that the crown prince remains ""untouchable"", the diplomat added.
On Tuesday evening, as King Salman and MbS arrived in Qassim, north of Riyadh, to a stadium of cheering residents, online photos emerged showing Prince Abdulaziz bin Fahd with his brothers and daughters in a residential setting.
The images were the first of the prince, the son of a former king, since his detention, which the government never acknowledged. It was not made clear whether he had reached a settlement with the state like other detainees who were subsequently released, or if his freedom is still restricted.
Over the weekend, another of the king's nephews, a brother of billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, was photographed at his ailing father's bedside after being held for months over online criticism of the anti-corruption purge ordered late last year by MbS. 
The next day Alwaleed, who was among scores of top royals, businessmen and government officials held at Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton Hotel as part of the sweep, went on Fox News to defend MbS in the Khashoggi crisis and the anti-corruption campaign.

""I believe the Saudi crown prince will be 100 percent vindicated and exonerated,” Alwaleed said of his cousin. Alwaleed's own detention was ""forgiven and forgotten,"" he said.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Russia has asked the United Nations Security Council to discuss North Korea sanctions on Thursday, diplomats said, a move that comes after a planned meeting between top U.S. and North Korean officials in New York this week was postponed. 
It was not immediately clear why Russia wanted the council to discuss the issue, though China's foreign ministry said last month that Beijing, Moscow and Pyongyang believed it necessary to consider adjusting the U.N. sanctions at an appropriate time.
The 15-member Security Council has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
China and Russia have said the council should reward Pyongyang for the ""positive developments"" after U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met in June and Kim pledged to work toward denuclearization.
But the United States and other Western powers have said sanctions must be enforced until there is full denuclearization. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has also accused Russia of cheating on U.N. sanctions on North Korea.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had been due to meet senior North Korean official Kim Yong Chol in New York on Thursday to try to pave the way for a second summit between Trump and Kim and make progress on denuclearization.
The State Department announced on Wednesday that the talks would be rescheduled, but gave no reason for the delay. North Korea's U.N. mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the postponement of the talks. 
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations in September that continued sanctions were deepening its mistrust of the United States and there was no way the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
In July, Russia and China delayed a U.S. push for the Security Council's sanctions committee to order a halt to refined petroleum exports to North Korea, asking for more detail on a U.S. accusation that Pyongyang had breached sanctions, diplomats said.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - A leading member of Canada's main opposition party, who was also a former cabinet minister, has resigned from parliament's national security oversight committee after admitting he sent explicit pictures and video to someone he had never met.
Conservative legislator Tony Clement said he shared the material with ""someone who I believed was a consenting female recipient,"" according to a statement he issued late on Tuesday.
""The recipient was, in fact, an individual or party who targeted me for the purpose of financial extortion,"" added Clement, who was the party's spokesman on justice issues.
Clement had high level security clearance as a member of the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians, an oversight body set up in 2017, and had access to highly classified information.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police and government security agencies are investigating, Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer said on Wednesday. 
After initially saying Clement would remain in the Conservative caucus, Scheer later changed his mind and announced he would leave the parliamentary group.
""I took him at his word that this was an isolated incident,"" Scheer told reporters. ""Since then, there have been numerous reports of other incidents, allegations, so in that respect I've asked Tony to resign from caucus so that he can respond to these allegations."" 
Stephanie Carvin, an assistant professor and security expert at Ottawa's Carleton University, said the case was extremely unfortunate for the committee.
""It's the kind of thing security agencies really worry about in terms of blackmail material,"" she said on Twitter.
Clement, 57, is married with three children. He held three ministerial posts in the Conservative government that was in power from 2006-2015 and twice made unsuccessful runs to lead the party.
Clement remains a member of parliament and Scheer would not rule out the possibility of his running again in a federal election due in October 2019. Clement apologized to his family and said he would seek help.

In January, two prominent Canadian politicians stepped down from leadership posts over allegations about their behavior toward women as the #MeToo social media movement spread beyond the United States.

The United States on Monday re-imposed sanctions on Iran’s oil, banking and transport sectors and threatened more action to stop Tehran’s missile and nuclear programs and curb its influence in countries such as Syria, Yemen and Lebanon..
“The enemy is trying to strike a blow against Iran through a soft war and an economic war but they will face a heavy defeat,” Revolutionary Guards Brigadier General Hossein Salami was quoted as saying by the state news agency IRNA.
""Iran has been able to advance in any area that the enemy has placed sanctions on Islamic Iran,” he said. 
Separately, Salami said Lebanon’s Hezbollah had Israel in a “death grip”,
“Today the Zionists are surrounded and are flailing between life and death,” he said.

Iran and Hezbollah are key military supporters of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Israel has staged repeated air raids against Iran's military and allied militia in Syria.

The judge has been investigating for more than a year whether the fertilizer tycoon, who owns soccer club AS Monaco, sought to influence Monaco's law enforcement officials in a long-running dispute with Swiss art dealer Yves Bouvier. 
The Russian alleges Bouvier conned him out of $1 billion by inflating the price of 38 pieces of art he bought over a 10-year period. Rybolovlev is suing his former art adviser in Monaco, Singapore and Switzerland. Bouvier has denied wrongdoing.
""He has been released subject to controls,"" prosecutor Sylvie Petit-Leclair told Reuters. Petit-Leclair said she had not yet been informed by the judge of what charges Rybolovlev would face if the case proceeded to trial.
In a statement, Rybolovlev's Monaco lawyers said he had been released and although his movements were not restrained, he was barred from meeting certain people. ""We particularly insist on the fact that, at this stage, Mr Rybolovlev is presumed innocent,"" they added.
Representatives of Rybolovlev in Russia confirmed he had been released from police custody but declined to make any immediate further comment. 
Under the legal systems in France and Monaco, a suspect is placed under formal investigation if a magistrate believes there is serious or consistent evidence pointing to a crime. He is not formally charged unless he is sent to trial. 
Rybolovlev spent more than $2 billion buying 38 masterpieces from Bouvier between 2003 and 2014.

In 2017, Rybolovlev sold one of those pieces, Leonardo da Vinci's portrait of Christ ""Salvator Mundi"", for $450 million at a Christie's auction, making it the most expensive painting ever sold.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he expects to meet again with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un early next year and that a meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and North Korean officials supposed to have taken place this week would be rescheduled.
Pompeo had been due to hold talks in New York on Thursday with senior North Korean official Kim Yong Chol aimed at paving the way for a second summit between Trump and Kim Jong Un and at making progress on denuclearization.
The State Department said early on Wednesday that the meeting had been postponed, but gave no reason, raising concerns that talks aimed at persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear arms could break down. The State Department said the talks would be rescheduled ""when our respective schedules permit.""
Trump told a White House news conference the change was ""because of trips that are being made,"" but did not elaborate on these.""We are going to make it ... another day,"" he said. ""But we're very happy with how it's going with North Korea. We think it's going fine. We're in no rush.""
Trump said he still expected to hold a second summit with Kim. ""Some time next year, I would say. Sometime early next year,"" he said.
Kim pledged to work toward denuclearization at an unprecedented first meeting with Trump in Singapore but negotiations have made little headway since, with North Korea falling short of U.S. demands for irreversible moves to abandon a weapons program that potentially threatens the United States.
Pyongyang has complained that Washington has not made concessions in return for the moves it has taken and last Friday warned it could resume development of its nuclear program if the United States did not drop its sanctions campaign.
The Trump administration has said that sanctions will not be lifted until North Korea gives up its weapons.
""The sanctions are on. ... I'd love to take the sanctions off, but they (North Korea) have to be responsive, too,"" Trump said on Wednesday.
The State Department said ""conversations continue to take place,"" with North Korea, and added: ""The United States remains focused on fulfilling the commitments agreed to by President Trump and Chairman Kim at the Singapore summit in June.""
South Korea, which has worked to encourage U.S.-North Korea dialogue, sought to play down the talks delay.
Its presidential spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom said Seoul did not believe it would mean that the second summit would not take place and a senior South Korean foreign ministry official said that while the rescheduling was regrettable, there was no need to ""overthink the postponement"".
""I think we have to look at it as a part of the process of reaching complete denuclearization and setting up a peace regime,"" the unnamed official told reporters.
Trump spoke after his Republican Party lost control of the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday after the Democrats rode a wave of dissatisfaction with his presidency in mid-term elections.
Some analysts believe this weakened state could impact Trump's foreign policy and test his North Korean diplomatic gambit. 
While Republicans maintained control of the Senate, the Democrats now have the opportunity to block Trump's agenda and open his administration to intense scrutiny.
Democrats have said they are determined to obtain more information about meetings between Trump and Pompeo and Kim, worried that Trump is so eager to make a ""great deal"" that he will give Kim too much with little in return.

North Korea has for years pursued nuclear and missile programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions but the bellicose rhetoric from both Pyongyang and Trump that raised fears of war has eased this year.

1553,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2018 01:40PM ET</span>",Amnesty says executions of Saudi Shi'ite prisoners imminent,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Amnesty International warned on Wednesday that the executions of 12 Saudi Shi'ite Muslim prisoners could be imminent, after they were sent to a secretive state security body that reports directly to the king.
The men, who were sentenced to death in 2016 after being convicted of spying in a mass trial, have been transferred to the Presidency of State Security, the human rights group said.
They could be executed once the king ratifies their sentences.
""The families of the men are terrified by this development and the lack of information provided to them on the status of the cases of their loved ones,"" said Heba Morayef, Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa director.
""Given the secrecy surrounding Saudi Arabia's judicial proceedings, we fear that this development signals the imminent execution of the 12 men.""
The Saudi government's communications office could not be reached for comment on the cases.
Riyadh's human rights record has been in the spotlight since the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at its Istanbul consulate last month.
A Saudi delegation on Monday heard calls from Western countries at the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva for the kingdom to abolish the death penalty.
According to Amnesty, the men were sentenced to death after being convicted of spying for Iran in an unfair mass trial of 32 people arrested across Saudi Arabia in 2013 and 2014.
Shi'ites have long complained of entrenched discrimination in majority-Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia, a charge the authorities deny, and have periodically staged mass protests in the kingdom's eastern region where many of them live.
In January 2016, the kingdom executed prominent Shi'ite cleric Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, one of the most vocal critics of the Al Saud royal family and a figurehead in the 2011 Arab Spring protests.
An absolute monarchy, Saudi Arabia bans political parties and public forms of protest and has sentenced members of a civil rights organization who campaigned for a constitutional monarchy to decades in prison.
Dozens of intellectuals and clerics have been detained since last year in a crackdown on dissent, including a prominent economist since charged with joining a terrorist organization and meeting with foreign diplomats.
Women's rights activists were arrested in May, just before the lifting of a ban on women driving, and were similarly branded as traitors and ""agents of embassies"" in state-backed media.

1555,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2018 01:01PM ET</span>",EU's biggest grouping puts Hungary's Orban on notice amid rights concerns,"By Robin Emmott
HELSINKI (Reuters) - The European Union's largest political grouping warned Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Wednesday that it might consider expelling his Fidesz party from its ranks due to concern over its record on the rule of law and democratic freedoms.
The center-right European People's Party (EPP) backed a special resolution at its annual congress in the Finnish capital Helsinki demanding respect for the values and freedoms that underpin the EU, saying they faced a serious threat. 
The resolution did not explicitly name Hungary, but officials from the EPP, which includes German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats, said it was meant as a direct message to Orban and his party.
""Populist and nationalist extremism, disinformation, discrimination, and threats to the rule of law pose the greatest threat to freedom and democracy in Europe since the fall of the Iron Curtain,"" the resolution said.
""We stress that the European Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law ... We call on all EPP members and associations to respect, protect and promote these principles,"" it said. 
Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, whose country holds the EU's rotating presidency, said the bloc's values were ""sacred... whatever the party the government leader belongs to and whether that is in Hungary, Romania, Poland, Malta, Greece, Italy"".
Those six nations have all been accused at different times over the past year or so of failing to uphold EU values.
Since winning power in 2010, Orban and Fidesz have stirred concern in Brussels by pressuring Hungary's courts, media and non-governmental groups and also by refusing to take in asylum seekers arriving in Europe.
Though the EU has often protested, it has largely failed to stop what Orban's critics decry as his growing authoritarianism.
A senior Fidesz member of the European Parliament said there was nothing in the resolution that his party could disagree with. ""This is not about Hungary,"" Jozsef Szajer told Reuters. 
However, the resolution included a call for ""academic freedom"", which officials said was a reference to the Orban government's refusal to sign an accord for the Central European University, founded by Hungarian-American billionaire and philanthropist George Soros, to remain in Hungary. 
Orban's government has sought to discredit Soros by accusing him of stoking Europe's migration crisis, a charge Soros denies.
The EPP backed a move by the European Parliament in September to sanction Hungary for flouting EU rules on democracy, civil rights and corruption, and has come under increasing pressure now to expel the party.
EPP President Joseph Daul defended his group's reluctance - so far - to take tougher action.
""In every family, there is an enfant terrible... I prefer to keep my enfant terrible within the family and to speak with him and to be able to reason with him,"" Daul told reporters, though he also confirmed that the resolution targeted Hungary.

Under EPP rules, the group's presidency can consider expelling a party once a request for a vote on the issue has been made by seven members from five different EU countries.

1556,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2018 11:54AM ET</span>","With eye on chancellery, Merkel protégé wants new era in Germany","By Paul Carrel
BERLIN (Reuters) - Pitching to succeed Angela Merkel as Christian Democrat (CDU) leader, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer promised on Wednesday a new chapter for Germany in which ""people feel at home here"" after a period of political turmoil marked by the rise of the far right.
Should she secure the CDU leadership, Kramp-Karrenbauer, 56, would be in pole position to succeed Merkel as chancellor. But she makes her pitch as polls show the chancellor's centrist cause is falling out of favor with German voters.
Kramp-Karrenbauer, who is the conservative party's general secretary, lags businessman Friedrich Merz, 62, in the race, polls show. Merkel said last week she would vacate the CDU leadership at a party congress in December, heralding the end of a 13-year era in which she has dominated European politics.
Kramp-Karrenbauer, seen as Merkel's heir, could probably cohabit as party leader with Merkel as chancellor, which she wants to remain until the end of the parliamentary term in 2021.
But according to a poll for Bild newspaper on Wednesday, two thirds of voters want Merkel to step down. For Kramp-Karrenbauer, the challenge is to define her own profile distinct from Merkel's, while remaining loyal to the chancellor.
""This is the end of the era,"" Kramp-Karrenbauer, whom German media nicknamed ""AKK"" after her initials, told reporters in Berlin. ""We have to thank Angela Merkel for a great deal.""
""My experience is ... that one always stands on the shoulders of one's predecessor,"" she added, stressing the need for political stability in uncertain times.
""We need to work out a way for people here to feel at home - people who have lived here a long time and people who have arrived more recently,"" she added, with reference to the upheaval caused by Germany's migrant crisis in 2015.
She laid out the challenges of delivering prosperity and social cohesion but did not spell out any specific policy prescriptions.
It could prove harder for Merkel to remain chancellor with Merz as CDU leader, as he lost out to her in a power struggle in 2002 and has since pursued a successful business career.
GOVERNMENT EXPERIENCE
Kramp-Karrenbauer's advantage over the other two candidates, Merz and Health Minister Jens Spahn, is that she has won an election - albeit in the small western state of Saarland - and served as state premier there.
She is on the CDU's left on economic policy, being a strong advocate of the minimum wage. Before the 2013 national election she suggested the top rate of tax be raised to 53 percent. 
But she is conservative on social issues, opposing advertising for abortions, and caused controversy in 2015 by saying allowing same-sex marriages could open the door to incest and polygamy.
Vowing ""not to pursue an election campaign against others"", Kramp-Karrenbauer delivered a message of party cohesion and said that if she won the leadership she would seek to work with Merz and Spahn, who lags the other two candidates in polls.
Merz is chairman of the German arm of the U.S. hedge fund BlackRock, whose Munich offices prosecutors searched on Tuesday as part of Germany's largest post-war fraud investigation, a person with knowledge of the matter said. BlackRock says it is fully cooperating with the investigation covering the period of 2007-2011.
Merz took his role at BlackRock only in 2016 and has condemned illicit dividend stripping, but his role at the world's biggest fund manager risks reflecting poorly on him in socially-minded Germany.
In an election, Merz's right-wing pitch could draw back some CDU voters from the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany, which has gained from unease among some voters about the influx of more than 1 million asylum seekers since 2015.

Kramp-Karrenbauer is more likely to be able to form a coalition with the rising force in German politics - the Greens, now the second-strongest party.

CAIRO/DUBAI (Reuters) - Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi spoke daily at the World Youth Forum in the resort of Sharm al-Sheikh this week, touching on topics from Syria's reconstruction to religious tolerance - but it was a remark about potatoes that most stirred the pot. 
""Do you want to build your country and become a worthy state, or are you going to look for potatoes?"" Sisi asked, after hinting that Egyptian civil servants would go without an annual wage increase this year due to increased government costs. 
Sisi was referring to a sharp increase in the price of the staple vegetable over the past two weeks from around 6 Egyptian pounds ($0.3346) per kilo to as much as 14 pounds, widely dubbed a ""potato crisis"" by local newspapers and which has become a hot topic of conversation on the street.
The remarks hit a nerve with Egyptians battered by years of IMF-backed austerity measures and rising food prices, prompting a wave of criticism and jokes on social media.
A Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) poll run by a local news service based in Egypt's port city of Alexandria asked people whether they would rather build a worthwhile country or eat potatoes. The poll registered approximately 24,000 votes, 89 percent of which were for ""eat potatoes.""
Another Facebook post read: ""A choice between potatoes and rice or salad that's normal, but potatoes and a worthwhile country?""
The humor provided an opportunity for Egyptians to vent their frustration. Sisi has shut down most avenues for dissent since his election in 2014, saying he is trying to stabilize the country after the turmoil provoked by a 2011 uprising.
Austerity reforms are a key challenge for Sisi. Egypt is committed to the reforms under a $12 billion IMF loan deal agreed in 2016 and aimed at attracting foreign investment. 
Under the program, the government devalued the currency and has been gradually cutting fuel subsidies, putting tens of millions of Egyptians under strain as costs of living rise. 
The provision of cheap food has been a constant of Egypt's politics since the 1960s, and recent reforms have so far left its massive food subsidy system untouched. 
When Egyptians complained of shortages in food products, including poultry, the government stepped in to ensure availability.
But more austerity measures are expected in the coming months. 
""Obviously it's painful as we just started taking antibiotics in 2016, and the course should continue until we see through the whole program and fix things for good from a sustainability standpoint,"" Allen Sandeep, head of research at Naeem Brokerage, said. 
""We are still not out of the flu. Still on antibiotics.""
Sisi, who has encouraged Egyptians to be more physically active, was in top form last weekend riding his bike around Sharm al-Sheikh with much media fanfare. 
But a later comment on widespread obesity amongst the country's youth suggesting most college students should shed half their weight appeared to strike a wrong chord. 
Facebook hashtags including #fatsagainstthepresident and #togetheragainstfrenchfries poked fun at both Sisi's remarks, with one Facebook post calling for a campaign for a nation with no potatoes.

The deal, announced earlier this year, is the first military contract signed by the kingdom with a foreign country since the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which caused a global outcry. 
The signing ceremony was held on Tuesday in Riyadh, said the state-run Saudi Press Agency, which carried photographs of the event. 
Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist critical of the Saudi government and its de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, disappeared at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. 
Saudi officials initially insisted Khashoggi had left the consulate, then said he died in an unplanned ""rogue operation"". The kingdom’s public prosecutor Saud al-Mojeb later said he was killed in a premeditated attack.
The Spanish defense industry has come under fire for supplying weapons to Saudi Arabia because of concerns their use is causing civilian casualties in Yemen.

1559,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2018 11:21AM ET</span>",European defense coalition launched in Paris,"PARIS (Reuters) - A coalition of European militaries ready to react to crises near the continent's borders was launched on Wednesday with Finland becoming the 10th country to join, amid calls by French President Emmanuel Macron for a ""real European army"".
The French-led initiative would not conflict with the almost 70-year-old, U.S.-dominated NATO alliance, proponents say, but reflects in part concerns about a more isolationist United States under President Donald Trump.
The European Intervention Initiative took official shape in Paris after months of negotiations with Germany, who France wants at the center of the force.
Macron proposed the idea more than a year ago but was met with scepticism by other European Union nations, the idea coinciding with the EU's launch of a landmark defense pact meant to promote joint military investment. 
Germany, Belgium, Britain, Denmark, Estonia, the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal have all given their green light for the French-led move. It will see members collaborate on planning, on the analysis of new military and humanitarian crises, and on eventual military responses to those crises. 
""In an environment where threats and upheavals of a geopolitical or climatic nature are multiplying, the initiative must send the message that Europe is ready, that Europe is capable,"" a French defense ministry official said.
The imminent departure from the EU of Britain, long opposed to EU military collaboration outside NATO, has revived talk of defense cooperation - as have concerns that Trump might prove less willing than his predecessors to come to Europe's defense in the face of a newly assertive Russia. 
The initiative does not ""contradict or circumvent the EU's historic defense efforts, nor those of NATO,"" the defense official said. ""On the contrary, it will only improve interoperability between the participating countries.""
On Tuesday, Macron called for a ""real European army"" to reduce dependence on the United States.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has long been a vocal supporter of the idea that the EU should have more common defense capability, separate from NATO.
Not everyone is convinced. 
""Pragmatic advances and patient construction with those who are ready and willing for a political convergence in defense are infinitely preferable to totally illusory and even counterproductive slogans and incantations,"" said Arnaud Danjean, a member of the foreign and defense committee at the European parliament.

The march was being organized partly by far-right nationalist groups, one of which said it would defy the ban.
A rally is held annually in the capital on Nov. 11 to commemorate the anniversary of Poland's independence at the end of World War One. Last year's event was marked by racist chanting and confrontations with counter-protestors.
""Warsaw has already suffered enough due to aggressive nationalism,"" Mayor Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz said. ""Poland's 100th anniversary of independence shouldn't look like this, hence my decision to forbid it."" 
Some of the march's organizers said they were planning on showing up regardless. 
""We don't understand the decision of Mayor Gronkiewicz-Waltz ... Even if the courts confirm her decision, we will still meet ... The march will take place,"" said Tomasz Dorosz, the leader of Poland's National Radical Camp, one of the groups involved in organizing the march.
Earlier this week Gronkiewicz-Waltz said she would consider banning the march ""if there was any element of hatred"", according to local Polish broadcaster TVN24.
President Andrzej Duda's office said he had invited Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki to discuss the ban.
Duda had already decided to stay away from the event, which last year drew around 60,000 people, including representatives of far-right groups from across Poland and Europe.
At the time participants chanted anti-migrant slogans, many of which were also written on banners. This drew condemnation from a variety of groups, including Jewish organizations. 
Poland's PiS government has refused to take in Middle Eastern and North African migrants, despite European Union demands to do so, citing public safety worries.
However, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who heads the ruling party, condemned the racist messages during the 2017 march. 
""Polish tradition - the one we invoke - has nothing to do with anti-Semitism, we are as far as possible from that, nothing to do with racism,"" he said.

On Nov. 11 Poles commemorate the establishment of the second Polish republic in 1918 from territory seized in the 18th century by the Russian, Austrian and Prussian empires.

1561,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2018 10:31AM ET</span>","Exclusive: U.N., Western powers quietly bury December plan for Libya election","By Ulf Laessing and Aidan Lewis
TUNIS/CAIRO (Reuters) - The United Nations and Western powers have given up hope that Libya will hold elections in the immediate future, focusing on reconciliation first among rival factions locked in a cycle of conflict, diplomats and other sources said.
In May, France had persuaded major players in the North African country to verbally agree to elections on Dec. 10 as a way of ending repeated rounds of bloodshed between competing factions that emerged after a 2011 NATO-backed uprising.
But weeks of fighting between rival militias in the capital Tripoli and deadlock between rump parliaments in Tripoli and the east has made that goal unrealistic, Western officials argue.
Shelving the plans for presidential and parliamentary elections is the latest setback for Western powers that helped topple Muammar Gaddafi seven years ago before stepping back and seeing hopes for a democratic transition crumble. 
Instead of pushing for a vote as a short-term goal, U.N. Special Envoy Ghassan Salame will focus in a briefing to the U.N. Security Council on Thursday on staging a national conference next year and fixing the economy, diplomats said.
The conference would aim to forge consensus in a country divided between hundreds of armed groups controlling mostly minimal territory, towns, tribes and regions.
Libya has two governments, a U.N.-backed administration in the capital and a largely powerless eastern version aligned with influential veteran commander Khalifa Haftar, whose forces control much of the east.
Salame will also push again for economic reforms to end a system benefiting armed groups that have access to cheap dollars due to their power over banks. 
There was no immediate comment from the Tripoli-based government or the eastern-based parliament.
Diplomats say delayed reforms introduced in Tripoli in September, including a fee on purchases of foreign currency, can only partially ease Libya's economic woes as long as the central bank remains divided and predatory factions retain their positions.
The reforms have so far done little to improve conditions for ordinary Libyans hit by steep inflation and a cash crisis linked to the fall of the dinar on the black market.
For the militias, the sources said Salame would outline a new ""security arrangement"" for Tripoli aimed at depriving them of control of key sites and integrating their members into regular forces -- something that has proved elusive in the past.
HAFTAR'S ROLE
Salame is the sixth U.N. special envoy for Libya since 2011.
Talks to unify rival camps launched in September 2017, shortly after Salame took up his post, ground to a halt after one month with Haftar's role a key sticking point. Many in western Libya oppose him, fearing he could use the position to seize power.
Haftar's Libyan National Army says it is committed to the election process, in which Haftar himself is a possible candidate.
U.N. efforts to stabilize Libya have long been undercut by the divergent agendas of foreign powers. 
The international community formally backs the transitional government in Tripoli, but Egypt and the United Arab Emirates have lent Haftar support and European states including France courted the commander as his power grew.
France led the push for elections, believing it could benefit from helping fix the Libya conflict, before realizing the country was not ready for a vote, diplomats say.
""We have to accelerate the process, which is what Salame will say and push on with going to the ballot box,"" a French official said. ""The calendar on elections will slip, but that's not a problem.""
France has vied for influence with Italy, which has sought to protect its oil and gas interests and stem the flow of migrants crossing the Mediterranean by building ties in Tripoli, where it is the only Western country to fully reopen an embassy.
Italy is hosting a conference in Palermo next week, where Salame's roadmap will be discussed. 
In recent weeks, Western powers and the United Nations have quietly stopped talking about the election in December, without formally declaring it dead.
""The idea is now that Salame will talk about a national conference and economic reforms so people hope the Dec. 10 date will quietly pass away,"" said one source familiar with U.N. plans.
Elections remain the goal, but progress on the ground towards better governance and security were needed in place of ""extended additional thinking sessions"", said a senior U.S. administration official.
""I think pinning everything on a single date for an election has not proved a successful strategy,"" the official said.

""We are personally less vested in a date than the quality of the election, and I do think we have some work to do.""

BEIT UR AL-FAUQA, West Bank (Reuters) - Tuning into the news at dawn on Wednesday, the extended family of Rashida Tlaib, the first Palestinian-American woman to be elected to the U.S. Congress, celebrated her victory in their home in the Israeli occupied West Bank.
Tlaib, a Democrat, ran virtually unopposed in Michigan's 13th congressional district, which encompasses southwest Detroit and its suburbs west to the city of Dearborn. She previously served in Michigan's state legislature.
She has become ""a source of pride for Palestine and the entire Arab and Muslim world,"" her uncle, Bassam Tlaib, said in the small village of Beit Ur Al-Fauqa.
With her win, Tlaib, 44, will become the first Palestinian-American woman to serve in the U.S. Congress. Alongside incoming Minnesota Representative Ilhan Omar, she will also be one of the first Muslim women to join the congressional ranks.
""I'm going to speak truth to power,"" Tlaib told the Detroit Free Press on election night on Tuesday. ""I obviously have a set agenda that's not going to be a priority for the current president but that doesn't mean I'm not going to push back.""
Tlaib's district is home to one of the largest Arab-American populations in the United States. Her win highlights a wave of Palestinian diaspora candidates and activists who have embraced the Democratic Party's progressive wing at a low point in U.S.-Palestinian relations under Republican President Donald Trump.
In California's 50th district, Ammar Campa-Najjar, a Palestinian-American who spent part of his childhood in Gaza and whose father served in the Palestinian Authority, was in a close race with incumbent Republican Congressman Duncan Hunter, early results showed.
""The success of [Tlaib and Campa-Najjar's] progressive messaging on a wide range of issues, including Palestine, is reflective of a shifting public discourse that Palestine activists have played a role in shaping,"" said Omar Baddar, deputy director of the Washington-based Arab American Institute. 
CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM
Under Trump, Washington has alienated Palestinians by recognizing contested Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moving the American embassy there, and by slashing U.S. funding of the U.N. body that aids Palestinians.
Palestinians have broken off contact with his administration, which has promised to announce a peace plan soon for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
In the West Bank city of Ramallah and throughout the territory, Palestinians took a cautious view of the election news.
""Change is incremental, and Palestinians in Palestine are intimately aware of that,"" said Salem Barahmeh, executive director of the Ramallah-based Palestine Institute for Public Diplomacy.
""That said, Tlaib's election is seen as a glimmer of hope in a very dark chapter in the Palestinian people's history,"" Barahmeh added.

Bassam Tlaib, the candidate's uncle, said she had ""stood against Trump"" at a time when ""even our Arab leaders are unwilling to face (him).""

KADUNA, Nigeria (Reuters) - The leader of Nigeria's minority Shi'ite Muslims was denied bail on Wednesday, days after the group said more than 40 of its members had been killed by security forces shooting at protesters calling for his release.
Ibrahim Zakzaky, leader of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN), has been held in detention since December 2015, when the army killed roughly 350 of his followers at his compound and a nearby mosque and burial ground in northern Kaduna state.
He is facing trial for murder, culpable homicide, unlawful assembly, disruption of public peace and other charges following the 2015 violence. He was charged in April and has pleaded not guilty.
At the Kaduna High Court, in a regular hearing as part of the case, Justice Gideon Kurada said no substantial medical evidence had been produced to grant Zakzaky bail.
Kurada said he should remain in custody throughout the period of his trial. The next hearing is set for Jan. 22, 2019.
""We are disappointed with the court's decision,"" said Ibrahim Musa, an IMN spokesman, adding that Zakzaky should have been granted bail due to poor health. 
""We will keep on with our protests in Abuja and other cities,"" Musa said.
The treatment of IMN and Zakzaky's detention for nearly three years have drawn criticism from human rights groups and raised fears that the group may become radicalised - just as the Sunni Muslim militant group Boko Haram turned into a violent insurgency in 2009 after police killed its leader.
On three separate days last month, security forces opened fire with live ammunition on IMN members in the capital, Abuja, where they marched in their hundreds to demand Zakzaky's release.
AN IMN youth leader, Abdullahi Muhammed, said on Wednesday the death toll among the group's supporters now stood at 47.
The army has said three protesters were killed. A Reuters reporter counted 20 bodies at one burial.
Around half of Nigeria's 190 million people are Muslims, nearly all of them Sunnis. 
Zakzaky has attracted an estimated three million followers as a preacher of Shi'ite Islam since being drawn to that branch of the faith by the 1979 revolution in Iran.

Before Zakzaky was charged, authorities ignored a court ruling that he be released, sparking protests from his followers. IMN protests have frequently been met with force.

""Russia has been permissive, in consultation with the Israelis, about Israeli strikes against Iranian targets inside Syria. We certainly hope that that permissive approach will continue,"" Ambassador James Jeffrey, Washington's Syria envoy, said in a conference call with reporters. 
Moscow said in October it had delivered the S-300 surface-to-air missiles to Syria, after accusing Israel of indirectly causing the downing of a Russian military jet by Syrian air defenses following an Israeli air strike nearby. 
Like Russia, Iran is a key military supporter of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Israel regards the Islamic republic as its most dangerous enemy and has staged repeated air raids against its military and allied militia deployed in Syria. 
""Israel has an existential interest in blocking Iran from deploying long-range power projection systems ... inside Syria to be used against Israel. We understand the existential interest and we support Israel,"" Jeffrey said.
The downing of the Russian jet in September underscored the risks attached to the presence of numerous foreign militaries operating in proximity in Syria, he added. 
""Our immediate effort is to try to calm that situation down and then move on to a long-term solution."" 
U.S. policy is to ensure the enduring defeat of Islamic State, work on a solution to the conflict under the terms of United Nations Security Council resolution 2254 and ensure all Iranian-commanded forces leave Syria entirely, he said.
The United States seeks to regularize ceasefires now in place in Syria, move towards a political solution and then have all foreign forces that have entered the conflict since 2011 leave, except Russia. 
""The Russians, having been there before, would not in fact withdraw, but you've got four other outside military forces - the Israelis, the Turkish, the Iranian and the American - all operating inside Syria right now. It's a dangerous situation,"" Jeffrey said. 
Iran has said it will stay in Syria as long as Assad wants it to. Turkey has staged two incursions into northern Syria since 2016 aimed at curbing the role of Kurdish forces that the United States is supporting against Islamic State. 
Jeffrey said Washington took Turkish concerns about its support for the Kurdish fighters seriously. It had limited its weapons supply to the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces to light arms, something which had slowed recent operations against Islamic State, he said.

The gang, which authorities dubbed ""the Soulless Human Traffickers,"" preyed on poor pregnant women and persuaded them to give up their babies, the office added in a statement.
One five-month-old baby was rescued in an early Tuesday police raid on 18 properties in the southern city of Arequipa, officials said, adding that those arrested included Becerra and 13 others including a pediatrician and a gynecologist who were accused of being members of the criminal group.
Authorities said they believe Becerra's romantic partner, Cintia Tello, was ringleader of the gang.
Becerra and Tello could not be reached for comment.
Becerra became head of Peru's national police force in November 2010, during the government of former president Alan Garcia. He served about a year, and was replaced in October 2011, after a subordinate accused him of sexual harassment, according to local newspaper El Comercio. Becerra denied the sexual harassment accusations.

The migrants, who included 275 men, 32 women and eight children from different sub-Saharan and Arab countries, were moved to detention centers.
Libya's western coast is a main departure point for migrants fleeing wars and poverty and hoping for new lives in Europe, though the number of crossings has dropped sharply since July 2017.
Coast Guard spokesman Ayoub Qassem said a patrol rescued 116 illegal migrants in an inflatable boat 50 miles off the town of Zawiya. A further 199 migrants were picked up from two inflatable boats off Kums.

1568,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2018 09:22AM ET</span>",Italy government wins confidence vote amid coalition tensions,"By Crispian Balmer and Angelo Amante
ROME (Reuters) - Italy's coalition government comfortably won a confidence vote on Wednesday in the upper house Senate on a contested security decree, but tensions between the two ruling parties remain on a raft of issues.
    The bill, championed by Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, head of the far-right League, tightens immigration regulations, limits the right to asylum, and bolsters anti-terrorism and anti-mafia rules.
Despite some misgivings within the ranks of the League's coalition ally, the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, the government won the vote by 163 to 59, with only five 5-Star senators refusing to cast a ballot.
""This is a historic day,"" said a delighted Salvini, who has pinned his credibility on the package he says will cut the number of migrants staying in Italy.
The bill must now go to the lower chamber for approval.
Had it lost the motion, the government would have been forced to resign.
The decision to call a confidence vote, which is a way to force legislation through by truncating debate, signaled turbulence within the coalition which took office in June and has shaken financial markets with its economic policies.
While the security bill caused some internal discomfort, there is greater friction within the government over efforts by the 5-Star to loosen time limits imposed on the prosecution of numerous crimes, including corruption.
The League says easing the statute of limitations means defendants could face unacceptably long legal battles. Five-Star says that as things stand too many cases are rubbed out without a verdict ever being reached.
Corriere della Sera newspaper quoted anonymous League sources as saying there was a growing prospect of a snap election in March.
Salvini looked to calm the tensions, telling reporters: ""I am convinced that within a few hours we will have reached a deal (on the statute of limitations). People who have common sense always strike a deal.
""The jackals should resign themselves to the fact that this government will carry on working for the next five years.""
Other policy differences are straining the coalition, including a 5-Star proposal to introduce an income support scheme next year for Italy's many poor and unemployed.
That was a key 5-Star election promise and was included in the 2019 budget. However, the European Union has told Rome to reduce its spending plans and the League has questioned the welfare reform.
League politician Giancarlo Giorgetti said at the weekend that implementing the ""citizens' wage"" would be ""complicated"".

5-Star head Luigi Di Maio, was quoted as saying by Corriere that he was tired of all the strains: ""I have been good and nice, but that's going to stop.""

Separately, a senior political source close to Hezbollah told Reuters it was up to President Michel Aoun, a Maronite Christian, to resolve the problem because neither Hezbollah nor Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri could give ground.
Six months since a parliamentary election, the row over Sunni representation is seen as the final hurdle to the formation of a new government. Posts in the 30-seat cabinet are parceled out along sectarian lines. 
Lebanon is in dire need of a government able to make economic reforms that are seen as more pressing than ever. The country is wrestling with the world's third largest public debt as a proportion of the economy and stagnant growth.
A deal seemed close last week when a dispute over Christian representation was settled, with the anti-Hezbollah Christian Lebanese Forces ceding ground to Aoun and his Free Patriotic Movement, which is allied to Hezbollah.
But Hezbollah, a powerful armed group backed by Iran, is pressing its demand for one of its Sunni allies to be given a cabinet portfolio to reflect gains they made in the May 6 parliamentary election. 
Al-Akhbar, citing unidentified sources, said Aoun and Hariri must listen to Hezbollah's Sunni allies ""and agree with them on a way out"" of the row. ""Hezbollah will accept whatever the allies find appropriate,"" it said.
Hariri, Lebanon's leading Sunni who is currently on a visit to France, has ruled out ceding one of his cabinet seats to the Hezbollah-allied Sunnis. 
Another possibility would be for Aoun to nominate one of the Hezbollah-allied Sunnis within a group of ministers allocated to him. But he appeared to rule this out last week when he criticized the Hezbollah-allied Sunnis for demanding a ministry, saying their demand was ""not proper"" or ""justified"".
The senior political source close to Hezbollah said the ball was in Aoun's court.

""Neither can Hariri retreat, nor can the (Hezbollah-allied) Sunnis, nor can Hezbollah. If the president wants a government he has to take the responsibility,"" the source said.

Comoros will reverse a March 21 decision to refuse to accept Comoros citizens turned away from the island of Mayotte, which is officially part of France, although Comoros claims it. In turn, France will rescind a suspension on visas for Comorians.
Faced with a wave of migrants this year, many of them pregnant women hoping to give birth in Mayotte so their children could become French, France this year began deporting would-be immigrants back to Comoros.
Comoros considers Mayotte, 400 km (250 miles) east of Mozambique, as part of its archipelago.
But Mayotte is a former French colony that voted against independence in 1974 and 1976. In 2009, its people voted overwhelmingly to become a full part of France.
That has kept Mayotte richer and more stable than the coup-prone Comoros, and many Comorians try to move to Mayotte.
Further agreed steps will be set out in a document to be signed later this month, the two foreign ministries said in a joint statement.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan has removed the acting chief of state-run television after a caption read ""Begging"" instead ""Beijing"" during a broadcast of Prime Minister Imran Khan's visit to China, which has promised economic aid to the impoverished South Asian country.
Khan was in Beijing seeking financial aid to help end a spiraling balance of payments crisis after securing $6 billion in support from Saudi Arabia and before Pakistan sat down to talks with the IMF.
An official Ministry of Information order seen by Reuters said the ministry had withdrawn the services of Hasan Immad Mohammadi, who had served as acting managing director of Pakistan Television for just a matter of weeks.
PTV apologized after ""Begging"" ran on screens for 20-25 seconds on Monday while Khan was making a speech, kicking off a debate on social media as to whether the misspelling was deliberate.
Khan has criticized Pakistan's many international bailouts and decried previous leaders as roaming the world with a begging bowl. 
An information ministry spokesman said the misspelling had nothing to do with Mohammadi's removal, saying it was a ""routine affair"".
Finance Minister Asad Umar said on Tuesday that ""Pakistan's immediate balance of payment crisis is over"", adding that the combined Saudi support plus as-yet-unspecified aid promised by China had shored up foreign currency reserves.
Umar spoke a day before the arrival on Wednesday of an IMF team for a two-week visit to Islamabad to negotiate Pakistan's request for a 13th IMF bailout since the 1980s.

He has previously said the country needs $12 billion in immediate relief.

HANOI/SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, will visit Vietnam this month to learn about its model of economic reform, a diplomatic source and media reported on Wednesday.
Ri will visit the Vietnamese capital, Hanoi, for three days from Nov. 27 to inspect industrial zones and interview economic experts, a diplomatic source with direct knowledge of the trip told Reuters.
South Korea's Yonhap news agency, citing unidentified sources, also reported that Ri would make the three-day trip at that time.
Vietnam's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. South Korea's foreign ministry said it was not aware of Ri's visit.
After years of self-imposed isolation, and sanctions for its development of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, North Korea has this year been trying to build its foreign contacts.
Its leader, Kim Jong Un, has spoken of his hopes for reform of North Korea's economy and has looked to examples in the region.
Kim met South Korean President Moon Jae-in three times this year. In their talks, Kim repeatedly cited Vietnam's successes, South Korean media reported.
Kim also help a summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Singapore in June, when he was cited by North Korean media as expressing his admiration for Singapore's economic development.

The case was raised to the Luxembourg justices by a Scottish court, where politicians opposed to Brexit asked for a ruling to clarify the interpretation of Article 50 of the EU treaty, under which London last year gave two years' notice of its departure.
No other member state has ever left the 60-year-old bloc.
Establishing that reversing the Brexit process can be done without the approval of other EU states would, argue those who brought the case, boost their argument that British lawmakers should block the withdrawal before it happens on March 29.
It is not clear when the ECJ might rule on the issue, known as the Wightman Case after Andy Wightman, a member of the Scottish parliament from the Green party, who led the action.
A court official said that typically, under the court's ""expedited procedure"" for urgent matters, a ruling would be made three to six months after such a hearing. However, the ECJ noted in an order last month that there was ""undeniably"" a need for an urgent ruling before the British parliament votes on whether or not to accept a treaty with the EU setting out divorce terms.
British Prime Minister Theresa May insists that Britain will leave the EU in March. But she faces a battle in parliament to approve any potential treaty, on which negotiations are deadlocked over how to manage the Irish border. In principle, she could seek a parliamentary vote as early as this month.
A leaked government memo published by the BBC on Tuesday suggested that the date of the Luxembourg hearing, Nov. 27, could be exactly the day that May asks lawmakers to vote -- leaving the ECJ's opinion in the matter moot.
A spokeswoman for May's government said that it was seeking to appeal the decision by Scotland's Court of Session to go to the ECJ at Britain's Supreme Court. ""It remains a matter of firm policy that we will not be revoking the Article 50 notice, and we will not comment further on ongoing litigation,"" she added.
On Tuesday, the government said it had submitted written observations to the ECJ, restating its position that the court should dismiss the case as it has long refused to rule on hypothetical questions or provide advisory opinions.
Article 50 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty sets a two-year limit for a state to negotiate a withdrawal treaty with the EU. That treaty must be approved by a specially calculated majority of the other member states. The article also says the two-year negotiation period can be extended if all other states agree. 

It does not address the issue of whether the country asking to leave can simply change its mind and retain membership without seeking the approval of the other EU countries.

CHARLEVILLE-MEZIERES, France (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday it was ""legitimate"" to pay tribute to Marshal Philippe Petain, who led the French army to victory in World War One's Battle of Verdun but decades later collaborated with Nazi Germany during World War Two.
Macron's plan to honor Petain alongside seven other French marshals who directed military campaigns during World War One, which ended 100 years ago on Nov. 11, has unleashed criticism from Jewish groups, political opponents and on social media.
""I consider it entirely legitimate that we pay homage to the marshals who led our army to victory,"" Macron said in the eastern town of Charleville-Mezieres that once lay on the front line between French and German troops. 
""Marshal Petain was a great soldier in World War One.""
Renowned as a ""soldier's soldier"", Petain was promoted to commander-in-chief of the French armies in mid-1917, after victory at Verdun, rebuilding troop morale after a series of mutinies and other setbacks.
Verdun was the longest battle of World War One, killing more than 300,000 French and German soldiers during 10 months of trench battles. Petain emerged from the Great War as a national hero with streets in towns and cities across France named after him.
Two decades later, with France poised to fall to Nazi German forces in World War Two, Petain was appointed prime minister of France. His administration, based in the unoccupied part of the country known as Vichy France, collaborated with Nazi Germany and its deportation and extermination of the Jews.
After the war, Petain was sentenced to death for treason, though then-President General Charles de Gaulle, a longtime admirer of Petain, reduced the punishment to life in prison. 
""It is shocking that France can pay tribute to a man deemed unworthy of being French in a trial held in the name of the people,"" said Francis Kalifat, president of Crif, the body that represents France's 400,000-strong Jewish community.
Jean-Luc Melenchon, head of the hard-left France Insoumise (France Unbowed) party, wrote on Twitter: ""Marshal Joffre was the military victor of the 1914-18 war. Petain was a traitor and an anti-Semite. His crimes and his betrayal cannot be erased from history. Macron, this time, you've gone to far."" 

Petain died in prison in 1951 aged 95.

VERDUN, France (Reuters) - In a hospital mortuary in eastern France, the forensic doctor Bruno Fremont examines a gaping hole in the skull of a soldier killed by shrapnel a century ago, at the Battle of Verdun during World War One. 
Laid out on a white sheet are the combatant's near-complete skeleton, many of the bones blackened, and his leather boots, the laces tied tight. What's missing is the soldier's ID tag. 
For months, Fremont has searched for clues as to the identity of the soldier, whose remains were found in March by workmen resurfacing a road. He has all but lost hope. A DNA test is useless without a known relative to compare against. 
""A tag is the only item that would have allowed us to formally identify him,"" said Fremont, acknowledging the sadness and frustration of not being able to make an identification.
""The boots are those that were on his feet when he died, and they are French army boots. But they're not proof of his nationality. On his left side he carried a wallet that contained two French coins. And we found a gas mask near his skull, a French-issued M2 gas mask.
""So in all likelihood he was French. But we cannot be wholly certain.""
A century after the end of the war, President Emmanuel Macron will lead commemorations to mark the anniversary this weekend. World leaders will attend, including U.S. President Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
But even as the world marks the passage of so much time since the conflict, the tumult it caused continues to affect families whose relatives never returned from the battlefields.
The Battle of Verdun, fought between French and German troops for much of 1916, was the longest and among the deadliest of World War One. Altogether, almost 300,000 soldiers were killed. 
Even now the ground continues to give up the fallen.
On Tuesday, Macron lit a flame at the Douaumont Ossuary, a memorial containing the remains of soldiers who died at Verdun and where Fremont's skeleton will be interred if it cannot be identified.
A MOTHER'S REGRET
Verdun did not spare Fremont's family. His grandfather was wounded in the fighting. As a child he would scour the forests that now cover the battlefield and collect bullet casings and soldiers' helmets.
Nowadays, when remains are found, Fremont is tasked by the local prosecutor with ascertaining if the bones are human and whether they date from the war. After all, he says, a serial killer called ""the Ogre of the Ardennes"" once lived in Verdun. 
The bodies of 80,000 soldiers were never recovered from Verdun. They lie buried in an area known as the ""red zone"". More often than not, Fremont said, it is only fragments of bone that are found, from bodies ripped apart by shells.
On rare occasions, Fremont finds his holy grail: a soldier's identification tag. In 2015, workers renovating a Verdun war memorial unearthed three skeletons. After hours of searching, a tag was found - but there was no guarantee it belonged to the remains.
The tag bore the name Claude Fournier as well as the date and town where he registered with the army: Macon.
The discovery lead Fremont on an impassioned search for a living relative of Fournier and a DNA match. Two years later he found one: Fournier's grandson Robert Allard, who was living in Cannes. 
""It was so emotional,"" Allard said. ""It had been my mother's greatest regret in life that she never knew where her father died.""
It was the first and only time the remains of an unknown French soldier from the Great War have been identified by DNA.
The memory brings a tear to Fremont's eyes. Yet it also compounds the disappointment of being unable to put a name to the delicate skeleton before him.

""It's frustrating,"" the doctor said. ""Because perhaps somewhere there is a family hoping they will one day find their relative.""

Fed up with corruption and an inefficient political system, Latvian voters punished the former three-party right-of-centre ruling in the October 6 election. Three new parties took around 40 percent of the votes, leading to a widely fragmented parliament consisting of seven parties.

1580,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2018 06:50AM ET</span>",Leaked British memo gives a taste of PM May's possible Brexit finale,"LONDON (Reuters) - A memorandum leaked from within the British government gives a taste of a possible finale to the Brexit drama: Prime Minister Theresa May hails a deal in just over 10 days, supporters cheer as arranged, and the pact is put to a vote in parliament on Nov. 27.
May's office dismissed the document, which was published on Tuesday by the BBC, and said the poor spelling and childish language indicated it did not represent government thinking, though a spokesman did not explicitly deny the document was genuine.
Less than five months before the United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union on March 29, a deal is nearly done, but officials have repeatedly cautioned they are still haggling over the Irish border issue.
According to the communications memorandum, headed ""Brexit Communications Grid Summary"", May's cabinet was to review the deal on Nov. 6, with Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab announcing decisive progress on Nov. 8. 
After a deal was clinched, leaders such as Japan's prime minister would tweet in support. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar's name was spelled incorrectly.
""The big picture is that a deal is close,"" said Anand Menon, professor of European politics at King's College.
Like others named in the document as figures who should publicly back the deal, Menon said he had not been contacted about giving choreographed support.
""The big unknown is we don't know how parliament will respond to the deal,"" he said.
It is unclear whether May can get the British parliament to support a Brexit deal: About 320 votes are needed to win, but May's 315 Conservative lawmakers are not united behind her plans.
The memo said the vote would take place on Nov. 27:
""Evening is the vote. HISTORIC MOMENT, PUT YOUR OWN INTERESTS ASIDE, PUT THE COUNTRY’S INTERESTS FIRST AND BACK THIS DEAL,"" the leaked document said.
If May fails to clinch a Brexit deal with the EU, or parliament votes down her deal, then the United Kingdom would face leaving the EU without a divorce deal, and thus without a transition period.

Many business chiefs and investors fear a ""no-deal"" Brexit would weaken the West, panic financial markets and block the arteries of trade.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia authorities extended on Wednesday a search for victims of a plane crash last week, when all 189 on board a Lion Air flight were killed, and for the aircraft's second black box, the cockpit voice recorder.
The nearly new Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. 737 MAX passenger plane slammed into the sea on Oct. 29, only minutes after takeoff from Jakarta en route to Bangka island near Sumatra.
""We have extended the operation for three more days,"" Muhammad Syaugi, the head of the national search and rescue agency (Basarnas), told Reuters.
It was the second time the search has been extended.
But he said search teams from the military, police and others would stand down, leaving just his agency to press on.
""This operation has been running for 10 days and the results from combing the sea surface and the sea bed are declining, therefore the resources of Basarnas should be sufficient,"" Syaugi told a news conference.
Basarnas had 220 personnel, including 60 divers, as well as four ships involved in the search and were focusing on an area with a radius of 250 meters (273 yards), he said. 
A police official said 186 body bags containing human remains had been retrieved and 44 victims identified after forensic examination.
Authorities have downloaded data from one of the black boxes found last week, the flight data recorder, but are still looking for the cockpit voice recorder 
A ""ping"" has been detected from the second black box but the signal was very weak, possibly because it was encased in mud,"" said Nurcahyo Utomo, an air accident official at the transportation safety committee (KNKT). 
A vessel capable of sucking up mud was likely to be brought in to help, he told a news conference. 
Boeing said on Wednesday it had issued a safety bulletin reminding pilots how to handle erroneous data from a sensor in the wake of the Lion Air crash.
The U.S. planemaker said investigators looking into the Lion Air crash had found that one of the ""angle of attack"" sensors on the aircraft had provided erroneous data.
Experts say the angle of attack is a crucial parameter that helps the aircraft's systems understand whether its nose is too high relative to the current of air - a phenomenon that can throw the plane into an aerodynamic stall and make it fall.
KNKT said that there was a problem with the sensor on the last flight taken by the doomed plane, from the island of Bali to Jakarta, even though one sensor had been replaced in Bali.
The KNKT has interviewed crew and technicians on duty for two previous flights, while also retrieving the faulty sensor from Bali for inspection.

KNKT is planning to simulate a flight to assess the impact of sensor damage at Boeing's engineering simulator facility in Seattle.

The courts will deal with lawsuits about government business that are currently covered in the general legal system, according to the text of a bill to set them up posted on parliament's website. Lawmakers will debate it later this year.
The EU has criticized a series of legal measures pushed through by Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, including the forced retirement of some judges. In September the European Parliament voted to impose sanctions on Hungary for flouting EU rules on democracy, civil rights and corruption. The government rejected the accusations.
Hungary's leftist opposition Democratic Coalition party said on Monday that the new courts, proposed by the government earlier this year, would let the ministers hand pick judges to hear legal challenges to state programs. 
""The government would end the independence of courts by setting up a new administrative court, in order to ensure that lawsuits against the state would land in the appropriate place, and the Orban regime would have the last say in the courts,"" the leftist party said in a statement.
Justice Minister Laszlo Trocsanyi told state TV the opposition was ""scaremongering"".
In the text of the legislation, posted online on Tuesday night, he said other European countries had similar administrative courts - and the reforms would ensure the country had a ""high quality of ... administrative judiciary"".
""The model will respect judges' independence ... and at the same time will establish the justice minister's political responsibility for the effective operation of administrative courts,"" he said in the bill.
Trocsanyi said the government would seek the opinion of the Venice Commission, a panel of constitutional law experts of the human rights body Council of Europe, about the legislation. 
According to the bill, the minister will invite applications to fill judges' positions at the new courts and nominate the judges based on the proposal of a national committee of administrative judges. If the minister does not agree with the committee's proposal, he can veto it.

The minister will also oversee the budgets of the new courts under the legislation.

DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh's ruling party has rejected an opposition party's demand for a caretaker government it says is essential for a free and fair general election due to be held in December. 
Although Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League had agreed to unprecedented talks last week with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) to discuss the arrangement, on Wednesday it declared the demand was unconstitutional. 
""Our prime minister told them there is no provision in our constitution to form such a caretaker government,"" said Obaidul Quader, her party's secretary general. 
The BNP, which is in disarray after the jailing of its chief, former prime minister Khaleda Zia, on corruption charges, also pressed for a caretaker government at the last general election in 2014.
When that demand was not met, it boycotted the poll.
The party and its allies were still undecided whether to participate in the election, BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir told Reuters.
Quader said the Awami League would ensure a level playing field by preventing ministers from using government buildings or vehicles for the next three months. 
Hasina and Khaleda, who between them have ruled Bangladesh for decades, are bitter rivals and the BNP says its leader has been jailed on trumped-up charges to keep her out of politics.
On Wednesday the Awami League also rejected BNP demands to reconsider Khaleda's sentence, which was doubled to 10 years on October 30, so ruling her out of December's contest.

""We told them the High Court already announced its verdict about Khaleda Zia,"" Quader said.

The militant had fired from Syria's Ras al-Ayn region into Turkey's Sanliurfa province, the source said.
Turkey considers the YPG militia a terrorist organization and an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has waged an insurgency against Turkey since 1984. 
Turkey's military has carried out two incursions into Syria against the YPG militia, both focusing on its presence to the west of the Euphrates River. 
President Tayyip Erdogan has signaled an impending operation against YPG forces the east of the river, delivering last month what he said was his ""final warning"" to those he said endangered Turkey's southern border with Syria.
The YPG spearheads the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces in the fight against Islamic State in Syria. Washington's support for the militia has infuriated Ankara.
Turkish forces last month bombarded YPG positions near Ayn al-Arab, Turkey's Anadolu news agency reported. It killed four Kurdish militants last week in a separate cross-border clash in the same region, broadcaster TRT reported.

The military government has promised to hold elections between February and May after repeated delays.
The race is set to be a contest between supporters of the military and royalist establishment and populist forces led by the Puea Thai Party that was ousted in a 2014 coup.
Members of the new Thai Raksa Chart Party include Thaksin and Yingluck's nephew and niece, close aides, and the younger generation of the clan's political allies. It will be headed by Preechapol Pongpanich, an ex-member of parliament with the Puea Thai Party. 
""It's a political strategy for Puea Thai under the new electoral system to win more seats,"" political scientist Yuttaporn Issarachai told Reuters. 
Parties linked to the Shinawatras have won every election in the past decade. But the military government's new constitution, which the military said aims to weaken major political parties, effectively cuts constituency seats in provinces where the Shinwatras have previously held dominance. 
He said the party would also serve as a ""back-up"" should Puea Thai be dissolved.
The Puea Thai Party faces dissolution after the junta ordered the Election Commission to investigate whether Thaksin was still controlling Puea Thai.
The former telecommunications tycoon was ousted in a 2006 coup and has since lived in self-imposed exile to avoid a graft conviction in 2008 he says was politically motivated. He faces separate corruption charges from 2008 and 2012.
Yingluck fled Thailand in August last year just before a court found her guilty of criminal negligence. She was handed down a five-year jail term in absentia.

HELSINKI (Reuters) - The chances of sealing a deal on Britain's withdrawal from the European Union this month are fading, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Wednesday.
EU leaders had previously penciled in a summit for mid-November to sign off on any Brexit deal with London. Negotiators from both sides, however, remain at odds over ways to guarantee there is no return of border controls on the frontier between Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland. 
""I do think that, with every day that passes, the possibility of having a special summit in November becomes less likely,"" Varadkar told reporters after meeting Finnish Prime Minister Juha Sipila.
""But we do have one scheduled for the 13th, 14th of December, so not getting it done in November doesn't mean we can't get it done in the first two weeks of December. But I think beyond that you're into the New Year, which I think wouldn't be a good thing.""
Brussels has proposed a ""backstop"" arrangement as part of the withdrawal agreement that would ensure an open border by keeping Northern Ireland inside the EU customs union and large parts of the single market. Britain has complained this would create a border in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.
Varadkar spoke to British Prime Minister Theresa May on Monday, agreeing that any backstop should be temporary. May also told him that there would need to be a mechanism to end it.
""For me, it's always about the objective, more so than the mechanism - what are you actually trying to achieve,"" Varadkar said on Wednesday. ""We hope that the backstop will never need to be used, it is an insurance policy.
Varadkar said he was willing to consider a review clause attached to the backstop, but this could not allow Britain to withdraw unilaterally and leave a hard border.

Varadkar is in Helsinki attending the two-day congress of the European People's Party.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen told his ministers to ease pressure on labor union leaders on Wednesday, after threats by the European Union to remove the Southeast Asian country's duty-free trading access.
The EU began a formal procedure last month to strip Cambodia of its ""Everything but Arms (EBA)"" initiative, following a July general election that returned Hun Sen to power after 33 years in office and gave his party all parliamentary seats.
In a speech to 20,000 factory workers on Wednesday, Hun Sen urged his ministries of justice and labor to speed up or drop any pending court cases against union leaders.
""Cases that should be handled, handle them quickly. Cases that are not being handled, drop them, finish them, so that those union leaders don't feel like hostages,"" Hun Sen said.
""This will open up some freedom space for the unions,"" he said. ""Let's make reconciliation and understanding of each other a priority.""
Hun Sen did not refer to the EU threat to remove trade preferences. 
The world's largest trading bloc has launched a six-month review of Cambodia's duty-free access, meaning its garments, sugar and other exports could face tariffs within 12 months, under EU rules.
Representatives from major apparel and footwear companies, including Adidas (DE:ADSGN) , New Balance,  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) , Puma , Under Armour, and VF Corporation (NYSE:VFC), met Cambodian government ministers on Oct. 19.
The companies urged the government to drop what are widely seen as politically motivated criminal charges against trade unionists.
""The prime minister has made a step toward honoring human rights obligations under the EBA agreement with the EU while wooing workers' support for his rule,"" said political analyst Lao Mong Hay said.
The repercussions of any EU sanctions on Cambodian garments could devastate an export industry which accounts for about 40 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP).
Ath Thon, the president of the Coalition of Cambodian Apparel Workers' Democratic Union, who has 7 pending lawsuits against him and another 50 against his colleagues over labor strikes, said he welcomed Hun Sen's comments.
""Let's wait and see how they will resolve this,"" Ath Thon told Reuters. 

""It could be that, firstly, the election is over and the situation is better so they want to solve problems and, secondly, that they want to respond to what development partners want.""

JAKARTA (Reuters) - East Timor's ruling coalition in parliament has voted to block a planned trip by President Francisco Guterres to the Vatican, where he was due to meet Pope Francis, saying the president must first break a political deadlock at home. 
The predominantly Roman Catholic nation has struggled to achieve stable government, and the stalemate has persisted since Guterres rejected some ministers proposed by Prime Minister Jose Maria de Vasconcelos after May elections over graft inquiries. 
In a statement on Wednesday, Guterres said he deeply regretted this week's vote by the ruling Alliance of Change for Progress (AMP) coalition in parliament ""blocking this excellent opportunity"".
The AMP won 34 of the 65 seats up for grabs in May's parliamentary election, the fifth since independence from Indonesia in 2002.
The AMP coalition includes the National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction (CNRT) party of independence hero Xanana Gusmao. Guterres is from the opposition Fretilin party. 
""I was greatly honored and proud to receive news that the Vatican State had approved my request for an audience with His Holiness Pope Francis,"" Guterres said, adding that the meeting had been set for November 23. 
Guterres said that parliament's vote had prevented him from personally inviting Pope Francis to visit the country in 2019, to mark the 30th anniversary of a visit by Pope John Paul II and also the 20th anniversary of its independence referendum.
""The visit of the Pope in 1989 drew international attention to the suffering of the people of Timor Leste (East Timor) and brought more support to our national liberation struggle,"" said Guterres.
Asia's youngest democracy, which became independent from Indonesia in 2002, has struggled to alleviate poverty, stamp out corruption and develop its rich oil and gas resources. 
Arao Noe, the president of parliament, said by telephone the rejection decision was taken because the appointment of cabinet ministers had been delayed by more than four months.
As well as visiting the Vatican, the president had also sought approval from parliament for a state visit to former colonial ruler Portugal, the United Nations and Indonesia before the end of the year.

A U.N-led convoy of more than 70 trucks arrived on Saturday under Russian army protection after months of delay in the first such first aid delivery from inside Syria to the rebel-held camp that has over 50,000 people.
""We finished distribution of all items, food, sanitation and hygiene supplies and core relief items,"" Fadwa AbedRabou Baroud, a U.N official with the convoy told Reuters.

The U.N. team will complete a vaccination campaign against measles, polio and other diseases to protect some 10,000 vulnerable children in the camp before it departs, Baroud said.
The U.S. State Department welcomed the aid to the camp, located close to the Tanf U.S. military base in the desert near where the borders of Syria, Jordan and Iraq converge.
The camp is within a ""deconfliction zone"" set up by U.S. forces. Damascus says U.S. troops are occupying Syrian territory and providing a safe haven for rebels.
Washington said it hoped Moscow would continue to put pressure on the Syrian government to comply with U.N. resolutions on allowing humanitarian access across frontlines. 
The camp was last month besieged on the Syrian side of the border by the Syrian army, preventing smugglers and traders from delivering food.
In the last three years, tens of thousands of people have fled to the camp from Islamic State-held parts of Syria being targeted by Russian and U.S.-led coalition air strikes.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - A year ago, rebel leader Berhanu Nega was coordinating attacks against Ethiopian soldiers from his base across the border in Eritrea and faced a death penalty at home.
In September, he returned to Ethiopia to address tens of thousands of cheering supporters in a stadium in the capital, Addis Ababa.
The journey of the mild-mannered former economics professor from exile to rock-star welcome says a lot about how much Ethiopia has changed in recent months. He is the most high profile of dozens of political dissidents, former rebels, and secessionist leaders who have come home since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took office in April. Their return has Ethiopians hopeful that the country of 105 million – Africa's second most populous – can finally embrace democracy.
There's still a long way to go.
The last two elections were decried by the opposition as shams following a messy poll in 2005, after which the government jailed popular opposition politicians like Berhanu. The clampdown fueled unrest and demands for greater political and social freedom. In recent years, the ruling EPRDF coalition cracked down even more harshly; security forces killed more than 1,000 protesters and jailed tens of thousands of people between 2015 and 2018, according to Human Rights Watch. It also shut off the internet, sometimes for months at a time.
""Seven, eight months ago the question was whether the country is going to survive or not, whether it's going to explode into a civil war,"" Berhanu, 59, told Reuters in a borrowed office in central Addis Ababa.
But in April, the ruling coalition installed Abiy as the new prime minister. The 42-year-old has promised to chart a new course and embrace multi-party democracy. Such a transition would buck the trend towards authoritarianism in nearby countries such as Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi, where leaders are jailing opponents and rolling back restrictions on term limits to extend their rule.
Within weeks of Abiy taking charge, Berhanu ordered the armed group he led, Ginbot 7, to stop attacking Ethiopian troops and end its armed struggle.
Abiy's arrival ""was real change,"" Berhanu said. ""It did not take us a minute... We have no particular interests in violence. We just said: 'Are you serious, is this something you are committed to? Yes, good, we are done'.""
Ethiopia's new leader, Berhanu said, ""really has this mission of changing society toward what he believes the public deserves: to live in freedom and democracy.""
Abiy's chief of staff Fitsum Arega did not respond to requests for comment for this story.
HUNGER FOR FREEDOM
Berhanu has opposed authoritarian rule for decades. In the late 1970s he was active against the Derg, the brutal military regime that ruled the county. That eventually landed him in jail. After escaping to Sudan, he was granted asylum in the United States where he obtained a doctorate in economics.
Back at home in 2005, he ran for municipal office in Addis Ababa. Ethiopians, he remembers, ""went out to vote until midnight, until 2 AM"".
But the government led by Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, a former rebel himself and the leader of a group that toppled the Derg in 1991, nullified the results. The government then jailed Berhanu and other opposition candidates.
After his release in 2007, he returned to his job as an economics professor at Bucknell University in Pennsylvania. 
In 2014, he moved to Eritrea's capital Asmara to work full time for Ginbot 7, which had moved from peaceful participation in the 2005 elections to ""an all-inclusive struggle"" that embraced violence as an acceptable way to bring change. The ruling EPRDF became ""more and more brutal"" he said, suggesting that it would never leave power ""through any kind of peaceful means"".
In Eritrea, he says, he was relatively safe from threats from the security apparatus across the border. He even traveled on an Eritrean passport and U.S. green card to visit his family in the U.S. What he longed for during those years was the opportunity to have a leisurely conversation over coffee in Addis Ababa's cafes.
He still does. Though he returned home to a hero's welcome, he is following the government's orders to exercise caution in public for his own safety.
""I'm very restricted in my own movements,"" he said. ""I am having a hard time living with (this). This is the price we pay for now, but it should not last"".
Abiy's reform pledges have opened up some political space. As well as allowing politicians such as Berhanu to return home and hold rallies, the government has released thousands of political prisoners and in July removed three opposition groups from its list of ""terrorist"" organizations. Not all former armed groups have laid down their arms – the Oromo Liberation Front, rebels who fell out with the EPRDF shortly after it took power in 1991, is arguing over disarming its fighters – but for the first time in years citizens are openly airing their views on the street and on social media without fear of arrest. 
Some in the ruling EPRDF worry that loosening the state's iron grip has created a security vacuum. Abiy warned recently that ""lawlessness"" was sweeping the country.
Berhanu believes a certain level of disorder is inevitable.
""At the macro level, change always generates this unsettled feeling. There's a lot of anxiety,"" he said, referring to the ethnic violence that has displaced one million Ethiopians in the seven months since Abiy took office.
""We are coming out of a regime not only known for its brutality but also for deliberately dividing society.""
LAST CHANCE
In his speeches, Berhanu, who sports a salt and pepper beard, has urged calm and patience.
His main message, he told Reuters, is that it is everyone's responsibility to ""work toward some kind of stability... a basic peaceful environment.""
After that, he hopes, society can begin discussing how to change laws and rebuild institutions – critical tasks if elections, due in 2020, are to be credible.
Then would come an even bigger question: Should the ethnic-based federal structure Ethiopia's ruling coalition set up 27 years ago be dismantled in favor of ""citizenship-based"" politics?
Berhanu and Ginbot 7 will play a big part in that debate according to one European diplomat. It comes down to ""Ethiopian nationalism vs ethno nationalism,"" the diplomat said. ""Where do you put the focus: On the rights of the individual, the citizen; or on the rights of the group, the ethnic group?""
In his interview with Reuters, Berhanu began to talk about that question and then cut himself short. ""The long term political arrangement"" is ""too sensitive"" to discuss now, he said.
Though he projects confidence in front of supporters, he is weighed down by a ""feeling of numbness"" given the scale of problems facing Ethiopia.

""We've screwed two changes,"", he said, referring to 1974, when members of the military toppled Emperor Haile Selassie, and 1991, when rebels deposed the military regime. ""If we screw this one, then that's it. I really don't believe we have another chance.""

1600,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2018 01:49AM ET</span>","Facing new sanctions, Iranians vent anger at rich and powerful","By Babak Dehghanpisheh
GENEVA (Reuters) - More Iranians are using social media to vent anger at what they see as the corruption and extravagance of a privileged few, while the majority struggles to get by in an economy facing tighter U.S. sanctions.
The country has been hit by a wave of protests during the last year, some of them violent, but as economic pressures rise, people are increasingly pointing fingers at the rich and powerful, including clerics, diplomats, officials and their families.
One person channeling that resentment is Seyed Mahdi Sadrossadati, a relatively obscure cleric who has amassed 256,000 followers on his Instagram account with a series of scathing posts aimed at children of the elite.
In one recent post, he blasted the ""luxury life"" of a Revolutionary Guards commander and his son, who posted a selfie online in front of a tiger lying on the balcony of a mansion.
Openly criticizing a well-known member of the powerful military unit that answers to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is in itself an unusual act of defiance.
""A house tiger? What's going on?"" Sadrossadati wrote. ""And this from a 25-year-old youth who could not gain such wealth. People are having serious difficulty getting diapers for their child.""
The Iranian rial currency has hit 149,000 to the U.S. dollar on the black market used for most transactions, down from around 43,000 at the start of 2018, as U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to pull out of the nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers aimed at curbing its nuclear program.
That has sent living costs sharply higher and made imports less accessible, while the threat of financial punishment from the United States has prompted many foreign companies to pull out of Iran or stay away.
The situation could get worse, as additional sanctions come into force this week.
(For graphic on plunging rial, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2D4zCA5)
""SULTAN OF COINS""
Wary of growing frustration over the relative wealth of a few among the population of 81 million, Khamenei has approved the establishment of special courts focused on financial crimes.
The courts have handed out at least seven death sentences since they were set up in August, and some of the trials have been broadcast live on television.
Among those sentenced to death was Vahid Mazloumin, dubbed the ""sultan of coins"" by local media, a trader accused of manipulating the currency market and who was allegedly caught with two tons of gold coins, according to the Iranian Students' News Agency (ISNA).
The tough sentences have not been enough to quell frustration, however, with high profile officials and clerics in the firing line.
""Because the economic situation is deteriorating, people are looking for someone to blame and in this way get revenge from the leaders and officials of the country,"" said Saeed Leylaz, a Tehran-based economist and political analyst.
Washington is likely to welcome signs of pressure on Iran's political and religious establishment, as it hopes that by squeezing the economy it can force Tehran to curb its nuclear program and row back on military and political expansion in the Middle East.
Public anger among Iranians has been building for some time.
Demonstrations over economic hardships began late last year, spreading to more than 80 cities and towns and resulting in at least 25 deaths.
CLERICS
In addition to his written contributions, Sadrossadati has posted videos of debates between himself and some of those he has criticized.
In one, he confronted Mehdi Mazaheri, the son of a former central bank governor who was criticized online after a photograph appeared showing him wearing a large gold watch.
In a heated exchange, Sadrossadati shouted: ""How did you get rich? How much money did you start out with and how much money do you have now? How many loans have you taken?""
Mazaheri, barely able to get in a reply, said he would be willing to share documents about his finances.
Children of more than a dozen other officials have been criticized online and are often referred to as ""aghazadeh"" - literally ""noble-born"" in Farsi but also a derogatory term used to describe their perceived extravagance.
High-profile clerics have also been targeted.
Mohammad Naghi Lotfi, who held the prestigious position of leading Friday prayers at a mosque in Ilam, west Iran, resigned in October after he was criticized on social media for being photographed stepping out of a luxury sports utility vehicle.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) posts labeled Lotfi a hypocrite for highlighting ways that ordinary Iranians could get through the economic crisis during his speeches. The outcry was a major factor in his decision to resign from a post he had held for 18 years.
""The hype that was presented against me in this position ... made me resign, lest in the creation of this hype the position of the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution be damaged,"" Lotfi told state media after stepping down.
""The issue of the vehicle ... was all lies that they created in cyberspace,"" he added.

He was one of at least four clerics in charge of Friday prayers who have resigned in the last year after being accused on social media of profligacy or financial impropriety.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Japan should avoid aggravating historical tensions in a diplomatic row over South Koreans forced to work for Japanese firms during World War Two, South Korea's foreign ministry has warned.
South Korea's top court ruled last month that Japan's Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp (T:5401) must compensate four South Koreans for their forced labor during the war, which Japan has denounced as ""unthinkable."" 
The binding court verdict is straining relations between the neighbors and could affect bilateral efforts to rein in North Korea's nuclear program, analysts say. 
Japan and South Korea share a bitter history that includes Japan's 1910-45 colonization of the Korean peninsula and the use of comfort women, Japan's euphemism for girls and women, many of them Korean, forced to work in its wartime brothels. 
Japan's Foreign Minister Taro Kono said in a Bloomberg interview on Sunday that ""it would be difficult for any country to do anything with the South Korean government"" if a court can reverse Seoul's agreements made under international law. 
Kono's remarks threatened to add fuel to the controversy, South Korea's foreign ministry said late on Tuesday. 
""South Korea is very concerned that Japan's leaders in positions of responsibility are disregarding the root cause of the issue...and continue to make comments that rouse our public's emotions,"" the ministry said in a statement.
""The Japanese government must be clearly aware that excessive political emphasis on the present case will be of no help to the future-oriented relationship between South Korea and Japan,"" the ministry added. 
The row was triggered by a Supreme Court ruling that Nippon Steel pay 100 million won ($87,700) to each of the four steel workers who sought compensation and unpaid wages, saying that their rights to reparation was not terminated by a 1965 treaty.
Japan says the issue had been resolved ""completely and finally"" by the 1965 agreement.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said on Wednesday South Korea was in violation of international law after the Supreme Court issued its verdict, and Seoul should take steps to redress the situation immediately. 
""We are watching to see what concrete steps the South Korean government will take,"" Suga said. 
A senior official in South Korea's presidential office said on Wednesday the government needed time and Japan's latest comments were not helpful.
""There has been a ruling by the judiciary that differs from the previous government stance, so we have to arrange our stance,"" said the official, who declined to be named.
""This takes time, and the Japanese government overly criticizing our government does not help resolve the situation,"" the official added. 
South Korea says there were nearly 150,000 victims of wartime forced labor, 5,000 of whom are alive. Japan says the compensation issue was settled by the 1965 treaty normalizing ties.

In December, a South Korean appeals court is expected to rule on a similar case of compensation claims against Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (T:7011).

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's nuclear regulator approved an extension of operations for a 40-year-old reactor near Tokyo that has the same basic design as those that melted down in the Fukushima crisis nearly eight years ago, a move that is likely to be controversial. 
The reactor, Tokai Daini, is the first boiling water reactor (BWR) to be approved for a lifetime extension of 20 years. The approval will be a boost for operator, Japan Atomic Power Co, which is owned by the country's main utilities and is bleeding cash because of the shutdown of its two nuclear power units. 
Japan's Nuclear Regulation Authority approved the extension at a meeting of its commissioners on Wednesday, it said. 
Japan Atomic must complete safety upgrades, and a company spokesman told Reuters the nuclear operator will build a tsunami protection wall to fortify Tokai Daini. A restart of the plant is not expected till the 2020s. 
Japan Atomic will also need the approval of local and prefectural authorities before it can resume operations. 
Tokai Daini was operating when a massive earthquake struck off the northeast coast of Japan on March 11, 2011, creating a tsunami that swamped Tokyo Electric Power's Fukushima Daichi plant to the north, causing explosions and meltdowns at three reactors. 
The Tokai Daini plant sustained damage, but shut down automatically, according to Japan Atomic. 
While the extension will be a further boost for Japan's resurgent nuclear industry, the sector will still miss a government target of providing at least a fifth of the country's electricity by 2030, an analysis by Reuters showed last week. 
Nuclear power remains an unpopular energy option in Japan and the country will reboot only a fraction of the 54 reactors it had before the 2011 disaster. 
Six reactors at Fukushima Daiichi are being dismantled in a decades-long exercise that is fraught with technological challenges and hampered by radioactive waste. Operators have also decided to decommission a further 10 units across the country since Fukushima. 
Nine reactors have restarted, all of them pressurized water reactors located far from Tokyo, while the stigma of Fukushima still hangs over use of the older BWR technology.

LONDON (Reuters) - Prince Charles, the ""rebel"" heir to the British throne, will face a battle to win over Britons and could even put the monarchy at risk if he does not temper his strong views when he eventually becomes king, a royal biographer says.
Charles, who turns 70 next week, will be the oldest monarch to be crowned when he finally succeeds his 92-year-old mother Queen Elizabeth.
Tom Bower, whose unauthorized ""Rebel Prince"" biography of Charles was published earlier this year, said the prince was intelligent, kind and sensitive but also selfish, ungrateful, and a lover of luxury whose stubborn streak could risk the institution itself.
""I think Charles will try his hardest to be a good king,"" Bower, who describes himself as a committed monarchist, told Reuters. ""The question will be how he behaves, whether he abandons a lot of the qualities that were shown in the preceding 20, 30 years.
""I do believe the queen and (her husband) Prince Philip have been thankful to live so long to prevent their son being the monarch because he would have jeopardized it."" 
Such critical portraits of the prince are not new. Since the public breakdown of his marriage to Princess Diana in the 1990s, his lifestyle and views on issues such as climate change, religion, alternative medicine and architecture have often had unfavorable treatment.
""As a teenager, I remember feeling deeply about this appallingly excessive demolition job being done on every aspect of life,"" Charles said in a written response to Vanity Fair magazine for an interview published this month.
""In putting my head above the parapet on all these issues, and trying to remind people of their long-term, timeless relevance to our human experience - never mind trying to do something about them - I found myself in conflict with the conventional outlook which, as I discovered, is not exactly the most pleasant situation to find yourself."" 
Bower, whose biography was based on interviews with 120 people including some who worked closely for the royals, said the prince was committed to issues like the environment but was someone unable to take criticism.
""He's very keen to criticize others but cannot tolerate those who challenge him,"" Bower said. 
""He's a person who is driven, who undoubtedly wants to do good but doesn't understand that the consequences of a lot of his actions cause a lot of trouble and he doesn't like to be told that he might be doing something wrong.""
Former aides who have worked closely with Charles say many of the stories in Bower's book are simply not true. The prince himself has dismissed a story that he travels with his own toilet seat. 
""I can understand why critics will write ... negatively, but all they're doing is taking a facet of him and making it the most negative possible,"" one former close aide of many years, who described himself as a big fan of Charles, told Reuters.
""It's not such a contradiction that people have these polar views of him because somewhere in the middle is the real man.""
AXES TO GRIND
Supporters of the prince say his detractors are often those with axes to grind airing exaggerated grievances.
""That reflects on Charles for causing those people to have a grievance,"" Bower said. ""You don't find people speaking with grievances against the queen."" 
While the queen was a unifier, he said: ""Charles does the opposite. He divides the nation between those who like him and dislike him, he divides his own court, he creates hostility when he be creating harmony and that's his trait."" 
Bower said Charles had rebelled against his parents, saying the demise of his relationship with Diana and the romance with his second wife Camilla was part of that rebellion. 
""He has a view of the world and he wants to impose his view of that world, so in every way he doesn't want to conform to expectations, so that makes him a rebel,"" he said.

""I think that if he's a rebel king, the monarchy will be in danger and I think that is the great problem we face.""

1605,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2018 09:10PM ET</span>",Australia's far-right One Nation recruits former Labor leader,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - A former leader of Australia's main opposition Labor party said on Wednesday he will join the country's most prominent far-right political party, One Nation, in a move that may re-energize nationalist politics.
Mark Latham, who led Australia's center-left Labor to defeat at the 2004 national election, said he will join Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party, and will run as a candidate in the New South Wales (NSW) state election due early next year.
""Labor and the coalition (government) have got the same policies,"" Latham told Australia's Channel 9 television. ""It's important to give people a third choice.""
Latham's move is a boost to right-wing politics in Australia, a movement that has failed at the ballot box in recent years.
Hanson's One Nation briefly enjoyed the balance of power in Australia's upper house Senate in 2016 though the party split with the resignation of several lawmakers.
One Nation has traditionally enjoyed strong support in Australia's northeast, but saw support wane at last year's state election in Hanson's home state of Queensland. It also flopped at the 2017 Western Australia state election.
Latham - who in early 2004 looked on course to become Australian prime minister - is a likely boost to the movement.
""Latham will get a lot of attention. He has signaled he will campaign on the issue of immigration, which will resonate with voters,"" said Peter Chen, professor of politics at the University of Sydney.
Immigration is expected to be a centerpiece of the NSW state election and the next national ballot, amid growing voter frustration at urban congestion and soaring house prices.
Nearly 70 percent of the 186,000 migrants who settled in Australia last year all moved to Sydney or Melbourne, according to government data.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison must call a national election by May 2019, with Labor predicted to win a landslide victory according to opinion polls.
His conservative government lost its parliamentary majority on Monday, when an independent candidate was confirmed the winner in a critical by-election in Sydney, and now relies on six independents to stay in power.

1606,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2018 08:23PM ET</span>",'Invasion' or 'brother migrants'? Caravans threaten Mexico-U.S. detente,"By Dave Graham
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A stream of U.S.-bound Central American migrant caravans risks clouding the rapprochement between Mexico's next leader and U.S. President Donald Trump, who has railed against illegal migration to energize his electoral base.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a combative leftist who takes office in December, has signaled he hopes to repair bilateral ties damaged by Trump's criticism of Mexico for failing to stop migration and his demands for a border wall.
From opposite sides of the political spectrum, he and Trump have so far defied fears they could clash, with both helping to find common ground for a new North American trade deal. 
But a spate of Central American migrant caravans pushing into Mexico in recent weeks revived tensions in the run-up to U.S. congressional elections on Tuesday. Trump has threatened to close the U.S-Mexico border if the migrants are not stopped.
""This is one of the potential flashpoints that could end the bromance between Lopez Obrador and Trump,"" Arturo Sarukhan, a former Mexican ambassador to the United States, told Reuters.
Trump's 2016 election win sent relations between the two neighbors to their lowest ebb in years.
During the campaign, he repeatedly vowed to make Mexico pay for a border wall to keep out migrants, and accused the country of sending rapists and drug runners north.
Tensions over migration spilled over into economic affairs.
Trump tried to use border security to extract concessions in the revamp of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which he threatened to scrap before the United States, Mexico and Canada agreed a new deal on Sept. 30.
Mexico sends 80 percent of its exports to the United States and the NAFTA renegotiation rattled Mexico's financial markets and disrupted investment.
Since a convoy of Hondurans left the city of San Pedro Sula on Oct. 13, several thousand Central Americans have crossed into Mexico. Trump has said he will send troops to the U.S. southern border to stop what he calls an ""invasion.""
Lopez Obrador, by contrast, has been offering to help his ""brother migrants"" with visas and employment. He wants to persuade Trump to contribute to a plan to promote development in Central America and Mexico's poorer south.
However, Sarukhan said Trump would almost certainly continue to campaign divisively on border security and migration as the race for the 2020 U.S. presidential election heats up.
""It's hard for me to see, given the current dynamics in the United States, how Lopez Obrador is going to either ensure that this doesn't become a flashpoint or convince Trump to spend significant political, diplomatic and financial capital in holistic development in Central America,"" he said.
Angered by the caravans, Trump has threatened to cut aid to Central America - the very opposite of what the region needs, said Hector Vasconcelos, a lawmaker for Lopez Obrador's MORENA party, and head of the Senate foreign relations committee. 
""We need big economic development programs in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador if we really want to reduce migration from those countries,"" Vasconcelos said.
Most of the migrants say they are fleeing gang violence and poverty. But Trump suggested, without providing proof, the caravans could be hiding ""Middle Eastern"" terrorists.
Asked how a Lopez Obrador administration would seek to bridge the differences over migration, incoming foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard told Reuters on Oct. 22 in Canada that, once in office, it hoped to start persuading the United States and others of the benefits of investing in Central America.
However, he added: ""It's not very easy.""
SHARP WORDS
Lopez Obrador has adopted a conciliatory tone toward Trump since winning Mexico's July election, stressing his desire for good relations.
Privately though, members of his transition team are skeptical whether the goodwill will last as the 2020 U.S. presidential election unfolds.
If Trump returns to the rhetoric he deployed against Mexico during his first election campaign, it could encourage the fiercely patriotic Lopez Obrador to hit back.
Just weeks after Trump took office in 2017, Lopez Obrador went to the United States to address Mexican-American voters, rounding on the new U.S. president in a speech in Los Angeles.

""These astute but irresponsible neo-fascist rulers want to build walls to turn the United States into an enormous ghetto, and put Mexicans in general, and our migrant compatriots in particular, on the same level as the Jews stigmatized and unjustly persecuted in the age of Hitler,"" Lopez Obrador said.

Maas told German newspaper Die Welt that Germany would continue to press both Washington and Moscow to adhere to the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, and said it made sense to include China in future agreements.
President Donald Trump on Oct. 20 announced plans to quit the INF Treaty, citing what he sees as Russian violations of the pact and concerns about China's development of new weapons since it was not party to the treaty. 
Maas said it was imperative to create a disarmament regime that included emerging weapons systems and China. 
""Space weapons and autonomous weapons will soon no longer be science fiction, but possible reality,"" he told the newspaper. ""We need rules that keep pace with the technological development of new weapons systems.""
Maas gave no details of his plans to visit China, but said he would use his discussions with Chinese officials in ""the next days to advocate for greater transparency and arms controls.""
He said Germany remained in close discussions with the United States and its partners in NATO about the INF Treaty and wants to prevent a new arms race.
NATO foreign ministers are due to discuss the issue in December.
Maas said he had also urged Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to stick to the INF Treaty and be transparent about its development of new weapons, something that had not occurred to date.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Thousands of mostly Honduran migrants traveling through Mexico gathered in the capital on Tuesday after a 1,000 mile (1,600 km) journey, with a handful saying President Donald Trump's hostility had deterred them from continuing to the United States.
Officials estimated 4,500 migrants were camped in a Mexico City sports stadium, dirty and exhausted after a journey through the violence-plagued state of Veracruz this week.
While most in the caravan are still planning to reach the United States, several in the crowd told Reuters they were now considering alternative destinations.
The caravan has incurred Trump's wrath ahead of Tuesday's U.S. congressional elections. As they try to hang on to control of Congress, Republican candidates have been following Trump's lead and using rhetoric about immigrants as a tactic to motivate voters.
Trump has ordered 7,000 troops to the border, while a commercial approved by his campaign that linked the caravan to crime was pulled by U.S. networks on Monday.
""Mexico,"" said Franklin Martinez, 46, a maintenance man from Intibuca, Honduras, when asked about his final destination. ""I'll stay here if they let me work.""
Like Martinez, five others at the stadium said they were now less sure about trying their luck in the United States. 
""Canada,"" said two Hondurans, Marel Santos, 18, and Alexander Chavez, 19, of their intended destination, citing Trump's angry response to the caravan.
The pair, who met in the caravan, stood waiting for food in a line that snaked around the stadium. Bedraggled men, women and children had bedded down in the sports arena on Monday night, bundled in blankets or donated sweaters to face the mountain capital's chill.
While many at the stadium were unaware of the U.S. congressional elections and their unwitting role in some campaigning, news spread to others by word of mouth and reports seen on phones. 
Martinez said he was rooting for a victory from the Democrats, who are seeking to wrest control of the House of Representatives and Senate from the Republicans.
""Here's hoping the Republicans lose,"" said Martinez, who said such a result could improve the political climate in the United States, and could convince him to restart his trek north.
""The Republicans are very anti-immigrant, the majority of them.""
""WE FEEL GOOD"" 
Their arrival in the Mexican capital was a measure of the migrants' tenacity despite attempts by four governments - Honduras, Guatemala, Mexico and the United States - to break them up. 
Mexico City's human rights ombudsman said some 4,500 migrants had arrived at the stadium by Tuesday morning, although around 6,500 have left the caravan and returned home to Honduras, according to Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez.
To have made it to the capital was ""a success,"" said Arnold Gomez, 30, a security guard from Honduras. ""It's a city many of us hoped to see ... We feel good. Good, good.""
Since it set off from one of the world's most violent cities, San Pedro Sula, Honduras, on Oct. 13, the caravan has met intermittent police resistance at the Honduran border with Guatemala, on a bridge connecting Guatemala to Mexico, and at the crossing point between the southern Mexican states of Chiapas and Oaxaca.
Over the weekend, an offer of transport from local authorities in the town of Sayula, Veracruz, was revoked at the last minute, leaving migrants forced to hitch-hike onward through drug-cartel territory, according to migrants and witnesses from nonprofit organizations that Reuters spoke to.
Some former members of the caravan said they were deported back to Honduras after it fragmented into smaller groups in southern Mexico.
""It's the end of my American dream,"" said Dimas Alexander, 33, a construction worker, speaking by telephone from his home in La Ceiba, Honduras. 
He said Mexican immigration authorities had stopped him, along with about 150 others, on Saturday morning aboard two truck trailers headed to Mexico City.
Mexico's interior ministry denied the government was deporting caravan members. It said 478 of them had voluntarily agreed to return home.

ANTANANARIVO (Reuters) - Millions of people in Madagascar vote on Wednesday in a presidential election in which three leading politicians vie to run a country struggling to create jobs, fight poverty and end corruption.
President Hery Rajaonarimampianina is seeking a second term in office and his two main challengers are former heads of state: Marc Ravalomanana and Andry Rajoelina.
All three have criss-crossed the island in the Indian Ocean in a hunt for votes and each has pledged to accelerate recovery for an economy the International Monetary Fund forecasts will grow at more than 5 percent this year, its highest rate in a decade.
Civil society groups accuse the three wealthy front-runners of enriching themselves in office, something each denies.
The groups say a fisheries deal the incumbent signed with Chinese firms in September is opaque and will impoverish local fishermen.
They also said Ravalomanana failed to tackle corruption during his time in office that ended in 2009 when he was forced out by protests led by Rajoelina in what international organizations like the African Union said was a coup.
Conservation groups then accused Rajoelina, the man who ousted him, of profiting from the plunder of natural resources. 
There are nearly 10 million registered voters in the country of 25 million people, data from the electoral commission showed. 
Few analysts expect an outright winner from the 36 total who will contest and the top two candidates would contest a run-off slated for Dec. 19.
Since a peaceful election in 2013, investors and donor governments re-engaged following a four-year freeze that began after Rajoelina came to power.
The events of 2009 prompted an exodus of foreign investors from a country that is one of the world's poorest despite reserves of nickel, cobalt, gold, uranium and other minerals.
The island was hit by a fresh political crisis in April sparked by a legal amendment by Rajaonarimampianina's government that would have prevented Ravalomanana from standing for office.

Rajaonarimampianina approved a new law removing that provision the following month, allowing Ravalomanana to register as a candidate.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department said on Tuesday it would impose additional sanctions on Russia after Moscow failed to give reasonable assurances it would not use chemical weapons after a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy in England.
The department in August had threatened Russia with added sanctions after 90 days unless it complied with the 1991 Chemical and Biological Weapons and Warfare Elimination Act.
Under the law, Russia had to end the use of the nerve agent Novichok, which was used in the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in March, commit to not using chemical weapons against its own people, and allow on-site inspections by agencies like the United Nations.
""Today, the department informed Congress we could not certify that the Russian Federation met the conditions,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement.
""We intend to proceed in accordance with the terms of the CBW Act, which directs the implementation of additional sanctions,"" she added.
Skripal, a former colonel in Russia's GRU military intelligence service, and his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia, were found slumped unconscious on a bench in the southern English city of Salisbury in March after a liquid form of Novichok was applied to his home's front door. Both survived the attack.
European countries and the United States expelled 100 Russian diplomats after the attack, in the strongest action by President Donald Trump against Russia since he came to office.
Moscow has repeatedly denied any involvement in the attack.
An initial round of sanctions in August related to the Skripal poisoning targeted Russian national-security controlled goods. The second round of sanctions would be ""more draconian,"" the State Department said at the time.
The State Department did not say when the next batch of sanctions against Russia would be issued.
Republican House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce said he was not surprised that Russia had not complied with the chemical weapons law and pressed the administration to move on the next round of penalties. 
""No one should be surprised that (Russian President) Vladimir Putin refuses to swear off future use of weapons-grade nerve agents,"" Royce said. ""It is unacceptable that the administration lacks a plan – or even a timeline - for action on the second round of mandatory sanctions required by U.S. law,"" he added.

A Kremlin spokesman said on Tuesday that Putin and Trump will meet briefly in Paris next week, and U.S. officials said such a meeting was likely.

Le Monde also said police had raided Rybolovlev's luxury residence La Belle Epoque in Monaco. 
A Monaco judge has for over a year been investigating whether Rybolovlev sought to influence Monaco law enforcement officials in his long-running dispute with Swiss art dealer Yves Bouvier.
The Russian alleges Bouvier swindled him out of $1 billion by overcharging him on 38 pieces of art he purchased over a 10-year period and is suing his former art adviser in Monaco, Singapore and Switzerland. Bouvier has denied wrongdoing. 
The Monaco prosecutor confirmed to Reuters an operation linked to the investigation but declined to say if Rybolovlev was being questioned by police.
Asked about the Le Monde report, Rybolovlev's lawyers in Russia declined to comment on whether he was being questioned and said: ""We request that the presumption of innocence in relation to Mr Rybolovlev is strictly respected.""
All those involved have denied wrongdoing.
The Russian businessman, who earned his multi-billion-dollar fortune through the sale of two Russian fertilizer producers, bought U.S. President Donald Trump's Palm Beach mansion in 2008 for about $100 million. 
The questioning of an individual under investigation is a standard procedure. Being under investigation in Monaco is not equivalent to being charged. It is the first step in an investigation.
The feud between Rybolovlev and Bouvier led to the resignation in September of the head of Monaco’s judicial services after Le Monde daily wrote about connections between Rybolovlev and Monegasque justice officials.
Rybolovlev spent more than $2 billion buying 38 masterpieces from Bouvier between 2003 and 2014.
In 2017, Rybolovlev sold Leonardo da Vinci's portrait of Christ ""Salvator Mundi"" for $450 million at a Christie’s auction, making it the most expensive painting ever sold.

Ryboloblev has also sued Sotheby's for $380 million, alleging the auction house helped Bouvier defraud him. Sotheby's has described the allegation as ""desperate"" and without merit.

The Greek Orthodox Church has played a leading role in the life of the country for many centuries and is considered its official religion under the constitution. For many Greeks, their national identity is intricately bound up with their religion.
Under the deal, reached between Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and Archbishop Ieronymos of the Church of Greece, the state will in the future transfer an annual state subsidy to a special church fund for the payment of priests' salaries.
The agreement also foresees a settlement to a decades-old dispute over property between the Greek state and the Church, which is one of the country's largest real estate owners. 
Greece's creditors have long urged the government to sell assets and reduce the number of public sector employees. Under the current system, priests' salaries are paid directly from the state budget as are those of all civil servants.
The annual cost of the priests on the government's payroll is estimated at about 200 million euros.
Tuesday's agreement must still be approved by the cabinet, parliament and church leaders.
A group representing priests said they would resist any attempt to strip them of their status as civil servants.
""We will struggle to ensure the present status is maintained,"" Father Georgios Sellis, head of the association of Greek priests, told the Proto Thema news website.
Tuesday's preliminary agreement coincides with parliamentary discussions on a revision of Greece's constitution.

Tsipras said he had reassured the Archbishop that any constitutional changes would protect the autonomy of the Church.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. diplomat has granted an exception to certain U.S. sanctions that will allow the India-led development of a port in Iran as part of a new transportation corridor designed to boost Afghanistan's economy, a State Department spokesman said on Tuesday.
The exception granted by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to U.S. sanctions reimposed on Iran on Monday also will permit the construction of a railway line from Chabahar port to Afghanistan, and for shipments to the war-torn country of non-sanctionable goods, like food and medicines, the spokesman said.
In addition, Afghanistan will be allowed to continue importing Iranian petroleum products, the spokesman said.
""These activities are vital for the ongoing support of Afghanistan's growth and humanitarian relief,"" the spokesman said in a statement emailed to Reuters.
The sanctions reimposed on Iran's oil exports - its main revenue source - and financial sector were triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump's May 8 decision to abandon the 2015 international deal designed to block Tehran's development of nuclear weapons.
Trump denounced the deal, which lifted sanctions on Iran in return for limits on its nuclear program. He argued that it would not prevent Tehran from developing weapons and failed to address other activities, such as its ballistic missile program and support for extremist groups. 
The sanctions, however, threatened India's ability to obtain financing for the development of Chabahar, which could potentially open the way for millions of dollars of trade for land-locked Afghanistan and end its dependence on Pakistan's port of Karachi.
Building Afghanistan's economy also could reduce Kabul's dependence on foreign aid and put a major dent in the illicit opium trade, the main revenue source of the Taliban insurgency.

The sanctions exception granted to the Chabahar project aims to further U.S. ties with Afghanistan and India ""as we execute a policy of maximum pressure to change the Iranian regime's destabilizing policies in the region and beyond,"" the State Department spokesman said.

Cesar Sayoc was arrested on Oct. 26 in Fort Lauderdale and agreed in a Florida court appearance last week to be transferred to New York to face five criminal charges.
Sayoc, a former stripper and pizza delivery driver who lived in a white van festooned with right-wing political images supporting Trump and attacking his critics, was arrested following an intense manhunt.
Dressed in a navy blue prison overalls with his gray hair pulled back and knotted at the back of his head, Sayoc appeared respectful and alert in court.
When U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert Lehrburger asked him if he understood his rights as explained to him, Sayoc responded: ""Yes, sir, a hundred percent.""
Prosecutors had argued before the hearing that Sayoc was too dangerous to be released on bail. But Sayoc's attorney, federal defender Sarah Baumgartel, told the hearing he would not make an application for bail at this point. 
A preliminary hearing in the case was set for Nov. 12.
The mailed bombs and the separate massacre of 11 Jews at a Pittsburgh synagogue in late October heightened tensions days ahead of Tuesday's elections, which will determine the balance of power in the U.S. Congress currently controlled by Trump's Republican Party. 
Prosecutors have accused Sayoc of sending 16 improvised explosive devices. None of the devices exploded before being intercepted and no one was hurt.
The first bomb discovered was sent to billionaire investor George Soros at his home in New York's Westchester County, and some of the other high-profile targets also live in New York state, including former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
Other targets of the improvised explosive devices included former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Joe Biden, among others.
Sayoc faces a maximum 48 years in prison if convicted on the five counts he now faces, including for mailing explosives and threatening the Clintons.
Prosecutors have said Sayoc is likely to face additional charges and penalties from their ongoing investigation.

In a letter to ABC News Sayoc's mother, Madeline Sayoc, wrote that she had unsuccessfully tried to get him treatment for what she said was long-standing mental illness.

The case of Asia Bibi, who spent eight years on death row in Pakistan before being released, has outraged Christians worldwide. Bibi's husband, Ashiq Masih, has appealed for help to Britain, Canada, Italy and the United States, and so far, Italy has said it would assist her. (https://reut.rs/2qyeBXk)
""It's a very important issue, a central priority for our government,"" Canada's foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, said of Bibi's case after meeting her European Union counterpart, Federica Mogherini, in Montreal.
Bibi was convicted of blasphemy in 2010 after neighbors said she made derogatory remarks about Islam when they objected to her drinking water from their glass because she was not Muslim. She is a Protestant and denies committing blasphemy.
""Canada calls on Pakistan to take all measures necessary to ensure the safety and security of Asia Bibi and her family,"" Freeland said. ""Canada is prepared to do everything we can"" and is ""extremely engaged in this issue,"" Freeland said. 
Islamists shut down roads in major cities in Pakistan during three days of demonstrations against Bibi's acquittal. They have threatened to escalate the protests if she is permitted to leave the country. The government has indicated it will bar her from traveling abroad.
Bibi's lawyer, Saiful Mulook, fled to the Netherlands earlier this week because of fears for the safety of his family.

More than 700,000 Rohingya refugees crossed into Bangladesh from western Myanmar, U.N. agencies say, after Rohingya insurgent attacks on Myanmar security forces in August 2017 triggered a sweeping military crackdown.
The two countries agreed on Oct. 30 to begin the returns to Myanmar in mid-November. The U.N. refugee agency has already said that conditions in Rakhine state were ""not yet conducive for returns"".
Yanghee Lee, U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, said in a statement that she had received credible information from the refugees in Cox’s Bazar that ""they are in deep fear of their names being on the list to be repatriated, causing distress and anguish"".
She had not seen any evidence of the government of Myanmar creating an environment where the Rohingya can return to their place of origin and live in safety with their rights guaranteed.
It has ""failed to provide guarantees they would not suffer the same persecution and horrific violence all over again,"" Lee said.
The root causes of the crisis must first be dealt with, including the right to citizenship and freedom of movement, she said.

Myanmar does not consider the Rohingya a native ethnic group. Many in the Buddhist-majority country call the Rohingya ""Bengalis"", suggesting they belong in Bangladesh.

1619,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>",Kavanaugh in focus as U.S. high court weighs death case,"By Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Conservative new U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on Tuesday joined liberal colleagues in raising concerns about Missouri's plan to use lethal injection to execute a murderer with a rare medical condition.
Lawyers for Russell Bucklew, 50, have argued that because of a congenital condition called cavernous hemangioma that leaves him with blood-filled tumors on his body, the lethal injection could cause undue agony in violation of the U.S. Constitution's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.
Based on the one-hour oral argument, it is not clear how the court will rule in Bucklew's case but Kavanaugh's comments in his first death penalty-related oral argument since joining the court last month suggest he could potentially break with fellow conservatives. 
If he joins the court's four liberals, the court could issue a narrow decision sending the case back to lower courts to determine whether the state can accommodate Bucklew's medical issues.
Kavanaugh, a conservative appeals court judge, was appointed by President Donald Trump and joined the court last month after a fierce Senate confirmation battle.
During the argument he appeared to question Supreme Court precedent that requires inmates to come up with an alternative method of execution if they think the state's preferred method is too painful.
""So you're saying that even if the method imposes gruesome, brutal pain, you can still go forward?"" Kavanaugh asked the state's lawyer, John Sauer. ""Is there any limit on that?""
His comments seemed to address two previous rulings in which the court has declined to invalidate lethal injection procedures but said inmates can propose less painful alternatives.
In Missouri, execution is authorized using either injection or gas but the state in practice uses only lethal injection. Bucklew, whose appeal is neither contesting his guilt nor seeking to avoid execution, has suggested being put to death by gas. Lawyers for the state say that although lethal gas is authorized, it has never been used and there are no protocols for it.
The high court on March 20 blocked Bucklew's execution on a 5-4 vote, with four of the court's five conservative justices voting to deny the request. The conservative justice who voted with the court's four liberals to grant the stay, Anthony Kennedy, has since retired and was replaced by Kavanaugh.
Bucklew was convicted of the 1996 murder in southeastern Missouri of Michael Sanders, who was living with Bucklew's former girlfriend Stephanie Ray at the time. Bucklew fatally shot Sanders at his trailer home, kidnapped and raped Ray, shot at Sanders' 6-year-old son and wounded a police officer before being apprehended, according to court papers.
Bucklew's condition has caused large, blood-filled tumors to grow on his face, head, neck and throat, according to court papers.

A ruling is due by the end of June.

Mahmut Togrul, a member the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP)representing the southeastern province of Gaziantep, was found guilty of spreading propaganda for the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) at two separate speeches in 2016.
His lawyers have said that Togrul's remarks did not include any criminal elements and were within the framework of freedom of expression, the state-owned Anadolu news agency said.
Erdogan and his AK Party say the HDP has links to the PKK, a militant group that has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984. The HDP denies any direct links to the PKK and says it is being unjustly targeted by the government.
The HDP has previously said that as many as 5,000 of its members had been detained, the majority of whom were targeted as part of a widespread crackdown following an abortive putsch in July 2016.
Sixteen members of the HDP, including Togrul, have been sentenced to prison, the official said, most on terrorism charges. Of those, 10 are still in prison, the official said.
Selahattin Demirtas, the former head of the HDP and one of Turkey's best-known politicians, was also sentenced to jail last month, after nearly two years in prison.
Demirtas ran against Erdogan in the June presidential elections, carrying out his campaign from behind prison bars.
The HDP remains the second-largest opposition party in Turkey's 600-member parliament, after the secular Republican People's Party (CHP). Erdogan's ruling AK Party and their nationalist MHPallies hold the majority.

The move could help Washington repair strained ties with NATO ally Ankara.
Turkey has been infuriated by U.S. support for the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia in the fight against Islamic State in Syria. Ankara considers the YPG an extension of the outlawed PKK and, like it, a terrorist organization.
On Tuesday, Washington authorized rewards of up to $5 million for information ""leading to the identification or location"" of Murat Karayilan, up to $4 million for Cemil Bayik and up to $3 million for Duran Kalkan.
The announcement was made by the U.S. Embassy in Ankara following a visit by U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Palmer.
The three PKK figures also appear on Turkey's ""most wanted terrorists"" list, according to the Interior Ministry, which describes them as being among the leaders of the organization.
The PKK, designated a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union, has fought the Turkish state since 1984.
Relations between Turkey and the United States have begun to thaw since the release from jail last month of American evangelical pastor Andrew Brunson.
Last week, the two countries mutually lifted sanctions on government officials, imposed in August over the Brunson case. Washington announced this week that Turkey would receive a temporary waiver from reimposed sanctions on Iran.
President Tayyip Erdogan also said on Tuesday that talks with the United States regarding state-owned lender Halkbank, which had been facing a U.S. fine over allegations of evasion of sanctions on Iran, were on a positive track.
U.S. and Turkish troops last week began conducting joint patrols in Syria's Manbij, which the two sides have agreed to clear of militants. Turkey had previously said the United States was delaying implementation of the plan.
Trump and Erdogan are to meet this weekend at a summit in Paris.

The residents fled rural areas in Hacari municipality, in Norte de Santander (MC:SAN) province along the border with Venezuela. Mass displacements continue to occur regularly in Colombia, despite a 2016 peace deal with the largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
The National Liberation Army (ELN) and the gang, known as Los Pelusos, have been fighting in the area since March, Hacari mayor Milciades Pinzon told local Caracol Radio, but combat intensified during the past week.
""People left Friday, fleeing from recent combat between the two groups. They didn't find any other way to save their lives except coming to the municipal capital,"" Pinzon said.
Coca - the base ingredient in cocaine - is grown in the area and the country's porous border with Venezuela is a well-known drug smuggling corridor.
Though thousands of FARC fighters demobilized last year and the group has now become a political party, lucrative drug trafficking and illegal mining areas abandoned by the group have become the focus of fierce fighting between the ELN, crime gangs and FARC dissidents who refused to lay down arms.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's main public sector union said it would go ahead with a planned general strike on Wednesday that would shut down airports, banks and all government offices, in protest over what it says is state inaction over construction site deaths.
The strike, due to start at 6 a.m. (0400 GMT), is meant to be indefinite, but it is likely to last no more than a day since the courts typically order workers back to work and both sides back to the negotiation table.
""We are witnessing more and more casualties every day, new casualties and serious safety incidents that could have been prevented,"" Histadrut chief Avi Nissenkorn said on Tuesday.
""If no solution is found in the coming hours, the economy will be hit by a general strike tomorrow.""
A Histadrut spokesman said its representatives were meeting officials from the Finance Ministry and other ministries in a last-ditch effort to avert a strike.
Asked about the situation, a Finance Ministry spokeswoman said: ""We are in negotiations. We believe it will be resolved tonight.""
The Histadrut labor federation has demanded the government adopt European construction standards, beef up safety measures and enforce a law on wearing safety harnesses. 
It wants the government to spend an additional 20 million shekels ($5.4 million) on hiring more safety inspectors.
The Finance Ministry says it places a high importance on improving work safety at construction sites and says it is working with the Labour Ministry to implement measures.
Last week the federation threatened strike action if its demands were not met. It said Israeli polling firm Smith had found 66 percent of Israelis supported any strike action.
Among those that would be affected are Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport and Ovda Airport near Eilat, as well as the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, Bank of Israel, commercial banks and trains.
The Histadrut says about 40 workers have died on building sites so far in 2018 and 200 others have been seriously injured.
Labour activists say 35 people died in 2017 and the Haaretz newspaper said the number of such deaths in previous years had averaged around 30.

On Tuesday the Histadrut held demonstrations at some 20 main intersections across Israel.

Caretaker Tourism Minister Avedis Guidanian, in the interview published on Monday by Lebanon's English-language Daily Star, complained that negative media reports about Lebanon were harming his country's image and hindering tourism.
""Look at Egypt - is there a place dirtier than it? People are louder than us, there is more traffic than here - people live in graves, OK? But there is tourism, because they know how to sell the country,"" Guidanian said. 
Late on Monday Guidanian apologized for his remarks and visited the Egyptian ambassador to Lebanon on Tuesday, NNA said. 
In Egypt, pro-government TV talk show host Ahmed Moussa said he ""does not care for his apology"", but stressed the good relations between the people of Egypt and Lebanon. Moussa dismissed the minister as a ""fool"" and said the Lebanese government should ""intervene"".
An official diplomatic source said the minister's statement in the newspaper ""does not reflect the position of Lebanon as a country or government, nor the Lebanese people"".
""The Lebanese people come to Egypt for tourism in large numbers,"" the source added.
A Lebanese tourist in Egypt was sentenced in July to eight years in prison after authorities said she had insulted the country in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) video post. The tourist, Mona el-Mazboh, had made a series of complaints including of sexual harassment. Her sentence was reduced in September to one year and suspended, and she left Egypt.

The aim is to build a force strong enough to show the Taliban that it is ""pointless and counterproductive to continue the fighting"", Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said during a visit to Kabul, where he met President Ashraf Ghani and senior NATO commanders.
""So there is a close link between our military efforts and our political efforts, a link between the strength of the Afghan security forces and the likelihood of progress in the peace process,"" he told Reuters.
Efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement to more than 17 years of war have intensified, with meetings between U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban officials aimed at preparing the way for peace talks.
""No one underestimates the scale of the challenge. And the situation remains serious,"" Stoltenberg said during a joint press conference with Ghani in the presidential palace.
Even as peace moves have picked up, Taliban insurgents have increased pressure across Afghanistan, where they now hold more territory than at any time since the U.S.-led campaign of 2001 that ousted them from power. 
At the same time, Afghan forces have been suffering their highest ever casualty levels, according to a report last week from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan, a U.S. Congressional watchdog. 
On Tuesday, hours before Stoltenberg met Ghani, Taliban fighters killed at least 20 Afghan soldiers at a security post in the western province of Farah.
NATO and its coalition partners have around 16,000 troops from 39 countries in Afghanistan, well down from over 100,000 at the height of the combat mission though higher than the 13,000 they had until the mission was beefed up last year.
Their main purpose is to train and advise Afghan army and police units as well as to provide a certain number of combat enabling services, including air support and intelligence.
Although the mission is no longer mainly a combat operation, the dangers of operating in Afghanistan have been underlined by a series of so-called ""insider attacks"" by rogue Afghan soldiers or police that have killed two NATO servicemen - an American and a Czech - in the past two weeks.
Stoltenberg said the threat of insider attacks and the high level of casualties suffered by Afghan forces was taken ""extremely seriously"" by NATO.
He had discussed the issue both with Ghani and the Resolute Support commander General Scott Miller, who himself narrowly escaped an insider attack in Kandahar last month, but it would not undermine the alliance's commitment to the mission.

""It has led to some temporary adjustments of the way we provide support in some areas but that's a temporary measure to address the immediate risks,"" Stoltenberg said.

Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, a former premier of Luxembourg, has long been a vocal supporter of the idea that the European Union should have more common defense capability, separate from the U.S.-dominated NATO military alliance.
The imminent departure from the bloc of Britain, long opposed to EU military collaboration, has revived discussion of defense cooperation -- as have concerns that President Donald Trump may be less willing than his predecessors to come to Europe's defense in the face of a newly assertive Russia.
Some EU leaders share Britain's view that giving the EU a big military role could undermine NATO. Traditionally neutral, non-NATO countries in the Union are also wary. However, most member states agreed last December to cooperate on funding and developing their armed forces.

""It cannot have an end-date. It must be applicable unless and until another solution is found,"" he said. 
The persistent differences over how to ensure maintaining an invisible Irish border have been the main hurdle to agreeing a Brexit deal in the unprecedented divorce negotiations to end more than four decades of Britain's membership in the EU. 
Uncertainty over whether the sides will be able to clinch a deal roiled sterling on Tuesday.

Barnier also said in separate comments to Belgian television RTBF that he was unable to declare at this stage that a deal was close.

1629,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2018 10:40AM ET</span>",Thousands of child soldiers still trapped after South Sudan war: U.N.,"By Tom Miles
GENEVA (Reuters) - Thousands of child soldiers dragged into South Sudan's civil war are unlikely to be freed soon because aid agencies lack the funds to look after them, a U.N. envoy said on Tuesday.
The government signed a peace deal with rebel factions in September to end a civil war that killed at least 50,000 people, but many children who were forced into the conflict are still stuck in military camps in the bush, Virginia Gamba, U.N. envoy for children and armed conflict, said.
Gamba, who has spoken to former child soldiers in the country, said a lack of resources to re-integrate the children meant they remained at extremely high risk of abuse.
Since January, 900 child soldiers have been freed and Gamba expects a further 1,000 releases by the end of the year. But there are many more, she told reporters.
""The first group of released children ... kept telling me that at least two or three of their friends were still in the bush waiting to be released or waiting to be negotiated and asking me to intervene on their behalf,"" she said. 
""We are talking of thousands still out there.""
U.N. funds for reintegrating children had halved over the past seven years while needs doubled, and aid workers could not cope with a sudden mass release, she said. 
""For every day that a kid is in the bush they will be revictimised, there’s just no question about it.""
After being abducted, children might be raped or sent to attack their own families to sever their ties to home. Escape attempts were punished by hand amputation or molten plastic poured onto the skin, Gamba said: ""They were terrified.""
Four-fifths of the violations were committed by the army, but all warring parties were guilty, Gamba said.
A South Sudan army spokesman declined to comment. 
Gamba said the number of violations of children's rights was greater than in Syria and Afghanistan.
""It is really huge, it’s quite gross. I mean, decapitation of children, the use of sexual violation against very small children as part of a weapon and a tactic of war to cow communities, the abduction of children, the recruitment of children, forced use of children in support of war efforts."" 
South Sudan has agreed a joint action plan with the United Nations that would allow aid workers to reach deep into the former war zone and verify child numbers in military camps.
Freed children - 40 percent of them girls - might get six months of help to learn a skill like carpentry or sewing so they could fend for themselves, but they would never go to school.

""These kids are condemned for the rest of their life ... their dreams will never be achieved,"" Gamba said.

PARIS (Reuters) - French police on Tuesday arrested five men and a woman, all from the radical far right, suspected of plotting to attack French President Emmanuel Macron, an official close to the investigation said.
The source said France's domestic spy agency (DGSI) ordered the raids in three different regions after obtaining intelligence that raised suspicion of an ""imprecise and loosely-formed"" plan for ""violent action"" against the president.
Police sources said the six were members of the radical far right in France. They were detained in swoops on addresses in the Isere region, southeast of Lyon, in Moselle on the border with Germany and Luxembourg, and in Ille-et-Vilaine near the city of Rennes in the country's northwest. 
It was not immediately clear what the connection between those arrested was.
In an interview published on Sunday, Macron warned of the threat from far-right movements across Europe, saying complacency during the 1930s was what had opened the way for the rise of Hitler in Germany and Mussolini in Italy.
In June, 10 people linked to France's radical far right were placed under formal investigation on suspicion of links to terrorist networks. 
A source close to the investigation said the 10 belonged to a hardline group whose stated intent was to ""fight against the threat of Islam"" and were suspected of planning an attack on Muslims. 
The June raids led to the seizure of ingredients for making explosives as well as guns and ammunition.
It was not clear if Tuesday's security operation was connected to the June arrests.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - As pollution levels surged to ""severe"" and ""hazardous"" levels in New Delhi this week, there was little sign that residents of India's teeming capital were doing much to protect themselves.
The smog, which is expected to worsen in the next few days, exposed people to as much as 24 times the recommended limits for dangerous particles on Monday. But unlike in many Chinese cities, where face masks are a common sight when smog levels spike, it is still rare to see locals taking measures to reduce their exposure.
Toddlers stand at school bus stops in crisply ironed uniforms, while security guards, street sweepers, and rickshaw drivers spend many hours outside breathing in filthy air - all without any attempt at protection.
Ask middle-class residents whether they have air purifiers in their homes and the answer is invariably no. 
This is despite the extensive coverage of the capital's pollution crisis by local media, including numerous warnings from doctors about massive health hazards, especially for children, the sick and the elderly.
The apparent lack of concern about the toxic air - whether through ignorance, apathy or the blinding impact of poverty -gives federal and local politicians the cover they need for failing to vigorously address the problem, said pollution activists, social scientists and political experts.
Neither the governing party at federal level nor the main opposition are in power in the capital, giving them little incentive to cooperate with the city authorities.
And while Delhi may have a population of more than 20 million, its importance at voting time - a national election is due by May next year - is insignificant in comparison with states such as neighboring Uttar Pradesh, which has 220 million.
""The tragedy is that there is no political will at all either on the part of the federal government or the state government of Delhi and, as a result, we can see both blaming each other for the crisis that we are in,"" said Yogendra Yadav, a political polling expert. ""Whatever little government action you get to see is because of the pressure that environmental activists and the Supreme Court get to exert.""
COCKTAIL OF FUMES
India's problems with smog extend far beyond Delhi - the nation of 1.3 billion has 14 out of the 15 most polluted cities in the world, according to the World Health Organisation.
But in the capital, at least, this was the year the problem was supposed to be addressed.
After a cocktail of toxic fumes enveloped the area in October and November last year, the Delhi city government declared it a public health emergency and its Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal described the Indian capital as a ""gas chamber"". Officials of the federal government said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's office had asked them to ensure that it did not happen again.
But steps taken so far have failed to make much difference, and now there is finger-pointing between Modi's administration, the Delhi city government, and the governments of states around the capital.
As this year's crisis has worsened, environment ministers from Punjab and Haryana - whose farmers' stubble-burning is a major contributor to the haze - failed to turn up for a meeting called by the federal environment ministry last week, sending their civil servants instead.
The farmers have been torching their fields as they get ready for new plantings, despite being offered government subsidies on machinery that would allow them to mulch the material into the ground without lighting fires.
Farmers say the subsidies were not enough to cover the price of the machinery, the cost of running it, and the additional labor needed, especially given higher fuel prices. 
India had planned to reduce crop burning by up to 70 percent this year but only a 30 percent drop has been visible so far, according to a government statement last Thursday.
Blaming that as the main reason behind New Delhi's poisonous air, a spokesman for the city government, said: ""We can't take steps in isolation in Delhi; we can't build a wall."" 
The federal government, meanwhile, has attacked the city for doing little to control pollution from dust, vehicles and industries. 
Certainly, there has been little done to reduce the number of heavily polluting vehicles on the roads in and around Delhi despite threats that have been made but not followed through, including one from the Supreme Court-appointed Environmental Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) to ban all private vehicles from the city.
And while the nation's top court has issued a ruling trying to restrict the use of fireworks on the night of the Hindu festival Diwali, which is on Wednesday, few expect it to be enforced. For one thing, the court's edict that only ""green"", less-polluting firecrackers can be let off between the hours of 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. is likely to be ignored because there are no ""green"" fireworks for sale in the city.
WAKE-UP CALL?
Most officials expect to wake up to even worse pollution on Nov. 8, as smoke from the festivities mixes with the smog from other sources to create a deadly cocktail. Light seasonal winds and a lack of rain at this time of year means pollution can linger for weeks, as it did last year.
But Modi's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is more concerned about the impact of weak farm incomes, high fuel prices, and whether job creation has been adequate as issues at the polls.
""A holistic approach in the current climate is difficult to envisage as political divisiveness means that politicians are not looking for enduring solutions,"" said Pavan K Varma, an official from a regional party in the state of Bihar and former diplomat who lives in Delhi.
Neither is it in the BJP's interests, or in the interest of the main opposition Congress party, to help Kejriwal's New Delhi government. In 2015, Kejriwal's anti-establishment Aam Aadmi (Common Man) Party, campaigning on an anti-corruption platform, crushed the BJP and Congress to take control of the city.
For Delhi's doctors it is a nightmare.
This year, the number of patients with severe lung problems has already gone up by up by 25 percent and is expected to increase further after Diwali, said Doctor Desh Deepak, a chest physician at government-run Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital. 
""It's tragic that children are suffering and we'll destroy a whole generation if we don't take cognizance of the fact that pollution needs to be tackled on a war footing,"" said Dr Neeraj Jain, head of chest medicine at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in Delhi. 
Dipankar Gupta, a leading sociologist who has written books on Indian society, said only heavy state intervention was likely to solve the problem. He pointed to an improvement in the pollution levels in Beijing last year because of strict government measures to curb polluting industries near the Chinese capital.
But that state crackdown still seems a long way from happening in India. The EPCA has announced a variety of steps between Nov. 1-10 as part of an emergency package, including the use of water sprinklers and a complete ban on construction. 
But most environmental experts say it is far too little, too late, and is not addressing the biggest pollution sources.
Modi has not publicly addressed the health crisis that has engulfed the capital.
The grim prognosis means that foreign organizations, including embassies in Delhi, are finding it difficult to get top talent to come to the city. 
""Staff with young children are increasingly choosing not to come which wasn't the case a few years ago,"" a Western diplomat told Reuters on condition of anonymity. 
Most of the city's residents are poor, however, and more worried about making enough money to buy food than pollution. 
""The daily grind ... leaves no room to think about the haze and smog,"" said Vimla Devi, who works as a maid in the suburbs of Delhi.

1632,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2018 09:50AM ET</span>",Cameroon leader tells separatists to down arms after kidnapping,"YAOUNDE (Reuters) - Cameroon's president on Tuesday warned Anglophone separatists to lay down their arms or face the full force of the law, a day after dozens of schoolchildren were abducted in the rebel region. 
Clashes between a secessionist movement and the army began more than a year ago in west Cameroon, killing over 400 civilians and forcing thousands to flee their homes. 
On Monday, unidentified assailants kidnapped 79 children, their principal and a driver from the PSS Nkwen school in Bamenda in Northwest region and took them into the bush outside town, military and government sources said.
An army spokesman blamed separatists for Monday's kidnapping. A separatist spokesman denied involvement and said government soldiers had carried it out, as a ploy to discredit the insurgents. 
President Paul Biya, making an inauguration speech after re-election last month that extends his 36-year-old rule, did not mention the kidnapping but attacked the separatists.
""They need to know that they will face the rigor of the law and the determination of our defense and security forces,"" Biya said in the national assembly.
""I appeal to them to lay down their arms.""
Last week, an American Baptist missionary was shot dead amid fighting between the army and separatists in Bamenda.
The secessionists have imposed curfews and closed schools as part of their rebellion against the French-speaking government, which they say has marginalized the Anglophone minority. 
Samuel Fonki, a minister of the Presbyterian Church in Cameroon, said he had been mediating with the kidnappers for the children's release. He said separatists were responsible. 
The search for the children continued on Tuesday. About 200 parents gathered outside the school, waiting to hear if their children were among those who had been abducted or had remained unharmed at the school. 
Authorities denied parents access to the school, according to six parents and a security guard who spoke to Reuters.
The kidnapping was a chilling echo of the 2014 abduction of the Chibok girls by Boko Haram in neighboring Nigeria. There are no known links between the Cameroon separatists and the Nigerian Islamist militant group.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain needs more time to figure out a solution on the post-Brexit Irish border and will not accept a deal at any cost from Brussels, Prime Minister Theresa May told her cabinet on Tuesday.
Up against a ticking clock to get a detailed plan in place before Britain leaves the EU in March, May is battling to find a way to meet the often contradictory demands from Brussels and rival factions within her own party.
The prospect of failure has financial markets on edge, with sterling traders watching for any signs of progress at a regular meeting between May and her senior ministers on Tuesday. 
But May told her cabinet that more time was needed to clear the final hurdle standing between her and a deal on the terms of Britain's withdrawal: the plan to ensure no hard border emerges between Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland after Brexit. 
""(May) said that while 95 percent of the withdrawal agreement had been concluded, on the Northern Ireland backstop there are a number of issues that we still need to work through and these are the most difficult,"" her spokesman told reporters.
Cabinet considered options put forward by May's attorney general on ways to give the EU an assurance that if talks on a permanent solution to the Irish border fail, a so-called backstop agreement would kick in.
The spokesman said: ""This includes ensuring that if the backstop is ever needed it is not permanent, and there is a mechanism to ensure the UK could not be held in the arrangement indefinitely.""
No decisions were taken at cabinet and more work needed to be done on the British side, he said.
That leaves only a slim chance that an agreement between British and EU negotiators can be reached in time to hold a summit of leaders in November to sign off the agreement. 
A British official speaking on the condition of anonymity said a November summit had begun to look like ""a stretch"".
Nevertheless, according to her spokesman, May opened the meeting by saying that while the UK should aim to conclude the withdrawal agreement as soon as possible, this would ""not be done at any cost.""
The spokesman also cautioned that an overall deal was made up of two parts: a withdrawal agreement, and a framework for future ties. Progress on the Irish backstop could seal the withdrawal agreement, but a deal would not have been completed until all details of the future framework were also tied up.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy said on Tuesday it will help a Pakistani Christian woman leave her country because her life is in danger following charges of blasphemy against Islam that put her on death row for eight years.
Pakistan's Supreme Court acquitted Asia Bibi last month but the decision sparked mass protests and her husband, Ashiq Masih, says they could be killed by Islamists. Authorities have indicated they will bar Bibi from traveling abroad.
The case has galvanized Christian and human rights groups outraged by the country's treatment of religious minorities including its tiny Christian population.
""I want women and children whose lives are at risk to be able to have a secure future, in our country or in other Western countries, so I will do everything humanly possible to guarantee that (for Bibi),"" Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said.
""It is not permissible that in 2018 someone can risk losing their life for a ... hypothesis of blasphemy,"" said Salvini, who is also interior minister and head of the League party, which has been critical of Islam in the past.
Italy is working discreetly on the case with other Western countries, he told an Italian radio station.
Earlier, the international Catholic agency Aid to the Church in Need (ACN) quoted Masih as saying in a telephone call: ""I appeal to the Italian government to help me and my family leave Pakistan.""
""We are extremely worried because our lives are in danger. We don't even have enough to eat because we can't go out to buy food,"" he told the agency.
In the interview with the radio station, Salvini was asked to respond to the husband's appeal.
Bibi's case has prompted groups such as ACN, which has close ties to the Vatican, to demand protection for Christians in countries where they are a minority. 
Bibi was convicted of blasphemy in 2010 after neighbors said she made derogatory remarks about Islam when they objected to her drinking water from their glass because she was not Muslim. She is a Protestant and denies committing blasphemy.
The ultra-right Tehreek-e-Labaik (TLP) party blocked major
roads in Pakistan's biggest cities for three days, calling for
the murder of the Supreme Court judges who acquitted Bibi
and calling Prime Minister Imran Khan and the army chief enemies of Islam.
The TLP called off the protests after striking a deal with the government that could bar Bibi from leaving the country and open a review of the verdict.
Bibi's lawyer Saiful Mulook, fled to the Netherlands because of fears for the safety of his family.
Two prominent Pakistani politicians who spoke out in her defense were assassinated in 2011.
Human rights groups such as Amnesty International say the blasphemy law is increasingly exploited by religious extremists as well as ordinary Pakistanis to settle personal scores.
Salvini said Italy had nothing against the Pakistani government. ""The enemy is violence, extremism and fanaticism,"" he said.
Masih and one of the couple's two daughter met Pope Francis at the Vatican in February and participated in a demonstration organized by ACN in which Rome's Coliseum was lit in red to bring attention to the woman's plight.
The group plans to dye parts of the Grand Canal in Venice red at another demonstration this month.

Masih has previously appealed to the United States, Britain and Canada for assistance in leaving the country.

BELFAST (Reuters) - The United Kingdom is heading toward leaving the European Union without a divorce deal, a senior member of the Northern Irish party which props up Prime Minister Theresa May's government said on Tuesday.
With less than five months until Britain is due to exit the EU, May has yet to clinch a divorce deal, with negotiators stuck on the so-called ""backstop"" arrangement that would keep open the border between British-ruled Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland regardless of what course Britain takes after Brexit.
""Looks like we're heading for no deal,"" Jeffrey Donaldson, one of 10 Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) lawmakers whose support May currently needs to get any deal passed in the British parliament, said on Twitter.
Sterling fell on the DUP remark. But it later recouped losses when Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said ""Thumbs up"" when asked by a BBC reporter to describe a cabinet meeting he had just attended in London on Brexit negotiations. 
The euro briefly fell to a five-month low against the British pound at 87.19 pence on Raab's comment. Against the dollar, the British currency rallied to $1.3073.
Many business chiefs and investors fear politics could scupper a deal, thrusting both the EU and the United Kingdom into a ""no-deal"" Brexit that they say would weaken the West, panic financial markets and block the arteries of trade.
British trade minister Liam Fox said on Tuesday it was ""impossible"" to say whether a Brexit deal could be reached with the EU this month or next, but that Britain wanted an agreement, and a deal is better than no deal.
German automotive supplier Schaeffler (DE:SHA_p) said it will shut two factories in Britain as part of changes prompted partly by Brexit.
IRISH BORDER
Negotiators are trying to find an emergency Irish border fix that would satisfy Ireland, the Democratic Unionist Party and May's divided Conservative Party.
Ireland insists that there must be no border infrastructure, the DUP insists Northern Ireland must not be treated differently from mainland Britain, and Brexiteers say Britain must have the right to do its own trade deals after Brexit.
The DUP position has caused friction before: nearly a year ago, a refusal by the DUP to sign off on a deal on the border caused the temporary collapse of talks at a crucial stage, before negotiators found a way to keep all sides on board.
An open frontier is seen as crucial to the 1998 Good Friday peace accord that ended decades of sectarian bloodshed in Northern Ireland. The backstop arrangement is intended to ensure a solution to the problem if no other solution is found. But London wants the backstop to be provisional rather than permanent, while the EU resists any suggestion it could expire.
On Monday, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said Dublin was willing to examine ways in which the backstop could be reviewed, so long as it does not permit Britain to unilaterally walk away from it, a move his European Affairs Minister Helen McEntee said on Tuesday could help move the talks forward.
The DUP's Donaldson, whose party has repeatedly criticized Dublin's approach, said a no-deal Brexit would have serious consequences for Ireland's economy and he ""can't understand why Irish Government seems so intent on this course.""

Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney spoke last month of ""carnage"" if Britain crashed out without a deal, though he said that would mostly be felt by the United Kingdom, with Ireland likely to benefit from solidarity from EU states.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Western countries including Canada, France and Germany called on China on Tuesday to close down detention camps, which activists say hold 1 million Uighurs and other Muslims.
At a debate at the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva -- which reports on human rights in each U.N. member state every five years and is reviewing China's record this week -- Beijing said it protected the freedoms of ethnic minorities.
But one after another, Western countries spoke out against what they described as a deterioration in China's human rights since the last review, especially over its treatment of Muslims in the western province of Xinjiang.
Beijing should ""halt massive imprisonment"" and ""guarantee freedom of religion and belief, including in Tibet and Xinjiang,"" France's ambassador Francois Rivasseau said. Germany called for an end to ""all unlawful detention including unconstitutional mass detention of Uighurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang.""
Canada's envoy Rosemary McCarney said Ottawa was ""deeply concerned by credible reports of mass detention, repression and surveillance of Uighurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang.
""Canada recommends that China release Uighurs and other Muslims who have been detained arbitrarily and without due process for their ethnicity or religion,"" she said. Similar statements were made by diplomats from Australia and Japan.
In his opening speech, Le Yucheng, China's vice minister for foreign affairs, made no mention of the allegations of mass detentions.
""We protect the rights of ethnic minorities in accordance with law, all 55 ethnic groups are represented in the National Congress and Chinese Communist Party,"" he said.
A United Nations panel of human rights experts said on Aug. 10 it had received many credible reports that 1 million ethnic Uighurs in China were being held in what resembles a ""massive internment camp that is shrouded in secrecy.""
China has said in the past that Xinjiang faces a threat from Islamist militants and separatists. It rejects all accusations of mistreatment and denies mass internment, although Chinese officials have said some citizens guilty of minor offences were being sent to vocational centers to work.

Around 1,000 Tibetan and Uighur protesters from around Europe protested outside the U.N. headquarters in Geneva during the debate.

The case focuses on Leviev's company, LLD Diamonds, a leading global manufacturer and marketer of polished diamonds, Police have said they expect to make more arrests, both in Israel and abroad.
Leviev's son Zevulun and brother Moshe are accused of involvement in a smuggling operation that has brought about 300 million shekels' ($80 million) worth of diamonds illegally into Israel since 2010, according to a transcript of a custody hearing held on Monday.
Israel is a world center for diamond cutting and polishing, with one of the biggest exchanges in the world, at Ramat Gan.
Lawyers representing Zevulun Leviev in a statement said the allegations against him were ""baseless"" and his arrest appeared to be a tactic to ""illegitimately pressure his father"".
Moshe Leviev's lawyer denied in court that his client had any connection to the allegations against him.
Lev Leviev, who was born in Uzbekistan and according to the court documents is currently believed to be in Russia, built his fortune in diamonds and property. 
LLD said in a statement it had no knowledge of the alleged smuggling.
""Mr. Leviev and the companies in his control operate in accordance with the proper norms while adhering to the law. We hope that the matter will be clarified soon and the suspicions will be proven baseless,"" it said.

KABUL (Reuters) - Every two months, Mohammaddin visits a tax collector in Chardara district, in northern Afghanistan, and is given receipts to show he has paid his tax and utility bills.
The service is professional, he says, though the paperwork he receives does not bear the name of state-owned power company Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat, which provides the electricity, but instead carries the printed logo of the Taliban.
""Given the strictness of Taliban regarding implementation of their rules and regulations, I think they raise more from tax collection than the Afghan government,"" said Mohammaddin, a resident of the district outside Kunduz city, which is largely under Taliban control despite repeated operations by government forces to try to push the insurgents back. ""They have proper tax collection and people cannot disobey them in areas they control.""
How much of Afghanistan is under effective Taliban control is disputed, but there is little doubt it has been growing and the insurgents are increasing their presence in the everyday lives of millions of ordinary Afghans such as Mohammaddin.
According to data from the NATO-led Resolute Support mission published last week, the government of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has control or influence over 65 percent of the population but only 55.5 percent of Afghanistan's 407 districts, less than at any time since the Taliban was driven from power in 2001. The Taliban says it controls 70 percent of the country.
As the insurgents have won ground, levies on land and day-to-day economic activities have added to funds raised from illegal mining and the drug trade, allowing the Taliban to bolster its credentials as a government-in-waiting.
""The Taliban have the power to just easily extort however much they want but that's not quite what they do. They try to look and behave like a state,"" said Ashley Jackson, author of ""Life Under the Taliban Shadow Government"", a study published this year by the British-based Overseas Development Institute.
The Taliban has tended to take over two traditional Islamic levies: zakat, an obligation on Muslims to donate 2.5 percent of their income to the poor; and ushur, a 10 percent tax on harvests or produce taken to market.
In addition, electricity and mobile phone bills, which the insurgents collect in return for leaving power pylons and phone masts alone, and small levies on businesses selling daily necessities such as bakeries or flour mills, weave Taliban authority firmly into everyday life.
Wahid Tawhidi, a spokesman for Breshna Sherkat said the group estimated it lost around 5 million afghani ($66,500) a year from payments diverted to the Taliban, particularly in the provinces of Kunduz, Baghlan, Helmand and Kandahar. But it considered itself a national power provider that had a duty to ensure equal service to all parts of the country, he said.
Ahmad, 37, who lives in the Taliban-controlled district of Dasht-e Archi, outside Kunduz, but owns a grocery shop in the city, which is under government control, says he pays 5 afghani (7 cents) per box of items in his shop, a total of around 600-700 afghani a month.
""I don't know what they call it, but I pay,"" he said.
LEVIES
Shahussain Murtazawi, spokesman for the President's Office in Kabul, said the Taliban still depended on foreign support from countries such as Pakistan and income from drugs and illegal mines, but acknowledged that the insurgents' ability to levy taxes was a reality in swathes of the country.
""Unfortunately we often receive complaints about Taliban's extortions and forcefully imposed taxes on people living in Taliban-controlled areas,"" he said.
Alongside courts, which even many people in government-controlled areas consider more reliable and fair than the official justice system, taxation is at the heart of Taliban efforts to build a state-in-waiting.
""The Taliban have a proper system of government,"" said Islamuddin, a truck driver from Nawzad district in Helmand, the volatile southern province on the other side of the country from Kunduz, who was stopping in the provincial capital Lashkar Gah.
""Just as the government collects taxes here in Lashkar Gah, the Taliban do it in areas they control in Nawzad.""
In exchange, the insurgents seek to portray themselves as effective guarantors of justice and security in areas where Islamic State, also known as Daesh, or loosely pro-government militias can ravage unprotected villages.
""We have mobile custom teams that normally get assigned in specific locations on large highways close to the borders to collect the tax, especially from large trucks importing or exporting goods,"" said Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid. 
""In most areas, based on agreement with the traders, we provide them security and they pay us 2 percent of the value of their goods.""
In the eastern province of Nangarhar, where Islamic State militants have struck repeatedly against schools, teachers have been forced to arm themselves and in many cases have turned to the Taliban for help.
""When the government failed to protect schools after a number of attacks by Daesh, the elders had to ask the Taliban to help protect schools,"" said Hasibullah Shinwari, director of education in Nangarhar, who regularly carries a weapon to work.
For many in the growing number of Taliban-controlled areas of Afghanistan, where 40 years of war have eroded the state's ability to provide basic services, the twin approach of taxes and protection has resulted in an increasing acceptance of Taliban government as a normal state of affairs. 

""For people living in Taliban-controlled areas, it's normal to pay taxes to the Taliban, because the Taliban are trying to properly govern the areas under their control,"" said Abdul, a 42-year-old from Aqtash district in Kunduz, who like others did not want his full name to be quoted for fear of reprisals.

The man, a former guard in the SS paramilitary wing of Hitler's Nazis who cannot be named for legal reasons, has denied the accusations. He spoke with a rough voice when answering questions about his identity. 
He is being tried in a youth court because he was under 21 at the time of the suspected crimes at the camp near what is now the Polish city of Gdansk. Hearings will last a maximum of two hours per day because of the man's fragile health. 
The former guard is accused of knowing about mass killings between 1942 and 1945, when he served in the Stutthof camp where about 65,000 people died - some in gas chambers, some by poisonous injection and others of cold.
The prosecutor told the court that the suspect had known about the gruesome methods used for killing victims, including shootings, freezing, starvation. The suspect looked down when the prosecutor mentioned the lethal gas Zyklon B. 

Germany has a patchy record in prosecuting war criminals, with many high-ranking Nazis and SS members escaping justice, but in the last decade some prosecutors have stepped up efforts to bring more junior members of the Nazi death machine to trial.

The government has promised to hold elections between February and May after repeated delays, a contest between supporters of the military and royalist establishment and the populist political forces now led by the Puea Thai Party that was ousted by the military in a 2014 coup.
Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai said past elections in the Southeast Asian country have been credible.
""To have others observing means the country is having a problem,"" he told reporters.
The last time Thailand held a successful election was in 2011 when the Yingluck Shinawatra and her Puea Thai Party won by a landslide. 
In February 2014, an election was disrupted by massive street protests that saw voting blocked in a fifth of the country's constituencies and eventually led to the May 2014 coup.
Human Rights Watch said foreign observers should be allowed to monitor the 2019 vote and called on the government to lift the ban on political activities to ensure the election is free and fair.
""As the countdown for an election has begun, the Thai military government seems to care about seeking hand-shake and photo opportunities at major international events, but refuses to allow foreign allies to come and witness what is going on the country where the environment for a free and fair election does not exist,"" Sunai Phasuk, senior Thailand researcher at Human Rights Watch, told Reuters.
The military government has recently relaxed some political restrictions by allowing political parties to organize but a ban on campaigning and gatherings of more than five people remains in place at least until December.

An election date has not been set but senior government officials have said that it would likely be on Feb. 24.

ANKARA (Reuters) - A 15-man Saudi team that flew to Turkey before the killing of Jamal Khashoggi must have been acting on orders, Turkey's foreign minister said, though he reiterated Ankara's stance that the directions had not come from King Salman.
Speaking to reporters in Tokyo, Mevlut Cavusoglu added that it was Saudi Arabia's responsibility to tell Turkey what happened to the Khashoggi's body, according to Anadolu news agency.
Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist critical of the Saudi government and its de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, disappeared at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.
Saudi officials initially insisted Khashoggi had left the consulate, then said he died in an unplanned ""rogue operation"". The kingdom’s public prosecutor Saud al-Mojeb later said he was killed in a premeditated attack.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who has repeatedly demanded more information from Saudi Arabia, has also asked Saudi officials to say who in Riyadh sent a 15-strong team which is suspected of involvement in the killing.
""This 15-man team did not come to Turkey on their own, they came on orders. Without due orders and permissions, 15 people cannot come from Saudi Arabia to kill their own citizen,"" Cavusoglu said.
Cavusoglu said Erdogan had spoken to Saudi Arabia's King Salman twice after the killing, and that he was sure the king would not give orders to kill someone.
Turkish and Saudi officials have carried out joint inspections of the consulate and consul’s residence, but Erdogan says some Saudi officials are still trying to cover up the crime. Ankara has also demanded Riyadh cooperate in finding Khashoggi’s body, which Istanbul’s chief prosecutor said had been dismembered.
""I think it is Saudi Arabia's responsibility to find out what happened to Khashoggi's body and inform us about it, as the 15-man team are still in Saudi Arabia,"" Cavusoglu said.

Saudi Arabia has so far detained 18 people and dismissed five senior government officials as part of an investigation into Khashoggi's death.

Sparsely populated Farah, on the border with Iran, has seen months of heavy fighting, with hundreds police and soldiers killed. The Taliban threatened to seize the provincial capital in May.
In the latest violence in the province, the insurgents assaulted the border post manned by about 50 Afghan government soldiers before dawn, officials in the area said.
At least 20 soldiers were known to have been killed, several wounded and the others were missing, said a senior military officer who declined to be identified as he is not authorized to speak to media.
""Hours after the attack, we lost contact with the base and we still do not know the whereabouts of the remaining soldiers,"" the officer said.
The Taliban, fighting to oust foreign forces and overthrow the Western-backed Kabul government, claimed responsibility saying they had captured the base, killed 30 soldiers and seized weapons and ammunition.
Some officials in Farah have accused Iran, which the United States says is trying to extend its influence in western Afghanistan, of providing the insurgents with money and weapons. Iran denies the accusation.
The attack underlined the struggle Afghan security forces face in confronting the insurgents, who have steadily extended their control in the countryside, even though the government holds all provincial centers.
On Monday, the militants captured an important security post outside the central city of Ghazni, killing 13 members of government forces and underscoring their vulnerability even in areas where defenses have been bolstered.
More than 17 years after U.S.-led forces toppled the Taliban regime, Afghan forces are dying in record numbers with Afghan and U.S. officials warning that the casualty rate is not sustainable. 
In September alone, more than 500 Afghan soldiers were killed and hundreds wounded, the Defence Ministry said.
Tentative steps toward peace talks between the Taliban and the United States have had no impact on the level of attacks.
The U.S. special envoy for peace in Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, met Taliban leaders in Qatar last month. The Taliban will also join multilateral peace talks hosted by Russia this week.

Two rafts were found in the Western Mediterranean between the Iberian peninsula and Morocco and Algeria with 80 people aboard and 13 dead. They were taken to the Spanish North African enclave of Melilla, the coast guard said. 
The coast guard also found four bodies and rescued 22 men in the Atlantic off the southern Spanish city of Cadiz.

The video which appeared on social media showed a cardboard model of the tower with cut outs of residents in the windows being set alight on a bonfire while those watching laughed and made jokes.
Grenfell Tower, a social housing block that was home to a close-knit, ethnically diverse community, was engulfed by flames in the middle of the night of June 14, 2017, killing 71 people in the country's deadliest domestic fire since World War Two.
""To disrespect those who lost their lives at Grenfell Tower, as well as their families and loved ones, is utterly unacceptable,"" Prime Minister Theresa May said on Twitter.
Police said five men, aged 19, 46, 55 and two 49-year-olds, had been arrested on suspicion of a public order offense after handing themselves into a police station in south London.

Beijing says its ""vocational training centers"" in Xinjiang camps teach employment skills and legal knowledge aimed at curbing religious extremism.
The report published on Monday by U.S. think-tank the Jamestown Foundation examined government budget data and found spending on security-related construction in Xinjiang rose last year by nearly 20 billion yuan ($2.90 billion), or 213 percent.
""Xinjiang's budget figures do not reflect increased spending on vocational education ... as the region ramped up camp construction; nor do they reflect an increase in criminal cases handled by courts and prosecutors,"" said the report's author, Adrian Zenz, an anthropologist at the European School of Culture and Theology in Germany.
""Rather, they reflect patterns of spending consistent with the construction and operation of highly secure political re-education camps designed to imprison hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs with minimal due process.""
It also found that despite the purported large ""vocational training"" campaign, employment outcomes had not markedly improved, according to Xinjiang's own official employment figures.
Whatever training the facilities do provide, Zenz said, it appeared it was not administered or paid for by the vocational education system. 
The Xinjiang government and the State Council Information Office, which doubles as the Communist Party's spokesman's office, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
On Tuesday, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said she did not personally know how much Xinjiang's security expenditure was.
Speaking at a daily news briefing, she asked whether Jamestown had also looked into how much money the Xinjiang local government had spent ""developing the economy and improving lives"".
Reports of mass detentions and strict surveillance of ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims have prompted the United States to consider sanctions against officials and companies linked to accusations of human rights abuses.
After initial blanket denials, Chinese officials said in recent weeks they were not enforcing arbitrary detention and political re-education across a network of secret camps, but rather that some citizens guilty of ""minor offences"" were sent to vocational centers to provide employment opportunities. 
While prison expenditure doubled between 2016 and 2017, spending on prosecution on criminal suspects was largely flat, Zenz said, indicating it was likely that few of the so-called criminals involved only in minor offences were put on formal trial.

China's record will be examined by the U.N. Human Rights Council on Tuesday, the first time since 2013, in a regular review expected to focus on its treatment of ethnic minorities, especially Uighurs and Tibetans.

Mevlut Cavusoglu's comments to reporters in Japan came a day after Washington reimposed sanctions, abandoning a 2015 deal between world powers and Iran over its nuclear program, while temporarily allowing major customers including Turkey to keep buying crude from the Islamic Republic.
""We do not believe any result can be reached with sanctions. I think meaningful dialogue and talks are more useful than sanctions,"" he said.
The decision by U.S President Donald Trump aims to hit Iran's oil-dependent economy and force Tehran to quash not only its nuclear ambitions and ballistic missile program but also its support for militant proxies in Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and other parts of the Middle East.
Washington has pledged to eventually halt all purchases of crude oil from Iran globally but for now it said eight countries - China, India, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Greece, Taiwan and Turkey - can continue imports without penalty. Crude exports contribute one-third of Iran's government revenues.
Turkey depends heavily on imports to meet its energy needs and neighboring Iran has been one of its main sources of oil because of its proximity, crude quality and favorable price differentials, traders say.
Cavusoglu also said it was not that easy for countries including Turkey and Japan to diversify energy resources to comply with the sanctions.

""Not only neighboring countries but many countries from many regions of the world are being impacted by these unilateral sanctions.""

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) on Monday said a human rights report it commissioned on its presence in Myanmar showed it had not done enough to prevent its social network from being used to incite violence.
The report by San Francisco-based nonprofit Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) recommended that Facebook more strictly enforce its content policies, increase engagement with both Myanmar officials and civil society groups and regularly release additional data about its progress in the country.
""The report concludes that, prior to this year, we weren't doing enough to help prevent our platform from being used to foment division and incite offline violence. We agree that we can and should do more,"" Alex Warofka, a Facebook product policy manager, said in a blog post.
BSR also warned that Facebook must be prepared to handle a likely onslaught of misinformation during Myanmar's 2020 elections, and new problems as use of its WhatsApp grows in Myanmar, according to the report, which Facebook released.
A Reuters special report https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/myanmar-facebook-hate in August found that Facebook failed to promptly heed numerous warnings from organizations in Myanmar about social media posts fueling attacks on minority groups such as the Rohingya.
In August 2017 the military led a crackdown in Myanmar’s Rakhine State in response to attacks by Rohingya insurgents, pushing more than 700,000 Muslims to neighboring Bangladesh, according to U.N. agencies.
The social media website in August removed several Myanmar military officials from the platform to prevent the spread of ""hate and misinformation,"" for the first time banning a country's military or political leaders.
It also removed dozens of accounts for engaging in a campaign that ""used seemingly independent news and opinion pages to covertly push the messages of the Myanmar military.""
The move came hours after United Nations investigators said the army carried out mass killings and gang rapes of Muslim Rohingya with “genocidal intent.”
Facebook said it has begun correcting shortcomings. 
Facebook said that it now has 99 Myanmar language specialists reviewing potentially questionable content. In addition, it has expanded use of automated tools to reduce distribution of violent and dehumanizing posts while they undergo review.
In the third quarter, the company said it ""took action"" on about 64,000 pieces of content that violated its hate speech policies. About 63 percent were identified by automated software, up from 52 percent in the prior quarter.
Human Rights Watch (HRW) in Asia said the report showed Facebook is working hard to address the issues and should step up its efforts, especially in combating hate speech ahead of the general election in 2020.
""It’s often said that in Myanmar, for all intents and purposes Facebook really is the Internet because of its widespread use among online users -- so Facebook needs to act accordingly to head off what will likely be a tsunami of hate speech and attacks in the 2020 election,"" said Phil Roberston, HRW deputy director.
Facebook has roughly 20 million users in Myanmar, according to BSR, which warned Facebook faces several unresolved challenges in Myanmar. 

BSR said locating staff there, for example, could aid in Facebook's understanding of how its services are used locally but said its workers could be targeted by the country's military, which has been accused by the U.N. of ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. military officer said on Monday that the United States would have to start making changes to its military posture on the Korean peninsula over time if talks with North Korea advance.
""The more successful we are in the diplomatic track, the more uncomfortable we will be in the military space,"" Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a forum at Duke University.
""Because over time, this negotiation will take a form where we're going to have to start making some changes to the military posture on the peninsula. And we're prepared to do that in support of Secretary Pompeo,"" Dunford said. He did not elaborate on what changes might be expected.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will meet with senior North Korean official Kim Yong Chol in New York on Thursday to discuss North Korea's denuclearization.
In Washington last week, South Korea's defense minister said the two countries would decide by December on major joint military exercises for 2019. Vigilant Ace, suspended this month, is one of several such exercises halted to encourage dialogue with Pyongyang, which has criticized joint U.S.-South Korea exercises in the past.
Although larger exercises were suspended, the two countries have continued small-scale drills.
On Monday, U.S. and South Korean marines conducted military drills under the Korean Marine Exchange Program for the first time in months, according to the South Korean ministry of defense.
North Korea has not tested a ballistic missile or nuclear weapon for nearly a year, and has said it has shuttered its main nuclear test site and plans to dismantle several more facilities.
In recent weeks, North Korea has pressed harder for what it sees as reciprocal concessions by the United States and other countries. 
In Seoul, presidential spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom declined to comment on Dunford's remarks and referred to previous statements on the issue by the leaders of North and South Korea.
""I'd like you to remember that Chairman Kim Jong Un said there is no correlation between declaring the end of the (Korean) war and a pullout of U.S. troops from South Korea, or a weakening of the South Korea-U.S. alliance, and that (South Korean) President Moon Jae-in also said to that effect several times,"" Kim said at a press briefing on Tuesday. 
Pyongyang has been pushing for a formal declaration to end the 1950-53 Korean War and replace the armistice that stopped the fighting but left the combatants still technically at war. 

There are concerns that North Korea's push for such a declaration could be a ploy to divide the U.S.-South Korea alliance and secure the withdrawal of the 28,500 U.S. troops based in the South.

WASHINGTON - The United States and China will hold a top-level diplomatic and security dialogue that was supposed to be held in Beijing in October in Washington on Friday, amid moves to try to resolve a damaging trade war.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Chinese politburo member Yang Jiechi and Defense Minister Wei Fenghe will take part in the talks, a statement from U.S. State Department said on Monday.
China said last month the two sides had initially agreed ""in principle"" to hold the second round of diplomatic security talks in October but they were postponed at Washington's request amid rising tensions over trade, Taiwan and the South China Sea.
Monday's announcement came after U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke by telephone last week and cheered world markets by expressing optimism about resolving their trade dispute ahead of a high-stakes meeting at the end of November in Argentina.
On Monday, Trump said China wanted to make a deal and added: ""If we can make the right deal, a deal that's fair, we'll do that. Otherwise we won’t do it.""
Earlier on Monday, Xi promised at the start of a trade expo to lower tariffs, broaden market access and import more from overseas.
Trump and Xi announced the updated negotiation framework last year and the first meeting in the format was held in June 2017 in Washington, when the two sides discussed issues including North Korea and the South China Sea.
Since then relations have soured and they have become embroiled in a major trade war in which the United States has imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods and China has retaliated with tariffs on $110 billion worth of U.S. goods.
Trump has railed against China for what he sees as intellectual property theft, entry barriers to U.S. business and a gaping trade deficit.
He has said that if a deal is not made he could impose tariffs on another $267 billion of Chinese imports and an across-the-board pressure campaign. 
Mattis had been due to hold talks with Wei in Beijing in October, but those plans were up-ended after Washington imposed sanctions on China's People's Liberation Army for buying weapons from Russia.

Mattis did meet Wei in Singapore on Oct. 18 and told him that the world's two largest economies needed to deepen high-level ties to reduce the risk of conflict.

""You are accused of being controversial just because you are trying to draw attention to things that aren't necessarily part of the conventional viewpoint,"" Charles said in an interview with GQ magazine in September. 
""My problem is I find there are too many things that need doing or battling on behalf of.""
Charles Philip Arthur George, Prince of Wales, Duke of Cornwall, Duke of Rothesay, Earl of Carrick, Baron of Renfrew, Earl of Chester, Lord of the Isles, and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland was born at Buckingham Palace on Nov. 14, 1948.
He was four when his grandfather George VI died and his mother ascended to the throne at the age of 25. The following year, Charles watched with his grandmother and aunt, the late Princess Margaret, as Elizabeth was crowned queen of 16 realms. 
He despised his remote Scottish school, Gordonstoun, which his father also attended, but was the first royal heir to get a degree after studying at Cambridge University.
Charles was made Prince of Wales at a grand ceremony in 1969. But at 92 his mother remains in good health with no plans to abdicate, so his wait goes on.
For his critics, and even some monarchists who think he will bring disaster upon the House of Windsor, that is no bad thing.
""Frankly we're very lucky he hasn't been king, because whereas the queen has been the most exemplary monarch and has kept the monarchy much in people's esteem, I think Charles would undermine it,"" said Tom Bower, author of 'Rebel Prince', an unauthorized biography. 
Such unflattering biographies portray Charles as an arrogant, weak man who enjoys the trappings of luxury - he has his own royal harpist - is intolerant of criticism, and is a devotee of oddball theories.
Charles declined to be interviewed for this article.
""HE'S COMPLICATED""
Charles' supporters say he is easy quarry, with every action and utterance scrutinized by an often unsympathetic media.
""When you're in his very exposed public position, loyalty and disloyalty is a quite complex situation,"" said a former senior aide who worked with the prince for many years.
He said detractors simply chose to view Charles's characteristics in a bad light. 
""There's a whole load of stuff that is just not true,"" the former aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters. ""Bower's only spoken to people with a grievance.""
So what is he really like?
""He's complicated. I've rarely met anyone so curious about the world as him and eager to know what's going on and why. More than anything, he's got this drive, he's phenomenally hard-working,"" the ex-aide said.
Simon Lewis, the queen's communications secretary from 1998 to 2001, described Charles as full of enthusiasm, committed, with a ""wicked sense of humor"".
""If you are a public figure ... if you put your head above the parapet then you get criticism,"" Lewis told Reuters.
Friends and foes speak of his devotion to duty. The prince's working day starts at breakfast - he doesn't have lunch - and finishes near midnight, every day. The ex-aide said he got a work-related call from Charles on Christmas Day.
In private, Charles is passionate about arts, culture, theater, literature, opera and pop - he's also a big fan of Leonard Cohen. 
Happiest in his garden, he's loves Shakespeare, paints watercolors and has written children's books. He can be fun but also short-tempered and demanding, the former aide said.
LIFE OF LUXURY?
Official figures show his recent overseas tours were the most expensive taken by the royals.
""He's ... intent on a very, very hyper-luxurious way of life, flying by private jet, (using the) royal train,"" said Bower, whose says his book was based on interviews with 120 people, many of whom worked for the royals.
Charles rejects such claims.
""Oh, don't believe all that crap,"" he told an Australian radio station in April when asked if it was true he traveled with his own toilet seat as Bower described. 
But he can still put on a regal show: If he entertains, there is beautiful food, wine and service.
""He thinks that's right for the Prince of Wales and I think people would be disappointed if it wasn't,"" the ex-aide said.
INTERFERING
It is not just his lifestyle that attracts umbrage.
His campaigning for causes such as the environment and climate change has led to accusations he is interfering in matters that British royals should avoid.
However, Charles has said it would be ""criminally negligent"" not to use his position to help people and his role has allowed him to express strong views. That would be impossible for a monarch, who under Britain's unwritten constitution, must remain apolitical. 
""There's a whole of lot of things I have tried to focus on over all these years that I felt needed attention, not everybody else did, but maybe now some years later they're beginning to realize that what I was trying to say was not quite as dotty as they thought,"" Charles said in an interview with younger son Harry in 2017.
His supporters say his causes - such as helping disadvantaged young people find work, and inter-faith dialogue - are often prescient and show concern for his fellow countrymen.
He acknowledges he has challenged orthodox views. He has long railed against a throwaway economic model that has polluted the world's oceans with plastic, now a mainstream concern.
But other views, such as his support for complementary medicine, still attract scorn. 
In 2013, it was revealed he had held 36 meetings with government ministers over three years, while two years later, Britain's top court ruled that dozens of his letters to ministers - dubbed the 'black spider memos' because of his scrawled handwriting - could be released.
Topics included rural housing, food in hospitals and the fate of the Patagonian Toothfish. 
DIANA
However, the issue that most fascinates the public remains Charles's divorce from Diana, her early death in a 1997 Paris car crash and his subsequent marriage in 2005 to Camilla. Some blame Camilla for the failure of his first marriage.
Opinion polls indicate Charles's standing has never fully recovered from damage suffered during the 1990s. A poll in January 2018 found 9 percent picked Charles as among their favorite royals.
The same poll found 54 percent had favorable opinions of the prince compared to 24 percent unfavorable. His mother and sons William and Harry are viewed favorably by more than 80 percent of Britons.
In a TV interview in 1995, Diana suggested Charles did not want to be king and was not cut out for such a ""suffocating"" role. Not so, say those who worked with him.
""Charles, the Prince Of Wales, is going to be the best prepared monarch probably in history and I think he'll be a very good king,"" Lewis said.
Although Charles is loath to talk about becoming monarch, as it will mean the death of his mother, behind the scenes well-prepared plans for the occasion - codenamed Operation London Bridge - are ready.
Until then, his unique life as heir will go on.

""People rightly talk about the privilege and the money and the palaces and the Bentleys,"" the prince's former aide said. ""It is a privilege, but it carries a great burden. I would never wish that life on anyone.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will hold a new round of talks with a senior North Korean official in New York on Thursday, hoping to open the way for a second summit of the two countries' leaders and make progress on denuclearization.
Pompeo and Kim Yong Chol, a senior aide of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, will ""discuss making progress on all four pillars of the Singapore Summit joint statement, including achieving the final, fully verified denuclearization"" of North Korea, the State Department said in a statement on Monday. 
President Donald Trump met Kim Jong Un in Singapore in June, the first summit meeting of an incumbent U.S. president and a North Korean leader.
At that meeting, Kim Jong Un, who seeks relief from tough U.S.-led sanctions, committed to work toward denuclearization, but his steps since have fallen short of U.S. demands for irreversible moves to abandon a weapons program that potentially threatens the United States.
South Korea is cooperating with Washington on sanctions against the North and expects progress from Pompeo's meeting, said its national security adviser, Chung Eui-yong. 
""We expect considerable progress on denuclearization...and expect working-level talks to follow the high-level talks,"" he told a parliamentary hearing in Seoul on Tuesday.
On Friday, North Korea warned it could resume development of its nuclear program if the United States did not drop its sanctions campaign.
In Singapore, Kim and Trump also committed to building ""a lasting and stable peace regime,"" but Pyongyang has been disappointed by U.S. reluctance to agree a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War before the North gives up nuclear weapons.
Chung said Seoul was still trying to work out a deal to officially declare an end to the Korean War by the end of this year, a goal seen as increasingly doubtful in the face of opposition in Washington.
The outgoing commander of American troops in South Korea voiced support on Monday for controversial measures to reduce military activity along the border with North Korea.
Writing in a South Korean military publication, U.S. General Vincent Brooks said recent steps by South and North Korea to disarm areas along the demilitarized zone between them had ""the support and agreement of the United States"".

Later on Monday, the top U.S. military officer, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Marine General Joseph Dunford, said the United States would have to start making changes to its military posture on the Korean peninsula over time if talks with the North advanced.

Carlos Carrillo, one of Martinelli's lawyers, said he was being held in the hospital's coronary unit, but declined to give further details about his client's health.
Martinelli, 66, ""was evaluated immediately by medical personnel in the prison system and paramedics ... who determined that he was in stable condition,"" the country's prison system said in a statement, adding that Martinelli had been transferred to receive more rigorous testing.
The former supermarket tycoon, who was president from 2009 to 2014, has been held in El Renacer prison on the Panama City outskirts since June after being extradited from the United States to face charges that he used public money to spy on more than 150 political rivals during his presidency.
He has maintained his innocence and has said he is a victim of political persecution by current President Juan Carlos Varela, a former political ally.

1665,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 08:14PM ET</span>",USOC seeks to revoke USA Gymnastics' status as governing body,"By Frank Pingue
(Reuters) - The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) has taken the first steps to revoke USA Gymnastics of its status as the national governing body for the sport in the latest fallout from the sex abuse scandal involving a former team doctor.
The USOC said the challenges facing the governing body, which is trying to recover from a scandal over the sexual abuse of hundreds of female athletes by ex-team doctor Larry Nassar, are more than it is capable of overcoming in its current form.
""This is a situation in which there are no perfect
solutions,"" USOC chief executive Sarah Hirshland said in an open letter to the gymnastics community. ""Seeking to revoke recognition is not a decision that we have come to easily, but I
believe it is the right action.
""In the short-term, we will work to ensure that America’s
gymnasts have the support necessary to excel on and off the field of play.""
USA Gymnastics has been in turmoil ever since dozens of female gymnasts, including Olympic champions such as Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney, Gabby Douglas and Simone Biles, came forward to accuse Nassar of sexual abuse.
Over the past two years, three CEOs -- Steve Penny, Kerry Perry and interim chief Mary Bono -- have been forced out of the organization after being criticized for the way they handled the situation.
Bono resigned just four days into the job last month following criticism by some top gymnasts about whether the former Republican congresswoman was fit to lead the organization.
Then Penny was arrested on charges he tampered with evidence in the Nassar case.
USA Gymnastics said in a statement its board of directors was seated in June and inherited an organization it described as being in crisis and with significant challenges that were years in the making.
""In the four months since, the Board has done everything it could to move this organization toward a better future,"" the board of directors said.
""We immediately took steps to change the leadership and are currently conducting a search to find a CEO who can rebuild the organization and, most importantly, regain the trust of the gymnastics community.""
Nassar was sentenced in February to up to 125 years in prison after some 200 women testified about decades of abuse at his hands.
In her letter, Hirshland said ""you deserve better"" and that the USOC even offered USA Gymnastics the option of surrendering its recognition voluntarily.
Hirshland also said in the letter a review panel will be identified, a hearing will be held, a report will be issued and a recommendation will be made. Then the USOC board will vote to continue to recognize USAG, or to revoke that status.
Seeking a revocation does not guarantee a particular outcome.
Hirshland did not say how long the process would take and that the USOC would make every effort to proceed quickly. She also called this moment the beginning of an important process for gymnastics in the United States.
""The path is not crystal clear, but our motives are,"" Hirshland wrote.
""So, we move forward, committed to ensuring the type of organization each gymnast and the coaches, trainers and club owners who support them, deserves.""
The announcement comes a day after the conclusion of the world gymnastics championships in Doha where Biles became the first female gymnast in 30 years to claim a medal in all six events at a major competition, including a record fourth all-around title for a woman. Her haul included four golds, one silver and a bronze.
Lawyers for a number of Nassar victims who filed lawsuits against both the governing body and the USOC said the Committee's move was not enough.
""Today's announcement by USOC seeks only to deflect from their total failure over decades to protect the gymnasts in their care,"" lawyers Michelle Simpson Tuegel and Mo Aziz said in a statement.
""In protecting and enabling Larry Nassar for so long, USAG and USOC failed in its core mission - which it claims is to empower athletes - and gave a known child abuser unfettered access to hundreds of victims.

""It is high time that the institution and its enablers that failed to protect and care for these young women as minors be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.""

1666,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 07:11PM ET</span>","In China, female pilots strain to hold up half the sky","By Brenda Goh
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - When Han Siyuan first decided to apply for a job as a pilot cadet in 2008, she was up against 400 female classmates in China on tests measuring everything from their command of English to the length of their legs.
Eventually, she became the only woman from her university that Shanghai-based Spring Airlines picked for training that year. She is now a captain for the Chinese budget carrier, but it has not become much easier for the women who have come after her. 
Han is one of just 713 women in China who, at the end of 2017, held a license to fly civilian aircraft, compared with 55,052 men. Of Spring Airlines' 800 pilots, only six are women.
""I've gotten used to living in a man's world,"" she said. 
China's proportion of female pilots – at 1.3 percent - is one of the world's lowest, which analysts and pilots attribute to social perceptions and male-centric hiring practices by Chinese airlines. 
But Chinese airlines are struggling with an acute pilot shortage amid surging travel demand, and female pilots are drawing attention to the gender imbalance. 
Chinese carriers will need 128,000 new pilots over the next two decades, according to forecasts by planemaker Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, and the shortfall has so far prompted airlines to aggressively hire foreign captains and Chinese regulators to relax physical entry requirements for cadets.
""The mission is to start cutting down the thorns that cover this road, to make it easier for those who come after us,"" said Chen Jingxian, a Shanghai-based lawyer who learned to fly in the United States and is among those urging change. 
'TOKEN EFFORTS'
Such issues are not confined to China; the proportion of female pilots in South Korea and Japan, where such jobs do not conform to widespread gender stereotypes, is also less than 3 percent.
But it is a sharp contrast to the situation in India, which, like China, has a fast-growing aviation market. But thanks to aggressive recruiting and support such as day care, India has the world's highest proportion of female commercial pilots, at 12 percent.
China's airlines only hire cadets directly from universities or the military. They often limit recruitment drives to male applicants and very rarely take in female cohorts. 
In addition, unlike in other markets, such as the United States, China does not allow people to convert private flying licenses to commercial certificates for flying airliners. 
Li Haipeng, deputy director of the Civil Aviation Management Institute of China's general aviation department, said many airlines were also dissuaded to hire women by generous maternity leave policies. That has been further aggravated by Beijing's move in 2015 to change the one-child policy, he added. 
""Male pilots do not have the issue of not being able to fly for two years after giving birth, and after the introduction of the second-child policy, airlines are not willing to recruit and train a pilot only to have her not being able to fly for about five years,"" he said.
He said Air China, China Eastern Airlines and China Southern (NYSE:SO) Airlines had all made some effort to recruit female pilots, adding ""nearly all other companies do not.""
China Eastern and China Southern declined to comment while Air China did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
Pilots said that hiring decisions were usually left to individual airlines and did not appear to be driven by the country's regulator, the Civil Aviation Administration of China, whose recruitment requirements do not mention gender. 
Xiamen Airlines, a China Southern subsidiary, told Reuters it offers up to 540 days of maternity leave. It started recruiting female pilots in 2008, and paused for a few years in between before resuming last year. Out of its 2,700 pilots, 18 are women while another 18 are in training.
""Allowing more women to become pilots is undoubtedly a good way to supplement (an airline's) flying capability,"" a spokesman for the carrier said.
PERSUASION AND PUBLICITY
The strongest calls for change are coming mostly from Chinese female pilots, thanks to a slew of returnees who learned how to fly while living abroad in countries like the United States. 
In March, the China Airline Pilots Association (ChALPA) established a female branch at an event attended by pilots from the People's Liberation Army Air Force and local airlines, according to media reports. 
Chen, the lawyer who also serves as a vice-president of the ChALPA's women's branch, said she and others have been trying to spread the word by speaking about the issue at air shows in China.
Eventually, she said, the organization hopes to persuade Chinese airlines to adjust their recruitment and maternity policies. 
Another key obstacle to tackle, she added, was the inability of general aviation pilots to shift to the commercial sector.
""It's a systemic issue,"" she said. ""We hope that change can happen in three to five years, but this is not something that is up to us."" 
Others like Han, who in recent months has appeared in Spring Airlines promotional videos, said she hoped the growing publicity would help to raise awareness.

""I can't personally give people opportunities,"" she said. ""But I hope that (the publicity) can slowly help open the door for companies or for girls with dreams to fly.""

Ten other soldiers were injured in the attack in Amazonas state, which Padrino said was retribution for Venezuela's capture of ""nine Colombian paramilitary members,"" the latest sign of worsening relations between the South American neighbors.
""We will find the paramilitaries wherever they are,"" Padrino said in a statement on state television. ""For now, I say to them: leave Venezuela. There is no space here. There has never been any space here for you.""
He did not specify how many more troops had been sent to the border. The injured soldiers were not in critical condition, Padrino said.
Incidents involving Venezuelan soldiers along the porous, 2,200-km (1,367-mile) border are fairly common, and have contributed to diplomatic tensions between the two countries.
In September, Colombia sent a letter of protest to Caracas after Venezuelan soldiers crossed into its territory and detained three Colombian citizens.
Colombia has been a leading critic of Venezuela's socialist President Nicolas Maduro. The OPEC country has been suffering through an economic collapse since Maduro took office in 2013 and Colombia has been the main haven for Venezuelans fleeing severe food and medicine shortages.
In a statement on Monday, Venezuelan opposition party Popular Will attributed the attack to the National Liberation Army (ELN), a Colombian rebel group. The opposition has long accused Maduro of turning a blind eye to the presence of violent Colombian groups operating in Venezuelan territory.
Colombia's foreign ministry said in a statement later on Monday that one of the nine people captured by Venezuela was Luis Ortega, a Colombian citizen and ELN leader with an Interpol blue notice for alleged crimes committed in Colombia. 
A blue notice is used to ask other jurisdictions to cooperate in determining an individual's identity, location or activities related to a crime, according to Interpol.

""We haven't set anything up yet. We don't know that that's going to be the right place. I'm going to be in Paris for other reasons. But we will be meeting at the G20,"" Trump said at Joint Base Andrews before leaving on a campaign trip.
""I'm not sure we'll have a meeting in Paris. Probably not.""
Trump and Putin had planned to hold a bilateral meeting in Paris on Nov. 11 on the sidelines of events to commemorate the centenary of the end of World War One.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told RIA news agency that Putin and Trump were bound to meet, but will not hold ""substantive"" talks.
""That's true that the circumstances have been slightly changed. The multilateral format of events to commemorate the centenary of World War One does not allow the two presidents to have substantive meetings,"" RIA cited Peskov as saying.
He said the two would have ""standing talks"" in Paris to make a decision on a further formal meeting.
Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, said last month the Paris meeting would be brief and more of ""a base-touching exercise"" during which the two leaders will discuss whether Putin would accept Trump's invitation to come to Washington.

On Friday, a Kremlin aide said Putin and Trump would meet for a long session on the sidelines of the Nov. 30-Dec. 1 G20 summit in Argentina.

Britain would back ""remain"" by 54 percent to 46 percent, the study by Survation for the broadcaster showed. It estimated that more than a hundred local authorities would now vote to stay.
""Leave"" won the June 2016 vote by 51.9 percent to 48.1 percent. Prime Minister Theresa May has repeatedly ruled out another referendum on the issue.
Brexiteers argue May's predecessor David Cameron said during the campaign that the decision would be final and there would be no re-runs. They say May should get on with delivering Brexit.
But those who back a ""People's Vote"" on any final deal say May's vision for Brexit was not on the ballot paper in 2016, so the public should be allowed another say when the terms of Brexit are known.
Survation interviewed 20,000 people online between Oct. 20 and Nov. 2. Up to now polls have shown no major change in public opinion. Most polls predicted ""Remain"" would win before the 2016 referendum. 
Britain is due to leave the bloc on March 29, with London and Brussels yet to secure an agreement on the terms of the UK's departure and avoid a disruptive ""no deal"" scenario.
Even if May overcomes infighting in her own Conservative Party to finalize an agreement, the Survation poll found that 33 percent of people would reject the deal compared to just 26 percent who would accept it.
Should May be unable to agree a deal by March 29, 36 percent said Britain should leave without a deal, 35 percent said it should stay in the EU and 19 percent said departure should be delayed until an agreement is reached.

However, if May did agree a deal, 43 percent would support a referendum to choose between accepting the deal or remaining in the EU, compared to 37 percent who would oppose the choice, the survey found.

LISBON (Reuters) - It would be ""morally repugnant"" if the world fails to ban autonomous machines from being able to kill people without human involvement, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Monday. 
As the capability of artificial intelligence grows rapidly, there have been growing concerns about the possibility of killer robots, or other machines, being developed to fight wars. 
Speaking to Reuters during the Web Summit technology conference which opened in Lisbon on Monday, Guterres praised the ""enormous benefits"" of new technology. 
But he said it was crucial that the world works to avoid ""autonomous machines with the power and the capacity to take human lives on their own without human control"".
""This is the kind of thing that in my opinion is not only politically unacceptable, it is morally repugnant and I believe it should be banned by international law,"" he said.
New technology has made it possible to devise increasingly autonomous weapons systems, from drones to tanks. Robots are also being developed for potential use in wars. 
Guterres, who is Portuguese, said there is currently no international consensus that ""international humanitarian law applies to cyber use in conflict situations"", making regulation of autonomous weapons used in conflicts more difficult.
""It is an area where I believe the international community needs to come together,"" he said, adding that the United Nations could work as a platform for cooperation of cyber space to create codes of conduct. ""The worst thing we can be is naive and ignorant optimists.""
To start this work, the U.N. created this year a high-level panel on digital cooperation. It is chaired by Melinda Gates and Jack Ma, the executive chairman of Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA).
Still, Guterres said international divisions could make cooperation on cyber space more difficult, especially at a time when there is a new trend to question ""multilateral mechanisms which are the only way to answer global challenges"".
Guterres underlined that he believed the digital era and technology had brought big benefits, including new ways to fight disease and hunger.

""It is clear that technology is an ally,"" he said, pointing to areas such as alternative energy.

1674,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 02:48PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Pentagon balked at U.S. border troops building detention facilities - officials,"By Phil Stewart
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration discussed using the U.S. military to build facilities to house detained migrants as part of its new mission on the Mexican border but the idea was dropped after the Pentagon expressed doubts about it, U.S. officials said.
The disclosure by U.S. officials, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, illustrates the tension within the administration over using military resources to fortify the border against illegal immigration, a top election issue for President Donald Trump's base. 
Last week, the military announced that over 7,000 troops would go to the border with Mexico as a caravan of Central American migrants slowly heads toward the United States. 
The U.S. military declined a draft proposal from the Department of Homeland Security last month to build housing for detained migrants during early discussions in the Trump administration about the military's role on the border, the officials said.
By voicing its opposition, the Pentagon helped ensure that its mission was tailored to only providing support to U.S. government personnel on the border, U.S. officials said. 
After initial discussions about the issue, there was no mention of troops building migrant housing facilities when the DHS later made a formal request to the Pentagon for help on the border, the officials said.
Asked about the proposal on Monday, the Pentagon declined comment on internal administration deliberations but added that it did not receive a request from DHS to build facilities to house migrant families.
Trump said last week he plans to build tents to house migrants, who would be held in those facilities while the U.S. government weighs their asylum request. 
""We're going to have tents. They're going to be very nice. They're going to wait and if they don't get asylum, they get out,"" Trump told Fox News.
General Terrence O'Shaughnessy, the head of U.S. Northern Command, which is overseeing the deployment, told reporters last week that there were no plans at the moment for the U.S. military to build lodging for migrants.
""The requests that we have from the Department of Homeland Security and CBP (Customs and Border Protection) is to build (facilities) to support CBP personnel and our military personnel,"" he said.
Pentagon spokesman Colonel Robert Manning told reporters more than 4,800 troops were already deployed near the border as of Monday in support of Operation Faithful Patriot, including 1,100 troops in California, 1,100 in Arizona and 2,600 in Texas. He anticipated that the number of active duty troops could reach 7,000 soon. 
It was unclear how many of those forces had taken up missions on the border, which will include support tasks like building housing for Customs and Border Protection personnel and erecting barriers. 
Manning said only military police would carry weapons and stressed that there were no plans for U.S. troops to come in contact with protesters or migrants. He said they would not be taking part in law enforcement activities like crowd control.
One U.S. official cautioned that a previous Trump administration request dating back to spring for U.S. National Guard troops to build facilities for migrants on U.S. bases was still being deliberated. But, the official noted, that was not expected to be part of Faithful Patriot and the timing of any such future mission was unclear. 
Trump's push to send the military to the border comes ahead of Tuesday's mid-term congressional elections and has triggered sharp reactions, with critics calling it a political stunt that misuses U.S. military resources. 

However, Trump's effort has been embraced by Republicans running in the elections, in which illegal immigration is a top issue. The administration says it needs to harden border security as the Central American caravan heads north.

1675,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 01:47PM ET</span>",Facebook's Cameroon problem: stop online hate stoking conflict,"By Edward McAllister
YAOUNDE (Reuters) - A video link posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on June 20 showed a man cooking human body parts in a pot over a wood fire. 
In Cameroon, the footage went viral. Some Facebook users said the man was a cannibal and that the video was shot in the country's English-speaking west, where separatist insurgents are fighting to create a breakaway state.
Local websites quickly debunked this notion. The man in the video was not a separatist fighter or cannibal, and the body parts were not real. The clip was taken on a Nigerian film set and uploaded to Instagram on June 17 by make-up artist Hakeem Onilogbo, who uses the platform to showcase his work.
But the video's rapid spread raises questions about Facebook's ability to police millions of posts each day and crack down on hate speech in a country where internet use is rising fast, social media are used for political ends and the company has no permanent physical presence. 
The day the link was posted on Facebook, a member of the government brought the video to the attention of international diplomats in the capital, Yaounde, via the WhatsApp messaging service, according to messages seen by Reuters.
Five days later, Cameroon's minister for territorial administration cited it as justification for an army clampdown against the secessionists that was already under way in the Anglophone regions.
The minister, Paul Atanga Nji, compared the rebellion - over decades of perceived marginalization by the French-speaking majority - to an Islamist insurgency waged by the Nigeria-based militant group Boko Haram which has killed 30,000 people.
""Boko Haram committed atrocities, but they did not cut up humans and cook them in pots,"" the minister said in comments broadcast on state television and widely reported in Cameroon.
Nji did not respond to requests for comment. Government spokesman Issa Tchiroma Bakary said that in future the government would work to verify information before commenting. 
Facebook said the video had not been reported by users and that it could not comment further on the clip. It was no longer available on the site by late October. 
A senior Facebook official said tackling misinformation in Cameroon was a priority for the company, which acknowledges more needs to be done.
""We're prioritizing countries where we've already seen how quickly online rumors can fuel violence, such as Myanmar and Cameroon,"" said Ebele Okobi, Director of Africa Public Policy at Facebook.
UNDER FIRE 
Facebook is under fire for carrying misleading information, including in the United States and Britain, and over posts against the Muslim Rohingya minority in Myanmar which have had deadly consequences.
Sri Lankan authorities briefly banned Facebook this year because the government said it was fueling violence between Buddhists and Muslims. In India, messages on Facebook-owned WhatsApp have been linked to attacks on religious minorities.
In Cameroon, Facebook has been used both to incite violence and to make threatening posts. 
Simon Munzu, a former United Nations representative, said he was the target of death threats on Facebook after it was announced in July that he would help organize negotiations in the separatist conflict. Afraid, Munzu went to stay with friends. 
Facebook removed the posts in October, after it was made aware of them by Reuters, saying they violated company standards. 
Esther Omam, who runs a non-governmental organization (NGO) called Reach Out, hid at a church and then fled to the Francophone region after receiving death threats from separatists following a peace march which she led, she told Reuters. 
""The crisis has destroyed my life and my family,"" she said. ""I cannot work anymore. My family is divided. My husband is elsewhere, my children are elsewhere.""
Facebook has no staff operating permanently in Cameroon and says it monitors the country from Britain and the United States. It has an Africa-focused team that frequently visits the region, and has partnered with NGOs and civil society in Cameroon in recent months to combat hate speech. 
This included paying several thousand dollars to civil society to help organize training sessions for journalists to spot falsehoods online, representatives from two groups involved told Reuters. Some groups also flag offensive posts to Facebook.
Facebook has removed pages and accounts related to the separatist conflict, and is working to slow the spread of kidnapping videos, the company said. 
It declined to say how many people it had helping it in Cameroon, how much money it had so far invested or how many posts it had taken down. 
Reuters found dozens of pages posted in recent months showing graphic images in Cameroon, some of which were months old. 
One Facebook user on July 18 posted a picture of the decapitated body of a Cameroonian policeman lying in a gutter, and said the image gave him joy.
The same day, separatist spokesman Ivo Tapang applauded the killing of two Cameroonian soldiers and linked to a website raising funds for guns, ammunition and grenade launchers. Tapang did not respond to requests for comment. 
A Facebook spokeswoman said the company was unaware of the posts before Reuters pointed them out but that they were both removed after review. It is against Facebook rules to celebrate suffering or crowdfund for arms, she said. 
Facebook has artificial intelligence that it uses globally to detect problematic posts. But in Cameroon, it does not have a consortium of fact-checking companies to monitor posts -- as it does in the United States. 
Leading civil society figures in Cameroon say Facebook needs more resources and faces an increasingly difficult task as internet use grows. 
""It is not possible to stop misinformation on Facebook,"" said Maximilienne Ngo Mbe, executive director of REDHAC, a civil society group that has organized training sessions and flags indecent posts to Facebook. 
NO EASY FIX 
The number of people with internet access in Cameroon rose from 0.86 million in 2010 to 5.9 million in 2016, about a quarter of the population, according to the International Telecommunications Union, a U.N. agency.
The government shut down the internet in English-speaking regions for three months last year because of the unrest. 
After service resumed in April 2017, Facebook was the main outlet for people speaking out against the army crackdown, in which soldiers razed villages and shot dead unarmed civilians. 
But misleading and hateful posts have persisted, groups that monitor posts say, echoing issues Facebook sees worldwide. 
Facebook is not the only service facing a battle to tackle misinformation and hate speech. Offensive videos and images are posted on Twitter or transmitted by WhatsApp. 

WhatsApp cannot view private, encrypted conversations, a WhatsApp spokeswoman said, so detecting hate speech there is harder. A Twitter spokeswoman said it prohibits the promotion of violence and encourages users to flag those posts.

1676,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>","In warning about far-right in Europe, Macron mentions Hitler","PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron has ratcheted up warnings about the rising threat of far-right nationalism, saying in an interview with a regional French newspaper that complacency was what allowed for the rise of Hitler and Mussolini.
Speaking to Le Courrier Picard, a newspaper that covers northern France, where Macron has been visiting World War One memorials, the president was challenged over comparisons he has made between current events and the 1930s in Europe.
The newspaper asked if he wasn't exaggerating by comparing right-wing nationalists today to Germany's Nazis or Italy's fascists, saying he was ""distorting the historical record"".
""The times are different,"" Macron acknowledged. ""But who won the last European elections in France? The National Front, which everyone seems to have just gotten used to. Who came second in the last regional elections in northern France? The National Front. Who made it through to the second round of the presidential election? The National Front,"" he said.
The National Front has since been renamed The National Rally by its leader Marine Le Pen, who lost resoundingly to Macron in the run-off of the May 2017 presidential election. Le Pen's party now leads Macron's En Marche in the polls ahead of the European Parliament election next May.
Macron warned that if someone suggests that far-right nationalists are less threatening nowadays than they were in the past, one runs the risk of becoming complacent toward them. 
""I would suggest that you reread what was said at the time,"" the 40-year-old president said.
""Well-educated, well-informed people said that we could get along with the nationalists. As I recall, nobody, not even the wealthiest and the best educated, blocked the rise of Hitler in one country and Mussolini in another.
""I want to draw everyone's attention to this point. Is it the case that nationalist sentiments are rising? Yes. Are the people who are pushing for a return to conflict not those who are gaining ground in a number of European countries? Yes.""
Macron, who has introduced a raft of economic reforms since becoming president but saw his popularity fall to a new low of 21 percent last week, has cast the European Parliament election as a showdown between pro-European ""progressives"" like himself and EU-sceptic populists on the far-right.
Those forces are arguably strongest in France and Italy, where Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini's League party has gained support as its leader goes head-to-head with Brussels.
Macron said the world was seeing a resurgence of authoritarianism, with the risk of arms proliferation. 

""We must look these (nationalisms and extremes) in the face and tackle the root causes of the inequalities that exist,"" said. ""That's what I'm trying to do.""

1678,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>","Yemeni civilians trapped by Hodeidah fighting, aid groups say","By Mohammed Ghobari and Aziz El Yaakoubi
ADEN/DUBAI (Reuters) - Thousands of Yemeni civilians are trapped on the southern outskirts of the Red Sea port of Hodeidah as forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition battle Houthi insurgents entrenched in the city, aid groups said on Monday. 
The alliance has massed thousands of Yemeni troops in recent days near the heavily defended port, but a source in the coalition told Reuters there were no immediate plans for an assault.
The United Nations has said an attack on the city, entry point for 80 percent of impoverished Yemen's food imports and relief supplies, would risk triggering a famine.
The fighting has reached populated areas around a university 4 km (2.5 miles) from the port and has come close to the main hospital for the first time, aid groups and residents said.
""All the people living between the airport and the university are trapped, the last four days have been very tough, it is beyond catastrophic levels,"" said Isaac Ooko, Hodeidah area manager for the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC). 
""Air strikes have been very intense and the hovering of the jets causes permanent anxiety ... Hodeidah has become a ghost city, people stay indoors and the streets are deserted,"" he told Reuters by telephone.
Juliette Touma, spokeswoman for the U.N. children's fund UNICEF who was recently in Hodeidah, voiced fears for al-Thawra, the main hospital on Yemen's western coast and a center of cholera and diphtheria treatment.
""You could hear the fighting from the hospital and from our guest house close to it,"" she said.
CEASEFIRE CALLS
Capturing Hodeidah would allow the Saudi-led coalition to cut off the main supply line of the Iranian-aligned Houthis, who control most of northern Yemen, including the capital Sanaa.
Bandar al-Aiban, head of the official Saudi national human rights commission, told the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva that coalition forces were ""doing their best to spare civilians, particularly women and children, civilian sites, and infrastructure as a side-effect of the armed conflict"".
Western countries have called for a ceasefire to support efforts to end a war that has lasted more than three years and killed more than 10,000 people.
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have not publicly commented on those calls, but the coalition source said the military deployment aimed to put pressure on the Houthis to return to negotiations. U.N.-led talks in Geneva fell apart in September after the Houthis failed to show up. 
The Sunni Muslim coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the UAE intervened in Yemen in 2015 to try to restore the internationally recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and has been under growing international scrutiny over civilian deaths.
It relies heavily on Western arms and intelligence in the conflict, widely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
But its relationship with key Western allies has been badly strained by the murder of prominent journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month.

1679,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>",Tusk says Poland risks following UK out of EU,"WARSAW (Reuters) - European Council President Donald Tusk urged his fellow Poles on Monday to ""come to their senses"" over Poland's place within the EU, saying it could otherwise end up following Britain's example and tumble out of the bloc.
Tusk, a centrist who served as Polish prime minister from 2007 to 2014, is a strong critic of the ruling eurosceptic Law and Justice party (PiS) in Warsaw, which has often clashed with Brussels over immigration, the rule of law and other issues.
Tusk, who chairs EU summits, said that in 2016 Britain's then-prime minister David Cameron had not intended to take his country out of the bloc when he called a referendum, adding that Poland too could exit as a result of political miscalculations.
""It does not matter to me whether (PiS leader) Jaroslaw Kaczynski plans to leave the EU or just initiates some processes that lead to that outcome,"" Tusk told reporters during a visit to Warsaw.
""The issue is that Cameron also had no plan to take the UK out of the EU. And the will (among member states) to keep Poland inside the EU is smaller than the will to keep the UK in it.
""This issue is incredibly serious, the risk is deadly serious, I want everybody to come to their senses,"" Tusk added.
STRAINED TIES
Warsaw has no plans to hold a UK-style referendum on remaining in the EU, which it joined in 2004, but the European Commission is conducting an unprecedented investigation into the rule of law in Poland as well as several legal cases.
Last month, ahead of local elections, it turned out that the Polish justice minister asked the constitutional court to check whether EU law was compatible with the Polish constitution, triggering anger among Poland's generally pro-EU voters.
His comments helped independent and liberal candidates to win most mayoral posts in Polish cities and towns, limiting the overall scale of PiS's gains in the local elections.
Tusk said those results served as a ""big warning"" for PiS.
He declined to say whether he planned to return to domestic politics when his mandate at the European Council expires in late 2019.
Poland faces a parliamentary election next autumn. Poland will also vote along with other EU member states next May for a new European Parliament.
Since sweeping to power in 2015, PiS has remained broadly popular, benefiting from voter-pleasing welfare reforms, nationalist rhetoric and strong economic growth.

But critics at home and abroad have accused it of a tilt toward authoritarian rule after moves to increase government control over the judiciary and state media that have also fueled Poland's isolation within the EU.

1681,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>",EU left rallies behind Timmermans for election as Sefcovic bows out,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's deputy chief executive Frans Timmermans will lead the center-left campaign in May's EU parliamentary election, the party said on Monday, after fellow commissioner Maros Sefcovic stepped aside.
Sefcovic, who is vice president for energy on the European Commission, said he endorsed Timmermans, the executive's first vice president, in his bid to succeed Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker next year.
Sefcovic, from Slovakia, said he stood down in the interests of party unity, avoiding a need for the Party of European Socialists to vote on who will lead its campaign.
Timmermans, a former Dutch foreign minister, promises to bring the EU closer to ordinary voters at a time when Britain's pending exit is inspiring other nationalist movements to challenge European integration.
Monday's announcement came three days before the center-right European People's Party votes at a Helsinki convention to choose its lead candidate for May's vote. They are widely expected to back Manfred Weber, the party's German leader in the European Parliament, over ex-Finnish premier Alexander Stubb.
The parliament says that Juncker's successor must be the lead candidate, or Spitzenkandidat in German, from a winning party. But many national leaders, who will nominate the next head of the Commission after May's vote, say they reserve the right to put forward anyone they like for parliament's approval.
That leaves it unclear how the battle for the EU's top job will play out. Conservative French Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier or centrist allies of French President Emmanuel Macron, such as Danish EU commissioner Margrethe Vestager, are also cited as contenders. There is even speculation on German Chancellor Angela Merkel as a dark horse, notably since she announced last week that she will not seek re-election.

National polls suggest that the EPP will remain the biggest party in the EU legislature, followed by the center-left. But their informal ""grand coalition"" may well fall short of a majority, giving more influence to greens or centrists, as well as to growing anti-EU nationalist groups.

1682,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 11:40AM ET</span>","Back from the wilderness, Merz leads race to succeed Merkel","By Paul Carrel
BERLIN (Reuters) - Businessman Friedrich Merz, back from the political wilderness, is taking an early lead in the race to succeed Angela Merkel as leader of Germany's Christian Democrats (CDU) and secure the chance of running for chancellor - possibly even next year.
Merz was pushed out of his role as CDU parliamentary leader by Merkel in 2002 - a move that cemented her grip on the party on her way to becoming chancellor in 2005. Now, his bid for power - if successful - could precipitate her demise.
Merz has been out of the Bundestag since 2009, but retained a close and influential network of CDU contacts while pursuing a successful business career. The run-up to his jump back into frontline politics was long, well-timed and well-supported.
Aged 62, he is less than two years younger than Merkel but presents himself as the candidate of the future, drawing on the best of the past. He is widely known for a proposal to simplify the annual tax return so that it could be written on a beer mat.
""We need a re-awakening and renewal,"" Merz told reporters in Berlin last Wednesday when setting out his stall.
""I am a convinced economic liberal, a social conservative and a socially engaged person,"" he said, hitting the buttons that fire up CDU members, many of whom have become uneasy with Merkel's centrist approach during her 13 years as chancellor.
One CDU lawmaker, yet to be convinced of Merz, described his pitch as ""back to the roots"" - a socially conservative, pro-business appeal to the party's core of western, Catholic men who see Merkel - a Protestant woman from the east - as an anomaly.
So far, the right-wing pitch is working.
Polls show voters believe Merz is better placed to lead the conservatives than the other two declared candidates - CDU Secretary General Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, and Health Minister Jens Spahn.
HELPING HANDS
Merz, who was the first to throw his hat into the ring last Monday after news leaked that Merkel would not run again as CDU leader in December, had help from within the party.
Wolfgang Schaeuble, president of parliament and one of the most CDU senior politicians, backed Merz's bid for the party chair and helped open doors for him, weekly magazine Der Spiegel reported.
Merz is close to Armin Laschet, CDU leader in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW). With NRW contributing almost a third of the 1,001 delegates who will vote on the CDU leadership at a party congress in early December, Laschet's support could prove crucial.
In business too, Merz has a strong network. A trained lawyer, he holds numerous non-executive company board positions, including chairman of the German arm of the U.S. hedge fund BlackRock, for whom he has helped open doors.
""He was very good at initiating talks with potential customers,"" said an industry source who knows Merz personally.
Another person who knows Merz said he was quick on the uptake, unpretentious and engaging with both executives and workers lower down the corporate hierarchy.
With that common touch, Merz began building momentum for his comeback a year ago, when media reported he told CDU members in Duesseldorf: ""The strategy of putting all voters across the aisle into a coma should have come to an end.""
That was a dig at Merkel, who is renowned for a strategy of ""asymmetric demobilization"" - or persuading opposition voters to stay at home while rallying her own supporters.
Merz wants to win support with more of a vision, including a more detailed response to French President Emmanuel Macron's proposals for deepening European integration.
Late last month, before announcing his run for the CDU leadership, Merz co-wrote an article calling for Germany to take ""bold steps ... to make the economic and monetary union stronger"".
HURDLE
Kramp-Karrenbauer poses the biggest hurdle to Merz securing the CDU leadership. A Merkel protege, she has the advantage of having won an election - albeit in the small western state of Saarland - and served successfully as state premier there.
""She has an ability to bring the different wings and interests of the CDU together,"" said one senior CDU official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
As heir to Merkel's centrist cause, she could probably cohabit as party leader with Merkel as chancellor, which she wants to keep until the end of the parliamentary term in 2021.
Such an arrangement would prove difficult with Merz as party leader, given his past rivalry with Merkel. The upshot could be early elections in 2019, especially as the Social Democrats are unsure they want to remain in Merkel's ruling coalition.
In an election, Merz's right-wing pitch could draw back some CDU voters from the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD), though shifting to the right has not worked for the Bavarian CSU or France's conservatives.
Kramp-Karrenbauer is more likely to be able to form a coalition with the rising force in German politics - the Greens, now the second-strongest party.

""He is highly respected,"" the first CDU politician said of Merz. ""But it is respect grounded in the past ... The art now is being ready to work with others.""

1683,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>",Host South Sudan to include Darfur rebels in Sudan peace talks,"JUBA (Reuters) - South Sudan will host peace talks in Juba next week between the government of Sudan in Khartoum and all Sudanese opposition armed groups, and will also include rebels from Darfur, a presidential adviser said on Monday.
Sudan, which had previously accused its southern neighbor of stoking unrest in parts of its territory, agreed to mediation by South Sudan on Sunday, although only in its conflicts with rebels in the border regions of South Kordofan and Blue Nile.
Independence for South Sudan in 2011 meant that many previously restive areas escaped Khartoum's rule, except for South Kordofan and Blue Nile, where rebels kept up their fight.
Tut Kew Gatluak, an adviser to President Salva Kiir, said the talks would now also involve rebels in Darfur, a region of Sudan along the border with South Sudan where rebels have been clashing with President Omar Hassan al-Bashir's forces since 2003, although fighting has subsided in all the rebel regions in recent years.
""President (Salva) Kiir has invited all the armed opposition groups present in Sudan, whether in Darfur or in the two states of Blue Nile and South Kordofan, to participate in the talks in Juba,"" he told a news conference.
The Khartoum government has unilaterally maintained a ceasefire with rebels in Darfur, Blue Nile and South Kordofan since 2015, and extended it in July.
Sudan and South Sudan have long traded accusations of supporting rebels in each other's territory, during wars in which hundreds of thousands of people have died.
Kiir's government and South Sudan's main rebel group concluded a peace deal in September in Khartoum, with Bashir's assistance, that was aimed at ending a civil war that had been raging since 2013.
Gatluak said Kiir would play a reciprocal role in the negotiations between Bashir's government and the Sudanese rebels, starting in Juba next week.

Khartoum has said further peace talks under the aegis of the African Union are expected to take place in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, in mid-December.

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - The Pakistani lawyer who helped free a Christian woman sentenced to death for blasphemy said on Monday he had been forced to flee to the Netherlands for his life, and has no idea where his client is.
Lawyer Saiful Mulook, who defended Asia Bibi in a case that has led to the assassination of two Pakistani politicians, said local United Nations staff had urged him to leave the country on Saturday following her acquittal last week.
""I was put on a plane against my wishes,"" Mulook told reporters in The Hague. ""I am not happy to be without her. I would have been much happier if I was in the same place as her. But everybody said I was a prime target.""
Mulook said he did not know whether Bibi had already been released from prison, or where she would want to seek asylum after being acquitted by the Supreme Court on Wednesday.
""Ask the people of the U.N."", Mulook said. ""They are not telling me, for security reasons.""
Bibi was convicted in 2010 for allegedly making derogatory remarks about Islam during an argument with her neighbors, and had been on death row since then.
The court's decision to overturn the verdict led to violent protests throughout Pakistan by angry mobs calling for the judges in the case to be killed. 
Several parties in the Dutch parliament have said they support providing temporary shelter to Bibi if she flees there.
Mulook said Italy had offered asylum to both Bibi and her family and his own family, but that they had not accepted the offer straightaway, as U.N. staff said they would make arrangements. 

Islamists have shut down major cities in Pakistan through days of demonstrations against Bibi's acquittal. They have said they would escalate the protests if she were permitted to leave the country. The government has indicated it will bar her from traveling abroad.

Alain Berset, speaking at a lunch hosted by the Swiss Foreign Correspondents' Association, said the Swiss political system was hard for foreigners to get to grips with. 
""A president who can’t take decisions on his own, and who only holds office for a year? Okay, to some of you that might actually sound like a really good idea,"" said Berset, barely a household name in his own country thanks to the Swiss system of rotating the presidency among government ministers. 
Switzerland's system of direct democracy means it votes on ""pretty much everything,"" he said, with dates in the diary for the next 64 votes and elections up until 2034. 
""I’m not sure whether you can even get that across to your readers at home. Apparently there are countries where just one referendum is enough to plunge the country into years of uncertainty and chaos,"" he said.

U.S. Ambassador Ed McMullen said Berset's remarks were taken in good humor. ""I don’t think he was making a jab at anyone. He was joking,"" McMullen said. ""It was a point about Swiss presidencies and how ironic it is that they change theirs every year. Some like that, some don’t.""

1687,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 10:00AM ET</span>",Explainer: Britain's big Brexit vote - Will parliament back PM May?,"By William James
LONDON (Reuters) - If British Prime Minister Theresa May is able to strike a Brexit deal with the European Union in the coming days or weeks, she will face a crucial vote in parliament when she asks lawmakers to approve it.
How will the vote in parliament work?
WHAT DOES MAY HAVE TO DO? 
If a deal is agreed, May has to publish in parliament a copy of the withdrawal agreement and an outline agreement of Britain's future relationship with the EU.
Ministers must then arrange a debate. In the directly elected lower house of parliament this will culminate in a vote to determine whether parliament has approved the deal. This is the big vote.
The government can move very quickly to organize the vote once a deal is reached, but any debate is expected to last several days.
HOW WILL THE VOTE WORK?
The format of the debate and vote is yet to be decided and currently subject to fierce disagreement. This is because it could have a crucial role in determining whether the government wins the vote.
Ministers argue that any decision by parliament must be unambiguous in endorsing the deal as it is presented by the government. If not, they say the vote might not meet the legal criteria necessary for ratification of the withdrawal agreement. 
But, opponents of May's strategy instead want to use the debate to demonstrate that there is majority support for an alternative exit strategy, such as a second referendum, or remaining inside the EU's customs union.
The way in which they are able to do this will depend on the format. There could be multiple votes which, although not legally binding, would be politically hard to ignore if they show support for an alternative exit arrangement.
A final decision on the format will be made closer to the time by parliamentary officials, based on recommendations from lawmakers. Legislation only stipulates ministers should try to hold a debate before the European Parliament has its own vote. 
WHAT ABOUT THE HOUSE OF LORDS?
The unelected upper house of parliament, the House of Lords, will also debate the deal, but will only be asked to ""take note"" of it. The Lords will not get a straight ""approve"" or ""reject"" vote, and will not have the power to block the deal.
The legislation defining the procedure for parliamentary approval does not specify how quickly after a deal is announced the vote will happen. 
WHAT WILL LAWMAKERS VOTE ON?
Lawmakers will be voting on whether to approve a package consisting of:
1) The withdrawal agreement - a legal text setting out issues such as citizens' rights, the financial settlement, a backstop for the Irish border, and the terms of an implementation period designed to smooth the exit process.
2) The future relationship framework - a non-legal document defining how Britain and the EU will work together in the long term on issues such as trade and security. 
These two documents define the deal May and her team have been negotiating with the European Commission since June 2017.
WHO GETS TO VOTE?
There are 650 elected lawmakers in Britain's House of Commons. Excluding non-voting members such as the speaker and others who never take up their seats, around 320 votes are needed to be certain of winning a vote. The actual number needed for victory depends on abstentions and absences on the day.
The vote is decided by a simple majority. Whichever side has more votes wins. 
HOW WILL THE RESULT BE ANNOUNCED?
At the end of the debate, the speaker will typically ask for those in favor of the motion to shout ""aye"", and then those against to say ""no"". As long as some lawmakers shout ""no"", the speaker will call for a formal vote, known as a division.
Votes are registered by lawmakers walking through different doorways, out of sight of television cameras and onlookers. Once the headcount is complete - which can take up to 15 minutes - lawmakers return to the debating chamber.
Four appointed tellers will assemble in front of the speaker, and one will read the result out loud. 
HOW WILL THE PARTIES VOTE?
The ruling Conservative Party has 315 lawmakers. It governs with a working majority of 13 thanks to a deal with the 10 lawmakers of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).
But May's party is not united behind her current plan. Eurosceptics think it leaves Britain too tied to EU rules, and pro-EU lawmakers say the ties are not close enough. Both groups are potentially large enough to inflict defeat.
The support of the 10 DUP lawmakers is dependent on the solution agreed on the Irish border. They have said they will not support any deal that leaves Northern Ireland subject to different rules to the rest of the country.
The opposition Labour Party has 257 lawmakers. Led by Jeremy Corbyn, the party has pledged to vote down any deal that does not meet its criteria. The plans currently under discussion are unlikely to do this, so most Labour lawmakers can be expected to vote against May.
However, some who disagree with Corbyn's stance could rebel and vote with the government in order to avoid the risk of leaving without a deal. Media reports have said May is courting these Labour ""moderates"".
The Scottish National Party's 35 lawmakers are expected to vote against the government deal, as are the 12 Liberal Democrats.
IF MAY WINS, IS THAT IT?
No. Although the vote is the focal point for resistance to the deal, the government is also required to pass separate legislation to implement the withdrawal agreement and complete the ratification process.
This legislation will be known as the EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill. It will be subject to full scrutiny in parliament, involving multiple rounds of possible amending and voting. It has to be passed before March 29, 2019.
This process is unlikely to be used to unpick the deal as the legislation will be implementing what has already been approved by parliament. However, if parliament feels as if May has ignored its wishes and is forcing the deal through, it could use the bill to stall the exit process.
WHAT IF MAY LOSES?
This would be a politically explosive outcome that could topple May and her government. There are legislative guidelines on what happens next, but they could be overtaken by events.
By law, if the government motion is rejected, ministers have 21 days to set out in a statement how they intend to proceed. The government has said that if their deal is rejected, Britain will leave the EU without a deal.
It then has to call a fresh debate in parliament that could give lawmakers another chance to set out amendments - effectively giving parliament a vote on an alternative path. These amendments would not be binding, but if approved May would again find them hard to ignore.

However, it is also technically possible that the government could call a second vote in the commons and ask lawmakers for their approval again on either the same, or amended terms.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis called on Monday for the eradication of anti-Semitism following an increase in attacks and hate crimes against Jews in several countries and said it was vital to preserve the memory of the Holocaust.
In the worst attack ever against U.S. Jews, a gunman yelling ""All Jews must die"" stormed a Pittsburgh synagogue on Oct. 27, killing 11 worshippers and wounding six other people including four police officers, before he was arrested.
""We are called to commit ourselves to ensure anti-Semitism is banned from the human community,"" Francis said during a meeting with rabbis from the World Congress of Mountain Jews.
Mountain Jews are the descendants of Jews who left ancient Persia and settled in the Caucasus.
Francis said the Holocaust, in which the Nazis murdered six million Jews around Europe during World War Two, must continue to be commemorated to keep its memory alive.
""Without a living memory, there will be no future, for if the darkest pages of history do not teach us to avoid the same errors, human dignity will remain a dead letter,"" he said.
He noted the recent 75th anniversary of the deportation of Rome's Jews by Nazi occupiers and that Nov. 9 will be the 80th anniversary of ""Kristallnacht,"" the night when mobs ransacked thousands of synagogues and Jewish businesses in Germany and Austria.
""Sadly, anti-Semitic attitudes are also present in our own times. As I have often repeated, a Christian cannot be an anti-Semite, we share the same roots,"" Francis said, stressing the importance of inter-faith dialogue.
In the run-up to Tuesday's contentious U.S. elections, in which immigration has become a central issue, racist fliers have been reported on university campuses in at least five states, while synagogues in New York and California have been sprayed with anti-Semitic graffiti.

Last week British police launched an investigation into alleged anti-Semitic hate crimes within the opposition Labour Party, after a report that Labour itself had found evidence of party members threatening politicians.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The outgoing commander of American troops in South Korea voiced support on Monday for controversial measures to reduce military activity along the border with North Korea, as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo prepared for talks with North Korean officials on denuclearization and plans for a second leaders' summit.
Writing in a South Korean military publication, U.S. General Vincent Brooks said recent steps by South and North Korea to disarm areas along the so-called demilitarized zone between the two nations have ""the support and agreement of the United States.""
Last week a no-fly zone went into effect along the border, despite private concerns by U.S. officials that the move could restrict training and the ability to monitor the border. Other steps included disarming some areas of the border and removing some landmines and guard posts.
""Together, these activities demonstrate a shared commitment to positive action and work to develop the trust essential to the next steps along the road to a lasting and stable peace,"" Brooks wrote.
Pompeo previously expressed ""discontent"" with the deal that created the no-fly zone, which South Korean sources said became a key sticking point for the United States because it would effectively prevent close air support drills.
Brooks' comments came as U.S. and South Korean marines conducted military drills under the Korean Marine Exchange Program for the first time in months, according to the South Korean ministry of defense.
The exercises were among the training drills indefinitely suspended in June after U.S. President Donald Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore and promised to end U.S.-South Korea military exercises.
Although larger exercises were suspended, the two countries have continued small-scale drills, the South's Ministry of National Defence said on Monday, adding that the marines were holding a training round near the southern city of Pohang. 
Pompeo, interviewed on broadcaster CBS's ""Face the Nation"" program said on Sunday he would be in New York at the end of this week to meet his North Korean counterpart, Kim Yong Chol.
""I expect we'll make some real progress, including an effort to make sure that the summit between our two leaders can take place, where we can make substantial steps towards denuclearization,"" he added.
North Korea has not tested a ballistic missile or nuclear weapon for nearly a year, and has said it has shuttered its main nuclear test site and plans to dismantle several more facilities.
In recent weeks, North Korea has pressed harder for what it sees as reciprocal concessions by the United States and other countries.
Over the weekend, Kim hosted President Miguel Diaz-Canel of Cuba - another country under U.S. sanctions - during a lavish visit in Pyongyang, where the two leaders vowed to boost their cooperation.
During a banquet on Sunday, Kim said the ""two countries are in the same trench in the struggle for defending sovereignty and dignity of their countries and safeguarding international justice,"" according to a state media report.
Diaz-Canel, meanwhile, ""voiced his will to meet all challenges by the hostile forces"" alongside North Korea, according to the report.
'NO ECONOMIC RELIEF'
On Friday North Korea warned that it could resume development of its nuclear program if the United States did not drop its campaign of ""maximum pressure"" and sanctions. 
""The improvement of relations and sanctions are incompatible,"" a foreign ministry official said in a statement released through state-run KCNA news agency.
""The U.S. thinks that its oft-repeated 'sanctions and pressure' lead to 'denuclearization.' We cannot help laughing at such a foolish idea."" 
South Korea hopes the North and the United States will make ""big progress"" during the talks set for this week, presidential spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom said on Monday, but declined to comment on the North's Friday statement.
American officials have remained skeptical of Kim's commitment to give up his nuclear arsenal, however, and Washington says it will not support easing international sanctions until more verified progress is made.
Pompeo, interviewed on television's ""Fox News Sunday,"" said the Trump administration wants a full, verifiable denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, adding that Trump insisted on ""no economic relief until we have achieved our ultimate objective.""
South Korean President Moon Jae-in's continuing efforts to engage with North Korea have fanned U.S. concerns that Seoul could weaken pressure on North Korea to give up nuclear weapons.
In Washington last week, South Korea's defense minister said the two countries would decide by December on major joint military exercises for 2019. Vigilant Ace, suspended this month, is one of several such exercises halted to encourage dialogue with Pyongyang, which has criticized joint U.S.-South Korea exercises in the past.

The biggest combat-readiness war game ever staged in and around Japan has gone ahead, however, with nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan joining Japanese destroyers and a Canadian warship in the ocean off Japan, another key player in the effort to pressure North Korea.

DEGANIA DAM, Israel (Reuters) - Some 2,000 years ago, Jesus walked across the Sea of Galilee, according to the Bible. Today, that doesn't require a miracle.
Long periods of drought and over-pumping have brought the lake low. A reedy island has materialized at its southern edge, and will soon be a peninsula. Holiday-makers and fishermen teeter over expanding boggy beaches to reach the waterline.
The depletion imperils Israel's biggest reservoir, starving the River Jordan and Dead Sea. It also diminishes a landmark that rivals Jerusalem as a major draw for Christian pilgrims.
Israel sees a solution in desalination, in which it is a world leader. It plans to double the amount of Mediterranean seawater it processes and pipe half of it 75 kilometers (47 miles) to the Galilee. 
""We are doing this in order to save our nature, to fight global warming, to prevent the effect, the devastating effect, of global warming on the Sea of Galilee, and also to create a very significant water storage for the State of Israel,"" Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz, who holds the cabinet water portfolio, told Reuters.
Noting the lake's significance to Christians given the Gospel accounts of Jesus' miracle-working there, Steinitz joked: ""If he is coming back, we will make sure that he will have to make a real effort to walk on the water once more."" 
Environmentalists welcome the move. Last full in 2004, the Galilee has dropped six meters (18 feet). It may be just weeks away from hitting a ""black line"" - 214.87 meters below global sea level - where it risk permanent contamination and pressure change from sediment.
Israelis hope winter rains will hold that off until the first desalinated water is piped in, next year.
PRESSURE 
Preserving the lake would free Israel to offer Jordan more water under a 1994 peace treaty.
""If there is irreversible damage done to the Sea of Galilee, to the Jordan, to this whole ecosystem, Israel's enemies could use it against her,"" said David Parsons, vice president of the International Christian Embassy in Jerusalem, which oversees evangelical outreach to Israel.
""It could also affect Christian tourism to the land. It's very good to see Israel taking responsible steps now to address this, finally.""
Israel's plan provides for piping in 120 million cubic meters annually. Steinitz hopes to see that almost tripled in a cabinet vote next month. Such capacity, he said, would replenish the Galilee by 2026. 
He predicted a small bump to consumers' water tariffs, to help defray the $622 million infrastructure cost. 
Still, with a national election due in 2019 and an unusually wet winter looming, some worry the Galilee could be again neglected.
""The vulnerability of this program is that the Water Authority has to continue to commit to maximizing desalination production,"" said Gidon Bromberg, Israel director for the environmental group EcoPeace/Friends of the Earth Middle East. ""And that is a commitment that could change every year.""
The authority's director, Giora Shaham, sounded reassuring.
""We need this water, not only for us but also for the Jordanians, because they are in very, very tough conditions now from the water problem point of view,"" he said.

ACCRA (Reuters) - Prince Charles acknowledged Britain's role in the slave trade on Monday calling it an appalling atrocity that had ""left an indelible stain on the history of our world"".
In a speech in Ghana, which served as a major hub where African slaves were held before being shipped away, most across the Atlantic, the heir-to-the-British throne said the ""profound injustice"" of the past could never be forgotten.
""At Osu Castle on Saturday, it was especially important to me – as indeed it was on my first visit there forty-one years ago – that I should acknowledge the most painful chapter of Ghana’s relations with the nations of Europe, including the United Kingdom,"" Charles said.
""The appalling atrocity of the slave trade, and the unimaginable suffering it caused, left an indelible stain on the history of our world."" 
Britain abolished the trans-Atlantic slave trade in 1807 although the full abolition of slavery did not follow for another generation. 
Two days ago the prince visited Christiansborg Castle in Osu which originally operated as a Danish slave trade fort and from where it is estimated more than 1.5 million Africans were traded.
The castle later became the seat of the Ghanaian Government after the country's independence from Britain in 1957. 
""While Britain can be proud that it later led the way in the abolition of this shameful trade, we have a shared responsibility to ensure that the abject horror of slavery is never forgotten,"" Charles said in his speech.
The prince and his wife Camilla are on the second leg of a tour of three African nations, having already visited Gambia, which he congratulated for turning its back on autocratic rule and returning to the Commonwealth, before he heads to Nigeria on Tuesday.
In his speech in Accra, Charles, who earlier this year was approved as successor to his 92-year-oldmother Queen Elizabeth as head of the Commonwealth, spoke of the role the loose alliance of 53 member-states could play in tackling climate change, a key campaigning issue of the prince.
""In such an uncertain and changing world, none of us can know what kind of a planet our grandchildren, and great grandchildren, will inhabit, but the Commonwealth ... offers us a vital mechanism to help ensure that it is not poisoned and polluted and that its vitality is not compromised,"" he said.

The royals will conclude their tour a week before Charles celebrates his 70th birthday on Nov. 14.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia told the United Nations on Monday it would prosecute those responsible for the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at its Istanbul consulate, as Western states pressed it for a credible investigation.
Bandar Al Aiban, the head of the Saudi government delegation at the first U.N. review of the kingdom's record in five years, heard calls from more than 40 nations, including the United States, for a thorough inquiry and a string of rights reforms.
He told the hearing that King Salman had instructed the Saudi public prosecutor to ""proceed with the investigation into this case according to the applicable laws"" with a view to establishing the facts and ""bringing all the perpetrators to justice"".
""As regards the passing of citizen Khashoggi, our country is committed to carrying out a fair investigation and all persons involved with that crime will be prosecuted in the justice system,"" Aiban said at the end of the half-day session. 
Aiban gave no details on the status or whereabouts of the 18 Saudi nationals detained in connection with the case and repeatedly declined to answer journalists' questions about them, saying: ""The case is still under investigation, as you know...I think my statement was very clear.""
Khashoggi's sons on Monday demanded the return of the body of the Washington Post columnist and critic of the Saudi government, who disappeared at the consulate on Oct. 2.
Saudi officials initially insisted Khashoggi had left the consulate, then said he died in an unplanned ""rogue operation"". The kingdom's public prosecutor Saud al-Mojeb later said he was killed in a premeditated attack.
""We condemn this premeditated killing,"" U.S. charge d'affaires Mark Cassayre told the Geneva talks.
""A thorough, conclusive and transparent investigation carried out in accordance with due process with results made public is essential,"" he said.
""ARBITRARY ARRESTS""
Many Western delegations called on Riyadh to abolish the death penalty and the system of male guardianship over women, and to narrow the definition of ""terrorism"" in law so that peaceful critics are not prosecuted.
France's ambassador Francois Rivasseau called on Saudi Arabia to ""immediate halt imprisonment and arbitrary arrests"" of journalists and activists, and to guarantee freedom of religion.
The Saudi delegation is due to report back on Friday on which recommendations from states it has accepted.
Aiban, who is president of the official Human Rights Commission of Saudi Arabia, said the kingdom was constantly striving to promote and protect human rights ""driven by the honorable principles and provisions of Islamic sharia and the traditional values of our society.""
Freedom of opinion and expression were guaranteed, but was limited by laws that protect the rights of others as well as the ""prerequisites of national security and public order"", he said.
Women had seen a series of reforms over the last five years, Aiban added. Women were allowed to vote and stand as candidates in municipal councils and driving licenses have been issued to women since June.
No Arab country raised the Khashoggi case. 

Egypt's ambassador Alaa Youssef praised Saudi Arabia's efforts to confront terrorism and radicalism, while Kuwait welcomed its creation of training centers for judges.

Rights groups say the May 2017 law effectively bans their work and makes it harder for charities to operate. Officials have said it is necessary, arguing that foreign-funded NGOs threaten national security.
Responding to a request from a participant in a youth forum in the Red Sea city of Sharm al-Sheikh on Sunday to revisit the NGO law, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said: ""I agree with you. I believe in the work done by civil society organizations.""
""The law contained phobia and a fear of these organizations for Egypt,"" he added.
""I want to reassure those who are listening to me inside Egypt and outside of Egypt, that in Egypt, we are keen that the law becomes balanced and achieves what is required of it to regulate the work of these groups in a good way. This is not just political talk,"" Sisi said.
The measure restricts NGO activity to development and social work and brought in jail terms of up to five years for violation.
Sisi said the government was dissatisfied with the law when it was issued last year and he had opted not to actively enforce it, ""in the hope that we can move to redraft it.""
While critics have said that the law mainly targets rights groups, even apolitical charities have complained it restricts them at a time when subsidy cuts and tax increases have made it harder for Egyptians to make ends meet.
Charities have long played an important role in feeding, clothing and providing healthcare and education in a country where millions live on less than $2 a day.
Under the law, donations exceeding 10,000 Egyptian pounds ($560) must be pre-approved. If no approval is granted within 60 days the request is automatically denied. Failure to inform authorities could result in jail terms of up to five years and fines of up to 1 million Egyptian pounds ($56,000).
Gamal Eid, founder and director of the Arab Network for Human Rights Information, expressed scepticism over Sisi's seriousness in amending the law.
""If the calls for an independent civil society from abroad ease, he will not amend the law,"" Eid said, adding that the government did not respect civil society in Egypt.

This followed comments from another official last week that Iran had uncovered a new generation of Stuxnet, a virus which was used against the country's nuclear program more than a decade ago.
""The Zionist regime (Israel), with its record of using cyber weapons such as Stuxnet computer virus, launched a cyber attack on Iran on Monday to harm Iran's communication infrastructures,"" Telecommunications Minister Mohammad Javad Azari-Jahromi said.
""Thanks to our vigilant technical teams, it failed,"" he said on Twitter. Iran would take legal action against Israel at international bodies, he added, without giving details.
His deputy Hamid Fattahi said more details would be revealed in the coming days, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.
Stuxnet, which is widely believed to have been developed by the United States and Israel, was discovered in 2010 after it was used to attack a uranium enrichment facility at Iran's Natanz underground nuclear site.
It was the first publicly known example of a virus being used to attack industrial machinery.
Last week, Gholamreza Jalali, head of Iran's civil defense agency, said Iran had neutralized a version of Stuxnet.
""Recently we discovered a new generation of Stuxnet which consisted of several parts ... and was trying to enter our systems,"" Jalali was quoted as saying by the semi-official ISNA news agency. He gave no further details.
In 2013, researchers at  Symantec Corp  (NASDAQ:SYMC) uncovered a version of the Stuxnet that was used to attack the Iranian nuclear program in November 2007. 
Tehran agreed under a 2015 deal with world powers to curb the program but President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of it in May, with Israel's backing. Washington fully restored sanctions on Tehran on Monday.

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei last week called for stepped up efforts to fight enemy ""infiltration"" in a speech to officials in charge of cyber defense, state television reported.

Under the judgment, reported by Boel's lawyers on Monday, King Albert II must take the test within three months or risk being presumed to be her father -- although his lawyers could seek to challenge the court's legal argument.
The 84-year-old monarch, who in 2013 abdicated in favor of his son Philippe after 20 years on the throne, has contested Boel's claim for more than a decade. Court-ordered DNA tests have proved that she is not the daughter of Jacques Boel, scion of one of Belgium's richest industrial dynasties.
The court could not be reached, and there was no immediate comment from the royal house. Boel's lawyers said in their statement that they were pleased with the ""strong affirmation of the principle of acting in the interests of the child"" as she seeks legal confirmation of her true identity.
That identity became a topic of public debate after the publication in 1999 of a biography of Queen Paola, Albert's Italian wife, which alleged that he had had a long extra-marital relationship from which a daughter was born in the 1960s.

Albert, who has no formal public role, has acknowledged that he and Paola had marital difficulties. Their three children are all older than Boel. Next in line to the throne is 17-year-old Princess Elisabeth, daughter of Philippe and Queen Mathilde.

PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - The Afghan Taliban will join multilateral peace talks hosted by Russia on Friday, senior Taliban officials said on Tuesday, after the United States and Afghanistan turned down their invitations.
But Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said they had not formally agreed to take part.
Russia invited 12 countries and the Taliban, who are fighting to re-impose strict Islamic law after their 2001 ouster by U.S.-led troops, but the United States and the U.S.-backed Afghan government declined.
Representatives from Iran, China, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan are expected to attend, officials said.
The Moscow talks underline the increasingly active role Russia is playing in Afghanistan, decades after Soviet forces withdrew from the country, with business investment plans, diplomatic and cultural outreach and small military support for the central government.
Afghan President Ashraf Ghani rejected the invitation on the grounds that talks with the Taliban should be led by the Afghan government.
Russia decided to go ahead with the Moscow talks nevertheless, a diplomatic move that has angered Kabul as the meeting could complicate an ongoing U.S.-backed peace process.
A five-member Taliban delegation led by Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanakzai, head of the Taliban's political council in Qatar, will attend.
“The majority of our top leaders showed the willingness to participate in the Moscow peace talks though some of them also expressed their reservations and said it would not give them any benefit on the ground in Afghanistan,” said a Taliban member.
Some Taliban said the delegation would raise their demands for a withdrawal of all foreign forces, the release of all prisoners and the lifting of a ban on travel.
“This is a very good opportunity and we would like to participate and raise our genuine issues,” said another Taliban official. ""We would urge these world powers to help resolve the Afghan issue as per international laws and principles.""
Even though Afghan government officials will not attend the Moscow talks, members of the High Peace Council (HPC), an Afghan body overseeing efforts to start peace talks, are expected to attend.
A U.S. official said the United States believes all countries should support direct dialogue between the government of Afghanistan and the Taliban.
Diplomatic engagement between the Taliban and the United States gained momentum last month after the U.S. special envoy for peace in Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, met Taliban leaders in Qatar.
""We have been clear that no government, including Russia, can be a substitute for the Afghan government in direct negotiations with the Taliban,"" the U.S. official told Reuters.
