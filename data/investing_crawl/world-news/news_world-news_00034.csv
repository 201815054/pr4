AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The International Criminal Court (ICC) ruled on Thursday that it has jurisdiction over alleged deportations of Rohingya people from Myanmar to Bangladesh as a possible crime against humanity.
The decision at the Hague-based court paves the way for prosecutor Fatou Bensouda to further examine whether there is sufficient evidence to file charges in the case, although she has not done so yet.
Bensouda's representatives were not immediately available for comment.
Although Myanmar is not a member of the Hague-based court, Bangladesh is, and the cross-border nature of deportation was sufficient for jurisdiction, the court said.
""The Court has jurisdiction over the crime against humanity of deportation allegedly committed against members of the Rohingya people,"" a three-judge panel said in a written summary of their decision. ""The reason is that an element of this crime - the crossing of a border - took place on the territory of a State party (Bangladesh).""
Myanmar's government spokesman Zaw Htay did not respond to calls seeking comment on the ICC decision, instead sending a text response: ""I can't talk right now.""
The office of government leader Aung San Suu Kyi last month said Myanmar was ""under no obligation to enter into litigation with the prosecutor"", and setting the jurisdiction over the case would ""set a dangerous precedent whereby future populistic causes and complaints against non-State Parties ... may be litigated.""
Bensouda had asked the ICC's judges for a formal opinion on whether the fact that alleged crimes had at least in part happened on the territory of a member state brought them under the court's purview.
However, Thursday's ruling was potentially more expansive than some experts had foreseen.
The judges said: ""The court may also exercise its jurisdiction with regard to any other crime set out in article 5 of the statute, such as the crimes against humanity of persecution and/or other inhumane acts.""
With this decision, the prosecutor ""has no choice but to submit a request"" to open a preliminary examination, University of Amsterdam international law expert Kevin Jon Heller said.
An independent U.N. fact-finding mission in August concluded that Myanmar’s military last year carried out mass killings and gang rapes of Muslim Rohingya with ""genocidal intent"" and the commander-in-chief and five generals should be prosecuted for orchestrating the gravest crimes under law.
About 700,000 Rohingya fled the crackdown and most are now living in refugee camps in Bangladesh.
Myanmar has denied committing atrocities against the Rohingya, saying its military carried out justifiable actions against militants. It has so far signaled it does not intend to cooperate with the international court.

(Reuters) - Beijing expressed anger on Thursday after a British Royal Navy warship sailed close to islands claimed by China in the South China Sea late last month, saying Britain was engaged in ""provocation"" and that it had lodged a strong complaint.
The HMS Albion, a 22,000 ton amphibious warship carrying a contingent of Royal Marines, exercised its ""freedom of navigation"" rights as it passed near the Paracel Islands, two sources, who were familiar with the matter but who asked not to be identified, told Reuters. 
The Albion was on its way to Ho Chi Minh City, where it docked on Monday following a deployment in and around Japan. 
One of the sources said Beijing dispatched a frigate and two helicopters to challenge the British vessel, but both sides remained calm during the encounter.
The other source the Albion did not enter the territorial seas around any features in the hotly disputed region but demonstrated that Britain does not recognize excessive maritime claims around the Paracel Islands. Twelve nautical miles is an internationally recognized territorial limit.
The Paracels are occupied entirely by China but also claimed by Vietnam and Taiwan. 
China's Foreign Ministry, in a faxed statement sent to Reuters, said the ship had entered Chinese territorial waters around the Paracel Islands on Aug. 31 without permission, and the Chinese navy had warned it to leave.
""The relevant actions by the British ship violated Chinese law and relevant international law, and infringed on China's sovereignty. China strongly opposes this and has lodged stern representations with the British side to express strong dissatisfaction,"" the ministry added.
""China strongly urges the British side to immediately stop such provocative actions, to avoid harming the broader picture of bilateral relations and regional peace and stability,"" it said.
""China will continue to take all necessary measures to defend its sovereignty and security.""
The encounter comes at a delicate time in London-Beijing relations. 
Britain has been courting China for a post-Brexit free trade deal, and both countries like to describe how they have a ""golden era"" in ties.
A spokesman for the Royal Navy said: ""HMS Albion exercised her rights for freedom of navigation in full compliance with international law and norms.""
British Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesman said Britain had a strong relationship with China.
FREEDOM OF NAVIGATION
China's claims in the South China Sea, through which some $3 trillion of shipborne trade passes each year, are contested by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. Britain does not have any territorial claims in the area. 
While the U.S. Navy has conducted Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs) in the same area in the past, this British challenge to China's growing control of the strategic waterway comes after the United States has said it would like to see more international participation in such actions. 
Both Britain and the United States say they conduct FONOP operations throughout the world, including in areas claimed by allies.
The British Navy has previously sailed close to the disputed Spratly Islands, further south in the South China Sea, several times in recent years but not within the 12 nautical mile limit, regional diplomatic sources have said.
Singapore-based South China Sea expert Ian Storey said Britain had strong traditional interests in defending freedom of navigation but regular deployments in the South China Sea would be constrained due to limited numbers of warships and onerous demands in other parts of the world.
“The UK’s actions will please Washington as the Trump administration has grumbled that U.S. allies have been remiss in upholding freedom of navigation in the South China Sea,” said Storey, of Singapore’s ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute.
“But China will be displeased as it suggests that U.S. allies are responding to Washington’s appeals... It might also nudge other U.S. allies to make similar moves.”
FONOPs have so far not persuaded Beijing to curtail its South China Sea activities, which have included extensive reclamation of reefs and islands and the construction of runways, hangars and missile systems.
Beijing says it is entitled to build on its territories and says the facilities are for civilian use and necessary self-defense purposes. China blames Washington for militarizing the region with its freedom of navigation patrols.
Foreign aircraft and vessels in the region are routinely challenged by Chinese naval ships and monitoring stations on the fortified islands, sources have said previously.
In April, warships from Australia - which like Britain is a close U.S. ally - had what Canberra described as a close ""encounter"" with Chinese naval vessels in the contested sea.
The Albion is one of three Royal Navy ships deployed to Asia this year, along with HMS Argyll and HMS Sutherland. 
In a speech in Jakarta in August, Foreign Office Minister for Asia and the Pacific Mark Field said Britain was committed to an enduring security presence in Asia and urged countries to respect navigational freedom and international law in the South China Sea.

That law included the ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, whose landmark 2016 judgment criticized Chinese actions in the South China Sea and found no basis for its sweeping historic claims. Beijing has repeatedly rejected the ruling and earlier refused to participate in the case brought by the Philippines.

PARIS (Reuters) - Time is running out for regions on the frontline of trade between Britain and Europe to cope with the impact of a no-deal Brexit, from finding vets to building customs infrastructure, a northern French region's ""ambassador"" to Britain said.
Jean-Paul Mulot of the Hauts-de-France region that is home to Calais, France's busiest passenger port and a major cargo thoroughfare, said the two sides needed focus on finding agreement and stop talking about a no-deal scenario. 
""Hurry up, and above all, avoid a 'no-deal',"" Mulot, who is based in Britain, urged both sides. 
""Today, we're hearing political leaders at the highest level admit that a 'no-deal' is possible, even worth considering,"" he said in an interview with Reuters. ""That's extremely worrying.""
The fortunes of Calais and the wider Hauts-de-France region are closely intertwined with the UK's future trade ties. But with little more than seven months to go until Britain leaves the bloc there is still no agreement on divorce terms or clarity on a new trade relationship. 
Last month, London told British companies trading with the EU they would face a tangle of red tape and possible border delays if there is no exit deal.
Mulot lamented the impact that squabbling inside Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative party was having on the direction of negotiations.
""We need stability,"" he said. ""Otherwise we are going to miss the deadline. The deadline was supposed to be the end of October. We are now talking about December.""
A no-deal or even a 'hard Brexit' would hurt the Calais region.
Some 7,000 trucks go through its ports and the Channel Tunnel rail crossing every day, and a 'hard Brexit' whereby the UK leaves the EU's single market would require building new customs and sanitary infrastructure.
The region has put an option on a plot of land where it plans to build the new infrastructure, which Mulot estimates could cost more than 100 million euros ($116 million). Questions remain as to whether Brussels, Paris or the region would foot the bill.
Building the facilities, including refrigerated warehouses, would take at least 18 months, making a transition period after March 29 necessary, he added.
""Leveling the land alone would take six months. The idea of setting up everything in just three months is impossible,"" he said. ""The transition period for us is crucial.""
While France is hiring extra customs officers, a shortage of veterinarians for livestock checks in the EU is another headache authorities on both sides of the Channel will have to deal with, he said.
""There are many good vets coming from Romania, Bulgaria, but even eastern European countries can't train enough vets to meet the needs,"" Mulot said.
Freight lines coming from Spain and Italy and carrying fresh vegetables to British supermarkets through the Channel Tunnel would also run into difficulties to keep just-in-time delivery habits.
""The repercussion chain goes beyond the Alps and the Pyrenees,"" he said.

4,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2018 12:18PM ET</span>",France says it must use fewer U.S. parts in its weapons systems,"PARIS (Reuters) - France must cut its dependence on U.S. components in its weapons systems to minimize Washington's ability to block its arms exports, its defense minister said on Thursday.
U.S. export control laws can be used to limit European weapons sales if even small components come from U.S. suppliers. That legislation was in place prior to Donald Trump's presidency, but the industry has grown increasingly worried that his administration is acting to halt exports that might have been permitted in the past.
Washington has this year blocked the sale to Egypt of French-made SCALP cruise missiles, which contain a U.S. part.
Without giving specific examples, Defence Minister Florence Parly said France needed to ""gradually wean ourselves off our reliance on a certain number of American parts.""
""We have had trade difficulties linked to the prospects for exports. And we know that these difficulties are linked to strategic questions and often to problems of commercial rivalry,"" she told a small group of journalists.
She was quizzed on the subject in July by parliament's defense committee.
Asked at that time by one lawmaker about the blocked SCALP sale, Parly said: ""We are at the mercy of the Americans.""
Parly said Washington's actions underlined the need to minimize dependence on U.S. parts in the Future Combat Air System (SCAF) project - Europe's next-generation combat jet which France and Germany are taking the lead in developing.
France's Dassault Aviation and European planemaker Airbus have signed a deal to work together on the jet, which is expected to be at the center of a broader weapons system capable of commanding a squadron of drones. 
France's air force uses Reaper drones, built by U.S. firm General Atomics, in its counter-terrorism operations against Islamist militants. Parly said France had needed U.S. congressional approval to arm the drones.
""Is that satisfactory? No. But we don't have any choice,"" she said.

5,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>",Change of Turkish prosecutor in U.S. pastor case may be positive signal: lawyer,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The replacement of the main prosecutor in the trial of an American pastor in Turkey may be a positive change, the lawyer for the clergyman told Reuters on Thursday, though he said it would be wrong to expect it to herald his release.
The case of Andrew Brunson, an evangelical pastor, who has lived in Turkey for decades and is being tried on terrorism charges, has been at the center of a bitter row between NATO allies Washington and Ankara.
The crisis has prompted President Donald Trump to impose sanctions on Turkey and double trade tariffs, exacerbating a slide in Turkey's lira which reverberated across global markets.
After being detained for 21 months, Brunson was moved to house arrest in July with a travel ban. If found guilty, he could be jailed for up to 35 years. He denies the charges.
On Wednesday, the main prosecutor who has prepared the case against Brunson was removed from the case. No explanation was provided, although changes of judges or prosecutors mid-case are not uncommon in Turkey.
""The prosecutor has had a negative impact on the direction of the trial,"" Ismail Cem Halavurt, Brunson's lawyer said. ""He has constantly added fresh testimonies from anonymous witnesses who had nothing to do with my client,"" he said.
""Now his removal might be a sign that the will about this case is changing,"" he said, but added: ""It is not right to say that he might be freed based on this development. We will have to wait and see.""
While Turkish prosecutors are frequently replaced half way through a trial, the move has attracted attention given the high stakes in the case.
Washington has turned the Brunson affair, one of several disputes it has with Turkey, into the central issue to be resolved as a condition to improve relations.
President Tayyip Erdogan linked the cleric's release to Turkey's demand for Washington to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a Pennsylvania-based imam and former AKP ally who Turkey says was behind the abortive putsch of July 2016. He denies the accusation.
Trump last month demanded the unconditional release of Brunson, calling him a ""great patriot hostage"", after the collapse of a deal that might have freed him.
Ankara has repeatedly said the case must be decided by the courts, slamming what it said was the United States' disregard for Turkey's legal process. Brunson's next hearing is scheduled for Oct. 12.

6,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2018 11:40AM ET</span>","Turkey offers cash, promises passports to families of Syria rebels killed in Afrin","By Khalil Ashawi
AL-BAB, Syria (Reuters) - Turkey is compensating the families of Syrian rebels who died fighting in support of its offensive in Syria's Afrin, promising them citizenship and a house in Turkey, a rebel commander and families said.
The move further escalates Turkey's role in the de facto buffer zone it has carved out in northwest Syria. It points to Ankara's growing entanglement as its forces spread across that arc, with long-term implications for their Syrian allies. 
The Turkish military pushed into the northwest in two offensives. The first, ""Euphrates Shield"" in 2016, drove Islamic State from territory along the border. 
The second, ""Olive Branch"", wrestled the nearby Afrin region from the hands of Syrian Kurdish forces this spring.
Lieutenant Abdallah Halawa, commander of the Hamza Brigade rebels, said the family of each fighter killed in Afrin was getting 60,000 Turkish Lira ($9,142.02).
Relatives of 65 men from his faction have already been compensated. They will get housing and citizenship in Turkey, he told Reuters. 
""It does not compare to what they sacrificed but, to the best of our abilities, it's about honoring them.""
Injured rebels will also later receive 15,000 Turkish Lira each, and may get up to 30,000 if disabled. 
Turkish security sources could not immediately be reached for comment. 
Turkey was long a key backer of rebels who fought President Bashar al-Assad in Syria's war. Its focus shifted in recent years to mending ties with his ally Russia and curbing the power of the Kurdish YPG militia. 
U.S. support for the YPG has infuriated Turkey, which sees it as an extension of the outlawed Kurdish PKK movement that has waged a decades-long insurgency inside Turkey.
Kurdish authorities in northern Syria see Turkey as an invader. Ankara has repeatedly denied their allegations of human rights violations in its Afrin operation.
The United Nations has said after the offensive that more than 134,000 people remained displaced in harsh conditions in a cluster of towns nearby. 
'DEFENDING THIS LAND'
Halawa said the Afrin battle marked the first time rebels received such compensation. ""We have no supporters of the Syrian revolution left except for the Turkish brothers."" 
He said there could soon be similar plans for those who battled Islamic State nearly two years ago, seizing the wide strip between the towns of Azaz and Jarablus. 
Syrian rebel authorities have sought to develop an administration there, as Turkey helps with reconstruction, funds schools, and trains police. 
The northwest corner now remains Syria's last major rebel stronghold. Assad calls the Turkish forces illegal occupiers and has vowed to recover ""every inch"" of the country. 
Relatives of three rebels who fought in Afrin said that after they got 60,000 Turkish Lira, officials recently called them in to a border town to submit fingerprints and documents. 
""We were promised citizenship and a house on Turkish soil,"" said Maamoun Shaaban, whose 19-year-old son was killed. ""The Turkish brothers have spared no effort to help us.""
Shaaban, 51, and three other sons have all fought across the northwest as part of the Ahrar al-Sharqia faction.
He said his wife and small kids might move but he would stay in Syria if they get Turkish passports. ""And if there are coming battles, we stand ready, my sons and I, even if we're all martyred for defending this land.""
Malak al-Sweid, 30, said she would likely move to Turkey when she becomes a citizen. 
She continues to receive her late husband's salary, around 500 Turkish Lira, from the Hamza Brigade. When he died in a landmine blast in Afrin, she worried about providing for their six-year-old son. 
For Ibrahim Jenbod, who works in construction and lost his 20-year-old son, the Turkish cash was ""salvation"" after the family fell into debt. 
""They told us the (citizenship) procedure is underway,"" said Jenbod, who keeps his son's military hat and boots in the living room. ""It's hard going through the loss, I can't forget my boy day and night.""

Hadramout Governor Salmeen al-Bahseeni made the threat in a speech broadcast by the regional radio station based in the provincial capital Mukalla.
Hadramout produces about 100,000 barrels per day (bpd), accounting for about half of Yemen's total oil production. 
United Arab Emirates (UAE)-backed southern Yemeni separatists control most southern provinces, including Hadramout, and have been at odds with the Saudi-based president Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.
Yemen is a small producer with proven oil reserves of around 3 billion barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). The country produced about 500,000 bpd before the civil war that broke out in 2014. 
South Yemen has been rocked by violent protests in the last two weeks after the Yemeni rial lost more than half its value against the U.S. dollar since the start of a civil war in 2015. 
Al-Bahseeni and other southern officials back the protesters and accuse Hadi's government of mismanagement.

9,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2018 11:30AM ET</span>","Kosovo, Serbia consider a land swap, an idea that divides the Balkans","By Fatos Bytyci and Ivana Sekularac
BUJANOVAC, Serbia (Reuters) - Shaip Kamberi, the mayor of Serbia's municipality of Bujanovac, will start living a long-time dream if Serbia reaches an agreement to swap some of its territory with neighboring Kosovo.
The agreement would make Kamberi's town and two other Serbian municipalities, Medvedja and Presevo, part of Kosovo -- something the ethnic Albanians who predominate in the region voted for back in 1992.
""All Albanians dreamed that this will happen one day,"" Kamberi said. ""It was never so close.""
In exchange, Serbia would take over part of northern Kosovo populated mainly by Serbs. The leaders of both countries will meet on Friday in Brussels, and they're expected to discuss the proposed swap for the first time officially.
The idea was first floated by Serbian officials, among them the defense minister and foreign minister. Kosovo President Hashim Thaci then took it up and said he would discuss it with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic in Brussels.
The proposal has divided the European Union. Friday's meeting will be hosted by Federica Mogherini, the European Union's foreign policy chief, who has not dismissed the idea. But German officials said it would open old wounds in a region still scarred by the ethnic conflicts in the 1990s.
In the Balkan region itself, proponents say the exchange would help resolve the conflicts between the two countries, almost 20 years after a bombing campaign by NATO helped end a Serbian war against insurgents in Kosovo, then part of its territory.
But opponents say it would validate a cause of the fighting throughout the Balkans in the 1990s -- so-called ethnic cleansing, the expulsion of populations who did not belong to the main ethnic group of the region where they happened to live.
""Of course, we will look into it properly,"" said an EU official who declined to be named. ""We don’t want to endorse anything that could prove dysfunctional or sow any seeds of more conflict in the future. But it’s not like we would strike it down if both sides there are firmly behind an agreement.""
Vucic is due to visit Kosovo this weekend to explain the implications of a potential deal to Serbs living there. 
""It is important to use this momentum to reach a deal,"" Thaci told a civil society conference on Wednesday. 
HASTY SOLUTIONS
Serbia lost control of Kosovo in 1999, after NATO's campaign to halt the killing of ethnic Albanians in a two-year counter-insurgency war. Ten years after declaring independence, Kosovo is recognized by more than 100 states, including 22 EU members, although Serbia still claims it as part of its state.
The two countries in 2013 committed to an EU-sponsored dialogue to resolve all remaining issues, but little progress has been made since then. 
The deal between the two countries is aimed at mutual recognition. It would eventually lead to Kosovo's membership in the United Nations, a move currently vetoed by Serbia's historical ally, Russia. 
But an agreement would also cement ""ethnic cleansing"", said Father Sava Janjic of the 14th century Serbian Orthodox Church monastery Visoki Decani in Kosovo. 
""Hasty solution will open a series of new problems in the same way that hasty decisions in the 1990s contributed to opening of the Pandora's box of bloody nationalist conflicts,"" he told Reuters in an email. ""It will not stabilize the Balkans -- it will only open new wounds.""
PLEASE RECONSIDER
A group of activists calling themselves Citizens and Friends of the Balkans against Partition/Land Swap wrote an open letter warning about possible effect of the deal.
""We implore the EU, its member states, and the United States to reconsider their position on such a return to ethnification of polities and frontiers,"" the letter said. 
Florian Bieber, one of the signatories of the letter and a Balkans expert at the University of Graz in Austria, told Reuters such an agreement could motivate Bosnian Serb nationalists to seek splitting off their region from the rest of Bosnia.
Serbs account for only four percent of Kosovo's 1.8 million population. Most of them live north of the Ibar River in an area bordering Serbia, which would go to Belgrade. But thousands would remain in southern Kosovo, in the territory to be controlled by Pristina. 
""Anything that resolves the Kosovo-Serbia status dispute is a good thing,"" said Marko Prelec of the Central European University in Budapest. 
""It could calm tension by showing that it is possible for two political leaders who have previously been sharply at odds to reach some common ground,"" Prelec said.

Martin Griffiths, the U.N. Special Envoy for Yemen, said in a statement that he had discussed confidence-building measures with Yemen's foreign minister Khaled al-Yamani. He later returned to the same Geneva hotel ahead of a key government meeting with Arab ambassadors.
But with the Houthi delegation yet to arrive, Griffiths called for the Iranian-allied group to attend the talks, aimed at relaunching peace negotiations after nearly three years.
Griffiths conceded there were ""challenges"" in bringing the parties together in the Swiss city, but still wanted to see the delegation from the Houthi-held capital of Sanaa arrive.
The world body wants the Yemeni government, which is backed by a Saudi-led coalition of Sunni Muslim Arab states, and the Houthi movement to work toward a deal to end the war, remove foreign forces from Yemeni territory, and establish a national unity government.
Griffiths thanked the government for its ""positive engagement"" and acknowledged the coalition's efforts to help convene the consultations.
An inclusive political solution was required to end the conflict in Yemen, where people live in dire humanitarian, economic and security conditions, he said.
The Houthi movement's al-Masirah TV reported on Wednesday that the coalition had prevented the Houthi delegation from flying from Sanaa to Geneva. The Houthis have accused the U.N. of not keeping a promise to transport wounded on the flight. 
On Thursday, a source from Sanaa airport said there was no plane there yet for the Houthi delegation.
Hamza al-Kamali, Yemeni deputy minister for youth, told reporters in Geneva on Thursday that the flight clearance had been given three days ago. The government delegation would announce its decision on whether to stay in the next 24 hours, he said: ""Tomorrow at noon you will hear something from us officially."" 
The government supported efforts to achieve peace through implementing U.N. Security Council resolution 2216, he said, referring to the 2015 call by world powers for a ceasefire and withdrawal of forces.
""But Houthis prove that they don’t want peace, they don’t believe in peace. We have this scheduled meeting since two months ago, we scheduled to make it on 6th of September, today we are alone here.”

Saudi Arabia's air defense forces intercepted and destroyed a ballistic missile fired by Yemen's Houthis in the southern city of Najran, wounding 26 people with shrapnel, Saudi civil defense said on Wednesday.

Reza Khandan is married to Nasrin Sotoudeh, an activist lawyer who served about half of a six-year jail sentence imposed in 2010 for spreading propaganda, then was arrested again in June.
Khandan, who had campaigned for his wife's release, told Iranian media then she was facing security charges. He said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Monday he had been called in for questioning by Iran's Ministry of Intelligence, and when he objected he was told, ""Then you'll be arrested"".
""France regrets the arrest in Tehran of Reza Khandan, husband of Nasrin Sotoudeh,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Agnes von der Muhll said in a statement. ""We remain very concerned about Mrs Sotoudeh, who started a hunger strike on Aug. 25, and we hope she and Mr. Khandan are released quickly.""
France rarely comments publicly on human rights issues in Iran. It is now working with Britain and Germany to save a 2015 agreement on Iran's nuclear program, which was thrown into disarray when U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of the accord in May and re-imposed economic sanctions on Iran. 
Even so, tensions between Paris and Tehran have grown in recent months ass President Emmanuel Macron and his government have become increasingly frustrated with Iran's regional activities, in particular its ballistic missile program.
Both countries have yet to appoint new ambassadors to each other's capitals.
Paris also told its diplomats and foreign ministry officials to postpone indefinitely all non-essential travel to Iran, citing a foiled bomb plot and a hardening of Tehran's attitude toward France.

12,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>",Indian opposition calls nationwide protests to take on Modi over fuel prices,"By Nidhi Verma
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's opposition will launch nationwide strikes and protests next week over record-high fuel prices, looking to tap rising public anger to hit back at Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of a series of elections.
Since Modi came to power in the world's third biggest oil consumer in May 2014, he has used tax hikes on petrol and diesel to raise funds for welfare programs. Taxes account for more than a third of retail fuel prices and past governments lowered them whenever international oil prices shot up.
The government has largely refused to cut taxes, drawing criticism from the main opposition Congress party for the ""fuel loot"" that it said had raised 11 trillion rupees ($152 billion) for the exchequer since Modi came to power in 2014.
""The mismanagement of the economy has led to high fuel prices,"" senior Congress leader Ashok Gehlot said. ""When fuel prices were rising during (the previous government), taxes were reduced to take the burden off people.""
Congress said all ""like-minded opposition parties"" had agreed to join the protest to demand fuel price cuts. The parties called for a general strike and demonstrations across the country.
A plunge in the rupee, which touched a fresh low of 72.095 on Thursday, has also helped lift local fuel prices. Asia's worst performing currency is down nearly 12 percent this year, which the government has blamed on economic woes of countries such as Turkey.
Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said its opponents were ""unnecessarily politicizing"" the issues when the economy was doing well under the current government.
""Overall inflation is under control, which suggests that the focus of the government is that common man should not suffer even if the prices of one component of the basket go up,"" BJP spokesman Syed Zafar Islam said.
Modi will fight a series of state elections in 2018 before a general election expected in early 2019.
DEMAND INTACT, FOR NOW
Fuel prices vary from state to state because of local taxes, but they have risen across the country. In Delhi, petrol prices are up about 14 percent this year while diesel is up a fifth.
But oil company officials and analysts do not yet expect a big impact on demand, which would be good news for suppliers stretching from the Middle East to United States.
India's fuel demand typically rises in the quarter to December due to festivals and a pick-up in construction activity after the monsoon season, M.K. Surana, chairman of state-run Hindustan Petroleum Corp told Reuters.
He said demand could be affected if international crude oil prices jumped sharply from the current level of $78 per barrel.
Sri Paravaikkarasu, head of East of Suez Oil for consultants FGE in Singapore, says oil prices above $80 a barrel will impact India's gasoline and gasoil demand, which are expected to rise by 10 percent and 5.7 percent, respectively this year as the nation's transport sector continues to boom.

GENOA, Italy (Reuters) - Italian magistrates are investigating 20 people for alleged manslaughter after 43 people died when a motorway bridge collapsed in the port city of Genoa last month, the chief prosecutor said.
A judicial source said separately that they included top executives of Autostrade, the company that runs the motorway, and its sister engineering company Spea.
The two companies - both units of Atlantia, the infrastructure group controlled by Italy's Benetton family - are under investigation as under Italian law firms are also held responsible for their employees' actions.
Genoa Chief Prosecutor Francesco Cozzi told reporters all the suspects had to be notified that they were under investigation before their names could be made public.
A 200-metre section of the Morandi bridge gave way on Aug. 14, plunging dozens of vehicles into the valley below.
The disaster provoked public outrage, and Rome's anti-establishment government piled blame on Autostrade, which operates the A10 motorway linking Genoa to the French border where the bridge was located.
Senior officials at Italy's infrastructure ministry are also being investigated, the source said. 
Under Italian rules, the motorway operator is responsible for maintenance, while the ministry has a supervisory role. 
Autostrade had no immediate comment. The ministry was not immediately available for comment. Autostrade has said in the past it carried regular checks on the bridge as required by the law.
Built during the post-war boom like much of Italy's infrastructure, the Morandi bridge had been shown to be defective soon after its completion in 1967.

Autostrade had been planning to strengthen the stays of the bridge and had launched a tender in April for the contract after obtaining the necessary approval from the ministry.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union will announce plans next week to strengthen its external borders and push foreign states to do more to deter migrants. 
The plans are a last effort by the European Commission led by Jean-Claude Juncker to toughen policy on an issue that has divided Europe since 2015 when more than a million refugees and migrants arrived across the Mediterranean.
But disagreements between EU states make a comprehensive deal on migration unlikely before the new Commission and parliament arrive next year.
Juncker will also propose more pathways for migrants to get to the EU legally including on study or work visas as he makes his last State of the Union speech in the European Parliament next Wednesday before stepping down.
The Commission will release proposals including to enhance the mandate of the bloc's Frontex agency for external borders, diplomats and officials said.
At the same time Austria, which currently holds the bloc's presidency, is trying to break a deadlock between member states over how to handle refugees and migrants who arrive by sea.
Under Vienna's proposal of ""mandatory solidarity"", EU states could accept refugees and migrants, provide experts or equipment for the bloc's external borders or make other contributions.
The plan does not require all member states to host new arrivals. The EU's ex-communist eastern members oppose hosting these people - just one issue that has damaged the bloc's unity.
This year, sea arrivals stand at some 70,000 people, a fraction of the mass influx in 2015 that overwhelmed EU states and stretched services, precipitating a rise in the bloc's populist, nationalist and anti-immigration parties. 
""We are still handling an acute political crisis in the EU, even though the arrivals are next to none,"" a senior diplomat in Brussels said. 
Italy remains opposed to Austria's plan. Rome has pushed more rigid anti-immigration policies and denied several rescue ships access to its ports. It says other EU states should take in the migrants. 
EU leaders will discuss migration again at a summit in Salzburg on Sept. 19-20. 
ENTRENCHED 
They will also discuss stepping up returns and deportations of people who make it to the EU but fail to win asylum. 
The EU is entering a campaign season with European Parliament elections due next May and a new Commission to be installed in late 2019. 
As a result, member states would have to agree a new migration package this year to give the Parliament a chance to approve it before its final session in mid-April, diplomats say.
The Commission's new measures further develop policies implemented since 2015 that have contributed to a sharp decrease in migration by sea. Rights groups say the policies leave migrants vulnerable to abuses and death on land and at sea.
The bloc's idea for ""regional disembarkation platforms"" around the Mediterranean aimed to open EU ports for rescue ships and then spread the migrants on board across the bloc. 
The plan was honed after an EU summit last June that saw Italy and Germany face off through the night. But it appears stillborn as member states remain reluctant to take immigrants in, let alone through an obligatory scheme.

15,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2018 11:03AM ET</span>",Kurdish-led council deepens authority across Syrian north and east,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - The political wing of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces has started forming a unified administration for its territory, a move that would consolidate its authority in northern and eastern Syria.
The SDF controls around a quarter of the country, much of it captured from Islamic State with U.S. military help. It is the largest chunk of Syria outside the hands of President Bashar al-Assad's state.
The SDF wants the seven-year war to end with a federal system that secures minority rights, including for Kurds.
Kurdish leaders say they do not seek an independent state. They have mostly avoided conflict with Assad, as his army defeated rebel factions in western Syria fighting to topple him.
Bringing together SDF territory under a single administration signals they are looking at their potential future role, and comes as they seek to open new channels to Assad's government. 
The steps announced on Thursday, at a meeting which the Syrian Democratic Council convened, will combine civil councils that govern various swathes of the north and east.
The meeting included officials from the SDF, Manbij town, Raqqa city, Deir al-Zor province and Kurdish parts of the north, the SDC said in a statement. 
The SDF alliance, which the Kurdish YPG militia spearheads, has expanded beyond mainly Kurdish parts of the north, where the forces have carved out autonomous cantons since the onset of Syria's conflict. Its region now includes the majority Arab Raqqa, Islamic State's former headquarters in Syria, and eastern Deir al-Zor at the Iraqi border.
The meeting agreed a mechanism to build the new administration and elected a board in charge of it, the SDC said. 
Siham Karyo, co-president of the board, said the change would help ""the people overcome difficulties and provide services until we reach a democratic, decentralized Syria"", according to local Kurdish news agency ANHA. 
SDC co-chair Riad Darar has said the new administration will ""practice a form of governance"".
It appears to be another step aiming to cement authority across the north and east, as well as overhaul the region's image with an eye to its future.
Throughout the war, Damascus has opposed Kurdish autonomy plans, as does Washington. 
Last month, SDF officials held talks with Assad's government in their first declared visit to the capital. 
Kurdish leaders hope for a political deal, but have grown wary of an unpredictable U.S. ally which they fear could put its ties with NATO member Turkey first.

U.S support for Syrian Kurdish forces has infuriated Ankara, which sees the YPG as an extension of the outlawed Kurdish PKK movement that has fought a decades-long insurgency in Turkey.

A spokesman for the state interior ministry of Thuringia said on Thursday the move followed comments by Bjoern Hoecke, a state AfD leader who has decried Germany's main memorial to Holocaust victims as a ""monument of shame"".
Sixty-five percent of Germans considered it appropriate to put the entire AfD under surveillance, a poll conducted for broadcaster ARD showed on Thursday.
On Monday, the states of Lower Saxony and Bremen said their regional security services, tasked with policing unconstitutional activity, had placed their regional chapters of Young Alternative, the AfD's youth wing, under surveillance because of suspected ties to extremists.
Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday accused the AfD of stirring up ethnic tension in Germany after a fatal stabbing in the eastern city of Chemnitz that has been blamed on migrants.
The AfD won 12.6 percent of the vote in the September 2017 election, parlaying concerns about Merkel's liberal immigration policies to become the first far-right party to enter the German parliament in five decades.
It is expected to make further gains in a regional poll in the southern state of Bavaria in October.
In June, the German government condemned an apparent attempt by Alexander Gauland, co-leader of the AfD, to play down the significance of the Nazis in Germany's history.
Gauland later said he had not intended to trivialize the Nazis and their crimes.

Members of the Social Democrats, junior partners in Merkel's ruling coalition, and some conservatives back surveillance of the AfD, citing the participation of Hoecke and other AfD leaders in a march with the anti-Islam PEGIDA group in Chemnitz at the weekend.

BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romania's justice minister nominated a little-known regional official, Adina Florea, for the post of national anti-corruption prosecutor on Thursday, following the controversial removal of Laura Codruta Kovesi from the post in July. 
Critics say the removal of Kovesi, praised by the European Union for her efforts to convict high-level politicians, is part of efforts by ruling leftists to undermine anti-graft policies and could leave prosecutors exposed to political interference.
She was sacked by President Klaus Iohannis following a Constitutional Court ruling validating a request by the government.
""I don't know of any big corruption-related cases solved by (Florea),"" said independent political commentator Mircea Marian. ""There is no link between proposing her and the fight against high-level corruption.""
In a document outlining her views on the anti-corruption office (DNA), Florea, a prosecutor in the port town of Constanta, wrote the institution has operated at times in a ""dysfunctional"" way. She accused some prosecutors of illegal activities in pursuing cases.
In comments that sparked widespread protests in Romania earlier this year, justice minister Tudorel Toader had accused Kovesi of exceeding her authority and damaging the country's image abroad.
Considered by government critics as a symbol of the fight against corruption, Kovesi has blamed politicians for attempting to block the functioning of justice by softening legislation to seek protection against prosecution for ""past, present and future"" deeds.
Under Kovesi, the DNA had investigated lawmakers, ministers and mayors, exposing conflicts of interest, abuse of power, fraud and awarding of state contracts in exchange for bribes.
Concerns over the rule of law in Romania follow similar issues in Poland and Hungary, where governments are under pressure for the EU over democratic standards. 
To become official, Florea's appointment will have to be approved by Iohannis, a centrist politician often at odds with the ruling leftists over corruption policy.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's top court scrapped a colonial-era ban on gay sex on Thursday, in a landmark judgment that sparked celebrations across India and elsewhere in South Asia, where activists hope to push for similar reform.
Gay sex is considered taboo by many in socially conservative India, as well as in neighboring Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. It was reinstated as a criminal offense in India in 2013, punishable up to 10 years in prison, after four years of decriminalization.
A five-judge bench in India's Supreme Court was unanimous in overturning the ban. But the ruling could face a legal challenge from groups that say gay sex erodes traditional values.
""Any consensual sexual relationship between two consenting adults - homosexuals, heterosexuals or lesbians - cannot be said to be unconstitutional,"" said the Chief Justice of India, Dipak Misra, as he read out the judgment.
Supporters of the campaign to scrap the ban milled around the court before the verdict and cheered the decision, hugging one another and waving rainbow flags.
Some were overcome with emotion, while others waved banners with slogans such as ""Gay and Proud"" and ""I am who I am"". A few distributed sweets in celebration.
""I'm so excited, I have no words,"" said Debottam Saha, one of the petitioners in the case.
Activists hope the scrapping of the ban will uphold the right to equality but many acknowledged that discrimination would persist.
""We are no longer criminals, (but) it will take time to change things on the ground - 20 to 30 years, maybe,"" said Saha.
Balachandran Ramiah, a second petitioner, also said there was ""a long road ahead when it comes to changing societal mindsets"", and stressed the importance of employers ending discrimination in workplaces.
""A number of companies up until now were unable to put these down on paper,"" he said, referring to steps to end discrimination.
""Now they can.""
LONG ROAD
The law against gay sex, known as ""Section 377"", was introduced during British rule of South Asia more than a century-and-a-half ago. 
The law banned ""carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal"" - which was widely interpreted to refer to homosexual sex.
The battle to repeal Section 377 began in 2001, when a group called the Naz Foundation challenged it in court. That eventually led to its repeal in 2009.
It was reinstated in 2013 after a legal challenge from an astrologer, Suresh Kumar Kaushal, who told Reuters on Thursday the latest verdict would erode traditional society.
""Marriage is the most sacred part of our culture, many cultures actually,"" he said. ""Sexual relations are a sacred part of this bond."" 
The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party had said it would support any decision by the Supreme Court but one prominent member of the party criticized the court ruling.
""This verdict could give rise to other issues such as an increase in the number of HIV cases,"" member of parliament Subramanian Swamy told CNN-News18.
Shashi Tharoor, a senior member of the opposition Congress party, said ""the government has no place in the bedroom"".
""Private acts between consenting adults is something which no government should have criminalized as unfortunately we have done,"" he said.
Activists in Muslim-majority Bangladesh and Pakistan said they planned to push for reform of the laws that their countries also inherited from colonial Britain.
""The Bangladeshi LGBT community has gained moral support,"" said Shahanur Islam, executive director of the Bangladesh Institute for Human Rights.

""We hope and will make sure that other countries will follow suit in overturning this remnant from colonial law,” said Mani Aq of the Pakistani branch of the Naz Foundation.

20,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2018 09:10AM ET</span>",Merkel accuses far-right party of stoking ethnic tension,"By Joseph Nasr
BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday accused the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) of using violent protests over a fatal stabbing blamed on migrants to stir up ethnic tension.
Far-right groups clashed with police and chased people they deemed to be migrants in the eastern city of Chemnitz on Aug. 26 after police said a Syrian and an Iraqi had been detained as suspects in the killing of a 35-year-old German man.
AfD leader Alexander Gauland had earlier this week urged a ""peaceful revolution"" against Merkel's liberal immigration policy and said this required banishing politicians and members of the media who support the ""Merkel system"".
Asked about the role of the AfD in the events in Chemnitz, Merkel told the RTL broadcaster: ""The AfD is stirring up the mood and this has to be said clearly. I view some of their remarks very critically.""
The protests in Chemnitz have set off a debate about whether politicians are being too complacent in the face of rising xenophobia in a country where many had thought the lessons of Germany's Nazi history had been learned.
The protests, during which some members of an 800-strong crowd performed the illegal Hitler salute, laid bare the divisions in Germany over Merkel's decision in 2015 to take in around one million, mostly Muslim asylum seekers.
Some in Germany blame Merkel's liberal immigration policy for the rise of the AfD, which entered parliament for the first time in an election last year as the third-largest party.
After the violence in Chemnitz, German politicians urged intelligence agencies to start monitoring the far-right party, some of whose members marched with supporters of the anti-Islam PEGIDA group in the city last weekend to protest the stabbing.
'NOT NAZIS'
Merkel repeated her position in the RTL interview that only intelligence chiefs can decide whether to monitor the party.
""We first want to deal with the AfD politically,"" Merkel said.
The state intelligence agency in Thuringia on Thursday said it would examine whether the AfD's state chapter was pursuing anti-constitutional goals, a possible step toward putting the group under official surveillance.
Merkel's immigration policy has also caused a rift within her conservative bloc, which includes her Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Christian Social Union (CSU) Bavarian allies, that almost toppled her coalition government in June.
Interior Minister and CSU leader Horst Seehofer had threatened to pull out of the coalition government over immigration.
In an interview with the Rheinische Post published on Thursday, Seehofer said: ""People are annoyed and outraged because of such homicides and I understand that.
""If I had not been a minister, I would have taken to the streets as a citizen, but of course not with the radicals.""
He added: ""I understand it when people protest, but this doesn't make them Nazis.""
Seehofer has taken an increasingly hardline stance on immigration as his party tries to fight off a strong challenge from the AfD in October's regional election in Bavaria.
Seehofer was rebuked by politicians and Germans on social media for telling CSU members in the eastern state of Brandenburg on Wednesday: ""Migration is the mother of all problems.""

Asked what she thought about Seehofer's remark, Merkel said: ""I say it differently. Migration presents us with challenges and here we have problems but also successes.""

Spain has become the main entry point for migrants fleeing Africa to seek a better life in Europe, overtaking Italy and Greece, as Italy's new populist government refuses to admit rescue boats.
Dozens of migrants dressed in hooded white forensic suits disembarked from a rescue vessel on Thursday in the port of Motril in the southern region of Andalusia, video footage showed. 
Survivors from one of the rafts rescued said four other people had been lost at sea earlier in the journey, a spokeswoman for the coastguard said but could not confirm the higher death toll. 
Migrants found dead or missing in Spanish waters have already surpassed the 153 reported for last year, Spanish coastguard figures show. By the end of August this year, 155 migrants had been reported dead or missing without counting the latest fatalities.
A total of 33,195 illegal migrants had entered Spain as at the end of August, Interior Ministry data shows. This is more than double the number for the same period last year.

Volunteers from the national Red Cross are conducting search and rescue operations in North and South Hwanghae provinces, where heavy rains began on August 28, it said, adding that many children were among the 75 missing.
""Heavy rains in recent days triggered large-scale flooding and landslides in low-lying areas, destroying more than 800 buildings including homes, clinics and schools,"" the Geneva-based Federation said in a statement.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China will train Afghan troops on Chinese soil, Afghanistan's ambassador to Beijing said, describing the military cooperation as an effort to fight al Qaeda and Islamic State militants bent on attacking China from its western neighbor.
Afghanistan has also requested that China provide Afghan security forces with combat helicopters, Ambassador Janan Mosazai told Reuters in an interview.
Beijing last month dismissed reports that Chinese troops would be stationed in its war-torn neighbor, after it agreed to help Afghanistan set up a ""mountain brigade"" in the rugged Wakhan Corridor linking the two countries.
""But yes, there will be some training required, obviously, and that will take place in China,"" Mosazai said in the interview on Tuesday.
The Chinese military had promised to supply two fixed-wing transport aircraft for medical evacuation purposes, he added, and crews for the planes were already training in China.
""Those are in the pipeline, and we hope they will be delivered to Afghanistan, to our national security and defense forces, soon,"" Mosazai said. ""We have requested that they provide combat vehicles, combat helicopters, also air capabilities and reconnaissance.""
Mosazai said China's response towards the request for the helicopters had been ""positive"", and that Kabul wanted Beijing to provide the capabilities or the ""grant assistance"" so Afghanistan could purchase them.
China's Defence Ministry did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
The provision of arms to Afghanistan marks a gradual evolution for Beijing, which had previously offered non-lethal assistance while promising to play a ""huge"" commercial role in the country's economic development, a pledge complicated by the security situation there.
Mosazai did not elaborate on financial details or types of vehicles under consideration, but said the helicopters being sought were most likely to be older Russian or Soviet-made equipment, such as the MI-35.
China has stepped up ""direct military assistance to Afghanistan"", including providing small arms and logistics and equipment support, since the two countries established a military dialogue in 2016, the ambassador said. 
Beijing has confirmed its backing for the Afghan defense forces struggling against a Taliban insurgency that has taken swathes of territory in recent years, but it has offered few details.
The Afghan air force, trained and assisted by NATO advisers, has slowly gained strength, but remains too small to meet the needs of its security forces. The United States has planned to help replace Afghanistan's aging fleet of Russian Mi-17 helicopters with U.S.-made UH-60 Black Hawks.
RETURNING MILITANTS
Last year, China opened its first overseas military base, in the Horn of Africa country of Djibouti. It has previously denied having plans for other overseas bases, but the United States expects it to build more, with Pakistan a possible location.
Mosazai reiterated that ""there will not be any Chinese military personnel in Afghanistan, related to the mountain brigade or otherwise"". 
The ""context"" for setting up the brigade - likely to be based in Afghanistan's northeastern Badakhshan province - was to combat the return of al Qaeda and Islamic State fighters from the Middle East who aim to launch attacks in Central Asia and China, the ambassador said.
Among those militants are members of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, he said, which Beijing blames for violence in its Xinjiang region bordering Afghanistan. 
China worries that militancy in Afghanistan could spill over into Xinjiang, home to the Muslim Uighur people, where human rights advocates say Beijing is implementing near martial law restrictions, including political re-education camps for potentially millions of Uighurs. 
U.S. forces in Afghanistan in February said they had attacked networks of anti-China militants.
""Their primary targets are their countries of origin,"" Mosazai said of militants presumed to be returning from fighting in Syria and Iraq, adding that Afghanistan had been clear with countries in the region, including China, about the ""need to step up"" support.

Russian citizens identified as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov were charged in absentia by Britain on Wednesday with trying to murder Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia with a military-grade nerve agent in England.
British authorities have said the men were Russian military intelligence agents traveling with genuine Russian passports, but under aliases.
The Kremlin denied that Russia had been in any way involved in the poisoning, describing British accusations that an attack had been approved by senior Russian officials as ""unacceptable"".
Fontanka said people using the passports in the names of Petrov and Boshirov traveled to Amsterdam, Geneva, Milan and Paris on multiple occasions between September 2016 and March 2018. A person using Petrov's passport traveled to London at least once before the Skripals were poisoned, for a visit from Feb. 28. 
Fontanka, an independent Russian media outlet with a strong track record of investigative reporting, did not disclose the source of its information.
Yulia Skripal and her father Sergei, a former colonel in Russian military intelligence who betrayed dozens of agents to Britain’s MI6 foreign spy service, were found unconscious on a public bench in the British city of Salisbury on March 4.
They were in hospital for weeks and have both now been discharged.
Britain said they were poisoned with the Novichok nerve agent developed in Russia, and that it was highly likely the Russian state had tried to murder them. The case brought the biggest round of East-West diplomatic expulsions since the Cold War. 
Russia said British authorities had failed to produce any evidence of Russian involvement in the poisoning and showed no interest in conducting a thorough investigation.
A woman later died from Novichok poisoning after her partner found a counterfeit perfume bottle which police believe had been used to smuggle the nerve agent into Britain.
The Russian foreign ministry said in a statement released late on Wednesday that a speech by British Prime Minister Theresa May threatening Russia with retaliation over the poisoning was delivered in an ""unacceptable tone.""
Referring to May's accusations of Russia's involvement in the poisoning, the statement said: ""We decisively reject these insinuations.""

The incident happened just days after Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta attended a summit in China, which is a crucial partner for the East African nation. President Xi Jinping offered another $60 billion in financing for Africa.
Officers on Wednesday raided the CGTN's offices in Nairobi and detained some staff for what they alleged were immigration offences. 
""The raid on the Chinese state-owned broadcaster was based on false information,"" Charles Owino, Kenya's national police spokesman told Reuters. ""We sincerely apologize for the mishap... Those detained were released later.""
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying confirmed the raid, telling a daily news briefing in Beijing that Kenyan police, during a sweep of illegal workers, had taken away several Chinese reporters and other staff members.
The Chinese embassy immediately complained to the Kenyan government and all the personnel were released on the same day, Hua added.
""The Kenyan side has already apologized to the Chinese side about the improper law enforcement, and promised they will constrain the actions of police at the grassroots … and prevent such incidents from happening again,"" Hua said. 
""According to what we understand, this action by the Kenyan policy is part of a move to crack down on illegal immigration, and is neither aimed at nor limited to Chinese citizens."" 
The propaganda department at China's main state television station CCTV, which is the parent of CGTN, declined to comment on the incident.
China has helped to finance key infrastructure projects in Kenya, including a $3-billion railway that links the capital Nairobi to the port of Mombasa. 
A growing number of Chinese citizens have moved to Kenya as economic links have expanded and some local media have reported occasional incidents between Kenyans and the newcomers.
In an unusual move, Kenya's Immigration Department on Wednesday posted a picture of a Chinese national who was captured in a video that circulated widely on social media uttering racist slurs against Kenyans, including against President Kenyatta. It said he had been arrested.
""His work permit has been canceled and he will be deported on racism grounds,"" the department said in a tweet.

The rial currency has lost about two-thirds of its value this year under the threat of the sanctions, reimposed by President Donald Trump after he withdrew Washington from a 2015 nuclear agreement between Tehran and world powers.
The cost of living has also soared, sparking sporadic demonstrations against profiteering and corruption, with many protestors chanting anti-government slogans.

""Based on our intelligence, the U.S. and Zionist (Israeli) spy agencies, financed by the super-rich of our region, have set up an organization for this media war and are seriously planning and trying to infect the advertising space and the minds in our community,"" Khamenei said.
Saudi Arabia, Iran's main regional rival, and the United Arab Emirates have backed Trump’s decision to reimpose sanctions on Tehran, reflecting the wealthy oil exporters' concern about Iran’s ballistic missile program and support for militant groups.
Trump said on Wednesday he remained open to the possibility of talks between Washington and Tehran. However, he added: ""Iran is in turmoil right now. They're in total turmoil.""

""Now they are just worrying about their own survival as a country,"" he told reporters, without offering any evidence.

Prosecutors in Genoa can begin immediately to sequester up to 48.9 million euros ($56.8 million) in funds from accounts and businesses belonging to the party, one source said. The party can appeal against each single asset seizure.
The prosecution began looking for the money last year after the League's founder and former leader, Umberto Bossi, was convicted for illegally using party funds to pay for family expenses from 2008 to 2010.
After that ruling, which is now under appeal, magistrates tracked down only about 3 million euros in the party's accounts and judicial sources have said the other funds may have been shifted abroad to avoid seizure.
Giancarlo Giorgetti, a high-ranking member of the League, last week said the possible sequester of party funds in the future was a threat to the party's existence.
But League leader Matteo Salvini, who is also deputy prime minister, played down the ruling on Thursday.
""I'm not the least bit upset because the trial regards things that happened eight, nine years ago,"" Salvini told reporters. 
""If they want to take everything away from us, we'll still calmly remain in politics because Italians are with us,"" he added.

30,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2018 07:49AM ET</span>","North Korea's Kim sets denuclearization time line, prompting thanks from Trump","By Hyonhee Shin and Susan Heavey
SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea's Kim Jong Un has given his first time line for denuclearization, aiming for the end of U.S. President Donald Trump's first term, Seoul officials said on Thursday, prompting thanks from Trump who said they would ""get it done together"".
Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in will also meet in Pyongyang on Sept. 18-20 for a third summit and discuss ""practical measures"" toward denuclearization, Moon's national security adviser, Chung Eui-yong, said a day after meeting Kim.
The summit could provide renewed momentum to talks over denuclearization between North Korea and the United States, after Trump canceled a visit to Pyongyang by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last month citing lack of progress.
Kim told South Korean officials his faith in Trump was ""unchanged"" and that he wanted denuclearization and an end to hostile relations with the United States before Trump's first term in office ends in early 2021, Chung said.
""He particularly emphasized that he has never said anything negative about President Trump,"" Chung said.
Trump welcomed Kim's remarks in a trademark Tweet.
""Kim Jong Un of North Korea proclaims 'unwavering faith in President Trump.' Thank you to Chairman Kim. We will get it done together!"" Trump wrote.
In previous, failed talks, North Korea has said it could consider giving up its nuclear program if the United States provided security guarantees by removing troops from South Korea and withdrawing its so-called nuclear umbrella of deterrence from the South and Japan.
U.S. officials involved in the latest negotiations have said North Korea has refused to even start discussions about defining denuclearization or other key terms such as ""verifiable"" and ""irreversible"", and has insisted the United States must first agree to simultaneous steps to reduce economic pressure.
Pompeo, visiting New Delhi, declined to discuss the next steps but said there was a long road ahead in the denuclearization process.
Pompeo visited Pyongyang in July, after which North Korea accused him of making ""unilateral and gangster-like demands for denuclearization"" while showing little interest in ending the war.
""It is the case that there is still an enormous amount of work to do,"" Pompeo told a news conference on Thursday.
Asked about U.S. intelligence that North Korea was still advancing its weapons programs, Pompeo noted that Pyongyang had ceased its nuclear tests and test-firing missiles, ""which we consider a good thing.
""But the work of convincing Chairman Kim to make this strategic shift that we've talked about for a brighter future for the people of North Korea continues,"" Pompeo said.
Moon's national security adviser Chung said Kim had stressed the need for the United States to reciprocate North Korea's initial moves, which have included dismantling a nuclear test site and a missile engine facility.
The U.S. embassy in Seoul said it had no information to share on the matter.
FRUSTRATION
North Korea's official KCNA news agency said Kim told the South's envoys that his ""fixed stand"" was to turn the Korean peninsula into ""a cradle of peace without nuclear weapons, free from nuclear threat"".
Chung said Kim showed ""frustration over the doubt raised by some parts of the international community about his willingness to denuclearize, and asked us to convey his message to the United States"".
""He said he would appreciate that such good faith is accepted with good faith,"" Chung said. ""He expressed his strong will to carry out more proactive measures toward denuclearization if action is taken in response to the North's preemptive steps.""
U.S. officials have previously said they have already made concessions, such as halting joint military exercises with South Korea.
During his meeting with Kim, Chung delivered a message from Trump and will relay comments from Kim to U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton, Moon's spokesman, Kim Eui-kyeom, told reporters.
Trump spoke to Moon on the evening before Chung's trip and asked Moon to act as ""chief negotiator"" between Washington and Pyongyang, the spokesman said.
WHAT HAPPENS FIRST?
Kim and Trump held a landmark summit in Singapore in June, in which they agreed to work toward complete denuclearization. But negotiations have made little progress, while signs North Korea has maintained work on its weapons have emerged.
Under discussion is whether denuclearization or declaring an end to the 1950-53 Korean War should come first.
The war ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty, meaning U.S.-led U.N. forces, including South Korea, are technically still at war with the North.
""The United States shouldn't delay any further an end-of-war declaration, which the U.S. president promised at the Singapore summit,"" the North's official Rodong Sinmun newspaper said in an editorial.
U.S. officials have said such a declaration could weaken North Korea's incentive for denuclearization, and create uncertainty about the purpose of 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea, a legacy of the three-year war.
""Looks like Kim is trying to wash away worries that talks could stall or fail, knowing well that Washington is losing patience,"" said Koh Yu-hwan, a professor of North Korean Studies at Dongguk University in Seoul.

""Kim also made it clear that he needs some kind of proof Trump has abandoned the U.S.'s hostile policy before moving toward denuclearization. Kim is trying to prove his sincerity.""

BELFAST/LONDON (Reuters) - The British government is to cut the pay of members of Northern Ireland's parliament in its latest attempt to break a political deadlock that has left the region with no government for almost 20 months, the minister for Northern Ireland said on Thursday. 
The executive - a central plank of a 1998 peace deal that ended three decades of sectarian violence - has been frozen since Irish nationalists Sinn Fein pulled out in January 2017, saying they were not being treated as equal partners by the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). 
Repeated attempts to break the deadlock have failed, but Northern Ireland minister Karen Bradley on Thursday told the British parliament that she would make a fresh push to restart talks in the coming weeks. 
""As this impasse continues, public services are suffering. Businesses are suffering. The people of Northern Ireland are suffering,"" Bradley told parliament. ""Local decision-making is urgently needed to address this.""
Bradley said Britain would cut the pay of Northern Ireland deputies by 7,000 pounds ($9,050) from November and by a further 6,000 pounds from February if no agreement is reached. 
At the same time legislation will be introduced to provisions to give ""greater clarity and certainty"" to the civil service to take decisions in Northern Ireland to ensure the delivery of public services, she said. 
The move is the latest step toward re-imposing direct rule of the region, including imposing a budget directly from London. The British government has been reluctant to take direct control for fear of angering Irish nationalists and the Irish government.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar in July said he planned to try to get the parties together for talks in the autumn.

The ""Fears of the Germans"" survey from R+V Versicherung showed that 69 percent are worried that Trump is making the world a more dangerous place with his policies, which have included withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal and Paris climate accord.
That compared to 63 percent who expressed fear that Germany risked being overwhelmed by refugees and 59 percent who listed terrorism as a top concern, down sharply from 71 percent last year.
""Trump's brutal 'America First' stance, his hostility to international agreements and his aggressive trade and security policies, including toward allies, are frightening a majority of the population,"" said Manfred Schmidt, a political scientist in Heidelberg who advises R+V on the survey.
""Trump's attacks on Germany are having a growing impact on sentiment,"" he added, referring to the president's frequent verbal assaults on Germany's trade surplus and relatively low levels of defense spending.
Among other concerns in the survey, 57 percent of Germans expressed fear about political extremism and 56 percent said they were worried about natural catastrophes.
The survey of roughly 2,400 Germans was conducted in June and July, before far-right protests in the eastern city of Chemnitz following the fatal stabbing of a German man, allegedly by two migrants, drew worldwide attention.
Terrorism had topped the fears ranking in the previous two years. In the five years prior to that, the top concern had been the cost of the euro crisis for German taxpayers.
The 2018 survey was released a day after an anonymous senior official in the Trump administration penned a column in the New York Times describing the president as amoral and unmoored, and detailing how members of his team are thwarting parts of his agenda in order to protect the United States.
Earlier this week, excerpts of a new book by veteran Watergate reporter Bob Woodward painted a picture of chaos in the White House and disdain among top aides over how the president is doing his job.

ABENSBERG, Germany (Reuters) - For decades the conservative Christian Social Union has run the state of Bavaria - famous for BMWs, beer festivals and the Bayern Munich soccer club - as it sees fit, ignoring the vagaries of German national politics.
That may change next month, when an election risks upsetting the party in a development that would also have grave implications for Chancellor Angela Merkel's government in Berlin, where the CSU is an important ally.
Once poor, Bavaria enjoyed remarkable post-war economic modernization under the CSU while retaining its regional identity - a 'Laptops and Lederhosen' formula that has earned the state-based party a unique role as a powerful conservative force in national politics.
Now that exceptionalism is under threat.
At the Oct. 14 state election, the CSU is likely to lose its absolute majority - with which it has ruled Bavaria for most of the post-war period, and which has allowed the party to punch above its weight as a partner in successive German governments.
The main reason for the slide: the rise of the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD), which has divided the electorate and is threatening the Bavarian exceptionalism with which the CSU has for decades been synonymous.
In response, CSU leaders are trying to revive the feeling that their party represents the essence of Bavaria: a distinct identity backed by economic success that has produced the lowest jobless rate - 2.9 percent - of any German state.
""Germany is so successful because of us Bavarians!"" state premier Markus Soeder, 51, roared on Monday to a packed beer tent in Abensberg, a sleepy town north of Munich, which comes alive once a year for the Gillamoos fair - a traditional festival claiming roots dating to 1313.
Pushing all the regional identity buttons he could, Soeder arrived wearing a traditional Bavarian jacket to the sound of a brass band belting out the Bayerischer Defiliermarsch, a 19th century march that is Bavaria's unofficial anthem.
""We need a political anchor, a political compass,"" he told 4,000 revelers in the tent. ""In Bavaria, that is the CSU - who else?""
""The world is changing but Bavaria remains Bavaria thanks to the CSU,"" he bellowed to rapturous applause.
Beyond the beer tent, the message isn't resonating so well.
Support for the CSU has slumped to 36 percent from the 47.7 percent it scored at the last Bavarian election in 2013.
Such a low score next month would mark a dramatic decline from the CSU's peak under Franz Josef Strauss, who led the party to victory in 1974 with 62.1 percent of the vote. As recently as 2003, it still enjoyed 60.7 percent support.
""Only because we are so strong in Bavaria, can we act with the associated confidence at the federal level,"" said CSU lawmaker Michael Frieser. ""The Bavarian is different, he defines himself through his independence.""
STUMBLING SWAGGER
That swagger saw Bavaria choose not to sign the founding treaty of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949, which it felt did not grant sufficient powers to the states, though it nevertheless decided to join the republic.
More recently, Bavaria's economic strength has allowed the CSU to exert influence disproportionate to its size in its alliance - 'the Union' - with Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which does not field candidates in Bavaria.
Even with the CSU's sinking ratings, a bid by the party's Manfred Weber to succeed Jean-Claude Juncker as EU chief executive has been backed by Merkel.
But CDU allies of the chancellor are frustrated by what they see as a hostile and divided CSU leadership, unnerved by its diminishing support in Bavaria. CDU figures fear a weak CSU election result could cause more friction with their south German ally.
This summer, CSU leaders pushed their alliance with the CDU close to breaking point by demanding a harder line on immigration - a lurch to the right in response to AfD's gains - before switching course and trying to reclaim the center ground.
Soeder rammed home the centrist message in Abensberg, accusing the AfD of marching ""side by side"" with far-right hooligans in Chemnitz, a city in eastern Germany where violent protests have followed the arrest of two migrants over the fatal stabbing of a German man.
The flip-flopping is dividing the CSU's traditional broad base of support. Some moderates, unhappy at the party's move to the right over immigration, are turning to the ecologist Greens, which enjoy 15 percent support. Hardliners are drawn to the AfD, currently polling 14 percent.
In Abensberg, AfD activist Michael Rutkowski, 61, said many voters are worried about their children's prospects even if Bavaria is doing well now. The state is home to multinationals Siemens, BMW, Audi, Adidas (DE:ADSGN), and Allianz (DE:ALVG) as well as a host of tech start-ups.
Merkel's 2015 decision to open Germany's borders to one million refugees was ""irresponsible"", Rutkowski said, adding: ""People don't feel safe anymore. They don't trust the old politicians anymore.""
COMEBACK RECORD
The CSU leaders' hard line on immigration is motivated by Strauss's mantra that there must never be a democratic, legitimate party to the CSU's right.
Under Strauss, who led the CSU from 1961 to 1988, the party nurtured strong support from a broad political spectrum, and developed the sense of regional independence that stems from Bavaria's history as a kingdom.
""What is happening now is the CSU is dividing Bavaria,"" said Manfred Guellner, chief of polling institute Forsa. The CSU's hard-nosed approach with Merkel on immigration had only boosted the AfD and driven away liberal CSU voters, he added.
An order from Soeder for all regional government buildings to display a cross hasn't won back conservatives either.
In a recent Forsa survey in Bavaria, one third of CSU voters said they would rather vote CDU than CSU if they could, Guellner said. Mass-selling daily Bild has pointed out that an ""anti-CSU alliance"" could become a danger for the party.
""The fact that possibility is even being thought about is a catastrophe for the CSU,"" said Guellner.
The CSU has been here before. In 1954, it lost to a coalition led by the left-leaning Social Democrats, but regained power in 1957. In 2008, the CSU lost its absolute majority but won it back in 2013. 
""Not everything is going to turn to ashes after the election in October,"" said Matthias Dilling at Oxford University, an expert on Christian democratic parties. ""The CSU has gone through very difficult times in its history.""
With each comeback, the party's on-the-ground network has been crucial.
In Abensberg, district CSU chief Martin Neumeyer, 63, is appealing to voters with the motto ""we are listening"".
""The CSU must fight,"" he said. ""We don't have a minute or a day to lose.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - For the first time in five years, North Korea is expected to put on a massive performance on Sunday known as the ""Mass Games"".
With thousands of twirling gymnasts and dancers backed by an ever-changing display of images and words glorifying the North Korean state and its people, past Mass Games have produced some of the most iconic images of the isolated country.
This year's performances come as leader Kim Jong Un seeks to rebrand North Korea as a responsible nuclear-armed state more focused on developing its economy than rattling proverbial sabres.
Sunday's Mass Games will be one of several high profile events, including a military parade, to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of North Korea. It will kick off a month of events designed to lure foreign investment, attract tourists, and showcase Kim's new focus on the economy.
Here is how analysts and observers who have attended past games and study North Korea describe the pageants.
WHAT ARE THE MASS GAMES?
Despite their name, North Korea's Mass Games are a huge art and dance performance, similar to opening and closing ceremonies for the Winter or Summer Olympics. 
The games have come in various versions over the years, with shows emphasizing different historic, economic, political, and cultural themes.
Up to 100,000 people are mobilized to perform during the show, an undertaking designed to demonstrate social unity, analysts say. 
But critics say the games white-wash North Korea's human rights record, and testimonies collected by the defector-run website Daily NK have described months of harsh training for school children involved in past events.
Ahn Chan-il, a former North Korean military official who defected to the South in 1979, said some past games were eventually phased out by North Korea's leaders in part because of complaints from parents.
Families of participants often received rare items such as color TVs, and some people compete for the chance to perform, which helps limit complaints, he said. 
The shows are usually performed in Pyongyang's cavernous 1st of May Stadium, said to be one of the largest stadiums in the world.
Gymnasts and dancers performed on the field, while thousands of school children sitting in the stadium's seats used colored flip books to create huge, shifting displays of images and words.
The main theme of the most famous of the Mass Games, Arirang, was the glory of the nation that North Koreans had built after the horrors of Japanese occupation and the 1950-1953 Korean War, said Simon Cockerell, general manager of the tour agency Koryo Tours, who attended multiple mass games between 2002 and 2013.
""For many North Koreans who went, it was quite touching,"" he said. 
This year's version of the games, Cockerell said, are rumored to be more high-tech.
""So maybe more of a laser show, or computer generated imagery.""
WHAT ARE THEY ABOUT?
North Korea researcher Andray Abrahamian has called the Mass Games ""quite literally the official national narrative bundled into a 90-minute spectacle"".
""Mainly they serve to reinforce the national story while simultaneously demonstrating very high levels of skill and coordination,"" he said, comparing the Mass Games to the United States' football Super Bowl, with its celebrations of ""heroism, the military and advertising and commerce.""
Observers expect this year's games will likely reflect Kim Jong Un's new focus on the economy and international engagement.
Although North Korea is scheduled to stage a large military parade in Pyongyang on the same day as the opening of the Mass Games, military messages may be less of a focus, they say.
After having declared his country's nuclear program ""complete"", Kim said this year he would stop testing weapons and make all-out efforts toward economic development.
""In the past the big theme was anti-Americanism and anti-imperialism, but this time ... they might talk more about economic achievements rather than being hostile and accusatory to other countries,"" said Lee Woo-young, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul.
""They will emphasize how peace-loving they are and willing for coexistence.""

(This story corrects in fourth paragraph to say Sunday is the 70th anniversary of the founding of North Korea, not ruling Workers' Party)

China resumed ties with Gambia in 2016, after it ended formal relations with Taiwan, claimed by China as a wayward province with no right to diplomatic relations.
Two other African countries have since followed suit, São Tomé and Príncipe and Burkina Faso.
China has stepped up pressure on Taiwan's remaining allies - now down to just 17, most of them poor countries in the Pacific and Central America - as it seeks to limit the democratic island's international footprint.
Meeting Xi in Beijing following this week's China-Africa summit, Barrow told Xi that his country had been wrong to maintain relations with Taiwan.
""The facts prove that Gambia previously maintaining so-called diplomatic relations with Taiwan was a huge mistake,"" China's foreign ministry cited Barrow as saying.
""China has helped us improve communications, roads and transport conditions, things that in all the years gone past we wanted to do but were unable,"" he added.
Barrow said he ""believed that with China's cooperation, Gambia will achieve speeded-up development"", the ministry said.
For years, China and Taiwan have tried to poach each other's allies, often dangling generous aid packages in front of leaders of developing nations.
The kingdom of eSwatini, formerly known as Swaziland, is Taiwan's only remaining African ally. It has shown no desire to ditch Taipei even as China steps up efforts to woo it.
China's renewed diplomatic tussle with Taiwan has also dragged in the United States. While Washington only recognizes China, it has strong unofficial relations with Taiwan and is its main arms supplier.

Last month, the United States attacked El Salvador's decision to abandon Taiwan in favor of China, saying the change was of grave concern and warning that China was offering economic inducements to seek domination.

Prime Minister Theresa May said police and prosecutors now believe the attack on Sergei Skripal was carried out by two Russian military intelligence officers who were almost certainly acting with the approval of senior Russian officials.
Russia has repeatedly denied any involvement and some Russian officials have suggested the British security services carried out that attack to stoke anti-Moscow hysteria. 
Asked whether President Putin bears responsibility, Ben Wallace told BBC radio: ""Ultimately he does in so far as he is the president of the Russian Federation and it is his government that controls, funds and directs the military intelligence."" 
""Ultimately of course he is responsible, he is leader of the state,"" he said.
Skripal, a former colonel in Russian military intelligence who betrayed dozens of agents to Britain's MI6 foreign spy service, and his daughter Yulia, were found unconscious on a public bench in the English city of Salisbury on March 4.
After the attack, allies in Europe and the United States sided with Britain's view of the attack and ordered the biggest expulsion of Russian diplomats since the height of the Cold War. Russia retaliated by expelling Western diplomats.

The motive for attacking Skripal, who was exchanged in a Kremlin-approved spy swap in 2010, is still unclear, as is the motive for using an exotic nerve agent, Novichok, which has such clear links to Russia’s Soviet past.

NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Tropical Depression Gordon was expected on Thursday to dump more rain on central U.S. states, while Hurricane Florence, a monster Category 3 storm, churned toward Bermuda, the National Hurricane Center said. 
Downpours have flooded streets in Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi as the storm headed north and threatened to bring heavy rains to the Mississippi Valley and the Midwest over the next few days, the NHC said. 
Some areas in northwest Mississippi, much of Arkansas and into the Midwest could get up to 7 inches (18 cm) of rain, with isolated amounts reaching 10 inches through Saturday, and is likely to cause flash flooding, the center said. 
The storm, which made landfall late on Tuesday, has caused minimal property damage so far, the NHC said, but a two-year-old girl died when a tree fell on a mobile home in Pensacola, Florida, authorities said.
As of Thursday morning, less than 1,000 homes and businesses remained without power, according to PowerOutages.us as utility companies restored service for tens of thousands of customers across the region. 
Energy companies and port operators along the Gulf Coast took steps to resume normal operations after Gordon shut 9 percent of the region's oil and natural gas production.
Oil prices fell about 1 percent on Wednesday, after fears about the storm eased.
TRACKING TOWARD BERMUDA 
In the Atlantic Ocean, Hurricane Florence, a Category 3 storm on a five-step scale, headed for Bermuda on Thursday, packing maximum sustained winds of 115 miles per hour (mph) (185 km per hour). 
The first major hurricane of the Atlantic season will affect Bermuda's surf by Friday, but it was too early to say whether it would hit land. 
""Swells generated by Florence will begin to affect Bermuda on Friday and will reach portions of the U.S. East Coast over the weekend,"" the agency said. ""These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.""
Florence was 1,170 miles east-southeast of Bermuda on Thursday morning.

Florence will continue to weaken during the next couple of days, but it ""is expected to remain a strong hurricane for the next several days,"" the NHC said.

They are also putting their faith in neighboring Turkey's diplomacy to spare them from military action, which could become a humanitarian disaster.

Around 3 million people live in the rebel stronghold in northwest Syria, which comprises most of Idlib province and adjacent small parts of Latakia, Hama and Aleppo provinces. 
About half of them fled fighting or were transferred there by the government under surrender deals from other parts of Syria as Assad has steadily taken back territory from rebels. 
In April last year, a government warplane dropped sarin on Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib, killing more than 80 civilians, the U.N. Commission of Inquiry has said. It also said Syrian forces have used chemical weapons, including chlorine, more than two dozen times during the war.
Damascus and its ally Russia both deny these charges and say they do not engage in chemical warfare. Idlib residents are fearful and Washington has warned Assad against using chemical weapons in any offensive, promising a response if he does so.
PROTECTION
Russia, Assad's ally, resumed air strikes against insurgents in Idlib on Tuesday following weeks of bombardment and shelling by pro-Syrian government forces in an apparent prelude to a full-scale offensive against the last major rebel enclave.
But Turkey has said it hopes a summit with Iranian and Russian leaders in Tehran on Friday will avert an offensive.
And some people Reuters spoke to in Idlib suspected an offensive may be avoided. 
""I do not believe there will be an attack on Idlib. It's all a media war,"" said 50-year-old former construction worker Jaafar Abu Ahmad from a rural area near Ma'arat al-Nuaman town. ""The great world powers have pre-agreed on us and divided the land.""
Nevertheless, seven years of grinding war have taught Ahmad to be prepared. His family is currently expanding a damp dugout they have been digging and sheltering in from strikes for the past five years, stocking it with food.
""We have been digging in the earth for two months non-stop, me, my wife and children,"" he said. ""This cave is now our protection. We cleaned it recently after it had been neglected for a long time.""
With shelling, air strikes and rhetoric about an impending offensive increasing, a number of local councils across Idlib have come together and asked Turkey for protection. 
""For us in the liberated areas our only guarantor in negotiations is our Turkish brothers,"" said Ahmad Shtaam al-Rashu, the 48-year-old head of Ma'shureen village's local council.
Turkey has erected observation posts along the frontlines between rebels and government forces, and Rashu said Turkey had told them this was a sign of its commitment to protect the people of Idlib. 
Idlib is often described as the ""last refuge"" for rebels and internally displaced civilians, and any offensive threatens new displacement and human misery. 
""As for escaping toward the (Turkish) border, I don't believe we will move from our houses. The bombardment will get us. There is no place left after Idlib,"" said Ahmed al-Shahad. 

""We will fight to the last man, we no longer have any option.""

Far-right groups clashed with police and chased people they deemed to be migrants in the eastern German city of Chemnitz on Aug. 26 after police said a Syrian and an Iraqi had been detained as suspects in the killing of a 35-year-old German man.
""People are annoyed and outraged because of such homicides and I understand that,"" Seehofer told the Rheinische Post newspaper in an interview. ""If I had not been a minister, I would have taken to the streets as a citizen, but of course not with the radicals.""
The protests, during which some members of an 800-strong crowd performed the illegal Hitler salute, laid bare the divisions in Germany over Merkel's decision in 2015 to take in around one million, mostly Muslim asylum seekers.
Seehofer, leader of Bavaria's Christian Social Union (CSU) and a Merkel ally, added: ""I understand it when people protest, but this doesn't make them Nazis.""
Seehofer has taken an increasingly hardline stance on immigration as his party tries to fight off a strong challenge from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) in October's regional election in Bavaria.
The protests in Chemnitz have sparked a debate about whether politicians are being too complacent in the face of rising far-right xenophobia in a country where many had thought the lessons of Germany's Nazi history had been fully learned.
Before his interview for the Rheinische Post, Seehofer was rebuked by politicians and ordinary Germans on social media for telling CSU members at a meeting in the eastern state of Brandenburg on Wednesday: ""Migration is the mother of all problems.""
Asked what she thought about that specific remark by Seehofer, Merkel appeared to distance herself from her interior minister on Thursday in an interview with the RTL broadcaster.
""I say it differently,"" Merkel said. ""Migration presents us with challenges and here we have problems but also successes.""
Lars Klingbeil, secretary general of the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), the junior partner in Merkel's conservative-led coalition, condemned Seehofer's remarks.

Klingbeil tweeted a picture of Seehofer and wrote: ""When I look at this picture, I ask myself whether I'm seeing the father of many problems. I have no more energy for this kind of right-wing, populist nonsense.""

44,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2018 06:16AM ET</span>","U.S., India seal military communications pact, plan more exercises","By Idrees Ali and Sanjeev Miglani
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India and the United States signed an accord on secure military communications that both sides hailed as a breakthrough on Thursday, possibly opening the way for sales of sensitive U.S. military equipment to India.
The pact was signed after U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj and Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for talks aimed at deepening political and security ties.
The world's two largest democracies have drawn closer in recent years, seeking ways to counter-balance China's spreading influence across Asia, notably in Pakistan, Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean.
Before coming to India, Pompeo held talks in Islamabad with Pakistan's new government and generals, aiming to smooth over tensions after President Donald Trump took a tough new line toward Pakistan over longstanding accusations it is not doing enough to root out Afghan Taliban fighters on its territory.
The presence of U.S. troops in Afghanistan has heightened U.S. sensitivity to the rivalry between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan. Washington and New Delhi share concerns over Pakistan-based anti-Western and anti-Indian Islamist militant groups.
The Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) that was sealed on Thursday had been stalled for years because of India's concerns that it would open up its communications network to the U.S. military.
Pompeo said the accord was a ""major step"" forward that officials have previously said would allow the U.S. to transfer high-tech equipment such as armed surveillance drones. New Delhi has been seeking the drones to monitor the Indian Ocean where China, a close ally of Pakistan, has been making repeated forays in recent years.
India and the United States also agreed to open a hotline between their foreign heads and hold joint exercises involving the air force, navy and the army off the eastern Indian coast in 2019, the Indian government said.
""The momentum in our defense partnership has imbued a tremendous positive energy that has elevated India-U.S. relations to unprecedented heights,"" Sitharaman said.
The United States has emerged as India's second largest arms supplier, closing $15 billion worth of deals in the past decade.
Experts believe the signing of the COMCASA agreement could also reduce the chances of the United States imposing sanctions on India for looking to buy Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile systems.
The United States has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia, under which any country engaged with its defense and intelligence sectors could face secondary U.S. sanctions.
However, a new defense bill proposes giving the U.S. president authority to grant waivers when national security interests are at stake.
The United States is also pushing countries to halt oil imports from Iran after Trump withdrew from a 2015 deal between Iran and six world powers that was intended to stall Tehran's developing nuclear capabilities.
India is Iran's top oil buyer after China, and it is seeking a waiver from the United States.
Ahead of the talks in New Delhi, a senior U.S. State Department official said the United States was engaged in ""very detailed conversations"" with India over Washington's request to completely stop India's oil imports from Iran.

""We’re asking all of our partners, not just India, to reduce to zero oil imports from Iran and so I’m confident that will be part of our conversation with India,"" the official told reporters accompanying Pompeo.

PARIS (Reuters) - France's top military official said on Thursday his forces were prepared to carry out strikes on Syrian targets if chemical weapons were used in an expected government offensive to retake the northern province of Idlib. 
Russia, an ally of President Bashar al-Assad, resumed air strikes against insurgents in Idlib on Tuesday after weeks of bombardment and shelling by pro-government Syrian forces in an apparent prelude to a full-scale offensive against the last major enclave held be rebels.
""We are ready to strike if chemical weapons were used again,"" Armed Forces Chief Francois Lecointre told a small group of reporters. ""They can be carried out at national level but it's in our interest to do it with as many partners as possible.""
In April, France, the United States and Britain launched more than 100 missiles at pro-government targets in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack. 
The prospect of an offensive on Idlib alarms aid agencies. The United Nations has said about half of the 3 million people living in rebel-held areas of the northwest have already been displaced. It estimates some 10,000 jihadists are in the area. 
Lecointre said he expected the final pockets of Islamic State resistance in Syria and Iraq to be defeated by the end of November. 
Idlib's fate now appears likely to rest on a summit on Friday in Tehran between the leaders of Russia, Turkey and Iran - a meeting that Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov said would make the situation ""clearer"".
While the United States and its allies have warned of a blood bath, they have made clear they would only intervene should they deem that chemical weapons have been used.
A French military source said the indications were that Russia and its allies wanted to wrap up the Idlib offensive by the end of the year.
The source said Paris believed the United States would maintain its military presence in Kurdish-controlled northwestern regions of Syria given that Washington wanted to limit Iran's influence in Syria.

The latest insider attack occurred in northeastern Takhar province, and came just days after a U.S. soldier was killed by an Afghan policeman in eastern Logar province, the second American to be killed in an insider attack this year.
""The incident happened early Thursday morning, after a local police opened fire on his colleagues sleeping in a checkpoint in Khwaja Ghar district,"" Takhar provincial police spokesman, Khalil Asir said. He said the bodies were later set on fire and burned.
The perpetrator was apparently connected with the Taliban, Asir said, adding that he fled to the group taking weapons.
Insider attacks by Afghan soldiers or police or by attackers wearing uniform have been a major problem in recent years. There are far more insider attacks on Afghan security forces than on Western forces.
Between December and May, there were 47 so-called ""green-on-green"" attacks involving members of the Afghan security forces turning on their colleagues, with casualties from insider attacks up 50 percent, according to a Pentagon report in June.
In a separate incident, 11 members of the security forces were killed after Taliban stormed several checkpoints in the western province of Badghis, late on Wednesday.
The attacks happened in Ab Kamari district, provincial spokesman, Jamshid Shahabi said, adding that in a clash lasting several hours, 24 Taliban insurgents were killed or wounded.

48,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2018 04:50AM ET</span>",U.S. envoy sees Israel keeping Golan Heights forever,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The U.S. ambassador to Israel said in remarks published on Thursday he expected Israel to keep the Golan Heights in perpetuity, in an apparent nod towards its claim of sovereignty over the strategic plateau captured from Syria in a 1967 war.
Foreign governments, including the United States, do not recognise Israel's claim and President Donald Trump's national security adviser has said Washington's policy is unchanged.
However, U.S. ambassador David Friedman suggested Israel was there to stay and said it was possible the United States would consider recognising Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights in the future.
""I personally cannot imagine a situation in which the Golan Heights will be returned to Syria. I frankly cannot imagine a situation in which the Golan Heights is not part of Israel forever,"" he told the right-wing Israel Hayom newspaper.
Friedman said there was ""no one more undeserving of this prize"" - control of the Golan Heights - than Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Since early in Trump's term, Israel has lobbied for formal U.S. endorsement of its control of the Golan. Trump has recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital, breaking with other world powers, but national security adviser John Bolton said last month a similar Golan move was not under discussion.
In the past year and a half, Trump has twice ordered U.S.-led air strikes against targets in Syria in response to what Washington called the Assad government's use of chemical weapons against civilians.
""Relinquishing the high ground of the Golan Heights could put Israel at a great security disadvantage,"" Friedman said.
The Golan Heights form a buffer between Israel and Syria of about 1,200 square km (460 square miles).
Israel captured most of it from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war. Israel annexed the territory in 1981, a move not recognised internationally.
Once willing to consider returning the Golan for peace with Syria, the Israelis have argued in recent years that the civil war in Syria and the presence there of an Iranian garrison backing Damascus show they need to keep it. 
Interviewed by Reuters last month, Bolton said: ""Obviously we understand the Israeli claim that it has annexed the Golan Heights - we understand their position - but there’s no change in the U.S. position for now.""
Responding to those remarks, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there ""no way"" he would give up to trying to win U.S. recognition.

Asked, in light of Bolton's comments, whether it was possible the Trump administration would consider at a future date recognising Israeli sovereignty, Friedman said: ""Yes, that's definitely possible. It definitely could happen.""

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thousands of Thais will feast royally in the capital on Thursday to celebrate the rescue of 12 boys and their soccer coach from a flooded cave, a dramatic and highly dangerous mission that gripped the world for more than two weeks.
The team will be guests of honor at a government-sponsored dinner to thank those involved in the rescue at Bangkok's Royal Plaza, a large public square in the heart of city's old quarter.
The dinner, partly sponsored by King Maha Vajiralongkorn, will cater for 10,000 guests, including foreign divers and cavers, according to the prime minister's office.
All but one member of the ""Wild Boars"" team were last seen in public last month, their heads shaved after completing time as Buddhist monks in the northern province of Chiang Rai - a gesture to give thanks for their safe return and in memory of one Thai rescuer who died. 
The boys and their 25-year-old coach, Ekapol Chanthawong, were exploring Chiang Rai's Tham Luang cave on June 23 when they became trapped. They survived nine days on water dripping from rocks before they were discovered on a muddy mound by divers.
The boys and their coach attended an exhibition at a Bangkok shopping mall to celebrate their rescue where they said they had pretty much resumed their old routines.
""Things are back to normal, except now I have more friends,"" said Chanin Wiboonrungruang, 11, the youngest of the group, with a big smile.
Wearing yellow shirts and baseball caps, the boys recounted their ordeal and the moment rescuers found them.
""It is indescribable how glad we were,"" said Ekapol. 

The rescue involved divers and volunteers from all over the world and ended on July 10 when the last of the group was brought to safety.

Eritrean and Ethiopian leaders have moved swiftly in the past two months to end two decades of hostility since conflict erupted in 1998.
Fana Broadcasting said Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki had reopened the embassy in Asmara in a brief ceremony and it named Redwan Hussein as the new Ethiopian ambassador.
In July, Eritrea reopened its embassy in Ethiopia and named an ambassador to represent it.
Abiy held his second face-to-face meeting with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki on Wednesday since the July accord.
The two are due to hold a summit meeting later on Thursday with Somalia's President Mohamed Abdullahi. 

It is Abdullahi's second visit to Eritrea since July 30 and the latest sign of thawing relations across the Horn of Africa following Eritrea's rapprochement with Ethiopia.

51,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2018 03:06AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Right-wing sites swamp Sweden with 'junk news' in tight election race,"By Jack Stubbs and Johan Ahlander
LONDON/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - One in three news articles shared online about the upcoming Swedish election come from websites publishing deliberately misleading information, most with a right-wing focus on immigration and Islam, Oxford University researchers say.
Their study, published on Thursday, points to widespread online disinformation in the final stages of a tightly-contested campaign which could mark a lurch to the right in one of Europe's most prominent liberal democracies. 
The authors, from the Oxford Internet Institute, labeled certain websites ""junk news"", based on a range of detailed criteria. Reuters found the three most popular sites they identified have employed former members of the Sweden Democrats party; one has a former MP listed among its staff.
It was not clear whether the sharing of ""junk news"" had affected voting intentions in Sweden, but the study helps show the impact platforms such as Twitter and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) have on elections, and how domestic or foreign groups can use them to exacerbate sensitive social and political issues.
Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, whose center-left Social Democrats have dominated politics since 1914 but are now unlikely to secure a ruling majority, told Reuters the spread of false or distorted information online risked shaking ""the foundations of democracy"" if left unchecked.
The Institute, a department of Oxford University, analyzed 275,000 tweets about the Swedish election from a 10-day period in August. It counted articles shared from websites it identified as ""junk news"" sources, defined as outlets which ""deliberately publish misleading, deceptive or incorrect information purporting to be real news"". 
""Roughly speaking, for every two professional content articles shared, one junk news article was shared. Junk news therefore constituted a significant part of the conversation around the Swedish general election,"" it said.
A Twitter spokesman declined to comment on the results of the study.
Facebook, where interactions between users are harder to track, said it was working with Swedish officials to help voters spot disinformation. It has also partnered with Viralgranskaren - an arm of Sweden's Metro newspaper - to identify, demote and counterbalance ""false news"" on its site.
Joakim Wallerstein, head of communications for the Sweden Democrats, said he had no knowledge of or interest in the party sympathies of media outlets. Asked to comment on his party's relationship with the sites identified by the study, he said he had been interviewed by one of them once.
""I think it is strange that a foreign institute is trying to label various news outlets in Sweden as 'junk news' and release such a report in connection to an election,"" he said. 
""DECEPTIVE TOOLS""
Swedish security officials say there is currently no evidence of a coordinated online attempt by foreign powers to sway the Sept. 9 vote, despite repeated government warnings about the threat.
But Mikael Tofvesson, head of the counter influence team at the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB), a government agency tasked with safeguarding the election, said the widespread sharing of false or distorted information makes countries more vulnerable to hostile influence operations. 
""Incorrect and biased reporting promotes a harder, harsher tone in the debate, which makes it easier to throw in disinformation and other deceptive tools,"" he said.
Lisa-Maria Neudert, a researcher from the Oxford Internet Institute's Project on Computational Propaganda, said most of the ""junk news"" in Sweden supported right-wing policies, and was largely focused on issues around immigration and Islam.
The top three ""junk news"" sources identified by the study - right-wing websites Samhallsnytt, Nyheter Idag and Fria Tider - accounted for more than 85 percent of the ""junk news"" content.
Samhallsnytt received donations through the personal bank account of a Sweden Democrat member between 2011-2013 when it operated under the name Avpixlat. A former Sweden Democrat member of parliament, who also previously ran the party's youth wing, is listed on the Samhallsnytt website as a columnist.
Samhallsnytt often publishes articles saying Sweden is under threat from Islam. In June, for example, it said a youth soccer tournament in the second-biggest city had banned pork as ""haram"" - or forbidden under Islamic law. The article is still online with the headline: ""Islam is the new foundation of the Gothia Cup - pork proclaimed 'haram'"".
A tournament organizer told the Dagens Nyheter newspaper that caterers had not served pork for more than 10 years for practical reasons, and there was no ban against eating or selling pork at the event. 
Samhallsnytt and Fria Tider did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
Commenting before the Oxford study was published, Nyheter Idag founder Chang Frick disputed the ""junk news"" label and said his website followed ethical journalistic practices, citing its membership of Sweden's self-regulated Press Council body.
""Yes, we put our editorial perspective on news, of course, like everyone else,"" he said. ""If you are doing a tabloid you cannot have dry, boring headlines, it should have some punch to it. But we do not lie, we do not make false accusations.""
FACT CHECKERS AND BOTS
Social media companies have come under increasing pressure to tackle disinformation on their platforms following accusations that Russia and Iran tried to meddle in domestic politics in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. Moscow and Tehran deny the allegations.A report by the Swedish Defence Research Institute last week said the number of automated Twitter accounts discussing the upcoming election almost doubled in July from the previous month. Such so-called ""bot"" accounts shared articles from Samhallsnytt and Fria Tider more frequently than real people, the report said, and were 40 percent more likely to express support for the Sweden Democrats.
Facebook said its work with Viralgranskaren to fact check content on its sites helped it quickly identify ""false news."" 
The company declined to give specific figures about the amount or sources of false news it had recorded around the Swedish election, but said any flagged content is given a lower position on its site, a practice known as ""downranking"" which it says cuts views by 80 percent. Users who see disputed articles are also shown other sources of verified information, it said.
In a blog post on its website, Twitter says it ""should not be the arbiter of truth"".

But the MSB's counter influence team's head Tofvesson said there had been a ""positive increase"" in the work of Facebook, Twitter and other social media companies to help safeguard the election, largely via better communication and coordination with local authorities.

52,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2018 02:21AM ET</span>",Malaysian PM says caning of lesbians counter to 'compassion of Islam',"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Thursday denounced the caning of two Muslim women for attempting lesbian sex, a sentence that sparked outrage and raised fears about the treatment of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. 
The women had pleaded guilty to charges under Islamic laws forbidding lesbian sex. They were caned on Monday in front of dozens of people at a sharia court in Terengganu, a conservative state in the east, prompting an outcry from human rights activists, who described the punishment as torture.
Mahathir's government has appeared divided about the LGBT community, while the premier himself had been silent on the caning and recent attacks on transgender people and marginalized groups in the Muslim-majority country. 
In a video posted on his Twitter account, Mahathir said the caning ""did not reflect the justice or compassion of Islam"".
It was the women's first offence, he said, which warranted a lighter sentence, such as counseling.
""This gives a bad impression of Islam,"" the 93-year-old leader said. ""It is important that we show Islam is not a cruel religion that likes to impose harsh sentences to humiliate others."" 
The LGBT community is routinely persecuted in Malaysia, where it is seen as a threat to conservative values.
Mahathir's government swept into power in May after campaigning on a reform agenda, but has been unconvincing in its handling of matters relating to race, religion and minorities in the multi-racial country.
The caning followed a series of incidents in recent weeks that civil rights groups say illustrate growing hostility against gay and transgender people. 
Last month, a gay bar in Kuala Lumpur was raided by police and religious enforcement officials, while a transgender woman was beaten up by a group of assailants in Seremban, near the capital. 
The minister in charge of Islamic affairs also came under fire, including from other ruling party lawmakers, after he ordered the removal of portraits of two LGBT activists from an art exhibition.
Malaysia describes oral and anal sex as against the order of nature. Civil law stipulates jail for up to 20 years, caning and fines for offenders, although enforcement of the law is rare.

Muslims are also governed by state-level Islamic laws, most of which carry provisions outlawing same-sex acts.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Neither of Sweden's main political blocs is likely to win a majority in an election on Sunday, giving the far-right Sweden Democrats a key role in shaping the next government.
The center-left bloc, uniting the minority governing Social Democrat and Green parties with the Left Party, is backed by about 40 percent of voters, recent opinion polls show, a slim lead over the center-right Alliance bloc.
The Sweden Democrats, who oppose immigration and Sweden's continued membership of the European Union, are polling around 18 percent of the vote and would thus hold the balance of power.
Doing a deal with them would give either bloc a majority. But all the mainstream parties have ruled out cooperating with a party which has roots in the white supremacist fringe, making forming a new government fraught with difficulty.
Parties are holding their cards close to their chests, but there are a number of options that could break the impasse.
CENTER-RIGHT MINORITY RULE 
Although the Alliance of the Moderates, Centre, Liberals and Christian Democrats may be smaller than the center-left after the vote, it can probably rely on some kind of support from the Sweden Democrats to oust Prime Minister Stefan Lofven.
A center-right coalition government is seen as the most likely option by bookmakers.
However, a formal agreement with the Sweden Democrats would very likely see the Centre and Liberal parties, who want looser immigration policies, jump ship. 
The Sweden Democrats have been clear they want influence over policy, particularly on immigration, in return for support.
""We are prepared to bring down any government we think is not leading Sweden in the right direction,"" Sweden Democrats leader Jimmie Akesson told Reuters in a July interview.
SOCIAL DEMOCRATS AND GREENS CLING ON
The Social Democrats and Greens could theoretically retain power if the center-left is the biggest bloc and in the unlikely event that Prime Minister Stefan Lofven survives a mandatory parliament vote after the election on whether to replace him.
When voting for a prime minister in parliament, a proposal is passed unless a majority of the Riksdag's 349 MPs vote against. This has allowed minority governments to rule.
Lofven could survive if the Sweden Democrats decide not to back the Alliance in calling for a new prime minister in protest at the Alliance rejecting their policies.
He might also be able to continue if the Alliance's Centre and Liberal parties abstain.
The Centre and Liberals have said they do not want to split the Alliance, but that they would look for some kind of cross-party arrangement if it ends up being smaller. Their decision is likely to be key, but they have deliberately avoided specifics.
A GRAND COALITION
The Alliance could join a grand coalition with the Social Democrats and possibly the Greens to exclude the Sweden Democrats. The Left Party, Sweden's former Communist party, would also probably be left out. 
But the Moderates - the biggest party in the Alliance - are not interested in cooperating with the Social Democrats and such a deal would also raise questions about democratic accountability. Voters might see the Sweden Democrats as the country's only opposition party. 
SWEDEN DEMOCRATS BECOMING BIGGEST PARTY
The biggest party does not necessarily get to rule in Sweden. The Social Democrats were bigger than the Moderates from 2006-2014 when the Alliance governed.
Polls put the Sweden Democrats some way behind the 25 percent support the Social Democrats enjoy. But polls have underestimated support for Jimmie Akesson's party in the past.
If the Sweden Democrats get top spot, that would put extra pressure on the other parties to either come to an agreement with each other to keep them out or to recognize that democratic legitimacy demands that Akesson's party be given a say. 
Both options would be divisive.
MODERATE ONE-PARTY RULE 
The Moderates could form a one-party government. That would require support from the Sweden Democrats as well as the smaller center-right parties. 
Moderate leader Ulf Kristersson has ruled this out and the Centre and Liberal parties would probably not go along if the Sweden Democrats were given any significant say over policy even while remaining outside the government. 
NEW VOTE 
The speaker of parliament has four goes at giving prime ministerial candidates a run at forming a government. If they all fail, fresh elections must be called. 
There is no formal time limit for negotiations, but the deadline for the budget is Nov. 15. 
If no new government is in place by then, the current government, continuing as care-takers, would put forward a budget until a new cabinet can take office.

54,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2018 01:10AM ET</span>",Nauru demands China apologize for 'disrespect' at Pacific forum,"WELLINGTON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - The tiny Micronesian state of Nauru is demanding a formal apology after a dispute with China's representative at this week's Pacific Islands Forum brought to the surface tensions with Beijing over its support for Taiwan.
Nauru, an island country of roughly 12,000 inhabitants, hosted leaders of 18 Pacific nations, plus delegations from non-member countries including the United States and China, for the forum.
The spat occurred when Nauru's President Baron Waqa refused to give way when the head of the Chinese delegation, diplomat Du Qiwen, demanded to be allowed to address the forum before the Prime Minister of Tuvalu on Tuesday. 
Waqa described China's envoy as ""very insolent"" and a ""bully"" for speaking out of turn.
Nauru and Tuvalu are two of six Pacific countries to have diplomatic ties with Taiwan, which is a major source of tension with China, which regards Taiwan as a wayward province, to be taken back by force if necessary.
During a media conference that followed the leaders' meeting at the forum late on Wednesday, Nauru's president was asked whether he would seek a formal apology from China over its envoy's behavior.
""We will go further than that, I tell you we won't just seek an apology, we will actually get the forum to do it...as well as our own and we will even take it up to the UN,"" Waqa said.
""Never mind they are big, they are our partners, they should not disrespect us.""
China's Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but on Wednesday had said that Nauru had violated international norms and the rules of forum.
Chinese state-run tabloid Global Times said in an editorial that the dispute was connected to Nauru's recognition of Taiwan.
""Taiwan should not believe there is still an opportunity for its ""diplomacy"" just because of Nauru's actions. It's absurd that Taiwan's future can be decided by a remote Pacific island country,"" the paper said on Thursday.
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry also did not immediately respond to request for comment.
Waqa said that he had not allowed China to speak as protocol dictated that he allow prime ministers and ministers to speak before diplomats.
""I have to be strong here because no one is to come and dictate things for us,"" Waqa said. ""It's about the way they treated us, they're not our friends. They just use us for their own purpose, for their own will.""
The forum is set to end on Thursday.
China has become one of the dominant economic players in the Pacific, spending billions of dollars in trade, investment, aid and tourism in a region that staunch U.S. ally Australia has long regarded as its ""back yard"".
Chinese lending to the region has surged from nearly zero to $1.3 billion over the last decade, stoking concern that tiny nations could end up overburdened and in debt.
Tuvalu is set to host the Pacific Island Forum in 2019 and Waqa said some states had suggested changing the rules around which forum events countries with 'dialogue partner' status, including China, would be allowed to speak. 

Meg Taylor, Secretary General of the Pacific Islands Forum, said at the media conference that the rule change and protocols for meetings would be considered in the first quarter of 2019.

Only 23 percent of those surveyed reported a favorable opinion of Macron in September, down from 27 percent last month, the YouGov poll for Le Huff Post and CNEWS found.
Macron's popularity is low in most polls but the YouGov survey pegged it worse than others and indicated poor ratings across the political spectrum.
The former investment banker has sold his pro-business reform drive on promises that it will boost growth and jobs, but many voters ranging from conservative pensioners to low-income workers complain his policies mostly benefit companies and the rich.
He was dealt a blow last week with the surprise resignation of his environment minister, a popular former activist and TV presenter, during a live radio interview.
In July his leadership was put to the test when a scandal broke out as video emerged showing his top bodyguard beating May Day protestErs.
Meanwhile, soft economic data has raised questions about whether he has the right recipe for growth while hesitation over a tax collection reform has painted him as unusually indecisive.
His government has repeatedly shrugged off poor poll ratings, insisting it will not waver on the reform agenda as politically sensitive overhauls of unemployment insurance and pensions loom in the months ahead.

The YouGov poll was conducted on Aug. 29-30 with a sample of 1,099 people.

More than 300 people have been killed and 2,000 injured in crackdowns by Nicaraguan police and armed groups in protests that began in April over an abortive plan by leftist President Daniel Ortega's government to reduce welfare benefits.
The protests soon escalated into broader opposition against Ortega, who has been in office since 2007. He also served a term as president during the 1980s when he was a notable Cold War antagonist of the United States during Nicaragua's civil war.
In a speech before the United Nations Security Council, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said that if the situation in Nicaragua continued to worsen, it could cause a spike in migrants fleeing into neighboring countries.
""When human rights are denied, the violence and instability that follow spill over borders,"" she said, comparing Nicaragua to Venezuela, which has seen more than 1.6 million people leave since 2015, according to the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR.
""With each passing day, Nicaragua travels further down a familiar path,"" Haley said. ""It is a path that Syria has taken. It is a path that Venezuela has taken.""
At the Security Council meeting, Nicaragua's government rejected Haley's contention. Later in the day Ortega reminded a cheering crowd of supporters that the United States had an ""expansionist"" history in the Central American country.
""What do we say to the United States? That if they want to help the people of Nicaragua, if they want to contribute to peace, the best thing they can do, and should do, is not interfere in Nicaragua, and respect Nicaragua,"" Ortega said in the capital Managua. 
At the U.N. meeting, the representative for neighboring Costa Rica said that the country had seen a ""significant increase"" in requests for asylum from Nicaraguans since the protests began: a total of 12,830 in the first eight months of the year.
That pales in comparison with war-ravaged Syria's estimated 5.5 million refugees, a number almost equivalent to the entire population of Nicaragua.
""There is consensus in this (Council) that Nicaragua does not represent a threat to international peace and security,"" said Nicaragua's foreign minister Denis Moncada.
The U.N. Security Council is charged with maintaining international peace and security.
Representatives from Russia, Bolivia and Venezuela backed the Nicaraguan government in arguing that the situation in the country was not undermining the region's stability.
Moncada called Nicaragua a model of security in the region in the battle against organized crime, and said that its inclusion on the agenda was a breach of international law.
Last week, the U.N. human rights delegation released a report documenting human rights violations in recent months, including the disproportionate use of force and extrajudicial killings by the Nicaraguan police, disappearances, arbitrary detentions and instances of torture and sexual violence.

Shortly afterwards, Nicaragua's government ordered the expulsion of the delegation.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A wildfire erupted in forest land in Northern California on Wednesday, forcing the evacuation of dozens of homes and the closure of a stretch of an interstate highway near where a deadly blaze broke out in July, officials said.
The Delta Fire was burning in timber and brush in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest in a canyon along the Sacramento River.
It was near the site of the Carr Fire, which led to eight deaths and destroyed hundreds of homes in the city of Redding and nearby areas.
Wildfires in California have scorched far more ground this year than in 2017, one of the most destructive in the state's history.
The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection has responded to 4,587 fires that have destroyed 613,710 acres (248,359 hectares), compared with 4,425 fires that destroyed 233,936 acres (94,671 hectares) through the same period in 2017, according to figures from the agency
The latest fire spread to 2,000 acres (809 hectares) by Wednesday evening, forcing the Shasta County Sheriff's Office to evacuate residents along a stretch of Interstate 5 north of the town of Lakehead to the Siskiyou County line, according to the government wildfire tracking website Inciweb. 
""It's not in the middle of a town, but there are some rural residences"" in the area, Shasta-Trinity National Forest spokeswoman Carol Underhill said.
A representative from the Shasta County Sheriff's Office could no immediately be reached for comment.
The Delta Fire was burning on both sides of Interstate 5, which has made it more difficult to control the flames, Underhill said. The highway has been closed in both directions in that area.
Firefighters have not been able to build any containment lines against the fast-moving blaze, officials with the Shasta-Trinity National Forest said on Twitter. 
Photos posted online by the U.S. Forest Service showed bright orange flames in a forest just beyond a truck on a highway, and broad columns of white smoke rising above forests. 

The fire broke out at mid-day on Wednesday near an exit from Interstate 5, about 30 miles (48 km) north of Redding. Its cause was under investigation.

The administration of President Jimmy Morales said on Tuesday it had barred Ivan Velasquez, head of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), from entry and asked the United Nations to send a replacement.
Morales has been in a long-running dispute with Velasquez, who has tried to impeach the president for corruption and also targeted members of his family over suspected graft. Morales, a former comedian, has denied any wrongdoing.
The government accuses the CICIG leader of undermining Guatemala's stability and its justice system. But following the order to deny him entry, the country's human rights ombudsman and other supporters of Velasquez appealed the decision.
""The presidency and the National Security Council were asked to submit reports because four appeals were presented yesterday questioning the president's decision,"" said Martin Guzman, secretary general of Guatemala's Constitutional Court.
The Guatemalan government has 48 hours to respond to the court's requests on the Velasquez ban, Guzman said.
If the government fails to justify its decision, a provisional appeal against his expulsion could be granted, allowing Velasquez to return.
A few dozen people protested the CICIG's treatment outside the court, accusing the government of corruption and offering their support for Velasquez, a veteran Colombian prosecutor.
Velasquez met in the United States on Wednesday with Guatemalan-born U.S. Representative Norma Torres, who in a statement called the decision to bar the CICIG chief ""ridiculous"" and accused Morales of trying to protect himself from investigation.

The latest tensions followed an announcement on Friday by Morales that the commission's mandate would end next September. In it, Morales attacked the CICIG, which helped bring down his predecessor as president with a corruption probe.

The investigation involves 10 million reais ($2.41 million) in illicit funds Temer's Brazilian Democratic Party allegedly received from construction firm Odebrecht [ODBES.UL] in 2014, according to the police document.
Odebrecht made the alleged payment in 2014, when Temer was vice president. 
Temer's office said in a written statement that the president had done no wrongdoing and that the funds received from Odebrecht were legal campaign donations.
Brazil's Prosecutor General Raquel Dodge requested in March that Temer be investigated despite the constitution barring him from standing trial for crimes committed before he became president as long as he remains in power. 
The police document indicated that mines and energy minister Wellington Moreira Franco and Temer's chief of staff Eliseu Padilha were also involved in the alleged scheme and requested they face corruption charges. 
Requests for comment from Moreira Franco and Padilha were not immediately returned. 
Under Brazilian law, at the conclusion of an investigation police must request that prosecutors make any formal charges. If they do so, it is then up to a judge to decide if the charges merit a trial.
Dodge's office did not return after hours calls seeking comment, and it was not clear if or when she would decide to act on the police requests for corruption charges. 
Temer has already faced previous corruption charges, which were blocked by Congress last year. Under Brazilian law, congressmen must approve any charges related to conduct in office against a sitting president, who could then only be tried before the Supreme Court.

Once Temer leaves office on Jan. 1, he could still face the charges that Congress blocked and any new charges that may be filed against him while still in office.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A powerful earthquake triggered a landslide that engulfed houses on Japan's northern island of Hokkaido early on Thursday, television footage showed, injuring and trapping dozens of people and cutting power to millions across Hokkaido.
A landslide along a long ridge in the rural town of Atsuma could be seen in aerial footage from public broadcaster NHK. At least 19 people were missing and 120 people were injured in Hokkaido after the magnitude 6.7 quake, it said.
There were no early reports of deaths but a man suffered cardiac arrest after falling down stairs, Japanese media reported.
Japan's Hokkaido Electric Power Co (T:9509) said it conducted an emergency shutdown of all its fossil fuel-fired power plants after the quake, leading to blackouts across Hokkaido.
Efforts to restore power to 2.95 million households were underway but it was not clear when supplies would be restored, a company spokesman said.
Japan's Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshige Seko said the ministry instructed Hokkaido Electric Power to restart the coal-fired Tomato-Atsuma power plant within a few hours.
Roof tiles and water covered floors at Hokkaido's main airport, New Chitose Airport, which would be closed for at least Thursday.
Kansai Airport, an important hub for companies exporting semiconductors in western Japan, remained closed due to a powerful typhoon earlier this week.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said officials hope to reopen Kansai Airport for domestic flights on Friday.
FIRE, POWER OUTAGES
The quake, which struck at 3:08 a.m. (1808 GMT Wednesday) posed no tsunami risk, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. The U.S. Geological Survey said it struck some 68 km (42 miles) southeast of Sapporo, Hokkaido's main city.
Abe arrived at his office before 6 a.m. and told reporters his government had set up a command center to coordinate relief and rescue. Sounding haggard, Abe said saving lives was his government's top priority.
The Tomari Nuclear Power Station suffered a power outage but was cooling its fuel rods safely with emergency power, said Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga. Operator Hokkaido Electric Power Co (T:9509) reported no radiation irregularities at the plant, which has been shut since shortly after a massive 2011 earthquake, Suga told a news conference. 
A fire broke out at a Mitsubishi Steel Mfg Co (T:5632) plant in the city of Muroran after the quake but was mostly extinguished with no injuries, a company official said.
A row of houses could be seen slanting at odd angles, leaning against one another in one town, and many schools were closed, NHK said.
NHK footage showed a crumbled brick wall and broken glass in a home, and quoted police as saying some people were trapped in collapsed structures.
Soldiers were shown looking for damage on a rural road that was blocked by fallen trees.
A series of smaller shocks, including one with a magnitude of 5.4, followed the initial quake, the Meteorological Agency said. Agency official Toshiyuki Matsumori warned residents to take precautions for potential major aftershocks in coming days.
Shinkansen bullet trains were halted in some areas of Hokkaido, NHK said.
Japan is situated on the ""Ring of Fire"" arc of volcanoes and oceanic trenches that partly encircles the Pacific Basin and accounts for about 20 percent of the world's earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater.
A 9.0 magnitude earthquake, the most powerful ever recorded in Japan, struck on March 11, 2011, under the ocean off the coast of the northern city of Sendai. The quake set off a series of massive tsunami that devastated a wide swath of the Pacific coastline and killed nearly 20,000 people. 
The tsunami also damaged the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, leading to a series of explosions and meltdowns in the world's worst nuclear disaster for 25 years.

Saturday marked the 95th anniversary of the Great Kanto earthquake, which had a magnitude of 7.9 and killed more than 140,000 people in the Tokyo area. Seismologists have said another such quake could strike the city at any time.

The Houthi-run al-Masirah TV said on Twitter the group had hit a Saudi National Guard camp in the border city. The Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis said the missile launched from Saada province had been detected at 2008 (1708 GMT).
The Iran-aligned Houthi militants, who control Yemen's capital Sanaa and most of the west of the country, regularly fire missiles on southern Saudi Arabia and occasionally aim for higher-value targets, such as the capital Riyadh or facilities of state oil company Aramco.
Most of the missiles have been intercepted by the Saudi military. At least 112 civilians have been killed in such attacks since 2015, according to the coalition.
Saudi civil defense said two children were among the wounded in the latest missile interception. Eleven of the victims were taken to hospital for treatment.
Saudi Arabia is leading a Western-backed alliance of Sunni Muslim Arab states trying to restore the internationally recognized government of Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, ousted from the capital Sanaa by the Houthis in 2015.
U.N. mediator Martin Griffiths told reporters in Geneva that Yemen's first round of peace talks in almost three years aims to build confidence between the warring sides.

Jose Armando Constantino, the director of analysis of accidents and incidents for Mexico's civil aviation agency, said there was no evidence of human error or mechanical failures.
""There is no evidence that the motors had a mechanical or technical problem,"" he told a news conference. 
""The air speed indicates there were many fluctuations, there was an external factor. The external factor is a microburst, the probable cause (of the accident) was due to meteorological factors,"" he said.
The Mexico City-bound Embraer jet smashed into scrubland near the runway shortly after take-off during what passengers have described as strong winds, hail and rain. All 103 passengers and crew survived by evacuating from the plane before it caught fire.
Investigators have found no evidence indicating that the crew should have known not to take off, Constantino said. A pilot in training served as copilot while the plane was taking off, he said.
The agency will later present a final report detailing its findings about the accident. 

Arturo Duhart, Aeromexico's director of corporate security, said all passengers and crew involved in the accident have been discharged from hospital. Eleven U.S. passengers who survived the crash sued the airline in August.

AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - A federal judge blocked Texas laws requiring the burial or cremation of aborted fetal tissue, saying in a decision on Wednesday the measures placed substantial and unconstitutional obstacles in the path of a woman's right to choose an abortion.
U.S. District Judge David Ezra in Austin, Texas, issued a permanent injunction preventing the measures from going into effect. 
""The evidence in this case overwhelmingly demonstrated that if the challenged laws were to go into effect now, they would likely cause a near catastrophic failure of the healthcare system designed to serve women of childbearing age within the State of Texas,"" Ezra wrote in a decision posted in online records.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs, who include abortion providers, said women could already seek burial or cremation of fetal tissue under current state law. 
They said the law placed an arbitrary burden on women's beliefs by requiring a burial ritual and could place providers under threat of closure if they could not find ways to abide by the measures.
Lawyers for Texas argued the laws would protect human dignity and have no impact on abortion providers.
Texas began crafting regulations on fetal tissue disposal in 2016, shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down separate abortion restrictions regarding doctors and facilities.
The proposed Texas requirements were more stringent than those in almost every other state, which generally allow aborted fetal tissue to be disposed of in a similar manner as other human tissue, typically through incineration and disposal in a sanitary landfill, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which monitors reproductive health laws.
In June 2017, Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed abortion restrictions into law, including the requirement on disposal of fetal tissue.
Ezra, who had temporarily halted the law, has said he wanted to keep the proceedings from being influenced by speculation a new U.S. Supreme Court justice could alter national abortion law. 
Republicans are hoping the Senate will confirm Brett Kavanaugh, a conservative U.S. appeals court judge nominated by President Donald Trump to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, before the court's next term opens in October.
Abortion rights advocates worry Kavanaugh could change the balance on the Supreme Court in favor of more restrictions or even help overturn the court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion. 

During his Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday, Kavanaugh signaled respect for Roe v. Wade, calling it an important legal precedent that had been reaffirmed by the justices over the decades.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Thousands of Sri Lankan opposition demonstrators led by former leader Mahinda Rajapaksa blocked a main road in Colombo on Wednesday in protest at economic hardship and the delaying of provincial polls. 
Police did not give an estimate but independent analysts said the number of demonstrators in the capital could be well over 15,000, mainly from rural Sri Lanka.
They blocked a main road near the finance and defense ministries, disrupting traffic, and thousands also gathered on nearby streets late into the evening.
The coalition government of President Maithripala Sirisena's center-left Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's United National Party (UNP) is under fire for sluggish economic growth.
The opposition said the protest was to force the government to hold delayed provincial council polls. The authorities have said the delays are due to deliberations about a possible new electoral system.
""The people's democratic rights are being violated by postponing elections,"" said Rajapaksa at the protest. 
""The situation is going from bad to worse. The country is heading toward an autocratic form of governance rather a democratic rule. Therefore, it is our responsibility to restore democracy by forming a new government.""
Namal Rajapaksa, the legislator son of the former leader, said the protest was the first step toward bringing down the government and forcing it to hold early national elections. 
""People are frustrated against unreasonable taxes and economic hardships,"" Namal told Reuters.
The government, however, said the protest was nothing to do with provincial council elections or economic suffering.
""They want to divert the focus of misappropriation probes against their legislators and stop the ongoing state mechanisms,"" junior Home Affairs Minister J.C. Alawathuwala told reporters in Colombo. 
Nalin Bandara, junior Public Administration minister, said the government had advised the 5,000 police deployed for the protest to allow opposition supporters to practise their democratic rights and freedom of expression. 
The coalition government has initiated probes against Rajapaksa's family members including his two brothers and sons and many allies in relation to alleged corruption and financial misappropriation. However, the investigations are going slowly and the opposition has said they are politically motivated.

Rajapaksa was ousted in 2015 amid allegations of human rights abuses, threatening journalists and rights defenders, and corruption. Rajapaksa and his family deny any wrongdoing.

France's Europhile leader is seeking to build a loose, pan-European campaign of like-minded progressives to hold back the tide of anti-immigrant nationalists.
""The idea is to make a coalition that brings progressives together around a joint platform transcending well-structured existing political families,"" a source at the Elysee presidential palace said.
""We are at an important moment for Europe where we've got to rebuild ourselves because the nationalists won't hesitate to rebuild themselves. So we must not remain prisoners of political badges,"" the source added.
Campaigning for the May 23 and 26 election is likely to get under way in full early next year, which means the joint platform has to be thrashed out ""around December-January,"" the source said.
Manfred Weber, 46, who leads the pan-EU conservative group in the European Parliament, said on Wednesday he would seek nomination as the European People's Party's lead candidate for the election with the aim of then taking over as president of the European Commission.
Meanwhile, Macron has been active in reaching out to possible allies around Europe for a campaign confounding traditional party moulds, much as he did in his successful bid for the French presidency in 2017.
The Elysee source downplayed the importance of having a lead candidate to embody the new political movement, saying that was not voters' priority.

Israel's immediate reaction highlights its sensitivity over the status of Jerusalem, which it regards as its capital. Most countries do not recognize Israeli sovereignty over the entire city and say its final status should be set in peace negotiations.
The decision by Paraguay's new president, Mario Abdo, to move the embassy from Jerusalem back to Tel Aviv reversed the initiative of his predecessor Horacio Cartes, less than four months ago.
The Palestinians said their foreign minister, Riyad al-Maliki, met Abdo two weeks ago and hailed Paraguay's change of mind as ""a new Palestinian diplomatic achievement.""
""Minister Maliki exerted a big effort during his meeting with the new president who instructed his foreign minister to arrange the issue,"" the Palestinian foreign ministry said in a statement.
Explaining the new Paraguayan move, the country's foreign minister, Luis Alberto Castiglioni, said: ""Paraguay wants to contribute to an intensification of regional diplomatic efforts to achieve a broad, fair and lasting peace in the Middle East."" 
Israel acted swiftly after the news broke and a statement in English from the Prime Minister's office said: ""Israel views with utmost gravity the extraordinary decision by Paraguay which will cloud bilateral relations.""
The status of Jerusalem is one of the thorniest obstacles to forging a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians.
Israel regards all of the city, including the eastern sector that it annexed after the 1967 war, as its capital. 
But the Palestinians, with broad international backing, want East Jerusalem for the capital of a future state they hope to establish in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Negotiations between the two sides broke down in 2014.
In December, U.S. President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, reversing decades of U.S. policy and upsetting the Arab world and Western allies. It opened a new embassy in the city on May 14. Two days later, Guatemala opened its embassy in Jerusalem.
The following week, Cartes traveled to Israel to inaugurate the new embassy personally and Paraguay became the third country to set its mission in Jerusalem.
Cartes was replaced by Mario Abdo, also a member of the conservative Colorado party, last month.
Netanyahu, who is also Israel's foreign minister, has attempted to persuade other countries to follow their lead.

On Wednesday while meeting Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, Netanyahu said: ""I appreciate your decision to open an honorary consulate in Jerusalem, and I hope, I hope, I hope it's the first step toward establishing the Bulgarian embassy in Jerusalem.""

In May, Trump withdrew the United States from a 2015 international agreement intended to stall Tehran's nuclear capabilities and has since reimposed sanctions suspended under the deal.
Trump said in July that he would be willing to meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani without any preconditions to discuss how to improve relations, which Rouhani dismissed.

The rare concession followed mounting international pressure, including from allies, to do more to limit civilian casualties in the 3-1/2 year civil war that has killed more than 10,000 people and pushed the country to the brink of famine.
Yemen's first round of peace talks in almost three years are expected to start in Geneva on Thursday, aimed at getting the Saudi-backed government and the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement to work toward halting the fighting, removing foreign forces, and establishing a unity government.
The protesters carried huge pictures of some of the children killed in the air strikes as they walked along a main road in the city. Other banners urged a boycott of U.S. products. 
Addressing the crowd, a Houthi official and called on the U.N. Security Council and the International Court of the Justice to ""prove their humanity"".
""We insist that all countries supporting this criminal coalition with weapons are directly involved in the bloodshed against children and women in our country,"" Abdel Salam al-Seliehy said. 
""(Those countries) will be haunted by the shame of this crime and will not escape a legal action,"" he added.
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the two Gulf states leading the coalition, receive Western political support and buy billions of dollars a year in arms from the United States and European powers including Britain and France.
The Pentagon believes that its assistance, which includes refueling coalition jets and training in targeting, helps reduce civilian casualties.
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters last week the United States recognized such mistakes as the bus attack were tragic. But he added: ""We haven't seen any callous disregard by the people we're working with.""
The coalition accuses the Houthi movement of importing weapons and ballistic missile from the Gulf countries' arch-rival Iran for more than three years. The Houthis and Iran deny the accusations of smuggling weapons.

The coalition has intercepted several missiles fired by the Houthis toward Saudi Arabia in recent weeks.

Trump, speaking to reporters during a visit with Kuwaiti ruler Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, said a possible assassination was ""never even discussed.""
""That was never even contemplated, nor would it be contemplated,"" Trump said, calling Woodward's book ""fiction.""
Trump wanted to have Assad assassinated last year but Defense Secretary James Mattis ignored the request, according to the book ""Fear: Trump in the White House."" Excerpts were published by the Washington Post on Tuesday.
Trump also said that if there is a slaughter in the Idlib province of Syria, the United States will be very angry. The Syrian military shelled Idlib, the last stronghold of active rebellion against al-Assad, on Wednesday as a war monitor said insurgents blew up a bridge in anticipation of a government offensive.

""That cannot be a slaughter,"" Trump said about Idlib. ""If it is a slaughter the world is going to get very, very angry and the United States is going to get very angry too.”

The legislation, introduced by Republican Senators Cory Gardner and Marco Rubio and Democrats Ed Markey and Bob Menendez, would authorize the State Department to downgrade U.S. relations with any government that shifts away from Taiwan, and to suspend or alter U.S. assistance.
It also requires a U.S. strategy to engage with governments to support Taiwan's diplomatic recognition or strengthen unofficial ties with Taiwan.
Gardner, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Asia subcommittee, discussed his plans for the legislation in an interview with Reuters last week. 
The State Department had said the United States was ""deeply disappointed"" by El Salvador's decision and was reviewing its relationship with San Salvador, without elaborating further. 

Washington does not recognize Taipei diplomatically but considers it a staunch ally in the Pacific Rim. Several members of Congress, who see Beijing as a threat to U.S. security and international influence, have expressed frustration with what they see as President Donald Trump's failure to adopt a strategy for Taiwan.

Duque has said the National Liberation Army (ELN) must free 19 hostages before he will resume dialogue. He said during his Aug. 7 inauguration he would evaluate the talks, which began with his predecessor Juan Manuel Santos’ government in February 2017, over his first 30 days.
The last round of the talks, which have been held in Cuba, ended on Aug. 1. The rebel group is believed to be holding six more members of the security forces in Choco province as well as 10 civilians.
""The soldiers Orlando Yair Vega Diaz, Juan Pablo Rojas Ovando and Eduardo Caro Banol, in the power of illegal group the ELN since August 8, 2018, were handed over to a humanitarian commission comprised of the ombudsman and the Episcopal Conference of Colombia,” the ombudsman said on Twitter.
The soldiers had been held in eastern Arauca province, near the border with Venezuela.
The ELN, founded by radical Catholic priests, is considered a terrorist group by the United States and European Union. It has waged a five-decade war against the government, engaging in bombings, kidnappings, extortion and sabotage of oil pipelines.

During a ceasefire from September 2017 to January 2018, the ELN suspended hostage-taking, attacks on oil installations, the use of landmines and the recruitment of minors.

BASRA, Iraq (Reuters) - Protesters set fire to the main government building in the southern Iraqi city of Basra on Wednesday, security sources said, amid growing unrest over poor basic services.
Demonstrators also blocked the road from the oil hub of Basra to Baghdad to express anger over electricity outages, unemployment and entrenched corruption in the long-neglected south, Iraq's Shi'ite heartland. 
Earlier on Wednesday, security forces sprayed tear gas and fired into the air to try to disperse demonstrators. 
The deaths of five protesters in clashes with security forces on Tuesday added to the fury.
Security and health sources said that 22 members of the security forces had been injured in Tuesday's violence, some by a hand grenade.
On Wednesday frustrations were once again focused on the provincial governorate building, where thousands of people gathered, throwing stones and trying to break down concrete barriers. 
Basra residents say salt seeping into the water supply has made it undrinkable and sent hundreds to hospital. This is proof, they say, that infrastructure has been allowed to collapse in the part of Iraq that produces most of its oil wealth.
Iraq's second biggest city, Basra is a stronghold of Moqtada al-Sadr, a Shi'ite cleric and former leader of an anti-American sectarian militia who has recast himself as an anti-corruption campaigner.
Public anger has grown at a time when politicians are struggling to form a new government after an inconclusive parliamentary election in May. 
Sadr's bloc came in first place in the vote, which was tainted by allegations of corruption which forced a recount.

Iraq's top Shi'ite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani has expressed support for the protests.

KAMPALA (Reuters) - A group of Ugandan legislators have petitioned the supreme court to overturn a lower court decision that upheld a constitutional amendment allowing long-serving leader Yoweri Museveni to seek re-election.
Parliament, which is controlled by the ruling party, voted overwhelmingly in December to scrap an age limit of 75 for presidential candidates. The original legislation would have effectively ruled out 73-year-old Museveni from standing in the next elections due in 2021.
Opponents of Museveni, including lawmakers and individual opposition activists, mounted a legal challenge to the amendment but the constitutional court rejected it in July.
Ladislaus Rwakafuzi, a lawyer for six lawmakers opposed to the amendment, told Reuters that the group had filed an appeal against that ruling on Tuesday. 
""We are dissatisfied with the verdict. We don't think they evaluated the evidence properly. Hopefully the supreme court will agree with our position,"" he said. ""You cannot amend the constitution without involving the people.""
As grounds for appeal, Rwakafuzi said lawmakers had been bribed before the vote and that insufficient public consultations had been held. He also alleged that soldiers ejected some MPs from the chamber during the debate.
The government rejected these accusations when they were used in the original legal challenge.
In power since 1986, Museveni has been accused by critics of using security forces to stifle opposition through intimidation. Political activists routinely allege arbitrary arrests and beatings. 
Last month, two lawmakers critical of Museveni, including popular musician-turned-politician Robert Kyagulanyim, said they were tortured by the military after the president's convoy was stoned in northwestern Uganda.
Kyagulanyim's supporters deny the allegations and say Museveni enjoys genuine mass support.
For their part, Ugandan authorities have rejected the accusations of torture by both men but said they would investigate them.

The move to amend the constitution last year drew widespread opposition and violent protests. Fistfights broke out in the legislative chamber on two occasions.

MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (Reuters) - Suspected Boko Haram militants have kidnapped between 10 and 20 people, a family member of one of those abducted, a senator and two military sources said on Wednesday.
The people were aboard a bus from Maiduguri, the city worst hit by Boko Haram, traveling to the town of Gwoza around 100 km(60 miles) away in the east of Borno state, near the border with Cameroon, late on Tuesday.
Boko Haram ""attacked commercial vehicles and abducted some civilians - over 10 men and women were abducted"", said one of the military sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. 
Other sources gave the number taken at around 20.
The abduction calls into question government and military statements that stability and security are returning to the northeast in the conflict with Islamist insurgents Boko Haram, which dates back to 2009.
President Muhammadu Buhari is now seeking a second term in February 2019 elections, campaigning in part on his administration's successes in the northeast.
A police spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. 
Isa Musa said his uncle was among those kidnapped.
""He was in the bus with some other passengers, men and women, about 20 of them, when the incident occurred,"" he said.
A second military source said Boko Haram stopped three vehicles on the road.
""One of the vehicles is a commercial passenger bus with about 20 passengers,"" they said. ""The terrorists fired shots and took away some of the passengers. Women were among (them) and one of our soldiers was killed in the attack.""
A senator from Borno sate, Ali Ndume, said that he had been contacted by the wife of one of the victims about the kidnapping of about 10 people. 
European states have warned the United Nations that more than 800,000 people are cut off from aid and may be starving in northeast Nigeria, in contrast to government assertions that the crisis has abated, and rebuked the world body for failing to secure access.

Kyl, 76, was sworn in as the new senator from the southwestern state of Arizona in a brief ceremony on the Senate floor. Vice President Mike Pence, who also serves as president of the Senate, administered the oath.
In replacing McCain, a maverick who at times went against his party, Kyl is expected to bring a somewhat more conservative political viewpoint to the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans. They hold 51 seats with 47 Democrats and two independents who align with Democrats - unchanged from when McCain held the seat.
McCain died on Aug. 25 after being diagnosed last year with brain cancer. He was buried on Sunday following tributes in both Arizona and Washington.
Senate Judiciary Committee hearings began on Tuesday to consider President Donald Trump's nomination of Kavanaugh to fill a vacant U.S. Supreme Court seat. Kyl, as a private citizen, had been helping usher Kavanaugh's nomination through the Senate.
A full Senate vote on Kavanaugh could come later this month. Kyl likely will give Republicans a little more of a cushion in what is expected to be a close vote, given Democratic opposition.
Kyl, who had been working as a lobbyist at the law firm Covington & Burling, had a previous stint as senator, rising to serve in Republican leadership before retiring in 2013.
""He has great judgment, an even keel, he's a team player, a true friend and an inspiring example of what a senator can and should be,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said of Kyl shortly before the swearing-in.
Kyl was appointed on Tuesday by Arizona Governor Doug Ducey, also a Republican, to temporarily fill McCain's seat.
In a news conference on Tuesday, Kyl said he would not be a candidate in a special election in 2020 to finish McCain's term that ends in January, 2023.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The federal judge overseeing the second trial of Paul Manafort, President Donald Trump's one-time campaign chairman, ruled on Wednesday that a federal investigation of possible collusion between the campaign and Russia cannot be discussed during the trial.
The collusion investigation being led by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is ""wholly irrelevant to the charges in this case,"" Judge Amy Berman Jackson said during a pre-trial hearing in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.
Manafort was convicted last month in Virginia of charges including bank and tax fraud in what was the first trial arising from Mueller's investigation of Russia's role in the 2016 U.S. election. Jackson said on Wednesday that while prosecutors may present evidence used in that trial, the jury will not be allowed to hear about Manafort's conviction.
She also said she plans to deny a request by Manafort's defense attorneys to move the trial to different court, saying that a concern about the political affiliations of the jury pool in Washington, D.C., is ""not a lawful basis"" for a venue transfer.
During the trial, which begins with jury selection on Sept. 17 and opening arguments Sept. 24, Manafort will face seven counts, including conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy to defraud the United States, failing to register as a foreign agent for the pro-Russia Ukrainian government, making false statements and witness tampering.
Manafort, a long-time Washington lobbyist who was with Trump's campaign from March through August in 2016, was convicted on Aug. 21 on eight counts in a federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, related to bank fraud, tax fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts.
The jury deadlocked on 10 other charges and prosecutors have not yet announced if they will seek to retry him.
The decision by Jackson to exclude testimony about the Russia collusion investigation is not a surprise. None of the charges are related to alleged collusion and Judge T.S. Ellis made a similar ruling ahead of the Virginia trial as part of an effort to keep politics out of it.
Discussion of Manafort's role in the Trump campaign will come up only in connection with alleged false statements he made about his foreign lobbying activities after critical media reports surfaced during the end of his stint as campaign chairman, prosecutors said Wednesday.
Prosecutors also indicated they do not yet know whether they plan to call as a witness Manafort's former business partner Rick Gates, who has pleaded guilty in the Muller probe. 
In the first trial Gates testified he helped Manafort doctor financial statements, hide foreign income and cheat on his taxes. The jury decided to disregard his testimony and focus on the documentary evidence, a juror said.

Manafort's lawyers revealed they are working to retain an expert witness who may testify at trial. They did not call witnesses in his first trial.

82,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2018 01:00PM ET</span>",Two opposition lawmakers elected in Rwanda for the first time,"KIGALI (Reuters) - Opposition candidates have won seats in the Rwandan parliament for the first time, election results showed on Wednesday, although the two new lawmakers will be heavily outnumbered by members of President Paul Kagame's ruling party.
Kagame's Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) declared the results of Monday's election proof that the country is a democracy, but one of the new opposition lawmakers said their tiny numbers meant pressing for democratization would be a long process.
Kagame is praised for restoring stability in Rwanda and for rapid economic progress after the 1994 genocide. But rights groups say he has muzzled independent media and suppressed opponents. The government dismisses the accusations as false. 
Officials of the electoral commission told a news conference on Wednesday that two candidates from the small opposition Democratic Green party had been elected.
However, the RPF - which has held a tight grip on the country since it fought its way to power to end the genocide - won 40 seats, together with smaller allied parties, the commission said.
Another small party, PS Imberakuri, also won two seats for the first time. However, it has generally been considered pro-government since its founder and ardent opposition figure Bernard Ntaganda was dismissed from the party.
Democratic Green chief Frank Habineza, one of the newly-elected lawmakers, set modest targets for the party.
""I think it is a positive step forward. They have allowed - I mean two new political parties have been able to enter parliament for the first time,"" he said.
""We will try our best even though we are still very few in the parliament,"" he told Reuters. ""This is one step forward, we are going to work towards more democratization of our country. It's not a one-day thing, it's a process.""
RPF spokesman Wellars Gasamagera said the two new parties would help broaden discussion in parliament. ""This means that Rwanda is a democracy. It means that the population has the right to choose whoever they want,"" he told Reuters.
Gasamagera, however, made clear not much would change. ""Rwandans adopted dialogue and consensus politics and the two new political parties agree with that policy and therefore we will keep to it,"" he said.
A number of the president's critics have fallen foul of the law.
Diane Rwigara, who wanted to compete against Kagame in the 2017 presidential election, is in jail, as is Victoire Ingabire, who returned from the Netherlands in 2010 to run for president.
Rwigara is due to reappear in court on Sept. 24, accused of using forged documents while she was trying to submit her candidacy and of inciting insurrection. She was barred from running and Kagame won with 98.8 percent of the vote last year.
Ingabire is serving a 15-year sentence on charges of trying to undermine the state and playing down the genocide.
Rwanda's parliament has 80 seats. Political parties compete for 53 seats and another 24 are reserved for women, two for youth and one for the disabled.

The company said the poor hygiene standards it had discovered in independent tests were the likely cause of a rise in illness amongst its guests at the hotel, but they did not shed any light on the still unexplained deaths of John Cooper and his wife Susan Cooper.
Local officials had said both deaths were from heart failure, although Egypt's public prosecutor said on Aug. 24 that the cause was still not yet clear.
""It is clear from these results that something went wrong in August at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel in Hurghada and that standards fell below what we expect from our hotel partners,"" Thomas Cook said on Wednesday.
But it said its independent specialists did not believe the tests gave any insight into the cause of the couple's deaths.
""We continue to await the results of the investigation being conducted by the Egyptian authorities and are working closely with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to ensure we prioritize the very best interests of the Cooper family,"" Thomas Cook chief executive Peter Fankhauser said. 

The company, which removed 300 customers from the hotel following the deaths, said it was putting together a compensation package for all of it customers who stayed at the hotel in August and had reported they were ill.

The prison court appearance could escalate a rivalry between Khaleda and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who have dominated politics in Bangladesh for more than two decades.
Khaleda's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) on Wednesday announced rallies across the country for Saturday to protest the government’s decision to set up the court inside the prison.
""You can punish me as long as you want. I know there is no justice,"" said Khaleda, 73, who was jailed in February and was brought to the court room in a wheelchair. The hearing was for a separate corruption case.
""I am extremely ill. My leg will swell if I sit for long. I can't come here again and again in this condition,"" she told the court.
Khaleda's lawyers said the decision to use the jail as a trial venue was ""unconstitutional and illegal"". The justice minister denied this. The next hearing starts on September 12.
Khaleda and the BNP say the charges are part of a plot to keep her and her family out of politics. She and Hasina are both related to former national leaders.
Hasina won the 2014 election for a second five-year term after Khaleda boycotted the polls in protest at the scrapping of the practice of installing a neutral caretaker government to oversee elections. 

The government of Hasina has been shaken by protests by tens of thousands of students in the past weeks.

KABUL (Reuters) - A suicide attack at a wrestling club in a Shi'ite neighborhood of the Afghan capital Kabul and a second explosion apparently targeting emergency services and journalists killed at least 20 people and wounded 70 on Wednesday, officials said.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack in Dasht-e-Barchi, home to many members of the mainly Shi'ite Muslim Hazara ethnic minority which has been targeted in the past by Sunni militants of Islamic State.
Last month, dozens of students preparing for a university entrance examination were killed at an educational center in the area.
Kabul police spokesman Hashmat Stanekzai said the second explosion hit as police were helping victims and a number of journalists were at the site.
Pictures showed young men in torn wrestling kit helping the wounded onto vehicles to be taken to hospital.
A reporter and a cameraman from Afghanistan's largest broadcaster, Tolo News, were killed in the second blast and four other local television crew were wounded, according to NAI, a group supporting open media in Afghanistan.
Last April, a suicide bomber apparently targeted journalists covering an attack in central Kabul, killing nine.
Wednesday's attack underlined the danger in Kabul as elections approach next month, as well as the threat facing the Hazaras, a Persian-speaking minority that has long faced discrimination and which has borne the brunt of attacks claimed by Islamic State in Kabul.
The explosion came as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that Washington's former ambassador to Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalizad, would be appointed as an adviser to help with efforts to end the conflict.
Hopes of possible peace talks with the Taliban were fueled by a brief ceasefire in June, although intense fighting in the months since has dampened optimism.
In any case, any talks would not include the local affiliate of Islamic State, which has established a brutal reputation and which both the Western-backed government and the Taliban consider an enemy.

First job: Chuck E. Cheese
I used to live right down the street from Chuck E. Cheese (a restaurant and arcade chain aimed at families) in Tempe, Arizona. On my first day they gave me a few options, like working the skee-ball area or giving out tickets, and I said: Not so much. Then they said, ‘Well, you could be Chuck E. Cheese,’ and I said yes. (Chuck E. Cheese is the chain's mouse mascot.)
There were a few drawbacks to that. One is that you are not allowed to say any words or make any sounds, which is difficult when you have little kids hanging off you all day long. There are some evil children in the world.
Also, many times they had me walk on the street corner in order to attract people in. Keep in mind this was in the Phoenix area, so it was 100 degrees, and I was inside a big furry costume. It was excellent heat training for my later adventures.
I used to use a whole can of Lysol before putting that costume head on. God knows how many years of sweat were collected in there. The final drawback was that the only break area was a little place under the stairs, and the other employee who used it was a 40-year-old clown. He didn’t say much, but he looked at me a lot. So I spent way too much time under the stairs with the creepy clown guy.

First job: Street advertising
The summer after I left school, I needed to earn enough money for a plane ticket to Africa, to escape from the claustrophobically boring countryside. I worked on minimum wage for Ye Olde Mill Shop in Skipton (Britain). I had to stand on the street wearing a sandwich board and holding a sign pointing toward the shop. Time dragged, my feet ached something chronic, and on one particularly hot day I almost fainted and had to be revived by the local greengrocer.
But I made it. I earned enough money for that plane ticket to Africa. And stepping out for the very first time into the bright sunshine, heat and smells of that new continent was made all the more thrilling for those hours, days and weeks in the sandwich board. A new life was about to begin.

The first job I ever had was straight after leaving school. I realized that if I wanted to explore the world, then step one was to save some funds. My ambition was to travel to northern India to climb and get to see the mighty Himalayas close up.

I figured that working for myself would be smarter, more fun and get me to the mountains faster. But the only skills I had were climbing and martial arts. I figured there could be a market teaching effective self-defense skills to busy professionals.
I dropped leaflets on 100 streets in the area of London that my sister lived in (where I could sleep on her sofa) and hired the local hall. Within a month I had saved enough for the airfare, and after three months I was good to go. My journey in life had begun.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel's government said on Wednesday it is preparing for all Brexit scenarios, including a no-deal, after its cabinet approved a draft law on a transition phase for Britain after it leaves the European Union next year.
A German government spokeswoman made clear that the draft law on a transition phase, the result of an EU agreement from March, would only come into force if an exit deal was reached.
""If we do not get to an agreement - a scenario we don't want - there will not be a transition phase,"" said spokeswoman Ulrike Demmer. ""To be equipped for all events, preparations for the case of a no-deal must also take place,"" she said.
Merkel said on Wednesday the EU needed to negotiate with Britain to ensure continued good relations.
Bloomberg reported earlier on Wednesday that the German and British governments had abandoned key Brexit demands, potentially easing the path for a divorce deal.
Asked to comment on the report, a government spokesman, who declined to be named, said Germany had full trust in the European Union's chief Brexit negotiator, who represents the bloc's 27 members in talks with Britain.
""The government's position is unchanged,"" the spokesman said. ""The federal government has full trust in the leadership of Michel Barnier.""
Germany has said individual EU member states should not negotiate separately with Britain as this would weaken the bloc's negotiating position. 
The issue of the Irish border has yet to be resolved and British Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party is deeply split on her negotiating strategy.
A German newspaper reported on Tuesday that Germany's preparations for Brexit included the hiring of new customs staff and that all possible outcomes were being considered.
Under the deal reached by Britain and the EU in March, Britain would effectively remain a non-voting EU member for 21 months until the end of 2020.
Demmer said the transition phase should give institutions and companies time to adjust to the reality of ending over four decades of integration with the world's largest trading bloc.
In mounting signs of concern in Berlin about progress of the talks, Merkel said late on Tuesday that Germany was doing all it could to ensure the EU and Britain reach a divorce deal, but warned that success was not guaranteed.
Earlier Merkel's CSU Bavarian allies said they wanted to have a close relationship with Britain after its departure.

""The United Kingdom remains a close economic partner and ally. We decisively reject a hard Brexit,"" the Christian Social Union (CSU) said in a draft document seen by Reuters that the party is due to agree on Thursday.

The office said they were suspected of passing Estonian and foreign classified information to the Russian Military Intelligence Service (GRU) for more than five years. 
It said in a statement the men had been detained on Monday and a court had issued an arrest warrant to keep both men in custody the following day. 
""We are talking about treason. We have grounds to suspect that state secrets were deliberately passed on to Russian Intelligence Service GRU,"" Prosecutor Inna Ombler said in the statement. 
Prime Minister Juri Ratas said in a separate statement the extent of the damage to Estonia had not yet been ascertained. 
""The detention of two Estonian citizens on the suspicion of treason is a deeply disturbing incident,"" he said. 
Estonia, a NATO and European Union member since 2004, was invaded by the Soviet Union in 1940 and became independent in 1991.

""I should not have said those words and I take them back,"" Stef Blok said during a debate over his remarks, made at a closed meeting with Dutch employees of international organizations in July.
""Give me an example of a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural society, where the indigenous population still live ... where they live in a peaceful, societal union,"" Blok said at the meeting. ""I don't know of any.""
The minister then went on to say people in general were probably ""genetically"" ill-equipped to relate to unfamiliar people, and linked political problems in Suriname to its ""ethnic composition.""
The former Dutch colony on South America's Atlantic northern coast, populated mainly by the descendants of Asian indentured workers, African slaves and indigenous people, was mentioned by someone in Blok's audience as an example of a peaceful multi-cultural society.
But the minister dismissed this, and said Suriname was a ""failed state"".
In his defense, Blok on Wednesday said he had only wanted to spark a debate during the meeting, and hadn't really meant what he said. 
When footage of the session was made public in July, the minister already said his choice of words had been ""unfortunate and careless"". But both opposition and coalition lawmakers demanded further explanations in parliament. 
""I don't know what's in our genes or not"", the minister said in the debate. ""But I do know that despite difficulties people are indeed perfectly able to live together.""

He also said he had tried to make amends with Suriname, but that his apologies had so far not been accepted by the country's government.

The Social Democrats, with its junior government partner the Greens and parliament ally the Left Party, are less than one percentage point ahead at 40.6 percent, the poll published by Svenska Dagbladet (SvD) showed.
The four-party centre-right Alliance was almost neck-and-neck with 39.8 percent, the SvD/SIFO poll based on 2,893 interviews carried out during Aug. 30 through Sept. 4 showed.
Neither bloc looks to have a real chance of securing a majority, with the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats, shunned by all other parties since entering parliament in 2010, polling at 17.1 percent.
Both Prime Minister Stefan Lofven's centre-left bloc and the opposition Alliance, for which Moderates leader Ulf Kristersson is the candidate for the premiership, have ruled out striking a deal with the Sweden Democrats after the election.
Still, forming a viable government without their support will need parties in the two blocs, which have defined Swedish politics for decades, to break ranks and offer at least tacit support for their rivals across the aisle.

The group has claimed responsibility for numerous attacks and kidnappings since it was formed in March 2017, the department said in a statement.
It said Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM) was responsible for an attack in June 2017 at a resort popular with Western expatriates outside Mali's capital, Bamako, as well as attacks on Malian troops, and coordinated attacks in Ouagadougou, the capital of neighboring Burkina Faso, in March this year.
""Al-Qaeda and its affiliates like JNIM remain deadly threats to the United States and our allies. These designations are part of our continuing efforts to squeeze al-Qaeda's finances, denying it the resources it needs to carry out attacks,"" said Nathan Sales, the department's coordinator for counterterrorism.
Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen, which was created from a merger of local groups, was later endorsed by Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. 
Islamist groups have claimed increasingly frequent attacks on Western targets in Mali and the wider West Africa region, including a raid on a Bamako hotel in late 2015 which killed 20 people.

Security Council to criticize Tehran, Washington's arch-foe.
U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said on Tuesday that Trump would chair a U.N. Security Council meeting on Iran this month to spotlight its ""violations of international law"" during the annual gathering of world leaders in New York.
""(Trump) plans to abuse presidency of SC (Security Council) to divert a session ... to blame Iran for horrors US & clients have unleashed across M.E. (Middle East) #chutzpah,"" Zarif wrote in his tweet.
The United States, which holds the council presidency for September, has unsuccessfully pushed the Security Council to call out Iran. Haley has regularly attacked Iran, accusing it of meddling in the wars in Syria and Yemen.
Haley told reporters Trump was chairing the meeting ""to address Iran’s violations of international law and the general instability Iran sows throughout the entire Middle East region.""
""There's only one UNSC resolution on Iran. .@realDonaldTrump is violating it & bullying others to do same,"" Zarif wrote, referring to a 2015 resolution linked to Iran's nuclear deal with world powers, from which Trump has withdrawn.
Trump in May withdrew from the accord aimed at stalling Tehran’s nuclear capabilities in return for lifting some sanctions, and ordered the reimposition of U.S. sanctions suspended under the deal.
Iran is still subject to a U.N. arms embargo and other restrictions contained in the resolution, which enshrines the nuclear deal. European powers have been scrambling to salvage the accord.

In February, Russia vetoed a U.S.-led bid for the Security Council to call out Tehran for failing to prevent its weapons from falling into the hands of Yemen’s Houthi group, a charge Tehran denies.

Special police forces, carrying helmets and shields, confronted the veterans of the 1990s Bosnian war who blocked the city center during a protest walk.
Some protesters said they were hit by rubber bullets and others beaten with batons.
Police said four officers were injured and two protesters detained before the crowd dispersed. Local media reported that dozens of veterans were sickened by the spray and given medical assistance.
The ex-soldiers in Bosnia's autonomous Bosniak-Croat Federation have repeatedly protested after the regional parliament failed to finalize adoption of a law granting them wider benefits, including higher pay-outs and free medical treatment.
The law was passed in July as a pre-election sweetener that defied warnings from the International Monetary Fund that it may jeopardize long-term fiscal stability.
The former fighters fear the law will not be adopted before Oct. 7, when Bosnia holds parliamentary and presidential elections.

Germany has been shaken by the most violent right-wing protests in decades after the fatal stabbing of a German man in the city of Chemnitz in the state of Saxony on Aug. 26, for which two immigrants were arrested. 
The Saxony government, in particular, has drawn accusations of ignoring the problem of far-right radicalism for years and conservative state premier Michael Kretschmer courted controversy on Wednesday by denying migrants had been hounded.
""There was no mob, there was no hunting down of people, there was no pogrom in this city,"" he told the state assembly.
Asked about the comments at a news conference with the Czech prime minister, Merkel disagreed with her fellow Christian Democratic Union member, saying: 
""We saw pictures that very clearly revealed hate and ... the persecution of innocent people. One must distance oneself from that. That is all there is to say.""
Merkel has drawn criticism for not visiting the scene of the protests, where skinheads hurled fireworks and bottles, chased migrants and made the illegal Nazi salute but her spokesman has said she will go to Chemnitz. No date is set.
With her open-doors migrant policy blamed for the rise of the far-right AfD party and movements like the anti-Muslim PEGIDA group, Merkel is keen to avoid major political fallout from the protests.
Next month her conservative allies in the state of Bavaria face a tough challenge from the AfD in a vote and after that comes a state election in Hesse. 
The far-right AfD, which has gained in polls since last week's protests and even overtaken the Social Democrats in one survey, lambasted Merkel and her spokesman for their reactions to the protests.
Senior AfD member Joerg Meuthen said Kretschmer had, belatedly, established the facts but Merkel and her spokesman had damaged the image of Saxony and Germany abroad with their assertions about mobs and chases.

Asked about this in a government news conference, a spokeswoman said: ""It remains the case that video recordings that we saw show how people with a foreign background were pursued and threatened"".

COX'S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - About 50 Rohingya Muslim refugees gathered in a muddy sports field in a camp in Bangladesh on Wednesday to protest against the conviction in Myanmar of two Reuters reporters, who were arrested while covering the plight of their community.
A Myanmar judge on Monday found the two journalists guilty of breaching a law on state secrets and jailed them for seven years, in a landmark case seen as a test of progress towards democracy in the Southeast Asian country.
The two reporters, Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, were investigating the killing by the Myanmar security forces of Rohingya villagers at the time of their arrest in December. 
The pair had pleaded not guilty.
More than 700,000 stateless Rohingya Muslims fled from the west of mostly Buddhist Myanmar into Bangladesh from August last year when Rohingya insurgent attacks on the Myanmar security forces triggered a sweeping military crackdown.
Abdu Shakur, the father of Rashid Ahmed, one of the 10 men whose deaths at the hands of the Myanmar military were exposed by the Reuters reporters, was among the crowd protesting in a refugee camp in southeast Bangladesh.
""I felt very upset as my sons and other families were innocent and the reporters were innocent,"" Shakur told Reuters.
""Why were they sentenced?""
The crowd held signs bearing the reporters faces and chanted ""Free!""
""I hope that if we all try for them then the government will release,"" Shakur said.
After the two reporters were arrested, the military confirmed that the massacre they were investigating, of 10 Rohingya in the village of Inn Din in Rakhine State, had taken place and several soldiers were prosecuted and punished.
Though the Myanmar military acknowledged the killings at Inn Din, the government has denied most allegations of atrocities against Rohingya by the security forces.
It says it conducted a legitimate counterinsurgency operation against Muslim militants who started the violence.
Rahama Khatun, the widow of another of the men killed in Inn Din, was also at the protest.
""Our family members have passed away, also these two Buddhists were jailed,"" she said, clutching a sign that read 'Release Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo'.
""Their families may be facing difficulties to survive. We have sympathy with their families.""

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary's ruling Fidesz party is strongly committed to the mainstream conservative group in the European Parliament for elections next year, a top official said, but will still pursue common causes with the likes of Italy's far-right League.
Right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orban agreed last week with League leader Matteo Salvini to press their anti-immigration agenda jointly for the European elections in May.
The two called French President Emmanuel Macron - who has said the election will be an open battle between anti-immigrant nationalists and pro-EU 'progressives' - their number one enemy.
However, Szabolcs Takacs, Hungary's state secretary in charge of European Union affairs, told Reuters that Fidesz would stick to the center-right European People's Party (EPP).
""We are a very strong and committed member of the EPP,"" he said in an interview. ""So we have no intentions whatsoever to distance ourselves from the traditional values of the EPP.""
Orban, who has crossed swords with the European Union in a series of disputes ranging from migration to the rule of law, also met U.S. President Donald Trump's former strategist Steve Bannon earlier this year.
""Why should we not talk to people who have similar ideas, approaches on certain issues? Just because we belong to one political family it does not mean that we cannot talk to other politicians,"" said Takacs. ""It does not automatically result in a new alliance."" 
Europe has seen a surge in support for far-right, anti-immigrant parties in recent national and regional elections, following a crisis that saw millions of people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa end up in Europe.
Apart from Fidesz, EPP member parties include the German Christian Democrats of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who declared an open door policy that allowed one million migrants into the country in 2015. By contrast, the League is allied to France's far-right National Front in The Nations and Freedom group.
Bannon has founded an anti-EU group to help nationalist, anti-immigration groups. Orban has said Bannon realized that there was room to spread conservative values in Europe.
UNDER ATTACK
Orban has rejected accepting any migrants under a quota system proposed by Brussels and was re-elected by a landslide in April after he built a fence in 2015 and kept out migrants.
His government passed a series of laws clamping down on non-governmental organizations that it sees as supporting migration with the help of Hungarian-born U.S. financier George Soros. 
Takacs said Hungary has been under attack for its firm stance on migration and an upcoming debate in the European Parliament about a report accusing Budapest of breaching EU law would be the next battle.
Next Wednesday, European lawmakers will vote on the report which says Hungary's curbs on the freedom of expression, its erosion of the independence of judiciary and treatment of asylum seekers among other policies represent ""a systemic threat to democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights"". 
""The whole report is a political tool, in a political campaign,"" Takacs said. ""The European institutions are trying to act as political activists ... We are calm because we know that in many issues we are right, and these accusations are just blatant lies in some respect.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain charged two Russians in absentia on Wednesday with the attempted murder of a former Russian spy and his daughter, saying the suspects were military intelligence officers almost certainly acting on orders from high up in the Russian state.
British police revealed images of the two men they said had flown to Britain for a weekend in March to kill former spy Sergei Skripal with Novichok, a military-grade nerve agent.
Skripal's daughter Yulia and a police officer who attended the scene also fell ill in the case, which has caused the biggest East-West diplomatic expulsions since the Cold War. A woman later died from Novichok poisoning after her partner found a counterfeit perfume bottle which police believe had been used to smuggle the nerve agent into Britain.
British authorities identified the suspects as Russian nationals traveling on genuine passports under the aliases Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov. Prime Minister Theresa May said the government had concluded they were officers in Russia's military intelligence service GRU.
""The GRU is a highly disciplined organization with a well-established chain of command, so this was not a rogue operation, May told parliament. ""It was almost certainly also approved outside the GRU at a senior level of the Russian state.""
Skripal, himself a former GRU officer who betrayed dozens of agents to Britain's MI6 foreign spy service, was found unconscious with Yulia on a public bench in the southern English city of Salisbury on March 4.
Police released security camera images of the two suspects and outlined a three-day mission that took them from Moscow to London to Salisbury, where they sprayed poison on Skripal's door before flying back to Moscow hours later. 
Russia's foreign ministry said the names given by Britain did not mean anything to Moscow, which has repeatedly denied any involvement in the attack. 
""We have heard or seen two names, these names mean nothing to me personally,"" Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters in Moscow. ""I don't understand why this was done and what sort of signal the British side is sending.""
Britain and dozens of other countries have kicked out scores of Russian diplomats over the incident, and Moscow has responded tit-for-tat with an identical number of expulsions. The affair has worsened Russian relations with the West, already under strain over Ukraine, Syria and other issues.
May's spokesman said May had briefed U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday evening. U.S. Ambassador to Britain Woody Johnson said on Twitter the United States stood with Britain in holding Russia accountable for its ""act of aggression"".
""REMARKABLY SOPHISTICATED ATTACK
The ""remarkably sophisticated"" attack appeared to be a clear assassination attempt, said Neil Basu, head of UK counter terrorism policing. He described an investigation which involved 250 detectives and analysis of some 11,000 hours of video.
According to police, the suspects, both around 40 years old, flew to London from Moscow on March 2. They spent two nights in an east London hotel, making two day trips to Salisbury, the first for reconnaissance, the second to kill Skripal. They flew out on March 4, hours after the Skripals were found unconscious.
Security cameras filmed the suspects near Skripal's house, and traces of Novichok were found in their London hotel room.
The Russians are charged with conspiracy to murder Sergei Skripal and with the attempted murder of Skripal, his daughter and police officer Nick Bailey. They are also charged with illegal use and possession of a chemical weapon. 
A European arrest warrant has been issued for them, but prosecutors said Britain would not ask Moscow to extradite Russian citizens because Russia's constitution forbids it.
Basu said the Skripals were making a good recovery.
A woman from a town near Salisbury, Dawn Sturgess, died in July and her partner Charlie Rowley fell ill after Rowley found a counterfeit bottle of Nina Ricci perfume containing Novichok in a charity collection box and brought it home. Basu said police had no doubt the events were linked, and were discussing charges over the Sturgess and Rowley case with prosecutors.
The Skripal case has been likened by British politicians to the murder of Russian dissident ex-spy Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned with a rare radioactive isotope in a London hotel in 2006. Britain charged two Russians with his murder but both remain in Russia, and one later won a seat in parliament.

May said the Litvinenko case showed there was no point to demanding the Skripal suspects' extradition. ""But should either of these individuals ever again travel outside Russia, we will take every possible step to detain them, to extradite them and to bring them to face justice here in the United Kingdom.""

The charges, which must be accepted by a judge before going to trial, are a blow to a campaign that has struggled to get off the ground.
However, the charges are unlikely to halt Alckmin's campaign. Under Brazilian law, a politician can only be barred from running if convicted of a crime that is upheld on appeal, which cannot possibly occur before next month's voting. 
According to Jota, a website specialized in judicial and regulatory affairs, prosecutors allege Alckmin took the campaign funds from Odebrecht SA [ODBES.UL], a scandal-plagued construction conglomerate, when he was running for governor of Sao Paulo state.
Representatives for Alckmin did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters, but have previously denied any wrongdoing. 
Prosecutors for the state of Sao Paulo, who are in charge of the investigation, declined to comment but said they would hold a press conference on the matter at 2 p.m. local time (1700 GMT).
The charges come a day after Fernando Haddad, the likely presidential candidate for Brazil's leftist Workers Party, was also charged with corruption by state prosecutors in Sao Paulo, charges he denied.
While neither of the politicians' campaigns are likely to be stopped, the accusations could hurt the candidates in a year in which Brazilians are increasingly fed up with endemic corruption that has been revealed during four years of intense political graft investigations.

RIYADH/GENEVA (Reuters) - Warring Yemenis due to attend the first peace talks since late 2015 on Thursday face an uphill struggle to rescue attempts to end a war marked by mass civilian casualties and fueled by rivalry between regional heavyweights Saudi Arabia and Iran.
U.N. Special Envoy Martin Griffiths wants Yemen's government and the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement to work towards a deal to end the war, remove foreign forces from Yemeni territory, and establish a national unity government.
A Saudi-led coalition of Sunni Muslim Arab states backed by Western powers, including the United States and Britain, intervened in Yemen's civil war in 2015 against the Houthis to restore the internationally recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. Subsequent peace talks flopped.
Since then the humanitarian situation has worsened dramatically, putting 8.4 million people on the brink of starvation, triggering the world's worst cholera epidemic, and wrecking the already weak economy. 
Nobody knows how many people have died: the U.N. lost count more than two years ago, after 10,000 civilians were killed.
Mohamed Ali al-Houthi, the head of the Houthi supreme revolutionary committee, wrote on Twitter on Tuesday that the negotiators at the U.N.-mediated discussions must take a resolute stand against the humanitarian impact of the war.
""I call on the delegation of the Yemeni people, if they are allowed to reach Geneva, to protest by refusing to begin the consultations until the nations commit to putting in place urgent economic solutions to confront the deterioration of the rial and rising prices due to the American-Saudi economic aggression against Yemen,"" he wrote.
In the capital Sanaa, Yemeni citizen Khaled al-Hosly told Reuters it was a ""failed dialogue"".
""This is a futile dialogue because the planes are over our heads, the prices are going up, the dollar is going up, the [Saudi] rial is going up, all the currencies are going up and the [Yemeni] people are starving.”
BIG BANG
Griffiths has already used the prospect of talks to forestall an attack by the Saudi-led coalition on Hodeidah, a port city and Yemen's main supply line. 
Aid workers say a full-blown assault on the port would be a catastrophe, and Griffiths has been in talks with the Houthis to hand control of the port to the U.N. to avert an assault. 
A draft U.N. peace plan seen by Reuters in June calls on the Houthis to give up their ballistic missiles in return for an end to the Saudi-led bombing campaign and a transitional governance agreement.
Peter Salisbury, senior consulting fellow at Chatham House, said the likely aim of the Geneva meeting was to get agreement on a framework peace plan, not side deals on the economy or Hodeidah. 
""The working theory right now seems to be that everything has to be sorted in one big bang, you can't sort of isolate issues and get deals on them one by one, you have to have this one packaged deal.”
Anwar Gargash, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates, part of the Saudi-led coalition, took to Twitter to welcome the peace talks and to urge all sides to engage constructively. 
""U.N. envoy Martin Griffiths deserves special praise,"" Gargash wrote. 

""His enthusiasm & drive made these talks possible. Coalition’s use of legitimate military force always intended to support political solution & (U.N. Security Council resolution) 2216. Long way to go. But Geneva can bring outcome nearer.""

Ushakov said Russian President Vladimir Putin and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe would talk about the disputed territory - known in Russia as the Kurile islands and in Japan as the Northern Territories -- when they meet in Russia next week. 
The islands dispute has meant that Tokyo and Moscow have yet to sign a peace treaty formally ending their World War Two hostilities.
""We proceed from the position that, in order to sign a peace treaty we need a corresponding atmosphere of trust and cooperation, and for that we need to further develop our bilateral contacts and partnership in various fields,"" Ushakov said at a briefing for reporters.
""We proceed from the position that, as you know, the Kurile islands were transferred to the Soviet Union and Russia at the end of World War Two on a lawful basis in line with international agreements.""

The Nassib crossing was closed in 2015 when captured by rebels, cutting a major transit route for hundreds of trucks a day transporting goods between Turkey and the Gulf, and between Lebanon and the Gulf. 
Those trade routes had already been disrupted by Syria's seven-year war, hurting regional economies. 
Lebanon's economy minister told Reuters in July the crossing was ""a vital artery"" for the Lebanese economy and a deal should be reached to re-open it. 
""Our study of the opening of the Nassib crossing found there is currently no big value for Syrian products and the issue needs further study,"" Syrian Economy Minister Samer Khalil said after meeting Lebanese Industry Minister Hussein Hajj Hassan in Damascus, NNA said.
Hassan said opening the crossing would help Lebanese exporters.
The crossing's recapture by Syrian forces in July was a central goal of a campaign launched last June by the Syrian government and Russian forces to regain control of rebel-held parts of the southwest.

BEACONSFIELD, England (Reuters) - Over wet grilled sausages and red wine on a rainy British weekend, an evening garden gathering of ageing Conservative Party members seems an unlikely setting for subversion.
But that is what is happening here and in dozens of other gardens and village halls across the country, a phenomenon that could tip the scales in a parliamentary vote on how Britain leaves the European Union. 
In the crowded kitchen in Beaconsfield -- an affluent commuter town outside London and Conservative stronghold -- there was angry talk about how Prime Minister Theresa May had sold short Leavers' dreams of making a clean break with the EU and reclaiming Britain's sovereignty.
""She has misled the country by giving the impression that we are leaving when we are not,"" Roger Kendrick, an investor in small businesses, told Reuters at the meeting, a fundraiser for the Campaign for Conservative Democracy.
""She is lying to the country and thinks she can get away with it,"" he said as he ate from a paper plate. ""We are being conned.""
Kendrick's opinion matters. The party's 124,000 rank-and-file members, mainly volunteers but also paid local councillors, play a meaningful role under the UK's political system, raising funds and rallying the local vote on election day.
If grassroots pressure can persuade just a handful of lawmakers to vote against May, they could kill the plan she is currently negotiating in Brussels.
With less than seven months to go until ""exit day"" on March 29, the future relationship between Britain's $2.6 trillion economy and the world's largest trading bloc is at stake.
The country remains divided on the issue - the result in the June 2016 referendum was 52 to 48 percent - and so is the Conservative Party, which called the vote.
Interviews in person and by phone with more than 25 party members across Britain show divisions between the grassroots in the counties and the leadership in London may go deeper than Brexit.
""We've been moving to this point for 20 years. Brexit is the issue that has brought it to a head,"" said John Strafford, the host of the Beaconsfield barbecue.
""You end up with the parliamentary party 60 to 70 percent in favor of 'Remain', and the voluntary party 60 to 70 percent to 'Leave' - and that clash is actually going to be the end of the Tory Party.""
    
CHEQUERS PLAN
May's ""business-friendly"" plan - named Chequers after the country house where it was agreed in July - prioritizes the smooth flow of goods and services with the EU over a clean break from Brussels' rules and regulations.
The EU says further concessions are necessary; hopes for an agreement in October have been pushed back to November. 
May has pledged that whatever emerges will go to parliament for approval, probably before Christmas.
If she loses that vote, she will face the possibility of Britain leaving the EU without a deal, a prospect that would likely spark a crisis of confidence and probably cost her the premiership. It could even force an early election.
Her working majority of 13 members in the 650-seat parliament - 316 Conservative lawmakers, plus a Northern Irish party with 10 and minus MPs who don't vote - only works if her lawmakers are united behind her. At the moment that's a big if, as shown most recently in July when 12 pro-EU lawmakers voted against her on a piece of Brexit-related legislation.
The grassroots plays a key role here by holding lawmakers' ""feet to the fire"", said Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London.
""So if they have committed to a hard Brexit it makes it difficult for them to renege on that commitment."" 
Some, like Chris Green, a Conservative MP from Bolton West, have already been turned.
Green resigned from a junior role in the transport department in July because of his opposition to the Chequers deal, and plans to vote against the proposal if it comes to parliament.
Lying just a few miles north west of Manchester, his constituency has traditionally been viewed as bellwether of national political trends and voted 56 percent for Brexit.
Green, who won his seat by just 936 votes at the last election in 2017, is concerned that his supporters will desert him to join the eurosceptic UK Independence Party (UKIP).
""The views on the proposed deal have been almost universally negative and there is an element on despair creeping in,"" he said. ""We have a clear instruction from the British people and any deviation from that will cause problems and divisions.""
A regular party meeting in August near the south coast city of Southampton to discuss health and social policy was swamped by members wanting to talk about Chequers and Brexit.
According to two of those present, the meeting, which usually attracts a dozen diehard members to feed policy ideas to the leadership, drew more than 50 people. Only two supported the Chequers plan versus leaving without a deal, according to minutes of the meeting.
Relaying the findings to party headquarters, the meeting's chair, Allan Glass, wrote in a letter seen by Reuters: ""Implicit in our observations is that the Chequers proposals are wholly misconceived and undesirable, and the government should drop them as soon as parliament reconvenes.""
Bob Perry, chairman of the Conservative association in Hornchurch and Upminster, east of London, said around 10 of his group's 160 to 170 members had resigned or declined to renew their membership since the Chequers agreement was unveiled.
""She (May) needs to listen to the grassroots because we are at the end of the day the foot soldiers, the people who pound the streets, knock the doors, deliver the leaflets, and if you can't get them behind you then you are going to have a problem.""
In Beaconsfield, Strafford has started a petition to stop the sitting MP, Dominic Grieve, from running as the party's candidate at the next election scheduled for 2022, mainly because Grieve led several pro-EU rebellions in parliament.
Grieve declined to comment on the petition.
Kendrick says he can't remember a time in the 30 years he has been a member of the Conservatives when there have been such deep divisions among members and such a disconnect between the leadership and rank and file.
BEYOND BREXIT
While polling shows the Conservatives neck and neck with the opposition Labour Party nationally, a Sky Data poll in August said that among the party's voters, 59 percent are unhappy with May's performance in Brexit negotiations. 
Potential successors to May are waiting in the wings, including former foreign minister Boris Johnson, who resigned days after the Chequers deal was announced and is actively campaigning against it.
For many at the grassroots, Johnson's leading role in the 2016 Brexit campaign and his mix of humor and common man's touch makes him an ideal replacement.
John Thorne, a local councillor in the southwestern county of Somerset who wants May to be removed, supports Johnson.
""People love Boris. He is the sort of guy you imagine sitting down in the pub and having a pint with,"" Thorne said. 
""I have confidence in him to deliver Brexit and he speaks the language of ordinary people.""
The overwhelming majority of party members interviewed saw little future for May even if she manages to scrape by as their leader beyond March. 
Britain's role in Europe helped sink the country's last three Conservative leaders: David Cameron, John Major and Margaret Thatcher. 
Now some wax nostalgic for Thatcher, including Glass, who attended the gathering in Beaconsfield.

""I just wish she could be a bit more like Maggie, and go over there and give them a good handbagging,"" Glass said, holding court under a dripping umbrella as Strafford's sausages smoked in the rain.

Far-right leaders have called for Merkel and her spokesman Steffen Seibert to apologize for exaggerating the anti-migrant violence after the state premier of Saxony, Michael Kretschmer on Wednesday said that ""no witchhunt"" had occurred in the protests.

Merkel, asked about the issue, told reporters: ""We saw pictures that very clearly revealed hate and thereby also the persecution of innocent people. One must distance oneself from that. That is what Mr. Seibert did, and I am doing, and have already done.""

BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian military shelled the last stronghold of active rebellion against President Bashar al-Assad on Wednesday as a war monitor said insurgents blew up another bridge in anticipation of a government offensive. 
Damascus, backed by allies Russia and Iran, has been preparing an assault to recover Idlib and adjacent areas of the northwest, and resumed air strikes along with Russia on Tuesday after weeks of lull.
Idlib's fate now appears likely to rest on the results of Friday's Tehran summit between the leaders of Russia, Turkey and Iran - a meeting that Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov on Wednesday said would make the situation ""clearer"".
Russia's Defence Ministry said Tuesday's air strikes had only targeted militants and not struck populated areas. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said they had killed 13 civilians, including children, but no fighters. 
The ministry said it had targeted buildings used to store weapons and explosives including a facility used to assemble explosive-packed drones that rebels have used to attack Russian planes stationed at Hmeymim air base. 
Syrian state media and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that pro-government forces focused their shelling overnight and on Wednesday on the western and southern edges of the rebel enclave. 
The countryside around Jisr al-Shughour in the west of the enclave was also the main target for Tuesday's air strikes, rescue workers, a rebel source and the British-based Observatory said. 
Turkey, which has a small military presence in observation posts it has erected along the frontlines between rebels and government forces, reiterated its warnings against an offensive.
Its president, Tayyip Erdogan, was quoted by a Turkish newspaper saying an attack on Idlib would be ""a serious massacre"" and he hoped for a positive outcome from a summit with Russian and Iranian leaders on the matter on Friday.

ALARM
The prospect of an offensive in Idlib has alarmed humanitarian agencies. The United Nations has said displaced people already make up about half of the 3 million people living in rebel-held areas of the northwest. 
The human rights group Amnesty International said in a statement on Wednesday that the lives of ""millions of people in Idlib are now in the hands of Russia, Turkey and Iran"", and urged all parties not to attack civilians. 
Idlib's rebel factions are divided, with a jihadist alliance that includes al Qaeda's former official Syrian affiliate holding most ground. The alliance, Tahrir al-Sham, is designated a terrorist organization by the United Nations. 
Russia has described Idlib as a ""nest of terrorists"" and a ""festering abscess"" that must be resolved. The United Nations Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura on Tuesday urged Russia and Turkey to find a solution and avert a bloodbath. 
Several other factions in Idlib, including some that fought under the banner of the Free Syrian Army, this year joined together into a new alliance backed by Turkey. 
This grouping, known as the National Liberation Front, also holds several important areas in and around Idlib. On Wednesday, one of the factions in it, the Islamist Ahrar al-Sham group, destroyed a bridge on the western side of the enclave, the Observatory said. 
Two other bridges were destroyed last week in anticipation of a government offensive, which a source close to Damascus has said is ready, and will be carried out in phases.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Meghan Markle was on Wednesday named the best dressed woman of 2018 by People magazine in a rare royal accolade by the celebrity publication.
Markle, 37, who became the Duchess of Sussex when she married Britain's Prince Harry in May, topped People's annual list ahead of Hollywood actresses including Cate Blanchett and Sandra Bullock, human rights lawyer Amal Clooney and reality star Kim Kardashian.
Giving top honors to a royal family member marked a departure for the magazine.
""We have never had the list with royals or anyone outside of Hollywood. But when you talk about style and 2018 you cannot have that conversation without mentioning Meghan Markle,"" People Style and Beauty editor Andrea Lavinthal told Reuters.
""Her style was the one that really had the spotlight this year so we felt we had to not only put her on the list but make her the best dressed,"" Lavinthal said.
California-born Markle, the former star of the TV show ""Suits,"" has rarely left the front pages of magazines and newspapers since her engagement to Harry in November 2017. Their May wedding was watched by millions around the world.
Yet Markle has won plaudits for mixing outfits from retail fashion stores with designer couture, while flouting traditional British royal protocol by showing her bare legs, wearing off the shoulder outfits and for wearing her hair in a messy bun for her wedding.
""Whether she is wearing a classic button down shirt and ripped jeans, like any other girl, or a couture wedding gown and a tiara, unlike most of us, she always looks effortlessly chic. There is something about her that looks polished without being too perfect,"" Lavinthal said.
People also praised Blanchett for consistently pulling off daring but flawless fashion designs, Clooney for a ""bold and glamorous style that's all her own,"" and ""Ocean's 8"" star Bullock who the magazine said ""has never looked more stunning.""
Kardashian, who mixes casual looks inspired by husband Kanye West's Yeezy fashion line with figure hugging glamour, was given a social influencer award by the Council of Fashion Designers of America in June.
""She looked great this year. She really sticks to her own aesthetic. She certainly does what she wants,"" Lavinthal said.

People's 23-page style issue arrives on U.S. newsstands on Friday.

New Delhi (Reuters) - There was ""zero intelligence"" of chemical weapons capabilities possessed by groups opposing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the province of Idlib, U.S. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said, adding that the facts did not back Russian assertions.
Syrian government forces plan a phased offensive in Idlib and surrounding areas held by rebels opposed to Assad, who has been backed by both Russian and Iranian forces in the country’s civil war.
Russian and Syrian jets hammered the rebel stronghold on Tuesday, days before the leaders of Russia, Iran and Turkey meet to discuss the expected Syrian government offensive that could spark a humanitarian disaster.
In the past few days, Russian officials, cited by Russian media, have said there was a plan by ""militants"" to stage a false chemical weapons attack in Idlib province to frame Assad. 
""We have zero intelligence that shows the opposition has any chemical capability,"" Mattis told reporters traveling with him to the Indian capital of New Delhi for a high-level dialogue on Thursday between the south Asian nation and the United States. 
Russia's Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov said he had told U.S. officials that Moscow was concerned over signs the United States was preparing new strikes on Syria and warned against ""groundless and illegal aggression against Syria.""
""We have made very clear that by putting out innuendo that somehow any chemical weapon use coming up in the future could be ascribed to the opposition, well, we want to see the data,"" Mattis said. ""We cannot see anything that indicates the opposition has that capability.""
He said instead there was a history of Assad's government using such weapons. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has twice ordered U.S.-led strikes against targets in Syria in response to what Washington called the Assad government's use of chemical weapons against civilians.
On Tuesday the White House said that if Assad used chemical weapons ""the United States and its allies would respond swiftly and appropriately.""
Asked if he saw indications of the Syrian government preparing to use chemical weapons in Idlib, Mattis said, "" I think the best answer to that is, we are very alert.""
Sputnik, a Russian state-owned news outlet, said recently the White Helmets rescue service had delivered a large shipment of toxic substances to ""local armed militant groups.""
The Pentagon said the Russian government was using a ""concentrated disinformation campaign"" to discredit the United States and its allies.

""That Russia is seeking to plant false lies about chemical weapons use suggests that Moscow is seeking to deflect from its own culpability when these heinous weapons are used,"" Commander Sean Robertson, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement.

Four months after parliamentary elections, Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri has not yet managed to form a national unity government, a delay that has raised fears for Lebanon's highly-indebted economy.
""Lebanon is in intensive care ... The economic situation is very serious,"" Berri said, according to MP Ali Bazzi, from Berri's Amal party. 
Hariri on Monday handed President Michel Aoun the ""formula"" for a new cabinet, but negotiations among lawmakers continue as key parties jostle over the allocation of ministries. 
Lebanon, which is used to lengthy cabinet negotiations, has the world's third highest debt-to-GDP ratio.

The blacklist will run to 154 people and 44 entities subject to an EU travel ban and asset freeze, once the leader of the Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine, Alexander Zakharchenko, who was killed in a cafeteria blast last week, is removed, diplomats said.
The list covers mostly Russian nationals and companies, as well as pro-Moscow Ukrainian entries. 
The formal extension of the sanctions until mid-March will be completed in the coming days, diplomats said. 
The bloc also has economic sanctions in place against Moscow for annexing Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and for backing rebels facing off against Kiev in the east of the country.
Given the delicate balance between Russia hawks in the EU's north and east, and those in the west and the south who would want to seek more business ties with Moscow, the bloc is likely to keep on extending the sanctions for now. 
But it is unlikely to step up significantly its sanctions regime despite a call by London for new punitive measures against Moscow over the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain earlier this year.
British prosecutors on Wednesday identified two Russians who they accused of trying to murder the ex-spy and his daughter in Salisbury, England.

Mladic, 75, was convicted of war crimes and genocide in November 2017 and sentenced to life in prison, notably for his role in the ethnic cleansing of Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats during the 1992-95 war in Bosnia.
The Mladic appeal is in its preliminary stages and no date has been set yet for public hearings. He was convicted of genocide for the 1995 massacre of nearly 8,000 Muslim men and boys after the fall of the Srebrenica enclave.
Among the judges to be replaced was Theodor Meron, the president of the legal mechanism in The Hague that took over appeals from the United Nations tribunal for the former Yugoslavia when it closed last year.
The judge accepted a defense argument that the appeals judges had ruled in other cases before the U.N. court dealing with facts Mladic is contesting and therefore might raise concerns about the court's impartiality.

Three new judges were assigned to the case, which is expected to be concluded in 2020.

The European elections are shaping up to be a major battle between centrist, pro-EU parties like Macron's Republique En Marche and more radical right-wing and far-right groups such as National Rally that want to shake up European politics after nearly a decade of financial and immigration crises.
The survey by the Ifop group for Paris Match and other French media showed Macron's party winning 20 percent of the French vote in the European elections, down from 23 percent in the last survey in June.
Support for the National Rally, formerly known as the National Front and led by Marine Le Pen, also declined but by less, to 17 percent from 19 percent, leaving the gap narrower.
The poll, conducted on Aug. 30-31, was taken after weeks of political difficulty for Macron following a scandal over his bodyguard, deteriorating economic news and the resignation of his popular environment minister, Nicolas Hulot.
It comes a day after a separate Ifop survey showed Macron's popularity had fallen by 10 percentage points to 31 percent, a new low for the president and below that of his predecessor Francois Hollande at the same point in his presidency. 
The largest gainer in Wednesday's poll was the far-left France Insoumise movement (France Unbowed) led by Jean-Luc Melenchon. It gained three percentage points to 14 percent. The Republicans, a right-wing party, held steady at 15 percent.
An analysis of national polls conducted by Reuters in July showed anti-EU or Eurosceptic parties on the right were likely to see a surge in support, potentially winning 15 to 20 percent of the 705 seats in the European assembly next May.

The European Parliament elections are important both as a bellwether of sentiment among the EU's 500 million people and because they can determine who leads the major EU institutions, including the European Commission, the bloc's civil service.

A new book by Watergate reporter Bob Woodward, ""Fear: Trump in the White House"", says Trump told his defense secretary that he wanted to have Assad assassinated in response to a chemical attack on Syrian civilians in April 2017.
The book said James Mattis, the defense secretary, told Trump he would ""get right on it"" but instead developed a plan for a limited air strike that did not threaten Assad personally. 
Trump tweeted that quotes attributed to Mattis were ""made up frauds, a con on the public"". Mattis dismissed the book as ""a uniquely Washington brand of literature"".
""I do not know of any such instruction. He (Trump) is also denying it, by the way,"" Israeli Intelligence Minister Yisrael Katz told Tel Aviv radio station 103 FM. 
""In any event, what can be said is that in the framework of the coordination between the United States and Israel ... the subject of the Syrian regime is certainly part of the discussions. Israel did not take a decision to topple Assad.""
While formally neutral on the 7-year civil war in neighboring Syria, Israel has carried out scores of air strikes against suspected attempts by Assad's Iranian and Lebanese Hezbollah allies to set up permanent posts or advanced arms.
Under decades of Assad family rule, Syria has maintained a Cold War-style hostility toward Israel. Katz said Israel did not see a better alternative to Assad among Syrian rebel groups.
""Of course his (Assad's) actions are terrible actions, and something that we abhor and condemn. Those opposing him, ISIS and others, are not a side that we think are better. We took care to preserve our interests,"" Katz said.
Woodward gained national fame for his reporting on the Watergate scandal in the 1970s, and has since written a number of books that provide behind-the-scenes glimpses of presidential administrations and other Washington institutions. 

For this book, Woodward spoke to top aides and other insiders with the understanding that he would not reveal how he got his information, said the Washington Post, which published excerpts from the book on Tuesday.

120,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2018 06:39AM ET</span>",Immigration and welfare fears merge as Sweden lurches to the right,"By Simon Johnson and Johan Sennero
KOPPARBERG, Sweden (Reuters) - Those wondering why Swedish politics are set to lurch to the right in Sunday's election need look no further than Ljusnarsberg, a tiny central county of dense pine forests and glistening lakes.
Many inhabitants of this once-booming region are uneasy about asylum seekers after a large number arrived here in 2015. Some also feel that Sweden's widely admired tax and welfare model has left them behind.
Fears over globalization's effect on industrial jobs, the pressure of an aging population and a failure to integrate minorities have boosted right-wing and anti-establishment parties from Italy and Germany to Britain and the United States.
Polls indicating one in five voters in Sweden are likely to back a party with roots in the far-right fringe on Sept. 9 show that even seemingly successful political systems are vulnerable.
Several online surveys indicate the anti-immigration, anti-European Union Sweden Democrats could become the largest party, overtaking the Social Democrats, who have dominated politics for the last 100 years.
They are likely to do particularly well in Ljusnarsberg where they won a quarter of the vote in 2014, double their national score.
(Sweden Election graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2LmSZFD)
(Swedish economy snapshot: http://tmsnrt.rs/2bylYpf) 
""I think people here want to see a change, they want society to be like it used to be,"" said Mats Larsson, the Sweden Democrat's top politician in Ljusnarsberg.
Most people in the county live in Kopparberg, where the 17th century church, with its blood-red, wooden facade and spires, hints at the region's rich past, built on copper and iron mines.
For many years, the area was a heartland of the ruling Social Democrats. Its swing to the right highlights election themes of asylum and a split between poor rural or suburban areas home to immigrants and wealthy places like Stockholm.
Ljusnarsberg's mines have gone - the last closed in the mid-1970s. Unemployment at the end of last year was nearly 13 percent, almost double the national level. Many live on sickness benefits, masking the figures of those relying on welfare. 
As jobs have disappeared, so have people. The population has roughly halved in the last 50 years and many services have been centralized to Orebro, an hour's drive south of Kopparberg.
""The 1970s and 1980s were a fantastic time to grow up here in this county. Now everything is falling to pieces,"" said Leif Danielsson, 53, a businessman in Kopparberg, the county's only sizable town.
""Houses are rotting, some places are overgrown with weeds. If you have any education or contacts, you leave."" 
While Kopparberg retained its health clinic, it has been unable to recruit permanent doctors, with temporary staff filling the gap. 
Decades of closures have left Kyrkbacks school in Kopparberg as the only school for 6-15 year-olds in the region. It has also had problems recruiting staff and was rated as one of Sweden's worst by the teachers' union, long before asylum numbers jumped.
STRETCHED SERVICES
When Sweden took in 163,000 asylum seekers in 2015 as hundreds of thousands fled war in Syria and Afghanistan, Ljusnarsberg was assigned around 1,200, the highest concentration compared with its population. 
Many of the new arrivals were unaccompanied minors, and the influx stretched services to the limit.
Anne-Marie Hagglund, assistant headteacher of Kyrkbacks school, said families just showed up with their migration papers. ""They came back day after day until we could take in their children,"" she said.
All but 260 of the refugees have now gone - mostly assigned to other areas by the Migration Agency - yet the unease remains.
Sitting in a cafe on the town green in Kopparberg, personal assistant Ulrika, 44, said that since the arrival of so many asylum seekers, women are afraid to walk the streets at night.
""There are lots of robberies. I think a lot of it is to do with immigration,"" she said, declining to give her surname.
Police say the number of reported crimes fell in 2017 compared to the previous year, though they admit that many crimes go unreported. After cutbacks, the nearest police station is in Lindesberg, 40 km away.
""Of course, we should help people,"" said Staffan Myrman, 53, who works at the Kopparberg brewery, one of the two major employers in the Ljusnarsberg region. 
""But when 25-30 percent of the population are refugees, we need to be able to cope with that and we can't.""
Sweden took in more asylum seekers than any other European country per capita in 2015. But while worries over immigration explain some of the Sweden Democrat's gains, unease about economic and social change also plays a role.
""It is a target to point your anger at,"" said Ljusnarsberg Liberal party politician Hendrik Bijloo. ""Of course there are racists voting for the Sweden Democrats, but they are not even close to a majority.""
REFERENDUM ON WELFARE?
It is not just rural areas like Ljusnarsberg where the Sweden Democrats have thrived.
A spate of gang killings and car-burnings have sharpened concerns that authorities are losing control in poorer city suburbs where immigrants make up the majority of the population.
But welfare is also a big theme, despite that fact that Sweden is one of Europe's richest countries, with strong growth and low unemployment.
""This election is a referendum on welfare or whether we have continued asylum immigration. I choose welfare,"" Sweden Democrat leader Jimmie Akesson said in a televised election debate.
The center-left government and main opposition Moderate Party both plan to spend an extra 20 billion Swedish crowns ($2.19 billion) over the next four years. 
Despite those plans, and already higher spending, many Swedes believe the welfare system is in crisis.
Sweden scores highly in the quality of healthcare - for example more Swedes are alive 30 days after a heart attack than in other European countries, according to a 2015 study. 
But a growing and ageing population means waiting lists for operations have grown and half of health centers have to cover doctor shortages with temporary staff, according to a report by the Swedish Agency for Health and Care Services Analysis.
Since 2000, 16 percent of maternity units have closed, a Swedish television report showed. Many women travel more than 100 km (62 miles) to give birth, while schools need to recruit around 77,000 teachers over the next five years.
Inequality, measured by the Gini coefficient, has grown faster in recent years in Sweden than in any other industrialized nation, although the country remains among those where income is most evenly distributed. 
This partly explains why mainstream parties' shift to tougher immigration policies after the 2015 crisis has failed to win back disillusioned voters.
Many locals in Ljusnarsberg are resentful about what they see as preferential treatment for immigrants.
""They get a better deal, all of them, at the dentist, with the doctor, they are first in the queue always,"" said 65-year-old pensioner Torbjorn Lundgren. ""That makes me angry.""
Asylum seekers get subsidized welfare, housing and 71 crowns ($7.79) a day for food and other essentials, including healthcare. Healthcare costs are capped at 400 crowns over a 12 month period. For Swedish citizens the cap is 1,100 crowns.
""It's not the immigrants fault, it's the politicians,"" said pensioner Torbjorn Lundgren, who backs the Sweden Democrats.

""I'm going to vote for them, then we'll see if things change or not.""

The militants drove up to a tuk-tuk vehicle carrying the soldiers in Mogadishu's Karan district and opened fire, killing all four of them on Tuesday, police said.
""We heard the gunfire and we rushed to the scene but ... the killers escaped,"" police captain Farah Aden told Reuters.
Al Shabaab fighters also shot two people dead in the Wardigley district in the heart of the city, he added. The militants said the two were an officer and his bodyguard, in a statement claiming responsibility for both attacks.
Abdiasis Abu Musab, al Shabaab's military operations spokesman, said the militants also set off a car bomb that seriously injured a man working for the finance ministry. There was no immediate comment from the authorities.
Al Shabaab - which is fighting to impose its form of Islam and topple the Western-backed government - has launched regular guerrilla attacks across the country since the army backed by African peacekeepers pushed it out of the capital in 2011.
On Monday, the group kidnapped more than 60 elders from Galgadud, in the central, semi-autonomous state of Galmudug, officials said.
Al Shabaab said it took the local leaders because their sub-clan had refused to pay full compensation for five people killed from another clan. ""We do not want the two clans to fight again,"" said Abdullahi Abu Khalid, named as al Shabaab's governor for Galgadud.
The militant group has kept up a presence in remote parts of Somalia, many of them already riven by years of ethnic rivalries and blood feuds. Some clans are seen as linked to the militants, others to the government.
Galmudug's president, Ahmed Duale Gele Haaf, said the militants had kidnapped 62 elders in a bid to destabilize his region. ""They will either kill them or order them to spread chaos,"" he said.
He accused the central government in Mogadishu of not giving enough resources or troops to protect the region.
Somalia has been gripped by violence and lawlessness since dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was toppled in 1991.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Thousands of farmers and laborers paralyzed the Indian capital on Wednesday in a protest against what they called the anti-people policies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, as opposition parties step up pressure ahead of key elections.
A sharp drop in commodity prices and stagnant wages have dented Modi's popularity in rural areas home to about two-thirds of India's 1.3 billion people, and key to his hopes of winning a second term in next year's general elections.
Traffic in many parts of central Delhi came to a halt as the protesters, many in red hats and waving red flags, marched towards Parliament Street in the heart of the capital. Some sat on pavements as honking vehicles moved slowly past.
""This country's farmers are very angry with the Modi government,"" said Karan Singh, a 58-year-old rice grower from India's northern breadbasket state of Haryana, dressed in traditional white clothes.
""We're suffering losses and the government is not doing anything about it.""
Modi's rural woes have been worsened by a failure to deliver on a promise of tens of millions of jobs for young people that helped him secure the largest mandate in three decades in 2014.
That vow has provided opposition parties their biggest stick to try and beat him with, in three big state elections this year ahead of next year's general election.
""This historic rally ... demanding better wages, more jobs, better prices for farm produce, end to privatization, stopping changes in labor laws, marks a new stage in the struggle of working people,"" the Communist Party of India (Marxist), which is leading the protest near parliament, said on Twitter.
Congress, the party that ruled India for most of its history and lost power to Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said it supported the ""fight back"" by farmers. It is banding with other opposition parties to take on the prime minister.
On social network Twitter, federal farm minister Radha Mohan Singh said the government was putting farmers first and working on initiatives such as easy credit to help meet Modi's target of doubling their income by 2022. 
In July, the government sharply hiked state-mandated prices for summer crops, including rice, that had been raised only by low single-digit figures during Modi's first four years in office.
In June, vegetable prices jumped 10 percent in major cities after a strike by millions of farmers to press demands such as loan waivers and higher prices for produce. 
Some of Wednesday's protesters were skeptical of the government effort.

Asked about Modi's plans to double farmers' income, Singh, the Haryana rice cultivator, responded, ""He can't, and won't, do it.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea said its envoys met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang on Wednesday to prepare for a third inter-Korean summit later this month, with hopes of putting momentum back into stalled talks between the North and the United States on denuclearization.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump reached a broad but unspecific agreement on denuclearization at a Singapore summit in June, but those talks have stalled since Trump canceled Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's trip to North Korea last month.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in's special envoys were led by the national security chief at the presidential Blue House, Chung Eui-yong, and the delegation included director of the National Intelligence Service, Suh Hoon.
The envoys held talks with Kim and delivered Moon's letter, and had dinner with unspecified North Korean officials, according to Blue House spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom.
""The envoys would return after the dinner,"" the spokesman said in a statement, adding further details will be announced on Thursday. 
The 11-member delegation was greeted in Pyongyang by Ri Son Gwon, chairman of a North Korean committee in charge of cross-border affairs, who has steered high-level inter-Korean talks, according to Moon's press secretary Yoon Young-chan.
They held a 20-minute meeting with Ri and Kim Yong Chol, who played a key role with Pompeo in arranging the Singapore summit, Yoon said without elaborating. 
The United States and North Korea are at odds over whether denuclearization or a step towards the normalization of bilateral relations by declaring the end of the 1950-53 Korean War should come first. 
The war was ended by an armistice, not a peace treaty, meaning U.S.-led United Nations forces, including South Korea, are technically still at war with the North.
Chung said on Tuesday he wanted to discuss with Pyongyang officials ways to achieve the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. 
Seoul would also continue to push for a joint declaration with the United States of an end to the Korean war this year, Chung said. 
The North's Kim made his first public appearance in 16 days to pay respects at the funeral of Ju Kyu Chang, North Korean state media KCNA reported on Wednesday. 
Ju was a leading contributor to North Korea's successful development of its nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles and space program, according to the Stimson Centre's 38 North, a website that specializes in analysis of North Korea. 
The United States wants North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons without condition. 
North Korea has said in previous, failed talks years ago that it could consider giving up its nuclear arsenal if the United States provided security guarantees by removing its troops from South Korea and withdrew its so-called nuclear umbrella of deterrence from South Korea and Japan.

North Korea is preparing to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the regime's founding on Sunday.

The 11 were arrested and weapons, ammunition and a large amount of explosives were seized during an operation by Afghan special forces, the NDS said in a statement. It did not say when the arrests were made.
""The group was mainly involved in bomb blasts and targeted the killing of government employees and tribal elders in Kabul,"" the statement said.
The Taliban said on Tuesday that Jalaluddin Haqqani, who founded the Haqqani network in the 1970s, had died after a long illness. Haqqani's son, Sirajuddin, is in operational control of the network and it was not clear what practical impact his death may have on its activities.
Jalaluddin Haqqani achieved prominence as a guerrilla leader in the U.S.-backed campaign against Soviet forces occupying Afghanistan during the 1980s but later allied himself with the Taliban, fighting American troops after the Taliban were ousted in 2001.
The Haqqani network is known for bloody attacks against government institutions and Afghan and foreign forces in Afghanistan as well as other targets.

The funds are held at the Hamburg-based Europaeisch-Iranische Handelsbank (eihbank). The bank was not immediately available for comment.
The U.S. ambassador to Germany had been urging Berlin to stop Iran withdrawing large sums of cash from bank accounts in Germany to offset the effect of new U.S. sanctions imposed after Washington withdrew from a 2015 nuclear deal.
""Iran is the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. We must be vigilant,"" Ambassador Richard Grenell said on Twitter on Wednesday in reaction to news that Iran was dropping its bid to move the money. 
The development was earlier reported by the German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung and the broadcasters NDR and WDR. 
Washington has announced new sanctions on Iran and ordered all countries to stop buying Iranian oil by November and foreign firms to stop doing business there or face U.S. blacklists.
Iran argues it needs the cash for Iranian citizens traveling abroad since they cannot access recognized credit cards.

128,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2018 05:10AM ET</span>",U.N. inquiry says Burundi still committing crimes against humanity,"GENEVA (Reuters) - More crimes against humanity were committed in Burundi in 2017 and 2018, whipped up by rhetoric from top officials including President Pierre Nkurunziza, a U.N. human rights report said on Wednesday.
Burundi has tried and failed to stop the U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Burundi, set up by the U.N. Human Rights Council in 2016, and refuses to cooperate with it. The commission said last year that officials at the highest level were responsible for crimes against humanity. 
""The Commission has reasonable grounds to believe that crimes against humanity continue to be committed in Burundi,"" the Commission's latest report said. 
""These crimes include murder, imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty, torture, rape and other forms of sexual violence of comparable gravity, and persecution on political grounds.""
Nkurunziza's spokesman and Burundi’s human rights minister declined to make an immediate comment. 
Burundi has been seized by violence since early 2015 when Nkurunziza said he would seek a third term, widely seen as a breach of the constitution. 
Clashes between security forces and rebels left hundreds dead and forced about half a million to flee -- rattling a region still haunted by the memories of the 1994 genocide in neighboring Rwanda, which has a similar ethnic mix to Burundi.
In May this year a referendum changed the constitution in a way that could allow him to remain president until 2034. 
""This climate of disregard for human rights continues to be fomented by repeated instances in which hatred and violence have been advocated by the authorities, including the Head of State and members of (the ruling party) CNDD-FDD,"" the commission said.
The Commission said Nkurunziza's policies, pouring resources into security at the expense of social services, increasing debt and the burden on women looking after families, had turned Burundi from a developing country to a humanitarian emergency. 
""In the space of two years, the number of people 'in need', mainly in terms of health care, food, water, hygiene and sanitation, increased from 1 million to 3.6 million, representing more than 34 per cent of the population.""
Corruption and ""misappropriation of public funds among high-level authorities"" were further depleting state resources, it said. 
Members of the National Intelligence Service and the police, including high-ranking officials, committed a large number of human rights violations, and the Imbonerakure, the youth wing of the ruling party, was playing a growing role, the report said.
Opponents of the government had been detained and tortured, often by the Imbonerakure, the commission said. 
The number of summary executions appeared to have diminished since 2015, when they took place on a large scale, but the perpetrators took care to cover their tracks by weighing down the bodies and throwing them into rivers, it said.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's top court cleared the way on Wednesday for the demolition of a Bedouin village in the occupied West Bank whose fate has become a focus of Palestinian protests and international concern.
The Supreme Court, in a decision released by a court spokesman, rejected petitions against the demolition of Khan al-Ahmar and said a temporary injunction that had put a hold on the move would lapse in a week.
Around 180 Bedouin, raising sheep and goats, live in tin and wood shacks in Khan al-Ahmar. It is outside Jerusalem between two Israeli settlements and was built without Israeli permits, which Palestinians say are impossible to obtain.
Israel said it plans to relocate the residents to an area about 12 km (seven miles) away, near the Palestinian village of Abu Dis.
But the new site is next to a landfill, and rights advocates say that a forcible transfer of the residents would violate international law applying to occupied territory.
The European Union had publicly urged Israel to cancel the evacuation plan.
Feisal Abu Dahouk, a resident of Khan Al-Ahmar called the court's ruling ""a racist decision"", telling Reuters by telephone ""there is no place we can go"".
Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman hailed the decision.
""Khan al-Ammar will be evacuated! I congratulate the Supreme Court justices on their brave and called-for decision, in the face of the orchestrated hypocrisy of Abu Mazen (Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas), the left and European states,"" Lieberman wrote on Twitter.
Ayman Odeh, head of the United Arab List in Israel's parliament, said on Twitter the villagers had ""fallen victim to the destructive policies of a rightist government that is broadening settlement blocs at the cost of Arab communities"".
Most countries consider settlements built by Israel on land it captured in the 1967 Middle East War as illegal, and an obstacle to peace. They say they reduce and fragment the territory Palestinians seek for a viable state in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.

Israel disputes this and cites biblical, historical and political connections to the land, as well as security needs.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo landed in Pakistan on Wednesday for a brief visit on his whistle-stop tour of the region, with the war in Afghanistan and the issue of Islamist militants once again set to dominate discussions with Pakistan.
Pompeo is next due to visit India, the main stop of his South Asia tour, where he is expected to pile pressure on New Delhi over its purchases of Iranian oil and Russian missile systems in talks with senior Indian officials.
In Pakistan, Pompeo will meet new premier Imran Khan and the army chief, Qamar Javed Bajwa, against a backdrop of tense ties and U.S. military aid cuts over Islamabad's alleged reluctance to crack down on militants. 
Relations between uneasy allies United States and Pakistan have frayed in recent years, with Washington accusing Islamabad of turning a blind eye or helping Afghan Taliban and Haqqani network militants who stage attacks in Afghanistan. Pakistan denies doing so.
A Reuters reporter saw Pompeo's plane land at Islamabad airport just before 1 p.m. (0800 GMT).
Pakistan's new foreign minister, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, said he would ""have exchanges"" with Pompeo over Washington's cancellation of a $300-million disbursement for the Pakistani military.
Taking a tougher line with an ally that U.S. President Donald Trump considers unreliable, the United States halted the disbursement of Coalition Support Funds due to Islamabad's perceived failure to take decisive action against Afghan Taliban militants operating from Pakistani soil.
The United States has withheld $800 million this year, cuts Pakistan says are unwarranted as it incurs expenses in fighting militants who pose a danger to U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Pompeo is also expected to discuss Pakistan's possible plans to seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to ease currency pressures and avert an economic crisis. 
In July, Pompeo said there was ""no rationale"" for the IMF to give money to Pakistan that would then be used to pay off Chinese loans, comments that further rattled Islamabad.
Pompeo and U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will meet their Indian counterparts in New Delhi on Thursday, and are expected to finalize defense pacts that could bring their militaries closer amid China's rising influence.
The talks come as U.S. hostility rises towards India's traditional allies Iran and Russia, on which Washington has placed sanctions. Iran is a big oil supplier to India, and two-thirds of its military equipment is from Russia.
""They're part of the conversation, they're part of the relationship, they will certainly come up, but I don't think they will be the primary focus of what it is we're trying to accomplish here,"" Pompeo told U.S. pool reporters en route to Pakistan.

Damascus, backed by allies Russia and Iran, has been preparing an assault to recover Idlib and adjacent areas of the northwest, and resumed heavy air strikes on Tuesday after weeks of lull.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that pro-government forces focused their shelling overnight and early on Wednesday on the area around Jisr al-Shughour in the west of the rebel enclave. 
The countryside around there was also the main target for Tuesday's air strikes, rescue workers, a rebel source and the British-based Observatory said. 
Turkey, which has a small military presence in observation posts it has erected along the frontlines between rebels and government forces, reiterated its warnings against an offensive.
Its president, Tayyip Erdogan, was quoted by a Turkish newspaper saying an attack on Idlib would be ""a serious massacre"" and he hoped for a positive outcome from a summit with Russian and Iranian leaders on the matter on Friday.
(Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2NHAqh3)
The prospect of an offensive in Idlib has alarmed humanitarian agencies. The United Nations has said displaced people already make up about half of the 3 million people living in rebel-held areas of the northwest. 
Idlib's rebel factions are divided, with a jihadist alliance that includes al Qaeda's former official Syrian affiliate holding most ground. The alliance, Tahrir al-Sham, is designated a terrorist organization by the United Nations. 
Russia has described Idlib as a ""nest of terrorists"" and a ""festering abscess"" that must be resolved. The United Nations Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura on Tuesday urged Russia and Turkey to find a solution and avert a bloodbath. 
Several other factions in Idlib, including some that fought under the banner of the Free Syrian Army, this year joined together into a new alliance backed by Turkey. 
This grouping, known as the National Liberation Front, also holds several important areas in and around Idlib. On Wednesday, one of the factions in it, the Islamist Ahrar al-Sham group, destroyed a bridge on the western side of the enclave, the Observatory said. 

Two other bridges were destroyed last week in anticipation of a government offensive, which a source close to Damascus has said is ready, and will be carried out in phases.

A 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck in March 2011, triggering a tsunami that killed some 18,000 people and the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl 25 years earlier.
The Health, Labour and Welfare Ministry ruled on Friday that compensation should be paid to the family of the man in his 50s who died from lung cancer, an official told Reuters by phone.
The worker had spent his career working at nuclear plants around Japan and worked at the Fukushima Daiichi plant operated by Tokyo Electric Power at least twice after the March 2011 meltdowns at the station.
He was diagnosed with cancer in February 2016, the official said.
The ministry had previously ruled exposure to radiation caused the illnesses of four workers at Fukushima, the official said. This was the first death, he said.
More than 160,000 people were forced from their homes after the meltdowns at the plant.
Hundreds of deaths have been attributed to the chaos of evacuations during the crisis and because of the hardship and mental trauma refugees have experienced since then, but the government had said that radiation was not a cause.
Tokyo Electric is facing a string of legal cases seeking compensation over the disaster.

In the June 23, 2016 referendum, 17.4 million voters, or 51.9 percent of the votes cast, backed leaving the EU while 16.1 million voters, or 48.1 percent of votes cast, backed staying. Many opinion polls were wrong about the result.
Polling showed 59 percent of voters would now vote to remain in the bloc, versus 41 percent who would vote to leave. The findings were published in an academic-led report on Wednesday by research bodies NatCen and The UK in a Changing Europe.
That is the highest recorded support for 'remain' in a series of five such surveys since the 2016 referendum and a large reversal of the actual 52-48 percent vote to leave.
The author of the report, polling expert John Curtice, added a note of caution, saying that their panel of interviewees reported they had voted 53 percent in favor of remain in the original vote - a higher proportion than the actual vote.
""Nevertheless, this still means that there has apparently been a six-point swing from Leave to Remain, larger than that registered by any of our previous rounds of interviewing, and a figure that would seemingly point to a 54 percent (Remain) vote in any second referendum held now,"" Curtice said in the report.
Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29, 2019 but has yet to secure an exit agreement to define future relations with Brussels and manage the economic impact of ending over four decades of integration with the world's largest trading bloc.
The government has ruled out holding a second referendum.
The survey interviewed 2,048 subjects between June 7 and July 8. That means the survey does not fully reflect any change in opinion brought about by the publication of Prime Minister Theresa May's negotiating strategy, published in early July. 
That negotiating strategy has split May's party at every level and drawn heavy criticism from both Brexit supporters and those who want to retain close ties to the EU. 
Nevertheless, the poll shows voters thought the negotiations were going badly even before the publication of May's so-called Chequers plan.
""Both Remain and Leave supporters have become markedly more critical of how both the UK government - especially - and the EU - somewhat less so - have been handling the negotiations,"" Curtice said. ""They have also become markedly more pessimistic about how good a deal Britain will get.""

Curtice said the results of the polling showed that the most influential factor over whether voters will support the conclusion of the negotiations is their perception of its economic effect rather than the details of any deal.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia's parliament on Wednesday held its first session since a July general election in which Prime Minister Hun Sen's ruling party claimed victory but which critics called a sham because of the lack of a viable opposition.
The United Nations and Western countries have described the election as flawed after the Supreme Court last year dissolved the main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) over accusations of plotting to topple the government.    
King Norodom Sihamoni presided over the opening session of parliament after Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party (CPP) won all 125 parliamentary seats up for grabs in the July 29 vote.
""All members of parliament, who represent the whole nation, will expend more vigorous efforts helping people to enjoy equal access to religious belief, education, decent jobs,"" the king said in his opening speech. 
Also attending the session were representatives from China, Malaysia, Timor-Leste and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). 
Absent were Australia, the European Union and the United States whose relationship with Cambodia has cooled considerably since Hun Sen and his allies launched a campaign aimed at silencing critics in the election run-up.
""Given Australia's views on the flawed election process, Australia will not be represented at the inauguration of Cambodia's National Assembly,"" Rebecca Chirichiello, spokeswoman of its department of foreign affairs and trade, told Reuters.
Ambassador George Edgar said he was in Brussels and so unable to attend.
It was ""significant and alarming that democratically elected governments chose to be absent at the opening of the National Assembly,"" said Mu Sochua, deputy president of the CNRP.

Its leader Kem Sokha, jailed on treason charges last September, remains in pre-trial detention.

139,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2018 02:20AM ET</span>","Inspired by #MeToo, student activists target inequality in China","By Sue-Lin Wong and Christian Shepherd
HUIZHOU, China (Reuters) - At 1 am on April 23, Yue Xin was rudely awakened in her dormitory at China's prestigious Peking University by her mother and a faculty adviser.
Yue, emboldened by the global #MeToo movement, had gained prominence across China for demanding that her university release information about a decades-old rape and suicide case. She should stop her activities, her mother and adviser said, as they shook her awake.
Shortly after the incident, she posted an open letter online about what had happened.
""When I saw my mother bawling, slapping her face, kneeling and begging and even threatening suicide, my heart broke,"" she wrote.
""But as a matter of principle, I could not retreat.""
Last month Yue took a leading role in another cause, joining dozens of student activists from across China who had come to the southern city of Huizhou to support factory workers trying to form a labor union.
""At university, my friends and I used to talk about how we lacked motivation, how we felt lost and trapped,"" Yue told Reuters on August 23.
""But I don't feel that when I'm here, when I'm engaged with society and fighting for things I believe in,"" said Yue, who has shoulder-length black hair she often ties into pigtails.
In two-dozen interviews, Yue and other young activists in southern China spoke about the self-interest and materialism they saw among students in China's elite universities.
The activists said they'd rather act to address growing inequality in China, as well as other social concerns.
They have been facing off with the Chinese government in recent months over issues like sexual assault on campuses, workers' rights, and the right to host reading groups to discuss social issues.
Unlike the student leaders of the 1989 pro-democracy Tiananmen protests, the activists said they weren't calling for an overhaul of China's political system. 
Instead, they take their inspiration from the intellectuals of the May Fourth movement, the 1919 protests that called for China to strengthen itself and were instrumental in forming the Chinese Communist Party.
Today's activists are calling for greater equality in Chinese society, as well as better treatment for minority groups, migrant workers and lower income groups.
While apparently small in number, the activists are likely viewed as a challenge by the ruling Communist Party, which is wary of activism with national scope and aware of the role students and intellectuals have played in social movements throughout China's history, including in its own revolution.
In the interviews, the activists cited Marxist and Leninist ideals, as well as quotes from Mao Zedong and President Xi Jinping, as they spoke about their desire to address China's inequalities.
While acknowledging the challenges of Chinese censorship, they have also become adept at getting their message out online and on social media.
They use code words to evade government scrutiny. They communicate on messaging apps using end-to-end encryption. On the heavily-censored messaging platform WeChat, they send images of articles, rotated and distorted with shapes and squiggles that can trip up text recognition functions.
When online censors tried to scrub a letter Yue posted on WeChat in April about being pressured by her university, fellow students used blockchain technology to ensure it remained accessible. 
Peking University and China's Public Security Bureau did not respond to requests for comment. 
While some students on China's elite university campuses expressed sympathy for Yue and other activists, others told Reuters they saw them as ""radicals"" or said they had not heard of their activities.
The activists say the government has responded to their activities by, among other things, putting them under surveillance, pressuring their families and detaining many activists.
At dawn on August 24, police raided an apartment in Huizhou where Yue and about 50 activists were staying, taking everyone away. The activists had traveled to Huizhou to support workers at a factory owned by Jasic, a welding equipment company. Supporters of the activists in Beijing and other parts of the country were also detained. 
That evening, China's official Xinhua news agency released the first state media coverage of the protests, condemning the factory workers and alleging they had been supported by organizations backed by foreign governments. The story did not mention the raid in Huizhou.
The article made one reference to the students, saying they had been ""swept up"" by the ""persistent agitation"" of overseas websites.
Some students have been escorted back to their hometowns by their parents and the police, where they are under varying degrees of surveillance, according to interviews with some of the activists. Others remain missing.
For some activists, the Huizhou detentions are not the first time they have stared down Chinese authorities.
In December, eight activists were detained for ""creating a disturbance"" after organizing a reading group in the southern city of Guangzhou that delved into social issues and Marxist theory.
Shortly afterwards, the group launched an online publication called Pioneer Magazine, with posts about student activism, factory workers, Marxism and social inequality. Articles are shared via github, a coding platform that remains unblocked in China. 
Three of those detained in December, Xu Zhongliang, Zheng Yongming and Gu Jiayue, were also detained in the Huizhou raids, and are still missing.
SOCIAL CAUSES
Reuters spoke with the activists before they were detained, in the four-bedroom apartment they had rented on the outskirts of Huizhou. 
They had rosters to share duties for preparing meals and cleaning, as well as shooting and editing videos, outreach and social media.
Several students talked about the diverse range of social issues they were engaged in through on-campus clubs - from fighting against sexual harassment to improving the lives of migrant workers in megacities like Beijing.
Around 50 students - including around 20 from Peking University - and other activists originally came to Huizhou after some Jasic workers were detained by the authorities. 
Their numbers more than doubled after a leading activist, Shen Mengyu, was taken away in a car by three unidentified men on August 11.
""Something that is really drilled into us at university is this concept of having 'sentiments for the family and country',"" said Feng Ge, 23, a Peking University student. ""It can't just be an empty slogan. Here we have an opportunity to act.""
Support for the factory workers has poured in from around the country, the students said, adding that many friends and classmates had sent donations over WeChat.
Yue and Zheng said new supporters had been calling each day, saying they wanted to join the activists but were too afraid.
Yue, who had been in regular contact with Reuters about the worker protests, has not responded to repeated phone calls and text messages since the raid.
Before she disappeared, Yue wrote an open letter to Xi, saying that young people of all backgrounds should live among the working class - an example Xi set himself when he lived in a rural Chinese village.
""We are not a foreign power, nor a student revolution, nor do we make other political demands,"" Yue said in the letter published online on August 19.
""We just want to ensure there is justice for the Jasic factory workers.""
Despite the pressure from the authorities, the activists appear undeterred.
""Can it really be that the students of elite universities should only eat, drink and be merry,"" Zhang Shengye, a Peking University graduate, wrote in an open letter released on Sunday and signed by more than 60 supporters of the factory workers.
""Should we avoid discussing affairs of the nation and just be blindly subservient?""

Zhang was detained on Sunday night, labor activists told Reuters.

China has detected eight cases of the highly contagious virus since discovering the first outbreak on Aug. 3, raising concerns about its spread in the world's largest pork producer and beyond its borders into Southeast Asia.
Its arrival in China marked a new front in the battle to control the disease, which has traveled from Europe over the past decade through Russia. 
(Outbreaks of African swine fever in China by location: https://reut.rs/2PCNswR)
First detected in Africa almost a century ago, the virus is often deadly for pigs but does not harm humans. 
Specialists from China and nine countries close by and considered to be at risk from a spread of the disease are attending the meeting running from Wednesday to Friday in Bangkok, along with experts from outside the region and participants from the private commercial swine sector.
The nine countries are Cambodia, Japan, Laos, Mongolia, Myanmar, the Philippines, South Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam, the UN's Food & Agriculture Organization (FAO) said in a statement on Wednesday.
The FAO has repeatedly warned that the arrival of the disease poses a significant threat to Asia.
""It's critical that this region be ready for the very real possibility that (swine fever) could jump the border into other countries,"" said Wantanee Kalpravidh, regional manager of the FAO Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases (ECTAD) in Asia.
""That's why this emergency meeting has been convened - to assess where we are now - and to determine how we can work together in a coordinated, regional response to this serious situation.""
Chinese authorities are rushing to contain the virus, shutting live markets in infected provinces and banning transportation of live pigs and pork products in and out of those regions. 
Highlighting the challenge though, South Korea had to ramp up quarantine measures at airports after finding a traveler carrying Chinese food infected with the disease.
The seminar will review recent research studies and technologies and consider lessons from recent and ongoing episodes in Europe, it said.
The disease is transmitted by ticks and direct contact between animals, and can also travel via contaminated food, animal feed, and people traveling from one place to another. There is no vaccine.

141,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2018 02:10AM ET</span>",Corrupt government? You voted for them - China pushes back at Africa summit,"By Ben Blanchard
BEIJING (Reuters) - As President Xi Jinping gathered together leaders from almost all African countries for a summit in Beijing in recent days, some former Chinese officials and state media were busy mounting an unusually strong defense of China's role in the continent.
China has long bristled at accusations, mostly from Western nations, that it is solely interested in Africa's raw materials, and that its no-strings-attached approach to loans and aid has only encouraged graft and brought unsustainably high debt.
At the few news conferences during the summit, African reporters peppered Chinese officials with questions about corruption, environmental problems and concerns about a lack of Africans employed in some of China's projects.
Cheng Tao, a former head of the Chinese Foreign Ministry's Africa division and previously China's ambassador in Mali and Morocco, said it was unfair to blame China for supporting governments accused of corruption.
""An African friend told me, our government is extremely corrupt. How come you're still involved with them? Our government has asked the Chinese government to build a bridge and a hospital, but the Chinese government shouldn't help them,"" he said, without naming the country.
""I told him - you voted for this government. It's the only government we can deal with. But the bridge and the hospital are not built for the president or officials, but are for the common people. So I think this is another perspective that can be considered when looking at this issue.""
Of the 10 bottom-ranked countries in last year's corruption perceptions index by Transparency International, four of them sent their presidents to the summit - Equatorial Guinea, Somalia, Sudan and South Sudan.
Since Xi took office six years ago, he has mounted war against deeply-ingrained graft in his own country, and the government has been keen to show it is not encouraging similar problems overseas where China in involved.
Liu Guijin, China's former special envoy to Africa, said China did not want its money frittered away through corruption.
""China's engagement in Africa is focused on its people and we do not give our money to corrupt governments or officials,"" said Liu, who was previously deeply involved in efforts to end Sudan's civil war and still advises China's government.
Indeed, a declaration adopted after the summit, released on Wednesday, said China and Africa would continue to take a ""zero tolerance"" approach to corruption.
DEBT WOES
Another area of rising concern has been the amount of debt African countries now owe China. Xi offered Africa another $60 billion on Monday.
Speaking in Ethiopia in March, then-U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said African countries should be careful not to forfeit their sovereignty when they accept loans from China and carefully consider the terms of those agreements.
A senior Chinese official denied before the summit opened that his country was engaging in ""debt trap"" diplomacy, and on Tuesday China's special envoy to the continent said China is helping Africa develop, not pile up debt.
The overseas edition of the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily wrote in a commentary on Saturday that certain people it did not name never tired of trying to attack China-Africa cooperation under the guise of concern about debt or neo-colonialism.
It cited what it said was an African expression that there was ""nothing scary about a loan"".
""The crux is what you do with it. Do you go buy oxen and sheep to expand production, or buy booze for a moment of fun?"" the paper said.
African countries say China generally offers better terms, and is more willing to provide money than the United States or Europe.
Liban Soleman, general coordinator of the Bureau of Coordination and Planning for an Emerging Gabon, told Reuters on the summit's sidelines the idea that China is saddling African countries with debt they can't repay is ""unfair"".
""I think that what the Chinese system has offered Africa is something that is ... probably the most flexible, specifically with the system between the grace periods and the very low interest rates,"" he said.
""I think that the main element that people misunderstand is the competitiveness of the infrastructure prices that the Chinese companies are giving to African countries.""
China has acknowledged there are some problems it is working to fix. Xi told a business summit on Monday that Chinese funds are not for ""vanity projects"" and Chinese firms must respect local people and the environment in Africa.
By the end of this year, China would have provided technical training for more than 200,000 Africans, Chinese Commerce Minister Zhong Shan told a China-Africa forum on Sunday according to a Commerce Ministry statement.
Jiang Zengwei, Chairman of the government-run China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, said as Africans became increasingly technologically able, there would be less need for Chinese workers to be flown in.
""This is what we must do or we cannot foster a long-term cooperative relationship,"" he told reporters.

142,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2018 01:50AM ET</span>","Typhoon kills 10 in Japan, boats move stranded passengers from airport","TOKYO (Reuters) - A powerful typhoon killed 10 people in western Japan and an airport company started to transfer some 3,000 stranded passengers by boats from a flooded airport, the government said on Wednesday, as more than a million homes were without power.
Jebi, or ""swallow"" in Korean, was briefly a super typhoon and is the most powerful storm to hit Japan in 25 years. It follows heavy rains, landslides, floods and record-breaking heat that killed hundreds of people this summer.
(Japan Typhoon: https://tmsnrt.rs/2N6Eudz)
About 3,000 tourists stayed overnight at Kansai Airport in western Japan, an important hub for Japanese companies to export semiconductors. Television footage showing people lining up to buy food and drinks at a convenience store in the airport. 
Airport officials began transferring the stranded passengers to nearby Kobe airport by high-speed boats and buses on Wednesday morning, the government said.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said about 300 people were injured. It was uncertain when the airport would reopen and some roads and train lines in the affected areas were still closed, he said. About 1.2 million homes were without power.
""The government will continue to do everything possible to tackle these issues with utmost urgency,"" Suga told a news conference.
Japan's JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy Corp (T:5020) shut at least one of the refining units at its 135,000 barrels-per-day Sakai refinery in Osaka in western Japan due to typhoon damage to part of the cooling tower, the trade ministry said. [nL3N1VR00U]
Many chip plants operate in the Kansai region. Toshiba Memory, the world's second-largest maker of flash memory chips, was monitoring developments closely and may need to ship products from other airports if Kansai remains closed, a spokeswoman said. 
She said the company was not expecting a major impact because its plant in Yokkaichi in central Japan had not been affected by the typhoon.
It could take several days to a week to reopen Kansai airport depending on the damage, the Yomiuri newspaper quoted an unidentified person in the airline industry as saying.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, criticized for an initially slow response to devastating floods in July, posted repeated updates on the rescue efforts at Kansai.

Jebi's course brought it close to parts of western Japan hit by rains and flooding that killed more than 200 people in July but most of the damage this time appeared to be from the wind.

Nauru is hosting leaders of 18 Pacific nations, plusdelegations from non-member countries including the United States and China, at a time of growing tension and rivalry in a strategically important region with access to swathes of resource-rich ocean.
""The Chinese demanded to be heard when (Tuvalu's) prime minister was about to speak,"" Nauru President Baron Waqa said at a news conference late on Tuesday, after media reported a heated start to the leaders' closed-door meeting.
""He insisted and was very insolent about it, and created a big fuss and held up the meeting of leaders for a good number of minutes when he was only an official. So maybe because he was from a big country he wanted to bully us,"" Waqa said.
Nauru and Tuvalu are two of six Pacific countries to have diplomatic ties with Taiwan, another major source of tension with China, which regards Taiwan as a wayward province, to be taken back by force if necessary.
China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China's delegation was led by Du Qiwen, its ambassador to Fiji. 
Waqa said protocol dictated speaking priority was given to ministers over diplomats.
China has become one of the dominant economic players in the Pacific, spending billions of dollars in trade, investment, aid and tourism in a region that staunch U.S. ally Australia has long regarded as its ""back yard"".
Chinese lending to the region has surged from nearly zero to $1.3 billion over the last decade, stoking concern that tiny nations could end up overburdened and in debt.
It is also the second-largest bilateral donor in the region, behind Australia. Nauru has no diplomatic relations with China.
New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters attended the leaders' meeting, and had told reporters on Tuesday there was no walk-out by China's delegation, contrary to some reports.
The dispute echoes an incident in 2017 when Chinese delegates were reported to have disrupted the opening remarks at a conference in Australia about conflict diamonds, because a Taiwan delegation was invited.
Separately, Nauru on Wednesday also reinstated the press credentials of a New Zealand journalist who had been briefly held by police for failing to seek permission to meet a refugee sent to Nauru under Australia's hardline immigration policy.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday called on Myanmar's government to reverse a court ruling that imprisoned two Reuters journalists for seven years and to release them immediately.
The journalists were found guilty on Monday on official secrets charges in a landmark case seen as a test of progress toward democracy in Myanmar, which was ruled by a military junta until 2011.
Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, were investigating the killing by security forces of Rohingya villagers at the time of their arrest last December, and had pleaded not guilty.
""Wa Lone & Kyaw Soe Oo shd be commended—not imprisoned—for their work exposing human rights violations & mass killings. Freedom of religion & freedom of the press are essential to a strong democracy,"" Pence wrote on Twitter.
Pence is the most senior U.S. official to add his voice to an international outcry against the verdict by a Myanmar judge, who said the two had breached the colonial-era Official Secrets Act when they collected and obtained confidential documents.
In Yangon earlier on Tuesday, the wives of two journalists insisted that the men were innocent and called for them to be reunited with their families.
""Deeply troubled by the Burmese court ruling sentencing 2 @Reuters journalists to 7 years in jail for doing their job reporting on the atrocities being committed on the Rohingya people,"" Pence wrote in another tweet.
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Tuesday that the United States would become more vocal about the two journalists' situation. 
Speaking at a news conference in New York marking the U.S. assumption of the rotating chairmanship of the Security Council for September, Haley said the reporters were ""in prison for telling the truth.""
Mark Green, administrator for the U.S. Agency for International Development, said ""these convictions are an enormous setback for democracy and the rule of law in Burma.""
MOUNTING PRESSURE
The verdict came amid mounting pressure on the government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi over a security crackdown sparked by attacks by Rohingya Muslim insurgents on security forces in Rakhine State in west Myanmar in August 2017.
More than 700,000 stateless Rohingya Muslims have fled into Bangladesh since then, according to U.N. agencies. The Rohingya, who regard themselves as native to Rakhine, are widely considered as interlopers by the country's Buddhist majority and are denied citizenship.Neither Suu Kyi nor her government have commented publicly on the case since the reporters were convicted. 
The journalists were arrested on Dec. 12 while investigating the killing of 10 Rohingya men and boys and other abuses involving soldiers and police in the village of Inn Din.
Myanmar has denied allegations of atrocities against Rohingya by its security forces, saying it conducted a legitimate counterinsurgency operation against Muslim militants.
The military acknowledged the killing of the 10 Rohingya at Inn Din after arresting the Reuters reporters.
A U.N mandated fact-finding mission said last week that Myanmar's military carried out mass killings and gang rapes of Muslim Rohingya with ""genocidal intent"" and called for top generals to be prosecuted. Myanmar rejected the findings.

The International Criminal Court is considering whether it has jurisdiction over events in Rakhine, while the United States, the European Union and Canada have sanctioned Myanmar military and police officers over the crackdown.

147,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2018 07:00PM ET</span>",Guatemala bars entry to head of U.N. anti-corruption body,"GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Guatemala's government said on Tuesday it had barred the head of a U.N. anti-corruption body from entering the country, days after the agency's mandate was revoked during an escalation of a long-running dispute between the two sides.
In a statement, the government said President Jimmy Morales had ordered Ivan Velasquez, head of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), to be denied entry and asked the United Nations to send a replacement.
On Friday, Morales said the commission's mandate would end next September, attacking the body which brought down his predecessor as president with a corruption probe. 
In a separate graft case, the CICIG and Guatemala's attorney general last year attempted to prosecute Morales on suspicion he had engaged in illegal financing during his 2015 presidential election campaign. He denied any wrongdoing.
By then, tensions were already running high between Morales and Velasquez because the commission had previously launched graft probes against members of the president's family.
In a statement, the government said Morales had barred Velasquez on the recommendation of the National Security Council, which accused the CICIG's head of attacking Guatemala's governability, public order and justice.
""At the same time, a request has been made to the U.N. Secretary General for a substitute for Mr. Ivan Velasquez to be designated,"" the statement said.
CICIG spokesman Matias Ponce said Velasquez was still in the United States and had not yet been notified of the ban.
A spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights told a Tuesday press briefing in Geneva that Guatemala's decision not to renew the CICIG's mandate could be a significant setback in efforts to root out criminal networks in the country.
The Guatemalan attorney general's office and the CICIG in August again sought to bring Morales to trial for suspected illicit campaign financing. That process is ongoing. Last year, Congress voted not to impeach the president on such charges.
Morales' credibility has suffered due to the CICIG's investigations, and he has moved to align himself more closely with the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.

In December, Guatemala was one of a handful of countries to back Trump's decision to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem in a vote at the United Nations.

QUITO (Reuters) - A group of Latin American nations called on Tuesday for increased aid to assist thousands of Venezuelan immigrants fleeing the economic collapse of their homeland.
A group of 11 nations signed a declaration in the Ecuadorean capital of Quito urging ""substantially increased"" resources to grapple with the exodus of Venezuelans, which a U.N. agency recently described as reaching a ""crisis moment.""
The declaration, signed by officials from Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Costa Rica, Colombia, Chile, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay, followed a two-day meeting of technical teams focused on the issue.
It urged increased spending on assistance for Venezuelan migrants by the countries themselves, as well as support from the United Nations and other ""specialized international organizations."" 
Ecuador's Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the declaration. But Ecuador's Deputy Minister of Human Mobility, Santiago Chavez, said aid from regional multilateral organizations was also being sought.
Delegations were still working to determine exactly how much aid they would request, Chavez said, adding that the figure would depend on the number of Venezuelans arriving in each country.
The statement also urged the government of President Nicolas Maduro to ensure that citizens have identification cards and travel documents in order to cross borders freely.
Venezuela did not participate in the Ecuador meeting despite being invited, organizers said.
Since 2015, more than 1.6 million Venezuelans have abandoned their country, with 90 percent arriving in neighboring South American countries, according to the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR.
Maduro and other top officials of Venezuela's ruling Socialist Party have dismissed those migration figures as stemming from politically motivated alarmism and ""fake news"" meant to justify foreign intervention in the country's affairs. 

Maduro said on Monday night that no more than 600,000 Venezuelans had emigrated in the last two years.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - German conservative Manfred Weber will announce his candidacy on Wednesday to front the center-right in European elections next May, a source familiar with the plans told Reuters.
The Bavarian leads the center-right European People's Party caucus, a grouping of conservative parties in the European Parliament. If other member parties give him their backing, Weber would be among the frontrunners to succeed Jean-Claude Juncker as European Commission president a year from now.
The EPP, the biggest group in the European Parliament and whose parliamentary group Weber will address in Brussels on Wednesday morning, will choose its lead candidate at a convention in Helsinki in November. Michel Barnier, the French former foreign minister who is now running the EU's Brexit talks with Britain, and former Finnish prime minister Alexander Stubb are also possible contenders but have yet to declare themselves.
Other parties are not expected to name their top candidates until later in the year or early in 2019.
Juncker’s successor must be agreed by leaders of European Union member states following the European elections in May that will see anti-EU parties bidding to increase their minority in the legislature. The parliament, which must approve the leaders' nominee, will push them to choose a Commission president from among the lead candidates of the main parties - despite many leaders insisting they should be free to nominate anyone.
At 46, Weber is relatively young and has held none of the high ministerial offices or national leadership roles typical of past heads of the EU executive. However, parliamentary leaders argue that naming a Commission president from among those elected to the European Parliament would help rebut arguments that the European Union is bureaucratic and authoritarian.

Weber has secured the backing of his own party, the Bavarian Christian Social Union, which is closely allied to German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats, the CDU. His declarations in public tend to confirm reports that Merkel has given Weber her personal endorsement ahead of a CDU meeting on the issue of the EPP candidate next week.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will chair a U.N. Security Council meeting on Iran this month to spotlight its ""violations of international law"" during the annual gathering of world leaders in New York, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said on Tuesday.
The United States, which holds the council presidency for September, has unsuccessfully pushed the Security Council to call out Iran. Haley has regularly attacked Iran, accusing it of meddling in the wars in Syria and Yemen.
Haley told reporters Trump was chairing the meeting ""to address Iran's violations of international law and the general instability Iran sows throughout the entire Middle East region.""
Diplomats said Iran could request to speak at the Sept. 26 meeting, the high-level week of the U.N. General Assembly. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani is expected to address the assembly on Sept. 25. The Iranian U.N. mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Haley said the United States would not object to Rouhani speaking. 
Russia's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy said the Iran meeting should focus on the implementation of a 2015 resolution on Iran.
""We very much hope that there will be views voiced in connection with the U.S. withdrawal"" from a 2015 international nuclear deal, Polyanskiy told the council. 
Trump in May withdrew from the accord between Iran and six world powers aimed at stalling Tehran's nuclear capabilities in return for lifting some sanctions. Trump ordered the reimposition of U.S. sanctions suspended under the deal.
Iran is still subject to a U.N. arms embargo and other restrictions contained in the resolution, which enshrines the nuclear deal. European powers have been scrambling to salvage the accord.
In February, Russia vetoed a U.S.-led bid for the Security Council to call out Tehran for failing to prevent its weapons from falling into the hands of Yemen's Houthi group, a charge Tehran denies.
Several council members on Tuesday also expressed opposition to Haley's plan to convene a meeting on Wednesday on Nicaragua. 
More than 300 people have been killed and thousands injured in crackdowns by police and armed groups on protests over government plans to cut welfare benefits. The protests developed into broader opposition against President Daniel Ortega.

China, Russia, Bolivia and others said the situation in Nicaragua was not a threat to international peace and security and therefore should not be discussed by the council. Bolivia is expected to try to block the meeting on Wednesday but does not have the minimum nine votes required to do so, diplomats said.

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (Reuters) - Five members of a New Mexico compound facing federal firearms and conspiracy charges will seek bail again, a defense lawyer said on Tuesday, just days after two state judges and prosecutors dismissed child abuse charges against the defendants on procedural grounds.
The five Muslim defendants made their first appearance in U.S. District Court of New Mexico in Albuquerque on Tuesday, four days after the FBI charged them with violating weapons and conspiracy laws.
This comes weeks after a state judge received death threats for granting bail to the group accused of child abuse and planning ""jihad"". In August, police raided their makeshift settlement and found 11 children without food or clean water and a cache of weapons. Three days later police found the body of a toddler.
U.S. Magistrate Judge Kirtan Khalsa on Tuesday said she would seek additional information from probation officers ahead of making a bail decision in the controversial case. She was due to make a ruling on bail on Wednesday.
""It could go either way, it depends a lot on a person's background,"" federal defense attorney Kari Converse, who is representing three of the defendants, said of the bail decision. 
Federal prosecutor George Kraehe, speaking at the hearing on Tuesday, said the U.S. government would seek their detention without bail.
The FBI arrested the five in Taos, about 95 miles (153 km) north of Albuquerque, after three of them had state child abuse charges dismissed and were released from jail due to a procedural error by prosecutors.
The FBI charged Jany Leveille, a 35-year-old female Haitian national, with being in the United States illegally and unlawfully in possession of firearms. Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, 40; Hujrah Wahhaj, 37; Subhanah Wahhaj, 35; and Lucas Morton, 40, were charged with aiding and conspiring with her.
In an affidavit, the FBI said a teenage boy among the group, taken into custody at the compound, told agents Ibn Wahhaj was ""trying to put an army together"" to conduct ""jihad"" against non-believers, according to federal court documents.
The boy told the FBI he watched his mother, Leveille, and her partner Ibn Wahhaj perform a faith healing ritual over the three-year old boy during which the child choked and his heart stopped, according to the special agent's affidavit.
Defense lawyers have said the five adults were exercising their rights to practice their religion and own firearms, and they are being discriminated against for being black and Muslim.

State prosecutors on Friday dismissed charges against Leveille and Ibn Wahhaj for the death of the toddler. Taos County District Attorney Donald Gallegos said in a statement that he planned to refile the charges, as well as child abuse charges against the three other defendants to a grand jury on Sept. 27.

BEIRUT/ANKARA (Reuters) - Russian and Syrian jets hammered a major rebel stronghold on Tuesday, a war monitor said, days before leaders of Russia, Iran and Turkey meet to discuss an expected Syrian government offensive that could spark a humanitarian disaster. 
The warplanes bombarded countryside around Jisr al-Shughour on the western edge of the rebel enclave of Idlib after weeks of lull, killing 13 civilians but no fighters, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and a rebel source. 
For President Bashar al-Assad, the defeat of rebels in the northwestern province would mean breaking the last major stronghold of active military opposition to his rule, though other large areas also remain beyond his control.
(GRAPHIC: Syrian army prepares assault on Idlib - https://tmsnrt.rs/2NHAqh3)
Washington warned Assad against using chemical weapons, promising a swift response if he did.
Since Russia's entry into the war on his side in 2015, Assad and his other allies, Iran and a group of regional Shi'ite militias, have forced the rebels from a succession of bastions including Aleppo, Eastern Ghouta and Deraa. 
A Syrian government minister said the siege of Idlib would probably be resolved by force. ""Until now, military action is more likely than reconciliations,"" Reconciliation Minister Ali Haidar told Russia's Sputnik news agency.
Damascus uses the term ""reconciliation"" for the negotiated rebel surrenders that have taken place in some areas. 
""Idlib is different from other regions because of the large numbers of fighters,"" Haidar said. ""However we cannot say there is no gateway to reconciliation.""
Half of Idlib's 3 million people have already fled there from their homes in other parts of Syria, according to the United Nations, and any offensive threatens new displacement and human misery. 
It could also spark a wider confrontation with Turkey, a supporter of the rebels, whose army has set up observation posts along the Idlib front lines to deter fighting. 
Turkey's Hurriyet daily reported that Turkish armed forces were reinforcing the Idlib border with M60 tanks, and Reuters television filmed a convoy heading toward the border. 
Tuesday's air strikes came hours after U.S. President Donald Trump warned Assad and his allies not to ""recklessly attack"" Idlib, saying that hundreds of thousands might die.
Trump has twice ordered U.S.-led air strikes against targets in Syria in response to what Washington called the Assad government's use of chemical weapons against civilians.
""If President Bashar al-Assad chooses to again use chemical weapons, the United States and its allies will respond swiftly and appropriately,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Tuesday. 
The U.N. Security Council will discuss Idlib on Friday, Washington's ambassador to the United Nations said. 
""HUMAN SHIELDS""
The Kremlin dismissed his comments on Tuesday, describing Idlib, where jihadist insurgent factions dominate, as a ""nest of terrorism"". Spokesman Dmitry Peskov added: ""We know that Syria's armed forces are preparing to resolve this problem."" 
Iran echoed that theme. ""Terrorist groups (in Idlib) have mixed with the people,"" said Abbas Araqchi, deputy foreign minister, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency. ""They are using people as human shields.""
Idlib's dominant rebel faction is Tahrir al-Sham, an alliance spearheaded by al Qaeda's former official affiliate in Syria, the Nusra Front, though other groups are also present. 
Last week the U.N. envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, said the Nusra Front and al Qaeda, both of which the international body designates as terrorists, had an estimated 10,000 fighters in Idlib. 
On Tuesday de Mistura said talks between Russia and Turkey held the key to resolving the fate of Idlib without a bloodbath. He said he had heard reports that Damascus had set a Sept. 10 deadline for diplomacy to work before attacking. 
Turkey fears a major assault on Idlib could send a new wave of refugees toward its border, and wants to maintain a ""de-escalation agreement"" that it struck with Russia and Iran last year. 
It has staged two major incursions into Syria, creating a buffer zone along its border in an area north of Aleppo that adjoins Idlib, where it has set up a local administration alongside Syrian rebel groups. 
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Turkey was discussing joint action with Russia to target terrorist groups in Idlib while avoiding a full-scale offensive. Ankara last week added Tahrir al-Sham to its list of designated terrorist groups. 
PRETEXT FOR ATTACK? 
Ankara has said the presence of radical groups in Idlib is being used a pretext for a military operation. When he was in Russia in late August, Cavusoglu said ""we have to differentiate terrorists from other people"", but added that it was also important to eliminate Russia's concerns. 
Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, on a visit to Syria, told Iranian state television: ""Our efforts are for ... the exit of terrorists from Idlib to be carried out with the least human cost."" 
He and Peskov said Idlib would be a major subject of discussion at a Sept. 7 summit of Russia's Vladimir Putin, Turkey's Tayyip Erdogan and Iran's Hassan Rouhani. 
Last week a source close to Damascus said the government was preparing a phased assault that would initially target the areas in the south and west of the rebel enclave.

Even a staggered offensive would involve fighting around Turkish observation posts, potentially triggering a new escalation in an already complex war.

The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said analysis by designated laboratories of samples collected by its team ""confirm the findings of the United Kingdom relating to the identity of the toxic chemical.""
Dawn Sturgess, 44, died after she and her partner were exposed to the toxin near the city of Salisbury where Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were struck down with the same poison in March.
The OPCW said ""it is also the same toxic chemical that was found in the biomedical and environmental samples relating to the poisoning of Sergei Skripal"".
The UK has accused Russia, which developed the toxic agent in the Soviet Union era, of poisoning the Skripals. Moscow denies all involvement.

Britain is ready to ask Russia to extradite two men it suspects of carrying out the nerve agent attack on Skripal.

""We cannot give any Syrian province something which differentiates it from other provinces or ethnicities, or (allow it) any situation which strikes at the idea that Syria is one country and one society,"" Reconciliation Minister Ali Haidar said in an interview with Russia's Arabic-language Sputnik news agency.
A Kurdish-led administration in Syria's northeast now holds more territory than any other group in Syria apart from the government itself. The Kurds have mostly avoided direct conflict with government forces during Syria's civil war, while saying they seek autonomy in a decentralized state.
President Bashar al-Assad's government has recaptured most areas from rebels opposed to his rule, frequently using what Damascus calls ""reconciliation"" deals under which insurgents agree to give up territory in return for safe passage out, often after intense air and ground campaigns. Assad has repeatedly pledged to take back ""every inch"" of Syria.
The main Kurdish groups have so far emerged as among the few winners of the conflict in Syria, carving out autonomous rule over large parts of the north under the control of the Kurdish-led and U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) militia.
In recent months they have begun trying to forge ties with Damascus, seeking to protect gains made in seven years of war and wary of their unpredictable U.S. allies. 

""The solution to the problem now is for the Kurdish groups dealing with America to turn their backs on this and turn to the Syrian state,"" Haidar said.

156,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2018 02:50PM ET</span>",Britain's Labour party moves to defuse anti-Semitism row,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's opposition Labour Party adopted an internationally accepted definition of anti-Semitism on Tuesday, trying to defuse a row that has heaped pressure on its leader at a time when the government is struggling over Brexit.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, a veteran campaigner for Palestinian rights, has been criticized by members, lawmakers and Jewish leaders for not fully adopting the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of anti-Semitism.
He has promised to drive anti-Semitism out of Labour, but the pledges have done little to quieten his detractors, with some suggesting he step down for what they describe as his failure to tackle anti-Semitism in the party.
Tuesday's move may still not satisfy all Corbyn's critics after Labour said it also backed a statement that adopting the definition ""will not in any way undermine freedom of expression on Israel or the rights of Palestinians"". 
Gideon Falter, chairman of Campaign Against Antisemitism, said the statement was an ""attempt to undermine the definition’s validity, despite its adoption around the world and the fact that the definition is already heavily caveated"". 
The row has dominated British media, prompting even some of Corbyn's allies to question why their leader had failed to stem the row quickly to allow the party to channel its energies into opposing the government, which is deeply divided over how to leave the European Union next year.
Nevertheless, an opinion poll by Survation on Tuesday showed Labour extending their lead over Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party to 4 percentage points, up from 2 percentage points. Most recent opinion polls show Labour ahead of or level with the Conservatives.
Corbyn was unexpectedly elected leader in 2015, riding a wave of enthusiasm for change that has spread across Europe with voters flocking to anti-establishment movements that have emerged since the 2008 global financial crisis.
Since then, he has cemented his control over the party's structures, able to entrench his move to the left after leading Labour to a surprising success in last year's election by depriving Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservatives of a parliamentary majority.

But his leadership of the party has also angered many of his lawmakers in parliament, where many want the Labour Party to adopt a softer position on Brexit and better represent those who voted to remain in the EU in a 2016 referendum.

Established in 2006, the annual award for work related to vision is one of the world's largest science prizes, more than the latest 9 million Swedish crown ($987,000) Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.
""This is the first, and still only example of successful gene therapy in humans that corrects an inherited genetic defect and is therefore a milestone in medical therapeutics,"" said Alfred Sommer, Dean Emeritus of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and chairman of the award jury.
One of those honored, Michael Redmond of the National Eye Institute in Maryland, had traced the cause of the disease, Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), to a mutated gene.
Three cooperating research teams later managed to replace the gene in the eye, restoring vision to treated children and adults with one form of LCA and ""enabling the entire field of gene therapy for human disease"", the foundation said. 
These teams are comprised of U.S. scientists Jean Bennett and Albert Maguire; Samuel Jacobson and William Hauswirth; and Britons Robin Ali and James Bainbridge.
Their gene augmentation therapy involved the delivery of healthy genes using engineered harmless viruses, described by the foundation as ""an elegant solution"". 

The foundation, which focuses on neuroscience and oncology research at its Lisbon base, was set up at the bequest of Portugal's late industrialist Antonio Champalimaud who died in 2004. The first vision prize was awarded in 2006.

158,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2018 02:42PM ET</span>",Israel says struck Iranian targets in Syria 200 times in last two years,"By Dan Williams
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel has carried out more than 200 attacks against Iranian targets in Syria in the last two years, a senior Israeli official said on Tuesday, in a rare summary of its campaign.
According to regional sources, Israel began carrying out military strikes in Syria in 2013 against suspected arms transfers and deployments by Iranian forces and their Lebanese Hezbollah allies, both Damascus's partners in Syria's civil war.
Israeli officials have rarely detailed specific operations. On Tuesday, an Israeli military spokeswoman declined to comment after Syria said it shot down rockets fired by Israeli planes at military targets near the city of Hama.
But Israeli Intelligence Minister Israel Katz used a speech to give a more general summary of Syria missions, prompted by a military briefing given to local media earlier in the day.
""Only just now it was published - in the name of military sources, so I can quote it too - that in the last two years Israel has taken military action more than 200 times within Syria itself,"" Katz told a conference hosted by the IDC Herzliya college.
""Understand the significance of this matter in terms of preserving the red line, preventing the things that Iran has done, is doing and is trying to do against Israel from Syria.""
Asked to confirm Katz's comments, an Israeli military spokeswoman said Israel had carried out around 200 attacks within Syria over the past year and a half.
In August 2017, the outgoing chief of Israel's air force told Haaretz newspaper that his corps had carried out ""nearly 100 strikes"" in Syria. That left another 100 in the time since, according to the official Israeli accounts issued on Tuesday - or roughly two a week. 
Israel, which monitors neighboring Syria intensively, has long alleged that Iran came to assist the Damascus government, in part, to set up a permanent garrison there, effectively forming an extended anti-Israel front with Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Iran, Israel's arch-foe, has been a core supporter of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad throughout the 7-year-old civil war, sending military advisers as well as materiel and regional Shi'ite militias that it backs.
Israel's Syria strikes have been largely ignored by Russia, Israel's big-power backer, and backed by the United States.
On Monday, Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman signaled that the country could also attack suspected Iranian military targets in Iraq, where Reuters has reported the deployment of ballistic missiles by Tehran.

Briefing reporters on Tuesday, a senior Israeli military officer who requested anonymity said that Israel believed Iran was using Iraqi territory as a conduit for missile transfers to Syria.

159,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2018 02:20PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Nigerians at risk of starvation as U.N. fails to secure aid access, European states say","By Paul Carsten
ABUJA (Reuters) - European states warned the United Nations that more than 800,000 people are cut off from aid and may be starving in northeast Nigeria, contradicting government assertions that a crisis has abated and rebuking the world body for failing to secure access.
Nigeria's government has said this year that an emergency in the northeast caused by a decade-long conflict with Islamist fighters was easing, and efforts should shift from humanitarian relief to longer term development aid.
But in a letter to directors of emergency programs at U.N. and other aid agencies, the EU, Britain, France and Germany said the United Nations was failing to press home the urgency of a disaster which had put children at risk of starvation.
""We are very concerned about urgent and unmet humanitarian and protection needs in North-East Nigeria,"" they wrote. The U.N. mission in Nigeria must push the government to allow ""the rapid, unimpeded and unfettered humanitarian access to people in need of life-saving assistance.""
The letter said 823,000 people were in areas inaccessible to aid in Nigeria's Borno state, the area worst affected by the decade-long insurgency by the Boko Haram Islamist group and its offshoot, Islamic State in West Africa.
Children who have left the area over the past 11 months had shown critical levels of malnutrition, said the letter, reviewed by Reuters.
The European countries, all major donors to the relief effort, called for ""stronger, strategic and consistent advocacy with the Government of Nigeria to uphold their responsibility to protect and assist their citizens.""
The letter was sent to directors of emergency programs through a body called the U.N. Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC).
The IASC referred queries about the letter to the U.N. office in Nigeria. A spokeswoman there said on Monday she was preparing a response, but she had not provided one by Tuesday evening. Representatives of the Nigerian presidency did not respond to a request for comment.
Nigeria's call for a change in emphasis in the northeast away from emergency aid and toward long-term development assistance fits a narrative long expressed by President Muhammadu Buhari that the conflict is waning.
Buhari won election in 2015 on a vow to defeat Boko Haram and restore stability and security to the northeast, and is now seeking a second-term campaigning on his government's success in achieving it.
As part of that effort to portray the northeast as safer, thousands of people have been ordered back to dangerous areas that aid agencies say are inaccessible, and where the condition of hundreds of thousands of people is unknown.
A person familiar with the drafting of the letter said the countries that signed it were trying to express ""a lack of confidence in U.N. leadership in Nigeria.""

""People are nearing starvation and there is little help for those being returned to inaccessible areas. And the humanitarian situation is escalating not getting better.""

Doha is keen to show it is tackling allegations of worker exploitation as it prepares to host the 2022 soccer World Cup, which it has presented as a showcase of its progress and development.
Most migrant workers would be able to leave the country without having to obtain permits from their employers under the law, said the International Labour Organization in a statement via its Doha office.
The ILO hailed the move as a ""significant step"" for gas-rich Qatar, which committed last year to introducing sweeping labor reforms, including changes to the exit visa system.
""The ILO welcomes the enactment of Law No. 13, which will have a direct and positive impact on the lives of migrant workers in Qatar,"" said Houtan Homayounpour, the head of the ILO office in Doha, which was set up in April.
The official Qatar News Agency confirmed the adoption of Law No. 13, saying it amended ""certain provisions"" of previous laws regulating the entry, exit and residency of expatriates. It did not specify which provisions or offer details on the changes.
Labour and rights groups have attacked Qatar for its ""kafala"" sponsorship system, which is common in Gulf states where large portions of the population is foreign.
Qatar's system still requires the country's 1.6 million mainly Asian foreign workers to obtain their employers' consent before changing jobs, which the groups say leaves workers open to abuse.
The government's other pledged reforms include introduction of a minimum wage and a grievance procedure for workers.

LONDON (Reuters) - An exit deal between Britain and the European Union is within sight, Brexit minister Dominic Raab told parliament on Tuesday, as lawmakers from all sides told him the current negotiating plan had little hope of winning their approval.
Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29, 2019 but has yet to secure an agreement to define future relations with Brussels and manage the economic impact of ending over four decades of integration with the world's largest trading bloc.
Brussels has dismissed key elements of Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit strategy, formulated in July at her Chequers country retreat, and it has been widely criticized by both those who want a more radical break from the EU and those who want even closer ties. 
Nevertheless, Raab was upbeat when delivering a summary of progress in the negotiations to parliament on its first day back after the summer break.
""We have made significant progress, we are making significant progress every week ... and a deal is within our sights,"" he said.
However, other lawmakers were less positive, indicating that May's minority government will struggle to find support for whatever deal it strikes with Brussels. May must win parliamentary approval on a deal, or risk leaving the EU without any formal agreement.
""Chequers is a dead as a dodo. The secretary of state (Raab) knows that and so does everyone else in this House,"" said Tom Brake, a lawmaker from the Liberal Democrat party.
Raab said he disagreed, describing the negotiations as ""positive"". 
Earlier, May's spokesman said Britain had to step up efforts to get a deal, describing talks as at a ""crucial and intense phase"".
Nevertheless, with an October deadline for a deal expected to slip into November and little sign of breakthrough on fundamental disagreements with the EU, financial markets remain nervous about the possibility of Britain leaving without a deal. 
A senior official at the Brexit ministry said he was confident that plans were in place for the possibility of a no-deal exit. Raab said that while 'no deal' was not what the government wants, there would be some ""countervailing opportunities"".

But the main opposition Labour Party's Brexit policy chief Keir Starmer said Raab had failed to reassure anyone, and that May's Brexit negotiating strategy would not survive intact.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Firefighters combing through the charred remains of Brazil's National Museum have found a skull that may belong to its star exhibit, an 11,500-year-old woman named Luzia, local TV reported on Tuesday.
A fire broke out in the 200-year-old museum on Sunday evening, destroying the vast majority of its massive collection and igniting a nationwide debate over the role of culture and learning in a society grappling with a frail economy and deep austerity measures.
Globo TV reported that firefighters at the site had found a skull that may belong to Luzia, whose remains are the oldest to be found in Brazil. The cranium has been sent to a lab in order to confirm its provenance, the network said. 
Neither Rio's fire department nor the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, which administers the museum, immediately responded to requests for comment. 
Discovered in 1975, in the central Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, Luzia was probably 25 when she died, according to the museum's website. She was the star of a 20 million-strong collection that also included Egyptian artifacts, archeological finds and historical memorabilia.
A litany of well-known problems, including the lack of a sprinkler system, are believed to have contributed to Sunday's blaze. O Globo newspaper said on Tuesday that it had first reported on the risk of a fire at the museum 40 years ago. 
The museum's pastel-yellow facade was still standing on Tuesday, but a peek inside its giant windows revealed a roofless interior of blackened hallways and charred beams. Local officials said the structure remained vulnerable to collapse.
Some Brazilians see the problems at the museum as a metaphor for the country's broader issues. An increasingly angry electorate will go to the polls in October to pick a new president. 
The museum's directors have accused the federal government of years of insufficient funding for one of Latin America's most important historical repositories. 
However, Brazil's federal government on Tuesday defended its funding of Rio's federal university, accusing the institution of failing to pass on money to the museum.
In a press conference, Dyogo Oliveira, the president of the state-run development bank BNDES, announced a 25 million reais ($6.03 million) plan to fund fire prevention mechanisms at national monuments across the country.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union could offer new guarantees to Britain to win London's support for a solution aimed at avoiding an Irish border after Brexit, a leading EU lawmaker said. 
The EU has made the so-called Irish 'backstop' a condition for any divorce deal before Britain leaves the EU on March 29, 2019, and both sides are under increasing pressure to overcome the outstanding issues.
The chief potential spoiler is the Irish border, where both Britain and the EU fear strict controls could reignite decades of violence on the island.
""We are open to introducing some changes to the backstop solution so that it is politically acceptable for the UK,"" said Danuta Hubner, who chairs the European Parliament's constitutional affairs committee, which must verify any Brexit agreement. 
""It has definitely never been the intention of the EU to threaten the territorial integrity of the UK with the backstop,"" she told Reuters on Tuesday.
""A political reassurance of that sort could compliment the backstop from our side. Solving the Irish issue is a condition for us to end the negotiations positively,"" she said.
An EU diplomat dealing with Brexit in Brussels told Reuters the bloc's negotiator Michel Barnier has presented such an idea during a recent briefing for envoys from the remaining 27 national capitals in Brussels.
Barnier's office had no immediate comment. 
The EU's 'backstop' plan is to keep Northern Ireland in the bloc's economic space even after Brexit and hold border checks in Irish Sea ports, hence introducing no new barriers between the British province and the Republic of Ireland, an EU member.
But British Prime Minister Theresa May said that would amount to pulling Northern Ireland away from the rest of the country and said London would not accept it.
Both sides are working for an agreement for May and the other 27 national leaders in the bloc to endorse in November. 
That would leave just about enough time for the necessary approval by both the British and the EU's parliaments before Brexit day.
The stakes are high as otherwise Britain would crash out of the bloc with no agreement to replace more than four decades of close cooperation with the EU on everything from trade to aviation and food safety. 

The European and British parliaments must sign off on any Brexit agreement sealed by EU leaders for it to take effect.

The storm also caused a jump in global oil prices after the evacuation of two oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico.
Gordon was due to come ashore late on Tuesday near the border between Louisiana and Mississippi, and drop as much as 12 inches (30 cm) of rain in areas still recovering from last year's hurricanes, the National Hurricane Center said.
Currently carrying winds of around 65 miles per hour (105 km per hour), the storm was expected to pack hurricane-force winds - of at least 74 mph (119 kph) - when it reached the Gulf Coast, the center said.
Beaches around Mobile, Alabama, were seeing storm-driven waves on Tuesday morning, said Stephen Miller, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service. 
""We're expecting an increase in winds,"" Miller said in a phone interview. ""We could see flooding.""
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency, as did New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell.
Storm surge - sea levels driven higher - of as much as 5 feet (1.5 m) could hit a stretch of coast from Shell (LON:RDSa) Beach, Louisiana, to Dauphin Island, Alabama, forecasters said. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency told South Mississippi residents to be prepared to evacuate. 
As of Tuesday morning, Gordon was located about 190 miles (305 km) east-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River, and was heading west-northwest, the Miami-based hurricane center said. 
U.S. oil producer Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC) evacuated workers and shut production at two offshore oil platforms on Monday, and other companies with production and refining operations along the Gulf Coast said they were securing facilities. 
The Gulf of Mexico is home to 17 percent of U.S. crude oil and 5 percent of natural gas output daily, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
The U.S. Coast Guard said the ports of New Orleans as well as Gulfport and Pascagoula, Mississippi, may have to close within 48 hours. 
Last year, powerful hurricanes hit Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, causing thousands of deaths, hundreds of billions of dollars worth of damage and massive power outages.
Gordon, which was not forecast to be a major hurricane, was expected to weaken rapidly after moving ashore, the hurricane center said.
The Inn at Ocean Springs and The Roost Hotel in Ocean Springs, Mississippi, had guests planning to ride out the storm, said Kristin Smith, the general manager of both hotels. 

""A lot of guests are real comfortable sticking it out in our rooms,"" Smith said in a phone interview. ""Any of our guests who feel like they want to go home we encourage them to follow their instincts.""

171,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>",Scotland to pay immigration status fees for resident EU citizens,"EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Scotland's devolved government will cover the cost of immigration status fees for European Union citizens working in the Scottish public sector after Brexit, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday.
The British government, trying to defuse business fears of a shortage of workers after Brexit, has said EU citizens will be able to apply for settled status in the UK for a 65-pound ($83) fee.
Sturgeon wants to attract European nationals to shore up Scotland's ageing population but their status is in doubt after Britain leaves the European Union and freedom of movement of EU citizens ends.
""It is simply wrong that people already making a contribution to our country should have to pay to retain rights they currently have to live and work here,"" Sturgeon told the Scottish parliament. 
""However, if the UK government persists, I can confirm that the Scottish government will meet the settled-status fees for EU citizens who work in our devolved public services,"" she said.
Although Britain as a whole opted to leave the EU in a 2016 referendum, Scotland voted to stay, and the independence-minded Sturgeon says Scotland's best future is to stay in the EU as a country in its own right.
Scots voted to stay in the UK in a 2014 referendum but a recent poll showed support for the idea was now rising. 
Sturgeon has been keen to underline Scotland's different policy approach to the rest of the UK.
Announcing her program for government for 2018/19, she reiterated that she will make a decision on whether to call for a new independence vote once it is clearer what Brexit entails.
Limiting the number of foreigners who enter Britain was a major reason behind support for Brexit, and immigration is one of the biggest political issues of Brexit talks. 
Residency, not citizenship, will also be the basis of the right to vote in Scottish parliament and local elections, Sturgeon announced.
""We highly value the contribution of EU citizens who have chosen to make Scotland their home and we want them to stay,"" she said.

Scotland's parliament sets a portion of its own tax rates and decides its own policies in areas including health, education and transport.

A video posted on social media on Tuesday purportedly showed hundreds of Africans, some carrying plastic bags, walking in a long line away from the detention center. It is located on the road to the former Tripoli International Airport, which was destroyed in a battle between rival militias in 2014.
Libya is a major departure point in North Africa for migrants crossing the Mediterranean Sea to Europe, mainly from other parts of Africa.
The aid official, who works for an international organization, said as many as 1,800 migrants might have escaped the facility on Tuesday. It was unclear where they had gone.
If confirmed, this would mean that almost a quarter of Libya's jailed migrants, mostly Africans, are on the run. Most had been jailed after the Libyan coast guard intercepted their makeshift boats bound for Italy.
Fighting between rival Libyan groups lasting for more than one week has spread from the airport, located south of Tripoli, towards the city.
Tripoli is formally controlled by the internationally recognized Government of National Accord, but armed groups working with it act with autonomy. Eastern Libya is controlled by a rival administration.
Last Thursday U.N. agencies and authorities relocated hundreds of migrants from government-run detention centers in southern Tripoli to safer locations.
In a further sign of chaos, some 400 prisoners also escaped on Sunday from a jail in southern Tripoli, forcing open the doors as the guards retreated.
The United Nations mission called for a meeting on Tuesday to discuss the deteriorating security situation, but officials were not available to confirm that it was still going ahead.
The number of illegal migrants crossing the Mediterranean to Europe has fallen off sharply since Italy provided the Libyan coastguard with more boats and brokered deals with local groups in a smuggler hub last year.

But Arndt von Loringhoven, the alliance's assistant secretary general for intelligence and security, said Islamic State retained some personnel strength despite its combat losses, including fresh recruits among women and children. 
""ISIS-Daesh weakening has provided al Qaeda with an opportunity to attempt to regain its former status,"" Von Loringhoven told a security conference hosted by Israel's IDC Herzliya college, using a term for Islamic State. 
""While ISIL-Daesh has occupied the world's attention for the last four-five year, al Qaeda has been quietly rebuilding its global networks and capabilities,"" he said, citing activity in Kashmir, Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, Somalia and North Africa.
""Rather like ISIL-Daesh, al Qaeda's strategic aim is to regain leadership of like-minded militants and extremists. The competition for legitimacy, affiliates and recruits among the two major global extremist groups potentially increases the terrorism threat to NATO and our partners.""
Al Qaeda carried out the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States, prompting U.S.-led wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. U.S. forces killed al Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, in a Pakistani hideout in 2011. Soon after, Islamic State, which is guided by a similarly extremist form of Sunni Islam, arose.
Islamic State's fiefdoms in Syria and Iraq have been largely dismantled in recent years by offensives launched by Damascus and Baghdad with the backing of various foreign coalitions.
Von Loringhoven said NATO estimated that Islamic State's peak strength of around 39,000 fighters in Syria and Iraq had been halved to between 18,000 and 20,000, most of them dispersed around the two countries and ""gone underground"".
""A very worrisome trend is the group's concerted effort to use propaganda to radicalize women and minors, who have emerged as a new target for recruitment relatively recently,"" he said.
""This trend may have led to increased involvement of women and minors in the planning and execution of a number of attacks, including in NATO countries,"" he said.
Citing the arrest in June of a Tunisian man suspected of planning a ricin attack Germany, von Loringhoven said militants could increasingly try to turn to homemade chemical or biological arms or attacks using commercially available drones.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's President Moon Jae-in and U.S. President Donald Trump hope to discuss North Korea on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York this month, Moon's office said on Tuesday, amid lackluster progress on the North's nuclear issues.
Moon and Trump spoke for 50 minutes by telephone on Tuesday, a day before Moon's special envoys were due to visit Pyongyang to discuss a third summit later this month between the liberal South Korean leader and his North Korean counterpart. 
The planned inter-Korean summit follows Trump's cancellation of a visit to Pyongyang by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last month after Pompeo received a belligerent letter from a senior North Korean official.
Moon and Trump agreed in their call ""to explore the idea of meeting in person on the margins of the U.N. General Assembly and having in-depth consultations on strategies and how to cooperate on the peninsula issues,"" Moon's office said in a statement.
Kim vowed during his unprecedented summit with Trump in April in Singapore to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, but the two sides have since made little headway towards that goal. 
Earlier on Tuesday, Chung Eui-yong, chief of the national security office at Seoul's presidential Blue House, said he would deliver a letter from Moon to Kim when he visits the North, without elaborating on its contents. 
Chung said he wanted to discuss with Pyongyang officials ways to achieve the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. 

Seoul will continue to push for a joint declaration of an end to the 1950-53 Korean War within this year with the United States, Chung told reporters.

176,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2018 10:40AM ET</span>",Top U.S. general warns against major assault on Syria's Idlib,"By Phil Stewart
ATHENS (Reuters) - The top U.S. military officer warned on Tuesday that a major Syrian military assault on the rebel-held enclave of Idlib would lead to a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" and instead recommended more narrowly tailored operations against militants there.
The northern province and surrounding areas are the last major swathe of territory held by insurgents fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has been backed by both Russian and Iranian forces in Syria's seven-year-old civil war. 
They are also home to some 3 million civilians.
Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said there was no doubt about the risks to civilians given Idlib's terrain and difficult operating environment. 
""We don't see any way that significant military operations are going to be beneficial to the people of Syria,"" Dunford told reporters during a trip to Athens. ""If major military operations take place we can expect humanitarian catastrophe and I think we would all want to see that be avoided,"" Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters during a trip to Athens.
Last week, a source close to Damascus said the government was preparing a phased offensive to recover Idlib province, but Turkey, whose army has a string of observation posts around the edge of the rebel area, has warned against such an assault. 
Iran has called for militants to be ""cleaned out"" of Idlib.
Dunford estimated there were 20,000 and 30,000 militants inside Idlib but said it was still unclear to him how large of an operation was being planned by the Russian-backed Syrian forces to clear them out of the enclave.
Dunford recommended more tailored operations against the militants.
""I'm suggesting that counter-terrorism operations should take place in a manner that mitigates the risk of the loss of innocent life,"" he said.
Pressed about the best course, Dunford said: ""More of a discussion between the Turks, the Syrians and the Russians at more precise counterterrorism operations -- as opposed to large scale conventional operations -- would be the right approach.""
Dunford's remarks followed a warning on Monday by U.S. President Donald Trump that hundreds of thousands of civilians could be killed by if Syrian and Russian forces ""recklessly attack"" Idlib.

Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, wrote on Twitter late on Monday: ""All eyes on the actions of Assad, Russia, and Iran in Idlib. #NoChemicalWeapons.""

The incident caused no casualties and the embassy said on its Twitter account that it was resuming normal business after police finished their investigation at the scene.
A statement released by Egypt's state information service named the suspect as 24-year-old Abdullah Ayman Abdesamea. 
""Preliminary investigations suggest that he embraces some extremist ideas and was intending to use them to commit an act of aggression,"" the statement said. 
A witness said she heard a blast and then saw a man with a backpack that had caught on fire close to the Semiramis Hotel, across the road from the embassy premises.
The man was then thrown to the ground by security forces as the fire was extinguished, the witness said.
CCTV footage posted on social media appeared to show the man crossing the street before falling to the ground under a puff of smoke.
Another video circulating showed a man in a black T-shirt kneeling on the road amid a crowd of bystanders and police. He had his trousers removed before being led away, and further footage appeared to show him with the T-shirt tied round his head talking to police. 
The incident happened in a road that is partly blocked off with large concrete cubes that prevent direct access to streets adjoining the embassy. 
Shortly afterwards there was an unusually heavy police presence with dozens of officers in the area.

Egypt has been fighting an insurgency led by Islamic State and concentrated in the Sinai Peninsula since the Egyptian military overthrew President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in mid-2013.

The 37 charges against the 61-year-old cleric in the Specialized Criminal Court include spreading discord and incitement against the ruler, according to London-based Saudi rights group ALQST and other activists.
Awdah's son, Abdullah, confirmed the court proceedings and said the accusations against his father included critical tweets and establishing an organization in Kuwait for defending the Prophet Mohammad.
Amnesty International's Saudi Arabia campaigner Dana Ahmed called the reports ""a disturbing trend in the Kingdom (that) sends a horrifying message that peaceful dissent and expression may be met with the death penalty.""
A government communications office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy where public protests and political parties are banned, has witnessed a crackdown on dissent, with dozens of clerics, intellectuals and activists arrested in the past year, even as the authorities enacted some high-profile social and economic reforms.
A roundup of senior royals, ministers and businessmen last November on charges of corruption sent shockwaves through the kingdom, stunning allies and foreign investors. Most of those detainees were released after reaching undisclosed financial settlements with the government.
Awdah, whom U.N. experts have described as a ""reformist"" and an influential religious figure who has urged greater respect for human rights within Sharia, was arrested in Sept. 2017.
He had previously criticized the government but more recently kept silent or failed to publicly back Saudi policies, including a rift with Qatar over supporting the Muslim Brotherhood.
The Al Saud family has always regarded Islamist groups as the biggest internal threat to its rule over a country in which appeals to religious sentiment cannot be lightly dismissed and an al Qaeda campaign a decade ago killed hundreds.
In the 1990s, the Brotherhood-inspired Sahwa (Awakening) movement demanded political reforms that would have weakened the ruling family. Awdah, a Sahwa leader, was imprisoned from 1994-99 for agitating for political change. Criticism of the ruling family earned him praise from Osama bin Laden, whom he eventually denounced.
The Sahwa movement was later undermined by a mixture of repression and co-optation. Some clerics, however, maintained large followings through YouTube sermons. Awdah has 14 million Twitter followers.
In 2011, he called for elections and separation of powers, principles antithetical to strict Islamist ideology. He has since been largely quiet on issues of domestic reform.
The authorities recommended the death penalty last month for five human rights activists from the kingdom's Eastern Province, including Israa al-Ghomgham, the first woman to possibly face that punishment for rights-related work.

A section of the 50-year-old Morandi bridge in the northern city of Genoa collapsed on Aug. 14 sending dozens of cars plunging to the ground and killing 43 people.
The bridge is part of the A10 motorway, which links Genoa to the French border and is managed by toll-road operator Autostrade, a unit of infrastructure group Atlantia.
Genoa prosecutors are investigating the causes of the collapse. A source with the prosecutors' office on Tuesday said that so far nobody had been formally placed under investigation, but that this was expected to happen soon.
The investigative source said that the list of 13 people included top executives of Autostrade as well as senior officials at Italy's transportation ministry.
Both Autostrade and the ministry declined to comment.
Autostrade, which has come under fire from Italy's government for the disaster, has said in the past that it carried out checks on the bridge as required by law.
Under Italian rules, the motorway operator is responsible for maintenance, while the ministry has a supervisory role. 

Autostrade had been planning to strengthen the stays of the bridge and had launched a tender in April for the contract after obtaining the necessary approval from the ministry.

BAMAKO (Reuters) - Malian President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita promised on Tuesday to address deteriorating security caused by an Islamist insurgency and inter-ethnic clashes as he was sworn in for a second five-year term.
Hundreds of supporters and local politicians attended the ceremony in the capital Bamako, which followed Keita's landslide victory last month in an election marred by militant attacks and claims of fraud by his opposition rival.
Mali has been in turmoil since Tuareg rebels and loosely allied Islamists took over the desert north in 2012. French forces intervened the following year to beat back the militants, but they have since regrouped.
The regular attacks by militants linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State in Mali and neighboring Niger and Burkina Faso have alarmed Western powers like France and the United States who have poured troops and air power into the region. 
""This election is not the victory of one Malian against another, it is the victory of all of Mali,"" Keita, 73, dressed in a flowing white boubou robe and matching cap, told the audience. 
""I chose to place the re-establishment of peace and security at an absolute level of priority,"" said the president, universally referred to as IBK, promising to revive the stalled implementation of 2015 peace deal with ethnic militia.
But the security situation has only deteriorated in recent months. Threats by jihadists forced nearly 500 polling stations - about 2 percent of the total - to remain closed during last month's run-off even as no major attack materialized.
A U.N. camp for peacekeepers near the northern town of Menaka came under rocket fire early on Tuesday, injuring the head of security and a police official, Malian army spokesman Hama Ag Attaher told Reuters. 
Violence between different ethnic groups in Mali's previously peaceful center has also escalated. Armed men dressed as Donzo hunters killed a dozen Fulani civilians in the Mopti region last week, local sources said. 
The security threat as well as general voter apathy reduced turnout in the run-off to 34 percent. 

Keita's challenger, opposition leader Soumaila Cisse, also accused the president's camp of widespread vote rigging but Keita rejected those charges in his speech and called on the opposition to rally around him.

Earlier on Tuesday, Russia resumed its air strikes against insurgents in Idlib after 22 days, following weeks of aerial bombardment and shelling against rebels by pro-Syrian government forces in an apparent prelude to a full-scale offensive.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has sworn to recapture every inch of Syria and has made big gains against rebels since Russia joined his war effort in 2015. 
Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said Iran, which also backs Assad, was making efforts to remove militants from Idlib with the least human cost.
Turkey, which has backed some rebels against Assad, has previously said that a military operation into Idlib, the last major rebel enclave in the country, would be disastrous. 
U.S. President Donald Trump warned Assad and his allies on Monday not to ""recklessly attack"" Idlib, saying hundreds of thousands of people could be killed. Russia, however, dismissed the comments and said the area was a ""nest of terrorism"".
During talks in Ankara on Tuesday, Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar told U.S. special representative for Syria, James Jeffrey, that Turkey wanted Kurdish militants to fully abandon the region, the ministry said in a statement.
It said Akar and Jeffrey also discussed recent developments in Syria and the minister conveyed Turkey's discomfort with the presence of Kurdish militants in the region.
The request comes as Turkish and U.S. forces are carrying out joint patrols in the northwestern Syrian city of Manbij as part of a roadmap to clear the area of YPG militants.
Turkey has been infuriated with Washington's support for the YPG militia, which Ankara sees as an extension of the insurgent Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). Turkey has also carried out two-cross border operations against the YPG in Syria.
In a move long sought by Turkey, the NATO allies agreed in June to implement a roadmap for the northern Syrian city of Manbij, where Ankara had threatened to push its ground offensive despite the U.S. troops stationed there. 

Ankara and Washington have more recently been at a stand-off over the fate of a U.S. evangelical pastor being tried in Turkey on terrorism charges that he denies. The widening row has sent Turkey's lira currency plunging some 40 percent this year.

LEICESTER, England (Reuters) - Armed police shin up ladders to scale an imposing security fence and rush past palm trees to raid a sprawling mock-Tudor property in search of evidence.
The household in this English midlands city is clearly a very prosperous one. Police suspect this is the home of the boss of a illegal moneylending operation, surfing on Britain's rising tide of debt and wrecking countless lives in the process.
The target was not at home at the time of the early-morning swoop, nor at the suspect's ostensible business, a local garage, which was raided at the same time. Police said their search would continue.
The operation on Tuesday was the latest by the England Illegal Money Lending Team (IMLT), a Birmingham-based unit tasked with cracking down on loan sharks lending cash to vulnerable borrowers at exorbitant interest rates.
It's not just a technical breach of financial regulations. ""The debt is unenforceable in law, so the ways they make people pay can be extreme,"" said Tony Quigley, head of the team.
""We have seen kidnapping, psychological intimidation, wounding and in one case, rape.""
Quigley told Reuters his team were conducting ""a couple"" of similar operations a week, and that he believed loan sharking was a problem in ""most towns and cities across the country"".
""People can be unwilling to come forward because they are frightened and there is a stigma attached. But we need people to be brave and come forward. If you're in the clutches of a loan shark, ring us and we will deal with it.""
Blue-gloved police involved in Tuesday's raids seized documents, electronic devices and a large quantity of cash and jewelry that could prove the suspect's links to a loan-shark operation they had been tracking for several months.
The size of Britain's ""below-the-radar"" illegal loan business is hard to assess but police believe it is worth around 750 million pounds ($960 million) a year, Quigley said.
SMALL TO SOPHISTICATED
It ranges from small-scale lending via word-of-mouth introduction in housing estates and workplaces, to sophisticated schemes extracting payments through a network of contacts for years.
A court in March 2017 ordered a hospital consultant from northwest London to pay back 525,000 pounds in proceeds of his illegal lending scheme.
Dr Arjan Damjibhai Savani had preyed on members of the Filipino community working at the same hospital, his trial was told.
Such illegal lending comes on top of a growing 1.8 trillion-pound household debt pile in Britain that the Bank of England warned in June could pose a risk to the country's financial stability, especially if the economy deteriorates after Brexit.
Legal high-cost lenders are under pressure. Britain's biggest payday lender Wonga collapsed into administration last week, following a spike in compensation claims and a regulatory crackdown on its business model.
Wonga was the most high-profile of a group of high-interest, short-term lenders that sprang up in Britain in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, whose marketing tactics and four-figure interest rates drew strong criticism from lawmakers.
Cuts to government benefits, stagnant wages and a reduction in banks' willingness to lend to the poor have since the 2008 crisis pushed many households' finances to the brink.
Unsecured borrowing such as credit card debt rose to a record 213 billion pounds in June.
The Bank of England in August pushed interest rates above their financial crisis lows, in a move debt advice charities said could further pressure overstretched household budgets.
Sky-high housing costs in parts of Britain are driving a rise in landlord lenders, Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said in a report last year on illegal lending.
Loan sharks trap desperate borrowers in debt indefinitely to guarantee an income stream, it said.
The police IMLT unit said it funneled money seized from loan sharks toward local credit unions in Britain, which offer lower-cost alternatives to both authorized and the illegal high-cost lenders.
The IMLT says it has written off more than 73 million pounds in debt owed to loan sharks since it was formed in 2004.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland's prime minister on Tuesday formally proposed extending a deal with the main opposition party to back his minority government beyond this year, asking it to agree an election date for the summer of 2020.
Leo Varadkar's Fine Gael-led government operates through a ""confidence and supply"" deal with the largest opposition party, Fianna Fail, which has agreed to abstain from opposition-driven votes against the government until the end of 2018.
Varadkar said earlier this year he wanted to renew the pact and that talks to do so should start well ahead of its expiry. In a letter to Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin published on Tuesday, he said he was ready to start negotiations immediately.
""A government cannot function properly if it does not know if it will last from week to week, month to month, or if it does not know what will happen the day after the budget,"" Varadkar said, referring to a budget for 2019 which will be presented on October 9.
""Such uncertainty weakens our hand in Brexit talks, at a time of increasing international uncertainty.""
Some senior Fianna Fail lawmakers have said they are open to extending the deal for another year, but Martin reiterated in a response published by his party on Tuesday that he would not begin talks on a possible extension until after the budget was announced.
He did not respond directly to Varadkar's call to set a 2020 election date.
With Fine Gael leading Fianna Fail in opinion polls by a wider margin than at the last election in 2016, a senior Fianna Fail member of parliament who negotiated the original pact accused Varadkar of trying to orchestrate a snap election.
""I think the letter is a distraction and is unnecessarily creating instability,"" Jim O'Callaghan told national broadcaster RTE.
""What we need to do now is get agreement on the next budget. After that, we have no difficulty sitting down and discussing whether it should be renewed or not,"" he added.

""My own view, and maybe I've a cynical mind, is that I believe the Taoiseach (Prime Minister) wants to have a general election in October or November, and that's why I think he is orchestrating a mechanism to get out of it (the 'confidence and supply' deal).""

188,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2018 09:20AM ET</span>","After far-right demos, AfD overtakes German Social Democrats","BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has overtaken the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), a poll showed on Tuesday, days after some of the most violent protests by radical right-wingers the country has seen in decades.
Some 6,000 supporters of the AfD and anti-Islam PEGIDA joined protests in the eastern city of Chemnitz on Saturday following other demonstrations last week after a man was stabbed to death there on Aug. 26. Two immigrants were arrested for the killing.
An INSA poll on Tuesday put the AfD up half a percentage point at 17 percent, with the SPD, who share power with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives, slipping by the same amount to 16 percent. Merkel's conservative bloc was on 28.5 percent.
Germany's next electoral test comes on Oct. 14 when Merkel's Bavarian allies face a major challenge from the AfD for state government.
The AfD, the third-biggest party in last year's election and main opposition, seized on the killing of a 35-year old German in Chemnitz and the subsequent arrests of a Syrian and Iraqi to ramp up criticism of Merkel's open-door asylum policy. 
Prosecutors said on Tuesday they are looking for a third suspect and Der Spiegel reported there was some doubt about the identity of two already under arrest.
Pictures showed skinheads at last week's protests chasing migrants through the streets, hurling bottles and fireworks and some even making the Hitler salute, illegal in Germany.
Calls have mounted for the domestic intelligence agency to place the AfD under surveillance.
Bjoern Hoecke, an AfD leader from the state of Thuringia who has criticized Germany's main memorial to the victims of the Holocaust as a ""monument of shame"" and wants Germany to re-write its history books, took part in Saturday's march in Chemnitz.

In a show of resistance against the right-wing ""mob"", some 65,000 people attended a rock concert ""against xenophobia"" on Monday night in Chemnitz given by mostly left-leaning groups.

The attack on Monday on the outskirts of the city of Beni underscored the challenges authorities face in tackling a flare-up of the deadly disease in an active conflict zone stalked by dozens of armed groups.
Health officials say they have made progress slowing the hemorrhagic fever's spread with experimental vaccines and treatments. But they cannot be sure the situation is under control due to difficulties accessing some areas.
The peacekeepers' patrol was attacked in the town of Ngadi by militants believed to belong to the Allied Democratic Forces, a Ugandan Islamist group active in eastern Congo, said Florence Marchal, spokeswoman for the U.N. mission known as MONUSCO. 
""Two soldiers were wounded and their condition was deemed stable this morning,"" she told Reuters.
The current Ebola outbreak is believed to have killed 81 people since July and infected another 40. Nineteen of those cases have been in Beni, a city of several hundred thousand people with close trading links to neighboring Uganda.
The outbreak is Congo's 10th since Ebola was discovered in 1976 in the country's north, but the first to affect its densely-populated eastern borderlands. 
MONUSCO peacekeepers are providing near-daily escorts to the town of Oicha, where one case has been confirmed, World Health Organization spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told reporters in Geneva.
Parts of the 30 km (18 mile) stretch of road between Beni and Oicha are considered a 'red zone' because of recurrent rebel attacks.

Trump on Monday warned Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his allies Iran and Russia not to ""recklessly attack"" the northwestern Syrian province, saying hundreds of thousands of people could be killed.
""Just to speak out with some warnings, without taking into account the very dangerous, negative potential for the whole situation in Syria, is probably not a full, comprehensive approach,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
The presence of militants in Idlib was undermining the Syrian peace process and making the region a base for attacks on Russian forces in Syria, Peskov added.
""A fairly large group of terrorists has settled there and of course this leads to a general destabilization of the situation. It undermines attempts to bring the situation onto the track of a political-diplomatic settlement,"" he said. 
""We know that Syria's armed forces are preparing to resolve this problem,"" he added. 
Russia resumed air strikes against insurgents in Idlib province on Tuesday after a hiatus of several weeks, according to a Syrian rebel and a war monitor. 
A source has told Reuters that Assad is preparing a phased offensive to regain the province.

The situation around Idlib will be one of the main items on the agenda when the leaders of Russia, Iran and Turkey meet in Tehran this week, Peskov told reporters on a conference call, declining to elaborate further.

There was no immediate comment from Iranian authorities, and Reuters was not able to contact the judiciary.
Sotoudeh’s husband, Reza Khandan - who has campaigned for her release - said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Monday he had been called in for questioning by the Ministry of Intelligence. He said that when he objected he was told, “Then you’ll be arrested.”
Sotoudeh has represented a string of rights activists including women who removed their headscarves in public to protest against Iran's dress code, according to the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran.
The prominent lawyer served about half of a six-year jail sentence imposed in 2010 for spreading propaganda and conspiring to harm state security - charges she denied - before being freed in 2013.
She was arrested again in June and Khandan told Iranian media at the time she was facing security charges.
“First the authorities jail Nasrin Sotoudeh on bogus charges, then harass, intimidate and threaten her family and friends, and now arrest her husband,” Philip Luther, Amnesty International's Research and Advocacy Director for the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement. 
The Ministry of Intelligence could not be reached for comment.
In late August, Sotoudeh began a hunger strike in prison to protest against the recent arrest of a prominent civil rights activist and what she called the harassment of his, and her own, family by security forces.

192,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2018 08:27AM ET</span>",Germany concerned about possible 'sleeper' cyber sabotage,"By Andrea Shalal
BERLIN (Reuters) - A growing number of countries can hack into private computer networks and install malicious software to sabotage another country's infrastructure, Germany's domestic spy chief said.
China, Russia and other countries continued to try to break into German companies' computers to steal valuable industrial information, Hans-Georg Maassen, head of the BfV domestic intelligence agency, told a security conference.
But intelligence officials are increasingly worried about so-called ""cyber bombs"" that could be planted in the network of an unsuspecting company and detonated later .
""In the case of China, Russia, we clearly see measures like espionage, but it could also be sabotage with the goal of attacking companies in Germany - infrastructure firms in the widest sense - at some future point,"" Maassen said. ""That is a scenario that we view with concern.""
Cyber experts warn that Germany - with its high level of technology expertise - is a particularly attractive target for cyber attackers of all kinds, including state actors.
A company could be completely oblivious to a cyber attack that had been used to plant malware - a ""cyber bomb"", Maassen said. Then the bomb could shut down power networks, for example, perhaps during a time of geopolitical tension.
He said such attacks could come from a range of countries that have expanded their cyber expertise. In its annual report, the agency cited rapid strides in cyber technology by Iran, although it did not specifically spell out concerns about such sleeper attacks.
Germany is also increasingly concerned that China is seeking to gain dominant positions in key technology sectors by investing in German firms as part of its larger ""Made in China 2025"" drive, Maassen said.
""That is a political project in which the government is spending a lot of money, not just to invest, but to buy information for its own technical progress, or to gain a position in specific areas that will make it impossible for others to continue developments there,"" he said.
Maassen's remarks come amid a push by Germany and other European Union states to protect sensitive technologies from Chinese takeovers. In December, the BfV also warned about efforts by China to use fake LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) accounts to recruit German business executives and researchers as spies.

193,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>",Catalan government to relaunch campaign to split from Spain,"By Sonya Dowsett
MADRID (Reuters) - Catalan leader Quim Torra will relaunch on Tuesday his region's campaign to split from Spain, rebuffing an offer from the central government in Madrid for a referendum on greater autonomy that would fall well short of independence.
Torra, who is due to set out his separatist roadmap at a lecture entitled ""Our Moment"" on Tuesday evening, was sworn in as regional head in May, replacing Carles Puigdemont who fled to Brussels last year after Madrid removed him from office.
Spain's new socialist prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, has taken a softer line towards Catalonia since taking over from Mariano Rajoy, a conservative, in June, but Torra has shown no sign of shelving his demand for a vote on full independence.
""I will take it to the end,"" Torra said in a television interview on Monday. ""I will take it as far as the Catalan parliament wants me to go.""
His lecture comes one week ahead of the Catalan national day, the 'Diada', which traditionally draws hundreds of thousands of separatists onto the streets. Torra has called for a big turn-out this year to show continued support for Catalan secession.
Sanchez proposed on Monday a referendum on greater Catalan autonomy, but he has firmly ruled out any referendum on independence or any unilateral attempt by Catalonia to secede. 
The prime minister met Torra in Madrid in July, moved Catalan separatist prisoners closer to home and lifted financial controls on the region in an attempt to repair relations with Barcelona. 
He also hopes to convince Catalan separatists parties to back his national budget further down the road and avoid a potential snap election next spring.
TRIALS LOOMING
However, the pro-independence speaker of the Catalan parliament on Tuesday dismissed Sanchez's offer of a vote on greater autonomy.
""A referendum on self-determination is what the majority of the Catalan people wants and that is what we must attend to,"" said speaker Roger Torrent in a radio interview.
A Catalan government source said Torra would demand a new referendum on independence in his speech on Tuesday.
Catalonia unilaterally declared independence last year after a banned and chaotic Oct. 1 referendum on secession from Spain, prompting then-premier Rajoy to impose direct rule from Madrid. 
Spain's constitution states that the country is indivisible and courts ruled the October vote was illegal.
Sanchez's Socialists backed the imposition of direct rule but lifted it in June after Torra was elected leader. But they have said they are ready to re-impose direct rule if the new regional administration disobeys national laws.
Nine Catalan politicians and activists are in pre-trial detention on charges of rebellion for their part in organizing the illegal referendum one year ago.

Their trials could start as early as October, further fanning tensions as Sanchez seeks a compromise with Barcelona.

194,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2018 08:10AM ET</span>",Swedish center-left holds small lead ahead of Sept. 9 election,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden's center-left bloc holds a small but stable lead over the center-right Alliance ahead of Sunday's election, two opinion polls showed on Tuesday, but forming a government after the vote may be extremely difficult.
The Social Democrats with junior coalition partner the Greens - together with the Left Party - hold a lead of around 4 percent over the center-right opposition bloc, opinion polls by Kantar Sifo and Ipsos published by newspapers Svenska Dagbladet and Dagens Nyheter showed.
All the mainstream parties have promised to exclude the Sweden Democrats, a party with roots in the far-right fringe, polling 16-18 percent. 
In turn, the Sweden Democrats have vowed to bring down any government that does not give them a say over immigration policy, leaving no clear successor to the current coalition.
""It is likeliest we will see a single-party, Social Democrat government,"" said Nick Aylott, a political scientist at Sodertorn University.
Prime Minister Stefan Lofven hopes to hold on to power by persuading center-right Alliance members, the Centre and Liberal parties, to support his center-left government rather than make a deal with the Sweden Democrats.
""Even if we are bigger (than the Alliance) I will seek some form of cooperation across the political divide,"" he told Reuters on Monday.
He said that could mean organized cooperation in parliament or other forms of collaboration. 
For the Centre and Liberal parties, the option of a Social Democrat government may be more palatable than an Alliance government that is smaller than the center-left and is supported by the Sweden Democrats.
The Moderates, the biggest party in the Alliance, have said they will try to oust Lofven in a mandatory vote on the prime minister's post after the election.
But the party is facing its worst result since the turn of the century. If their recent downward trend continues, it could be the worst since the early 1970s. That would undermine leader Ulf Kristersson's claim on the premiership, which would also rely on support from the Sweden Democrats.
After a turbulent period in government, the Green party may opt to step out of the limelight. The party nearly left the coalition in 2015 over the Social Democrats' plan to tighten immigration policy. The Social Democrats have said stricter asylum rules are here to stay.
The Social Democrats got around 26 percent in the two polls. The Moderates around 17 percent, roughly the same as the Sweden Democrats.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and India will seek to finalize a number of defense agreements during high-level talks this week that aim to draw their two militaries closer and counter-balance China's influence in the region.
U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will hold talks with India's Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj and Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for the so-called two-plus-two discussions.
Already canceled twice this year, it is the highest level of dialogue between the two countries and was agreed upon by U.S. President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
Officials and experts believe that the meeting is not only symbolically important, but will give the world's two largest democracies a chance to make concrete progress while ironing out significant differences, including over India's ties with Russia and Iran.
""The 2+2 presents an historic opportunity to develop our growing partnership and to explore ways of enhancing our security cooperation,"" the top U.S. military officer, Marine General Joseph Dunford, told reporters traveling with him to the talks. 
The talks will be held on Thursday.
Randall Schriver, the Pentagon's top Asia official, predicted last week that the discussions would produce ""a set of actual concrete outcomes.""
The United States and India have increased defense ties over the past decade, in part because of mutual concerns over an increasingly assertive China. 
India has been alarmed at China's expanding security and economic links in South Asia. The nuclear-armed Asian giants were locked in a 10-week military stand-off last year in a remote, high-altitude stretch of a boundary in the Himalayas. 
Earlier this year, the U.S. military renamed its Pacific Command the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, a move underscoring the growing importance of India to the Pentagon.
Among the topics for discussion, the United States is hoping to finalize an agreement on a communications framework that would allow for securely sharing information. 
The Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) has long been a demand of the United States and would open the door for Washington to sell sensitive defense equipment to India, like the armed version of Guardian drones.
India has historically been opposed to the agreement because it sees it as being too intrusive. Earlier this year however, an Indian defense source told Reuters that New Delhi had shed its opposition to the agreement.
""That would be a big deal, if that announcement comes out of this... in terms of advancing the interoperability, that would really be a kind of big next step,"" said Alyssa Ayres, a former U.S. State Department official and now a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.
The two sides are also negotiating another agreement, a Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA), which would enable them to share advanced satellite data for navigation and missile targeting, Indian military sources said. 
The United States is keen to tap into India's large defense market. It has emerged as India's No. 2 weapons supplier, closing $15 billion worth of deals over the last decade.
A senior U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the two countries were looking at a carrying out a major joint exercise - involving troops on land, at sea and in the air. Further details were not immediately available. 
The two countries hold elaborate navy-to-navy maneuvers, air exercises and even drills involving Special Forces, but war games involving all three arms represent a scaling up of defense cooperation. 
WAIVERS FROM SANCTIONS
Despite the optimism, U.S. officials acknowledge that the two countries will also discuss significant disagreements.
""India wonders about the coherence of U.S. strategy and worries the U.S. is pursuing policies inimical to key Indian interests like its continued dependence on Russian military hardware and Iranian oil,"" said Sameer Lalwani, co-director of the South Asia program at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington.
The United States is concerned about India's planned purchase of Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile systems.
The United States has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia, under which any country engaged with its defense and intelligence sectors could face secondary U.S. sanctions. However, a new defense bill gives the president the authority to grant waivers in case of national security interests.
Schriver, from the Pentagon, said there was no guarantee India would get a waiver if it bought the Russian system but was open to speaking with India about providing alternative systems.
India has nearly concluded commercial negotiations with Russia for the missile systems and intends to proceed with it as part of its defenses against China, a defense ministry official said. 
For months, the two sides have been aiming to reach an agreement on the deal before Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to India, planned for early October for annual summit talks. 
The United States is also pushing countries to halt oil imports from Iran after Trump withdrew from a 2015 deal between Iran and six world powers.
India, Iran's top oil buyer after China, has so far not decided on the size of any cut to Iranian imports and continues to seek a waiver from the United States.
U.S. sanctions on Iran's energy sector are set to be re-imposed after a 180-day ""wind-down period"" ending on Nov. 4.

""I think we need to sit and have that very open, candid, sober dialogue and see where we come out the other side,"" Schriver said.

North Korea, locked in a standoff with the United States over its nuclear and missile programmes, is preparing to host a number of major events for the Sept. 9 anniversary, including a military parade, possible visits by foreign delegations, and - for the first time in five years - a massive choreographed performance known as the ""Mass Games.""
There had been speculation in diplomatic circles that Xi himself would go. Xi and North Korea's youthful leader, Kim Jong Un, have met three times this year, each time in China.
Xinhua gave few details about the visit of parliament chief Li Zhanshu, who is the third most senior member of China's ruling Communist Party, in its brief report on Tuesday, aside from saying he would arrive on Saturday.
In a separate reports, the North's KCNA news agency said Li would visit ""from Sept. 8"", without saying how long he would stay.
Kim met U.S. President Donald Trump in June and agreed to ""work toward the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula"", but negotiations since then appear to have stalled with both sides increasingly criticising the other for a lack of progress.
Trump last month cancelled a planned visit to North Korea by his top diplomat, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, citing insufficient progress in the denuclearization talks.
Trump has also questioned China's role in helping to resolve the crisis over North Korea's development of nuclear weapons that threaten the United States, and has said that while China is exerting ""tremendous pressure"" it is also supplying Pyongyang with ""considerable aid"".
China says it is committed to enforcing the harsh U.N. sanctions on North Korea and has also welcomed the talks between Trump and Kim.

China has long feared chaos or war on the Korean peninsula, and has repeatedly called for talks to resolve tensions.

Haqqani, who founded the network in the 1970s, gave up operational leadership of the group some years ago to his son Sirajuddin, who is now deputy leader of the Afghan Taliban, with a $5-million U.S. bounty on his head.
""Haqqani had become quite old and was suffering from different health problems,"" said one Taliban source close to the Haqqani family.
The Taliban issued a statement on Haqqani's death but did not say where or when he died but said he had been ill and bed-ridden for several years.
Defense ministry spokesman Mohammad Radmanish said the death was not expected to mean any major change for the Haqqani network, blamed by Afghan and U.S. security officials for some of the most devastating suicide attacks of the past decade.
""Operationally, his death will not have an impact on the group,"" he said, adding that Haqqani's role in recent years was ideological rather than practical.
Haqqani achieved prominence as a guerrilla leader in the U.S.-backed campaign against Soviet forces occupying Afghanistan during the 1980s but later allied himself with the Taliban, fighting American troops after the Taliban were ousted in 2001.
Haqqani is considered to have introduced suicide bombing to Afghanistan, where it was previously unknown, and his group became notorious for complex, well-organized attacks on both Afghan and U.S. military, as well as civilian targets and high-profile kidnappings.
Last year, a bomber believed to have been sent by the network blew himself up in the heart of the government and embassy district in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing about 150 people.
With hopes for peace talks raised by an unprecedented ceasefire in June, news of the death of one of the most notorious militant commanders comes at a sensitive time for both the Taliban and Kabul's Western-backed government.
Jalaluddin Haqqani's death has been reported a number of times over recent years and the reports have never been disproved.
A security official in Kabul, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to be quoted by name, said Afghan intelligence services believed that Haqqani had in fact died some three years ago.
The official said the announcement of the death should be seen in connection with increased pressure from the United States on Pakistan over U.S. accusations Pakistan is not doing enough to defeat militant groups on its territory.
U.S. and Afghan officials have long said the group was based in Pakistan's border region of North Waziristan, was for years close to al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden and operated with the support of Pakistani intelligence services.
Pakistan has rejected that accusation and has pointed to the network's early links to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency as it grew in strength during the anti-Soviet Mujahideen war of the 1980s.

No comment was immediately available from the Pakistan.

Kosovo is one of the countries in the South-East European Cooperation Process, whose ministers are to meet on Wednesday in Banja Luka, de facto capital of Bosnia's Serb Republic, Republika Srpska.
""I have canceled my participation in the meeting ... because of the threats of the Republika Srpska President, Milorad Dodik, who today ... said me and my delegation are not welcome in Banja Luka,” Pacolli said on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) profile late on Monday.
Dodik said on Monday his region had never recognized Kosovo and that ""the minister of that fake country cannot be welcome in Republika Srpska"", according to the Bosnian Serb news agency Srna. 
Bosnia, which is split in two ethnically-based regions under a weak central government, has not recognized Kosovo because of the objections of the Bosnian Serbs, who follow the policy of their allies in neighboring Serbia. 
Kosovo was once a province of Serbia but declared independence in 2008, almost a decade after a NATO bombing campaign ended a crackdown by Serbian authorities against secessionists among Kosovo's majority ethic Albanian population. 
Belgrade continues to refuse to recognize the institutions of independent Kosovo and has repeatedly boycotted international meetings attended by Kosovo officials. 
""With politicians like Dodik the region cannot go any further,"" Pacolli wrote on Facebook, adding that Kosovo remained committed to regional cooperation.
Dodik advocates the secession of the Serb Republic from Bosnia and has intensified nationalist rhetoric ahead of an Oct. 7 general election in Bosnia.
Bosnia's Foreign Ministry, which is organizing the Banja Luka meeting, could not confirm that Pacolli had canceled his participation.
The EU has set Serbia and Kosovo the condition of normalizing their relations to advance towards EU membership. The Balkan neighbors agreed in 2013 to resolve pending issues but have made little progress since.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Part of a Hong Kong high-speed railway station formally came under Chinese jurisdiction on Tuesday, an unprecedented move that has raised concerns about the Chinese-ruled territory's promised autonomy.
Hong Kong was handed back from British to Chinese rule in 1997 with constitutional guarantees it would continue to enjoy rights and freedoms not granted in mainland China, including an independent legal system.
Chinese and Hong Kong officials argue the so-called ""co-location"" arrangement, including a joint immigration checkpoint, is necessary for passengers' convenience, shrinking rail travel times to mainland cities.
But critics, including pro-democracy advocates and an influential lawyers' association, have denounced the move as the most retrograde since 1997, undermining confidence in the city's vaunted rule of law.
Hong Kong and mainland Chinese officials shook hands inside the new station in West Kowloon district on Monday night to mark the new arrangement, which will mean that anyone who commits a crime in the ""mainland port area"" or onboard trains will be subject to mainland laws, that could include the death penalty for serious crimes.
In an unusual move, the media was not notified of the event. But Hong Kong's leader sought to assuage public concerns. 
""There was no such thing as a sneaky opening,"" said Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam, without explaining why the media wasn't invited.
The Hong Kong Journalists' Association condemned the government for its secrecy.
""The commissioning of the Mainland Port Area and the stationing of mainland officers at the terminus will bring about profound impacts in Hong Kong,"" the statement said.
""The government only chose to issue a press release at five minutes after midnight. We condemn such arrangement, which is inappropriate."" 
One prominent Hong Kong blog, the Big Lychee, dubbed it a ""secret underground ritual"" for ""essentially a handover of territory from Hong Kong to the mainland"". 
Mainland authorities will conduct customs, immigration and quarantine duties in part of the station, while mainland Public Security Bureau officers would be responsible for ""managing public order"", the Hong Kong government said in a booklet.
Hong Kong's Security Bureau gave no response to Reuters questions on how many mainland staff would be deployed at the station. Hong Kong's Ming Pao newspaper put the figure at 700, including 80 public security officers.
Lam said mainland authorities weren't authorized to enforce the law outside the cross-boundary restricted area, and most staff would return to mainland China every day after work, though a few might be required to work overnight shifts.
Tanya Chan, a pro-democracy lawmaker who leads a ""co-location concern group"", said Hong Kong had now lost legal oversight over one million square feet in the heart of the city.
""This arrangement is illegal and unconstitutional. This is the darkest day for our judicial independence and the rule of law,"" Chan told reporters.
Several legal challenges, including a judicial review seeking to bar the project, are pending, despite the station's planned public opening on Sept. 23.

Several other major cross-border infrastructure projects are also expected to be finished this year, including a sea bridge linking Hong Kong to Macau and southern China.

PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron hopes to draw a line under a raft of troubles plaguing his 16-month-old presidency and to re-energize his economic reform drive with a cabinet reshuffle on Tuesday 
Macron was forced into the move by the surprise exit of his former ecology minister, Nicolas Hulot, who said he despaired at what he felt were hollow commitments on environmental policy.
Resigning live on air last week, Hulot's resignation was a setback for the 40-year-old French leader, who returned from the summer break reeling from a bodyguard scandal and preparing to embark on a new wave of economic reforms.
Benjamin Griveaux, government spokesman, said the cabinet would be complete in time for Wednesday morning's weekly cabinet meeting but was tight-lipped on the scope of the rejig. 
Hours before the expected announcement, Sports Minister Laura Flessel said she was resigning from the government for personal reasons.
""I will continue to be a faithful team mate of the president and prime minister, whose determination I admire and whose values and patriotism I share,"" said Flessel, a former Olympic fencing champion and one of Macron's most popular ministers.
For much of Macron's first year in power, the former investment banker appeared untouchable, self-assured and unphased by his falling popularity as he pushed through investor-friendly reforms with a business-like efficiency.
Recently, however, Macron has looked more vulnerable.
Economic growth is slower than forecast, undermining his deficit-busting credentials. Usually decisive, he is wavering on an impending tax collection reform. Meanwhile, voters are growing impatient with his monarchical style and sharp tongue. 
""It wasn't supposed to happen to this president. He promised to be audacious in his reforms, efficient in the exercise of power, and the embodiment of dignity. In his first few months the promise was kept, but now everything is going wrong,"" the right-leaning Le Figaro said in an editorial on Monday.
""YEAR ZERO""
Macron has sold its pro-business reform drive on promises that it will boost growth and jobs, but voters spanning typically conservative pensioners to low-income workers complain the president's policies favor big business and the wealthy. 
Next up for his centrist government is tackling social spending -- a delicate political balancing act as he seeks to restore credibility with left-leaning voters -- just as weaker-than-forecast growth puts pressure on the budget deficit and his popularity plumbs new lows.
Macron's election victory, which blew apart France's mainstream parties and halted the march of the far-right National Front party, delighted French business and urban, liberal voters.
But prone to haughty and at times condescending remarks, he has struggled to connect with common folk. 
An IFOP-Fiducial opinion poll on Tuesday showed just 31 percent of respondents were happy with his performance as support eroded across all ages on both the political left and right. 
That is lower than his predecessor Francois Hollande at the same stage in the socialist's presidency. Hollande went on to become so unpopular he was the first president in France's Fifth Republic not to run for re-election. 
""It's something of a 'year zero' for Emmanuel Macron. The slate is being wiped clean, even his popularity is starting at zero again. Everything has to be rebuilt,"" said Philippe Moreau Chevrolet of the Sciences Po political school in Paris.
In a rare moment of humility, Macron on Monday acknowledged the challenges of his job to a class of young school students: ""There are some days which are easy, and others which are not.""

Jannati is the head of the Assembly of Experts, an influential body that can select and dismiss the supreme leader, the highest authority in Iran. 
Last week, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Tehran should be ready to negotiate on its future nuclear plans, its ballistic missile arsenal and its role in wars in Syria and Yemen. Iran's foreign ministry rejected the idea.
President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers in May and is re-imposing sanctions on Tehran. The other parties to the accord - China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany- are trying to find ways to save the agreement.
""Europe has announced that they won’t leave the deal,"" Jannati said, according to IRNA. ""In practice, by bringing up a discussion of missiles and other issues they are not following an appropriate path.""
Last month, the European Union decided to provide 18 million euros ($21 million) in aid to Iran to offset the impact of U.S. sanctions, part of efforts to salvage the deal.
Separately, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani suggested that the United States is trying pressure Iran through sanctions, though he did not explicitly name the United States.

""The enemy says 'I want an Iran that's in my control, that's in my fist,'"" Rouhani said in a speech broadcast on state TV. ""This is impossible...They want to pull us back 40 years, to surrender.""

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has sworn to recapture every inch of Syria and has made big gains against rebels since Russia joined his war effort in 2015. 
Last week, a source close to Damascus said the government was preparing a phased offensive to recover Idlib province, but Turkey, whose army has a string of observation posts around the edge of the rebel area, has warned against such an assault. 
Russian air raids ceased in and around Idlib on August 15, but pro-Syrian government forces have maintained an aerial bombardment and shelling against rebels there, the war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said. 
The rebel source and the Observatory both said the air strikes were in the countryside near Jisr al-Shughour on the western edge of the rebels' northwestern territory. 
Russian, Turkish and Iranian leaders are due to meet on Sept. 7 in Iran and are expected to discuss the situation in northwestern Syria.

BASRA, Iraq (Reuters) - A protester has died and six more were wounded in clashes with security forces in Iraq's southern oil hub Basra on Monday night, local health and security sources said.
Protesters threw petrol bombs cocktails and stones at security forces, who responded by firing shots into the air and tear gas, security sources said.
Hundreds of people had gathered near Basra's provincial government headquarters to press demands for better public services and an end corruption. The crowd averaged about 600-700 people at its peak, but thinned throughout the night.
Health sources said six protesters were taken to hospitals after sustaining injuries during the protests.
The local head of Iraq's Human Rights Commission, Mahdi al-Tamimi, called for an immediate investigation into the protester's death.
""We call on the Iraqi judiciary to open an immediate and urgent investigation into the killing of a demonstrator who was shot in the shoulder and subjected to electric shocks by security forces,"" Tamimi said in a statement.
Protests have swept cities in the long neglected south, Iraq's Shi'ite Muslim heartland, over electricity outages during the hot Iraqi summer, a lack of jobs and proper government services, and entrenched graft.
Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi suspended the electricity minister last month and said on Monday that his government had begun punishing those responsible for poor services in Basra, Iraq's second biggest city.
But public anger has swelled at a time when politicians are struggling to form a new government after an inconclusive parliamentary election in May. Iraq's top Shi'ite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani has expressed support for the protests.
On Friday, hundreds of protesters clashed with security forces in Basra as they tried to break into the provincial government headquarters.

Tweeting about her reason for leaving the stage in Jerusalem, Lewinsky wrote: ""There were clear parameters about what we would be discussing and what we would not.
""In fact, the exact question the interviewer asked first, she had put to me when we met the day prior. I said that was off limits ... I left because it is more important than ever for women to stand up for themselves and not allow others to control their narrative.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan issued evacuation advisories for more than 1 million people and canceled hundreds of flights in the face of extremely strong winds and heavy rain as typhoon Jebi made landfall along its west central coast on Tuesday.
Jebi - whose name means ""swallow"" in Korean - was briefly a super typhoon and is the latest harsh weather to hit Japan this summer following rains, landslides, floods and record-breaking heat that killed hundreds of people. There were scattered reports of mild injuries as the typhoon made landfall.
Tides in some areas were the highest since a typhoon in 1961, NHK public television said, with flooding covering the runways at Kansai International Airport in Osaka.
(Graphic: Japan Typhoon IMG - https://tmsnrt.rs/2N6Eudz)
The strong winds sent a 2,591-tonne tanker crashing into a bridge connecting Kansai airport, which is built on a man-made island in a bay, to the mainland. The bridge was damaged but the tanker was empty and none of its crew was injured, the coast guard said.
The storm made landfall on Shikoku, the smallest main island, around noon. It raked across the western part of the largest main island, Honshu, near the city of Kobe, several hours later, heading rapidly north. 
Evacuation advisories were issued for more than 1 million people as the wind and rain began picking up, the Fire and Disaster Management Agency said. Wind gusts of up to 208 km/h (129 mph) were recorded in one part of Shikoku, with forecasts for gusts as high as 216 km/h (135 mph).
""Our house is right at the base of a mountain, so it's a little dangerous and we decided to leave,"" one woman told NHK.
Television footage showed waves pounding the coastline, sheet metal tumbling across a parking lot and a truck turned on its side. People in Kobe reported on Twitter that the wind was shaking their apartment buildings and ripping branches off trees.
Around 100 mm (3.9 inches) of rain drenched one part of the tourist city of Kyoto in an hour, with as much as 500 mm (20 inches) set to fall in some areas in the 24 hours to noon on Wednesday.
Video posted on Twitter showed a small part of the roof of Kyoto train station falling to the ground.
More than 700 flights were canceled, along with scores of ferries and trains, NHK said. Shinkansen bullet train services between Tokyo and Hiroshima were suspended and Universal Studios Japan, a popular amusement park near Osaka, was closed.
Some 177,000 customers across western Japan lost power, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said. Toyota Motor Corp said it was cancelling the night shift at 14 plants.
The capital, Tokyo, will be far from the center of the storm but was set for heavy rains and high winds by the end of Tuesday.

Jebi's course has brought it close to parts of western Japan hit by rains and flooding that killed more than 200 people in July. However, it was set to speed up after making landfall, minimizing the amount of rain that will fall in one place.

210,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2018 04:41AM ET</span>","Philippines' Duterte scraps amnesty of chief critic, orders arrest","By Martin Petty and Neil Jerome Morales
MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday withdrew amnesty for an opposition senator involved in a failed coup 15 years ago and ordered his arrest, in what would be the second detention of a lawmaker critical of him.
Antonio Trillanes, Duterte's most vocal opponent, has accused him of hiding wealth, and has supported petitions to the International Criminal Court (ICC) seeking his indictment over the alleged murders of thousands of suspected criminals and drug dealers.
An executive order printed in the pro-Duterte Manila Times newspaper said clemency for the former military serviceman had been voided because he fell short of the minimum requirements, including admitting his guilt.
In 2010, then President Benigno Aquino gave Trillanes amnesty for involvement in a failed 2003 coup and a mutiny four years later, both aimed at overthrowing then-President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, a Duterte ally.
Trillanes called the executive order ""stupid"" and said he would not resist arrest or flee.
""It's a clear case of political persecution,"" he told reporters. ""Mr. Duterte is a dictator. He does not respect institutions. That is why we're like this: ordinary people are killed and critics are jailed.""
Trillanes is the latest of Duterte's detractors to be targeted, accused of offences opponents call trumped up or technicalities.
They include politicians, lawyers, a reporter, a judge, a United Nations rapporteur and even an elderly nun and a campaigner for indigenous peoples' rights. 
'MAXIMUM TOLERANCE'
Duterte, now on an official visit to Israel, has long maintained he has never penalized anyone for criticizing him.
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said Duterte had proven his ""maximum tolerance for freedom of expression"" and was simply enforcing the law by voiding an amnesty awarded as a political favor.
""It never was effective, there was nothing to undo,"" Roque told reporters in Jerusalem.
""He (Trillanes) did not ask for amnesty, it was given to him on a silver platter."" 
Trillanes' arrest would make him the second of a vocal Senate minority to be detained after Leila de Lima, a former justice secretary held for 18 months charged with involvement in illicit narcotics.
Both have targeted Duterte over his bloody war on drugs and have led Senate enquiries into his role in alleged executions by police, both while president and when a city mayor. Duterte denies wrongdoing.
The ICC in February started a preliminary examination of a complaint that accuses Duterte of crimes against humanity.
Legislative immunity did not cover Trillanes because of the seriousness of the alleged offences, which included rebellion and sedition, said Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra, adding that invalidating the amnesty was not a political move.
""This is not to scare anyone, but to ensure all of the laws are followed and obeyed,"" he told reporters.

Senator Risa Hontiveros said the action signaled ""Duterte's further slide into full authoritarian rule"".

Publishing the findings of her investigation into the February appointment of Martin Selmayr as secretary-general of the European Commission, Ombudsman Emily O'Reilly said on Tuesday that four instances of maladministration resulted from not following rules correctly, ""either in letter or in sprit"".
At issue were secrecy around the impending retirement of the outgoing secretary-general, an ""artificial urgency"" to fill the post that went unchallenged by Juncker's 27 fellow commissioners from member states and Selmayr's appointment as a deputy to his predecessor just minutes before being promoted to the top job.
The Ombudsman also criticized the Commission for ""defensive, evasive and at times combative"" responses to media questions on the arcane maneuvers around the publication of vacancies and selection of candidates which preceded an appointment that Juncker and his fellow commissioners were always free to make.
And she faulted other commissioners for failing to query why Juncker was rushing through a new job for his chief of staff.
The findings, accompanied by a recommendation to review the procedure for the appointment of the Commission's top official, does not annul the appointment of Selmayr, whose combative style has won the German both admirers and many enemies in Brussels.
But it reinforces damage to the EU executive's image after the European Parliament accused Juncker of a ""coup-like action"" just as backers of stronger EU institutions gear up to fight euroskeptics in elections next May to the EU legislature that will be held in the wake of Britain's exit.
""Our inquiry ... shows the precise steps the Commission took in order to make the appointment process appear normal,"" the Ombudsman said in a statement. 
""All of this risked jeopardising the hard won record of high EU administrative standards and consequently, the public trust.""
Juncker, a former premier of Luxembourg, will retire late next year and government leaders and Parliament will oversee the appointment of a new Commission for the next five-year mandate. 

As a civil servant, Selmayr would be expected to retain his role running the 30,000-strong administration in Brussels during a transition but could be replaced under Juncker's successor.

Travert said he had spoken to his British counterpart and that talks between the two sides were due on Wednesday after French vessels chased their rivals out of the Baie de Seine last week. 
British fishermen accused the French of ramming their vessels and hurling projectiles. Disgruntled French fishermen, unhappy that their British rivals can dredge for scallops year round while they are barred from doing so during summer months, said they came under a violent counter-attack.
""We can't keep going on like this, we can't keep having skirmishes like that,"" Travert said in an interview on CNews. ""The French Navy is ready to step in if more clashes break out, as well as carrying out checks.""
The row highlights problems between European member states over fishing rights, a subject that is likely to become increasingly sensitive as Britain negotiates its future trade relationship with the European Union.
Scallops - known as Coquille Saint Jacques in France - are one of just a few species whose catch is governed by national rather than European Union regulations.
France bans all scallop dredging between May 15 and Oct. 1, but Britain allows its vessels to operate year-round.
While British ships have no access to French territorial waters up to 12 nautical miles (22 km) off the coast, they can legally operate in the expansive Baie de Seine that stretches from Cherbourg to Dunkirk.
After the row - dubbed the Scallop Wars - flared up five years ago, French and British fishermen brokered yearly agreements that saw the British limit their scallop dredging in the Baie de Seine in exchange for some French scallop permits.
But those agreements have foundered in the past two years, French fishermen say, citing Britain's exit from the EU as a possible reason.

YANGON (Reuters) - Several Myanmar news outlets and dozens of civil society groups denounced the jailing of two Reuters reporters for seven years under the Official Secrets Act, and said their conviction was an assault on the right to freedom of information.
A court found the two journalists guilty on Monday in a landmark case seen as a test of progress toward democracy in Myanmar, which was ruled by a military junta until 2011.
Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, were investigating the killing of villagers from the Rohingya Muslim minority by security forces and civilians when they were arrested in December. They had pleaded not guilty.
Follow latest updates on detained reporters here  https://www.reuters.com/subjects/myanmar-reporters 
The privately owned 7 Day Daily, one of Myanmar's most widely read newspapers, printed a black block on its front page on Tuesday with an editorial headlined ""A sad day for Myanmar"".
The newspaper said the sentences ""end the hope that the current government will value and respect media freedom"", adding that the government had earned a reputation for oppressing the media, as previous military governments had done.
""Everyone needs to be aware that democracy will not survive in an information dark age,"" the newspaper said.
Myanmar abolished direct media censorship in 2012, as part of reforms by a quasi-civilian regime that led to elections in 2015 won by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's party.
Government spokesman Zaw Htay could not be reached for comment about the verdict either on Monday or Tuesday.
Deputy Information Minister Aung Hla Tun rejected the suggestion that the verdict was a blow to press freedom but acknowledged that some laws were ""not friendly"" to the media, including the Official Secrets Act under which the two reporters were convicted.
""This legislation was not enacted by this government, we inherited it,"" he told Reuters. ""We're trying to review the laws. Some will be abolished, if necessary, and some amended.""
An editor of the Irrawaddy online news magazine, Kyaw Zwa Moe, said Suu Kyi and President Win Myint had to understand the case was about the people’s right to know.
""There is nothing wrong in what these particular Reuters reporters did; like any journalists they were simply doing their jobs by attempting to gather information so as to uncover the truth,"" wrote Kyaw Zwa Moe, who was a political prisoner during military rule.
The privately owned Myanmar Times carried a full, front-page back-and-white photograph of Kyaw Soe Oo, in handcuffs and surrounded by reporters as he left the court, saying the verdict was a ""blow to press freedom"".
The state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper reported the facts of the verdict in four paragraphs on an inside page. It did not mention any criticism of the ruling but noted that the defense could appeal.
SET-UP
The conviction of the reporters comes amid mounting pressure on the government over the crackdown on the Rohingya in Rakhine State in west Myanmar. The crackdown was sparked by attacks by Rohingya insurgents on security forces in August 2017.
A U.N mandated fact-finding mission said last week that Myanmar's military carried out mass killings and gang rapes of Rohingya with ""genocidal intent"" and called for top generals to be prosecuted. Myanmar rejected the findings.
More than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled into Bangladesh since the crackdown was launched, according to U.N. agencies.
The two reporters had told the court two police officials handed them papers at a restaurant in the city of Yangon moments before other officers arrested them on Dec. 12.
One police witness testified the restaurant meeting was a set-up to entrap the journalists, who were reporting at the time on the massacre of 10 Rohingya Muslim men in Rakhine State. The judge said on Monday that testimony had not been corroborated by other witnesses.
During the hearings, a police officer had also told the court that he burned notes he made at the time of the reporters’ arrest, but didn’t explain why. Several prosecution witnesses contradicted the police account of where the arrests took place. And a police major conceded the ""secret"" information allegedly found on the reporters wasn’t actually a secret.
Zaw Htay, the government spokesman, has mostly declined comment on the proceedings in court.
Seventy-six civil society groups said in a joint message on Twitter that the trial ""was neither free nor fair and was completely manipulated"".
""We take this as a crackdown on the right of access to information and media freedom, and an oppressive gesture on all concerned people of Myanmar who are aspiring and building for a society characterised by rule of law, accountability, freedom and justice,"" the groups said in the English-language statement.
The conviction of the two reporters drew condemnation from the United Nations, many Western governments including the United States, Britain and France, and international organizations.
Several diplomats said it raised questions about Myanmar's transition towards democracy after nearly 50 years of harsh military rule, and about the commitment to human rights of the government led by Suu Kyi.
The information minister in the quasi-civilian administration that ruled until Suu Kyi's election win said the verdict would damage the government’s reputation.
""If you arrest and punish the journalists who are doing their job in Rakhine it means you have something to hide,"" Ye Htut, who also served as presidential spokesman in the previous administration, told Reuters.
Now a visiting senior fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore, Ye Htut said he had been criticized in Myanmar for a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post likening the prosecution of the journalists to events in Nazi Germany.
""The people tried to look the other way, to pretend there’s nothing happening,"" he said. 

""If you start to try to cover up one thing, that will lead to another.""

WELLINGTON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Police in the South Pacific island of Nauru briefly held a New Zealand journalist at a police station and canceled her permit to cover a regional leaders' conference on Tuesday, because she met refugees without seeking permission, the government and broadcaster TVNZ said.
Nauru closely controls access for foreign journalists and is particularly sensitive regarding asylum seekers sent there by Australia. It has already banned Australia's public broadcaster from sending reporters to the island after critical coverage.
Under Australia's hard line immigration policy anyone attempting to reach Australia by sea is sent for processing to camps on Nauru and Papua New Guinea's Manus Island and is never allowed to settle in Australia. 
Television New Zealand (TVNZ) Pacific correspondent Barbara Dreaver said she was held by police for three hours after speaking to a refugee outside a restaurant.
""The police showed up and said I was breaching my visa conditions and I was taken to the police station,"" Dreaver said in a TVNZ interview.
""I think it probably shows that things are a wee bit sensitive here, in fact a lot sensitive,"" she said. 
Nauru's government said she ""voluntarily accompanied"" police to the station and was in breach of her visa conditions because she did not go through the ""proper channels"" to seek to report a story outside the meeting.
""This journalist did not follow procedures ... police and security agencies are genuinely concerned about safety and security risks should media take it upon themselves to enter refugee residential settlements where emotions are high,"" the government statement said.
Australia defends its policy of forcing asylum seekers who arrive by sea to Manus Island and Nauru, saying it has deterred people from making dangerous journeys after thousands had drowned during ill-fated voyages in small boats.
Australia has negotiated for the United States to resettle some 1,250 refugees, including from Nauru. But resettlements have been slow, the vetting process sensitive and Nauru's hosting of the Pacific Islands Forum this week has thrown fresh scrutiny on to the situation.
Nauru suspended its typical A$8,000 fee ($5,777) for journalist visa applications during the Pacific Islands Forum meeting, but warned journalists against engaging ""in activities that cause or encourage disruption or civil unrest"".
The forum, attended by 18 member governments, comprising Pacific states plus Australia and New Zealand, runs until September 6.

The talks in the Thai capital come ahead of a gathering in Katowice, Poland in December, when government ministers will meet to agree rules for the 2015 Paris climate accord.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who in the past has described climate change as a hoax, pulled the United States out of the Paris Agreement in 2017, saying it favored other countries and was disadvantageous to the United States.
The Paris Agreement set a sweeping goal of ending the fossil fuel era this century, but the text was vague on details. 
Bainimarama, who is also president of the COP23 or 23rd annual Conference of the Parties to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, said that without guidelines countries ""risk chaos at Katowice and the possibility of yet another delay in the urgent work of combating climate change."" 
""In three months' time we will be in Katowice, and frankly, we are not ready. I don't think that statement should surprise anyone in this room,"" he said in an opening statement. 
After failing to make enough progress in Bonn in May, the Bangkok summit is seen as a last shot before Katowice. 
""This is not just an additional session. It is an urgent session,"" Bainimarama said. 
""Would any of us like to return to our people and tell them that we had the chance to do something truly great and truly necessary for the world we will pass to our children, but that we lacked the will to get it done?"" he asked. 
""Around our world the affects of climate change are becoming more evident and more severe. No country or region is spared and the effects in one region are felt in others,"" he added. 
He urged delegates to come up with clear guidelines. 
On Sunday, Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), told Reuters governments are not on track to meet a goal of the Paris agreement of capping temperatures well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) before the end of the century. 
Espinosa said she hopes a draft text for negotiation on the ""rule book' of the 2015 agreement will emerge at the end of the week-long Bangkok talks.

219,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2018 11:13PM ET</span>",Venezuelan leaders say migration flows are 'normal',"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's government said on Monday migratory patterns out of the OPEC nation are ""normal"" and that the situation was being exaggerated to justify an intervention by foreign powers. 
The United Nation's migration agency said last month the exodus of citizens out of Venezuela, which is suffering a hyperflationary economic collapse, is nearing a ""crisis moment"" comparable to the situation of refugees in the Mediterranean.
""There has been an intent to convert a normal migratory flow into a humanitarian crisis in order to justify an international intervention in Venezuela,"" Vice President Delcy Rodriguez told a news conference. ""We will not allow it."" 
She criticized foreign agencies for relying on figures of Venezuelan emigration provided by other countries but did not provide Venezuela's own figures. 
The U.N. migration and refugees organizations said in a joint statement in August 2.3 million Venezuelans are currently living abroad and that more than 1.6 million have left since 2015.
President Nicolas Maduro said in a televised broadcast on Monday night opposition street protests and U.S. financial sanctions had led some Venezuelans to ""try their luck"" in other countries but many were reconsidering that decision. 
""More than 90 percent are regretting it, of this group that isn't more than 600,000 Venezuelans who have left the country in the last two years, according to confirmed, certified serious figures,"" he said, without offering details. 
Images of Venezuelans leaving the country on foot through Colombia to escape hyperinflation and food shortages have sent alarm bells through the region as countries such as Ecuador, Peru and Chile seek to prepare for the growing flow of migrants. 
Venezuelan officials have described such scenes as having been staged by the media and political adversaries to tarnish Maduro's government.
The government announced last month it had repatriated 89 Venezuelans from Peru after they complained of being humiliated.
Migration officials from countries around South America began a two-day meeting in the Ecuadorean capital, Quito, on Monday to discuss regional strategies for managing the influx of migrants, with conclusions to be announced on Tuesday.

Colombia, Peru and Ecuador asked on Thursday for international aid to manage the migration surge that is overwhelming public services.

220,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2018 09:31PM ET</span>","Thai king's yellow and blue volunteers boost his support, visibility","By Panu Wongcha-um and Panarat Thepgumpanat
BANGKOK (Reuters) - From a distance, the volunteers cleaning up a clogged Bangkok waterway could be mistaken for Scouts, but the group, wearing yellow foulards and blue hats, are part of a volunteer program started by Thai King Maha Vajiralongkorn, 66.
The ""Volunteer Spirit"" scheme, which officially began in 2017, has created a new army of civilians who have pledged allegiance to the king and are boosting the image of Vajiralongkorn ahead of his formal coronation at year-end.
Vajiralongkorn's father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, was revered by Thais during his seven decades on the throne and the deep relationship between the monarchy and the military helped facilitate a smooth royal transition following his death in October 2016.
Since then, the new king has brought about a major shake-up of royal affairs, and some observers have said he may be seeking to distance himself from the military, which has been in power in Thailand since a 2014 coup.
Last year, Vajiralongkorn demanded unprecedented changes to a constitutional draft endorsed by the military government. He has also taken back control of royal assets formally managed by the government.
David Streckfuss, a Thailand-based independent scholar said he saw the volunteer program as an attempt by the king to create a separate power base.
""If the monarchy is ... to distinguish itself from the military and attempt to bring Thailand into a democratic constitutional monarchy, then we might look at this effort by the new monarch as creating an alternative power base,"" Streckfuss told Reuters.
The palace declined comment.
Vajiralongkorn however is thought to have a good working relationship with Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who came to power following the 2014 coup.
Thamontip Puangkitja, a 50-year-old retiree turned volunteer, said the volunteer program benefits the royal household.
""It is good for society and the revered royal institution,"" Thamontip said as she picked up rubbish in Bangkok.
""I joined the program because I wanted to do good for the king,"" said another volunteer, Patcharaporn Husain, 61, a housewife.
More than 4 million volunteers from all walks of life have joined the scheme, according to officials in charge. They carry out a range of tasks from cleaning public spaces to helping police to direct traffic. 
Their most high-profile moment was came when the volunteers joined an international rescue effort to rescue 12 boys and their soccer coach from a flooded cave last month.
""We fed about four thousand people every day at the cave,"" a palace official who was involved with the rescue told Reuters.
He declined to be named.
NEW TRADITION
Volunteers have to register with the palace and go through an initiation process that involves lining up and bowing in front of the king's portrait before being given their yellow and blue uniforms - colors associated with former King Bhumibol and Queen Mother Sirikit, Vajiralongkorn's mother.
Once they put on their new uniforms, the volunteers do a military-style salute to the king's portrait and, in a completely new tradition, they must line up and salute the king's portrait every time before starting a community activity.
Some say the program reflects the mindset of King Vajiralongkorn who sees the Victorian-era court of King Vajiravudh, also known as Rama VI, as the ideal model of kingship.
""The king wants the volunteers to be a kind of 'Sue Pa',"" Sulak Sivaraksa, a renowned scholar who has sometimes been a critic of the monarchy, told Reuters, referring to the Wild Tiger Corps – a paramilitary force founded in 1911 by Vajiravudh that was inspired by the British Volunteer Force.
He ""wants the monarchy to serve the people, to protect the people, to do well for the people,"" said Sulak, 86.
The volunteer force raised by Vajiralongkorn is not armed.
Bhumibol was patron to hundreds of foundations spread across Thailand, but no such volunteer program existed during his reign.
The volunteers are able to do things that the government might otherwise not be able to, because of their royal backing, said Sulak.
""If the government asked them they wouldn't do it,"" said Sulak.

""The volunteer program is one of the great successes of the new king.""

221,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2018 08:28PM ET</span>",Myanmar court jails Reuters reporters for seven years in landmark secrets case,"By Shoon Naing and Aye Min Thant
YANGON (Reuters) - A Myanmar judge on Monday found two Reuters journalists guilty of breaching a law on state secrets and jailed them for seven years, in a landmark case seen as a test of progress toward democracy in the Southeast Asian country.
    Yangon northern district judge Ye Lwin said Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, breached the colonial-era Official Secrets Act when they collected and obtained confidential documents.
""The defendants ... have breached Official Secrets Act section 3.1.c, and are sentenced to seven years,"" the judge said, adding that the time served since they were detained on Dec. 12 would be taken into account. The defense can appeal the decision to a regional court and then the supreme court.
The verdict comes amid mounting pressure on the government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi over a security crackdown sparked by attacks by Rohingya Muslim insurgents on security forces in Rakhine State in west Myanmar in August 2017.
More than 700,000 stateless Rohingya Muslims have fled into Bangladesh since then, according to U.N. agencies.
The two reporters, who were investigating the killing by the security forces of Rohingya villagers at the time of their arrest, had pleaded not guilty.
Press freedom advocates, the United Nations, the European Union and countries including the United States, Canada and Australia had called for the journalists' acquittal.
""Today is a sad day for Myanmar, Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, and the press everywhere,"" Reuters editor in chief Stephen J Adler said in a statement. 
""We will not wait while Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo suffer this injustice and will evaluate how to proceed in the coming days, including whether to seek relief in an international forum.""
United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres has urged Myanmar authorities to review their decision, his spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement on Monday. 
""It is unacceptable that these journalists were prosecuted for reporting on major human rights violations against the Rohingya in Rakhine State,"" he said, adding that Guterres would continue to advocate for their release and for ""full respect of freedom of the press and all human rights in Myanmar."" 
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley called for the immediate, unconditional release of the reporters. 
""It is clear to all that the Burmese military has committed vast atrocities,"" Haley said in a statement. 
""In a free country, it is the duty of a responsible press to keep people informed and hold leaders accountable. The conviction of two journalists for doing their job is another terrible stain on the Burmese government."" 
The reporters had told the court two police officials handed them papers at a restaurant in the city of Yangon moments before other officers arrested them.
One police witness testified the restaurant meeting was a set-up to entrap the journalists to block or punish them for their reporting of a mass killing of Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine.
More than 80 people, including senior diplomats, were packed into the court on Monday. 
Judge Ye Lwin read a summary of witness testimony for about an hour before delivering his verdict, which had been postponed by a week because he was sick.
The court determined that ""confidential documents"" found on the two would have been useful ""to enemies of the state and terrorist organizations"". Documents in their possession and on their phones were ""not public information"", he said.
'NO FEAR'
Kyaw Soe Oo's wife, Chit Su Win, burst into tears after the verdict, and family members had to support her as she left the court.
Wa Lone, in handcuffs and flanked by police, told a cluster of friends and reporters after the verdict not to worry. 
""We know we did nothing wrong. I have no fear. I believe in justice, democracy and freedom,"" he said.
Kyaw Soe Oo also said the reporters had committed no crime and that they would maintain their fight for press freedom.
""What I want to say to the government is: you can put us in jail, but do not close the eyes and ears of the people,"" he said.
Some of the reporters' supporters shouted ""let them speak"" and jostled with police as they were driven back to prison.
Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo both have young daughters and have not seen their families outside of prison visits and court hearings for nearly nine months.
Kyaw Soe Oo has a three-year-old daughter and Wa Lone's wife, Pan Ei Mon, gave birth to their first child last month.
Government spokesman Zaw Htay didn't respond to requests for comment about the verdict. He has mostly declined to comment throughout the proceedings, saying the courts were independent and the case would be conducted according to the law.
'HAMMER BLOW'
U.S. ambassador Scot Marciel said the ""deeply troubling"" verdict could undermine the confidence the Myanmar people had in the justice system.
""Unbelievable! More and more, responsible journalism is found to be a crime in Myanmar!"" Yanghee Lee, U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, said on Twitter.
The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, said the verdict ""sends a message to all journalists in Myanmar that they cannot operate fearlessly, but must rather make a choice to either self-censor or risk prosecution.""
British ambassador Dan Chugg, speaking on behalf of EU members, said the verdict had ""dealt a hammer blow for the rule of law"".
France said it deplored `the prison sentences and that the convictions represented a serious violation of press freedom and the rule of law.
Ed Royce, Republican chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, called for more U.S. sanctions in addition to targeted measures already imposed on a handful of Myanmar military and police commanders.
""This unjust verdict reaffirms that the Burmese government is complicit in the military’s atrocities,"" he said in a statement. ""The U.S. should respond with more sanctions and a formal determination of genocide. We must act before it is too late.”
In Bangladesh, Iqbal Sobhan Chowdhury, a media adviser to the prime minister, said it was ""an open secret"" that anyone exposing ""atrocities of the Myanmar army"" would be persecuted.
Marianne Hagen, deputy foreign minister of Norway, whose state-controlled firm Telenor is the second largest mobile phone operator in Myanmar, urged the authorities to ""protect freedom of the press, respect basic human rights and secure journalists' rights in the court system"". 
Reuters called the Myanmar military spokesman but an assistant said the spokesman was busy and unable to speak.
INVESTIGATING KILLINGS
The reporters were arrested on Dec. 12 while investigating the killing of 10 Rohingya men and boys and other abuses involving soldiers and police in Inn Din, a village in Rakhine State.
Myanmar has denied allegations of atrocities made by refugees against its security forces, saying it conducted a legitimate counterinsurgency operation against Muslim militants.
But the military acknowledged the killing of the 10 Rohingya at Inn Din after arresting the Reuters reporters.
A U.N mandated fact-finding mission said last week that Myanmar's military carried out mass killings and gang rapes of Muslim Rohingya with ""genocidal intent"" and called for top generals to be prosecuted. Myanmar rejected the findings.

The International Criminal Court is considering whether it has jurisdiction over events in Rakhine, while the United States, the European Union and Canada have sanctioned Myanmar military and police officers over the crackdown.

222,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2018 06:39PM ET</span>",Philippines' Duterte says 'never again' at Israel's Holocaust memorial,"By Ori Lewis
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, who once likened his crime-fighting policy to Hitler's mass murders and then apologized for the comparison, on Monday laid a wreath to commemorate the Holocaust dead in Jerusalem.
During his visit to Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust memorial and museum, Duterte stood alongside his daughter, Sara, whom he fathered with Elizabeth Abellana Zimmerman, his Jewish first wife, which by religious tradition makes Sara Jewish too. 
In a solemn ceremony, he kindled the eternal flame in the Hall of Remembrance and laid a wreath. 
Reading from what he wrote in the visitors' book after the ceremony, Duterte said: ""Never again.""
""May the world learn the lesson of this horrific and benighted period of human history. May the hearts of peoples around the world remain ever open. And may the minds of all men and women learn to work together towards providing a safe haven for all who are being persecuted.""
In 2016, in a reference to an opponent's remark that his rise could be like that of Adolf Hitler, Duterte said he himself would be ""happy to slaughter"" drug addicts in a similar way to the Nazi leader's mass murder of Jews.
Duterte is paying an official four-day visit to Israel, the first by a Philippines president, and officials on both sides have tried to play down his record of jarring invective.
Israel's Government Press Office said most of the visit would be closed to the media, an apparent precaution against any faux pas by a president whose two-fisted crime-fighting tactics and rhetoric have raised hackles at home and abroad. 
Tourism, labor and defense deals were signed earlier when Duterte met Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in his office.
""PASSION FOR PEACE""
""We share the same passion for peace. We share the same passion for human beings. But we also share the same passion of not allowing a family to be destroyed by those who (have) corrupt ideologies,"" Duterte said, in an apparent reference to drug dealers.
Duterte has apologized for likening his war on drug dealers with the Holocaust but he has been dogged by accusations from activists that thousands of killings in his ongoing war on drugs were executions, accusations he rejects. He has also been rebuked by women's groups for remarks that make light of rape. 
In June, Duterte called God “stupid” and he has lashed out repeatedly at the Catholic church, calling it hypocritical. His visit will include sightseeing in Jerusalem's walled Old City, which houses major Christian, Jewish and Muslim shrines.
After arriving in Israel on Sunday, Duterte met with hundreds of Filipinos living in the country who work mainly as care-givers and received a rousing reception, Israeli media said. Between 24,000 and 28,000 work as carers for the elderly.
Netanyahu, in his remarks, said his own father had been looked after by a Filipina care-giver and that after he died at age 102, his uncle had benefitted from the care of the same worker.
""I, like many, many Israeli families, am deeply moved by this show of humanity,"" Netanyahu said.

On Wednesday, Duterte departs for neighboring Jordan.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A blind woman said an Uber [UBER.UL] driver abruptly left her on the side of a Rio de Janeiro street last week after loudly berating her over her request that he turn down the car's air conditioning, the latest safety incident involving the ride-hailing firm. 
Nathalia Santos, 26, a Rio native who runs a popular YouTube channel about her life as a blind woman, said she was unable to ascertain her location after being expelled from the car or get to her destination. 
""He stopped the car, started shouting at me and said blindness was my punishment,"" she wrote on Instagram about Thursday's incident, which highlighted concerns over Uber's training and vetting of drivers, particularly with regard to conduct toward passengers with disabilities.
Uber said the driver has been permanently banned from working for it. 
""Uber considers this behavior to be unacceptable,"" the company said in a statement. ""We regret the whole incident and have already been in touch with the rider.""
The driver's identity has not been made public. 
The incident comes at a time when Uber is spending resources on security, having pledged $60 million to open a safety center in Sao Paulo after a series of incidents in which both passengers and occasionally drivers were harmed or threatened. 
Brazil is profitable for Uber, unlike the company as a whole, and is its second-largest market after the United States.
Santos said Uber had called to apologize, but had not offered any monetary compensation. 
In Latin America, users in several Mexican cities and in Montevideo, Uruguay can request drivers who have received special training for people with disabilities, but those services are unavailable in the rest of the region.
""It's never been easier for the elderly or for people with disabilities to use Uber,"" reads Uber's Brazilian website. But it offers no specific resources. 
Santos said on Monday she did not think what happened to her was an isolated incident. 
""I've been receiving many messages from people like me who say they have suffered through similar experiences,"" she told Reuters, ""such as drivers who aren't cordial or sympathetic, when it's precisely due to the hostilities of public transportation that people use the app."" 

She said she no longer uses Uber, and is relying on her family for transportation.

(Reuters) - Tropical Storm Gordon whipped the southern tip of Florida with high winds and rain on Monday, and was expected to have strengthened into a hurricane by the time it makes landfall along the central U.S. Gulf Coast on Tuesday night, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.
The storm was forecast to come ashore late on Tuesday near the border between Louisiana and Mississippi, and drop as much as 8 inches (20 cm) of rain in some areas of the U.S. South still reeling from hurricanes a year ago.
Gordon was generating winds of 50 miles per hour (80 km per hour) on Monday as it steamed west-northwest at 16 mph (27 kph), the National Hurricane Center said.
As the storm crossed Florida's southern tip on Monday morning, officials closed the beaches in Miami-Dade County and warned of possible street flooding.
By Monday afternoon the storm had passed over the state. There were no reports of any injuries or deaths or any damages to buildings, said Alberto Moscoso, a spokesman for the Florida Division of Emergency Management.
Last year, powerful hurricanes walloped Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, causing thousands of deaths, hundreds of billions of dollars worth of damage, massive power outages and devastation to hundreds of thousands of structures.
At the mouth of the Mississippi River, around the area of New Orleans, the storm could generate a surge of up to 4 feet(1.2 meters) and smaller surges could hit coastland along other parts of the Gulf Coast, Graham said.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said on Sunday he had activated the state's Crisis Action Team as a precaution.
U.S. oil producer Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC) on Monday evacuated workers and shut production at two offshore oil platforms, and other companies with production and refining operations along the Gulf Coast said they were securing facilities. 

The U.S. Coast Guard also warned that the ports of New Orleans as well as Gulfport and Pascagoula, Mississippi, may have to close within 48 hours when gale force winds from Gordon are expected to arrive.

LJUBLJANA (Reuters) - Slovenian President Borut Pahor expressed his concern on Monday after internet footage showed masked members of an armed group led by a fringe politician conducting training exercises.
Former presidential candidate Andrej Sisko told Reuters that his group would secure order if necessary, adding that it was doing nothing illegal - although he acknowledged that the weapons it uses have not been registered with the Slovenian authorities.
The president said there was no place for such a group in the European Union member state. ""President Pahor stresses that Slovenia is a safe country in which no unauthorized person needs or is allowed to ... illegally care for the security of the country and its borders,"" Pahor's cabinet said in a statement.
Photos on websites and in local media show up to 50 masked people with guns led by an unmasked Sisko, who won only 2.2 percent of the vote when he ran for president last year.
Sisko said the group called the ""Guard of Stajerska"", named after a region of northeastern Slovenia, consists of ""several hundred people"", adding that these were volunteers who ""will secure public peace and order"" if needed. 
""The police have not visited me so far but I expect their visit. We are doing nothing wrong and we would be even interested in cooperating with the police,"" Sisko said.
The police said the force had started an investigation into the matter.
Sisko also attacked multiculturalism, saying the country should accept immigrants only if they accept Slovenian culture.
He also leads the center-right United Slovenia Movement, which got 0.6 percent of the vote in a June general election and failed to make it to parliament. The party has no connection to the military group, he said.
Anti-immigrant sentiment has increased in Slovenia since 2015 and 2016 when almost half a million migrants crossed the country on their way to richer EU states.
The number of requests for an asylum in Slovenia has risen significantly from 277 in the whole of 2015 to 1,717 so far this year. However, only 77 people have been granted an asylum in 2018 versus 152 in the whole of 2017, interior ministry data showed.
An anti-immigrant stand helped the center-right Slovenian Democratic Party to win most votes at the June election but the party lacked coalition partners to form a government.

As a consequence a minority government of five center-left parties is due to be confirmed in the parliament next week.

The constitutional court has not yet pronounced, however, on the most highly anticipated case -- former vice president and warlord Jean-Pierre Bemba's challenge to his exclusion from the race last month by the national electoral commission. 
The court is due to rule by Tuesday on Bemba's eligibility. Bemba, whose supporters battled state troops in the streets of the capital Kinshasa after he finished second to Kabila in the 2006 election, was excluded due to a witness tampering conviction at the International Criminal Court (ICC). 
In a judgment broadcast on national television, the constitutional court definitively invalidated the candidacy of Adolphe Muzito on technical grounds related to a dispute with his longtime party. Muzito served as Kabila's prime minister from 2008-2012. 
The court also overruled the electoral commission's decision last month to bar Samy Badibanga from the race on the grounds that he had previously forfeited his Congolese nationality. Badibanga was briefly prime minister in 2016 and 2017.
A rare public opinion poll by New York University's Congo Research Group in July found Muzito winning 5 percent of the vote, while Badibanga did not receive enough votes to be included in the results. 
Bemba placed third in the poll behind opposition leaders Felix Tshisekedi and Moise Katumbi. Tshisekedi's candidacy was validated last month by the electoral commission but Katumbi was barred from re-entering Congo to register after two years in exile. 
The Dec. 23 election is due to usher in Congo's first democratic transition of power after Kabila agreed last month to respect constitutional term limits and step aside in favor of close loyalist Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary's candidacy.
That announcement has calmed tensions that exploded into deadly street protests when Kabila refused to step aside at the end of his constitutional mandate in December 2016. 

But fears persist of further violence, especially if Bemba is prevented from running. He was unexpectedly able to return to Congo last month after his war crimes convictions for murders and rapes committed by his militia in neighboring Central African Republic were quashed by the ICC in May.

The man, identified by Dutch media as Jawed S., is a 19-year-old Afghan with residency in Germany, who traveled to Amsterdam to carry out an attack because of what he said were repeated insults to God, the Koran and Islam's Prophet Mohammed, prosecutors said in a statement.
The attack came after Wilders, a far right campaigner against Islam, canceled plans to hold a competition last week of cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed and had a clear ""terrorist motive"", prosecutors said.

The victims, both 38-year-old men, are still being treated in hospital, while the stabber, who was shot and wounded by police, was also being treated while his custody was extended for two weeks on Monday.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Former Chilean President Michelle Bachelet, who took the helm of the U.N. human rights office on Monday, will need a strong voice in confronting populists and crises marked by war crimes, activists said. 
Bachelet swiftly called on Myanmar to free two Reuters journalists convicted earlier in the day for their reporting on the crackdown on Rohingya.
Bachelet was chosen by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to succeed Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein of Jordan and the appointment was approved by the General Assembly last month.
She was tortured during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet but later rose to serve twice as Chile's president.
She inherits an inbox that includes conflicts in Yemen and Syria and crises in Venezuela and Nicaragua.
Just last week independent U.N. investigators said that six Myanmar generals should be prosecuted for ""genocidal intent"" and another expert panel said that some air strikes by the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen may amount to war crimes.
""This is an extraordinarily challenging time for human rights, given the rise of autocratic populists, the increasingly muscular hostility of China and Russia, the loss of the US and often the UK as voices for human rights, and a leadership void making possible a proliferation of atrocities in such places as Syria, Yemen, and Myanmar,"" Ken Roth, executive-director of Human Rights Watch, told Reuters.
But he said some governments and U.N. officials hope she will be ""quieter and more selective"" than Zeid who criticized governments in China, Israel, Russia and the United States.
The U.N. Human Rights Council, which opens a three-week session on Sept 10, is due to hold a debate on extending the mandate of its investigators on Yemen. It will also examine the next steps toward ensuring justice in Myanmar.
Zeid left a political hot potato after saying in January that his office had found 206 companies doing business linked to unlawful Israeli settlements in the West Bank and urging them to avoid any complicity in ""pervasive"" violations against Palestinians. His report did not name the companies and said that its database was not yet complete.
""The immediate test she has got in terms of taking on the Council is the settlements database,"" Roth said, saying that Bachelet should not delay publication of the list.
Another activist group, UN Watch, said last month that Bachelet has ""a controversial record when it comes to her support for the human rights abusing governments who rule Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, and we need to know how she plans to address these urgent situations.""

Zeid, asked last week his advice to Bachelet, told reporters: ""To very much continue along the same trajectory.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The new head of Britain's white-collar crime agency pledged on Monday to keep it independent, but work more closely with international enforcement watchdogs and the private sector to stop fraud, drawing on her experience with the FBI.
Former U.S. federal prosecutor Lisa Osofsky was named director of Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) in June, saying she wanted to embolden an agency whose future has been in doubt.
She took up the reins last week and on Monday sought to reassure lawyers that the SFO has a standalone future.
""I started a five-year term with the Attorney General's support and commitment to maintaining the independence and prominence of this organization,"" Osofsky said in her first speech.
A dual U.S.-British national, Osofsky joins from Exiger, a financial crime compliance company. Before that she prosecuted more than 100 cases for the U.S. government.
Lawyers reacted furiously last year to now dropped plans from Britain's ruling Conservative Party to fold the agency into the National Crime Agency after a series of high-profile setbacks.
There were also questions about how the SFO would fit in with the planned National Economic Crime Centre (NECC). Osofsky said the SFO will be seconding staff to the new center.
Christopher David, counsel in WilmerHale's UK white collar practice, said Osofsky has firmly dismissed the suggestion that she has previously supported folding the SFO into the NCA.
Under her predecessor David Green, the agency was praised by politicians for securing deferred prosecution agreements, or DPAs, with Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) and  Tesco  (LON:TSCO), and yielding combined fines of around 630 million pounds.
Osofsky said working with the newcomers to DPAs, such as Argentina, Canada and Australia would be a priority for her, but companies seeking a DPA must show efforts to ""clean up the house"".
She also wanted to cooperate with a range of stakeholders to make use of ""new ideas and approaches that are out there"".
""While much of it is familiar territory, there are some interesting new ideas, including deliberate references to the enforcement methods used by the U.S. authorities and the suggestion that similar methods can be used in the UK,"" WilmerHale's David said.
Osofsky said Britain's revenue and customs department is a ""natural ally"" to build strong cases, and recouping proceeds of crime was also a priority.
Technology companies needed to work with the SFO to help it access encrypted data, she said.
In April this year, the SFO said its core funding would rise by around 50 percent this year, helping it to take on bigger cases.

(Reuters) - Divers searching the Colorado River in Arizona on Monday found the body of a woman who died after two boats slammed head-on into each other, with three other people still missing from the collision, officials said.
In the crash on Saturday night, a boat with 10 people and a craft carrying six people struck each other and everyone aboard was thrown into the water near Arizona's border with California. The two boats sank. 
Several people were rescued by nearby boaters, the Mohave County Sheriff's Office said.
Nine people were injured, including two people who suffered critical injuries in the incident less than 15 miles (24 km) south of the California town of Needles, the sheriff's office said.
Divers resumed searching on Monday at sunrise for the four missing. They soon found the body of one of four missing boaters, 51-year-old Christi Lewis of California, Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anita Mortensen said by phone.

The divers were continuing to look for one man and two women, she said.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - A Cambodian political analyst said on Monday he has fled the country after receiving threats since his release from a 1-1/2 year sentence for accusing Prime Minister Hun Sen's party of orchestrating the 2016 murder of government critic Kem Ley.
Kim Sok, who has a six-year-old daughter, was released on August 17 and since then has criticized Hun Sen's appointment to government of some leaders of parties that participated but won no seats in July 29 elections.
He told Reuters that on August 29 he received six anonymous calls in which he was told: ""'I know you have a daughter and if you don't stop talking, you must be careful.'""
""I and my daughter are seeking asylum in a third country,"" he said. ""Once my daughter is safe, I will go back to Cambodia and continue my advocacy,"" he added.
He declined to say where he had gone but said he had reported the threats to a U.S. embassy in Phnom Penh on August 30. The embassy declined to comment.
Tens of thousands protested the murder of prominent activist Kem Ley, many of whom said they suspected a political motive in his death. A man was jailed for life last year for the killing and testified that he killed Kem Ley over a debt.
Human rights groups and Kem Ley's supporters said they were skeptical of the convicted man's testimony. The family said the activist did not owe any money.
Hun Sen, whose Cambodian People's Party (CPP) swept all parliamentary seats in largely unopposed elections, said on August 29 that Kim Sok must pay a $200,000 court fine dating from his conviction or return to prison.
Phay Siphan, a spokesman for the Cambodian government, said Kim Sok was lying.

""This is his intention to do anything to get asylum abroad without having to care about truth and laws,"" Phay Siphan told Reuters. ""Like the prime minister has said, if you want to get asylum, just curse him,"" he said.

Lawmakers were supposed to elect the speaker and two deputies, at the start of a 90-day process outlined in the constitution.
But with competing political blocs each claiming to hold a parliamentary majority, no vote was held on the appointments. The temporary leader of the assembly said it would remain in session until Tuesday. 
The new cohort of Iraqi lawmakers was sworn in after a formal handover ceremony attended by the leaders of the main electoral blocs, including Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi who addressed the gathered MPs of the 329-seat body. 
On Sunday, lawmakers led by populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and Abadi announced they had managed to form an alliance that would give them a majority bloc in parliament. 
Hours later, a rival grouping led by militia commander Hadi al-Amiri and former Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki responded by saying it had formed its own alliance that would be the largest bloc, after it persuaded some lawmakers to defect from the rival group.
Amiri and Maliki are Iran's two most prominent allies in Iraq. Abadi is seen as the preferred candidate of the United States, while Sadr portrays himself as a nationalist who rejects both American and Iranian influence. 
Both groups continued to claim they held the majority on Monday, complicating the election of a speaker.

Iraqis voted in May in their first parliamentary election since the defeat of Islamic State's self-declared caliphate, but a contentious recount process delayed the announcement of final results until earlier this month.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The longer Donald Trump stays in office, the higher the risk that anti-American forces will gain the upper hand in Germany and push it into the arms of Russia and China, veteran German diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger said in an interview.
The chairman of the Munich Security Conference and former ambassador to Washington was speaking to Reuters days before the publication of his book ""World in Danger"", in which he urges Germans not to giving up on the United States because of Trump, while also pressing them to accept more global responsibility.
""The longer Trump remains in office, the harder it will be to stand up to those in this country and elsewhere in Europe who have been arguing since the Vietnam war that we need to cut the cord with America the bully,"" Ischinger said.
""It would become much harder for the German government to stay the course and defend this relationship,"" he said. ""And the forces calling for a closer relationship with countries like Russia or China might be emboldened.""
Since entering the White House in January last year, Trump has pulled the United States out of the Paris climate accord, left the Iran nuclear deal and threatened to withdraw from the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
He has repeatedly attacked Germany for its trade surplus and lack of defense spending, unsettling a country that has long viewed America as its closest ally outside of Europe and a bulwark of its security and defense.
A survey by the Pew Research Center last year indicated that only 35 percent of Germans have a favorable view of the United States under Trump. A poll by the Koerber Foundation suggested that Germans see Trump as a bigger foreign policy problem than authoritarian leaders in North Korea, Russia or Turkey.
""SERIOUS VIOLATION""
Against this backdrop, some German politicians are urging the government to seek closer ties with Moscow and Beijing - two authoritarian powers whose values diverge from the liberal democracy that Germany has built in the seven decades since it rose from the ashes of World War Two with American help. Chancellor Angela Merkel, a strong believer in the transatlantic relationship, has resisted.
Ischinger expressed particular concern about Trump's use of sanctions as a foreign policy tool, and his threat to punish German and other firms involved in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project with Russia.
""If U.S. sanctions are applied to prevent Nord Stream 2, the repercussions will be poisonous for the transatlantic relationship,"" he said.
""Even if you have doubts about the wisdom of Nord Stream 2, it is hard not to see this as a serious violation, as an instance of the U.S. forcing its views on the Europeans.""
Ischinger praised Merkel for spelling out the need for Germany to become more independent but said it was high time that her words were translated into action.
He estimated that the government would need to raise defense spending by 10-15 billion for the four-year legislative period, if it hopes to meet its most basic commitments.
""We're not where we should be. And you can even argue that we've taken a step backwards in recent years,"" Ischinger said.

""It's not enough to declare that we want to assume more responsibility. We need to show where the beef is, and that there is beef. There need to be budgetary consequences.""

235,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>",Protests over Yemen's economic malaise spread to other southern cities,"ADEN (Reuters) - Demonstrations spread to new parts of southern Yemen on Monday even as they eased slightly in the port city of Aden following government orders aimed at strengthening the local currency and reversing economic decline.
Protesters burned tires in order to cut roads in Aden's Sheikh Othman district, and many shops in other precincts remained closed after shuttering a day earlier, residents and witnesses said.
Dozens of demonstrators also marched, cut roads and closed markets in the provinces of Hadramout, Lahaj and Abyan, with some chanting ""Pay our salaries in dollars like you take yours in dollars"", a reference to officials living abroad amid a domestic currency crisis.
The Yemeni rial has lost more than half its value against the U.S. dollar since the start of a civil war in 2015 between the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, based in the south and backed by Saudi Arabia, and the Iran-aligned Houthi movement that controls the north including the capital, Sanaa.
Soaring prices have put some basic commodities out of reach for many Yemenis and the central bank has struggled to pay public-sector salaries on which many depend as foreign exchange reserves dwindle.
The rial plunged to about 500 to the dollar in January from 250 the year before. On Monday, bankers and currency traders in Aden said it had dropped further, reaching 620.
After demonstrations paralyzed Aden a day earlier, Hadi's government ordered a package of measures including a temporary halt on imports of luxury goods like automobiles and a 30 percent salary increase for public-sector employees, including pensioners and contractors.
The 73-year-old leader, who lives in exile in Riyadh and has suffered from a heart condition since 2011, then flew to the United States for medical care described as routine by state media.
Organizers have pledged to continue demonstrating until the current government resigns and prices for consumer goods are reduced.
Mohammed Qassim al-Nouman, head of the non-profit Yemen Center for Human Rights, said Hadi's directives failed to address the reasons for economic deterioration, which he ascribed to nepotism in official appointments and runaway state spending.
""They were only decisions designed to escape from treating the real (problems), notably the government's failure to fulfill the duties entrusted to it and its continued absence outside the country,"" he said.
Yemen is one of the poorest Arab countries and the war has pushed it toward humanitarian collapse as hunger and disease spread. The United Nations has convened talks in Geneva on Thursday, the first effort to negotiate the conflict in more than two years.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Eight people were shot at a San Bernardino, California apartment complex, including a 17-year-old boy who was in critical condition, police said on Monday.
Police in the Southern California city were unsure what motivated the shooting late on Sunday in an outdoor common area where a group of people had gathered, said San Bernardino police spokesman Captain Richard Lawhead. 
""Right now, nobody is cooperating and providing us with the information we need to help us locate a suspect or what led to the shooting or anything else,"" Lawhead said in a phone interview.
Two people, including the 17-year-old boy, were hospitalized in extremely critical condition, Lawhead said.
The conditions of the other six people were not immediately known. Victims were taken to three hospitals.
Police initially said 10 people had been hit by gunfire at the apartment complex, but Lawson later said a total of eight people had been shot. Police had initially received conflicting reports, he said.
The shooting happened during a hot holiday weekend in San Bernardino, a city of more than 216,000 residents about 60 miles (96 km) east of Los Angeles.
San Bernardino was the scene of a 2015 mass shooting in which a husband and wife killed 14 people and wounded 22 others before police shot the couple to death. The couple was inspired by Islamic extremists, authorities said.
There was no indication that Sunday's gunfire was in any way connected to the 2015 shooting.

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Mauritius tried to persuade judges at the World Court on Monday to find that it was illegally stripped by Britain of another Indian Ocean archipelago, the Chagos Islands, now home to a major U.S. air base.
The case at the International Court of Justice in the Hague is a test of whether colonial-era deals struck by great powers and small states that later gained independence are legitimate, given the power imbalance.
Britain in 1965 detached the Chagos Islands from its colony of Mauritius, which became independent three years later while the sparsely populated Chagos remained overseas British territory.
The United States has leased the Chagos Islands’ biggest island, Diego Garcia, since 1966 and has built an air base there, while the entire population of around 1,500 people was forced to leave.
In 2017, Mauritius petitioned the United Nations to seek an ICJ advisory opinion on the legality of Britain's colonial-era move.
Despite opposition from Britain and the United States, which views the Diego Garcia base as a vital military asset, the U.N. General Assembly referred the matter to the ICJ, commonly known as the World Court, in 2017 for an advisory opinion.
Although ICJ opinions are not binding, they carry weight under international law.
The case was argued by elder statesman Anerood Jugnauth, 88, who served for nearly 30 years during four stints as prime minister or president of Mauritius from 1982-2017, and now holds the post of ""minister mentor"" in a cabinet led by his son.
“The choice we were faced with was no choice at all: it was independence with detachment (of the Chagos archipelago) or no independence with detachment anyway,” Jugnauth told the 14-judge panel.
UK solicitor general Robert Buckland told the court it should decline to issue any opinion on the matter, which he argued was better suited to bilateral negotiations.
The people displaced from the Chagos Islands have lobbied for years to be able to return. In 2016, Britain's Foreign Ministry extended Diego Garcia's lease until 2036, and declared the expelled islanders would not be allowed to go back.
Outside the court in The Hague, a small group of Chagossians gathered to protest. They unfurled banners denouncing ""modern slavery"" and called for Chagossians to be allowed self-determination.
“I want the world to see that we are still suffering,"" Isabelle Charlot, whose father was born on Chagos, told Reuters. 
Buckland accepted that the removal of the Chagossians and their treatment thereafter ""was shameful and wrong"", but said it had already been resolved in a 1982 agreement on compensation.

More than 20 interested parties, including the African Union, have asked to take part in the hearings. No date has been set for a decision.

A famine was averted in the region last year largely thanks to international aid, but millions of people in Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon were still in dire need of help, Lowcock told reporters on the sidelines of the Berlin conference. 
""The crisis is not over. There are still 10 million people who need lifesaving assistance,"" he said. ""A quarter of the people we are trying to reach are displaced from their homes and the only means of staying alive they have is what is provided by humanitarian organizations.""
Lowcock said last year's donor conference in Oslo, Norway had raised $672 million in funds for the region, and he expected to double that amount this year, which will allow more work to be done addressing underlying problems in the region.
Detailed pledges were not immediately available. Over 50 delegations are attending the conference.
Germany, a key destination for migrants fleeing Africa and non-permanent member of the U.N. Security Council from 2019, is co-hosting a two-day conference with Norway, Nigeria and the United Nations to drum up support for the region. 
Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling coalition had vowed to help African nations improve conditions to keep people from embarking on treacherous journeys to try to reach Europe.
German Development Minister Gerd Mueller, just back from a visit to Chad, said 2.4 million people have already fled the region due to climate change and violence blamed on the Boko Haram insurgent movement and Islamic State.
""We need a joint European solution. And the international community must get far more engaged for the overall region to give these people a chance for survival and undercut a breeding ground for terrorism,"" Mueller said in a statement.
He said it was vital that donors actually provided the funds they pledged, noting that only third of the needs identified by international organizations had been covered to date.
Achim Steiner, head of the U.N. Development Programme, warned that more people could flee the region unless the international community stepped in to provide long-term perspectives for people in the region.

""We should remember that we made a mistake eight years ago when the Syria crisis began and many people were forced to flee,"" he told Reuters in an interview, noting that U.N. agencies were forced in that case to close hospitals and schools and halve food rations due to a shortage of funds.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Saturday further four-way Ukraine talks, known as the Normandy format, were impossible after Alexander Zakharchenko, leader of Russian-backed separatists in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, died in an explosion at a cafe on Friday.
The Normandy talks led to a ceasefire agreement signed in the Belarus capital Minsk, which ended large-scale fighting in 2015, although deadly exchanges still take place across the truce line dividing government forces from separatists.
France and Germany both said on Monday that the killing of Zakharchenko made the peace process more urgent.
""The latest developments in Eastern Ukraine do not call into question the obligations of the parties under the Minsk agreements, nor the relevance of the Normandy format meetings between Germany, France, Russia and Ukraine,"" a French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said. ""It is precisely when tensions arise that negotiations must be made in good faith."" 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel's government spokesman Steffen Seibert said: ""It's of paramount importance that an escalation is avoided now.""
The death of Zakharchenko should not derail the peace process and Germany would stick to the four-way talks, Seibert said.
Russian-backed rebels threw off Ukrainian central rule in an armed uprising after pro-Western leaders opposed by Moscow came to power in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, in 2014.

Ukraine and Western countries say the rebels were organized, armed and funded by Moscow, and assisted by Russian ground troops. Moscow denies intervening.

YANGON (Reuters) - The Myanmar military issued a rare apology on Monday, acknowledging that two photographs it published in a book on the crisis over the Rohingya Muslim minority were ""published incorrectly"".
Reuters published an exclusive report on Friday revealing that two of the pictures in the book that aimed at illustrating the army's account of last year's events in the western Myanmar state of Rakhine, were in fact archive pictures of different conflicts, and one was posted with an incorrect caption.
The erroneous publication of the photographs comes amid a series of government steps against what it has seen as media abuses, including a report on army activity in an ethnic minority guerrilla zone and the flying of a drone in the capital, Naypyitaw.
On Monday, a court jailed for seven years two reporters from Reuters on a charge of violating a secrets law.
Reuters found that two of the photographs in the military book on the Rohingya crisis were actually taken in Bangladesh and Tanzania and a third was falsely labeled as showing Rohingya entering Myanmar from Bangladesh, when in reality the picture was of refugees leaving Myanmar.
The military's official newspaper, the Myawady Daily, issued a statement on Monday from its publishing arm, which produced the book 'Myanmar Politics and Tatmadaw: Part I', apologizing for two of the photographs.
""It was found that two photos were incorrectly published,"" the publishing arm said in a statement carried by the newspaper, referring to the photograph from Tanzania and another showing victims of Bangladesh's 1971 war of independence.
""We sincerely apologize to the readers and the owners of the photographs for the mistake,"" it said.
It did not mention the photograph incorrectly captioned as showing Rohingya entering Myanmar when the picture was of them leaving.
Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay and military spokesman Major General Tun Tun Nyi could not be reached for comment.
The army's department of public relations and psychological warfare published the book in English and Burmese in July.
'HEINOUS'
Of the 80 images in the book, most were recent pictures of army chief Min Aung Hlaing meeting foreign dignitaries or other officials visiting Rakhine. 
Of eight photos presented as historical images, Reuters found the provenance of three to be faked and was unable to determine the provenance of the five others.
One faded black-and-white image shows a crowd of men who appear to be on a long march with their backs bent over. ""Bengalis intruded into the country after the British Colonialism occupied the lower part of Myanmar,"" the caption reads.
The photo is apparently intended to depict Rohingya arriving in Myanmar during the colonial era, which ended in 1948. Reuters determined the picture is in fact a distorted version of a color image taken in 1996 of refugees who had fled the genocide in Rwanda.
Another picture, also printed in black-and-white, shows men aboard a rickety boat. ""Bengalis entered Myanmar via the watercourse,"" the caption reads.
Actually, the original photo depicts Rohingya and Bangladeshi migrants leaving Myanmar in 2015, when tens of thousands fled for Thailand and Malaysia. The original has been rotated and blurred so the photo looks granular. It was sourced from Myanmar's own Ministry of Information.
The Myawady's publishing arm, in its statement, made no mention of an alterations of images.
The prime minister of neighboring Bangladesh, where about 700,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from a Myanmar military crackdown launched after Rohingya insurgent attacks in August last year, denounced the use of the photographs when she was asked in a news conference about them.
""What Myanmar has done is simply heinous. They have lowered their reputation,"" Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina told a news conference in Dhaka on Sunday.
""They are diminishing their position in the international arena.""
The 117-page book gives the army's account of the crackdown last year which led to reports of mass killings, rape, and arson.
Much of the content is sourced to the military's ""True News"" information unit, which since the start of the crisis has distributed news giving the army's position, mostly via Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).

The book is on sale at bookstores across the commercial capital of Yangon.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Millions of Palestinian refugees ""cannot simply be wished away"", the head of a U.N. support agency said on Monday, hitting back at a U.S. aid cutoff and allegations its work only perpetuates their plight.
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) provides services to about 5 million Palestinian refugees across Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the West Bank and Gaza. Most are descendants of some 700,000 Palestinians who were driven out of their homes or fled fighting in the 1948 war that led to Israel's creation.
The growing refugee count was cited by Washington, UNRWA's biggest donor, in its decision last week to withhold funding, and has potential ramifications for the Palestinians' pursuit of a right of return to land now in Israel.
Successive Israeli governments have ruled out such an influx, fearing the country would lose its Jewish majority.
""I express deep regret and disappointment at the nature of the U.S. decision,"" UNRWA Commissioner-General Pierre Krahenbuhl said in an open letter to Palestinian refugees and the agency's staff in which he pledged its operations would continue.
Appearing to echo Israel's view that descendants of the 1948 refugees should not share that status, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert criticized UNRWA on Friday over its ""endlessly and exponentially expanding community of entitled beneficiaries"". 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described UNRWA on Sunday as ""the refugee perpetuation agency"" whose money ""should be taken and be used to really help rehabilitate the refugees, whose real number is a sliver of that reported by UNRWA"".
But Krahenbuhl said ""the protracted nature of the Palestine refugee crisis"" was not unique. He said the children and grandchildren of long-displaced refugees in Afghanistan, Sudan, Somalia, Congo and elsewhere are also recognized as refugees and assisted by the United Nations.
SCHOOLS OPEN 
""No matter how often attempts are made to minimize or delegitimize the individual and collective experiences of Palestine refugees, the undeniable fact remains that they have rights under international law and represent a community of 5.4 million men, women and children who cannot simply be wished away,"" he said.
The United States paid out $60 million to UNRWA in January, withholding another $65 million, from a promised $365 million for the year. Krahenbuhl said Gulf states had injected funds but UNRWA still needed more than $200 million.
In Lebanon on Monday, UNRWA opened its school year as scheduled. Studies in UNRWA-run schools in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip got under way on Wednesday.
Claudio Cordone, director of UNRWA Affairs in Lebanon, told Reuters that funds would last only until the end of the month but the agency would continue to raise money to ensure the schools remain open.
Washington's move against UNRWA was the latest in a series of U.S. and Israeli policy decisions that have angered Palestinians and raised international concern.

They include Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December, the moving of the U.S. Embassy to the contested city in May and Israel's adoption of a ""nation-state"" law in July that says only Jews have the right of self-determination in the country.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The southern Indian state of Kerala is battling an outbreak of a bacterial disease that authorities suspect has killed dozens of people since mid-August after the worst flooding in a century.
A health ministry spokesman said as of Sunday there had been nearly 200 confirmed cases of what is locally called rat fever - the waterborne disease leptospirosis transmitted via the urine of infected animals, with symptoms including muscle pain and fever.
The surge in cases comes after torrential rain beginning on Aug. 8 flooded almost the entire state, killing hundreds of people, destroying thousands of homes and causing at least 200 billion rupees ($2.81 billion) worth of damage.
The health ministry began distributing preventive medicine last month and warned about the outbreak of leptospirosis and other waterborne diseases such as typhoid and cholera, Health Minister K.K. Shailaja told reporters.
Local media reported three leptospirosis deaths on Monday.
""The victims had unfortunately not taken preventive medicine,"" the minister said.
Overall, nine deaths from the disease have been confirmed, but the number may rise to over 40 pending full medical reports, the ministry spokesman said.
FAST INFECTION
Leptospirosis rarely spreads from person to person and can be treated with common antibiotics.
""In the past week, we have seen about 30 deaths in Kozhikode and Wayanad,"" said Mohammed Javeed, internal medicine specialist at a private hospital in Kerala, referring to two of the worst flood-affected districts on the state's southwest coast.
Javeed said the state has leptospirosis cases every monsoon season as paddy fields fill with water, increasing the chance of infection for farmers, especially through wounds such as cuts.
Of particular concern, however, is that some of the victims this year did not have usual symptoms such as mild jaundice, blood in urine or bleeding spots on the skin, he said.
""This time it is a fast, progressive infection,"" Javeed told Reuters. ""The recent deaths indicate clearly the threat of an epidemic.""
Medical professionals are continuing to dispense preventive medicine in the form of tablets which need to be taken once a week for a month, Javeed said.

YANGON (Reuters) - Time and again, Myanmar's government appeared at risk of blowing its prosecution of two young journalists who had exposed a massacre of 10 Muslim men and implicated security forces in the killings.
On April 20, a prosecution witness revealed in pre-trial hearings that police planted military documents on Reuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo in order to frame them for violating the country's Official Secrets Act. That admission drew gasps from the courtroom.
A police officer told the court that he burned notes he made at the time of the reporters' arrest, but didn't explain why. Several prosecution witnesses contradicted the police account of where the arrests took place. A police major conceded the ""secret"" information allegedly found on the reporters wasn't actually a secret.
And outside the courtroom, military officials even admitted that the killings had indeed taken place.
These bombshells bolstered central assertions of the defense: The arrests were a ""pre-planned and staged"" effort to silence the truthful reporting of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo.
In the end, the holes in the case were not enough to stop the government from punishing the two reporters for revealing an ugly chapter in the history of Myanmar's young democracy. On Monday, after 39 court appearances and 265 days of imprisonment, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were found guilty of breaching the Official Secrets Act and sentenced to seven years in prison.
Yangon northern district judge Ye Lwin ruled that the two reporters had breached the secrets act when they collected and obtained confidential documents. Delivering his verdict in the small courtroom, he said it had been found that ""confidential documents"" discovered on the two would have been useful ""to enemies of the state and terrorist organizations.""
After the verdict was delivered, Wa Lone told a cluster of friends and reporters not to worry. ""We know we did nothing wrong,"" he said, addressing reporters outside the courtroom. ""I have no fear. I believe in justice, democracy and freedom.""
The prosecution of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo has become a landmark press freedom case in Myanmar and a test of the nation's transition to democratic governance since decades of rule by a military junta ended in 2011. The military, though, still controls key government ministries and is guaranteed 25 percent of parliamentary seats, giving it much power in the fledgling democracy.
During the court hearings, U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres and leaders from several Western countries had called for the reporters' release. After the verdict, Scot Marciel, the U.S. ambassador to Myanmar, said the ruling was ""deeply troubling"" for everybody who had struggled for media freedom in the country. ""I'm sad for Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo and their families, but also for Myanmar,"" he said.
Reuters Editor-in-Chief Stephen J. Adler said the two reporters had been convicted ""without any evidence of wrongdoing and in the face of compelling evidence of a police set-up."" The verdict, he said, was ""a major step backward in Myanmar's transition to democracy.""
Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay did not respond to requests for comment about the verdict.
A week before the ruling, United Nations investigators said in a report that Myanmar's military had carried out mass killings and gang rapes of Muslim Rohingya with ""genocidal intent,"" and that the commander-in-chief and five generals should be punished. The report also accused the government of Aung San Suu Kyi of contributing to ""the commission of atrocity crimes"" by failing to shield minorities from crimes against humanity and war crimes. Myanmar has rejected the findings.
Suu Kyi, the country's de facto leader who spent some 15 years under house arrest during the junta era, has made few public statements about the case. In a rare comment in June, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate told Japanese broadcaster NHK that the reporters weren't arrested for covering the violence in western Myanmar. ""They were arrested because they broke the Official Secrets Act,"" she said.
The act dates back to 1923, when Myanmar - then known as Burma - was under British rule. The charge against the reporters carried a maximum sentence of 14 years. Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were found guilty under Section 3.1 (c) of the act, which covers obtaining secret official documentation that ""might be or is intended to be, directly or indirectly, useful to an enemy.""
At the time of their arrest in December, Wa Lone, now 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, now 28, were working on a Reuters investigation into the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim villagers during an army crackdown in Rakhine State in the west of the country. The violence has sent more than 700,000 Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh, where they now live in vast refugee camps.
The United States has accused the government of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya, a Muslim minority who are widely reviled in this majority-Buddhist country. Myanmar says its operations in Rakhine were a legitimate response to attacks on security forces by Rohingya insurgents.
Reuters published its investigation into the massacre on Feb. 8. An account of the killing of eight men and two high school students in September in the village of Inn Din, the report prompted international demands for a credible probe into the wider bloodshed in Rakhine.
The story and its accompanying photographs provided the first independent confirmation of what took place at Inn Din. Two of the photos obtained by the reporters show the men kneeling, in one with their hands behind their necks and in a second with their hands tied behind their backs. A third picture shows their bodies, some apparently with bullet wounds, others with gashes, in a blood-stained, shallow grave.
SLEEP DEPRIVED
The prosecution of the reporters put Aung San Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, in the glare of an uncomfortable global spotlight. Hailed as a champion of democracy for standing up to the junta, Suu Kyi was released from house arrest in 2010. Her party won a general election in 2015 and formed Myanmar's first civilian government in more than half a century in early 2016. Her cabinet includes three generals, however; in a speech last month, she called these military men ""all rather sweet.""
Earlier this year, veteran U.S. politician Bill Richardson said Suu Kyi was ""furious"" with him when he raised the case of the Reuters journalists with her. Richardson, a former Clinton administration cabinet member, resigned in January from an international panel set up by Myanmar to advise on the Rohingya crisis, saying the body was conducting a ""whitewash"" and accusing Suu Kyi of lacking ""moral leadership."" Suu Kyi's office said at the time that Richardson was ""pursuing his own agenda"" and had been asked to step down.
As leader of the opposition, Suu Kyi had criticized the junta's treatment of journalists. In 2014, she reportedly described as ""very excessive"" a prison sentence of 10 years with hard labor handed down to four local journalists and their boss. They were found guilty of trespassing and violating the Official Secrets Act, the same law used to prosecute the Reuters reporters. ""While there are claims of democratic reform, this is questionable when the rights of journalists are being controlled,"" the local Irrawaddy newspaper quoted her as telling reporters in July 2014.
A government spokesman did not answer calls by Reuters seeking comment on Suu Kyi's statement.
Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were arrested on the evening of Dec. 12. During hours of testimony in July, they described that night and the interrogations that followed. They told the court that their heads were covered with black hoods when they were transported to a police interrogation site. They testified they were deprived of sleep for three days during their grillings. At one point, Kyaw Soe Oo said, he was punished and made to kneel on the floor for at least three hours. A police witness denied that the reporters were deprived of sleep and that Kyaw Soe Oo was forced to kneel.
Describing the night of their arrest, Wa Lone said he and Kyaw Soe Oo were detained almost immediately after being handed some documents at a restaurant by a police lance corporal he had been trying to interview for the massacre story. The policeman had invited Wa Lone to meet and Kyaw Soe Oo accompanied him, Wa Lone testified.
When the two reporters exited the restaurant, they were grabbed by men in plain clothes, handcuffed and shoved into separate vehicles, they both testified. As they were driven to a police station, Wa Lone recalled in court, a man who appeared to be in charge called a senior officer and told him: ""We've got them, sir.""
The interrogation centered on the journalists' reporting and their discovery of the massacre, not on the allegedly secret state documents, Wa Lone told the court. One officer, he said, offered ""possible negotiations"" if the massacre story wasn't published. Wa Lone said he rejected the overture.
At one point, Wa Lone testified, the police chastised him for reporting on the Rohingya. ""You are both Buddhists. Why are you writing about 'kalars' at a time like this? They aren't citizens,"" Wa Lone recalled being told. 'Kalar' is a slur widely used in Myanmar to describe Muslims, especially Rohingya and people of South Asian origin.
It was two weeks from the time of their arrest before Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were allowed contact with their families and lawyers.
In late December, they were sent to Yangon's Insein Prison, a colonial-era building that became an emblem of the former military junta's repressive rule. For decades, dissidents were held alongside murderers, thieves and drug dealers. Suu Kyi spent a brief period there.
""I found out my cell was built in 1865. It was used for the prisoners before they were killed,"" Wa Lone told a colleague before one court hearing, amused to have discovered he was living on a Victorian-era death row.
THUMBS-UP SIGN
The first hearing came on Dec. 27, which was overcast with a few specks of drizzle. Some reporters had gathered outside the courthouse before dawn in case police tried to rush through the proceedings. Many from local media wore black T-shirts in solidarity with the Reuters reporters.
Wa Lone's wife, Pan Ei Mon, mouthed quiet prayers between interviews with journalists. Kyaw Soe Oo's sister, Nyo Nyo Aye, kept near her side, barely speaking.
When a white Toyota police van swung into the yard, Pan Ei Mon and Nyo Nyo Aye pushed through scrambling photographers and hugged the two men as they were led into the courthouse. Within minutes, the court extended their remand for 14 days. An application for bail was refused on Feb. 1.
After that, the two reporters were put in a pick-up truck almost weekly to make the roughly half-kilometer journey to Yangon's Northern District Court, a dilapidated two storey red-brick building. Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo would arrive at court handcuffed. Holding his hands clenched and at chest-level, Wa Lone looked like a boxer entering a ring, smiling and giving a thumbs-up sign for the cameras.
If there was a break in proceedings, the men were allowed to join their families in a side room, where they were fed and hugged. Kyaw Soe Oo's daughter, Moe Thin Wai Zan, now three, would cling to her father. From time to time, he carefully lowered his handcuffs over her head and peppered her face with kisses.
Wa Lone's wife, Pan Ei Mon, sat as close to her husband as she could during the hearings. She gave birth to a girl, the couple's first child, on Aug. 10.
The courtroom could hold around 40 people and was invariably packed with family, friends, reporters and foreign diplomats. Sparrows flitted through gaps above the saloon-style doors and nested in the rafters; a cat sometimes wandered through the court. From a nearby room sounded the clacking of an old-fashioned typewriter. Power cuts were routine, and during the humid summer, the room warmed quickly as the single ceiling fan slowed to a halt. In a familiar drill, a court official would hustle spectators aside to fetch a generator and lug it into a hallway, where it chugged until the session was over.
Flanked by policemen, Wa Lone would often make an impassioned statement to the media outside court after hearings. On the day the court charged the reporters, he raised his voice and spoke quickly: ""For us, no matter what, we won't retreat, give up or be shaken by this. I would like to say that injustice will never defeat us.""
Police said Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were caught in Yangon with secret information about the operations of security forces in Rakhine, the state where the Inn Din massacre took place. The reporters, they said, were detained after being searched at a traffic checkpoint by officers who didn't know they were journalists.
But early in the proceedings, the police version of events began to fray. At a hearing on Feb. 1, a police major, who led the team of arresting officers, conceded that the information in the documents had already been published in newspaper reports. It was one of many inconsistencies to surface during testimony from the 22 witnesses called by the prosecution.
The precise location and circumstances surrounding the arrests emerged as a key point of contention in court. The police said the reporters were stopped and searched at a traffic checkpoint at the junction of Main Road No. 3 and Nilar Road by officers who were unaware they were journalists - not at a restaurant, as Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo testified.
One prosecution witness, civilian official Kyaw Shein, supported the police on the location of the arrests. Then, in a moment of courtroom drama, defense lawyer Than Zaw Aung reached through the wooden bars of the witness stand and turned over Kyaw Shein's left hand, which the witness had been glancing at while giving testimony. On it were written the words ""Thet Oo Maung"" - the official name of Wa Lone - and below it, ""No. 3 Road and Nilar Road junction."" (It is common for people in Myanmar to use more than one name, as Wa Lone does.)
Asked if someone had told him to write down the address where police say the arrest took place, Kyaw Shein said no. He wrote on his hand because he was ""forgetful,"" he said.
'ENTRAP HIM AND ARREST HIM'
On April 10, in a move that acknowledged the truth of the Reuters report on the Inn Din massacre, the army announced that seven soldiers had been sentenced to ""10 years in prison with hard labor in a remote area"" for participating in the killings.
Ten days later, the state's case against Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo appeared to suffer a setback when the court heard the reporters' version of events - astonishingly, from a prosecution witness. They had in fact been arrested as they left a restaurant still holding in their hands documents they had just been given by police officers as part of a plan to ensnare them, said Captain Moe Yan Naing of the paramilitary 8th Security Police Battalion.
Before the reporters were arrested, Wa Lone had interviewed several members of Battalion 8 about the army crackdown in Rakhine. At least three police officers told him that the unit supported military operations there.
Moe Yan Naing testified that he was interviewed by Wa Lone in November, and had himself been under arrest since the night of Dec. 12. Earlier that day, he said, he had been taken to Battalion 8's headquarters on the northern edges of Yangon. When he arrived, he said, he found himself among a group of several policemen who were believed to have given interviews to Wa Lone. They were interrogated about their interactions with the Reuters reporter.
Moe Yan Naing told the court that police Brigadier General Tin Ko Ko, who led an internal probe into what the reporters had been told, ordered an officer to arrange a meeting with Wa Lone that night and hand over ""secret documents from Battalion 8.""
Brigadier General Tin Ko Ko gave the documents to a police lance corporal ""and told him to give them to Wa Lone,"" Moe Yan Naing testified. When Wa Lone left the restaurant, the general continued, the local police were to ""entrap him and arrest him,"" according to Moe Yan Naing. He told the court he witnessed Tin Ko Ko giving these orders.
""Police Brigadier General Tin Ko Ko told the police members, 'If you don't get Wa Lone, you will go to jail',"" Moe Yan Naing said.
""This officer spoke based on his own feelings,"" police spokesman Colonel Myo Thu Soe told Reuters, referring to Moe Yan Naing.
In the days following his testimony, Moe Yan Naing's wife and three children were evicted from police housing in the capital city of Naypyitaw, and he was sentenced to one year in prison for violating the Police Disciplinary Act by having contact with Wa Lone. The prosecution sought to have Moe Yan Naing declared an unreliable witness. Nevertheless, Judge Ye Lwin declared he was credible. The captain returned to court two weeks later - this time in shackles and wearing a dark blue prison uniform - to give further testimony.
A police lance corporal, who met the reporters in the restaurant moments before they were arrested, contradicted Moe Yan Naing's account of a set-up operation. Naing Lin, the lance corporal, denied giving the Reuters reporters secret documents to incriminate them. He also denied calling Wa Lone to invite him to a meeting on Dec. 12. During cross-examination, though, defense lawyer Than Zaw Aung said phone records showed that Naing Lin had called the journalist three times on that day.
In the end, the defense's ability to punch holes in the prosecution's case proved to be insufficient ammunition. Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo's exposure of atrocities against a despised minority had put them on a collision course with Aung San Suu Kyi, the generals and their nation's Buddhist majority.

244,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2018 07:49AM ET</span>",Pakistan girds for 'exchanges' with Pompeo as U.S. halts military funding,"By Asif Shahzad and Kay Johnson
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's new foreign minister said he will ""have exchanges"" with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo over Washington's cancellation of a $300 million disbursement for the Pakistani military when he visits Islamabad on Wednesday.
Adopting a tougher line with an ally that U.S. President Donald Trump considers unreliable, the United States halted the disbursement of Coalition Support Funds due to Islamabad’s perceived failure to take decisive action against Afghan Taliban militants operating from Pakistani soil. 
The United States has now withheld $800 million from the CSF so far this year. 
The latest move comes just as the less-than-one-month-old government of Prime Minister Imran Khan faces a looming balance of payments crisis that could force it to seek a fresh bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), or other lenders.
“On the 5th, the American (secretary of state) Pompeo will be arriving, and we will have a chance to sit down with him. There will be exchanges,"" Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi told reporters late on Sunday night.
""We will take our mutual respect for each other into consideration and move forward,"" he added.
Qureshi argued that the U.S. was not justified in cutting the $300 million because it was intended to reimburse Pakistan's military for money spent fighting the Taliban and other militants threatening U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
""It is not aid. It is not assistance, which was suspended. This the money, which we have spent. This is our money. We have spent it,"" Qureshi said. ""We did it for our betterment, which they had to reimburse.”
Officially allies in fighting terrorism, Pakistan and the United States have a complicated relationship, bound by Washington's dependence on Pakistan to guarantee a supply route for U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
U.S. officials have repeatedly accused Pakistan of playing a double game, by covertly providing safe havens for Afghan Taliban insurgents and fighters from the Haqqani group, who are waging a 17-year-old war against Afghanistan's U.S.-backed government. 
Pakistan consistently denies providing safe havens for the militants.
In an editorial on Monday, Pakistan's English-language Dawn newspaper railed against the Trump administration's decision to halt the disbursement of funds.
""The U.S. has delivered an object lesson in how not to conduct diplomacy,"" Pakistan's English-language Dawn newspaper said in an editorial on Monday.
It went on to speculate whether Pompeo would ""try and bully the Pakistani leadership during his visit or if he will be deployed in a more traditional 'good cop' diplomatic role.""
Pompeo will be accompanied by top U.S. military officer, General Joseph Dunford, for talks with the Pakistani leadership.
Relations between the new Pakistani government and Washington got off to a rocky start last month when Qureshi publicly disputed that Pompeo had brought up the thorny issue of terrorist havens in a phone call with Prime Minister Khan.
The Pakistani side later downplayed the issue after Washington shared a transcript of the call, Pakistani media reported.
The Trump administration a year ago resolved to take tougher line with Pakistan than previous U.S. administrations.
In his first tweet of 2018, Trump slammed Pakistan, saying the country has rewarded past U.S. aid with ""nothing but lies & deceit."" Washington announced plans in January to suspend up to roughly $2 billion in U.S. security assistance to Pakistan.

245,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2018 07:49AM ET</span>","In South Africa, white Sasol workers protest against black share scheme","JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Workers from South Africa's mainly white Solidarity union staged a go-slow protest at the petrochemicals firm Sasol on Monday over a share scheme offered exclusively to black staff, and said they would begin a full strike on Thursday.
South African companies are required to meet quotas on black ownership, employment and procurement as part of a drive to reverse decades of exclusion under apartheid.
Sasol, the world leader in technology that converts coal and gas to fuel, has sold 25 percent of its local operations to qualifying black employees, a foundation and the black public in a 21 billion rand ($1.42 billion) deal financed by the company.
It has said the scheme is not a benefit but a mechanism designed to meet the rules on black economic empowerment.
But Solidarity said the scheme was discriminatory and that it would file a complaint to U.S. regulators. Sasol also operates in the United States.
Solidarity said its 6,300 members would hold a go-slow at Sasol's facilities in South Africa, and then strike on Thursday. 
Dirk Hermann, Solidarity's chief executive, said the union would file its complaint in the U.S. by early next week.
The union said the scheme excluded both white staff and foreign nationals.
""We are not against the scheme, we just want it to be inclusive of all workers. If the company makes it inclusive, the majority will still be black, so we see no need to exclude white workers as this is discrimination,"" Herman said.
Sasol, which employs around 26,000 people in South Africa, said it was aware of Solidarity's intent to strike.
A Sasol spokesman said he would give an update on the go-slow later in the day.
Sasol's shares were 0.6 percent lower at 572.29 rand.
""It depends on the duration of the strike, at this point there is little impact,"" said Wilmar Buys, a director at FFO Securities. ""The stock is being propped up by the weaker rand and higher oil price at this point in time.""
A weaker rand strengthens Sasol's earnings because most of its products are sold in dollars.
South Africa's rand traded nearly a percent lower as demand for emerging market currencies weakened. Oil prices rose, supported by concerns that falling Iranian output will tighten markets once U.S. sanctions start biting.

""(The Sasol go-slow) has not caught the eye, but the market is keeping an eye on it,"" said Desmond Reilly, a trader at PSG Securities. ($1 = 14.7478 rand)

If other member parties were to back Weber, who leads the center-right European People's Party caucus in the European Union Parliament, the Bavarian conservative would be frontrunner to succeed Jean-Claude Juncker as the EU's day-to-day leader.
The EU is attempting to navigate a world in which a Donald Trump-led United States is seen as an unreliable partner, Russia and China are offering stiff competition and Britain's departure is forcing the bloc to reinvent itself.
""I really hope the (German conservatives) make our Manfred Weber the lead candidate for the European election,"" Soeder said in a beer tent speech in Abensberg, near Regensberg in Bavaria.
Weber and Soeder are both members of the Christian Social Union (CSU), Bavarian sister party to Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
Several German newspapers reported last week that Merkel had given her backing to Weber's bid to front the center-right in the European Parliament elections in May.
As leader of the EU's most populous and wealthiest country, Merkel would have considerable influence over the EPP's choice of the center-right's ""Spitzenkandidat"", or candidate for president of the European Commission.
The EPP's member parties are in government in nine of the bloc's 28 members, and lead in polls across much of Europe.

It has been decades since a German has headed the Brussels-based Commission, whose 30,000 staff draft and enforce legislation and has been instrumental in driving the process of European integration since the bloc's beginnings in 1957.

247,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2018 06:46AM ET</span>",Iran says militants must be 'cleaned out' of Syria's Idlib,"(Reuters) - Militants must be ""cleaned out"" of Syria's Idlib province, Iran's Foreign Minister said on Monday as he prepared for talks between Iran, Syria and Russia about confronting the last major enclave held by rebels opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
Syrian government forces are preparing a phased offensive in Idlib and surrounding areas held by rebels fighting Assad, a close Russian ally who has also been backed by Iranian forces in the country's civil war.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday Washington viewed the government assault on Idlib as an escalation of Syria's war, and the State Department warned that Washington would respond to any chemical attack by Damascus.
The Iranian Minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, spoke at the start of a visit to Damascus for talks with Syrian officials about a Sept. 7 meeting between Iran, Turkey and Russia on confronting militants in Idlib, Iranian state media reported.
""All of Syrian territory must be preserved and all the sects and groups should start the round of reconstruction as one collective and the displaced should return to their families,"" Zarif said, according to Fars News.
""And the remaining terrorists in the remaining parts of Idlib must be cleaned out and the region should be placed back under the control of the Syrian people.""
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani is scheduled to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan in Iran, according to Fars News. The Kremlin says the meeting will take place in Tehran on Sept. 7.
JIHADIST ALLIANCE
The meeting will focus on the battle against remaining militant groups in Syria, Zarif said. 
""In the meeting that we will have in Tehran next Friday as a continuation of the three-way political round the methods of how to confront extremist and terrorist groups, like Tahrir al-Sham, will be examined,"" Zarif said, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA).
Zarif did not say whether the meeting will take place between the presidents of the three countries or between other senior officials. 
Last week, Iran's defense minister traveled to Damascus and signed an agreement for defense cooperation between the two countries with his Syrian counterpart.
Tahrir al-Sham, which includes the al Qaeda-linked group formerly known as Nusra Front, is the most powerful jihadist alliance in Idlib. 
Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said Iran would continue its support for Syrian government forces in its battle in Idlib.
""The government of Syria has the right to fight against terrorists in this region. And Iran, as a supporter of the Syrian government, is present and will continue its advisory help as long as the Syrian government wants,"" Qassemi said, according to Fars News.

Zarif went to Sayeda Zeinab, a shrine south of Damascus revered by Shi'ites, as his first stop on the trip, according to Fars News. Zarif met his counterpart Walid al-Muallem on Monday according to a posting on the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page of the Syrian foreign ministry and is scheduled to meet Assad on the one-day trip, according to Iranian media.

248,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2018 06:40AM ET</span>",Ireland must respect U.S. president's office when Trump visits: PM,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - The Irish government must treat the U.S. president's office with the respect it deserves when Donald Trump visits in November despite disagreeing with many of his policies, Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said ahead of planned protests.
Trump will travel to Ireland for the first time as president during a trip to Europe to attend a Nov. 11 commemoration in Paris of the 100th anniversary of the armistice that ended World War One, the White House said on Friday.
The president's decision to take up an open invitation to Ireland in November ""came a little bit out of the blue"", said Varadkar, who as a minister was against extending an invitation to Trump before changing his mind when he became prime minister.
A number of smaller opposition parties have begun organizing protests to coincide with the visit. 
""I know a lot of people dislike him, a lot of people object to him, a lot of people disagree with a lot of his policies, just as I do in fact,"" Varadkar said in an interview with national broadcaster RTE late on Sunday.
""But he is the president of America and the relationship between Ireland and the United States is much more important than any Irish government or any U.S. administration and I think we have to treat his office with the respect that it deserves.""
Low tax Ireland is also a major beneficiary of investment by U.S. firms with almost 800 U.S.-based companies including major employers such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) accounting for around 7 percent of the country's workforce.
Trump will visit his golf resort in the west coast village of Doonbeg as well as Dublin during the brief trip, Varadkar said.
The Irish Prime Minister will use an expected meeting with Trump to raise issues including trade, migration, human rights and Britain's exit from the European Union which is set to hit Ireland harder than any other remaining EU member.

""As you know, he's very supportive of Brexit and I once again want to explain to him why that's not the right position either for America or for Europe,"" said Varadkar, who met Trump in the White House in March.

249,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2018 06:20AM ET</span>",South Korea may seek change in controversial military exemption for athletes,"By Hyonhee Shin and Joori Roh
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea may seek to revise its military exemption program for athletes amid calls for stricter rules after the country's soccer and baseball teams earned the reward with gold medals at the Asian Games over the weekend. 
Military service is a highly contentious issue in South Korea, where all able-bodied men must complete about 21 months of service as part of efforts to maintain a deterrent against the North. 
Exemptions are offered to athletes who win titles at the Asian Games or medals of any color at the Olympics, however, and Tottenham Hotspur striker Son Heung-min along with his team mates earned that right when they struck gold on Saturday. 
Nine baseball players who had not yet completed their service also received the exemption after winning the Asian Games title in Jakarta on Saturday, but they could be among the last athletes to be so rewarded. 
Ki Chan-soo, commissioner of the Military Manpower Administration, an arm of the Defence Ministry in charge of conscription, said on Monday that the rule could be amended. 
""We're planning a comprehensive re-examination of the system in the areas of sport and art,"" Ki told Yonhap.
""We're already running short of military personnel resources so we'll start by looking into whether the exemption program is fair."" 
An official at the conscription agency told Reuters that Ki was speaking ""in principle"" in light of recent media and parliamentary inquiries, and no specific plan for a review had been set up. 
The Defence Ministry also said in a statement that it was not considering any change in the system for now but would have intra-agency consultation on the issue. 
The incentive was introduced in the 1970s as part of Seoul's drive to become a world sporting power and raise its profile on the global stage but it has come in for criticism in recent years as the country rebalances its priorities.
Some have called for the exemption system to be abolished altogether, questioning its fairness in an era where the South Korean public have been yearning for an end to privilege and lopsided advantages in all walks of life. 
The baseball team was at the center of the latest controversy as it consisted of top professionals and the national league was put on hold during the Games, while other countries such as Japan and Chinese Taipei sent more amateurs than pros. 
Others, though, believe the system fosters athletic excellence and boosts the country's image. 
""I don't really think it's unfair ... he is one of the most famous South Korean stars in the world,"" Jang Ji-hoon, who is currently serving in the military, said of Son.
""I just hope that he does not go into the service and develops himself during that time instead.""
According to a survey in July by pollster Realmeter, nearly 48 percent supported scaling up the incentive for athletes, while 44 percent were opposed. 
K-POP BOYBANDS 
Ha Tae-keung, an opposition lawmaker, said the program should also be expanded to include other professions such as K-Pop boybands.
An artist who takes first or second place in a government-designated international contest can be granted an exemption but the fields eligible for the benefit are largely confined to classical music and dance. 
Ha pointed out that the BTS band topped the Billboard 200 albums chart for the second time this year on Sunday with its latest album ""Love Yourself: Answer"" -- an unprecedented feat in K-pop history. 
""The program should be open to other areas but with a higher threshold, say, number one worldwide, not Asia,"" Ha told Reuters.
Ha and some other experts have proposed a scheme under which athletes acquire a certain amount of points from international competitions to qualify for exemption. 
Lee Kee-heung, president of the Korean Sport & Olympic Committee, expressed support for the idea on Sunday, saying he would raise the issue for discussion.
Advocates say such a cumulative program would help prevent attempts to evade military service, such as a 2012 case in which then Arsenal striker Park Chu-young gained Monaco residency to postpone enlistment, to uproar at home, before winning exemption at the London Olympics. 
""I am a little jealous of Son Heung-min, because I have to go for military service soon,"" said Kang Min-jae, a 20-year-old South Korean university student. 
""I will protect the country instead of him as he contributes to the nation a lot.""

250,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2018 06:12AM ET</span>",Israel signals it could attack Iranian weaponry in Iraq,"By Dan Williams
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel signaled on Monday that it could attack suspected Iranian military assets in Iraq, as it has done with scores of air strikes in war-torn Syria. 
Citing Iranian, Iraqi and Western sources, Reuters reported last week that Iran had transferred short-range ballistic missiles to Shi'ite allies in Iraq in recent months. Tehran and Baghdad formally denied that report. 
Israel sees in Iran's regional expansion an attempt to open up new fronts against it. Israel has repeatedly launched attacks in Syria to prevent any entrenchment of Iranian forces helping Damascus in the war. 
""We are certainly monitoring everything that is happening in Syria and, regarding Iranian threats, we are not limiting ourselves just to Syrian territory. This also needs to be clear,"" Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman told a conference hosted and aired live by the Israel Television News Company.
Asked if that included possible action in Iraq, Lieberman said: ""I am saying that we will contend with any Iranian threat, and it doesn't matter from where it comes ... Israel's freedom is total. We retain this freedom of action.""
There was no immediate response from the government of Iraq, which is technically at war with Israel, nor from U.S. Central Command in Washington, which oversees U.S. military operations in Iraq. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Saturday he was ""deeply concerned"" by the reported Iranian missile transfer.
""If true, this would be a gross violation of Iraqi sovereignty and of UNSCR 2231,"" he tweeted, referring to a U.N. Security Council resolution endorsing the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran. The Trump administration abandoned that deal in May, citing, among other factors, Iran's ballistic missile projects.
According to regional sources, Israel began carrying out air strikes in Syria in 2013 against suspected arms transfers and deployments by Iran and its Lebanese ally, the Shi'ite Hezbollah militia.
These operations have largely been ignored by Russia, Damascus's big-power backer, and coordinated with other powers conducting their own military operations in Syria. 
A Western diplomat briefed on the coordination told Reuters last year that, while Israel had a ""free hand"" in Syria, it was expected not to take any military action in neighboring Iraq, where the United States has been struggling to help achieve stability since its 2003 invasion to topple Saddam Hussein. 
Despite their formal state of hostilities, Israel and Iraq have not openly traded blows in decades. 
In 1981, Israel's air force destroyed an Iraqi nuclear reactor near Baghdad. During the 1991 Gulf war, Iraq fired dozens of Scud rockets into Israel, which did not retaliate, out of consideration for U.S. efforts to maintain an Arab coalition against Saddam. 
Israel made a plan for its commandos to assassinate Saddam in Iraq in 1992, but the plan was abandoned after a fatal training accident.

The 24-hour strike was organized by Greece's seamen federation (PNO), which said in a statement that negotiations with the sector's employers over a new collective agreement that would include wage increases did not bear fruit.
After eight years of austerity prescribed by the country's international lenders, the European Union and the Internatioanl Monetary Fund, the left-led government has pledged to reverse unpopular labor reforms and increase the minimum wage.
The seamen want wage rises to make up for years of pay cuts implemented during austerity, arguing that their employers have seen a boost in profits in recent years and should be in a position to compensate them for their sacrifices during the crisis.
Traffic was very slow at Piraeus port on Monday morning. Shipping companies were forced to reschedule many trips. 
Passenger traffic at ports and airports picks up during the summer, the top tourism season for the Mediterranean country. Nearly 32 million tourists were expected to visit Greece this year, according to tourism industry officials.

Marine unions have strongly resisted wage cuts and reforms liberalizing the shipping sector, which along with tourism is a pivotal industry for Greece, a country of seafarers.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping offered another $60 billion in financing for Africa on Monday and said Chinese companies will be encouraged to invest no less than $10 billion over the next three years, but he also warned against ""vanity projects"".
Speaking at the opening of a major summit with African leaders, Xi promised development that people on the continent could see and touch, but that would also be green and sustainable.
China has denied engaging in ""debt trap"" diplomacy, and Xi's offer of more money comes after a pledge of another $60 billion at the previous summit in South Africa three years ago.
Xi, addressing leaders at Beijing's Great Hall of the People, said the new $60 billion will include $15 billion of aid, interest-free loans and concessional loans, a credit line of $20 billion, a $10 billion special fund for China-Africa development, and a $5 billion special fund for imports from Africa. 
Chinese companies will be encouraged to invest no less than $10 billion in the continent in the next three years, he said.
""China-Africa cooperation must give Chinese and African people tangible benefits and successes that can be seen, that can be felt,"" Xi said.
Chinese officials have vowed to be more cautious to ensure projects are sustainable. China defends continued lending to Africa on the grounds that the continent still needs debt-funded infrastructure development.
Speaking earlier at a business forum, Xi said China had to be careful about where money was spent.
""China's cooperation with Africa is clearly targeted at the major bottlenecks to development. Resources for our cooperation are not to be spent on any vanity projects but in places where they count the most,"" he said.
Beijing has also fended off criticism it is only interested in resource extraction to feed its own booming economy, that the projects it funds have poor environmental safeguards, and that too many of the workers for them are flown in from China rather than using African labor.
Xi told business leaders Chinese firms in Africa had to be aware of their social responsibilities and make sure their investments served the community and improved their wellbeing.
""I hope that our entrepreneurs will act to fulfill social responsibilities and respect local culture and tradition,"" he said.
""I also hope you will do more in staff training and bettering lives for the local people and will put more emphasis on the environment and resources,"" Xi said.
'AFRICA KNOWS BEST'
Chinese officials say this year's summit will strengthen Africa's role in Xi's Belt and Road initiative to link China by sea and land with Southeast and Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa through an infrastructure network modeled on the old Silk Road. 
Xi said the plan, for which Beijing has pledged $126 billion, would help provide more resources and facilities for Africa and would expand shared markets.
China loaned around $125 billion to the continent from 2000 to 2016, data from the China-Africa Research Initiative at Washington's Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies shows.
State media has accused the West of sour grapes over China's prominent role in Africa and has angrily rejected claims of forcing African countries into a debt trap.
""In terms of cooperation with China, African countries know best,"" widely read tabloid the Global Times wrote in an editorial on Monday. 
""Western media deliberately portray Africans in misery for collaborating with China and they appear to have discovered big news by finding occasional complaints in the African media about Sino-Africa cooperation,"" it said.
Every African country is represented at the business forum apart from eSwatini, self-ruled Taiwan's last African ally that has so far rejected China's overtures to ditch Taipei and recognize Beijing.
African presidents in attendance include South Africa's Cyril Ramaphosa, Egypt's Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Zambia's Edgar Lungu and Gabon's Ali Bongo.
There are some controversial guests. Sudan President Omar al-Bashir, who has been in power for nearly 30 years, is wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for war crimes over killings and persecution in Sudan's Darfur province between 2003 and 2008.
Xi told him on Sunday that ""foreign forces"" should not interfere in Sudan's internal affairs, China's Foreign Ministry said. China is not a party to the court.
""China has always had reservations about the International Criminal Court's indictment and arrest order against Sudan's president. We hope the ICC can prudently handle the relevant issue,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters.

Lim was charged in 2016 with abusing his position as chief minister of the state of Penang by securing a two-storey bungalow below market price.
Lim was a senior opposition leader then and the graft charges were seen by his supporters as a politically motivated move by then prime minister Najib Razak. 
Najib unexpectedly lost a general election earlier this year to veteran Mahathir Mohamad.
Judge Hadhariah Syed Ismail discharged the finance minister after prosecution withdrew the charges, Bernama reported.

The lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community is routinely persecuted in Muslim-majority Malaysia, where they are seen as a threat to conservative values.
The women, aged 32 and 22, had pleaded guilty last month to attempting lesbian sex, forbidden under Islamic law. They were sentenced to a fine and six lashings of the cane.
The sentence was carried out in front of about 100 people at the Sharia High Court in Terengganu, a conservative state ruled by the Islamist opposition party Pan-Malaysian Islamist Party (PAS), according to a report by English-language daily the New Straits Times.
It was the first conviction for same-sex relations and the first time a caning had been carried out in public in the state, Satiful Bahri Mamat, a member of the Terengganu state executive council told Reuters.
""Sharia criminal procedure allows the court to determine where the sentence will be carried out, and requires that it must be witnessed by a number of other Muslims,"" said Satiful, who attended the hearing. Sharia is Islamic law.
Satiful said the punishment was ""not intended to torture or injure"". 
""The reason it is carried out in public is for it to serve as a lesson to society,"" he said. 
Malaysia has a dual-track legal system, with Islamic criminal and family laws applicable to Muslims running alongside civil laws.
The caning of women is banned under civil law, but allowed under Islamic laws in some states.
Amnesty International said the caning marked ""an appalling day"" for human rights in Malaysia.
""To inflict this brutal punishment on two people for attempting to engage in consensual, same-sex relations is an atrocious setback on the government’s efforts to improve its human rights records,"" Rachel Chhoa-Howard, the group's Malaysia researcher, said.
Malaysian women's groups Justice for Sisters and Sisters in Islam called for a review of laws that allowed the caning of women.
""The execution that took place... is a travesty and a grave miscarriage of justice,"" the groups said. 
The case comes amid concerns around growing intolerance toward the LGBT community in Malaysia in recent weeks. 
A transgender woman was beaten up by a group of assailants in Seremban, south of Kuala Lumpur on Aug. 15, in what activists said was part of a growing hostility towards gay and transgender people.

All elementary and middle school students and their parents were told by the education ministry to watch the program ""First Lesson of New Semester"" at 8 p.m. (1200 GMT) on Saturday. 
The program, produced by CCTV and the education ministry since 2008, is aired on Sept. 1 every year to mark the start of the new school calendar after a two-month summer break. This year, the program focused on the ""spirit of creativity"" as China observed its 40th year of opening up.
But TV viewers had to sit through 12 minutes of advertisements on cars and scooters, home appliances, toothpaste and stationery. 
""We sincerely apologize to parents and students for the long TV commercials ahead of the program,"" the state broadcaster CCTV wrote on Weibo, a popular Twitter-like microblog. 
The commercials were dominated by ads on after-school tutoring in a country where a growing middle class is able to afford extra classes aimed at improving the chances of getting better grades and a stab at scholastic glory. 
""Are you so short of money?"" wrote one Weibo user.
The outcry over the commercials coincided with protests by parents over the weekend in a city in southern China about school enrolment. 
Police on Sunday detained 46 people in Leiyang city in Hunan province after bottles, bricks and firecrackers were thrown at officers and government officials during a 600-strong protest.
Many parents also expressed disapproval over the choice of an all-male pop band for the program's opening musical act, saying they were too ""effeminate"". 
""Can we find someone who is more masculine? If our youth is effeminate, so will the country be,"" one angry parent wrote on Weibo.

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit strategy means disaster for Britain, former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said, as critics at home and officials in Brussels step up their opposition to her plans for how to leave the European Union.
With under two months before Britain and the EU want to agree a deal to end over 40 years of union, May is struggling to sell what she calls her business-friendly Brexit to her own party and across a divided country.
Johnson, who some in the governing Conservative Party favor as a potential successor to May, resigned in July in protest at the prime minister's so-called Chequers plan.
""In adopting the Chequers proposals, we have gone into battle with the white flag fluttering over our leading tank. If we continue on this basis we will throw away most of the advantages of Brexit,"" he wrote in the Daily Telegraph newspaper on Monday. ""People can see Chequers means disaster.""
May's plan, which is designed to protect cross-border trade with the EU, will mean Britain loses control over its direction, preventing it from becoming more competitive and doing major trade deals with other countries, he said.
""We will remain in the EU taxi; but this time locked in the boot, with absolutely no say on the destination.""
On Sunday, May sought to allay fears she would cave in to Brussels' demands in negotiations, saying she would not allow compromises to her Brexit strategy that went against the national interest. [nL8N1VO07J]
But the Times newspaper reported 20 of May's Conservative lawmakers were now backing the grassroots 'StandUp4Brexit' campaign committing to opposing the Chequers plan. Parliament returns from its summer break on Tuesday.
May, who has pledged to give lawmakers approval of the final deal with Brussels, has a working majority of 13 members in parliament. If she loses the vote Britain could leave the EU without a deal and possibly force an early election. 
Conservative lawmaker and former government minister Nick Boles, who has launched a campaign for a ""Better Brexit"", said on Monday he didn't think May had enough support for her proposals.
Asked during an interview on BBC Radio what the chances of getting her proposals through parliament, he said: ""Very, very small, as close to zero as anything in politics.""
British media have reported Brexit-supporting Conservative lawmakers are preparing to unveil an alternative plan for Brexit before the party's annual conference at the end of the month.
EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier told a German newspaper on Sunday that he strongly opposed Britain's proposal.

""If we let the British pick the raisins out of our rules, that would have serious consequences. Then all sorts of other third countries could insist that we offer them the same benefits. That would be the end of the single market and the European project,"" he said.

Malaysian business weekly The Edge on Saturday cited sources confirming both countries agreed to postpone the project to May 31, 2020 at no penalty to either, to allow Malaysia time to review its finances.
A senior Malaysian minister on Monday confirmed the sides have agreed to postpone the project at no penalty, and that details would be made clear when a new agreement is signed soon.
""We have agreed to a reasonable period,"" Azmin told reporters at an event when asked how long the project would be postponed, in a recording reviewed by Reuters.
Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad declared his intention to cancel the project just weeks after leading his coalition to victory in a general election in May.
Azmin said Malaysia is committed to the project, but that it would need to be more affordable.
""We want to continue with this project because it will bring good to both countries,"" Azmin said. ""However, over the course of the postponement we will discuss ways to reduce the cost.""
Azmin's office did not respond to requests for details of the postponement.
Singapore's Ministry of Transport declined to comment, referring queries to a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post by its minister, Khaw Boon Wan, in which he said a decision would be announced ""soon"".
In July, Singapore said it would seek to recover over S$250 million ($182.44 million) in costs incurred to date should Malaysia cancel the project.
Mahathir, who launched a review of all multi-billion dollar projects approved by his predecessor, said Malaysia would look to negotiate a deferment of the project to reduce any burden of compensation.

The destruction of the building, once a palace for emperors that had fallen into disrepair, was an ""incalculable loss for Brazil,"" President Michel Temer said in a statement.
""Two hundred years of work, research and knowledge were lost.""
There was no word of the possible cause late on Sunday, nor if there were casualties or the exact extent of damage.
Firefighters in Rio did not reply to requests for comment.
Live television broadcast images of the fire, which began after the end of visiting hours at 5 p.m., burning out of control throughout the building late into the night.
The museum, which is tied to the Rio de Janeiro federal university and the education ministry, was founded in 1818. It houses several landmark collections, including Egyptian artifacts and the oldest human fossil found in Brazil.
The museum had suffered from years of neglect under numerous governments, the institution's vice-director the Globo TV network on Sunday night.

260,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2018 07:54PM ET</span>",Iraqi rival groups both announce parliamentary blocs to form new government,"By Ahmed Aboulenein
BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Rival Iraqi political factions said on Sunday they had each formed alliances capable of forming a government in the new parliament after months of political uncertainty following a May election.
Lawmakers led by cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said they created an alliance that would give them a majority bloc in parliament.
A rival grouping led by militia commander Hadi al-Ameri and former Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki responded by saying it had formed its own alliance that would be the largest bloc in parliament after it got some lawmakers to defect from the other group.
Ameri and Maliki are Iran's two most prominent allies in Iraq. Abadi is seen as the preferred candidate of the United States, while Sadr portrays himself as a nationalist who rejects both American and Iranian influence.
Iraq's parliament contains 329 seats and is set to convene on Monday, when it will elect a speaker and launch the government formation process.
Iraqis voted in May in their first parliamentary election since the defeat of Islamic State's self-declared caliphate, but a contentious recount process delayed the announcement of final results until last month.
The new government will be tasked with rebuilding the country after a three-year war with Islamic State militants and balancing relations between Iraq's two biggest allies: arch-rivals Iran and the United States.
Uncertainty over the composition of the new government has raised tensions at a time when public impatience is growing over poor basic services, high unemployment and the slow pace of rebuilding after the war with Islamic State.
The recount delayed the process by three months but showed little had changed from the initial results, with Sadr, a populist Shi'ite cleric, retaining his lead of 54 seats. Ameri's bloc, made up of Shi'ite paramilitary groups, remained second with 48 seats. Abadi's bloc remained third with 42. Maliki's bloc came in fifth with 25 seats.
The alliance led by Sadr and Abadi that was announced on Sunday included 20 electoral lists that collectively won 187 seats, a document published by the state news agency showed. It is now in the lead position to form a government.
It includes the blocs of Vice President Ayad Allawi and Shi'ite Muslim cleric Ammar al-Hakim, as well as several Sunni Muslim lawmakers and ones representing Turkmen, Yazidi, Mandaean and Christian minorities.
Ameri and Maliki held a news conference late on Sunday to say they in fact had the largest parliamentary bloc, with 145 seats.
Neither alliance included the two main Kurdish parties, positioning them to reprise the kingmaker role they have historically played, as their combined 43 seats would give whichever alliance they join a sizable numerical advantage. 

Since Saddam Hussein was toppled in a 2003 U.S. invasion, power has been shared among Iraq's three largest ethnic-sectarian components. The prime minister is a Shi'ite Arab, the speaker of parliament a Sunni Arab and the president a Kurd.

ADEN (Reuters) - Hundreds of demonstrators protesting against Yemen's deteriorating economic situation and weakening currency blocked major roads and burned tires in the southern city of Aden on Sunday, with shops and government offices closing.
By evening, the country's internationally recognized government ordered a temporary halt on imports of luxury goods like automobiles and a 30 percent salary increase for public-sector employees, including pensioners and contractors.
The Yemeni rial has lost more than half its value against the U.S. dollar since the start of a civil war in 2015 between the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, based in the south and backed by Saudi Arabia, and the Iran-aligned Houthi movement that controls the north including the capital, Sanaa.
Soaring prices have put some basic commodities out of reach for many Yemenis and the central bank has struggled to pay public-sector salaries on which many depend as foreign exchange reserves dwindle.
Yemen is one of the poorest Arab countries and the war has pushed it toward humanitarian collapse as hunger and disease spread. The United Nations has convened talks in Geneva on Thursday, the first effort to negotiate the conflict in more than two years.
Aden's usually bustling markets were empty on Sunday after the coordinating council of the General Confederation of Southern Workers' Unions called for civil disobedience. Plumes of smoke from burning tires filled the air, including in the main square where a National Bank of Yemen building is located.
There were reports of smaller protests in nearby municipalities.
""There is no alternative to change the situation except popular revolution against corruption in all its forms,"" said one of the protesters, Fadl Ali Abdullah. ""The people have lost confidence in everything around them.""
SHARP DROP
One of the organizers said demonstrations and civil disobedience would continue daily from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. except on Fridays until the current government resigns and prices for consumer goods are reduced.
Authorities have sought to boost liquidity by printing money, but the rial plunged to 350 to the dollar from 250 after the first batch of newly printed notes was rolled out last year. It was trading at 440 to the dollar by the end of last year and declined to about 500 in January.
Saudi Arabia, which is leading a military coalition against the Houthis, then deposited $2 billion in Yemen's central bank to shore up the rial, but the currency later weakened again.
By Sunday evening, bankers and currency traders in Aden said it had dropped sharply, reaching 610 to the dollar.
Hadi, who has lived in exile in Riyadh since 2015, directed the government's economic committee to find ""effective measures and solutions to overcome the current situation,"" in comments carried by state news agency SABA.
In addition to the import ban and salary raises, the government ordered an unspecified increase in production from the Maila oilfields in Hadramout province, the export of oil from Shabwa province, and urgent measures to export gas, according to a statement tweeted by Information Minister Moammar al-Eryani.
It also said that unregistered money exchangers would be closed and government entities would need a license to deal with the foreign exchange market. 

Following the meeting, Hadi traveled to the United States to receive medical care including routine exams. The 73-year-old leader has been treated for a heart condition since 2011.

Scotland voted against independence in 2014, but a subsequent referendum on leaving the EU has reignited debate over its long-term future as one of Britain's four constituent parts alongside England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. 
In 2016, a majority of Scottish voters backed staying in the EU, while Britain as a whole, voted to leave, meaning that Britain is now due to leave the EU on March 29 2019.
The poll showed that if Britain leaves the EU as planned, 47 percent of Scots would vote for independence at another referendum on Scotland's future. That compared to 43 percent who would vote against independence and 10 percent who did not know how they would vote.
If Britain remained inside the EU and a Scottish independence referendum were held, the poll showed opinions were reversed, with 43 percent backing Scottish independence under those circumstances, compared to 47 who were against it.
The poll was conducted by Deltapoll, a member of the British Polling Council, which interviewed 1,022 Scottish voters. The poll was commissioned by Best for Britain, an body campaigning for Britain to keep an open mind on retaining its EU membership.

The British government says that the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence settled the question.

In a letter to Britain's Guardian newspaper, Ahmad Tibi, a deputy speaker of Israel's parliament, and three other members of the Joint Arab List party said Corbyn had a ""longstanding solidarity with all oppressed peoples around the world, including his unflinching support for the Palestinian people.""
Since unexpectedly becoming Labour leader in 2015 after decades spent on the left-wing fringes of the party, Corbyn has repeatedly faced accusations of turning a blind eye to anti-Semitic comments in the party and among groups he supports.
Corbyn has responded to protests by meeting Jewish community leaders, reassuring Jewish people they are welcome in the party. He has previously apologized for what he has described as ""pockets"" of anti-Semitism in his party.
Israel's own Labour party suspended relations with Corbyn in April, accusing him of sanctioning anti-Semitism and showing hostility toward Israeli policies.
In their letter, the Arab members of Israel's parliament said they recognize Corbyn as ""a principled leftist leader who aspires for peace and justice and is opposed to all forms of racism, whether directed at Jews, Palestinians, or any other group.""

Some opinion polls put Labour ahead or level with Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservatives, meaning he is a potential British leader, although the next election is not due until 2022.

268,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>",Vietnam says police arrest seven more from group accused of June police station bombing,"HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnamese state media reported that police have arrested seven more people they say belong to an exile group based in Canada that aims to overthrow the ruling Communist party. 
The arrests were the latest in a string of crackdowns by the government on local dissidents and exiled groups, including two that it designated as terrorist groups.
The official police newspaper Cong An Nhan Dan reported on Saturday that ""Trieu Dai Viet"", or Viet Dynasty, was behind a bombing of a police station in Ho Chi Minh City in June.
The incident, in which two small explosive devices were detonated, injured three people. Police said in July that they had arrested seven people in relation to the case.
Canada-based Trieu Dai Viet, with a motto to ""fire all"", ""kill all"", ""destroy all"", ""steal all"", also planned to bomb houses of some local provincial officials but were stopped by police, the newspaper reported. 
The details could not be independently confirmed by Reuters and no comment was available from the group. 
Trieu Dai Viet was founded by former key members of the California-based Provisional National Government of Vietnam, which is loyal to the now defunct state of South Vietnam, who broke away due to a conflict of ideas, the newspaper's website said.
The Provisional National Government of Vietnam was listed by Vietnam as a terrorist organization in January.
Ngo Van Hoang Hung, founder of Trieu Dai Viet, was given a life sentence in Vietnam in 1979 but fled to Canada and never returned to Vietnam. The group spreads their message through Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Youtube, the report added. 
The arrest came just before Vietnam celebrated its National Day holiday on Sept. 2 and after Vietnam ordered police and military forces in the capital Hanoi to prevent big gatherings or protests.
Earlier this week, police arrested a man accused of being a member of the Viet Tan group, which Vietnam also regards as a terrorist organization, on suspicion of planning attacks after he entered Vietnam from Cambodia with a large number of weapons.
Viet Tan, which describes itself as an ""unsanctioned pro-democracy party"", rejected the allegations and said the police are trying to scare people not to support pro-democracy organizations by falsely accusing them of smuggling weapons.

The White House said in a statement the leaders would discuss trade, investment and security cooperation in their Sept. 5 meeting.
Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah has led mediation efforts to resolve a year-long dispute between Gulf Arab neighbors after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic, trade and transport ties with Qatar.
The four countries accuse Doha of supporting terrorism and cosying up to regional foe Iran. Doha denies those charges and says the boycott is an attempt to impinge on its sovereignty.
Trump publicly sided with the Saudis and Emiratis early on in the crisis but then began pushing for a resolution to restore Gulf unity and maintain a united front against Iran.
Reuters reported in July that the administration was quietly pushing ahead with a bid to create a new security and political alliance with six Gulf Arab states, Egypt and Jordan, in part to counter Iran’s expansion in the region, citing U.S. and Arab officials.
The administration’s hope is that the effort, tentatively known as the Middle East Strategic Alliance, might be discussed at a summit provisionally scheduled for Washington on Oct. 12-13, the sources said, though the Qatar rift could present a big obstacle.

270,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>",Khamenei says war unlikely but urges boosting Iran's defenses,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Sunday war was unlikely but called on Iran's armed forces to boost their defense capacities, according to his official website, as the country faces increased tension with the United States.
On Saturday, Iran announced plans to boost its ballistic and cruise missile capacity and acquire modern fighter planes and submarines to boost its defenses following the U.S. pullout from Tehran's nuclear agreement with world powers. 
""Ayatollah Khamenei emphasized that based on political calculations there is no likelihood of a military war but added that the armed forces must be vigilant ... and raise their personnel and equipment capacities,"" the website quoted Khamenei 
as telling commanders of Iran's air defense forces.
""The Supreme Leader said ...the air defense units were a very sensitive part of the armed forces and on the front line of confronting the enemy, and emphasized the need to increase their readiness and capabilities,"" the website said in its report on the gathering, which was held to mark Iran's Air Defence Day.
Saturday's news of the military development plans came a day after Iran dismissed a French call for negotiations on Tehran's future nuclear plans, its ballistic missile arsenal and its role in wars in Syria and Yemen. 
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said last month the Islamic Republic's military prowess was what deterred Washington from attacking it.
Separately, a senior Iranian diplomat met visiting UK Junior Foreign Minister Alistair Burt and urged swift European action on a planned package of economic measures to offset the U.S. pullout from the accord and the reimpositions of sanctions by Washington, the state news agency IRNA reported.
""The imposition of (U.S.) sanctions and pressures and the lack of rapid action by Europe to fulfill their commitments will have serious consequences,"" Kamal Kharrazi, a former foreign minister who heads a top foreign policy council, told Burt, IRNA reported.
Iranian officials have said they would decide whether to quit the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers after studying the European package of economic measures that could help offset U.S. sanctions. 
""European countries have not been able yet to take necessary measures to secure Iran's interests under the nuclear agreement,"" Kharrazi said.
""(Burt) said Britain's position is different from that of the United States and we are looking for a European mechanism to make the nuclear accord successful,"" IRNA reported.
In a meeting with senior parliamentarian Heshmatollah Falahatpisheh, Burt referred to the case of a British-Iranian dual national detained in Iran, IRNA reported.
""I thank Iran for its humanitarian act to grant Nazanin Zaghari furlough and her meeting with her family, and we hope that this approach will continue until the release and the pardon of such people,"" Burt said, according to IRNA.
Britain is seeking the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation. She was arrested in April 2016 at Tehran airport as she was heading back to Britain with her daughter, now aged four, after a family visit. She was released for three days last month.
Burt, on the first visit by a British minister since U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal, earlier met Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi.
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Saturday the talks with Burt had involved ""access to banking resources and the sale of oil"".
Iran has been seeking commitment from European signatories of the nuclear deal that it will be able to access the Western banking system and continue to sell oil despite U.S. sanctions.

In a statement before his visit, Burt said: ""As long as Iran meets its commitments under the deal, we remain committed to it as we believe it is the best way to ensure a safe, secure future for the region.""

271,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2018 11:42AM ET</span>",Long reach of U.S. sanctions hits Syria reconstruction,"By Angus McDowall 
BEIRUT (Reuters) - As Syrian President Bashar al-Assad attempts to turn military success into postwar reconstruction, Western sanctions are a major obstacle that could scare off foreign companies.
Syria has suffered immense physical destruction, while millions of workers have fled, been conscripted or killed. A U.N. agency estimates the war has cost $388 billion. 
Extensive reconstruction still looks far off. Assad's allies Russia and Iran, as well as China, have made some investments in the country, but they cannot afford the cost of rebuilding and want other countries to share the burden. 
Western countries say they will not approve reconstruction funding for Syria, or drop sanctions, without a political settlement. Meanwhile, sanctions are making it hard for foreign companies to work there. 
Although some have managed to do business in Syria, the wide scope of the sanctions and broad U.S. powers to enforce them mean companies risk inadvertent breaches. 
Most Western companies are steering clear. One that hopes for future work in Syria, German pipe manufacturer Ostendorf Kunststoffe, exhibited at an international trade fair in Damascus and is building relationships with potential customers. 
However, it has not agreed any contracts yet and its local representative, Nabil Moughrabie, based in Beirut, said the company was waiting for the political climate to clear. 
""We have obstacles. There isn't any direct shipping from Germany to Syria. There are Syrian banks that cannot receive any money from Europe, and European companies that are afraid to receive any more from Syria,"" he said. 
SANCTIONS EXTENDED
U.S. sanctions on Syria predate the crisis, but were extended after Assad's crackdown on protests in 2011 and again as the country slid into war.
The sanctions have frozen the assets of the Syrian state and hundreds of companies and individuals, including government figures, military and security personnel and others accused of involvement in making or using chemical weapons. 
They ban exports, sales or supply of services, along with any new investments, into Syria by any U.S. person. They also bar any dealings by U.S. persons in Syrian oil and hydrocarbon products, or their import into the United States. 
U.S. persons cannot finance or facilitate any transactions by foreigners that would fall under sanctions if done by Americans. 
European Union sanctions were imposed in May 2011, for Syria's ""brutal repression and violation of human rights"", and have been updated several times since. 
They are not as sweeping as the U.S. sanctions, but are still extensive and include asset freezes, travel bans, trade restrictions, financial sanctions and an arms embargo. 
They bar trade in items that could be used militarily or for repression, luxury goods, precious stones and metals and equipment or technology for some oil and gas sectors including exploration and production, refining and gas liquefaction. 
The European sanctions also target Syria's electricity network, banning E.U. companies from building power plants, supplying turbines or financing such projects. 
U.S. and E.U. sanctions include exceptions for humanitarian supplies, and for items needed by United Nations missions in Syria. 
The E.U. also allows companies to carry out work in the energy and power sectors covered by contracts signed before the sanctions were imposed. 
SANCTIONS ENFORCED 
""It's not for the faint hearted,"" said Anna Bradshaw, a partner at law firm Peters & Peters in London, who advises on sanctions. 
U.S. rules pose a bigger risk to companies involved in Syria than E.U. ones, she said. 
American authorities have pursued violations more assiduously than the E.U., where enforcement may be complicated by differences among its 28 states in how to interpret rules and penalties. 
U.S. sanctions, besides being wider in scope, have a longer reach: American jurisdiction extends to the worldwide activities of all ""U.S. persons"".
That term includes both American citizens and companies, as well as U.S. permanent residents and under some sanctions programs - at present not including Syria - foreign subsidiaries of American firms. 
In April, U.S. authorities arrested a Bulgarian man working for the Bulgarian office of a U.S. company in a Syrian-related sanctions case for which three Americans were jailed in December.
Washington does not only target U.S. sanctions violators. It can also blacklist foreign companies or people who help others to skirt sanctions - naming them as foreign sanctions evaders barred from most business with Americans. 
MAIN RISKS
Non-U.S. companies risk trouble if any part of a transaction involves Americans or American companies. 
""If you do something that causes someone else who is subject to U.S. jurisdiction to violate U.S. sanctions, then you are on the hook as well,"" said Bradshaw. 
Even diligent companies might inadvertently fall foul of the asset freezes by dealing with a listed individual or entity in Syria's opaque business climate. 
That risk has grown as Assad has consolidated control, Bradshaw said: ""The people who will be commissioning the reconstruction efforts and the people in charge are likely to be the very people targeted by financial sanctions. 
""The more you can demonstrate that your due diligence is reasonable, the better chance you have of persuading the authorities that they shouldn't pursue you,"" she said, warning it may not always be possible to spot that a counterparty is sanctioned. 
Syrian Finance Minister Mamoun Hamdan told Reuters last week that the sanctions were unjust because they affected ordinary people as well as the government and army.
Despite the humanitarian exemptions, sanctions have hit Syrian healthcare, the World Health Organisation's Syria representative Elizabeth Hoff said. 

Sanctions affected procurement of some medicines by preventing transactions with foreign banks and stopping many international drug companies from dealing with Syria, she said.

272,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2018 11:40AM ET</span>",Germany suspends two policemen over Nazi salute,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Police in Germany's southern state of Bavaria are investigating two officers suspected of performing the illegal Hitler salute.
The German constitution makes it a crime to exhibit Nazi symbols and the incident is likely to feed into a heated debate about racism and the rise of the far right after a record influx of mainly Muslim migrants three years ago.
Police said in a statement on Saturday the two policemen had shouted anti-immigrant remarks and made the salute in a pub in the city of Rosenheim on Thursday. It based its information on a witness who was in the same beer garden as the two officers.
A third man, described as a security guard in the police statement, had also taken part and made the salute. The policemen have been suspended.
German politicians have been urging action to combat a rise in hostility toward foreigners after skinheads last Sunday clashed with police in an eastern city where a man was fatally stabbed and two migrants were identified as the main suspects.
Skinheads raised their arms in Nazi salutes, chased people who appeared to be outsiders and wrestled with police in Chemnitz after police identified the suspects as a Syrian and an Iraqi.
The leaking of the arrest warrant for one of the two stabbing suspects to the anti-Islam group PEGIDA raised concerns that some justice officials in the state of Saxony, where Chemnitz is located, were sympathetic to the far right.
""We will not allow the extreme right to infiltrate our society,"" Justice Minister Katarina Barley told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper on Sunday, urging authorities in Saxony to investigate far-right groups.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's liberal immigration policy remains deeply divisive in a country that has taken in more than 1.6 million people over the last four years.
The influx contributed to the rise of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which entered parliament for the first time in an election last year with a campaign that proclaimed Islam to be incompatible with the German constitution.
Some 8,000 people took part in a demonstration organized by the AfD and the anti-Islam group PEGIDA in Chemnitz on Saturday. About 3,000 people attended a rival protest by leftist groups.
Police said on Sunday that the demonstrations were largely peaceful.
Leftist groups will hold a concert in the city on Monday to denounce xenophobia and hatred against refugees and foreigners.

Alexander Zakharchenko was fatally injured in an explosion in a cafe in Donetsk on Friday. Russia's foreign ministry accused Ukraine of his murder, while Kiev blamed his death on separatist infighting.
The official media outlet of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic said 200,000 people had gathered for the funeral of Zakharchenko, the republic's leader since 2014. Reuters was unable to verify that figure.
Footage showed long queues of mourners, many carrying red carnations, lining up to pay their respects outside the city's main opera theater, where Zakharchenko's coffin stood. 
""I am here because I really respected him. He did everything for the people ... A good person is gone,"" Anna, a member of the crowd, said through tears.
A woman who described herself as Zakharchenko's former neighbor, Natalya, was also crying.
""It is such a shame, such a waste. He was everything to us ... He left, he left fighting for his country. There are no words,"" Natalya said. 
""We will not forgive this,"" she added.
His coffin, draped in the separatist region's flag and the flag of the Russian Airborne Troops, a division of Russia's armed forces, was carried out of the theater to silent applause, footage showed.
It was placed on the gun-carriage of a large artillery weapon, which was then towed past the crowds by a truck. 
""I didn't know him personally but he was a leader to all of us,"" Katya, a young woman attending the funeral, said. 
At least five other leading separatist commanders have been killed in unexplained circumstances not connected to front-line combat since the conflict started in 2014, when Russian-backed rebels threw off Ukrainian central rule in an armed uprising.
A shaky internationally-brokered ceasefire has been in force since 2015, halting large-scale fighting, but frequent outbreaks of shooting on the front line between the separatist and Ukrainian forces continue.

After seven years of civil war, the Syrian province of Idlib and surrounding areas are the last major enclave held by rebels opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, a close Russian ally. 
A source has told Reuters Assad is preparing a phased offensive to regain the province.
""The winds of war are blowing and we are receiving troubling news about the risk of a possible humanitarian catastrophe in Syria, in the province of Idlib,"" Francis told thousands of people gathered in St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ) for his weekly blessing.
""I renew my heartfelt appeal to the international community and all the actors involved to use the tools of diplomacy, dialogue and negotiation to ensure the respect of international human rights and to safeguard civilian lives,"" he added. 
A major offensive in the Idlib area, where displaced people already make up half the population, risks forcing another 700,000 Syrians from their homes, the United Nations has said.
Syria's foreign minister said on Thursday government forces would ""go all the way"" in Idlib, and that Damascus's main targets were al-Nusra militants. The minister said Syria would try to avoid civilian deaths.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday the United States viewed a military assault on Idlib as an escalation of the Syrian conflict.

""Iraq is not obliged to respond to media reports that lack tangible evidence backing up their claims and allegations,"" the ministry said in a statement.
""All state institutions in Iraq uphold Article 7 of the constitution, which prohibits the use of Iraqi land as a base or passage to be used in operations targeting the security of other states.""
Iranian, Iraqi and Western sources told Reuters that Iran had given ballistic missiles to Shi'ite proxies in Iraq and was developing the capacity to build more there.
The Iraqi government and military declined to comment at the time. In Sunday's statement, the Foreign Ministry said it was ""astonished at the allegations"" contained in the report.
Iran on Saturday rejected the report, which it said aimed to hurt Iran's ties with neighbors.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Twitter he was ""deeply concerned"" by news that Iran was transferring ballistic missiles into Iraq. He urged Iraqi leaders to form a new government quickly after a May 12 parliamentary election.
Any sign Iran is preparing a more aggressive missile policy in Iraq will exacerbate tensions between Tehran and Washington, already heightened by U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.
It would also embarrass France, Germany and Britain, the three European signatories to the nuclear deal, as they have been trying to salvage the agreement despite new U.S. sanctions against Tehran.

According to three Iranian officials, two Iraqi intelligence sources and two Western intelligence sources, Iran has transferred short-range ballistic missiles to allies in Iraq over the last few months. Five of the officials said it was helping those groups to start making their own.

276,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2018 07:21AM ET</span>","Despite Putin's concessions, Russians protest pension reform law","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Thousands of people across Russia joined protests on Sunday against government plans to raise the pension age, despite recent promises by President Vladimir Putin to soften the unpopular measure.
Sunday's protests show that the proposed policy remains a politically sensitive issue for the government despite concessions offered by Putin in a televised address on Wednesday.
During the speech, Putin took personal responsibility for the reform for the first time and described it as a financial necessity. He ended his address by asking the Russian people for their understanding.
Polls by the Levada Centre show Putin's personal approval rating has fallen around 10 percentage points since the pension reforms were proposed, although it still stands at around 70 percent. Around 9,000 people gathered 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) from the Kremlin, according to White Counter, an NGO that counts participants at rallies, but Moscow police put the numbers at 6,000.
Many carried the red flags and banners of the principal organizer of the protest, the KPRF Communist Party. 
A large banner reading ""We do not trust United Russia"", Putin's ruling party, was held up by the crowd and featured a drawing of a red fist punching the white polar bear logo of Putin's party. 
""Today we are holding an all-Russia protest against this cannibalistic reform,"" veteran Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said, addressing the crowd.
He went on to list his party's proposals for raising money for the state budget, focused on taxing Russia's so-called oligarchs, instead of raising the retirement age. 
Speakers also voiced their support for the party's candidate in the Moscow mayoral election, which will be held on Sept. 9.
A separate gathering in the city, organized by the Just Russia party attracted a further 1,500 people protesting against the pension reforms, Moscow police said. 
In his address on Wednesday, Putin watered down the draft pension reform legislation, introduced by the government on June 14, which opinion polls showed was opposed by 90 percent of Russians and which has provoked a string of protests in recent weeks. 
Putin, who was re-elected in March, offered to cut the proposed retirement age for women to 60, from a retirement age of 63 first proposed by the government. Russian women currently retire at 55. 
Putin said that the proposal to raise the pension age for men from 60 to 65 would remain unchanged. 

Protests also took place on Sunday in cities across Russia, including Siberia's Novosibirsk and Vladivostok, according to Interfax news agency.

An official in the regional alliance backing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and a Britain-based war monitor had earlier attributed the blasts to Israeli missile strikes. 
The state media cited a military source as saying there was no ""Israeli aggression"" directed at the Mezzeh airbase near Damascus, after the sound of explosions was heard across the Syrian capital. 
There was no immediate comment from Israel. 
Iran's state news agency IRNA quoted an unnamed Iranian military official based in Syria as saying that the blast was caused by ""an electrical short-circuit in an ammunition depot"" on the outskirts of Damascus. 
The official in the regional pro-Assad alliance had said the blasts were caused by Israeli missile fire from across the Golan Heights frontier between the two countries and by Syrian air defenses responding. 
A war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, also attributed the blasts to Israeli strikes, and said the blasts led to deaths and injuries.
Israel has previously acknowledged having carried out air strikes in Syria aimed at degrading the capacity of Iran and its allies, including Lebanon's Shi'ite Hezbollah group, which are backing Assad in the country's seven-year civil war. 
In May, it said it attacked nearly all of Iran’s military infrastructure in Syria after Iranian forces fired rockets at Israeli-held territory for the first time in the most extensive military exchange ever between the two adversaries.

With under two months before Britain and the EU want to agree a deal to end over 40 years of union, May is struggling to sell what she calls her business-friendly Brexit to her own party and across a divided country.
The EU has tentatively welcomed what has become known as the Chequers plan, which is designed to protect cross-border trade, but difficult negotiations lie ahead. 
""I will not be pushed into accepting compromises on the Chequers proposals that are not in our national interest,"" May wrote in the Sunday Telegraph newspaper. 
""The coming months will be critical in shaping the future of our country and I am clear about my mission.""
May also said she would not hold a second referendum on Britain's EU membership, reiterating a long-held position in an attempt to counter increasingly vocal campaigning for another public vote on the terms of the divorce.
""To ask the question all over again would be a gross betrayal of our democracy,"" May said.
May's plan would keep Britain in a free-trade zone with the EU for manufactured and agricultural goods. But some Brexit supporters have said that would mean parts of the British economy would still be subject to rules set in Brussels. 
Two of May's most senior lawmakers - Boris Johnson and David Davis - quit as foreign secretary and Brexit secretary respectively in July in protest at May's plan, saying it did not go far enough and would let down the millions of people who voted to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum. 
According to a report in the Sunday Times newspaper, leading Brexiteer lawmakers in May's party are ready to publish their own plan for Brexit ahead of the party's annual conference which begins at the end of September.
That would be designed to heap pressure on May, who needs to get any deal with Brussels through parliamentary votes in Westminster before Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29 next year.

May reiterated that Britain would be ready to leave the EU without a deal if the two sides cannot agree on the divorce terms.

KABUL (Reuters) - U.S. Army General Scott Miller assumed command of NATO forces in Afghanistan on Sunday, arriving as Washington faces growing questions over its strategy to force the Taliban into talks to end the 17-year conflict.
Miller, former commander of the U.S. military's Joint Special Operations Command, takes over at a time of mixed hope and fear for the Western-backed government in Kabul.
""To be successful, we must continually learn and adapt to the enemy and the environment,"" Miller said at a change of command ceremony at the headquarters of the NATO-led Resolute Support mission in Kabul.
""There is no room for status quo. We cannot afford to be complacent."" 
The United States is now a year into its strategy of stepping up pressure on the Taliban by increasing airstrikes and sending thousands more troops to train and advise Afghan forces, but clear signs of success have so far proved elusive.
Civilian casualties are running at record levels, there have been repeated attacks on major cities such as Kabul and Jalalabad and while the Taliban have not managed to take any major urban centers, they control large areas of the countryside.
In June, a report by the Pentagon's Lead Inspector General offered a downbeat view, saying there was little publicly available evidence that ""actions to increase pressure on the Taliban were having a significant impact.""
Afghan forces, meanwhile, are chronically understrength because of heavy casualties and high levels of desertion, and continue to face problems with organization and logistics that have long hampered their effectiveness.
Hopes of a breakthrough in achieving peace talks were raised by an unprecedented ceasefire over the Eid holiday in June but optimism was dampened by the insurgents' dramatic assault on the city of Ghazni last month.
""I believe that some of the Taliban want peace also but they are being encouraged to keep fighting,"" the outgoing commander Gen. John Nicholson said at the ceremony, urging the insurgents to listen to demands for peace from the Afghan people.
""It is time for this war in Afghanistan to end,"" he said.
LONGEST WAR 
Like Nicholson, Miller spent years in Afghanistan before assuming command of U.S. and coalition forces there and his career has followed the different stages of what is now America's longest war.
He was among the first U.S. troops to arrive in 2001 as part of the campaign to topple the Taliban following the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States.
Almost a decade later, he served during the ""surge"" ordered by President Barack Obama, which saw more than 100,000 NATO troops in Afghanistan in a bid to crush the insurgency, as well as in 2013-14 as most international troops were withdrawn.
Washington has accepted that a purely military victory is not possible and has focused on forcing the Taliban to the negotiating table.

But increasingly questions are being asked about whether the strategy is working amid reports that President Donald Trump has grown impatient with the lack of clear progress.

In a statement on its official microblog, Leiyang police in China's southern Hunan province said it detained the people for disturbing public order and damaging police facilities during the protest outside a police station late on Saturday.
People angry about the difficulty of enrolling their children at public schools protested near six schools and a government building and blocked roads, police said.
The protesters aired grievances to Leiyang mayor Li Xiangyang at the government building before moving onto the police station where projectiles were thrown, injuring over 30 officers and damaging vehicles, police said.
Of the 46 people detained, only one was a parent of school-age children, police said.
The Leiyang Education Bureau did not answer telephone calls from Reuters seeking comment outside of regular business hours on Sunday.

TAOS, N.M. (Reuters) - A 13-year-old boy who was part of group taken into custody at a squalid New Mexico compound last month has told FBI agents his mother's boyfriend was training him to conduct ""jihad"" against non-believers, according to federal court documents.
The boy was among 11 children and five adults living at the compound in Taos County when it was raided on Aug. 3 by local sheriff's deputies who discovered a cache of firearms and the children living without food or clean water. The dead body of a three-year-old boy was found buried at the site later.
They initially faced state charges, then on Friday, the five adults including a Haitian woman described as the group's leader, 35-year-old Jany Leveille, were arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and accused of conspiracy and firearms offenses.
In an affidavit filed in support of a criminal complaint, an FBI special agent wrote that Leveille's 13-year-old son told investigators that his mother's boyfriend, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, 40, wanted to ""get an army together"" and train them for jihad.
The boy told agents that Ibn Wahhaj trained him and another of Leveille's teenage sons in firearms and military techniques, including rapid reloads and hand-to-hand combat, and told them jihad meant killing non-believers on behalf of Allah, according to the affidavit filed in U.S. District Court in New Mexico.
The 13-year-old also told the FBI that his mother believed she received messages from God, and that he watched her and Ibn Wahhaj perform supposed ""exorcism"" rituals over the three-year-old boy, including one during which the boy choked and his heart stopped, according to the special agent's affidavit.
The teenager said his mother and others at the compound told him not to talk to anyone about the three-year-old ever being at the compound because they would ""all go to jail.""
Defense lawyers have said that the five adults were exercising their constitutional rights to practice their religion and own firearms, and that the group is being discriminated against because they are black and Muslim. The defense attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment on Saturday.
The five defendants came under FBI surveillance in May after Leveille wrote a letter to Ibn Wahhaj's brother asking him to join them and become a ""martyr,"" state prosecutors have said.

They are due to appear in court in Albuquerque on Tuesday.

BANGKOK, (Reuters) - Governments are not on track to meet a goal of the 2015 Paris agreement of capping temperatures well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) before the end of the century, a United Nations official said on Sunday ahead of climate-change talks in Bangkok this week.
Patricia Espinosa, head of the Executive Secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which steers the climate talks, said both the public and private sector need to act with urgency to avoid ""catastrophic effects"".
The Paris climate agreement, adopted by almost 200 nations in 2015, set a goal of limiting warming to ""well below"" a rise of 2 degrees C above pre-industrial times while ""pursuing efforts"" for the tougher goal of 1.5 degrees C.
""1.5 is the goal that is needed for many islands and many countries that are particularly vulnerable to avoid catastrophic effects. In many cases it means the survival of those countries. With the pledges we have on the table now we are not on track to achieve those goals,"" Espinosa told Reuters in a telephone interview on Sunday in Bangkok.
A Europe-wide heat wave this summer and bush fires in Australia, among other things, should give new impetus to the talks, said Espinosa.
""It really does make the evidence clear that climate change is having an impact on the daily lives of people,"" Espinosa said.
""I do believe that this will create a bigger sense of urgency.""
The Bangkok talks come ahead of a December meeting in Katowice, Poland, where government ministers will meet to agree rules for the 2015 Paris climate accord.
That accord set a sweeping goal of ending the fossil fuel era this century, but the text was vague on details.
Espinosa said she hopes that a draft text for negotiation on the ""rule book"" of the 2015 agreement will emerge at the end of the week-long Bangkok talks.
""These draft texts that we hope can emerge from these talks here in Bangkok are something that we need to build on from the talks in Paris 2015. This is a process that has been ongoing for some time. One of the reasons why this is so complex is because we are talking about ... many different areas. One of those areas that countries need to take action on is to reduce their emissions,"" she said.
A promise by rich nations to provide developing nations with $100 billion a year to tackle climate change is only one part of the huge transformation needed, she added.

""There is a clear view that the $100 billion is only one part of the broad transformation of our societies that we are talking about... There is also a need to mobilize private financing,"" said Espinosa.

The rare concession follows mounting international pressure, including from allies, to do more to limit civilian casualties in a 3-1/2 year civil war that has killed more than 10,000 people and pushed the already impoverished country to the brink of famine.
The Western-backed alliance fighting the Iranian-aligned Houthi group in Yemen said at the time that the Aug. 9 air strikes at a market in Saada province had targeted missile launchers used to attack southern Saudi Arabia a day earlier and accused the Houthis of using children as human shields.
The Joint Incident Assessment Team (JIAT), an investigative body set up by the coalition, said on Saturday that the strikes had been based on intelligence indicating the bus was carrying Houthi leaders, a legitimate military target, but delays in executing the strike and receiving a no-strike order should be further investigated.
""There was a clear delay in preparing the fighter jet at the appropriate time and place, thus losing (the opportunity) to target this bus as a military target in an open area in order to avoid such collateral damage,"" JIAT legal advisor Mansour Ahmed al-Mansour told reporters in the Saudi capital.
""The team believes that the coalition forces should immediately review the application of their rules of engagement to ensure compliance,"" he added.
The coalition later announced that it accepted those findings and pledged to hold accountable anyone who was proven to have made a mistake.
""The Joint Forces Command of the Coalition expresses regret over the mistakes, extends its sympathies, condolences and solidarity to the families of the victims,"" said a statement carried by the Saudi state news agency SPA.
The coalition said it would coordinate with the Yemeni government to compensate victims and would continue reviewing the rules of engagement to prevent the repeat of such incidents.
The U.S. military welcomed the decision and said it appreciated the coalition's decision ""to take legal measures to ensure accountability and make the necessary improvements to its Rules of Engagement to prevent such a tragedy in the future.""
""The #DoD welcomes the #Saudi-led #Coalition’s announcement of the investigation findings of the targeting incident of August 9, 2018,"" Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said in a series of tweets on Saturday. 
Last week, a U.N. panel of human rights experts said that some coalition air strikes may constitute war crimes. In Washington, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition was not unconditional, but suggested the United States would continue to support the alliance as it works to reduce fallout on civilians.
The war has so far garnered relatively little public attention in Western countries, but there are signs that is starting to change, particularly because of the role Western governments play in supplying arms to the coalition countries.
Saudi Arabia is leading an alliance of Sunni Muslim Arab states trying to restore the internationally recognized government of Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, ousted from the capital, Sanaa, by the Houthis in 2015.
The Houthis, who control the capital and most of the west of the country, regularly fire missiles on southern Saudi Arabia and occasionally aim for higher-value targets, such as the capital Riyadh or facilities of state oil company Aramco.

The United Nations has convened talks in Geneva on Sept. 6, the first effort to negotiate the war in more than two years.

MAIDUGURI (Reuters) - Islamist militants have killed up to 30 soldiers in an attack on a military base in northeast Nigeria, security sources said on Saturday, in one of the biggest attacks of its kind this year. 
Thursday's attack by suspected members of Islamic State in West Africa (ISWA) was on a base in Zari village in the north of Borno State.
In 2016 ISWA split from Boko Haram, the jihadist group which has killed more than 30,000 people in the region since 2009, when it launched an insurgency to create an Islamic caliphate.
The Zari attack highlights the challenge to secure the northeast, months ahead of a February election in which security looks set to be a campaign issue. 
""The battle lasted for about two hours and our colleagues fought them but things became bad before the fighter jets arrived. We lost about 30 of our soldiers and about 10 were wounded,"" said a military source who did not want to be named.
Another, who also did not want to be named, said 20 to 30 troops had been killed in a surprise attack. Details only emerged days later because it occurred in a remote area near the border with Niger. 
The attack, in the Guzamala local government area of Borno, is the latest blow to Nigeria's efforts to defeat insurgencies by Boko Haram and ISWA. 
Earlier this week Reuters reported that Nigerian government officials had ordered thousands of displaced people to return to Guzamala, an area considered by aid agencies to be unsafe, as pressure mounts to show progress in the war against the insurgents ahead of the presidential election. 
President Muhammadu Buhari, a former general, won the 2015 election after vowing to crush Islamist militants. He plans to seek a second term in February. 
In July the fourth commander in 14 months was named to lead the fight against the militants after a number of embarrassing defeats, despite the government having said since late 2015 that the Islamists in the region had been defeated.
And 20 Nigerian soldiers went missing in mid-July following a clash with militants in the Bama area of Borno. Military sources say the troops are feared dead.

The federal attorney general's office (PGR) and Javier Corral, governor of the northern state of Chihuahua, said the judge had thrown out the case against Alejandro Gutierrez, a onetime PRI finance official who was arrested late last year.
Chihuahua state prosecutors under Corral accused Gutierrez of diverting some 250 million pesos ($13 million) intended for education into PRI campaign coffers in 2016, creating a major scandal ahead of Mexico's July 1, 2018, presidential election.
Discontent over a string of political corruption scandals helped consign the PRI to a record defeat in the election. The party will exit government at the end of November.
Gutierrez rejected the accusations against him. Lawyers for him could not immediately be reached for comment on Saturday.
In a statement, the PGR said the judge made his ruling on Gutierrez late on Friday after federal investigators concluded there was not enough evidence to pursue the case.
Corral, a member of the opposition National Action Party and staunch opponent of the PRI, condemned the decision, saying it was a fresh blow in the fight against corruption.
""The Gutierrez case shows the degree to which the pursuit and administration of justice has deteriorated morally and institutionally in Mexico,"" Corral said on Twitter.
The PGR said Corral still had the right to appeal.

CHEMNITZ, Germany (Reuters) - German police in the eastern city of Chemnitz on Saturday halted a march by far-right groups protesting last weekend's fatal stabbing of a man, allegedly by two migrants, after a few dozen anti-fascist demonstrators tried to barge toward the crowd.
Some 6,000 supporters of the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and the anti-Islam PEGIDA group were stopped by riot police near a massive bust of Karl Marx in the city center, prompting angry shouts of ""Resistance!""
Thousands had earlier joined a rival demonstration in Chemnitz organized by leftist groups who accuse the AfD and PEGIDA of exploiting the stabbing of the 35-year-old German man to stoke hatred against migrants and refugees.
Skinheads clashed with police in Chemnitz soon after a Syrian and an Iraqi were identified as the main suspects in the killing, exposing bitter divisions over Chancellor Angela Merkel's liberal immigration policy.
On Saturday, riot police chased black-clad anti-fascist protesters who had tried to make their way toward the far-right crowd whose members waved the German flag, sang the national anthem and shouted, ""Merkel must go!""
Soon after, dozens of far-right protesters ignored police orders to stay put and made their way past a line of police cars blocking a major street in the city centre to prevent the rival marches from crossing paths.
Riot police were seen making arrests, but the tense standoff ended without violence, keeping the police's truck-mounted water cannon dry.
Merkel's decision in 2015 to welcome a million people seeking asylum, mainly Muslims from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, has dramatically changed Germany's political and social landscape.
The AfD, which says Islam is incompatible with the German constitution, entered the national parliament for first time in an election last year, securing third place after stealing voters from Merkel's conservatives.
After the stabbing in Chemnitz, AfD leaders said the far-right riots that followed were understandable. 
Images of skinheads raising their arms in Nazi salutes, chasing anyone they saw as outsiders and wrestling with riot police shocked many Germans.
The leaking of the arrest warrant for one of the two stabbing suspects to PEGIDA raised concerns that some justice officials in the state of Saxony, where Chemnitz is located, were sympathetic to the far right.
SPECIAL DUTY
Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, whose center-left Social Democrats (SPD) hold the mayor's office in Chemnitz and helped organize Saturday's leftist march, said on Twitter that Germans had a special duty to stand up against any form of fascism.
""When people are once again roaming our streets with the Hitler salute, our history mandates us to stand up for democracy,"" he wrote.
Grievances over Merkel's liberal immigration policy are stronger in the east of Germany, where unemployment is higher and anti-immigrant attitudes are more common than in the west.
Merkel, who on Friday wrapped up a three-day visit to Africa, has not yet commented on the events in Chemnitz, near the Czech border. 
""Where is she? Traveling in Africa,"" said a grey-haired man addressing the anti-immigrant crowd. ""She should come here and face us citizens.""
At the counter-demonstration across town, a woman in her 50s who declined to give her name asked: ""Who was the stabbing victim? The far right is exploiting his death by saying: 'A German has been murdered.' But he was an anti-fascist and people outside the city don't know that.""
German police have said little about the man and the circumstances surrounding his death.

As both demonstrations started to disperse, the Saxony police wrote on its Twitter account: ""The overwhelming majority are behaving peacefully. For those looking for trouble we say that we remain heavily deployed in the city and we repeat our request: stay peaceful!""

Black-clad protesters marched with banners, flags and balloons with the faces of the two jailed Reuters journalists - Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo - printed on them. 
They chanted: ""The right to know the news! The people's right! The people's right!"" 
Some carried banners that read ""Immediately release imprisoned journalists. Immediately release them.""   
A Yangon court is on Monday expected to hand down the verdict in the case against Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, who have been charged under the colonial-era Official Secrets Act.
Press freedom advocates, the United Nations, the European Union and countries including the United States, Canada and Australia have called for the Reuters journalists' acquittal.
Myo Myint Maung, Permanent Secretary for the Ministry of Information told Reuters by phone: ""No matter what side you are on, freedom of the press is important."" 
""In the current situation, you can say that we have it (freedom of the press), but there may also be things that we can improve on."" 
Government spokesman Zaw Htay has in the past said of the case against Wa Lone and Kyaw So Oo that Myanmar's courts are independent and the case will be conducted according to the law.  
At the time of their arrest, the reporters had been working on an investigation into the killings of 10 Rohingya Muslim men and boys in a village in western Myanmar’s Rakhine State.

The killings took place during an army crackdown that United Nations agencies say sent over 700,000 people fleeing to Bangladesh.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Twitter he was ""deeply concerned"" by the reports that Iran was transferring ballistic missiles into Iraq. He urged Iraqi leaders to quickly form a new government after a May 12 parliamentary election. 
""Such false and ridiculous news have no purpose other than affecting Iran's foreign relations, especially with its neighbors,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said, according to IRNA. 
Iranian, Iraqi and Western sources told Reuters that Iran has given ballistic missiles to Shi'ite proxies in Iraq and is developing the capacity to build more there.
""This news is solely aimed at creating fears in the countries of the region,"" Qassemi added.
Pompeo, in his tweet on the reports of the transfer of the missiles, said, ""If true, this would be a gross violation of Iraqi sovereignty and of UNSCR 2231.""
He was referring to U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231, which underpinned the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iraq and six world powers. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the deal earlier this year and his administration is currently reimposing sanctions against Tehran.
Earlier, Pompeo spoke by phone with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi ""to reaffirm U.S. support for Iraq's efforts to form a modern, nationalist Iraqi government,"" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement. 
Pompeo emphasized the importance of safeguarding Iraq's sovereignty during this critical time, she said.
He also spoke to Iraqi Vice President Ayad Allawi to discuss political developments and relations between Baghdad and Erbil, the capital of the semi-autonomous Kurdish region in north Iraq, Nauert added. 
Any sign that Iran is preparing a more aggressive missile policy in Iraq will exacerbate tensions between Tehran and Washington, already heightened by Trump's decision to pull out of the 2015 nuclear deal.
It would also embarrass France, Germany and Britain, the three European signatories to the nuclear deal, as they have been trying to salvage the agreement despite the new U.S. sanctions against Tehran.

According to three Iranian officials, two Iraqi intelligence sources and two Western intelligence sources, Iran has transferred short-range ballistic missiles to allies in Iraq over the last few months. Five of the officials said it was helping those groups to start making their own.

Eight Turkish commandos are seeking asylum in Greece after commandeering a helicopter to flee Turkey following a failed coup attempt against President Tayyip Erdogan in July 2016.
Turkey describes the fugitives as criminals involved in the coup plot, and has demanded that Greece hand them back. Greek courts have so far rejected Ankara's requests.
""The situation in our relations today is not to the benefit of our countries. Building trust is important. We should open a new chapter in our relations,"" Mevlut Cavusoglu told Ta Nea newspaper in an interview released on Saturday.
""We should continue the process of bilateral talks without any conditions. This is the way to solve our problems.""
He repeated demands, however, for the eight commandos to be sent to Turkey to face trial.
""The Greek justice system, contrary to the rules and the principles of the international law, is letting the culprits go unpunished and is violating the victims' rights,"" Cavusoglu was quoted as saying.
""We remain determined in our effort to make sure that the fugitive coup perpetrators will be extradited and stand trial in Turkey,"" he added.
Long-time regional rivals, the two neighbors have been at odds over a host of issues from ethnically divided Cyprus to rights in the Aegean Sea.
Rhetoric on both sides in recent months has taken a marked turn for the worse, particularly after the collapse of peace talks in Cyprus in July 2017.
The European Union depends on Turkey to keep a tight lid on immigration from the Middle East, where the war in Syria has killed hundreds of thousands and pushed millions from homes.
Under a 2016 deal, Ankara has to take back all migrants and refugees, including Syrians, who cross to Greece illegally across the sea. In return, the EU has to take in thousands of Syrian refugees directly from Turkey and reward it with more money, early visa-free travel and faster progress in EU membership talks.
Cavusoglu said Turkey respected the deal and that the EU should now keep its promises, including granting the visa-free travel, extending a second three billion-euro tranche for the Syrian refugees and making progress on EU accession talks.

Bosnia had not been on the well-trodden migrant route through the Balkans to European Union nations until earlier this year when arrivals jumped. About 11,000 people from Asia and North Africa have been registered as arriving so far this year.
Still recovering from a devastating war in the 1990s, Bosnia was bypassed in 2015 and 2016 when more than a million migrants and refugees passed through the Balkans. But as borders have closed elsewhere, Bosnia has become a new transit route.
""Migrants are crossing the River Drina (the border between Serbia and Bosnia). They pay between 250 and 300 euros to smugglers to take them over the Drina,"" said a police source who asked not to be named.
The cargo train carrying coal was stopped near the Bosnian border town of Zvornik on the banks of the River Drina. As the train was brought to a halt, some of the migrants onboard jumped out and started running, some back to Serbia, said a Reuters photographer who witnessed the operation. 
A group remained on the train and were then turned back to Serbia, the photographer and police said. Local police did not give further details.
Migrants and asylum seekers, most of them from Afghanistan, Iran, Syria and Pakistan, reach Serbia via Albania and Montenegro, according to Bosnian authorities. 
Some go to beaches on the Serbian side pretending to be tourists and then swim to the Bosnian side, the police source said. They then walk west to try to cross into the EU member Croatia.
But with Croatian police increasing border patrols and turning back migrants, around 5,000 remain stranded around in Bosnia.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Palestinian refugees reacted with dismay on Saturday to a United States decision to halt funding to a U.N. agency, warning that it would lead to more poverty, anger and instability in the Middle East. 
The U.S. announcement on Friday that it will no longer support the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) has deepened a cash crisis at the agency, and heightened tensions with the Palestinian leadership.
The 68-year-old UNRWA provides services to about 5 million Palestinian refugees across Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the West Bank and Gaza. Most are descendants of the roughly 700,000 Palestinians who were driven out of their homes or fled the fighting in the 1948 war that led to Israel's creation.
In Gaza, Nashat Abu El-Oun, a refugee and father of eight, said: ""The situation is bad and it will become worse...People can hardly afford living these days and if they became unable to earn their living they will begin thinking of unlawful things."" 
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said on Friday that UNRWA's business model and fiscal practices were an ""irredeemably flawed operation"" and that the agency's ""endlessly and exponentially expanding community of entitled beneficiaries is simply unsustainable.""
UNRWA rejected the criticisms, with spokesman Chris Gunness describing it as ""a force for regional stability.""
Speaking in Jordan, where more than 2 million registered Palestinian refugees live, including 370,000 in ten refugee camps, Gunness said: ""It is a deeply regrettable decision...some of the most disadvantaged, marginalized and vulnerable people on this planet are likely to suffer."" 
Gunness said UNRWA provides health clinics, schooling for 526,000 refugee children across Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and food assistance to 1.7 million people - a million of them in Gaza.
The agency will now ask existing donors for more money, and seek new sources of income. 
""Our funding gap is $217 million ... so although we have opened up our schools just this week we have made it clear that we only have money until the end of September,"" he said.
BIGGEST DONOR 
The United States, by far UNRWA's biggest donor, slashed funding earlier this year, paying out only $60 million of a first installment in January, and withholding $65 million. It had promised $365 million for the whole year.
Washington said the agency needed to make unspecified reforms and called on the Palestinians to renew peace talks with Israel.
The last Palestinian-Israeli peace talks collapsed in 2014, partly because of Israel's opposition to an attempted unity pact between the Fatah and Hamas Palestinian factions and to Israeli settlement building on occupied land that Palestinians seek for a state.
There was no immediate comment from the Israeli government to the decision by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, which was issued during the Jewish sabbath. But it was welcomed by some Israelis.
Israeli opposition lawmaker Yair Lapid said on Twitter: ""Aside from providing cover to terror, UNRWA is responsible for the fact that the 750,000 people they registered originally (most of whom have since died) became 5.5 million fake refugees. UNRWA lost sight of its purpose long ago.""
Earlier this year Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged action against UNRWA.
""We already have great-great-grandchildren of refugees who are not refugees,"" he said in January. ""I suggest a gradual conversion of all funds going to UNRWA to other agencies to deal with the question of refugees.""
On Friday, before the U.S. decision was confirmed, the head of the international U.N. refugee agency UNHCR, Filippo Grandi, was asked by reporters in Beirut if his agency could assume UNRWA's role. ""The Palestinian refugees in the region are the responsibility of UNRWA,"" he said, making no further comment.
The UNRWA move is the latest in a number of actions by the Trump administration that have alienated the Palestinians, including the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and the decision to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
That move was a reversal of longtime U.S. policy and led Palestinian leadership to boycott the Washington peace efforts led by Jared Kushner, Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law.
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat on Saturday accused Washington of implementing the agenda of ""Israeli extremists who have done nothing but to destroy the prospect of peace between Palestinians and Israelis.""
Speaking in Ramallah, he said: ""The United States may have the right to say that we don't want to give taxpayers' money, but who gave the U.S. the right to approve the stealing of my land, my future, my aspirations, my capital, my Aqsa Mosque, my Holy Sepulchre Church?""
In Jalazone refugee camp near Ramallah in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Ayoub Abeidi, whose family once lived in what is now the city of Lod in Israel, said the decision was political.
""Trump wants to finish off UNRWA so he can terminate the right of refugees (to return),"" said Abeidi, 53. ""Our right to return exists and neither Trump nor anybody else can cancel it.""
Successive Israeli government have ruled out any right of return, fearing the country would lose its Jewish majority.

The explosion in Azaz was caused by a car bomb, said the war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, and hit a sit-in to demand new elections to the local council, the witness said. 
The Observatory said one person was killed and others injured. The witness said two were killed and 25 injured. 
Turkey has staged two incursions into northern Syria since 2016 in support of rebels fighting President Bashar al-Assad, leading to its control over a zone along the border. 
It took that territory after offensives against the two mutually hostile groups that previously controlled it: Islamic State and the Kurdish YPG militia. 
Ankara has brought together some of the rebel groups it backs there into a unified armed force, which it trains and pays. It also pays for some services inside the area it controls. 
Northern Syria has become a haven for large numbers of displaced people who have sought refuge from fighting elsewhere in the country, or who do not want to live under Assad. 

Damascus has mobilized forces for an expected offensive on the adjacent rebel-held area in and around Idlib province, which humanitarian agencies have warned could spark a new flood of displacement toward the border region.

Britain and other European signatories are trying to keep the nuclear deal alive, despite Trump's reimposition of sanctions on Tehran.
Junior Foreign Minister Alistair Burt met Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, the state television reported
""The talks mainly covered economic cooperation and mechanisms of financial and monetary dealings between the two countries after the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear accord,"" the television report said.

In a statement before his visit, Burt said: ""As long as Iran meets its commitments under the deal, we remain committed to it as we believe it is the best way to ensure a safe, secure future for the region."" 
Burt was also expected to discuss the cases of dual nationals detained in Iran.

305,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2018 05:38AM ET</span>",U.S. halts funding to U.N. agency helping Palestinian refugees,"By Lesley Wroughton and Ali Sawafta
WASHINGTON/RAMALLAH (Reuters) - The United States on Friday halted all funding to a U.N. agency that helps Palestinian refugees in a decision further heightening tensions between the Palestinian leadership and the Trump administration.
A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas denounced the decision as ""a flagrant assault against the Palestinian people and a defiance of U.N. resolutions.""
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the business model and fiscal practices of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) made it an ""irredeemably flawed operation.""
""The administration has carefully reviewed the issue and determined that the United States will not make additional contributions to UNRWA,"" she said in a statement.
Nauert said the agency's ""endlessly and exponentially expanding community of entitled beneficiaries is simply unsustainable and has been in crisis mode for many years.""
The latest announcement comes a week after the administration said it would redirect $200 million in Palestinian economic support funds for programs in the West Bank and Gaza.
UNRWA spokesman Chris Gunness voiced the agency's ""deep regret and disappointment"" at the decision, which he said was surprising given that a December U.S. funding agreement had acknowledged UNRWA's successful management.
""We reject in the strongest possible terms the criticism that UNRWA's schools, health centers, and emergency assistance programs are 'irredeemably flawed,'"" Gunness added in a series of Twitter posts.
The 68-year-old agency says it provides services to about 5 million Palestinian refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the West Bank and Gaza. Most are descendants of people who were driven out of their homes or fled the fighting in the 1948 war that led to Israel's creation.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his aides say they want to improve the Palestinians' plight, as well as start negotiations on an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.
But under Trump, Washington has taken a number of actions that have alienated the Palestinians, including the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. That move was a reversal of longtime U.S. policy and led the Palestinian leadership to boycott the Washington peace efforts being led by Jared Kushner, Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law.
The United States paid out $60 million to UNRWA in January, withholding another $65 million, from a promised $365 million for the year.
""NOT PART OF THE SOLUTION""
""Such a punishment will not succeed to change the fact that the United States no longer has a role in the region and that it is not a part of the solution,"" Abbas spokesman Nabil Abu Rdainah told Reuters.
He said ""neither the United States nor anybody else will be able to dissolve"" UNRWA.
In Gaza, the Islamist group Hamas condemned the U.S move as a ""grave escalation against the Palestinian people.""
""The American decision aims to wipe out the right of return and is a grave U.S escalation against the Palestinian people,"" said Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri.
He told Reuters the ""U.S leadership has become an enemy of our people and of our nation and we will not surrender before such unjust decisions.""
Earlier on Friday, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Germany would increase its contributions to UNRWA because the funding crisis was fueling uncertainty. ""The loss of this organization could unleash an uncontrollable chain reaction,"" Maas said.
UNRWA has faced a cash crisis since the United States, long its biggest donor, slashed funding earlier this year, saying the agency needed to make unspecified reforms and calling on the Palestinians to renew peace talks with Israel.
The last Palestinian-Israeli peace talks collapsed in 2014, partly because of Israel's opposition to an attempted unity pact between the Fatah and Hamas Palestinian factions and Israeli settlement building on occupied land that Palestinians seek for a state.
Nauert said the United States would intensify talks with the United Nations, the region's governments and international stakeholders that could involve bilateral U.S. assistance for Palestinian children.
""We are very mindful of and deeply concerned regarding the impact upon innocent Palestinians, especially school children, of the failure of UNRWA and key members of the regional and international donor community to reform and reset the UNRWA way of doing business,"" she said.
Gunness told Reuters earlier in August that UNRWA's support would be needed as long as the parties failed to reach an agreement to end the crisis.

""UNRWA does not perpetuate the conflict, the conflict perpetuates UNRWA,"" he said. ""It is the failure of the political parties to resolve the refugee situation which perpetuates the continued existence of UNRWA.""

""I can now confirm that Hon. Bobi Wine ... is on a KLM flight out of Entebbe Airport,"" lawyer Nicholas Opiyo wrote on Twitter late on Friday, without giving his final destination.

Kyagulanyi has been charged with treason over his alleged role in the stoning of Museveni’s convoy this month, but a court granted him access to private doctors citing health concerns. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
The lawmaker has said he was beaten up and tortured while in detention. Police say they are investigating the allegations.

Protests erupted in the Ugandan capital on Friday after police detained Kyagulanyi at the international airport during his previous attempt to travel abroad for medical care.

ADDIS ABABA/BEIJING (Reuters) - Ethiopia has been lauded by experts from China's ruling Communist Party as a ""model country"" in Beijing's $126 billion Belt and Road initiative to build rail, road and sea links tying China to Eurasia and Africa.
    But as the Horn of Africa nation of 100 million people faces debt distress, there are signs that China, a major creditor, is slowing financing to Ethiopia as doubts grow over the profitability of some infrastructure projects there.
""The intensifying repayment risks from the Ethiopian government's debt reaching 59 percent of GDP is worrying investors,"" China's mission to the African Union in Addis Ababa said on its website in July.
It said that Chinese investment in the country was cooling and that the China Export and Credit Insurance Corp was reducing the scale of its investment there.
Against a backdrop of rising worry over African indebtedness to China, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed will visit Beijing for the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), which starts on Monday.
He is due to meet Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang and is expected to court investment from Chinese firms into Ethiopia's agro-industrial and pharmaceutical businesses, China's Xinhua news agency said.
Ethiopia has been a top destination for Chinese loans in Africa, despite its lack of natural resources, with state policy banks extending it more than $12.1 billion since 2000, according to the China Africa Research Initiative (CARI) at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington (SAIS). 
The country's ruling EPRDF coalition, in power since ousting a military junta in 1991, aims for Ethiopia to reach middle income status by 2025 and is pursuing ambitious manufacturing-led industrialization that has involved building roads, a railway, and industrial parks - as well as mounting debt.
Ethiopian Central Bank Governor Yinager Dessie told Reuters in July that the government hopes to reduce its debt with China, which he said holds most of Ethiopia's bilateral foreign debt.
    ""We will have some discussions in the months ahead. I don't exactly know where that discussion will take us in terms of seeing or looking for diversified options for debt repayment,"" Dessie said.
    
RAILWAY BLUES
China's concern over the profitability of some of the transport projects it is backing in landlocked Ethiopia has focused on a standard-guage railway connecting Addis Ababa to the port of Djibouti. 
    ""The sustainability of the projects is weak,"" Zhao Lei, a professor at the Central Party School in Beijing, wrote in the party-run Guangming Daily in June, pointing to a Chinese-funded light railway around the capital Addis Ababa and the Ethiopia-Djibouti rail project. 
He said there had been ""insufficient consideration of the additional infrastructure and the service and maintenance"".
    The main section of the railway opened in 2016, but Chinese financing for a northern extension, from Woldia to Mekele, has suffered multiple delays and the full funding package from the Chinese Export and Import Bank has not been released yet, according to Tang Xiaoyang, a professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing who does fieldwork in Ethiopia.
    The main concern causing delays is the economic sustainability and feasibility of the project, he said.
    China's ExIm bank and the China Communications Construction Company did not respond to faxed requests for comment.
    ""ExIm has become more risk-averse for new projects,"" said Yunnan Chen, a researcher at the China Africa Research Initiative at SAIS.
Ethiopia is likely hoping for a breakthrough on the project at the China-Africa forum, she said.

""These breakthroughs are a part of FOCAC where the publicity of the event makes it a good opportunity for African countries like Ethiopia to get pledges from China.""

308,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2018 02:20AM ET</span>","In Israel visit, Philippines' Duterte dogged by past rhetoric","By Martin Petty and Dan Williams
MANILA/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - When Rodrigo Duterte makes the first visit to Israel by a president of the Philippines next week, officials on both sides will try to play down his record of jarring invective while promoting commercial and military ties.
Israel sees the four-day tour by Duterte and his top ministers as a chance to thank Manila for taking in Jews during the Holocaust and backing the Israeli independence campaign that followed. 
Tourism, labour and defence deals are also on the agenda, cementing relationships between the Asian power and booming Israel, both historical U.S. allies.
Yet Israel's Government Press Office has said most of the visit will be closed to the media, an apparent precaution against faux pas by a president whose two-fisted crime-fighting tactics and rhetoric have raised hackles at home and abroad. 
Some Israeli pundits have recoiled at his planned attendance at Holocaust commemorations.
In 2016, in a bungled reference to an opponent’s remark that his rise could be like that of Adolf Hitler, Duterte said he himself would be “happy to slaughter” drug addicts on the scale of the Nazi leader's Jewish genocide.
    While Duterte apologised for that, he has been dogged by accusations from activists that thousands of killings in his ongoing war on drugs were executions, which he rejects, and is rebuked by women’s groups for remarks that make light of rape. 
In June, Duterte called God “stupid” and has lashed out repeatedly at the Catholic church, deeming it hypocritical. His visit will include sight-seeing in Jerusalem's walled Old City, which houses major Christian, Jewish and Muslim shrines.
""There's just no knowing what he will say from one moment to the next, so both sides want to keep this (Israel) visit as low-key as possible,"" one official involved in the planning, and who asked not to be identified by name or nationality, told Reuters.
TAKING CARE
Aides say Duterte hopes to regulate labour relations with Israel, where between 24,000 and 28,000 Filipinos work, mostly as care-givers, and to promote Holy Land tourism from the predominantly Catholic Asian country which has been growing by 30 percent to 50 percent annually in recent years. 
Establishing a direct air connection between Israel and the Philippines is in discussion.
Duterte also wants to improve security cooperation with Israel, which has sold the Philippines three radar systems and 100 armoured vehicles, and which Manila is now eyeing for an aircraft deal. According to Israeli government data, exports to the Philippines were worth $143 million last year.
Duterte, who has kept domestic opinion on edge by hankering for retirement before his term ends in 2022, makes no secret of his personal disdain for Washington and its foreign policy. 
Still, he shares Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's rapport with U.S. President Donald Trump. That has stirred modest hope in Israel that the maverick Asian leader might use his visit to announce recognition of Jerusalem as the country's capital, as Trump did last December, outraging the Palestinians. 
""We have been encouraging the Philippines on this (Jerusalem recognition), as we do with all countries,"" one Israeli diplomat said. ""We don't know that Duterte will do it - but neither do we know that he won't.""
Ernesto Abella, an official with the Foreign Ministry in Manila and a former Duterte spokesman, said the issue of moving the Philippine embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, as the United States did in May, had not been discussed. 
Abella said the controversy around Duterte's Hitler comments had been settled ""way back"".
The Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem said in a statement that Israel ""assign(s) great importance to this visit, which symbolises the strong, warm ties between our peoples as well as the enormous potential for developing and strengthening the relations"".

Duterte arrives in Israel on Sunday and on Wednesday departs for neighbouring Jordan.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China is not putting any pressure on self-ruled Taiwan's last diplomatic ally in Africa, the Kingdom of eSwatini, to switch to Beijing, but believes it is just a matter of time before that happens, a senior Chinese diplomat said on Saturday.
China has become increasingly vocal about its desire to win away the country, formerly known as Swaziland, from Taiwan, even as the eSwatini government has denounced Beijing for playing ""mind games"" and says it has no desire to ditch Taipei.
eSwatini will be the only African country not represented at a major summit between China and the continent opening in Beijing next week, where President Xi Jinping is likely to offer new loans and aid for Africa.
Speaking at a news briefing, China's special envoy for Africa, Xu Jinghu, said the issue of eSwatini and its lack of ties to Beijing was ""an important question"", but it was up to them to take the initiative.
""On this issue we won't exert any pressure. We'll wait for the time to be right,"" Xu said. ""I believe this day will come sooner or later."" 
Taiwan, which China claims as a wayward province with no right to state-to-state relations, now has formal ties with only 17 countries, many of them small, less developed nations in Central America and the Pacific, including Belize and Nauru.
Taiwan has vowed to fight China's ""increasingly out of control"" behavior after Taipei last month lost another ally to Beijing when El Salvador became the third country to switch allegiances to China this year.
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has vowed not to bow to Chinese pressure, and Taipei has accused Beijing of offering generous aid and loan packages to lure its allies across, charges China strongly denies.
Cheng Tao, a former head of the Africa division at China's Foreign Ministry, said at the same news briefing that he had been involved in talks with African countries about abandoning Taiwan and recognizing China, and that money requests had come up.
""They said that while we want to establish diplomatic ties with China, we hope China can give us certain support financially,"" Cheng said, without naming the countries he had been in talks with. ""They were very blunt."" 
""We told them. Establishing ties is a political decision. It's not a deal,"" he added. 

China's hostility to Taiwan has grown since Tsai's election as Beijing fears she wishes to push for the island's formal independence, a red line for China. She says she wants to maintain the status quo but will defend Taiwan's democracy.

""Western accusations of Xinjiang governance seriously misled the extremists, making them believe they were launching religious Jihad and won sympathy and support from Western and international society,"" said the editorial in the Global Times, a tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily.
""Some forces have slandered China's governing efforts"" in Xinjiang, the editorial said, accusing a ""West-centered (value) system"" of making ""empty statements about human rights regardless of the purpose and effect of Xinjiang governance and the grim reality it targets.""
""Such empty talk inspires extremists, which meets the purposes of some Western politicians trying to undermine the governance achievements in Xinjiang and push the region into turmoil,"" the editorial said.
Whether Xinjiang governance abuses human rights must be judged by whether its results safeguard the interests of the majority in the region, it continued.
On Wednesday, a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers called for sanctions on Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses against minority Muslims in China's Xinjiang region, saying it was being turned into a ""high-tech police state.""
On Thursday, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a regular press briefing in Beijing that the United States did ""not have the right"" to make ""unwarranted criticism"" of China's policies toward ethnic minorities.
A United Nations human rights panel this month said it had received many credible reports that 1 million ethnic Uighurs in China were held in what resembled a ""massive internment camp that is shrouded in secrecy.""
China has said that Xinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists who plot attacks and stir up tensions between the mostly Muslim Uighur minority who call the region home and the ethnic Han Chinese majority.
Hundreds have died in unrest there in recent years.

311,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 11:54PM ET</span>",North Korea preparing toned-down military parade: analysts,"By Josh Smith
SEOUL (Reuters) - Satellite imagery shows North Korea is poised to stage another military parade amid new worries that diplomatic efforts on denuclearization are stalling, though analysts say it is unclear whether it will showcase any of the country's largest ballistic missiles.
Pyongyang is preparing to host a number of major events on Sept. 9 for the 70th anniversary of the country's founding, including a military parade, possible visits by foreign delegations, and - for the first time in five years - a massive choreographed performance known as the ""Mass Games.""
Parades have long been a way for North Korea to show off its military might, and September's show comes amid sensitive negotiations over the future of the country's nuclear and ballistic missile arsenal.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met U.S. President Donald Trump in June and agreed to ""work toward the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,"" but negotiations since then appear to have stalled with both sides increasingly criticizing the other for a lack of progress.
Based on commercial satellite imagery gathered by Planet Labs Inc., analysts say September's military parade is likely to be very similar to one staged on Feb. 8, but so far there is no sign of the controversial intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that are believed to be capable of targeting the United States.
""At the moment, this parade look pretty similar if not smaller than the one in February,"" said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at California’s Middlebury Institute of International Studies. 
Among the weapons the team at Middlebury spotted in Aug. 22 images of North Korea's Mirim Parade Training Ground are tanks, self-propelled artillery, infantry carriers, anti-aircraft missiles, and rocket launchers.
Other possible weapons arrayed on the parade ground include coastal defense cruise missiles, as well as at least six solid-fuel, short-range ballistic missiles possibly of a type first seen in February.
Analysts said that short-range ballistic missile is based on the Russian Iskander missile but also shares many features of South Korea’s Hyunmoo-2 missile.
""The first 99 vehicles are identical,"" Lewis said. ""After that we only see another 20 or so short-range missiles. There were more on parade in February, including ICBMs.""
Another analysis of the Planet Labs images, conducted by Joseph Bermudez at the Stimson Centre's 38 North website, also found no signs of ICBMs, but noted that an expanded number of heavy equipment storage shelters indicate September's parade ""will likely be considerably larger than the military parade earlier this year.""
If ICBMs or other large missiles are present, ""they would likely remain hidden under the shelters in the heavy equipment storage area until the day of the parade,"" Bermudez wrote.
Lewis acknowledged that there could be more weapons hidden in the sheds, but said at this point it is ""just speculation.""
Analysts say that so far there is no indication the parade will match the April 2017 ""Day of the Sun"" parade, in which Kim rolled out multiple new missile systems, helping to exacerbate rising tensions with the United States and South Korea.

""It probably wont be anything close to what we saw in 2017,"" said Dave Schmerler, a research associate at the Middlebury Institute.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's top electoral court on Friday barred jailed former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from running in this year's presidential because of his corruption conviction.
The widely expected decision removes a cloud hanging over Brazil's most uncertain election in decades - though Lula's lawyers have said they would appeal an adverse decision to the Supreme Court.
""What is at stake here today is the equality of all citizens before the law and the Constitution,"" Judge Og Fernandes told the court in his vote to declare Lula ineligible.
Judge Admar Gonzaga, who as a lawyer worked for Lula's handpicked successor Dilma Rousseff's 2010 election, cast the decisive vote in the 6-1 decision that sealed the leftist icon's ejection from the presidential election.
Lula, Brazil's most popular politician, is serving a 12-year sentence for a corruption conviction. His Workers Party registered him as its presidential candidate for the Oct. 7 vote anyway, saying he is innocent.
Lula is ineligible for office under Brazil's ""Clean Slate"" law, which prohibits candidates from running if they have convictions that have been upheld on appeal.
Despite his conviction and several graft cases pending against him, Lula leads the race by a long stretch, with 39 percent of voter support, according to pollster Datafolha. His nearest rival, far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro, has 19 percent.
Ads by the Workers Party calling on Brazilians to vote for Lula began to appear on social media on Friday, and will be shown on television as of Saturday when the race enters its final 35 days of campaigning.
Vice-presidential running mate Fernando Haddad, a former mayor of Sao Paulo, is expected to head the ticket hoping to inherit the bulk of Lula's votes. 
The party has until Sept. 17 to swap their names on the ballot, though the court gave it 10 days to make the change.
The court also ruled that Lula should not appear in the Workers Party's television and radio ads campaign until the ticket has been officially altered to remove him.

The court on Thursday had rejected another request by opponents of Lula to exclude his name from opinion polls.

TAOS, N.M. (Reuters) - Five residents of a New Mexico compound were arrested on Friday by the FBI for violating firearms and conspiracy laws in what one of their lawyers described as a ""bad development"" for the group, who are accused of planning anti-government attacks.
Jany Leveille, 35; Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, 40; Hujrah Wahhaj, 37; Subhanah Wahhaj, 35; and Lucas Morton, 40, were charged in criminal complaints filed in U.S. District Court in New Mexico, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said in a statement.
The arrests and charges came two days after two judges dismissed child abuse charges against the five defendants on procedural grounds and allowed three to be released from jail in Taos.
The FBI said it arrested the defendants ""without incident"" in Taos.
Marie Legrand Miller, defense attorney for Hujrah Wahhaj, called the arrests ""a very quick and peaceful turn-in.""
Tom Clark, Ibn Wahhaj's lawyer, said the arrests were not a huge surprise as the FBI had been ""involved from the beginning.""
The five defendants, who are all black and Muslim, came under FBI surveillance in May at their remote settlement north of Taos after Leveille sent a letter to Ibn Wahhaj's brother asking him to join them and become a ""martyr,"" state prosecutors said on Aug. 13. 
The five were first arrested following an Aug. 3 raid by the sheriff that found a cache of firearms and 11 children with no food or clean water, according to charges. Three days later police found the body of Ibn-Wahhaj's missing 3-year-old son in a tunnel at the compound. 
State prosecutors accused the five of training two of their teenage boys for attacks on ""corrupt institutions."" The five have yet to be charged over the allegations.
The federal complaint charges Leveille, a Haitian national, with being in the United States illegally and unlawfully in possession of firearms and ammunition. The other defendants are charged with aiding and conspiring with her.
The defendants face maximum sentences of between five and 10 years if convicted. Their first court hearing is on Tuesday in Albuquerque, the FBI said.

Lawyers for the other three defendants were not immediately available for comment.

The Syrian province of Idlib and surrounding areas are the last major enclave held by rebels opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, a close Russian ally. A source has told Reuters Assad is preparing a phased offensive to regain the province.
""The U.S sees this as an escalation of an already dangerous conflict,"" Pompeo said in a post on Twitter in which he also blasted Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov for ""defending (the) Syrian and Russian assault.""
Lavrov said on Friday the Syrian government had every right to chase militants out of Idlib and that talks continued on establishing humanitarian corridors there.
The State Department said the new U.S. special representative for Syria, James Jeffrey, would travel to Israel, Jordan, and Turkey a from Saturday to Tuesday on his first official trip abroad.
Jeffrey and his delegation will ""underscore that the United States will respond to any chemical weapons attack perpetrated by the Syrian regime,"" the State Department said in a statement.
They will also ""address Russia’s specious allegations of international plans to stage a chemical weapons attack in Syria,"" the statement said.
The United Nations on Thursday called on Russia, Iran and Turkey to forestall a battle in Idlib which would affect millions of civilians and could see both militants and the government potentially using chlorine as a chemical weapon.

Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, speaking after talks with Lavrov in Moscow on Thursday, said government forces will ""go all the way"" in the rebel-held northern region of Idlib, but that they did not have and would not use chemical weapons.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Washington's bitterly divided leaders came together on Friday to praise the late Senator John McCain as an embodiment of America's fighting spirit, idealism and sense of humor, but there was one notable absentee: President Donald Trump.
At a Capitol Rotunda ceremony, Republicans and Democrats called a temporary political truce to honor McCain on the third of five days of memorial celebrations in Arizona and Washington for the Vietnam War hero and two-time Republican presidential candidate.
""He would fight tooth and nail for his vision of the common good. Depending on the issue, you knew John would either be your staunchest ally or your most stubborn opponent,"" said Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who frequently clashed with McCain on issues such as healthcare and campaign finance reform.
""He had America’s fighting spirit, our noble idealism, our solemn patriotism, and our slightly irreverent streak -- all rolled into one,"" McConnell said.
The absence of Trump - who on Friday will travel to one of his private golf clubs for a campaign fundraiser - reflected the animosity between the two men that lingered even after McCain's death on Saturday from brain cancer.
Vice President Mike Pence told mourners Trump had asked him to attend to pay his respects.
""He will be missed. As President Trump said yesterday, we respect his service to the country,"" Pence said. 
Trump will also miss Saturday's service at the Washington National Cathedral, where former President Barack Obama, the Democrat who defeated McCain in 2008, and former Republican President George W. Bush, who beat McCain in their party's 2000 presidential nominating contest, will pay tribute to McCain.
House Speaker Paul Ryan said he was sometimes on the receiving end of McCain's ""distinct brand of candor"" and said the late senator relished a good fight.
""This is one of the bravest souls our nation has ever produced,"" Ryan said.
After the ceremony, McCain's family and those in attendance filed past the coffin, which sat atop a pine board catafalque originally built in 1865 for President Abraham Lincoln's casket.
Hundreds of mourners, who had lined up outside the Capitol to await their chance to pass through the Rotunda and pay their respects, began filing past in the afternoon.
""This is kind of like the death of an era. A man who stood up for what he believed, and I can't say I agreed with every position he took, but he did it with dignity,"" said retired schoolteacher Sue Ellen Raby, 71, who traveled more than 77 miles (124 km) from her Maryland home to pay her respects.
The Trump-McCain feud dated back to at least 2015, not long after Trump kicked off his presidential campaign. McCain condemned the candidate's hard-line rhetoric on illegal immigration, accusing Trump of ""firing up the crazies.""
The New York businessman hit back, saying of McCain's 5-1/2 years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam: ""He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured."" Trump received five deferments that got him out of military service.
More recently, McCain accused Trump of kowtowing to Russian President Vladimir Putin at July's Helsinki summit, calling it ""one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory.""
Trump in turn delayed issuing any statement after McCain's death. Earlier this week, the American flag atop the White House that had been at half-staff was raised back up, then lowered again after Trump drew fire from Congress and veterans.

McCain helped plan the events around his funeral. He made it clear to family and friends that he wanted Democratic former Vice President Joe Biden, Bush and Obama to speak - but that Trump was not welcome.

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales said on Friday his government has decided not to renew the mandate of a U.N.-backed anti-graft commission that helped bring down his predecessor and also tried to have Morales impeached.
Guatemala gave the commission a year to exit the country.
Working with Guatemala's attorney general, the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) in 2017 sought to prosecute Morales, a former comedian, over illegal financing allegations during his election campaign two years earlier.
That move followed separate CICIG graft probes into members of the president's family. Morales tried to throw the CICIG out of the country at the time, prompting criticism at home and from the United Nations and the U.S. State Department.
That bid failed, but Morales argued the CICIG needed to leave because its members were ""violating"" Guatemala's laws and ""sowing judicial terror"" with ""selective justice.""
""We have officially notified the Secretary General of the United Nations that we will not renew the mandate of the CICIG,"" Morales told a news conference in Guatemala City.
The CICIG's mandate in Guatemala will expire on Sept. 3, 2019, said a letter Morales sent to U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres. The CICIG had a year to transfer technical capacities to Guatemalan authorities and withdraw, it said.
Though Congress voted not to impeach the president in 2017, Morales' credibility was damaged due to the CICIG probe.
He has since sought to align himself more closely with the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.
In December, Guatemala was one of a handful of nations to back Trump's decision to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem in a vote at the United Nations.
Trump has also been critical of the United Nations.
Morales declared CICIG head Ivan Velasquez ""persona non grata"" in August 2017 and ordered him to leave Guatemala, but the nation's top court suspended the decision.
CICIG spokesman Matias Ponce told reporters the body appreciated the support of the international community and civil society and would keep the public informed about its next steps.

Morales won office in 2015 running on a platform of honest governance after his predecessor, Otto Perez Molina, was forced to resign and was imprisoned in a multimillion-dollar graft case led by the CICIG. Perez is still in prison while on trial.

(Reuters) - The number of cases of abuse in Chile's Roman Catholic Church under investigation by prosecutors has more than tripled to 119 in the past month, the national prosecuting authority said on Friday.
Among the 167 people under investigation are seven bishops and 96 priests, accused of unspecified abuses of 178 alleged victims, including 79 minors, the authority said.
A report from the authority sent to journalists on Friday did not specify the type of abuse but clergy have been accused by prosecutors of sexually abusing members of their congregations or covering-up abuse. 
The prosecuting authority did not respond to request for comment. 
In July civil prosecutors referred to 36 investigations involving an unspecified number of priests and bishops.
In May, Pope Francis summoned Chile's 34 bishops to Rome following a report by the Vatican's senior sex abuse investigator that accused them of ""grave negligence"" in investigating allegations that children had been abused and suggested evidence of sex crimes had been destroyed.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's Marxist ELN rebels must free all 19 hostages it holds before President Ivan Duque, who is evaluating peace talks with the group, will resume dialogue, a senior government official said on Friday.
The National Liberation Army (ELN) was in negotiations with the administration of former President Juan Manuel Santos since February 2017.
The last round of talks being held in Cuba between the Colombian government and ELN ended on Aug. 1. Duque, who took office on Aug. 7, said the group must end all violence and criminal activity for continuation of negotiations.
Miguel Ceballos, the government's high commissioner for peace, said in an interview that ""all those kidnapped - not just the nine kidnapped last month - must be released, and it must be immediate."" He said one captive has been held since 2002. He said the deadline to release them would end in a week. 
Right-wing Duque said in his inaugural speech that he would review the negotiations and make a decision within 30 days.
The ELN, founded by radical Catholic priests, is considered a terrorist group by the United States and European Union. It has waged a five-decade war against the government, engaging in bombings, kidnappings, extortion and sabotage of oil pipelines.
""Their will is not clear yet, but we can sit down and talk and ask them if they really ... are thinking about laying down their weapons and joining society,"" Ceballos said. 
The ELN said in a tweet on Friday, ""The ELN confirms its willingness to dialogue ... We continue in Cuba waiting for government delegation."" 
More than 260,000 people have died in Colombia's conflict including government troops and members of the ELN, the FARC and right-wing paramilitaries.
Santos was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to reach a peace agreement with the larger rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which is now a political party with seats in congress.
Duque has criticized that agreement, saying it was too lenient on the rebels. 

During a ceasefire from September 2017 to January 2018, the ELN suspended hostage-taking, attacks on oil installations, the use of landmines and the recruitment of minors.

320,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>",Federal judge rules against Texas request to end 'Dreamers' program,"(Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday denied a request by Texas and other states governed by Republicans to immediately end a program launched by Democratic former president Barack Obama that protects immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children.
U.S. Judge Andrew Hanen of the Southern District of Texas said the states had shown they were harmed by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, or DACA, but, he said, they could not prevail legally because of ""their delay in pursuing the claims they now bring concerning DACA,"" which was first established in 2012.
The program protects around 700,000 young adults from deportation and gives them work permits for two-year periods, after which they must re-apply.
Texas and other states that brought the lawsuit earlier this year had argued that DACA allows illegal aliens to remain in the country, which drives up the costs of healthcare and policing and makes it harder for lawful residents to find work. 
The states also argued that the DACA program flouts the will of Congress because it was created without congressional action.
Civil rights organizations, businesses and universities had intervened in the Texas case to protect DACA.
They argued that the states had failed to provide convincing evidence that DACA hurts their coffers and that by authorizing DACA recipients to work their states would get more tax revenue.
Hanen, who was appointed by Republican U.S. President George W. Bush, issued a second order on Friday giving Texas permission to appeal his ruling.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement after the ruling that the plaintiffs were ""now very confident that DACA will soon meet the same fate"" as a parallel Obama program, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans, which was previously struck down by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Paxton led a coalition of dozens of states in taking legal action against that program.
""Our lawsuit is vital to restoring the rule of law to our nation's immigration system,"" Paxton said. 
Republican President Donald Trump said last year that he would terminate DACA and end its protection for the immigrants who are sometimes called ""Dreamers.""
He gave the Republican-controlled Congress six months to replace it, but policy differences between Trump and lawmakers in both parties led to Congress' failing to act. 

Courts have ruled that the program can stay in place for now, although new applications will not be accepted.

MOSCOW/KIEV (Reuters) - The leader of Russian-backed separatists in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine was killed in an explosion at a cafe on Friday, prompting Russia to accuse Ukraine of assassinating him while Kiev blamed separatist infighting.
Russia's foreign ministry accused Ukraine of killing the separatist leader, Alexander Zakharchenko, to try to unleash a renewed war in eastern Ukraine, but Kiev said it had nothing to do with the blast.
An aide to Zakharchenko said the rebels had seen an increased movement of Ukrainian armored vehicles heading toward the separatist region, RIA news agency reported, a claim rejected by Ukraine's military. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin called the killing a ""dastardly"" crime aimed at destabilizing a fragile regional peace, but he did not accuse Kiev of being behind it.
Zakharchenko, who led the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic since 2014, ""received injuries incompatible with life as a result of an explosion in the center of Donetsk,"" the separatist administration said in a statement.
Russian-backed rebels threw off Ukrainian central rule in an armed uprising after pro-Western leaders opposed by Moscow came to power in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, in 2014.
A shaky internationally-brokered ceasefire has been in force since 2015, halting large-scale fighting, though there are still frequent outbreaks of shooting on the front line between the separatist and Ukrainian forces.
In a telegram of condolences released by the Kremlin, Putin praised Zakharchenko as a true popular leader and a patriot. 
""The dastardly killing of Alexander Zakharchenko is further evidence: those who have chosen the path of terror, violence and spreading fear do not want to seek a peaceful political solution to the conflict,"" he said. He did not say who these people were.
Russia's Foreign Ministry had every reason to believe Kiev was responsible for Zakharchenko's death, ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on the Rossiya-24 state television station. 
Russia's Investigative Committee, the state body that handles major crimes, said it was treating the killing as an act of international terrorism.
In Kiev, a spokeswoman for the state Security Service, Yelena Gitlyanskaya, dismissed Moscow's accusations, saying the killing was a result of years-long ""internal fighting... between the terrorists and their Russian sponsors"".
Denying a rebel claim of increased military activity by Kiev's forces, an officer in Ukraine's Joint Forces Operation said: ""Everything is operating in a routine fashion. This (claim) is either fake or they are preparing for something.""
Ukraine's General Staff declined to comment on the matter.
INFIGHTING
Zakharchenko, a 42-year-old former coalmine electrician, became leader of the Donetsk Republic in November 2014. Other rebel leaders say he was handpicked for the role by Moscow. A vote held by separatists confirmed him in office.
The separatists have been dogged by infighting that has, on occasion, turned violent. Several past leaders of the separatists have fled the region, saying they feared for their lives after their comrades turned on them.
Earlier this year, three sources who led the original uprising in 2014 told Reuters they expected Zakharchenko to be pushed aside, with Moscow's assistance, and that a new rebel leadership would take over.
At least five other leading separatist commanders have been killed in unexplained circumstances not connected to front-line combat. 
Separatist officials blamed Ukraine for those deaths, while Kiev -- and some separatists speaking on condition of anonymity -- said in some cases the commanders were killed in internal purges.
Among those killed was Arseny Pavlov, who went by the nom de guerre ""Motorola"" and was blown up in the lift of his apartment building in Donetsk in October 2016. 
Another prominent casualty was Alexander Bednov, nicknamed ""Batman,"" a senior commander in the Luhansk People's Republic, another eastern Ukrainian breakaway region that neighbors Donetsk. He was killed in January 2015 when his convoy came under fire in a location where, at the time, there was no fighting with Ukrainian forces.

The region's official media outlet said on Friday that Dmitry Trapeznikov, 37, deputy head of the region's council of ministers, had been appointed temporary leader.

ZURICH (Reuters) - A Swiss asset manager who in 2013 provided U.S. prosecutors with more than 100 files from clients suspected of dodging taxes has been cleared of spying-related charges in his home country, recently published Swiss court documents showed.
Martin Egli, who had hired one of the country's best-known defense attorneys to help clear his name, was awarded 33,300 Swiss francs ($34,031) in the case, mostly for legal fees. 
Contacted by Reuters on Friday, Egli confirmed the verdict and said he bore no grudge. The case is closed, he said, declining to provide any further comment.
In a 17-page ruling, a Swiss judge concluded there was insufficient evidence to convict him. It was delivered in May, but published only later by the Swiss Federal Criminal Court. Details have not been widely reported, even in Switzerland.
""It can be presumed in favor of the accused that he believed in the legality of his approach and didn't consider the possibility that he acted unlawfully for a foreign state,"" the ruling said.
In November 2013, Egli's Swisspartners Group provided records on 109 clients to the U.S. Department of Justice, court documents show, helping his company secure a relatively mild $4.4 million settlement deal with American prosecutors aggressively pursuing tax cheats with wealth stashed abroad. [https://reut.rs/2NzxLWs]
The move landed him in trouble in Switzerland, however, where authorities accused Egli of ""forbidden actions in the service of a foreign country."" The Swiss attorney general's office (OAG) sought fines of $275,000. 
While U.S. DOJ officials lauded his ""extraordinary cooperation"" at the time, Egli was criticized at home by some Swiss media for turning over client data as he secured a non-prosecution agreement for Swisspartners.
Egli remains the chairman of Swisspartners. His lawyer was Lorenz Erni, who represented ex-FIFA chief Sepp Blatter when he fought ethics charges in 2015 before being banned from football.
Egli's case is an easy-to-miss footnote among the billions of dollars of U.S. settlements in recent years reached by dozens of Swiss banks over harboring untaxed assets. 
Banking secrecy once made Switzerland a haven for offshore money, though recent changes have made it difficult to hide assets here from tax authorities.
In 2014,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) paid $2.6 billion after pleading guilty to conspiring to help U.S. citizens dodge taxes. This month, Zuercher Kantonalbank agreed to pay nearly $100 million, while Basler Kantonalbank paid over $60 million to U.S. authorities.

MANAGUA (Reuters) - Nicaragua's government has ordered the expulsion of a United Nations human rights delegation, shortly after the body released a scathing report condemning repression and abuses committed by President Daniel Ortega's administration.
In a letter dated Aug. 30 addressed to Marlene Alejos, the regional representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR), Foreign Minister Denis Moncada ended an invitation to the U.N. delegation, effective that day.
""Given that the reasons, causes and conditions that gave rise to this invitation have ceased,"" wrote Moncada, ""this Ministry announces that it concludes the invitation and finalizes the visit as of August 30.""
The letter was released by the UNHCHR and posted on the regional U.Sl website.
Over 300 people have been killed and at least 2,000 injured in crack-downs by police and armed groups on protests that began in April over government plans to cut welfare benefits. That soon escalated into broader opposition against Ortega.
The U.N. delegation had been invited, the letter asserted, to accompany the Truth and Security Commission created ""to secure and dismantle the barricades,"" which protesters had thrown up at street corners and highways, Moncada wrote.
The regional office of the UNHCHR said in a statement on Friday it would ""continue its work of monitoring and reporting on the human rights situation in Nicaragua remotely.""
On Wednesday, the U.N. delegation released a report documenting human rights violations between April 18 and Aug. 18, including the disproportionate use of force and extrajudicial killings by the Nicaraguan police, disappearances, widespread arbitrary detentions and instances of torture and sexual violence in detention centers.
It asserted that Nicaragua's government had turned a blind eye while armed mobs rounded up protesters, some of whom were later raped with rifles and tortured in detention.
In a 33-page rebuttal on Wednesday, Nicaragua said the U.N. Human Rights Office report issued in Geneva had ignored that the real aim of the protests was violence aimed at overthrowing a democratically elected government.
The Nicaraguan government did not immediately reply on Friday to request for comment.
But speaking to a rally of supporters on Thursday, Ortega alluded to the U.N. report, saying, ""nobody wants international organizations because they become instruments of the powerful, those who impose their polemics of death on the peoples of planet Earth.""
Human rights advocates in Nicaragua condemned the removal of the U.N. delegation.

""This signifies an expulsion because they haven't finished their work in the country,"" said Marlin Sierra, executive director of the Nicaraguan Center of Human Rights (CENIDH).

326,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 03:12PM ET</span>","U.S. associate of indicted Russian pleads guilty, to cooperate with Mueller","By Nathan Layne and David Alexander
(Reuters) - A business partner of Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian indicted by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, pleaded guilty on Friday to failing to register as a lobbyist for a pro-Kremlin political party in Ukraine and agreed to cooperate with Mueller's probe.
Samuel Patten, 47, also admitted to soliciting a U.S. citizen to act as a straw purchaser to buy tickets to the inauguration of President Donald Trump for a Ukrainian oligarch, circumventing a law restricting such purchases by foreigners.
The plea agreement, which includes cooperating with Mueller's office, raises the prospect Patten will be called to testify against Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chief who faces a second trial in Washington next month, or Kilimnik, who was indicted for witness tampering in the same case. 
The charge Patten pleaded guilty to - violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) by not disclosing lobbying work for Ukrainian politicians - is similar to one of the core allegations against Manafort in his upcoming trial.
In his first trial, Manafort was found guilty of bank and tax fraud by a federal jury in Virginia last week.
Michael Zeldin, a former federal prosecutor, predicted Patten will be a witness in the D.C. trial. ""He will know how those guys conducted their business relations and can probably shed light on efforts made to evade FARA reporting requirements,"" he said.
Patten admitted to working with a Russian national to lobby members of Congress and the executive branch on behalf of the pro-Russian Opposition Bloc between 2014 and 2018 without disclosing the work to the U.S. government as required by law.
While the Russian national is not named in court papers made public on Friday, the description matches Kilimnik.
The charge, which carries a maximum of five years in prison, was brought by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia and the Justice Department's National Security Division, which started investigating Patten after a referral from Mueller. 
Patten's work in Ukraine dovetails somewhat with that of Manafort. He made most of his money working for former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, whose party regrouped into the Opposition Bloc after Yanukovych fled to Russia in 2014.
But Patten's ties to Kilimnik are more concrete. The two set up political advisory firm Begemot Ventures Ltd LLC in February 2015, according to its Washington corporate registration, which is still active.
In court documents, federal prosecutors said Patten's company received more than $1 million for his work for Opposition Bloc members and for other Ukrainian consulting, starting in 2015, with payments made through Cypriot bank accounts. 
One of Patten's main benefactors was an unnamed Ukrainian oligarch, according to the documents. 
Patten helped Kiev Mayor Vitali Klitschko get re-elected in 2015 in ""one of the toughest anti-government atmospheres in that country’s history,"" according to an archived page from Patten's website detailing his accomplishments in Ukraine.
Patten appeared before U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who will oversee Manafort's upcoming trial. 
Patten was released on his own recognizance but cannot travel outside the Washington area without notifying the court. Jackson said sentencing would come at a later date.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and his namesake foundation asked a judge to dismiss a lawsuit by New York's attorney general over the nonprofit's activities, including in the 2016 presidential campaign, calling it a politically motivated attack.
In Thursday night court filings, a lawyer for Trump said Attorney General Barbara Underwood's lawsuit was part of her office's mission to ""lead the resistance"" against the Republican president, attack him where possible and sue rather than settle.
Underwood, a Democrat, in June said a 21-month probe begun under her predecessor Eric Schneiderman uncovered ""extensive unlawful political coordination"" by the Donald J. Trump Foundation with Trump's White House campaign, and ""repeated and willful self-dealing"" to benefit the president.
But the defendants' lawyer Alan Futerfas said ""nearly every penny"" the foundation raised supported ""those most in need,"" and that the defendants, including Trump's three adult children, did nothing wrong that justified the lawsuit.
He also questioned why Underwood's office had ignored ""serious and significant allegations of misconduct"" involving the foundation of former U.S. President Bill Clinton, whose wife Hillary was defeated by Trump in the 2016 White House race.
""The appearance of bias and impropriety on the part of this governmental agency, charged with impartial decision-making, is simply overwhelming,"" Futerfas wrote.
Underwood's spokeswoman Amy Spitalnick said on Twitter that the attorney general ""won't back down from holding President Trump and his associates accountable for their flagrant violations of New York law.
""As our lawsuit detailed, the Trump Foundation functioned as a personal piggy bank to serve Trump's business and political interests,"" she added.
The lawsuit filed in a New York state court in Manhattan seeks to dissolve the Trump foundation, recoup $2.8 million, and ban Trump and his children Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka from leadership roles in New York charities.
Trump had on Twitter called the lawsuit a concoction by ""sleazy New York Democrats,"" and pledged not to settle.
He has also criticized the Clinton Foundation, which is known for helping lower HIV drug costs in developing countries. It has called Trump's attacks also politically motivated.
The president faces a multitude of investigations, and many lawsuits by Democratic-led or -leaning states.
Underwood's lawsuit challenged Trump Foundation transactions including $100,000 paid to a charity to settle a dispute involving Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, and $10,000 spent on a portrait of Trump that was later hung at one of his golf clubs.

Schneiderman resigned in May after being accused of physically abusing women, which he denied.

Scholz told a business conference in France on Wednesday that governments should support mergers and stop concentrating projects solely on local companies to make better use of procurement spending and stay competitive.
Volker Thum, a former Airbus executive who now heads the BDLI German Aerospace Industries Association, agreed that changes were needed to allow European firms to keep up in an increasingly competitive global market.
""Given ever more complex and cost-intensive development programs, this will only be possible through increased cooperation and a consolidation of the European defense industry,"" Thum said in a statement to Reuters. 
""Giving up some sovereignty would mean big gains in capability. We cannot afford to continue to have 28 isolated solutions,"" he said, referring to the number of EU member states.
Hans-Christoph Atzpodien, managing director of the BDSV German Security and Defence Industry group, said the conditions were ripe for a more intensive European defense cooperation.
""The joint political and military will to cooperate is an important prerequisite for successful industrial cooperation. At the same time, it requires industrially doable structures that are not overshadowed by political wishes.""
Atzpodien said the defense industry could only become more European if military requirements, competitive conditions and export regulations were harmonized across the 28 member states.
Despite long-standing calls for mergers, European governments and defense contractors have made little progress toward consolidating the industry.
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who was at the conference with Scholz, said this month that plans to combine the civilian shipyards of French state-owned shipbuilder Naval Group and Italian group Fincantieri should not include defense assets.

The multinational Airbus A400M military transport plane has also set an uninspiring example for cross-border defense cooperation as the program has been plagued by cost overruns and delays.

329,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 01:13PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Brazilian leftist meets investors to tame fears of PT return to power,"By Lisandra Paraguassu
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Fernando Haddad, the Workers Party vice-presidential candidate who could be catapulted to Brazil's presidency if Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is barred from running, has quietly met with major investors to tame fears of a leftist return to power.
Haddad, an economist, told Reuters he has met with several investment firms and banks in recent weeks, an echo of Lula's move toward the center in 2002 when he won his first term after pledging to follow orthodox economic policies. 
Haddad did not provide details about the meetings. 
However, several market sources and PT members who took part said he met with senior executives of JP Morgan,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Itau, UBS, BTG Pactual, XP Investimentos and Guide Investimentos in the past few weeks. 
He plans to meet with top executives of  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and senior officials at Brazil's national banking federation Febraban in the coming days, according to PT members who accompanied him to the meetings.
The press offices of those firms did not immediately reply to requests for comment. 
Other candidates on competing presidential tickets have met with financial firms, but Haddad's making the pilgrimage to Sao Paulo's business center recently was unexpected, as Lula insists he is the victim of a right-wing conspiracy of elites to block his returning to power and shifting the country back on a leftward course. 
Haddad said he and Lula agree that Brazil faces ""serious tax, credit and fiscal problems"" but both thought the reforms to labor laws and government spending made under President Michel Temer were ""counterproductive"" because they had not sparked growth.
A former mayor of Sao Paulo, Haddad said he supports inflation targeting, floating exchange rates and budget surpluses. However, he provided no details on the means or targets the PT would employ if returned to power.
Lula's continued dominance in election polls has rattled markets, with Brazil's currency now trading near record lows.
Since he was found guilty of graft, Lula's rhetoric has skewed far to the left of the pragmatic centrist political image he cultivated while in power. The former union leader held office from 2003-2010. 
""Haddad showed that he is far more open to dialogue than we were expecting,"" said an investment firm economist who met with him recently. ""He sold a moderate image that could calm the market, but there remain the same old fears of the PT.""
The main worry is that Haddad lacks a strong PT base, despite being chosen by Lula to fill his spot on the ticket if he is barred. The party shifted left after Lula's handpicked successor, Dilma Rousseff, was impeached, raising concerns Haddad cannot tame its militant factions. 
HADDAD VS. BOLSONARO
October's election is the most unpredictable since Brazil's return to democracy three decades ago. The country's top electoral court is expected to bar Lula from running within days, as his corruption conviction upheld on appeal disqualifies him under a ""clean slate"" law.
Lula, 72, says he is innocent and was singled out in corruption investigations so he could not regain the presidency and reverse Temer's reforms, which included loosening labor laws and creating a 20-year government spending cap.
The same polls that show Lula way ahead also indicate that if barred, he could likely transfer enough of his support to Haddad to push him into a second-round runoff.
Haddad, 55, would likely face far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro, 63, who is ahead in the polls when Lula's name is excluded and who named a well-known investment banker to head his economic team.
Five analysts and economists from different firms who met with Haddad told Reuters they were soothed by his pragmatic talk, but that the market remains divided between Bolsonaro and Haddad when it comes to who can jumpstart the globe's eighth-largest economy. 
The Bolsonaro economic team's talk of mass privatizations pleases market players, but the candidate's lengthy statist voting record during nearly three decades in congress and unpredictability are increasingly generating anxiety and doubt. 
That benefits Haddad, and market sources who met with him where impressed by his talk of a pragmatic economic approach and willingness to entertain different ideas. 
""Our evaluation was that Haddad is much more reasonable than the PT as whole,"" said one analyst. 
Another plus for Haddad, market sources said, was that even amid the political upheaval of recent years, the PT would be more prepared to engage in the political horse trading required to govern, as opposed to Bolsonaro, a member of Social Liberal Party, a fringe party with virtually no coalition.
Samuel Pessoa, an economist and researcher with the Getulio Vargas Foundation in Sao Paulo who is a member of the PT's traditional rival PSDB, has known Haddad since the pair studied economics together. He said Haddad is not an ""adventurer"" when it comes to policy and that he would not morph into a member of the PT's more militant and leftwing factions. 
But Pessoa said he shared the same concerns analysts expressed. 

""The PT right now is very bitter, spiteful and authoritarian,"" Pessoa said. ""Haddad is going to have to work with the more reasonable people within the party.""

BASRA, Iraq (Reuters) - Hundreds of Iraqi protesters stoned and tried to break into the provincial government headquarters in the southern oil hub of Basra on Friday to press demands for better public services and an end to pervasive corruption.
Some protesters also set fire to tires outside the building and there were minor clashes with riot police who fired tear gas to try to quell the protest. No serious injuries were reported.
By 7 p.m. (1600 GMT) protesters had destroyed part of the concrete wall surrounding the headquarters and were hurling petrol bombs through the gap towards the building, while chanting anti-government slogans.
Protests have swept cities in the long neglected south, Iraq's Shi'ite Muslim heartland, over widespread electricity outages during the blistering hot Iraqi summer, a lack of jobs and proper government services, and entrenched graft.
Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi suspended the electricity minister last month and said earlier this week that his government had begun punishing those responsible for poor services in Basra, Iraq's second biggest city.
Public anger is rising at a time when politicians are struggling to form a new government after an inconclusive parliamentary election in May. Iraq's top Shi'ite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani has expressed support for the protests.
Friday's protests were particularly concerned with the high level of salt in Basra's drinking water that residents say makes it undrinkable. 

The city's infrastructure is crumbling from years of neglect and under-investment, generating widespread bitterness as locals contrast their impoverishment with the oil wealth the province provides for federal government coffers.

333,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 12:40PM ET</span>",Briton jailed for life over plot to kill PM May,"LONDON (Reuters) - A British man was sentenced to life in prison on Friday over a plot to kill Prime Minister Theresa May by first detonating an explosive device to get into her Downing Street office and then using a knife or a gun to attack her.
Naa'imur Rahman, 21, of north London, planned to detonate an improvised explosive device at the heavily guarded gates of Downing Street and gain access to May’s office in the ensuing chaos and assassinate her, according to police.
He was convicted last month of preparing to commit acts of terrorism and at London's Old Bailey court on Friday was given a life prison and will serve 30 years behind bars.
""Rahman’s target was the prime minister but he had no qualms about killing innocent bystanders in the process of reaching her,"" said Dean Haydon, the UK's Senior National Coordinator for Counter Terrorism.
""At one point he told a covert counter terrorism officer that even if he could not reach the Prime Minister, he just wanted to strike fear into people.""
As he put the plot together, Rahman believed he was corresponding online with members of the Islamic State (IS) militant group. However, he was actually talking to undercover officers from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Britain's MI5 domestic spy agency.
He was arrested last November shortly after unwittingly meeting an undercover police officer and collecting what he believed was a homemade bomb but was in fact a harmless replica.
After his conviction in July, police said Rahman had been in contact with an uncle who had traveled to Syria and joined IS and who had encouraged his nephew to carry out attacks in Britain.
Rahman had been planning to carry out the attack for two years but his resolve was hardened when he heard that his uncle had been killed in a drone attack.
Britain is on its second highest threat level with an attack considered highly likely. Last year, there were four deadly attacks and the head of MI5 said in May that a further 12 Islamist plots had been foiled since the first of these in March 2017. 
Earlier this month, a man was charged with attempted murder after a car careered into people and a barrier at London's parliament, with police saying the incident was being treated as an act of terrorism.

Family Minister Franziska Giffey laid flowers at the scene of the crime in the eastern German city of Chemnitz on Friday, the first member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's cabinet to visit after an incident that has laid bare deep divisions over a 2015 decision to welcome over a million mostly Muslim migrants.
She said the unrest that followed the stabbing was a wake-up call for the federal government to pay attention to public concerns, and suggested an additional cabinet minister or Merkel herself could visit the city at a later point.
Michael Kretschmer, premier of the state of Saxony, where Chemnitz lies, said the failure to deport the suspect, a 22-year-old Iraqi man with multiple previous convictions, was the responsibility of federal authorities.
A local court in Chemnitz on Friday confirmed that Yousif Ibrahim Abdullah could have been deported two years ago to Bulgaria, where he first applied for asylum, but authorities missed a six-month deadline for doing so.
Anti-migrant groups and far-right extremists have seized on the case as proof that Merkel's open door policy let in criminals and terrorists, with fake news reports and a leaked arrest warrant further inflaming the mood.
The chief federal prosecutor's office said it had begun a preliminary investigation into whether the rapid mobilization of far-right protesters revealed an organized network.
Many Germans have recoiled at the anti-migrant violence seen after the stabbing death. A new poll for broadcaster ZDF showed 76 percent of Germans see far-right extremists as posing a danger to German democracy.
Alexander Gauland, leader of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, rejected that view, and said it was ""legitimate"" for Germans to feel angry after such a crime.
He criticized politicians and the media for branding all the protesters as far-right extremists and said his party did not condone the dozen ""Hitler salutes"" reported at Monday's rally.
Gauland said AfD chapters in Saxony and two other states would convene a march on Saturday to mourn the 35-year old carpenter killed, and criticized state police for losing control of Monday's protests, which drew some 6,000 supporters.
Kretschmer told German broadcaster ARD on Friday that the AfD - which won nearly 13 percent of the vote in last year's federal election - bore some blame for the riots after it ""used very warlike language to call people to take to the streets"".

GENEVA (Reuters) - More than a million Syrian children are at risk in the event of a government military assault on the rebel-held province of Idlib, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said on Friday.
Manuel Fontaine, UNICEF director of emergency programs, said that the agency has drawn up contingency plans including providing clean water and nutritional supplies to some of the estimated 450,000 to 700,000 people who could flee an attack.
An estimated 2.9 million people live in the northern region of Idlib, half of them already displaced from other areas in Syria as opposition supporters fled there from other areas captured by government forces.
""It's more than one million kids... When you hear the kind of military rhetoric about an offensive and all that, I think it's important to remember that it's not just against a group of armed men,"" Fontaine told Reuters in Geneva.
""It's actually a very large proportion of women and children who have no stake in it, and elderly men and others,"" he said, speaking after holding talks in Damascus this week with deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad. 
Idlib and surrounding areas are the last major enclave held by rebels opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. A source has told Reuters that Assad is preparing a phased offensive to regain the province.
Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said on Friday the Syrian government had every right to chase ""terrorists"" out of Idlib and that talks on establishing humanitarian corridors there were ongoing. Russia is Syria's main ally, along with Iran.
U.N. Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura has called on Russia, Iran and Turkey to try to delay the battle and called for humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians.
Many families in Idlib have been uprooted multiple times, evacuated as front lines shift, Fontaine said. 
""There's some children who have been displaced seven times already, going from one place to the other. It means that their coping mechanisms, their resilience is very drained at the moment so they are particularly vulnerable. That's a major concern obviously.""
If there is an assault, civilians would be expected to flee toward Aleppo or Hama and Homs, rather than to Turkey, he said.
""We are anticipating, there are scenarios of possible displacement of between 450,000 and 700,000 people on the move,"" Fontaine said. They include 400,000 possibly in the first week.

""We are not part of a discussion on humanitarian corridors at this stage. But I think what is important for us is that people who want to be able to move can move as long as they want to do it and they do it in safety and security,"" Fontaine said.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Turkey cannot revive its strained relationship with the European Union until it frees German citizens it has detained, Germany's foreign minister said on Friday as his Turkish counterpart called for a fresh start with the bloc.
Turkey, which has had awkward relations with Europe for several years, is seeking to mend them at a time when its currency has been falling and its ties with the United States have sharply deteriorated.
Germany says 50 of its citizens are being held in Turkish prisons following a crackdown after a failed coup in July 2016. Only seven have been charged. Another 35 are blocked from leaving the country.
""These cases must be resolved,"" Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, who will make his first official trip to Ankara next week, told reporters during a meeting between EU foreign ministers and countries aspiring to join the European Union, including Turkey. 
""That would be a step towards normalizing relations with Germany, but also with the European Union,"" he said, adding that he would press the issue during his two-day trip to Ankara and Istanbul from Wednesday.
Ties between Germany and Turkey, both members of the U.S.-led NATO alliance, have been extremely tense since Berlin condemned Ankara's arrests of some 50,000 people and the suspension or firing of 150,000 in the post-coup crackdown.
There has however been a slight thaw in recent months after Turkey released one German-Turkish journalist and allowed another German citizen to leave the country.
Talks with Turkey on EU membership were effectively suspended last year, although Ankara remains a candidate.
Ankara says the scale of its crackdown is justified by the gravity of events on July 15, 2016, when rogue soldiers commandeered tanks, planes and helicopters, bombing parliament and government buildings in their attempt to seize power.
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said in Vienna that the EU failed to understand Turkey's security challenge.
""We don't have any problem with the EU or with Europe, we are part of this continent,"" Cavusoglu told reporters. ""Yes we have some issues with the European Union, particularly after the attempted coup. The measures we had to take were not understood by Europe ... but now we want to normalize our relations.""
As well as reviving stalled EU membership talks, Ankara wants more EU money to house Syrian refugees, a deeper customs union with the bloc and progress in talks on letting Turks visit the EU without visas.
The EU is wary of what it sees as rapid backsliding on democracy and human rights in Turkey, and was angered by rhetoric from President Tayyip Erdogan last year, including comparing the Dutch and German governments to Nazis.

Asked in Vienna if Turkey needed economic aid from the European Union to stop the fall in the value of the Turkish lira, Maas said: ""The first thing for Turkey is to complete the conditions for normalization ... the ball is in Turkey's court.""

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - India will help Nepal construct a rail link between capital Kathmandu and an Indian border town for smoother movement of passengers and cargo to the landlocked Himalayan nation, which neighboring China is also trying to woo with a similar plan.
An agreement to study the feasibility of a rail line linking the two countries was signed by Nepal's Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli and Indian premier Narendra Modi on Friday during a meeting on the sidelines of a regional summit of seven South and East Asian countries.
India's Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd will conduct a preliminary engineering and traffic survey for the rail line, India's embassy in Nepal said in a statement.
The planned 130 km (80.78 mile) line from the Indian border town of Raxaul in eastern Bihar state to Nepalese capital Kathmandu, once built, will just be the second rail track in the mountainous nation. Nepal's only railway link is a 35 km stretch in its southern plains.
Construction of the rail line and its funding will be finalised after the Konkan Railway submits its findings, officials said.
The bulk of Nepal's overland foreign trade is routed through Raxaul and accounts for nearly two thirds of all trade in the landlocked nation. Imports by roadways are often delayed and expensive as cargo is carried in diesel-guzzling trucks.
""The Raxaul-Kathmandu rail line is expected to expand connectivity by enhancing people-to-people linkages between the two countries and promoting economic growth and development,"" the Indian embassy statement said.
Nepal, wedged between China and India, is seeking to lessen its heavy dependence on New Delhi for trade and the supply of essential goods such as fuel, as it tries to improve connectivity with China.
China has already conducted a pre-feasibility study for a 70 km (42 miles) link connecting Gyiron in Tibet with Kathmandu, making it one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects in the rugged Himalayan mountains.
Political analysts say India's plan to build the rail link in Nepal comes as New Delhi jostles with Beijing to wield greater influence over smaller neighbors.

The notice in the Official Gazette matches a decision by the United Nations in June to add Tahrir al-Sham to the list of people and organizations whose assets are to be frozen because of links to militant groups al Qaeda and Islamic State.
It comes before an expected attack by the Syrian army, backed by Russia, on the northwestern Syrian region of Idlib which is home to nearly 3 million people on the border with Turkey.
Tahrir al-Sham, which includes the al Qaeda-linked group formerly known as Nusra Front, is the most powerful jihadist alliance in Idlib, the last major rebel-controlled enclave outside Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's control.
Russia said on Friday the Syrian government had every right to chase terrorists out of Idlib, adding that talks were underway to set up humanitarian corridors there.
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said last week it would be disastrous to seek a military solution in Idlib, even though there were militants there. 
Ankara, which has a small military presence in Idlib, has warned an assault could unleash a fresh wave of refugees.
""It is important for all of us to neutralize these radical groups,"" he said. ""But we have to distinguish the civilians from the terrorist groups.""
U.N. Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said on Thursday there was a high concentration of foreign fighters in Idlib, including an estimated 10,000 who he said belonged to Nusra Front and al Qaeda.
But he said there should be no rush to military action and called for more time for Russia, Turkey and Iran to discuss the situation in Idlib. 
The decision to add Tahrir al-Sham to the list of designated groups was taken by President Tayyip Erdogan. Ankara had already listed Nusra Front as a terrorist group.
Erdogan is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at a three-way summit in Iran on Sept. 7.

Lesbos, not far from Turkey in the northeastern Aegean Sea, was the preferred entry point into the European Union in 2015 for nearly a million Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis.
Those three groups still comprise more than 70 percent of those arriving in Greece, and typically have high recognition rates for their asylum claims, but the overall flow is far less than in previous years, UNHCR said.
Although 1,350 refugees and asylum seekers were transferred to mainland sites in August, this failed to ease pressure as an average of 114 people arrived daily during the month, it said.
""The situation is reaching boiling point at the Moria reception identification center on Lesbos, where more than 7,000 asylum seekers and migrants are crammed into shelters built to accommodate just 2,000 people,"" Charlie Yaxley, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told a Geneva briefing.
Some have been there for over six months and one quarter are children, he said. A reception center on Samos island holds 2,700, nearly four times the number it was designed for, while centers on Chios and Kos are at close to double their capacity.
""We are particularly concerned about woefully inadequate sanitary facilities, fighting amongst frustrated communities, rising levels of sexual harassment and assaults and the increasing need for medical and psycho-social care,"" he said.
Yaxley could not confirm aid agency reports of possible suicide attempts among youth at the centers, but said: 
""There are an increasing number of children who are presenting with mental health issues. The available response and treatment is woefully inadequate at the moment.""
The Greek government has made previous commitments to transfer people to shelters on the mainland, and has received European Union funding for it, Yaxley said.
But other EU countries must help ""frontline states"" including Greece, Italy and Spain who receive most of the refugees and migrants, he said, adding:

""The people arriving in Europe today is a very manageable situation; it's a question of political will.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU and UK negotiators on Friday talked up prospects of agreeing a Brexit deal this autumn, citing recent progress in detailing very close security cooperation to take effect after Britain leaves the bloc. 
The European Union's Michel Barnier said it was ""possible"" to get an agreement in time for a summit of all the bloc's leaders in Brussels on Oct. 18-19, though a delay into November was also possible.

Barnier said unresolved issues included geographical indication labels for specialized local products, nuclear cooperation, data protection and the role of the EU's top court in policing the agreement.
After weeks of warning of growing risk of a damaging no-deal Brexit and signaling delay was expected if there is to be any Brexit deal, the EU's strategy is now to highlight how close cooperation with Britain is possible after Brexit to make London more willing to accept divorce terms.
That goes specifically for the sensitive issue of the EU-UK land border between Ireland and British-ruled Northern Ireland, where the EU wants a ""backstop"" solution in case of no deal, which includes terms that are anathema to London.
""We must have a detailed backstop solution, which is legally operational in the withdrawal agreement,"" Barnier said. ""This backstop is critical, it's essential to concluding these negotiations. With no backstop, there will be no agreement.""
Barnier said the EU and UK were working for an ""unprecedented partnership"" in the future that would include a broad free-trade agreement, as well as sectoral cooperation deals in aviation, security and research, among others.

""It's unprecedented, such a partnership with a third country,"" Barnier said. ""But the preliminary condition to that is that we have to organize an orderly withdrawal of the UK. That's the condition of the unprecedented partnership in the future.""

Junior Foreign Minister Alistair Burt is making the visit as Britain and other European signatories to the deal try to keep it alive, despite Trump's reimposition of sanctions on Tehran.
""As long as Iran meets its commitments under the deal, we remain committed to it as we believe it is the best way to ensure a safe, secure future for the region,"" Burt said in a statement before his visit. 
Burt will also discuss the cases of dual nationals detained in Iran.
Britain is seeking the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation. She was arrested in April 2016 at a Tehran airport as she was heading back to Britain with her daughter, now aged four, after a family visit.
Burt will meet Iranian ministers, including his counterpart Abbas Araghchi, and NGOs during his two-day visit when he will also discuss Iran’s role in conflicts in Syria and Yemen.

Around a dozen of the hundreds of Palestinians gathered in the village of Ras Karkar were injured, witnesses said. An Israeli police spokesman had no immediate comment.
An Israeli court broke new judicial ground on Tuesday by giving legal recognition to a Jewish settlement built without Israeli government authorization on privately owned Palestinian land.
Most countries consider all of the settlements built on land that Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war to be illegal. Israel disputes this.
Some 500,000 Israelis live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, areas that are also home to more than 2.6 million Palestinians. Palestinians say rapid settlement expansion in recent years could deny them a viable and contiguous state. 
The other Palestinian territory, Gaza, was largely quiet on Friday despite expected border demonstrations, a weekly event in the Islamist Hamas-controlled enclave since March 30. 
Israel has killed most than 170 Palestinians during the Gaza protests, in what it called an effort to thwart breaches of the fortified frontier. Israel withdrew settlers and soldiers from Gaza in 2005.

The last round of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks collapsed in 2014.

Merkel has raised the issue in recent days with both U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the German government is watching developments in the region with growing concern.
""We expect ... Russia to prevent the Syrian government from escalating the situation and thereby prevent a humanitarian catastrophe,"" Merkel's spokeswoman Ulrike Demmer told a regular government news conference.
She said it was imperative that humanitarian organizations be given unfettered access to the affected civilian population.
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said on Thursday government forces will ""go all the way"" in a planned offensive in Idlib, the last major insurgent bastion in Syria, and that Damascus's main targets were Islamist al-Nusra militants. 
But he said Syria would not use chemical weapons in any offensive and that it did not have such arsenal. Syria would try to avoid civilian deaths, Moualem added.
Russia, meanwhile, has said it will begin a major naval exercise in the Mediterranean on Saturday, a move that appeared to be aimed at deterring Western forces from carrying out strikes on Syrian government forces.
The United Nations has called on Russia, Iran and Turkey to delay a battle that could affect millions of civilians, calling for humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians.

Putin will attend a three-way summit in Tehran on Sept. 7 with the leaders of Turkey and Iran, his spokesman said.

347,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>",Germany warns on Serbia-Kosovo land swap idea,"By Robin Emmott
VIENNA (Reuters) - Germany warned on Friday that redrawing Serbia's border with Kosovo would fan ethnic tensions, but the EU's top diplomat said the bloc would abide by a deal if it respected international law.
Belgrade and Pristina have both this month raised the idea of redrawing their border.
Politicians and analysts in Belgrade say that a agreement allowing Serbia to maintain control over northern Kosovo, in exchange for the Presevo Valley, an ethnic Albanian-populated area in Serbia's south, could be acceptable to both sides, overcoming years of friction and allowing both nations to move towards EU membership. 
Arriving for a meeting between EU foreign ministers and their Balkan counterparts, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said discussions about territorial exchanges were wrongheaded.
""We believe that this can tear open too many old wounds in the population and so we are very skeptical,"" Maas told reporters. Other EU foreign ministers echoed his position, with Luxembourg's Jean Asselborn fearing ""very negative consequences"" and Finland's Timo Soini saying it was risky.
Britain has also warned land swaps could be destabilizing, but Serbia's Deputy Prime Minister Ivica Dacic said in Vienna that he was seeking a peaceful solution with Pristina, although he did not go into details. 
EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, who is leading mediation between Belgrade and Pristina, told a news conference after the meeting she would support land swaps as long as they avoided any attempt to create ethnically homogenous states. 
""Whatever outcome is mutually agreed will get our support provided it is in line with international law,"" she said. 
Kosovo's President Hashim Thaci told Reuters on Aug. 14 that he would present his plan to Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic when they meet in September in Brussels as part of a dialogue sponsored by the European Union.
Normalizing bilateral relations is a key condition for both Serbia and Kosovo to advance towards their eventual goal of EU membership. The Balkan neighbors agreed in 2013 to resolve all pending issues but have so far made little progress.
Kosovo, whose population of 1.8 million is mainly ethnic Albanian, declared independence from Belgrade in 2008, almost a decade after NATO air strikes ousted Serbian forces and halted a crackdown on ethnic Albanians during a brutal two-year counter-insurgency.
It is now recognized by more than 100 nations but not by Serbia, Russia and five EU states, including Spain. 
Most Serbs view Kosovo as the cradle of their nation and Orthodox Christian faith and Serbia, under its constitution, considers Kosovo an integral part of itself. 
Following Britain's decision to leave the European Union, the bloc is eager to show it is still expanding and wants to offer the six Western Balkans countries a path to EU membership.
Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia all hope to join the EU. Membership talks are already underway with Serbia and Montenegro. 

But France and the Netherlands unexpectedly delayed in June a decision to allow membership negotiations with Macedonia and Albania for fear of stocking anti-immigrant sentiment at home, making EU enlargement more difficult, officials say.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Sarah Mardini, one of two Syrian sisters who saved over a dozen refugees in 2015 by pulling their sinking dinghy to Greece, has been arrested for alleged people smuggling, her lawyer said on Friday. 
Greek police said on Tuesday they had arrested two members of an aid organization on the island of Lesbos and were investigating a total of 30 on suspicion they smuggled migrants into Greece, spied and laundered money.
Mardini, 23, who is being held in a maximum security prison in Athens, has denied all charges, her lawyer Haris Petsikos told Reuters. 
""She was strictly doing volunteer work. There is not a piece of evidence against her,"" he said.
The other person arrested is German national Sean Binder, 24, a volunteer who has lived most of his life in Ireland. He is also represented by Petsikos and also denies the charges. 
Authorities said the suspected crime gang allegedly ""provided direct assistance to organized migrant trafficking rings"".
They are accused of establishing and joining a criminal organization, money laundering, espionage, violating state secrets, counterfeiting and offences against the immigration code and electronic communication legislation.
Mardini, who settled in Germany and split her time between there and Greece, was not in Greece when some of the alleged crimes were committed, Petsikos said.
A date for a trial has not yet been set. Under Greek law, Mardini could be held for up to 18 months. 
Sarah Mardini and her younger sister Yusra, a UNHCR goodwill ambassador and swimmer who competed in the 2016 Rio Olympics with the first ever refugee team, fled Damascus in 2015 for Turkey.
They boarded an overcrowded dinghy to Greece and, when it began taking on water, jumped into the sea and dragged it for hours to Lesbos, saving the lives of 19 others.
Nearly a million Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis crossed to Lesbos from Turkey in 2015, at the height of Europe's refugee crisis, before traveling onwards to northern Europe. Dozens of aid groups operated on Lesbos at the time.

Hundreds of refugees and migrants have drowned trying to cross the narrow but dangerous stretch of water between Turkey and Greece.

However, in an email to Reuters they denied newspaper reports that they would make a full return to the institution that postponed awarding this year's prize due to the scandal.
""In Swedish media it has been portrayed that we are returning to work at the Swedish Academy. That's wrong. We could - possibly - participate in more important votes, nothing else,"" they said.
The email was signed by literary academic Sara Danius and writers Kjell Espmark and Peter Englund.
The three were among several Academy members who quit in April over the handling of allegations of sexual misconduct made against Jean-Claude Arnault, a photographer who is married to poet and Academy member Katarina Frostenson.
Arnault has repeatedly denied all the allegations against him, including of being the source of leaks of the names of some past winners before the formal announcements.
Several Swedish media had reported on Thursday that Danius, Espmark and Englund were making a return to the Academy.
In a further individual email to Reuters, Englund said he could possibly vote in the current election of new members, although he would not be attending any Academy gatherings. ""I wish to play a constructive role in the reconstruction of this institution,"" Englund said.
The resignations have left the headcount at the Academy, which was originally 18, at 10. It needs at least 12 present to vote for new members.

The government has already moved to revoke the concession from Autostrade, controlled by infrastructure group Atlantia, after a viaduct on one of its motorways collapsed in the port city of Genoa, killing 43 people.

Israel, which monitors neighboring Syria intensively, has long alleged that Iran came to assist the Damascus government in Syria's civil war in part to set up a permanent garrison there, including advanced missile factories and air and naval bases. 
The Israelis have carried out scores of air strikes in Syria targeting suspected arms and troop movements by Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas it sponsors. The Israeli actions have been mostly ignored by Russia, Damascus' big-power backer.
""The Iranians have reduced the scale of their activity in Syria,"" Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said in an interview published by Israel's top-selling Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper.
He said there was ""no activity, at this stage"", in Iranian efforts to build missile production factories on Syrian soil. 
""Nor have they built a port in Syria, and they have no airport there, but they have not abandoned the idea. They are continuing to negotiate with the Assad government on the creation of garrison outposts in Syria,"" Lieberman added.
""The main reason for why this has stopped is the result of our daily, hard work in Syria."" 
Iran, Israel's arch-enemy in the Middle East, has been a core supporter of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad throughout the 7-year war, sending military advisers as well as materiel and regional Shi'ite militias that it backs. 
This week, Iranian Defense Minister Amir Hatami visited Damascus and said the Islamic Republic would maintain its presence in Syria. The countries had signed a pact for defense cooperation, including to restore Syria's military industries.
Yedioth asked Lieberman whether Iran's conduct in Syria was linked to its economic crisis, precipitated by the restoration of U.S. sanctions after President Donald Trump exited world powers' 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran. 
""Obviously there is heavy economic pressure on them. The budget for Iranian forces in the Middle East was $2 billion, and even today less money is going to Syria and Hezbollah,"" he said. 

""I believe that when the second stage of the American economic sanctions starts, on November 4, the situation will get worse,"" he added, predicting that reduced funding for Hezbollah meant it ""will not be able to exist in its current format"".

354,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 06:50AM ET</span>","As EU divisions deepen, Macron stakes out electoral turf","By Michel Rose
PARIS (Reuters) - Emmanuel Macron's strategy for next year's European elections is taking shape and the French president sees it in stark terms - an open battle between anti-immigrant nationalists on the one hand and pro-EU 'progressives' on the other.
During a tour of Nordic countries this week, he was quick to take up the gauntlet thrown down by Italy's far-right Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who jointly labeled Macron their number one enemy.
""It is clear that today a strong opposition is building up between nationalists and progressives,"" Macron said when asked about the alliance struck between the two anti-immigrant leaders in Milan.
""If they want to see me as their main opponent, they are right to do so,"" he said.
Europe has seen a surge in support for far-right, anti-immigrant parties in recent national and regional elections, following a crisis that saw millions of people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa end up in Europe. 
Macron, a Europhile who during his French campaign said German Chancellor Angela Merkel had ""saved Europe's dignity"" by taking in one million refugees, has been cast by EU opponents as a soft touch on immigration, despite his hardline reputation on the issue at home. 
In Macron's view, that split will be the determining one when voters in 27 EU member states elect new members to the European Parliament next May, an election nationalists see as a prime opportunity to expand their influence and stymie ever-closer EU integration.
Having built his own movement to win the French presidency, confounding traditional parties of the left and the right, Macron is hoping to repeat the feat at the European level, even if doing so is a more risky and unpredictable task.
""Beyond Emmanuel Macron's European ideal, there's obviously a very strong political objective at stake in this battle between progressives and nationalists,"" said Bernard Sananes of polling institute Elabe.
""It's about having the National Front as the sole opponent, a sort of re-run of the second round (of the French presidential election) and attracting France's center-right movements towards his party,"" he said.
STRATEGY BUT FEW DETAILS
By framing the election in the terms he has, Macron hopes to draw to his camp other parties in EU member states, whether traditionally of the left or the right, who broadly share his centrist, liberal, pro-integration vision. 
Yet in doing so, he risks unsettling the traditional pillars of European politics, the center-right European People's Party, a bloc dominated by Angela Merkel's CDU/CSU, and the Socialists and Democrats, the bloc of the center-left.
And while Macron may have set out his broad strategy, details are lacking. It is not clear which parties from at least six other EU states he hopes to form a bloc with, and he has not designated a leader for his European ambitions.
Merkel on the other hand is keeping faith with the EPP, even if Orban and his Fidesz party remain members. She has reportedly backed Manfred Weber, the EPP's leader in the European Parliament, to be her candidate for the European Commission should the EPP win the elections.
DOMESTIC CHALLENGE
The battle Macron wants to fight in Europe he will also fight at home. His former presidential opponent, far-right leader Marine Le Pen, wants to turn the EU election into what she calls a choice between ""federalism and mass immigration and the Europe of free nations and identities"".
""The meeting between Orban and Salvini is seminal,"" she said on Twitter. She is hoping to draw Orban away from the EPP into her orbit, building a far-right bloc with the likes of Salvini's League and her current allies, Geert Wilders of the Netherlands and Germany's Alternative fur Deutschland.
Aside from the EPP and S&D, which hold a majority of the European Parliament's seats, there are currently six other groups, including ALDE, which traditionally represents liberal parties, many of which Macron will aim to attract.
Some on the left, such as Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom, a Social Democrat, seem tempted to join forces against the nationalists, apparently taking sides with Macron against Orban and Salvini in a tweet:
""I have one thing to say to them: bring it on,"" she wrote.
For Macron, building a loose, pan-European campaign of like-minded progressives is likely to be easier than pre-committing to traditional party alliances, his aides say. 
That will give him more flexibility come election night, when his followers in Strasbourg will be able to gauge each national contingent and decide who best to group with.

Depending on the size of that new bloc, Macron could have a strong voice in determining the next European Commission president, a job Merkel covets for Germany. That is, of course, if everything goes according to Macron's plan.

People demonstrated in different parts of Kampala, burning tires and piling rocks and other barricades in the middle of the roads. Police said the protests were limited and had been contained.
The lawmakers, Robert Kyagulanyi and Francis Zaake, say they were tortured by security forces while in detention. They were trying to leave to seek medical treatment abroad when they were arrested at Kampala's international airport on Thursday night.
Kyagulanyi's lawyer last week told Reuters that his client had been left unable to stand after being beaten while in detention. When he appeared in court a day after his lawyer spoke, he was unable to walk without help.
Government spokesman Ofwono Opondo last week dismissed the lawyer's comments as rubbish
Friday's demonstrations were most intense in Kamwokya, a suburb of Kampala where Kyagulanyi, a pop star known by his stage name Bobi Wine, has a recording studio, according to Dick Nvule, a local radio reporter.
""Protesters blocked the roads using garbage cans and burning tires. Motorists have to get alternative routes to the city center. Soldiers and riot police are still clearing the roads,"" Nvule told Reuters.
Police spokesman Luke Owoyesigyire said police were monitoring the city to ensure no illegal rallies took place.
The two parliamentarians were among a group of five lawmakers who were detained on Aug. 13 in Uganda's northwestern town of Arua and accused of throwing stones at a presidential convoy during the campaign for a parliamentary seat. 
Police said on Thursday they had stopped Kyagulanyi, who has been charged with treason but released on bail, as they awaited further guidance.
Zaake has not been charged but has been in hospital in Kampala. Images of him posted on social media show him lying on a bed, eyes closed, with multiple bruises on his hand and other body areas.
Kyagulanyi in particular has risen as a formidable threat to President Yoweri Museveni's 32-year rule, winning popular support through his music and strong criticism of the government.

357,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 06:38AM ET</span>",Abortion looms over Senate fight on Supreme Court nominee,"By Lawrence Hurley and Andrew Chung
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - When a U.S. appeals court last week rejected an Alabama abortion law, one of the court's judges bemoaned having to base the decision on Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion, calling it an ""aberration of constitutional law.""
The views of 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Chief Judge Ed Carnes, a Republican appointee to the Atlanta-based court, are shared by many conservatives opposed to the landmark 1973 ruling.
The big question is whether conservative U.S. appeals court judge Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump's nominee to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court, is one of them. 
The possibility he could vote to overturn Roe v. Wade will be a top line of questioning when Kavanaugh appears before a U.S. Senate panel for his confirmation hearing, starting on Tuesday. 
A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll last month found that 68 percent of Democrats believed abortion should be legal, while 61 percent of Republicans said the procedure in general should be illegal.. The issue has come to highlight the deep divide between the two parties.
Yet, some on both sides question whether Roe v. Wade could easily be overturned, given the Supreme Court's tradition of standing by its older decisions. Under a principle known as stare decisis, the court tries to protect its credibility by avoiding politicization and keeping the law evenhanded.
During an Aug. 21 meeting, Kavanaugh told Senator Susan Collins, a moderate Republican who favors abortion rights, that Roe v. Wade was ""settled law,"" she said afterward.
The court is currently split 4-4 between conservatives and liberals. Former Justice Anthony Kennedy, whom Kavanaugh would replace if he is confirmed by the Senate, disappointed fellow conservatives by affirming abortion rights in two key cases.
Still, precedents can be cast aside. For instance, just two months ago, the conservative majority, including Kennedy, overturned a major 1977 labor law precedent. The ruling came after two earlier rulings that undermined it.
""Rarely if ever has the court overruled a decision - let alone one of this import - with so little regard for the usual principles of stare decisis,"" liberal Justice Elena Kagan wrote in a dissenting opinion.
ROAD MAP FOR ROE
The stakes are high in the Senate battle over Kavanaugh because, if confirmed, he could provide a decisive fifth vote on the nine-justice court to overturn or weaken Roe v. Wade.
Doing that would likely prompt many conservative-leaning states to take steps to outlaw abortion altogether.
In the run-up to the Kavanaugh hearings, abortion rights groups have held rallies nationwide, while opponents of Roe v. Wade are optimistic that Kavanaugh will be on their side.
""I hope that there will be a future majority to overturn Roe, and I hope Kavanaugh would be among them,"" Clarke Forsythe, a lawyer with anti-abortion group Americans United for Life, said in an interview.
Abortion opponents could use the recent labor case decision as a road map to overturning Roe by taking up a series of abortion cases that would also criticize Roe's validity.
""Five years of decisions questioning (Roe) - that could change things,"" said John McGinnis, a law professor at Northwestern Pritzker School of Law. 
Most analysts expect a steady weakening of Roe as opposed to a quick reversal. ""They probably won't do it instantly, but they will probably get there eventually,"" said Carolyn Shapiro, a law professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law.
Trump pledged during the 2016 election campaign to appoint judges hostile to Roe v. Wade, a stance that won over social conservatives who helped him defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton.
The president's fellow Republicans narrowly control the Senate and can ensure Kavanaugh's confirmation if they avoid defections from their ranks.
NO DIRECT RULING 
When Trump named him in July as his Supreme Court nominee, Kavanaugh emphasized his Catholic faith. In a decade as a judge, he has not ruled directly on abortion, although he has signaled sympathy for legal arguments by anti-abortion advocates. 
If Kavanaugh is confirmed, the Supreme Court could soon wade back into the abortion debate. Legal battles over state bans on the procedure in early pregnancy are working through the courts. 
Amy Hagstrom Miller, founder and chief executive of Whole Woman's Health, which manages abortion clinics in several states, said she had spent her whole career working with the fate of Roe v. Wade hanging in the balance. 
Her clinic won the last major Supreme Court ruling on abortion in 2016, when the justices struck down strict regulations in Texas.

""This time I think Roe could fall,"" she said. ""But you have to stand up for what's right even when the odds are against you.""

YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar's armed forces released 75 children and young people from military service on Friday, the United Nations said, amid international outrage over alleged abuses committed by troops in the country's numerous ongoing conflicts.
Myanmar has now discharged 924 underage recruits since signing up to a joint action plan on child soldiers with U.N. agencies in June 2012, said Knut Ostby, the United Nations resident humanitarian coordinator for Myanmar, and June Kunugi, representative of the U.N.'s children's fund, Unicef, in a joint statement.
The discharge was ""one more positive development in the government’s effort to end and prevent the recruitment and use of children within the Tatmadaw,"" they said. 
Both the military - known as the Tatmadaw - and the ethnic guerrilla groups it has been fighting for decades have been blacklisted by the United Nations for using child soldiers. The United States took Myanmar off its list of the worst offenders in the use of child soldiers in 2017, before reinstating it this year.
The Tatmadaw and seven other groups remained ""'persistent perpetrators' in the recruitment and use of children in Myanmar,"" the United Nations said.
Spokespeople for the Myanmar military and the government were not immediately available for comment.
Myanmar's military was condemned internationally for human rights abuses including the recruitment of child soldiers during half a century of military rule. 
Allegations of abuses have continued to be leveled against Myanmar soldiers despite a transition from full military rule that saw Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi assume control over the civilian administration in 2016.
In the western Rakhine state, the military has launched harsh crackdowns in response to attacks by Rohingya Muslims insurgents since 2016, sending hundreds of thousands of Rohingya fleeing to neighboring Bangladesh.
U.N.-mandated investigators on Monday accused the army chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, of overseeing a campaign with “genocidal intent” against the Rohingya and recommended he and other senior officials be prosecuted.
The International Criminal Court is considering whether it has jurisdiction over events in Rakhine, while the United States, the European Union and Canada have sanctioned Myanmar military and police officers over the crackdown.

There was no need for the 2015 agreement between Iran and six world powers to be renegotiated, foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA).
""In the conditions when all of Iran's efforts with other world powers is nullified through the bullying and excessive demands of some of the partners of the French foreign minister and their own inability ... there is no reason, need, reliability or trust for negotiations on issues that are non-negotiable,"" Qassemi said.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Thursday that, following the U.S. pullout from the agreement, Tehran should be ready to negotiate on its future nuclear plans, its ballistic missile arsenal and its role in wars in Syria and Yemen. 
""French and international officials know well that Iran's regional policy is in pursuit of peace and regional and international security and combating terrorism and extremism,"" Qassemi said.
The agreement, reached after years of painstaking negotiations, limited Iran's nuclear development programs in exchange for an easing of sanctions.
Western powers had been concerned that Tehran was building towards nuclear weapons, although the Islamic Republic maintained the program was for peace purposes. U.S. President Donald Trump backed out of the agreement in May, throwing its survival into doubt.
Paris and Tehran have already locked horns this week. France told its diplomats and foreign ministry officials to postpone indefinitely all non-essential travel to Iran, citing a foiled bomb plot and a hardening of Tehran’s attitude towards France, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.

360,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 05:50AM ET</span>",Saudi official hints at plan to dig canal on Qatar border,"DUBAI (Reuters) - A senior Saudi official on Friday appeared to confirm local media reports that the kingdom is considering digging a canal to separate the Qatari peninsula from the mainland and turn it into an island, amid a year-long dispute between the neighbors.
""As a citizen, I am impatiently waiting for the details of the implementation of the East Salwa island project, this great historic project that will change the region's geography,"" Saud al-Qahtani, a senior adviser to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, wrote on Twitter.
Qatari authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Qahtani has mentioned the project on Twitter over the past few months, but Friday's tweet was the clearest reference yet to an initiative which critics dismiss as a public relations tactic aimed at intimidating Qatar rather than a serious plan.
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic, trade and transport ties with Qatar in June 2017, accusing it of supporting terrorism. Doha denies that charge and says the boycott is an attempt to impinge on its sovereignty.
The dispute has eluded mediation efforts by the United States and Kuwait, with both sides trying to secure the support of Western allies through diplomacy, media and business deals.
Reports about the canal first emerged on Sabq, a news website close to the government in April. Unnamed sources described Saudi plans to build a military base and a nuclear waste dump beside a 60 kilometer (37 mile) channel measuring 200 meters wide and 20 meters deep and stretching across the entire border with Qatar. 
The cost was estimated at 2.8 billion riyals ($747 million).
Further reports in the newspaper Makkah in June said Riyadh was moving ahead with the plans, with five unnamed companies invited to bid on the project and a winner to be announced in September.

362,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 05:45AM ET</span>",Germany to boost funds for Palestinians after U.S. cut,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The German government has pledged to significantly increase its funding for the U.N. agency that supports Palestinian refugees after the United States cut its aid.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said the funding crisis for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNWRA) was fueling uncertainty. 
""The loss of this organization could unleash an uncontrollable chain reaction,"" he said.
Germany had already provided 81 million euros ($94 million) in aid for UNWRA this year, he said, and was preparing to increase its contribution. He gave no figure. 
""We are currently preparing to provide an additional amount of significant funds,"" Maas said in a letter to European Union foreign ministers that was seen by Reuters. 
Maas said it was clear that the added German funds would not cover a $217 million deficit left by the U.S. withdrawal, and urged the European Union and other states to work toward ""a sustainable finance basis for the organization"".
It is part of a broader push by Maas to take a more assertive stance in disagreements with the United States on a range of issues including trade, military spending and climate change.
Jordan said on Thursday it would lead a campaign to raise funds to help the U.N. agency survive, including an appeal to the Arab League.
UNRWA has faced a cash crisis since the United States, long its biggest donor, earlier this year slashed funding, saying the agency needed to make unspecified reforms and calling on the Palestinians to renew peace talks with Israel.
The agency was founded in 1949 after the first Arab-Israeli war, in the wake of the exodus of around 700,000 refugees who fled or were driven out of Israel on its founding as a state.

UNRWA now looks after more than 5 million people in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

363,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>","French, UK fishermen to seek scallops deal after sea skirmishes","By Geert De Clercq and Julie Carriat
PARIS (Reuters) - Fishing industry officials from France and Britain will try to strike a new deal on dredging for scallops next week following violent skirmishes in the Channel, authorities said on Friday. 
On Tuesday, French vessels rammed British trawlers off the coast of Normandy, hurling projectiles and insults in a dispute which erupted after a previous agreement broke down.
French fishermen accuse the British of unfairly catching scallops in the Baie de Seine in the summer months when French boats are banned from doing so under rules imposed by the Paris government to conserve stocks of the shellfish.
French Agriculture Minister Stephane Travert told Europe 1 radio he had discussed the issue with a British minister on Thursday night and that the industry representatives would meet next week to work out an agreement.
""We both condemn the violent acts and we want to return to a spirit of responsibility,"" Travert said. 
Travert said he had asked British fisheries minister George Eustace to ensure UK vessels do not sail south of the Barfleur-Antifer line, the scene of this week's clashes.
Dimitri Rogoff, the head of the Normandy fishing association, said the industry officials would meet in London on Wednesday and French government officials would also attend.
Scallops - known as Coquilles Saint Jacques in France - are one of a handful of species whose catch is governed by national rather than European Union regulations.
While British ships have no access to French territorial waters up to 12 nautical miles (22 km) off the coast, they can legally operate in the expansive Baie de Seine between Cherbourg and Le Havre.
France bans its fishermen from scallop dredging between May 15 and Oct. 1, but Britain allows its vessels to operate year-round.
After similar clashes in 2012, French and British fishing organizations negotiated an agreement each summer under which the UK fleets do not start scallop dredging in the Baie de Seine before the French, in exchange for part of the French fishermen's dredging permits.
But small British vessels were excluded from that agreement. The French say the British have undermined the spirit of the deal by sending more and more small vessels. In protest, the French have not signed any agreement this year.
British fisherman face losing access to EU waters after the country leaves the bloc next year, in the absence of any deal.
Rogoff said that ahead of Brexit, British fishermen had increased scallop trawling, risking wiping out the seafood during their breeding season. 

""The British scallop harvest has grown more than tenfold in the past decade, they now catch more than we do,"" he said, adding that by the time the season opens in October there are few scallops left for the French fleet.

More than 80 percent of EU citizens wanted to abolish the EU's switch and favored keeping the time used in summer for the whole year, Jean-Claude Juncker said on German television, adding he would put the plan to a debate among EU commissioners.
""We will decide that today,"" Juncker said. ""Millions ... believe that summertime should be all the time.""
Any change would still need approval from national governments and European Parliament to become law.
EU law requires that citizens in all 28 EU countries move their clocks an hour forward on the last Sunday in March and switch back to winter time on the final Sunday in October.
But Finland, with the most northerly EU national capital, this year called for the EU to halt the practice, which critics say it can cause long-term health problems, especially among young children and elderly people. 
Research has shown that the time change disrupts sleep schedules and can impact productivity at work.
Supporters say making the switch to give extra morning daylight in winter and evening light in summer can help reduce traffic accidents and save energy.

Outside the EU, a handful of European countries have stopped switching between summer and winter time, including Russia, Turkey, Belarus and Iceland.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - While many Indonesians have been cheering on the athletes at the Asian Games, which began in their country on Aug. 18, some have been mourning loved ones killed in a security crackdown aimed at ensuring a trouble-free sports festival.
Police killed at least 11 people in the run-up to the games, which finish on Sunday, in a brazen campaign against crime that has shocked human rights groups 20 years after democracy was ushered in after decades of authoritarian rule.
At least one bereaved family is demanding answers over the death of their relative at the hands of police, who provided few details about how and why the young man was killed.
""I believe he was tortured and shot,"" said a close relative of the victim. The relative declined to be identified, citing security worries.
Reuters could not independently verify the details of the shooting.
The victim had a criminal record and had spent time in jail, but family members described him as ""loyal and helpful"".
Police returned the body in a closed casket and seemed intent on preventing the family from examining it, the relative said.
But they did and found that the dead man had a sewn-up gunshot wound near his heart, bruises on his face and what they took to be cigarette burns on his arms.
Police told Reuters the suspect was shot after he tried to ""grab an officer's gun"" as he was being led to another suspect's house. They did not explain the other injuries.
Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher at Human Rights Watch, said a failure to investigate such killing would ""reinforce a deeply rooted culture of impunity in Indonesia"".
During preparations for the games, Indonesia suffered its deadliest militant attack in more than a decade, when suicide bombings killed at least 30 people in the city of Surabaya, putting the country on edge.
While anti-terrorism authorities focused on the militant threat, police made no bones about their aim to prevent ordinary crime from marring the biggest multi-sport event outside the Olympics.
'JUST SHOOT THEM' 
National police chief Tito Karnavian ordered his officers in early July to ""act firmly and quickly"" even against petty criminals in advance of the games.
""If they resist, shoot them. Don't hesitate, just shoot them,"" the Antara state news agency quoted Karnavian telling an Asian Games security coordination meeting.
The month-long crackdown was focused on the capital, Jakarta, neighboring cities and South Sumatra where games venues were also located.
Dozens of suspects were shot, at least 11 of them died, according to police figures. Some rights workers and media have put the death toll higher.
Hundreds of people were detained - all on suspicion of carrying out petty crimes like stealing motorcycles or pickpocketing, police said.
Jakarta police spokesman Argo Yuwono has said the force acted according to standard procedure and suspects were only shot if deemed ""a danger to officers or to other people"". 
But Indonesia's ombudsman has questions.
""There are irregularities and we have questions that need to be answered,"" said Nyoto Budi, coordinator of investigations at the ombudsman, which has no legal authority over the police but can recommend prosecution.
The ombudsman has asked police for details of the killings, including forensic reports, the identify of officers involved and investigation files.
The bereaved family that Reuters contacted submitted an anonymous complaint to the national commission of human rights this week, with the help of the Jakarta Legal Aid Foundation.
A police spokesman did not respond to requests for comment on the complaint.
The victim's relative said that on the day of his death, police handed the family an envelope that an officer said contained a ""compassionate donation"". 
But the family refuses to open it. 

""I can't accept his death until I get the truth,"" the relative said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea said on Friday it will dispatch special envoys to the North Korean capital on September 5 to discuss the timing of a summit between the two countries' leaders expected to take place later in the month.
The special envoy will also discuss ""establishing peace,"" ""advancing inter-Korean ties,"" and the ""denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,"" said Kim Eui-kyeom, a spokesman for South Korea's presidential Blue House.
The South had earlier on Friday proposed sending the envoys, and the North accepted, Kim said. 
He did not identify who the envoys would be.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in would be the first South Korean president to visit Pyongyang since 2007, but the planned summit has been overshadowed by signs of mounting tension between North Korea and the United States over the future of the North's nuclear weapons program.
Last week U.S. President Donald Trump abruptly called off a visit to Pyongyang by his secretary of state and his own newly named special envoy for North Korea, complaining of a lack of progress in denuclearization talks.
The cancellation came just hours after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had announced the planned visit and publicly acknowledged for the first time that his efforts to get Pyongyang to denuclearize had stalled.
Trump later hailed his personal relationship North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and rowed back on suggestions by Secretary of Defence Jim Mattis that the United States might resume war games with South Korea.
North Korean state media has also been critical of the United States, complaining that Washington was failing to live up to promises to revamp the two countries' relations.
North Korea has been seeking relief from tough international sanctions and a formal conclusion to the 1950-1953 Korean War, which ended in an armistice rather than a peace treaty.
The first meeting between Moon and North Korea's Kim Jong Un in Panmunjom in April was the high point of a remarkable thaw in ties after more than a year of rising tension and fears of war over the North’s development of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. 
At that meeting, they agreed that Moon would visit the North’s capital in the autumn, though the pair met again in May in an unannounced meeting, also in Panmunjom.

369,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 04:30AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Iran moves missiles to Iraq in warning to enemies,"By John Irish and Ahmed Rasheed
PARIS/BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iran has given ballistic missiles to Shi'ite proxies in Iraq and is developing the capacity to build more there to deter attacks on its interests in the Middle East and to give it the means to hit regional foes, Iranian, Iraqi and Western sources said.
Any sign that Iran is preparing a more aggressive missile policy in Iraq will exacerbate tensions between Tehran and Washington, already heightened by U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of a 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.
It would also embarrass France, Germany and the United Kingdom, the three European signatories to the nuclear deal, as they have been trying to salvage the agreement despite new U.S. sanctions against Tehran.
According to three Iranian officials, two Iraqi intelligence sources and two Western intelligence sources, Iran has transferred short-range ballistic missiles to allies in Iraq over the last few months. Five of the officials said it was helping those groups to start making their own.
""The logic was to have a backup plan if Iran was attacked,"" one senior Iranian official told Reuters. ""The number of missiles is not high, just a couple of dozen, but it can be increased if necessary.""
Iran has previously said its ballistic missile activities are purely defensive in nature. Iranian officials declined to comment when asked about the latest moves.
The Iraqi government and military both declined to comment.
The Zelzal, Fateh-110 and Zolfaqar missiles in question have ranges of about 200 km to 700 km, putting Saudi Arabia's capital Riyadh or the Israeli city of Tel Aviv within striking distance if the weapons were deployed in southern or western Iraq.
The Quds Force, the overseas arm of Iran's powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), has bases in both those areas. Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani is overseeing the program, three of the sources said.
Western countries have already accused Iran of transferring missiles and technology to Syria and other allies of Tehran, such as Houthi rebels in Yemen and Lebanon's Hezbollah. 
Iran's Sunni Muslim Gulf neighbors and its arch-enemy Israel have expressed concerns about Tehran's regional activities, seeing it as a threat to their security.
Israeli officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the missile transfers.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday that anybody that threatened to wipe Israel out ""would put themselves in a similar danger"".
MISSILE PRODUCTION LINE
The Western source said the number of missiles was in the 10s and that the transfers were designed to send a warning to the United States and Israel, especially after air raids on Iranian troops in Syria. The United States has a significant military presence in Iraq.
""It seems Iran has been turning Iraq into its forward missile base,"" the Western source said. 
The Iranian sources and one Iraqi intelligence source said a decision was made some 18 months ago to use militias to produce missiles in Iraq, but activity had ramped up in the last few months, including with the arrival of missile launchers. 
""We have bases like that in many places and Iraq is one of them. If America attacks us, our friends will attack America's interests and its allies in the region,"" said a senior IRGC commander who served during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. 
The Western source and the Iraqi source said the factories being used to develop missiles in Iraq were in al-Zafaraniya, east of Baghdad, and Jurf al-Sakhar, north of Kerbala. One Iranian source said there was also a factory in Iraqi Kurdistan. 
The areas are controlled by Shi'ite militias, including Kata'ib Hezbollah, one of the closest to Iran. Three sources said Iraqis had been trained in Iran as missile operators.
The Iraqi intelligence source said the al-Zafaraniya factory produced warheads and the ceramic of missile moulds under former President Saddam Hussein. It was reactivated by local Shi'ite groups in 2016 with Iranian assistance, the source said.
A team of Shi'ite engineers who used to work at the facility under Saddam were brought in, after being screened, to make it operational, the source said. He also said missiles had been tested near Jurf al-Sakhar.
The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon declined to comment.
One U.S official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that Tehran over the last few months has transferred missiles to groups in Iraq but could not confirm that those missiles had any launch capability from their current positions.
Washington has been pushing its allies to adopt a tough anti-Iran policy since it reimposed sanctions this month.
While the European signatories to the nuclear deal have so far balked at U.S. pressure, they have grown increasingly impatient over Iran's ballistic missile program. 
France in particular has bemoaned Iranian ""frenzy"" in developing and propagating missiles and wants Tehran to open negotiations over its ballistic weapons.
Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Thursday that Iran was arming regional allies with rockets and allowing ballistic proliferation. ""Iran needs to avoid the temptation to be the (regional) hegemon,"" he said. 
In March, the three nations proposed fresh EU sanctions on Iran over its missile activity, although they failed to push them through after opposition from some member states.
""Such a proliferation of Iranian missile capabilities throughout the region is an additional and serious source of concern,"" a document from the three European countries said at the time. 
MESSAGE TO FOES
A regional intelligence source also said Iran was storing a number of ballistic missiles in areas of Iraq that were under effective Shi'ite control and had the capacity to launch them.
The source could not confirm that Iran has a missile production capacity in Iraq.
A second Iraqi intelligence official said Baghdad had been aware of the flow of Iranian missiles to Shi'ite militias to help fight Islamic State militants, but that shipments had continued after the hardline Sunni militant group was defeated.
""It was clear to Iraqi intelligence that such a missile arsenal sent by Iran was not meant to fight Daesh (Islamic State) militants but as a pressure card Iran can use once involved in regional conflict,"" the official said. 
The Iraqi source said it was difficult for the Iraqi government to stop or persuade the groups to go against Tehran.
""We can't restrain militias from firing Iranian rockets because simply the firing button is not in our hands, it's with Iranians who control the push button,"" he said. 
""Iran will definitely use the missiles it handed over to Iraqi militia it supports to send a strong message to its foes in the region and the United States that it has the ability to use Iraqi territories as a launch pad for its missiles to strike anywhere and anytime it decides,"" the Iraqi official said.
Iraq's parliament passed a law in 2016 to bring an assortment of Shi'ite militia groups known collectively as the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) into the state apparatus. The militias report to Iraq's prime minister, who is a Shi'ite under the country's unofficial governance system.

However, Iran still has a clear hand in coordinating the PMF leadership, which frequently meets and consults with Soleimani.

Turnbull last week said he would resign from parliament after he was ousted from office in a bitter party-room contest which ushered in the country's sixth leader in the last decade.
""The speaker of the house of parliament received a resignation letter from Malcolm Turnbull this afternoon,"" said a source familiar with the matter. The source declined to be named as she is not authorized to talk to the media.
Until a by-election can be contested, Australia's new Prime Minister Scott Morrison is left relying on the support of independent lawmakers to pass legislation, inhibiting the government's agenda just eight months out from an election.
Besides no longer having a majority in the lower house of parliament, the government does not control the upper house Senate.
According to the latest opinion polls Australia's ruling Liberal-National coalition will struggle to be re-elected in a poll due by May 2019.
After a tumultuous Liberal party leadership battle last week, the two-party-preferred vote between the opposition Labor party and the coalition blew out 56-44 in favor of Labor, which would translate into a heavy election defeat.
Parliament is currently in recess, resuming on Sept. 10.
A by-election is unlikely to held until the end of September at the earliest, leaving Morrison without a majority for at least the next two-week sitting of parliament.
Morrison paid tribute to his predecessor while in Jakarta for talks with his Indonesian counterpart on a free trade deal that could be signed later this year.
""I just want to send to my friend Malcolm, and to Lucy (his wife), and to their entire family all my best wishes and all my love,"" Morrison told reporters.

MBABANE (Reuters) - While China meets African leaders at a major summit in Beijing next week, the king of eSwatini, self-ruled Taiwan's last remaining ally on the continent, will be hosting thousands of people at a traditional Reed Dance ceremony.
By offering loans and upping diplomatic pressure, Beijing has flipped one African country at a time to its side, most recently Burkina Faso, in May. But eSwatini has stuck with Taiwan, which Beijing claims as a wayward province.
""They are our major partner,"" eSwatini Foreign Affairs Minister Mgwagwa Gamedze said, referring to Taiwan. ""So they (China) must forget about having us in their stable.""
Despite some domestic criticism that only the royal family benefits from ties to Taipei, eSwatini looks set stand by its old friend far away in East Asia.
eSwatini government spokesman Percy Simelane, who also speaks on behalf of the king, said Taiwan had been good to them.
""The people of eSwatini have been benefiting from the cordial relations existing between Taiwan since independence 50 years ago. The nation is benefiting and by extension as expected the leader benefits,"" he said. 
""Taiwanese doctors continue to be pillars of our health system. To say it is the king alone who benefits is a projection of political bankruptcy on the part of the accuser,"" he said.
Chinese President Xi Jinping is likely to use the Africa summit to offer a generous new round of aid and loans to the continent.
eSwatini's King Mswati III will be at home, hosting thousands of young Swazi women celebrating chastity in a lavish week-long ceremony for Africa's last absolute monarch.
""Everywhere in the world, culture is the soul of a nation, only a political imbecile would put a regional meeting above the soul of the nation,"" Simelane said.
China has been upping the pressure on the country formerly known as Swaziland ahead of the summit, with a senior Chinese diplomat saying last week they expect them to come over to Beijing soon.
China has been chipping away at democratic Taiwan's remaining allies, now down to just 17, almost all poor countries in Central America and the Pacific. 
Taiwan says relations are firm. Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen visited in April.
The King has not commented on the diplomatic tussle. He went to Taiwan in June, attending military drills and the graduation of one of his sons, who had been studying there.
Since 1975, Taiwan has been spending big on projects, including a hospital, a rural electrification project and a new airport.
    
'ISOLATED STATE'
Critics say eSwatini's ties with Taiwan have also benefited the king, who this year took delivery of an Airbus A340-300 from Taiwan's China Airlines, which was refurbished in Germany.
""Is the country really benefiting from an isolated state?"" said Petros Magagula, a political science lecturer at the University of eSwatini, questioning how beneficial Taiwan was.
""The leadership benefits from ties with Taiwan.""
Asked about the suggestion that eSwatini would benefit from ties with China, Taiwan's Foreign Ministry told Reuters: ""Taiwan has a deep, friendly and stable relationship with eSwatini ... and the two countries' future cooperation prospects are optimistic.""
""Taiwan's government will also help improve the lives of eSwatini's people in any ways that it can,"" the ministry said.
An economist who works for the government said eSwatini should align with China, the world's second biggest economy.
""I don't understand why are we stuck with Taiwan. A number of African countries that have joined China have seen their economies flourish,"" said the economist, who declined to be identified.
In July, China said it would invest $14.7 billion in South Africa, which almost completely surrounds eSwatini.
""It benefits Mswati and the royal family financially,"" said Njabulo Dlamini, a senior official of the Communist Party of Swaziland, referring ties with Taiwan. 

The party has been banned for being aligned to China.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - A Cambodian court jailed an Australian filmmaker for six years on Friday after finding him guilty of espionage for flying a drone over an opposition party rally.
James Ricketson, 69, was arrested last June after he was photographed flying the drone above the rally organized by the now-dissolved opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) before communal elections.
Ricketson was charged with espionage, although it remains unclear for whom he was spying. His family called the court sentence an ""absolute tragedy"". 
""The Phnom Penh Municipal Court has decided to convict James Ricketson and sentences him to six years in prison for espionage and collecting information that is harmful to the nation between December 2010 and June 2017,"" Judge Seng Leang said.
Ricketson, who has spent more than a year behind bars after his bail was denied, appeared in court wearing a pink prison uniform and holding a copy of the thriller book 'The Faithful Spy' by Alex Berenson.
Speaking in court after the verdict, Ricketson expressed disbelief. ""Which country was I conducting espionage for?"" he asked.
""James is almost 70 and is not in good health, our family is very scared about what will happen to him in there if things take a turn for the worst,"" Ricketson's family said in a statement following the verdict, referring to Phnom Penh's Prey Sar prison where Ricketson has been jailed.
""James is not a spy. James loves Cambodia and the Cambodian people. He is a filmmaker and a humanitarian,"" the family said.
During hearings that began last week the prosecution argued that Ricketson's work had damaged Cambodia's reputation on the world stage. 
Ricketson has been visiting Cambodia for more than 20 years, producing documentaries about the country and its people.
Ricketson's son, Jesse Ricketson, said the court's decision was an ""absolute tragedy"".
""It's very difficult to imagine what the future holds now for my dad. I'm absolutely terrified for him,"" he added. 
""We are really looking for a lot more support moving forward from the new Australian government,"" Ricketson's nephew, Bim Ricketson, told reporters in Sydney.
Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that Ricketson can expect further consular assistance and that the government had previously approached Cambodia directly about the case.
""As usual with these types of events, it's best I think to deal with these things calmly, directly and in a way that best assists the citizen,"" he told reporters in Jakarta.
'EXCESSIVE CHARGES'
In a letter to Cambodia's long-serving Prime Minister Hun Sen last month, Ricketson apologized for statements to media that were disrespectful to Hun Sen.
Ricketson's arrest came amid a wider crackdown on freedom of expression by Hun Sen's government and his Cambodian People's Party (CPP). 
The CPP last month claimed victory following a controversial general election which was largely unopposed. 
Rights groups said the July 29 vote was neither free nor fair given the absence of a significant challenger to Hun Sen, who has ruled for 33 years.
Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said the trial exposed flaws in Cambodia's judicial system.

""This trial exposed everything that's wrong with the Cambodian judicial system: ridiculously excessive charges, prosecutors with little or no evidence, and judges carrying out political orders from the government rather than ruling based on what happens in court,"" Robertson said in a statement.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's military wants record spending next year to help pay for major upgrades to defenses designed to shoot down North Korean ballistic missiles that Tokyo sees as a continued threat despite Pyongyang's promise to abandon nuclear weapons.
The Ministry of Defence budget proposal released on Friday calls for defense spending to rise 2.1 percent to 5.3 trillion yen ($48 billion) for the year starting April 1.
If approved, it will be the seventh straight annual increase as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reinforces Japan's military to respond to any North Korea missile strike and counter China's growing air and sea power in the waters around Japan.
The proposed defense budget still has to face scrutiny by Ministry of Finance officials who may seek to curtail any rise in military outlays to secure funds for Japan's burgeoning health and welfare spending.
The biggest proposed outlay in the military budget will be on ballistic missile defense, with a request for 235 billion yen for two new powerful ground-based Aegis Ashore radar missile tracking stations built by  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT). 
Japan's military also wants funds to buy longer-range Raytheon Co SM-3 interceptor missiles designed to strike enemy missiles in space and money to improve the range and accuracy of its PAC-3 missiles batteries that are the last line of defense against incoming warheads.
Japan remains wary of North Korean promises to abandon its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. The Ministry of Defence said in a white paper published on Tuesday Pyongyang remained Japan's ""most serious and pressing threat"". 
Other big buys include six Lockheed Martin F-35 stealth fighters for 91.6 billion yen and two E-2D Hawkeye early warning patrol planes built by  Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC). Japan's Maritime Self Defence Force also wants funding to build two new destroyers and a submarine worth a combined 171 billion yen.
Purchases of American-made equipment could help Tokyo ease trade friction with Washington as U.S. President Donald Trump pushes Japan to buy more American goods, including military gear, while threatening to impose tariffs on Japanese auto imports to cut a trade imbalance with Tokyo.

The defense ministry's latest budget request comes ahead of a possible meeting between Abe and Trump in September, when the Japanese leader is expected to attend the United Nations in New York.

377,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 01:00AM ET</span>",New Zealand PM Ardern has two ministers step aside,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has had to strip one minister of her portfolio and had another step aside in less than a week, capping off a month of challenges for the popular premier since her return from maternity leave.
Ardern said in an emailed statement that Minister of Customs Meka Whaitiri was temporarily standing down during an investigation into a ""staffing matter"", adding that neither she nor Whaitiri would comment until it was completed.
Last Friday, Ardern said digital services minister Clare Curran would step down after failing to declare a meeting with a candidate for the government's Chief Technology Officer job.
In an emailed statement at the time, Curran said, ""I take full responsibility for not following proper process. The meeting...should have been in the diary and my staff should have been informed.""
Curran remains Minister for Communications and Broadcasting in the center-left coalition government, but is no longer in the senior ranks of government ministers.
""It's absolutely a problem for the government with this because it creates the perception of turbulence and perhaps even...unreadiness to govern,"" said Bryce Edwards, analyst at Wellington-based Critical Politics. 
""It is entirely unusual to have two ministers in serious trouble in a week.""
An opinion poll released on Aug 5 showed Ardern's personal popularity was historically high as she returned from six weeks of maternity leave, but she has since faced a number of political and economic challenges.
Business confidence has plummeted to 10-year lows since the coalition government took office late last year, sparking concern it could drag on economic growth.
The Colmar Brunton poll in early August showed support for Ardern's Labour party at 43 percent, a slip of 1 percentage point, while her governing partners, New Zealand First and the Green Party, picked up a percentage point each.

As in last year's election, the poll showed the center-right National Party was the most popular, with 45 percent support. It had been unable to gain the support of minor parties to form the government last year.

378,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 11:40PM ET</span>",Duterte says Philippines better off run by dictator if he were not around,"MANILA (Reuters) - President Rodrigo Duterte has said graft and illicit drugs were so entrenched in the Philippines that if he were not around, it would be better off run by a dictator such as late strongman Ferdinand Marcos.
In a speech on Thursday, Duterte reiterated that he wanted to quit before his term ends in 2022, but was reluctant to hand power to Leni Robredo, the vice president who was elected separately and was not his running mate.
Robredo has been a critic of the president's deadly war on drugs. Duterte said there would be disorder if his crackdown was halted, and the Philippines could do with an authoritarian at the helm.
""You're better off choosing a dictator of the likes of Marcos, that's what I suggested,"" Duterte said. ""Constitutional succession, it's Robredo. But she cannot hack it.""
Duterte's expressed admiration for the much-vilified Marcos has been controversial, with many Filipinos still tormented by his brutal two-decade rule, ended in his overthrow in a popular, army-backed uprising in 1986.
Thousands of people were arrested, killed, tortured or disappeared under martial law in the 1970s.
Many survivors are reminded of that by the political influence wielded by the Marcos family, with widow Imelda a congresswoman, his son and namesake a former senator who lost to Robredo in the 2016 vice presidential election, and daughter, Imee Marcos a provincial governor.
Imee Marcos, 62, is expected to run for the senate next year and attends or speaks at many of Duterte's public events around the country, despite having no role in his administration.
She caused outrage last week when she said it was time for older Filipinos to ""move on"" from the martial law years, like younger ones had.
The mercurial Duterte, 73, has been talking more often about retiring, due to exasperation about corruption and narcotics. Rumors have spread that he is in declining health, which he dismissed on Thursday as ""fake news"".
In the same speech, he said that amid turmoil in the Catholic church worldwide, he wanted to create an ""opening"" at home for victims to reveal abuse by priests, which he personally had experienced. 
He again joked about rape, despite repeated rebukes from women's groups at home and abroad. 

Commenting on police data showing his home city, Davao, had the country's highest number of rape cases, Duterte said there would be more when there were ""many beautiful women"".

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The Catholic church in Australia on Friday rejected laws forcing priests to report child abuse when they learn about it in the confessional, setting the stage for a showdown between the country's biggest religion and the government.
The Australian Catholic Bishops Conference (ACBC), the country's top Catholic body, said it did not accept a recommendation from an official inquiry into church abuse which would force priests by law to report abuse to the police when they hear about it in confession.
One state and a territory in Australia have since introduced laws making it a crime for priests to fail to report abuse heard in the confessional, while the other five states and remaining territory have said they are considering their response.
""The Council ... continues to support retention of the civil law protection for the seal of the confessional,"" the ACBC said in a report published on Friday.
""Children will be less rather than more safe if mandatory reporting of confessions were required,"" the report added.
Addressing reporters, ACBC President Mark Coleridge said the seal of confession was ""a non-negotiable element of our religious life and embodies an understanding of the believer and God"".
Last year, Australia completed a five-year government-appointed inquiry into child sex abuse in churches and other institutions, amid allegations worldwide that churches had protected pedophile priests by moving them from parish to parish.
The inquiry heard that seven percent of Catholic priests working in Australia between 1950 and 2010 had been accused of child sex crimes and that nearly 1,100 people had filed child sexual assault claims against the Anglican Church over 35 years.
The ACBC published its report two weeks after a former Australian archbishop became the most senior Catholic cleric in the world to be convicted of concealing abuse, and was ordered to serve a one-year prison sentence at home.
The convicted former archbishop of Adelaide, Philip Wilson, himself a former ACBC president, was found to have failed to report child abuse outside the confessional. He has said he will appeal the conviction.
Accusations of covering up abuse in the Catholic church have reverberated all the way to Pope Francis, who has been accused by a United States archbishop of knowing for years about sexual misconduct by an American cardinal and doing nothing about it.

A staunch U.S. ally, Australia has been on heightened alert from 2015 for attacks by home-grown militants returning from fighting in the Middle East, and its intelligence agencies have stepped up scrutiny.
The 25-year-old was arrested on Thursday in Sydney, charged with preparing a terror offense and is in custody while his home and workplace at a university are searched, New South Wales police official Mick Sheehy told reporters. 
""From the documentation, he would affiliate with ISIS,"" Sheehy added, using an acronym for militant group Islamic State.
""There is a number of locations and individuals named in that document who are potential targets,"" Sheehy, a detective acting superintendent, said of the notebook, adding that it needed further analysis.
The man did not have the ""capability"" to launch an attack, however, he said, and ruled out any threat to the public.
Reuters was not immediately able to trace contacts for the man's lawyer, or other representatives, to seek comment.
Authorities say Australia's vigilance has helped to foil at least a dozen plots, including plans to attack downtown Melbourne at Christmas in 2016 and a plot to blow up a flight from Sydney to Abu Dhabi.
In Dec. 2014, two hostages were killed during a 17-hour siege by a ""lone wolf"" gunman, inspired by Islamic State militants, in a cafe in Sydney.

381,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 09:01PM ET</span>",First Yellowstone-area grizzly hunt in 40 years blocked by federal judge,"By Laura Zuckerman
(Reuters) - A federal judge in Montana on Thursday issued a court order temporarily blocking the first trophy hunts of Yellowstone-area grizzly bears in more than 40 years, siding with native American groups and environmentalists seeking to restore the animals' protected status.
The 14-day restraining order by U.S. District Judge Dana Christensen in Missoula, Montana, came two days before Wyoming and Idaho were scheduled to open licensed grizzly hunts allowing as many as 23 bears in the two states to be shot and killed for sport.
Groups opposing the hunts had sought a restraining order while waiting for the judge to rule on the larger question of whether the federal government should return Endangered Species Act safeguards to grizzlies in the greater Yellowstone region.
Christensen heard arguments from both sides on Thursday and took the case under advisement without indicating when he would render a decision. But in granting the restraining order, he said that the conservation and tribal groups had shown that they were ""likely to succeed on the merits"" of their lawsuits.
Wyoming and Idaho had been scheduled to open their newly established hunting season for grizzlies outside Yellowstone National Park starting on Saturday.
U.S. law prohibits hunting altogether inside the park, and Montana has decided against opening a grizzly season, citing concerns about long-term recovery of a bear population that is arguably one of the most celebrated and photographed in the world.
The stage for grizzly hunting in the region was set in June 2017 when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced that the large, hump-shouldered bears would cease to be listed as a threatened species in and around Yellowstone. That left grizzly management to the discretion of the states, and prompted lawsuits challenging the action.
The decision by the Trump administration on the de-listing, formally proposed in 2016 during the Obama era, was based on agency findings that the bears' numbers have rebounded enough in recent decades that federal protections are no longer necessary.
'SACRED BEING'
Grizzlies in the Lower 48 states number fewer than 2,000 bears, compared to an historic high of 100,000 before extermination campaigns brought their numbers to just several hundred by 1975, when they came under the Endangered Species Act.
The de-listing decision last year applied to about 700 Yellowstone-area grizzlies in Wyoming, Idaho and Montana. Environmentalists argue that treating those bears separately from other grizzly populations in Montana and elsewhere was biologically unsound and illegal under the Endangered Species Act.
  Renny MacKay, spokesman for Wyoming's Game and Fish Department, said the state would abide by the court's decision.
  U.S. wildlife managers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Native Americans revere the grizzly as sacred.

  ""It's essential to protecting our religious and spiritual freedoms, and treaty rights in Yellowstone,"" said Stan Grier, chief of the Piikani Nation and president of the Blackfoot Confederacy Chiefs. ""This sacred being is considered to be a deity by many tribes, not a rug.""

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's business-friendly presidential candidate Geraldo Alckmin unveiled a campaign ad against gun violence on Thursday that targeted his far-right pro-gun adversary Jair Bolsonaro.
The ad, copied from a British ad used in the 2007 ""Guns kill: Kill guns"" campaign, shows a bullet smashing through a glass of milk, books and fruit, stopping before a child's head with the message ""Bullets are not the solution.""
The front-runner for the Oct. 7 election, Bolsonaro advocates easing gun controls to allow Brazilians to own guns and defend themselves from criminals, besides giving police carte blanche to shoot and kill armed suspects.
His hardline law-and-order approach has struck a chord with Brazilian voters fed up with a rising wave of violent crime in their cities and widespread corruption among its leaders.
Bolsonaro is leading all opinion polls if you exclude jailed former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who is expected to be barred from running by a graft conviction.
An opinion poll published on Thursday by Poder360 political news website showed Lula has 30 percent of voter support followed by Bolsonaro with 21 percent, and Alckmin tied in third place with center-leftist Ciro Gomes and environmentalist Marina Silva.
Bolsonaro, who defends Brazil’s 1964-1985 military dictatorship, said on Globo TV on Tuesday that a policeman who kills ""10, 15 or 20 (criminals) with 10 or 30 bullets"" should be decorated and not put on trial. 
In a country that had a record 61,000 murders last year, Alckmin hopes his opposition to Bolsonaro's plan to arm the population will draw a large pool of undecided voters in Brazil's most uncertain election in decades.
Alckmin will drive home that message when election ads are allowed on television during the last 35 days of the campaign starting on Friday.
The former four-time governor of Sao Paulo state has put together a nine-party coalition that will allow him more time on television to reach out to voters than all 12 other candidates put together. 
His poor performance so far in the race has disheartened investors who see Alckmin as the best bet to rein in Brazil's $40 billion primary budget deficit and restore confidence in Latin America's largest economy.

Concerns over Brazil's political future weakened the Brazilian currency 1.25 percent on Thursday to 4.16 reais to the dollar, accumulating a 20.4 percent decline this year.

383,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 08:43PM ET</span>",Dam nation: Big state projects spared in China's hydro crackdown,"By David Stanway
LESHAN, China (Reuters) - In a mountain village in southwest China's Sichuan province, authorities have demolished seven small dam projects this year along a river to clear illegal developments in a new nature reserve.
The demolition is part of a nationwide program to close hundreds of tiny and often ramshackle dams and turbines and bring order to China's massive hydropower sector after years of unconstrained construction.
The dams sat on an unnamed tributary of the fierce and flood-prone Dadu river, which feeds into the Yangtze, Asia's largest and longest river, where the government says the ""irregular development"" of thousands of small hydropower projects has wrecked the ecology.
(For a series of pictures, please click here: https://reut.rs/2N3xvlz)
But green groups say the campaign will not necessarily save the environment because it will not affect big state hydropower stations, which they say have caused the most damage.
On the Zhougong river, another tributary, seventy-year-old farmer Zhang, who declined to give his full name, reckons big dams have devastated the ecology. Zhang described himself as a ""hydropower migrant"" after his land was inundated by state dam builders 10 years ago.
He said changes in the Zhougong's flow and temperature had devastated the local fish population, with one species favored by the Sichuan-born former leader Deng Xiaoping now wiped out.
""The fish here now taste terrible, and are fit only for dogs,"" he said, pointing to three silver carp he had caught after they were swept down river by flood waters from an upstream reservoir.
China triggered an aggressive damming program 20 years ago as it looked for ways to develop industry and bring electricity to poor rural regions not connected to the power grid.
Investors rushed in and environmentalists likened the frenzy to the construction of backyard steel smelters during the ill-fated 1958 ""Great Leap Forward"", a program that aimed to industrialize China's agrarian society but caused widespread famine as farmers made metal instead of food.
Now, the government wants to reverse course and the environmentally conscious leadership must decide how much of China's 100 gigawatts of small-scale capacity needs to close, while at the same time protecting expensive state investments.
""Hydropower was a good thing at the time, but as is often the case in China, it turns into a swarm and we basically lose control,"" said Chen Guojie, a hydropower expert with the China Academy of Sciences in Chengdu, central China.
Sichuan underlines the case. Total hydropower reached more than 75 GW in 2017, greater than the total in most Asian countries. It was also more than double the capacity of the province's power grid, meaning lots of wasted power.
China's official hydropower capacity was about 340 GW at the end of June and around a third of that is considered small hydropower, projects of less than 50 MW. China's overall power capacity, including coal and nuclear plants, is 1,740 GW.
SIZE MATTERS
In June, state auditors identified 24,100 small hydropower projects in the 11 regions along the Yangtze, and said the environmental costs of some plants were too high even though they had made ""historical contributions"" to development.
A month later, Beijing ordered the regions to ban new construction and ""rectify"" illegal projects, although it remains uncertain how many will be decommissioned.
""There is no unified standard, and we still aren't clear which small-scale plants should be demolished and which ones retained,"" said Yang Yong, chairman of the Hengduan Mountain Research Society, a Sichuan-based environmental group.
The government says small dams have disrupted the habitats and breeding patterns of many rare species of fish, although green groups argue the damage wrought by bigger dams is more severe, with entire towns and ecosystems submerged in water, which they say increases the risk of earthquakes, landslides and even climate change.
On the 30-mile (48 km) Zhougong, authorities have already demolished small projects built in nature reserves or encroaching upon new ""ecological red lines"" drawn up to shield a quarter of China's territory from development.
But the river houses 10 larger stations run by some of the country's biggest firms, including Guodian, Huadian and the State Grid Corp, and the ""overdevelopment"" of the river was criticized by the environment ministry earlier this year. 
None of the firms, or their local subsidiaries, responded to requests for comment.
Central government-run utilities have long urged regulators to crack down on small poorly planned dams, which they say have eroded their own profits.
Hengduan's Yang suspects small plants are being shut down to free up grid access for bigger dams.
""These small hydropower plants originally had grid agreements, and if they were legal, they could connect,"" he said. ""If they can't access the grid because there are many big plants, that isn't right.""
As far as Zhang the farmer is concerned, big hydro has already squeezed the life from the Zhougong, on which people have depended for decades.

""Tens of thousands of people have made their living here, but soon it won't be possible,"" he said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A long-exiled Mexican union leader stormed back onto the political stage on Thursday as a newly-minted senator, saying his legal troubles were behind him and pledging to help President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador defeat poverty.
Miners' union leader Napoleon Gomez returned to cheering crowds of union supporters this week after more than a decade of self-imposed exile in Canada, where he fled after the Mexican government accused him of stealing $55 million from a union trust fund. Judges cleared him of criminal wrongdoing in 2014.
Flanked by international labor leaders, Gomez spoke to dozens of reporters cramped into a hotel terrace news conference. 
""We were exonerated of all the false accusations, slander and lies,"" the 74-year-old Gomez said. ""This issue has been totally put behind us and now we want to move forward.""
Alongside him sat labor chiefs from North America and Europe, including Len McCluskey, head of Britain's biggest trade union Unite, and an ally of Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn. McCluskey lauded Gomez as a brave defender of workers' rights.
Gomez said it was a ""disgrace"" that workers' wages that were once much higher in Mexico than in China, were now lower.
The Oxford-educated Gomez won office as a hand-picked candidate for Lopez Obrador's Morena party on the Senate seats awarded under proportional representation rules.
The alliance bolsters Lopez Obrador's support from organized labor, following his endorsement by Mexico's main teachers' union. Both unions were once supporters of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, he defeated in the July 1 election.
Gomez dodged a question on whether he would release financial records of the mining and steelworkers union he heads, but hinted he could pursue defamation suits against some of his most prominent critics, including billionaire German Larrea, chief executive of Mexican mining company Grupo Mexico.
Gomez vowed to stay in charge of the union, which his father led for four decades before him, during his six-year term. Before being sworn in as a senator on Wednesday, he was cheered by thousands of union members outside the Senate.

As the news conference ended, several burly men wearing union shirts blocked the exit, saying attendees had to wait inside until Gomez and his entourage had left from a separate door.

TAOS, N.M. (Reuters) - A New Mexico district attorney vowed on Thursday to reinstate child abuse charges against three defendants from a remote compound after a procedural fumble by his team led to their release, sparking a public outcry.
After a storm of criticism and insults on social media against his two prosecutors, District Attorney Donald Gallegos appealed for the public to stop ""cussing and threatening."" 
""Our options are to re-file the charges or take the case to the grand jury,"" Gallegos said in a statement. ""What is important to know is that we will continue to pursue prosecution of the cases.""
Prosecutors John Lovelace and Timothy Hasson have accused the Muslim defendants, who are all related by blood or marriage, of planning attacks on schools and other ""corrupt institutions.""
None of the five defendants has been formally charged with those allegations. The prosecutors, as well as two judges who dismissed charges on Wednesday, have been pilloried on social media for allowing ""Muslim extremists"" to walk free.
Judge Emilio Chavez ordered charges dropped against Lucas Morton, his wife, Subhannah Wahhaj, and her sister Hujrah Wahhaj because prosecutors failed to schedule a preliminary hearing within a legally mandated 10-day period after they were taken into custody.
RECOVERING BELONGINGS
The three faced 11 counts of child abuse and neglect after police raided their ramshackle settlement north of Taos on Aug. 3 and said they found 11 children with no food or clean water. Three days later, they found the body of a 3-year-old at the site.
Those three spent their first full day out of jail on Thursday trying to recover a white truck, wallets, keys, clothes and other possessions left at the settlement, according to a person familiar with the situation who asked not to be named.
Judge Jeff McElroy also dismissed child abuse charges against Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, the father of the boy whose body was found, and his partner, Jany Laveille, over the ""10-day rule"" failure.
Ibn Wahhaj and Laveille, who were members of the compound, remain in custody facing separate charges for taking the brain-damaged toddler from his biological mother in Georgia and allegedly causing his death on Dec. 24 by denying him anti-seizure medicine. The two remained silent when asked to enter a plea on Wednesday. The court entered pleas of not guilty.
Defense attorneys for the couple have declined to comment specifically on the toddler's death but say their clients are being discriminated against because they were black Muslims carrying out a faith-healing ritual.
Attorneys for the three defendants who were released said they expected new indictments could come through a grand jury in September.

386,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 06:01PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Fake photos in Myanmar army's 'True News' book on the Rohingya crisis,"By Poppy McPherson
YANGON (Reuters) - The grainy black-and-white photo, printed in a new book on the Rohingya crisis authored by Myanmar's army, shows a man standing over two bodies, wielding a farming tool. ""Bengalis killed local ethnics brutally"", reads the caption.
The photo appears in a section of the book covering ethnic riots in Myanmar in the 1940s. The text says the image shows Buddhists murdered by Rohingya - members of a Muslim minority the book refers to as ""Bengalis"" to imply they are illegal immigrants.
But a Reuters examination of the photograph shows it was actually taken during Bangladesh's 1971 independence war, when hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshis were killed by Pakistani troops.
It is one of three images that appear in the book, published in July by the army's department of public relations and psychological warfare, that have been misrepresented as archival pictures from the western state of Rakhine.
In fact, Reuters found that two of the photos originally were taken in Bangladesh and Tanzania. A third was falsely labeled as depicting Rohingya entering Myanmar from Bangladesh, when in reality it showed migrants leaving the country.
Government spokesman Zaw Htay and a military spokesman could not be reached for comment on the authenticity of the images. U Myo Myint Maung, permanent secretary at the Ministry of Information, declined to comment, saying he had not read the book.
The 117-page ""Myanmar Politics and the Tatmadaw: Part I"" relates the army's narrative of August last year, when some 700,000 Rohingya fled Rakhine to Bangladesh, according to United Nations agencies, triggering reports of mass killings, rape, and arson. Tatmadaw is the official name of Myanmar's military.
Much of the content is sourced to the military's ""True News"" information unit, which since the start of the crisis has distributed news giving the army's perspective, mostly via Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
The book is on sale at bookstores across the commercial capital of Yangon. A member of staff at Innwa, one of the biggest bookshops in the city, said the 50 copies the store ordered had sold out, but there was no plan to order more. ""Not many people came looking for it,"" said the bookseller, who declined to be named.
On Monday, Facebook banned the army chief and other military officials accused of using the platform to ""inflame ethnic and religious tensions"". The same day, U.N investigators accused Senior General Min Aung Hlaing of overseeing a campaign with ""genocidal intent"" and recommended he and other senior officials be prosecuted for crimes against humanity.
In its new book, the military denies the allegations of abuses, blaming the violence on ""Bengali terrorists"" it says were intent on carving out a Rohingya state named ""Arkistan"".
Attacks by Rohingya militants calling themselves the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army preceded the military's crackdown in August 2017 in Rakhine state, in which the U.N. investigators say 10,000 people may have been killed. The group denies it has separatist aims. 
The book also seeks to trace the history of the Rohingya - who regard themselves as native to western Myanmar - casting them as interlopers from Bangladesh.
In the introduction to the book the writer, listed as Lieutenant Colonel Kyaw Kyaw Oo, says the text was compiled using ""documentary photos"" with the aim of ""revealing the history of Bengalis"".
""It can be found that whenever a political change or an ethnic armed conflict occurred in Myanmar those Bengalis take it as an opportunity,"" the book reads, arguing that Muslims took advantage of the uncertainty of Myanmar's nascent democratic transition to ignite ""religious clashes"".
Reuters was unable to contact Kyaw Kyaw Oo for comment.
Reuters examined some of the photographs using Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Reverse Image Search and TinEye, tools commonly used by news organizations and others to identify images that have previously appeared online. Checks were then made with the previously credited publishers to establish the origins of those images. 
Of the 80 images in the book, most were recent pictures of army chief Min Aung Hlaing meeting foreign dignitaries or local officials visiting Rakhine. Several were screengrabs from videos posted by Rohingya militant group the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army.
Of eight photos presented as historical images, Reuters found the provenance of three to be faked and was unable to determine the provenance of the five others.
One faded black-and-white image shows a crowd of men who appear to be on a long march with their backs bent over. ""Bengalis intruded into the country after the British Colonialism occupied the lower part of Myanmar,"" the caption reads.
The photo is apparently intended to depict Rohingya arriving in Myanmar during the colonial era, which ended in 1948. Reuters determined the picture is in fact a distorted version of a color image taken in 1996 of refugees fleeing the genocide in Rwanda. The photographer, Martha Rial, working for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, won the Pulitzer Prize.
The newspaper did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the use of its photo. 
Another picture, also printed in black-and-white, shows men aboard a rickety boat. ""Bengalis entered Myanmar via the watercourse,"" the caption reads.

Actually, the original photo depicts Rohingya and Bangladeshi migrants leaving Myanmar in 2015, when tens of thousands fled for Thailand and Malaysia. The original has been rotated and blurred so the photo looks granular. It was sourced from Myanmar's own Ministry of Information.

If other member parties follow the chancellor in backing Weber, who currently heads the center-right European People's Party caucus in the European Union's legislature, he would be front-runner to succeed Jean-Claude Juncker as head of the European Commission.
That would make the 46-year-old Bavarian the EU's day-to-day leader as it attempts to navigate a world in which a Donald Trump-led United States is seen as an unreliable partner, it faces a stiff challenge from Russian and Chinese rivals and reinvents itself following Britain's departure from the bloc.

Merkel, who as leader of the EU's most populous and wealthiest country would have considerable influence over the EPP's choice of the center-right's ""Spitzenkandidat"", or candidate for president of the European Commission, is believed to want to see a German appointed to head the bloc's executive.
It has been decades since a German has headed the Brussels-based Commission, whose 30,000 staff draft and enforce legislation and has been instrumental in driving the process of European integration since the bloc's beginnings in 1957.
German newspapers reported that Merkel had agreed after meetings with EPP President Joseph Daul in Berlin this week to throw her weight behind Weber, a Bavarian conservative.
News magazine Der Spiegel reported that Weber was currently lobbying to win other member parties' support in Brussels ahead of a Helsinki congress at which the candidate would be chosen in November.
While Merkel's backing will likely dash any other Germans' hopes of winning the nomination, other widely mooted candidates remain in the race, including the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, France's Michel Barnier.

While Weber is an ally of Merkel, his Bavarian Christian Social Union party is well to her right on social policy, and he is seen as an ally of strongman East European leaders like Hungary's Viktor Orban, outspoken critics of Brussels' supposed desire for deeper European integration.

KAMPALA (Reuters) - Ugandan police detained two lawmakers, one of whom is also a pop star, at the country's sole international airport, where supporters say they were trying to seek treatment abroad for injuries suffered while being tortured by the security forces.
Allegations that Robert Kyagulanyi and Francis Zaake were tortured have triggered widespread protests in the capital Kampala and other parts of the country.
The two were among a group of five lawmakers that were detained on August 13 in Uganda's northwestern town of Arua, accused of throwing stones at a presidential convoy during the campaign for a vacant seat in parliament. Kyagulyani is a pop star, known by his stage moniker Bobi Wine.
President Yoweri Museveni, in power since 1986, has repeatedly been accused by his opponents of rights abuses and widespread use of security personnel to suppress opposition to his rule. He denies that his government carries out abuse.
""The Uganda Police halted the departure of the Hon. Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu at Entebbe International Airport,"" police tweeted late on Thursday. ""Given the fact that he is on bail, the police is concerned and await for guidance from the relevant government department.""
In a separate statement on Thursday police said they had also found Zaake at Entebbe early on Thursday, ""trying to flee the country and accordingly apprehended him.""
Kyagulanyi in particular has emerged as a formidable threat to Museveni's 32-year rule, winning popular support through his music and strong criticism of the government. 
In the days after the lawmakers were detained, allied politicians and relatives said the two were tortured and both needed to be taken outside the country for specialized medical care.
Kyagulanyi, who has been charged with treason alongside several others for his role in the stoning incident, used crutches in court appearances and was transported in an ambulance at times. His supporters say he was beaten with a metal bar while in detention.
Zaake has not been charged but has been at a hospital in the capital Kampala, with images of him posted on social media showing him lying on a bed, eyes closed, with multiple bruises on his hand and other body areas. 
Police said he had been taken to the country's national referral hospital in Kampala where he would be treated under custody. He would be charged ""at an appropriate time"" with offences from the stoning of the presidential convoy.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, on his first tour of Latin America since taking office in June, on Thursday offered any necessary support to push forward a peace deal between Colombia and ELN rebels.
Colombia's new President Ivan Duque, who is evaluating whether to continue the peace talks, said in a joint news conference with Sanchez that he will happily consider Spain's offer if rebels stop all violence and criminal activity.
""Anything Colombia needs from Spain to consolidate and advance peace we will say yes to. We will be with our Colombian brothers so that this will be a reality sooner rather than later,"" leftist Sanchez said.
Sanchez is on a four-nation trip that began on Monday in Chile, one of five guarantor nations at the talks with the ELN currently taking place in Cuba. 
In his inaugural speech on Aug. 7 right-wing Duque said he would review the negotiations, which began in February 2017, and make a decision within 30 days.
""If there's a suspension of criminal activities, a will for peace, we very much welcome the offer that has been made by our good friend President Pedro Sanchez,"" Duque said.
The ELN, founded by radical Catholic priests, has waged a five-decade war against the government, engaging in bomb attacks, kidnapping, extortion and sabotage of economic infrastructure like oil pipelines.
In an interview on Thursday with Spanish news agency EFE, ELN leader Pablo Beltran said the group was grateful for Spain's offer of help.
Sanchez drew comparisons with Spain's troubles with Basque separatist group ETA, which fought for independence from Spain in an armed conflict that stretched from 1959 to 2011. 
""Spain has also suffered terrorist violence, has also suffered the migration of many people from certain regions of our country because of not switching to the ideology of the terrorist band,"" he said.
The ELN is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union. ETA was also designated as terrorist group by the United States and EU.
Colombia's long conflict, which also involves right-wing paramilitaries and crime gangs, has killed some 260,000 people and displaced millions. Colombia signed a peace accord in late 2016 with the bigger rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
Sanchez also praised Colombia's ""extraordinary"" humanitarian efforts in helping Venezuelan migrants.
Colombia has borne the brunt of the exodus of hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans escaping hyperinflation and shortages of basic goods under socialist President Nicolas Maduro. 
""I want to recognize the humanist commitment of President Duque,"" Sanchez said.
He said the European Union would give Latin America 35 million euros to help with the crisis. 
After a meeting in Lima on Thursday between Colombia, Peru and Ecuador, a Peruvian official said aid to countries taking in migrants from Venezuela must increase in tandem with the higher number of arrivals.
Latin American countries have repeatedly called on Maduro to enact democratic reforms and accept international aid.
Last week, the United Nations migration agency said the situation was building toward a ""crisis moment"" comparable to events involving refugees in the Mediterranean.

Sanchez next travels to Costa Rica.

390,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 05:00PM ET</span>","Colombia, Peru, Ecuador seek aid to cope with Venezuelan migrants","LIMA (Reuters) - Colombia, Peru and Ecuador want more international aid to help manage a surge in Venezuelan migration that is overwhelming public services in those countries, a Peruvian official said on Thursday.
""Support has been given and we value it, but it has to increase in line with increasing migration,"" said Cesar Bustamante, an official at Peru's foreign ministry who met with representatives of Colombia and Ecuador on Wednesday in Lima. 
""More demand for public services means more resources. There's no way around it. We have to provide those services, with our own resources or with international help,"" he said in a telephone interview.
Bustamante said developed countries should do more to support United Nations programs that are assisting migrants in South America and should offer funds to countries hosting them.
Colombia, Peru and Ecuador have accepted hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans fleeing an economic meltdown, growing poverty and food and medical shortages at home.
The United Nations has said that more than 1.6 million Venezuelans have left the country since 2015 in one of the largest mass migrations in Latin American history.
In Peru, Venezuelans receive attention at state-funded health clinics and attend public schools, and the government's immigration agency is processing residency requests around the clock.
Last week, United Nations' agencies dealing with migration and refugees called for more help for host countries to handle a crisis it said was approaching a level comparable to the influx of refugees in the Mediterranean.
On Thursday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who is on a four-nation Latin American tour, said in Bogota that the European Union would give Latin America 35 million euros to help with the migrant crisis.
The United States has given nearly $31 million in aid for Venezuelans since fiscal year 2017, as well as $18.5 million for Colombia, home to more Venezuelan migrants than any other country, the U.S. State Department has said.
However, the United States has not eased its immigration policy to accommodate more Venezuelans, underscoring new challenges in the developing world as U.S. President Donald Trump shifts the burden of hosting desperate migrants and refugees to places with less capacity to absorb them.
Last week, Peru's foreign minister said that he had spoken with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about funding needs.
Colombia, Peru, Ecuador discussed Venezuelan immigration in Lima on Wednesday at a gathering of the Andean Community, one of a number of regional meetings aimed at tackling migration issues. 
In a joint statement, the three countries called on Caracas to facilitate passports for Venezuelan citizens to strengthen regional security. Bolivia, an ally of Venezuela's president Nicolas Maduro, attended Wednesday's meeting as the fourth member of the Andean Community, but it did not sign the joint statement.
Peru started requiring passports instead of national ID cards from Venezuelans on Saturday, following a similar decision by Ecuador. 

Some 1,200 Venezuelans per day entered Peru after the new rule was implemented, down from 5,100 earlier this month, according to Peru's immigration agency. The figure included migrants as well as aspiring refugees, who do not require passports for entry under international law.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court declined on Thursday to force the city of Philadelphia to resume the placement of children in need of foster care with a Catholic agency that refuses to accept gay couples as foster parents.
In a decision that Catholic Social Services had said would force its foster care program to close, the justices refused the religious agency's request for an injunction compelling the city to allow it to place children in foster homes while litigation over the dispute continues in lower courts.
In the brief order that did not give any reasons for the decision, three conservative members of the court, Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, said they would have granted the agency's request.
Five of the nine Supreme Court justices are needed to grant an injunction, but the court is one member short since Justice Anthony Kennedy retired at the end of July. The court is split 4-4 between liberal and conservative justices. President Donald Trump has nominated conservative federal appeals court Judge Brett Kavanaugh to replace Kennedy. 
""We hoped for a different decision today,"" said Lori Windham, a lawyer at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which represents the agency. She said she was encouraged that three justices agreed with their position. 
The dispute arose last March after the city suspended referrals with Catholic Social Services following a newspaper report on the agency's policy to turn away same-sex couples. 
At issue is Catholic Social Services' policy of refusing to perform home studies on same-sex couples to evaluate and certify them as foster parents, which it says would amount to a written endorsement of same-sex marriage, according to court papers. 
The case underscores increasing tensions in the United States between advocates for religious groups seeking exemptions from anti-discrimination laws, and gay rights proponents who say such exemptions would be a license to discriminate. 
Legal fights are brewing in several U.S. states over laws allowing private agencies to block gay couples from adoptions or taking in foster children.
The Supreme Court legalized gay marriage nationwide in a landmark 2015 decision.
Philadelphia says that as part of its foster care contract with Catholic Social Services, the agency must follow a city anti-discrimination law, which covers sexual orientation. 

Catholic Social Services, which is part of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, filed suit in federal court arguing that the city had violated its religious and free speech rights under the U.S. Constitution.

In a published statement he said he would never personally stop his campaign against Islam but the risk to innocents, and of attacks on the Netherlands, stemming from the proposed contest were too great.
""My point about the intolerant nature of Islam has been proved again by this,"" he said.
Earlier this week, Dutch police arrested a 26-year-old man suspected of threatening to attack Wilders over his plan.
Meanwhile, in Pakistan thousands of people demonstrated against the contest, in a march organized by Islamist party Tehreek-e-Labbaik, which also called on Pakistan and other Islamist countries to sever all ties with the Netherlands.
In Afghanistan, the Taliban urged Afghan soldiers on Thursday to attack Dutch troops serving in the NATO-led Resolute Support mission in retaliation for what it called a blasphemous action and a hostile act by the Netherlands against all Muslims. The Afghan Taliban statement was issued shortly before Wilders canceled the contest.
Images of Prophet Mohammad are traditionally forbidden in Islam as idolatrous. Caricatures are regarded by most Muslims as highly offensive.
In 2005, Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten published cartoons of Prophet Mohammad that sparked a wave of protest across the Muslim world and several attempts to kill either its editor or cartoonist Kurt Westergaard.
Ten years later, a pair of Islamists stormed the offices of magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris, known for publishing satirical cartoons of the Prophet, and killed 12 people.
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte last week defended Wilders' right to stage the contest, saying it fell within the boundaries of freedom of speech, but also stressed the plan was not a government initiative.

Wilders' anti-Islam Freedom Party became the second largest in the Netherlands at last year's general elections, but is not part of the government. Wilders had planned to hold the contest in his party's offices in the parliament building.

The men, 21 and 53, had been detained at the police station in the town of San Vicente Boqueron in the state of Puebla. A crowd pulled them from their cell, beat them and set them on fire on Wednesday, the state government said in a statement.
""Nearly 150 angered residents broke the door (...) taking out the two individuals,"" the statement said. 
The state prosecutor's office discarded accusations the victims had committed any crime and said authorities had opened a homicide investigation of their deaths.
Images on social media showed the moment a furious crowd doused the men in gasoline and set them alight. 
Local media quoted relatives of the men who said they were farm workers who had come to the town to buy supplies.
Mexico occasionally sees such killings. Rising criminal violence and growing frustration with ineffective police forces have been blamed for fueling such attacks.

BOSTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Thursday backed a lawsuit accusing Harvard University of discriminating against Asian-American applicants, throwing its support behind a case that could impact the use of race-based college admissions.
The department, which has been investigating Harvard for potential civil rights violations over its affirmative action policy, made its argument in documents filed in federal court in Boston, where the case is scheduled to go to trial in October.
The Justice Department argued that Harvard had failed to prove that its use of race as a factor in deciding which students to admit had not resulted in it illegally discriminating against Asian-Americans.
Instead, the department said the evidence in the lawsuit by Students for Fair Admissions showed Harvard's admissions process ""significantly disadvantages"" Asian-Americans compared with other groups.
""No American should be denied admission to school because of their race,"" U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement.
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Harvard said in a statement that it was ""deeply disappointed"" by the department's action and will defend the right of colleges to consider race as an admissions factor.
Supporters of Harvard, including the American Civil Liberties Union, assailed the Trump administration's decision to intervene in the case, with some calling the department's position an assault on efforts to promote campus diversity.
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that universities may use affirmative action to help minority applicants get into college. Conservatives have said such programs can hurt white people and Asian-Americans.
In 2016, the top court rejected a challenge to a University of Texas program designed to boost the enrollment of minority students. The challenge was brought by a white woman.
SFFA is headed by prominent anti-affirmative action activist Edward Blum, who found the woman in the 2016 case. Harvard has called SFFA a ""litigation vehicle designed to advance the ideological objectives of its founder.""
After President Donald Trump, a Republican, took office last year, the Justice Department began investigating whether Harvard's policies are discriminatory because they limit Asian-Americans' acceptance.
In court papers, SFFA claimed an Asian-American male applicant with a 25 percent chance of admission would have a 35 percent chance if he were white, 75 percent chance if he were Hispanic and 95 percent chance if he were black.

A Harvard research division found in 2013 that over a decade Asian-American admission rates were lower than those for whites annually even though whites outperformed Asian-American applicants only on a subjective personality rating, the SFFA said.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Iran has remained within the main restrictions on its nuclear activities imposed by a 2015 deal with major powers, a confidential report by the U.N. atomic watchdog indicated on Thursday.
In its second quarterly report since President Donald Trump announced in May that the United States would quit the accord and reimpose sanctions, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran had stayed within the caps on uranium enrichment levels, enriched uranium stocks and other items.
In its last report in May, the IAEA had said Iran could do more to cooperate with inspectors and thereby ""enhance confidence"", but stopped short of saying the Islamic Republic had given it cause for concern. Thursday's report to member states seen by Reuters contained similar language.
It said the Vienna-based U.N. nuclear watchdog was able to carry out all so-called complementary access inspections needed to verify Iran's compliance with the deal.
""Timely and proactive cooperation by Iran in providing such access facilitates implementation of the Additional Protocol and enhances confidence,"" said the report, which was distributed to IAEA member states.
""The production rate (of enriched uranium) is constant. There is no change whatsoever,"" a senior diplomat added. 
With the United States reimposing its sanctions on Iran that were lifted under the nuclear deal, many diplomats and analysts now doubt that the accord will survive despite European Union efforts to counter some of the effects of Trump's move.
Sticking to the nuclear accord is not the only way forward for Iran, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Thursday. ""Being the party to still honor the deal in deeds & not just words is not Iran's only option,"" he said on Twitter.
Speaking after the IAEA report was sent to the agency's member states, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said the deal was still holding, despite the U.S. withdrawal. 
He urged his fellow ministers, who met in Vienna on Thursday to discuss EU policy on Iran, to do more to protect Tehran from U.S. sanctions, calling for ""permanent financial mechanisms that allow Iran to continue to trade"". 
The EU implemented a law this month to shield European companies from the impact of U.S. sanctions on Tehran and has approved aid for the Iranian private sector, although large European companies are pulling out of Iran.
Adhering to the deal should bring Iran economic benefits, Zarif said. ""If preserving (the) JCPOA (the deal) is the goal, then there is no escape from mustering the courage to comply with commitment to normalize Iran's economic relations instead of making extraneous demands,"" Zarif wrote on Twitter.
On Wednesday, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei cast doubt on the ability of EU countries to save the agreement and said Tehran might abandon it.
Khamenei told President Hassan Rouhani not to rely too much on European support as he came under increased pressure at home over his handling of the economy in the face of U.S. sanctions, with key ministers under attack by parliament.
Le Drian, whose country signed the Iran deal along with Britain, Germany, China, Russia and the United States under then-President Barack Obama, said Tehran should be ready to negotiate on its future nuclear plans, its ballistic missile arsenal and its role in wars in Syria and Yemen.
Those issues were not covered by the 2015 deal and Trump has cited this as a major reason for pulling Washington out of it. 
Le Drian said Iran, which says its missiles are only for defense, was arming regional allies with rockets and allowing ""ballistic proliferation,"" adding: ""Iran needs to avoid the temptation to be the (regional) hegemon.""
Iran has ruled out negotiations on its ballistic missiles and broader Middle Eastern role.

(Reuters) - Chile's most senior cleric has apologized for the ""tension"" affecting the country's Roman Catholic Church after five bishops resigned in a sexual abuse scandal that has prompted a major civil investigation.
Ricardo Ezzati, the Archbishop of Santiago, told colleagues at an internal church event on Tuesday that the Catholic church was facing a ""completely unprecedented situation,"" according to the text of his speech posted on the archbishopric's website. 
""The terms to describe this situation are well-known: pain, shame, anger, indignation, tension,"" he said. 
""We are living in a tense time within the country and the Church. We have contributed to that tension with our problems and our crimes.""
Ezzati was due to be questioned as a suspect by a civil prosecutor this month in the alleged cover-up of sex abuse in the Chilean Catholic church, but his lawyers have requested more time to prepare.
The Chilean catholic church scandal, in which prosecutors say hundreds of children could have been abused, has been echoed worldwide in the biggest crisis of Pope Francis' career. 
This week, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, the papal envoy in Washington from 2011 to 2016, published a letter in which he claimed the pope had known for years of allegations of sex abuse by a prominent U.S. cardinal, and called on him to resign.
""It wasn't news,"" Ezzati said in response to the claims. ""It is not difficult to find brothers of faith, priests, laity members who openly denounce their bishops, their brother priests.
""Bishops accused of cover-up, on crimes, laity who declare themselves to be the Church and say they don't need pastors. However, without a doubt all of these things tell us that we need some time and spiritual wisdom to be able to discern what has happened.""
The crisis has gripped Chile's Catholic Church since 2011, when Chilean priest Fernando Karadima was found guilty by the Vatican of abusing children in the 1970s and 1980s. The allegations prompted a probe that has led to the ousting of bishops and other priests.
All of Chile's 34 bishops offered to resign en masse in May after attending a meeting with the pope over allegations of a cover-up.
A Vatican official said after resignations of three Chilean bishops in June that the pope was considering the positions of the other prelates. 

Chilean civil authorities have said they are investigating 36 accusations against bishops, clerics and lay workers in the Church, from among 144 reports of sexual abuse implicating 158 Church workers made since 2000.

Egypt is of strategic importance to the United States because of its control of the Suez Canal, its border and peace treaty with Israel and its status as the most populous Arab nation. It has been without a U.S. ambassador for over a year.
U.S. President Donald Trump has signaled warmer relations with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi by unfreezing $195 million in military aid previously withheld because of concerns over Egypt’s human rights record.
Sisi led the 2013 overthrow of Egypt's first freely-elected president, Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood, following protests against Mursi’s rule. He was elected president in 2014 and re-elected this year after an election in which all serious opponents had withdrawn.
Egyptian authorities have jailed thousands of Sisi opponents and critics in recent years, including both alleged Islamist militants and secular rights activists. Cairo says it is going after terrorists and saboteurs trying to undermine the state.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Satterfield's post as the top U.S. diplomat for the Middle East will end if the U.S. Senate confirms David Schenker as assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs. Satterfield has that job on an acting basis for nearly a year.
The White House, which nominates U.S. ambassadors, declined comment on Satterfield emerging as the leading candidate to head the U.S. embassy in Cairo, as did the State Department. 
A former U.S. official said Satterfield had particularly good contacts with the Egyptian military because of his 2009 to 2017 service heading the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO) in the Sinai Peninsula, which oversees security provisions of the 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty.
Despite U.S. concerns over human rights in Egypt, militaries from the two countries have deep ties and next month will take part in Exercise Bright Star, which is designed to improve their ability to operate together, the U.S. military said.

Satterfield has previously served as the deputy U.S. chief of mission in Iraq, ambassador to Lebanon, director for Near Eastern affairs on the National Security Council as well as in Syria, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia.

(Reuters) - Nearly 80,000 students in Washington state were unable to attend the first day of school this week as thousands of teachers went on strike seeking higher salaries, teacher's unions said.
Educators in seven school districts in southwestern Washington were on strike as early as mid-August and the number of walkouts was expected to rise, according to the Washington Education Association, which represents teachers in the state.
Teachers seeking enhanced education funding also have walked out in recent months in West Virginia, Arizona and Oklahoma.
More Washington educators would walk out next week. Teachers in Seattle - the state's most-populated city - on Tuesday gave their union authority to call for a strike unless a contract deal is reached before classes resume there on Sept. 5, according to the Seattle Education Association. 
Seattle Public Schools officials said the district backs educators and believes it has provided them with fair and competitive salaries, but it said on Wednesday that it must also manage its budget to provide services for students.
""We must balance our desire to support our educators while at the same time sustaining critical services and programs students need and families expect,"" Seattle school officials said in a statement. ""Even with offering every state dollar, starting in 2019-20 the district is projecting a budget shortfall that will grow over time.""
Contract renegotiation began in most of Washington's 295 school districts, which serve more than 1 million students, after state lawmakers this year approved an additional $1 billion hike for educators' salaries for the upcoming school year, according to the Seattle Times. 
The Vancouver Education Association union said its proposal for salary increases only includes the money specifically allocated by the state for salaries and that it would not negatively impact students.

""School districts across the state have already settled fair contracts,"" the Vancouver union said on its website. ""We are currently in the midst of a statewide educator shortage crisis. We cannot afford to have our highly qualified teachers leave for other, more competitive districts.""

400,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>",Conservative media move to front line of battle to undermine Pope Francis,"By Philip Pullella
VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Last March, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano dined on the outskirts of Rome at the home of a conservative Italian Catholic journalist. Over pasta, fish and white wine, the prelate poured out his concern for the future of the Roman Catholic Church.
It was the start of about five months of contacts and collaboration between Vigano and several conservative journalists and media outlets that would lead to one of the greatest crises for the Church in modern times.
In a bombshell statement published last weekend when Pope Francis was in Ireland, Vigano, the former Vatican ambassador to Washington, urged Francis to resign on the grounds he knew for years about the sexual misconduct of an American cardinal and did nothing.
The full extent of journalists' involvement in the statement - from conception and editing to translation and publication - emerges from a series of Reuters interviews that reveal a union of conservative clergy and media aimed at what papal defenders say is a campaign to weaken the reformist Francis's pontificate.
Since his election in 2013, conservatives have sharply criticized Francis, saying he has left many faithful confused by pronouncements that the Church should be more welcoming to homosexuals and divorced Catholics and not be obsessed by ""culture war"" issues such as abortion.
""The conservatives have declared war and they are convinced they can reform the Church with a frontal attack,"" a senior Vatican prelate said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because ""the line is silence"" now.
Vigano said he had told the pope of the allegations five years ago, soon after Francis' election. The statement included no supporting documents and also accused a long list of current and past Vatican and U.S. Church officials of facilitating the expansion of a ""homosexual network"" in the Church.
Pope Francis told reporters on his plane returning from Ireland that he would ""not say one word"" about the accusations. ""Read the document carefully and judge it for yourselves. It speaks for itself,"" he said.
Vatican sources say it still has not been decided if the Vatican will issue a detailed institutional response to Vigano's accusations, which they say have caused consternation among many members of the faithful.
UNPRECEDENTED ATTACK ON POPE
Vigano's move, an unprecedented attack on the pope by a Vatican insider, was the latest blow to the credibility of the Church.
Two weeks ago, a grand jury in Pennsylvania released the findings of the largest-ever investigation of sex abuse in the U.S. Catholic Church, finding that 301 priests in the state had sexually abused minors over the past 70 years.
The dinner with Vigano in March was held at the home of Aldo Maria Valli, a journalist who covers the Vatican for Italian state television RAI, publishes a conservative blog and has written several books.
Valli writes in his blog that he had several other meetings with Vigano, including a second dinner in Valli's home in August to discuss the topics of the statement.
He says Vigano arrived at their last meeting in a secret location wearing sunglasses and a baseball cap - unusual headgear for an archbishop.
On Aug. 22, Vigano went to the home of Marco Tosatti, a longtime Vatican journalist who writes for conservative publications and runs his own blog that is highly critical of Francis' papacy.
Tosatti said he helped Vigano rewrite and edit the statement during a three-hour meeting. Valli told Reuters Tosatti then sent him and other selected journalists the final version.
Valli told Reuters there is clear division between his work as a television journalist and his personal opinions in his blog and books.
PUSHING THE BUTTON
The statement surfaced on Aug. 26, four days after it was dated. Interviews with those involved show its publication was coordinated in consultation with Valli, Tosatti, the National Catholic Register in the United States and Italy's La Verita, both conservative newspapers that criticize Francis regularly.
It was translated into English by Diane Montagna of the conservative LifeSiteNews, which published it at the same time and often carries full texts of speeches by Cardinal Raymond Burke, one of the pope's fiercest critics. 
""It's very reminiscent of what is going on in conservative politics in the United States. It's the same playbook,"" said David Gibson, director of the Center on Religion and Culture at Fordham University in New York. He was alluding to the close relationship between President Donald Trump's administration and conservative-leaning news outlets such as Fox News. 
Tosatti told Reuters there was ""no conservative conspiracy"" behind the statement and that its publication was delayed because it had to be translated in several languages.
He said it was ""a mere coincidence"" that it was published during the pope's trip to Ireland, where sexual abuse by the clergy was a main issue.
But Valli says in his blog that its release was specifically timed so that it would come up during the pope's in-flight news conference from Dublin to Rome. Experienced Vatican journalists such as Valli and Tosatti understand that the papal plane is a rare chance for reporters to ask the pope questions.
Another journalist who received the statement also confirmed that Vigano, who is now in hiding in an undisclosed location and issues statements through Valli, wanted it published while the pope was in Ireland.
""Obviously Vigano is being used as a weapon by a whole coterie of people who can't stand Pope Francis and the changes he wants to make to the Church,"" said Alexander Stille, professor of international journalism at Columbia University in New York and author of several books on Italy. 

""People who would defend to the death the doctrine of papal infallibility have no difficulty in treating a pope who has been elected by all the standard Vatican protocols as if we were a corporate manager who could be fired from one day to the next.""

Several members left the institution's board in April over the handling of allegations of sexual misconduct by a man married to another member. The academy postponed awarding this year's prize.
However, Svenska Dagbladet said Sara Danius, Kjell Espmark and Peter Englund were coming back to the Academy, which is due to meet next in September. No one was available for comment at the Academy while the three did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. 
At the heart of the row are allegations of sexual assault and harassment made by several women against Jean-Claude Arnault, a photographer and well-known cultural figure in Sweden who is married to poet and Academy member Katarina Frostenson.
Arnault has repeatedly denied all the allegations against him, including of being the source of leaks of the names of some past winners before the formal announcements.
""We are ready to help,"" Espmark told Svenska Dagbladet. ""We have talked amongst the three of us. A big responsibility for the Academy falls upon us.""

The returning members raise the headcount at the Academy, which was originally 18, to 13. It needs at least 12 to elect new members.

The couple, John and Susan Cooper, died within hours of each other in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Hurghada on Aug. 21.
John Cooper, 69, died at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel and Susan Cooper, 63, died at a nearby hospital, prompting an evacuation of Thomas Cook (TGC.L) customers.
No one was immediately available to comment from the hotel, which said last week there had not been a rise in cases of illness. Egypt's public prosecutor said on Saturday that engineers had checked the hotel's air conditioning system and found it to be sound.
Local officials initially said both had died from heart failure, but Egypt's public prosecutor said the cause of death was not immediately clear.
""Autopsies on the two bodies are currently being conducted by a team of forensic pathologists ... I anticipate this will be concluded during next week,"" Tourism Minister Rania al-Mashat said in a statement.
A team led by Egypt's public prosecutor was examining the hygiene at the hotel, testing food, water and air conditioning systems, Mashat said.
Thomas Cook CEO Peter Fankhauser traveled to Cairo to meet Mashat and Egyptian Prime Minister Mustafa Madbouly on Wednesday ""to get to the bottom of what went wrong"", a statement from the company said.
Egypt relies heavily on tourism revenues, which have increased this year after the industry was hit hard by the turmoil that followed a 2011 popular uprising.
Tourism revenue jumped 77 percent in the first half of 2018 to around $4.8 billion compared with the same period last year, an official told Reuters on Wednesday.

No injuries were reported. 
The church was closed to the public at the time and is normally open only for marriage ceremonies, but dogs were brought in to sniff through the rubble to make certain no one had been buried, the fire department said.
The roof collapsed onto the floor of St. Joseph the Carpenter, which was built in the 1500s on top of the ancient Mamertine prison, where the defeated Gallic king Vercingetorix and Saints Peter and Paul are said to have been held.
Wooden beams and terracotta tiles were scattered in piles across the floor of the church, and one beam crashed through the floor and vaulted ceiling of a chapel below, fire official Luigi Liolli said shortly after inspecting the damage. 
Italy has sought to attract private investors to renovate its historical sites, including the Colosseum, as budget austerity has cut into spending needed to maintain the country's rich historical and artistic heritage.

In recent years several walls have collapsed in the ancient city of Pompeii, which was buried in volcanic ash almost 2,000 years ago. Pompeii, which has been partially excavated by archaeologists, is one of Italy's most popular tourist attractions.

Labour has been battling accusations of anti-Semitism for months, and leader Jeremy Corbyn has previously apologized for what he has described as ""pockets"" of anti-Semitism in his party.
Frank Field, 76, who has represented Birkenhead in northwest England since 1979, said on Thursday he would now sit as an independent Labour member of parliament due to anti-semitism and ""intolerance, nastiness and intimidation"" within the party. 
""Britain fought the Second World War to banish these views from our politics, but that superhuman effort and success is now under huge and sustained internal attack,"" he wrote in a letter to the party's chief whip, a lawmaker responsible for making sure members of parliament vote in line with the party's position.
""The leadership is doing nothing substantive to address this erosion of our core values. It saddens me to say that we are increasingly seen as a racist party.""
Since unexpectedly becoming Labour leader in 2015 after decades spent on the left-wing fringes of the party, Corbyn has repeatedly faced accusations of turning a blind eye to anti-Semitic comments in the party and among groups he supports.
Earlier this week, Britain's former chief rabbi called Corbyn an anti-Semite and said comments about Zionists he made five years ago were the most offensive by a senior UK politician in half a century.

BOA VISTA, Brazil (Reuters) - Many Venezuelans thought they were leaving a collapsing economy for a land of milk and honey just next door.
But most of those fleeing the turmoil in Venezuela by walking into Brazil at an Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) border crossing have found themselves surviving on the streets and sleeping in tents, hammocks or on pieces of cardboard.
Their drama is part of a deepening regional humanitarian crisis set off by the exodus of tens of thousands of Venezuelans who are voting with their feet and abandoning their country, mainly into neighboring Colombia, and also Ecuador and Peru.
The city of Boa Vista, capital of the Brazilian border state of Roraima, has received 35,000 Venezuelan immigrants in the past two years, swelling its population by more than 10 percent. Today, some 3,000 are homeless, according to the mayor's office. 
Near the city bus terminal, Venezuelans sleep on grassy highway medians and in shopping areas. Some are lucky enough to spend the night in tents handed out by refugee agencies.
Others hang hammocks outside car body shops and auto-parts distributors whose Brazilian owners allow them to spend the night under a covered area, as long as they are gone in the morning. 
This generosity by local shop owners contrasts with an outbreak of xenophobic attacks on Aug. 18 against Venezuelan immigrants at the border town of Pacaraima, ignited after a Brazilian was allegedly robbed and stabbed by Venezuelans in his home.
""Some Brazilians treat us badly, but not all of them,"" said Anyi Gomez, a pregnant 19-year-old who came to Brazil with her mother and survives by using a squeegee to clean car windshields for change at traffic lights.
The prenatal care she is getting at a public hospital in Brazil made it worth leaving Venezuela where her baby could have died for lack of food and medicine, she said.
On Tuesday, Brazilian President Michel Temer said the Armed Forces were being sent to Roraima for at least two weeks to help keep order and ensure the safety of immigrants. Temer blamed Venezuela's authoritarian government for causing a regional crisis that requires a collective response.
Local churches provide meals or hand out bread and juice to the homeless Venezuelans.

""We have food, but no roof. And there is no work,"" said Luis Daniel, from Caracas. ""I came to get a job to take back things for my children who are going hungry in Venezuela. But all I have now is exhaustion from sleeping outdoors.""

HANOI (Reuters) - Police in Vietnam have arrested a man accused of being a member of a ""terrorist"" group and planning attacks in the country, the Ministry of Public Security said on Thursday.
In a statement, it said Le Quoc Binh, 44, was taken into custody early on Wednesday after entering Vietnam from Cambodia bringing a large number of weapons which he intended to carry out terrorist activities.
It said Binh was a member of Viet Tan, a U.S.-based exiles group that Communist Vietnam regards as a ""terrorist"" body.
Police seized seven guns and 500 bullets after raiding Binh's house in the central city of Quy Nhon, it added.
Binh's family members and lawyer were not immediately available for comment. 
A spokesman for Viet Tan, which describes itself as an ""unsanctioned pro-democracy party"", rejected the allegations. 
""Hanoi's Ministry of Public Security is trying to scare people (not to) support pro-democracy organizations by falsely accusing us of smuggling weapons. This is a ridiculous fabrication,"" Viet Tan spokesman Duy Hoang said in a statement. 
""Viet Tan does not espouse armed violence nor work with any individuals that do,"" Hoang said.
Binh's arrest came days after Vietnam ordered police and military forces in the capital Hanoi to prevent big gatherings or protests during its National Day holiday on Sept. 2. [L3N1VI331]
Last week, a court in the southern commercial hub of Ho Chi Minh City jailed two Vietnamese-Americans accused of loyalty to the now defunct U.S.-backed state of South Vietnam and masterminding a series of bomb plots. 
Police said the pair had planned more bomb attacks on public holidays. Vietnamese authorities said the two were acting on behalf of the ""Provisional Government of Vietnam"", a California-based exiles organization also listed as a ""terrorist"" group by Vietnam.
South Vietnam ceased to exist when the Communist North won the Vietnam War in 1975.

(Reuters) - A U.S. Army sergeant stationed in Hawaii will serve 25 years in prison after admitting he attempted to provide material support to the Islamic State militant group, federal prosecutors said.
Ikaika Erik Kang, 35, was working as a military air traffic controller based at Schofield Barracks in Oahu when he was arrested last year after an investigation that involved undercover agents and sources who posed as Islamic State operatives and sympathizers, the FBI has said. [nL1N1KD09T]
Kang, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to four counts of attempting to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization, the U.S. Justice Department said. Under a plea deal with federal prosecutors, he agreed to serve 25 years in prison and then at least 20 years of supervised release.
""Kang swore to defend the United States as a member of our military but betrayed his country by swearing allegiance to ISIS and attempting to provide material support to the foreign terrorist organization,"" John Demers, assistant attorney general for national security, said in a statement.
According to court documents, Kang became sympathetic to Islamic State by at least early 2016 and regularly watched the group's online propaganda, including execution videos.
He also made numerous statements supporting Islamic State, talked about wanting to join the group and spoke approvingly about committing acts of violence, prosecutors said.
In mid-2017 he met several times with undercover FBI agents who he believed had Islamic State connections, giving them secret military documents, a commercially purchased small aerial drone, and various items of military-style clothing and gear.
On July 8, 2017, Kang swore an oath of allegiance to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and told undercover FBI operatives he wanted to get his assault-style rifle, go to downtown Honolulu and the Waikiki strip and start shooting, court records showed. He was arrested later that same day.
Kang's attorney, Birney Bervar, could not immediately be reached for comment on Thursday.
Last year, Bervar said Kang suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder that the Army failed to address after he returned from Iraq in 2011 and Afghanistan in 2014. Bervar accused the FBI of exploiting his client's mental issues. 
Kang is due to sentenced formally on Dec. 10.

YANGON (Reuters) - The verdict in Myanmar's prosecution of two Reuters reporters accused of breaching the Official Secrets Act was postponed on Monday until Sept. 3 because the judge overseeing the case is sick, a court official said.
Scores of reporters and diplomats had gathered at the Yangon court to hear the verdict on journalists Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, the culmination of eight months of hearings in a landmark case that has come to be seen as a test of progress towards democracy in the Southeast Asian country.
""We are disappointed not to have received the judge's decision today,"" Reuters said in a statement. 
""Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo have already spent more than eight months in prison based on allegations of a crime they did not commit. We look forward to receiving the verdict next week, when we very much hope that they will be acquitted and reunited with their families.""
Government spokesman Zaw Htay could not be immediately reached for comment on the postponement of the verdict.
The climax of the case comes amid building pressure on the administration of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi over a security crackdown in the western state of Rakhine that was sparked by militant attacks in August 2017.
Later on Monday a U.N mandated fact-finding mission will release a report on the crackdown, which triggered the exodus of more than 700,000 stateless Muslim Rohingya, according to U.N. agencies. Most are now living in refugee camps in neighboring Bangladesh.
On Tuesday, the United Nations Security Council will hold a briefing on Myanmar in New York.
Monday's court proceedings lasted just a few minutes, long enough for a judge standing in for Judge Ye Lwin, who has overseen the case against the Reuters journalists, to announce that a ruling would be made next week.
""The judge is in poor health, so I am here to announce that the verdict is postponed to the third,"" said Judge Khin Maung Maung.
Defense lawyer Khin Maung Zaw told reporters that the stand-in judge had said the verdict was ready but it had to be pronounced by the judge assigned to the case.
Wa Lone smiled broadly and made a thumbs-up sign with his hands in cuffs as he walked into the court, with Kyaw Soe Oo just behind him. 
""We are not afraid or shaken. The truth is on our side. Whatever the situation is, we will not be shaken. They cannot make us weak,"" Wa Lone told reporters after the brief hearing.
Several journalists who came to cover the verdict wore T-shirts that read ""Free Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo"" and ""Journalism is not a crime.""
""LITMUS TEST""
The Reuters reporters are accused of breaching the colonial-era Official Secrets Act, which carries a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison, by collecting documents relating to the country's security forces.
They told the court during their trial that two police officials handed them papers at a north Yangon restaurant moments before other officers arrested them last December. 
One police witness testified the restaurant meeting was a set-up to entrap the journalists to block or punish them for their reporting of a mass killing of Rohingya and other abuses involving soldiers and police in Inn Din, a village in Rakhine.
The United Nations has called the military's campaign in northern Rakhine a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"". 
Myanmar has denied allegations of killings, rapes and arson made by refugees against its security forces, saying it conducted a legitimate counterinsurgency operation against Muslim militants.
But the military acknowledged the killing of the 10 Rohingya men and boys at Inn Din after arresting the Reuters reporters. In April the military said seven soldiers had been sentenced to 10 years in prison with hard labor for their part in the killings.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan said on Thursday it would lead a campaign to raise funds for the U.N. agency that supports Palestinian refugees, to help it survive after the United States cut its funding.
Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said a meeting next month in New York on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly would mobilize support for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) to continue core education and health services.
""Any shortage in funding will drive hundreds of thousands towards deprivation and despair,"" Safadi, whose country has 2.2 million U.N. registered Palestinian refugees, said in Amman after meeting Pierre Krahenbuhl, the UNRWA head. Jordan will call for an Arab League meeting to lobby for donors to cover the $200 million shortfall needed to shore up UNRWA, Safadi said.
UNRWA has faced a cash crisis since the United States, long its biggest donor, earlier this year slashed funding, saying the agency needed to make unspecified reforms and calling on the Palestinians to renew peace talks with Israel.
The agency was founded in 1949 after the first Arab-Israel war, in the wake of the exodus of around 700,000 refugees who fled or were driven out of Israel on its founding as a state.
UNRWA now looks after more than 5 million descendants of those original refugees, in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
""One cannot wish 5.3 million Palestine refugees away. These are people who have rights and for many years now, for decades have faced a plight and injustice that is simply immense,"" UNRWA's Krahenbuhl said at a news conference with Safadi. 
""As long as a just a lasting solution has not found of the issue of Israel-Palestine conflict we will continue to implement the mandate that the General Assembly has given us.""
The Palestinians assert the right under international law to return to homes abandoned in Israel or be compensated. Safadi said funding cuts for UNRWA undermine that right.
""The continuation of UNRWA means continued commitment by the international community to working towards a just solution of the refugees that guarantees the right of return and compensation,"" Safadi said.

Safadi last week raised the plight of UNRWA with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington where officials say he warned of ""dangerous consequences"" to regional stability if the financial crisis were not resolved.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia will begin a major naval exercise in the Mediterranean on Saturday, the Ministry of Defense announced, a move the Kremlin said was justified by a failure to deal with militants in Syria's Idlib province.
Idlib and areas surrounding it are the last major enclave held by rebels opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, a close Russian ally, and a source has told Reuters he is preparing a phased offensive to regain it. 
""This hotbed of terrorists (in Idlib) does really not bode anything good if such inaction continues,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call.
""The situation in Syria has a significant potential to become more complicated and the situation around Idlib leaves a lot to be desired,"" he said after the announcement of the naval drills, which appeared aimed at deterring the West from carrying out strikes on Syrian government forces.
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem met his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Moscow on Thursday, saying ""we will go all the way"" in Idlib and declaring the Nusra Front group, formerly the local branch of al Qaeda, as the main target.
The Russian defense ministry said more than 25 warships and support vessels and around 30 planes, including fighter jets and strategic bombers, would take part in the Mediterranean drills which it said would last from Sept. 1 to Sept. 8.
They would involve anti-aircraft, anti-submarine and anti-mining exercises. Ships from Russia's Northern, Baltic and Black Sea Fleets would take part as would vessels from its Caspian Flotilla.
The 'Marshal Ustinov' missile cruiser would lead the drills.
""In the interests of ensuring the safety of shipping and air traffic and in line with international law, the areas of the exercise will be declared dangerous for shipping and flights,"" the ministry said.
This followed the announcement on Tuesday of Russia's biggest war games next month since the fall of the Soviet Union in the country's central and eastern military districts. 
Russia has been expanding its naval forces in the Mediterranean this month, part of what a newspaper has called Moscow's largest naval build-up since it entered the Syrian conflict in 2015. 
FOREIGN FIGHTERS 
Anatoly Antonov, Russia's ambassador to the United States, warned Washington on Thursday against what he called ""groundless and illegal aggression against Syria"". Antonov said he had told U.S. officials Moscow was concerned by signs that the United States was preparing new strikes on Syria.
The United Nations has called on Russia, Iran and Turkey to delay a battle that could affect millions of civilians.

U.N.

U.N. Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said there was a high concentration of foreign fighters in Idlib, including an estimated 10,000 fighters designated by the U.N. as terrorists, who he said belonged to the al-Nusra Front and al Qaeda.
There could be no justification to use heavy weapons against them in densely populated areas, he said. Miscalculations could lead to unintended consequences, including the possible use of chemical weapons.
""Avoiding the potential use of chemical weapons is indeed crucial,"" de Mistura told reporters in Geneva. 
""We all are aware that both the government and al-Nusra have the capability to produce weaponized chlorine."" 
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, speaking during a meeting with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Moscow on Thursday, said: ""We are at the final stage of solving the crisis in Syria and liberating our whole territory from terrorism."" 
""I assure you that we do not have chemical weapons and are not able to use them,"" he added, according to Syrian state news agency SANA.
Idlib province is the last major rebel-held area in Syria, serving as what the U.N. has called a ""dumping ground"" for fighters and civilians evacuated from other battles. It is one of the areas that Russia, Iran and Turkey agreed to ""de-escalate"" last year at a series of talks in the Kazakh capital Astana.
But a source said on Wednesday that Russia's ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, was preparing a phased offensive there.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday that militants in Idlib had to be liquidated, describing them as ""a festering abscess"".
""Why such a hurry, and not provide more time in order to allow more discussions, especially among the Astana guarantors?,"" de Mistura said, referring to Russia, Iran and Turkey.
The potential battlefield contains two crucial roads, transport arteries between major Syrian cities, which the Syrian government argues must be made safe. De Mistura asked if it was necessary to create a ""worst-case scenario"" just to secure Syrian government access to the roads. 
It would be better to set up humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians than rush into a battle which could prove to be a ""perfect storm"", he said.

""The lives of 2.9 million people are at stake, and international mutually threatening messages and warnings and counter-warnings are taking place in the last few days.""

The three reporters, working for the TsUR online news outlet, traveled to CAR to investigate the activities of clandestine Russian private military contractors known as the Wagner Group when they were ambushed and killed on July 30. 
Khodorkovsky, who has vowed to find those responsible, said the choice of local assistant for the reporters had been a ""significant mistake"" and that responsibility for that lay in part with TsUR's producers. 
Khodorkovsky said he had received a letter of resignation from Andrei Konyakhin, TsUR's chief editor.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Britain is committed to free trade with Kenya after it leaves the European Union, British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Thursday on a visit to Nairobi as her government plays up increased trade with non-EU nations as a Brexit selling point.
May was speaking on the third stop of a trip to Africa during which she has said she wants Britain to become the biggest investor on the continent out of the world's richest nations. [L8N1VJ180] 
""As Britain prepares to leave the European Union we are committed to a smooth transition that ensures continuity in our trading relationship with Kenya, ensuring Kenya retains its duty free quota free access to the UK market,"" May said. 
The EU is currently Britain's biggest trading partner. Skeptics say closer ties and more trade with Africa will do little to offset the economic impact of Brexit. 
Total trade with Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya, the three nations on her tour this week, amounted to just over 13 billion pounds in 2016, official British figures show, compared with 554 billion pounds of trade with the EU that year.
The prime minister has used her first official visit to the region of more than one billion people to stress that Britain's relationship with former colonies, including Kenya and other African nations, is increasingly focused on private investment, not on aid.
In Nigeria, Africa's biggest economy and most populous nation, May also promised closer commercial ties and promoted the longstanding presence of British companies in the country.
Analysts have said that as Britain confronts the full impact of Brexit, African states will enter discussions from a position of strength, given the many other options they have for trade and military partners, from Russia and China to the Gulf and Turkey.
So far Britain's record in using aid money on private investment in Africa is mixed. The government's private equity arm, the CDC group, invested $140 million in ARM Cement, a Kenyan firm, two years ago that was put in administration this month. 
Britain is Kenya's largest trading partner and a major market for its exports of cut flowers. The rapidly expanding agriculture sector is Kenya's biggest foreign exchange earner and a big source of jobs. 
Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, speaking alongside May at a news conference, said he welcomed her assurance that Kenyan duty free exports would continue after Brexit and said Kenya will be pressing for an increase in exports.
British companies are also promoting trade opportunities outside the EU after Brexit. 
""The EU is an important market, it's established and mature, but our great markets in the future will be in Asia, Africa, and South America,"" said Karen Betts, chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, who is traveling with May. She said the EU makes up 30 percent of Scotch whisky exports.
FIGHTING CORRUPTION, TERRORISM 
Kenyatta said two agreements signed on Thursday -- one to enhance military cooperation, the other for Britain to return assets and proceeds of corruption to Kenya -- indicated the close ties between the two countries.
Kenyan troops are part of a 22,000-strong African Union peacekeeping force fighting in neighboring Somalia against al-Shabaab Islamist militants. AU troops landed in Mogadishu more than a decade ago and Somali forces are supposed to eventually take over their duties.
May said she was glad to hear Kenyatta call for a transition from peacekeepers to stronger Somali security forces.
Kenyatta, who was re-elected for a second term after a bloody and prolonged elections season, said his government's fight against graft is important for national unity and his legacy.
Corruption drains billions of dollars from the state every year in Kenya, and foreign businessmen complain it is hard to get things done without paying bribes. 
May also announced Britain will set up a cyber center in Nairobi to help authorities fight online child sex abuse by tracking the sharing of abusive images on the internet.
""Already, British terrorists and child abusers are in UK jails because of our cooperation,"" she said. 

Margaret Thatcher was the last British prime minister to visit Kenya, in 1988.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Bidding to stem the rise of the far-right AfD, Germany's left next week launches a grassroots movement aimed at emulating the success of Britain's Momentum group which propelled hardliner Jeremy Corbyn to the leadership of the Labour Party.
Commentators are skeptical about its prospects, dismissing it as a vanity project for Germany's best-known and most divisive leftists - former finance minister Oskar Lafontaine and his wife Sahra Wagenknecht of the hardline Left party. 
However, even before its Sept. 4 launch, the movement has won some 50,000 online backers.
Aiming to cut across party lines and harness support from the Social Democrats (SPD), environmentalist Greens and radical Left party, Aufstehen (""Stand Up"") describes itself as a force for social and democratic renewal.
""In the last decade, left-liberal parties have failed to forge a reliable alliance and develop a political concept to take power. They even lost protest voters to the AfD,"" it says.
In last year's election, the combined support of the three left parties was just 38 percent.
Like its British and French counterparts, Germany's SPD has been deserted by traditional voters after shifting to the center in the last two decades, first with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and then by sharing power with Angela Merkel's conservatives. 
Policy details are still unclear, but the Aufstehen website talks about secure jobs, higher wages, fair taxes, environmental protection, disarmament and combating xenophobia. 
Analysts see limited comparisons between Aufstehen's prospects and the success of Labour's Momentum movement which helped the Labour party nearly triple its membership to 600,000 within two years.
""In Germany, anyone who is in the left camp can choose between the SPD, Greens or Left. In England it is more concentrated - you have to vote Labour or stay at home,"" said Gero Neugebauer, a political expert at Berlin's Free University.
Some commentators see more similarities with Jean-Luc Melenchon's left wing populist movement in France. He won just under 20 percent of the vote in the first round of France's 2017 presidential election.
Others point to Bernie Sanders, whose campaign in the United States complicated Hillary Clinton's bid to be Democratic presidential candidate for the 2016 election. 
SCEPTICISM
Neugebauer doesn't set much store by the initial flurry of online support. ""If you go through a shop door and take a look, you can still leave without buying anything,"" he said.
Political scientist Ulrich von Alemann was cited in Cicero magazine as seeing Aufstehen's potential vote share at 10-15 percent.
It is unclear whether it would even stand in an election but pollsters are dubious it could win back votes from the AfD, polling at around 15 percent after capitalizing on Merkel's open-door migrant policy, but lacking a broad policy platform.
""I don't see Aufstehen attracting AfD voters. They are people who have latent far-right tendencies,"" said Forsa pollster Manfred Guellner, adding most would rather stay at home than vote for another protest party.
However, in addition to support from high-profile figures including former SPD Chancellor Willy Brandt's son, the website has video clips from teachers, pensioners, mechanics and DJs. 
""We need an initiative for the future, a vision for our country,"" an internet economist named as Karl-Heinz tells the website, adding in a fast-changing world, people are scared.
One of the movement's biggest obstacles is its founders. 
While its leaders have not been announced, Aufstehen is the brainchild of Lafontaine and Wagenknecht. Loved by some hardliners, they have little broader appeal and are very much part of the political establishment they are criticizing. 
Lafontaine is a figure of hate in the SPD after quitting as Schroeder's finance minister over welfare reforms and moving to the Left party, comprising some former East German Communists.

""The basic idea of Aufstehen isn't bad, to help the left out of its problems, but if Lafontaine is behind it, I am highly skeptical about its success,"" said Guellner.

GENEVA (Reuters) - United Nations human rights experts voiced concern on Thursday over alleged Chinese political ""re-education camps"" for Muslim Uighurs, and called for the immediate release of those detained on the ""pretext of countering terrorism"".
The U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination cited estimates that ""from tens of thousands to upwards of a million Uighurs"" may be detained in the far western Xinjiang province.
Its findings were issued after a two-day review of China's record, the first since 2009, earlier this month.
China's foreign ministry rejected the allegations at the time, and said that anti-China forces were behind criticism of policies in Xinjiang.
China has said that Xinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists who plot attacks and stir up tensions between the mostly Muslim Uighur minority and the ethnic Han Chinese majority.
The independent experts said during the review that the panel had received many credible reports that a million ethnic Uighurs are held in what resembles a ""massive internment camp that is shrouded in secrecy"". Panel expert Gay McDougall described it at the time as a ""no-rights zone"".
In its conclusions, the panel said it was alarmed by: ""Numerous reports of detention of large numbers of ethnic Uighurs and other Muslim minorities held incommunicado and often for long periods, without being charged or tried, under the pretext of countering terrorism and religious extremism.""
It regretted that there was no official data on those detained ""for even non-threatening expressions of Muslim ethno-religious culture like daily greetings"".
The panel decried ""reports of mass surveillance disproportionately targeting ethnic Uighurs, including through frequent baseless police stops and the scanning of mobile phones at police checkpoint stations"".
There were reports that ""many Uighurs abroad who left China have allegedly been returned to the country against their will"", it said, calling on China to disclose the current location and status of students and asylum seekers who went back.
The panel also urged China to allow Tibetans access to passports for foreign travel and to promote the use of the Tibetan language in education, the judicial system, and media.

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - A former Congo military leader on trial for charges ranging from murder and rape to conscripting child soldiers and sexual slavery told judges at the International Criminal Court (ICC) on Thursday that he was ""a revolutionary, but not a criminal”.
Bosco Ntaganda, who was dubbed ""The Terminator"" during his period with the Union of Congolese Patriots (UPC) militia, insisted that ""the Terminator described by the prosecutor is not me"" as he delivered a closing statement at the end of his three-year trial.
Ntaganda faces 18 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for acts allegedly committed in 2002-2003 when he was deputy Chief of Staff of the UPC, a militia group in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
Ntaganda surrendered at the U.S. Embassy in neighboring Rwanda in 2013, seven years after his indictment, asking to be turned over to the ICC after apparently having fled Congo due to infighting among military groups.
Prosecutors argued earlier that Ntaganda not only personally committed crimes ranging from murder to rape, sexual enslavement and the use of child soldiers but also ordered and oversaw his troops committing similar atrocities. 
They added that Ntaganda’s UPC, dominated by the Hema clan, allegedly targeted the rival Lendu for expulsion from Congo’s mineral-rich Ituri region. 
But his defense has insisted Ntaganda was a loyal and disciplined military commander whose involvement in events “caused fewer victims instead of more”. The UPC commander took measures to prevent crimes and punish perpetrators, defense lawyer Stephane Bourgon said.
Bourgon urged the court to asses Ntaganda's deeds “based on the evidence, not on the internet” and cast doubt on the reliability of several prosecution witnesses.
Bourgon recalled the recent acquittal on appeal of another Congolese militia leader, Jean-Pierre Bemba. 
In that case judges ruled that while atrocities were committed by Bemba's troops his level of control over his troops was uncertain and he had taken sufficient measures to try and stop them.
No date has been set yet for a verdict in Ntaganda's trial, with judges saying Thursday “it would certainly take some time” to go over all the case material.

Speaking to Denmark's Queen Margrethe during an audience in Copenhagen on Wednesday, Macron praised the Danes as a ""Lutheran people"" open to new ideas, while he described the French as ""Gauls who are resistant to change"".
The lightly delivered aside prompted a flood of criticism from domestic opponents.
""It is unacceptable to hear the president criticize and caricature the French like this,"" said Laurent Wauquiez, head of the center-right Les Republicains party.
Marine Le Pen of the far-right said the comment showed Macron held the French in contempt and far-left deputy Alexis Corbiere called it ""utter nonsense"".
Macron, who has made reform a watchword of his presidency, defended himself, saying the comment was meant humorously and people shouldn't get swallowed up by social media outrage.
""I don't have the feeling it's a scoop that France was originally made up of Gallic tribes, which for me is something to be very proud of,"" he told a news conference in Helsinki, the final leg of a three-day visit to the Nordic region.
""I love France and the French and I love these Gallic tribes with all their variety and paradoxes... It's not contempt to say things as they are and to tell the truth.""
Macron has faced frequent criticism for his sharp tongue and sometimes cutting wit.
Shortly after being elected in May last year, he berated a group of striking workers for ""kicking up a bloody mess"" and was roundly criticized for referring to ""slackers"".
He also upbraided a teenager for not addressing him politely and caused a diplomatic spat with the Italian government after accusing its leaders of cynicism.
Macron has introduced a raft of reforms, some of which have led to strikes and protests but without anything like the level of union resistance seen in previous eras.

""If I thought we were nothing but reactionaries, I wouldn't be here before you,"" he told reporters in Helsinki.

The migrants had been abandoned after their guards fled fighting pitting rival groups vying for power and state funds, a recurring theme in the North African country since the chaotic overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in a 2011 NATO-backed uprising. 
Hundreds of migrants have been brought to a ""safer place"" from two centers run by the U.N.-backed government from the Ain Zara area in southeastern Tripoli, aid workers said.
The U.N refugee agency UNHCR ""in coordination with other agencies and the Department for Combatting Illegal Migration (DCIM) facilitated the transport of all persons in Ain Zara,"" it said in a statement.
The migrants were mainly Eritrean, Ethiopian and Somali nationals who were brought to a separate detention center away from fighting.
However, a few people were still awaiting their evacuation at Ain Zara, an official at a separate international organization said.
Libya is the main departure point in North Africa for migrants crossing the Mediterranean Sea to Europe, mainly from other parts of Africa.

The number of crossings has sharply fallen off since Italy provided the coast guard with more boats and brokered deals with local groups in a smuggler hub last year.

China has spent $1.3 billion on concessionary loans and gifts since 2011 to become the Pacific's second-largest donor after Australia, stoking concern in the West that several tiny nations could end up overburdened and in debt to China.
Samoan Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, speaking during a visit to the Lowy Institute, a foreign policy think-tank in Sydney, said China was not to blame.
""We should not accuse the lender itself,"" Malielegaoi told Reuters in an interview when asked about the region's growing debt to China.
""It's up to the country itself to ensure that it sets down guidelines to borrow,"" he said. ""The only reason why countries have not been able to pay is because they did not have proper financial strategies.""
China has said it is supporting development in a region where it is needed.
But the debt issue has become a prominent concern since China took possession of a Sri Lankan port as Colombo struggled to pay its dues. 
Australia in particular, which has long viewed the Pacific as its backyard, has been critical of some Chinese aid projects, and a former foreign minister has warned that the lending could undermine the long-term sovereignty of recipients.
Malielegaoi said in a speech to the institute that unidentified ""traditional"" partners had ""left the neighborhood, even if momentarily"" and returned to find the region more hotly contested.
""Our partners have fallen short of acknowledging the integrity of Pacific leadership and the responsibility they carry for every decision made in order to garner support for sustainable development in their nations,"" he said. 
""Some might say there is a patronizing nuance in believing Pacific nations did not know what they were doing.""
A Reuters' analysis of the financial books of 11 South Pacific island nations shows China is the region's biggest bilateral lender, with loans jumping from almost zero to more than $1.3 billion outstanding in a decade.
Samoa is one of eight island nations in the South Pacific, carrying significant debt to China, but Malielegaoi said the terms were ""soft"" and repayments ""never any problem"". 
He also criticized a bid, abruptly abandoned after pressure from China, by his Tongan counterpart, 'Akilisi Pōhiva, to make a coordinated request for China to forgive loans across the region.
""It is never a good policy for a small country to keep on asking for loans and asking again for forgiveness, it destroys the country's integrity and relationship with friendly partners,"" he said.

425,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>",Parties deadlocked ahead of September Swedish election: poll,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden's main center-left and center-right political blocs are running virtually neck-and-neck just 10 days ahead of an election dominated by worries over immigration, and surging support for the populist Sweden Democrats, a poll shows.
The ruling Social Democrats are the biggest party and the center-left bloc, which includes coalition partner the Greens, and the Left Party hold a slim lead over the four-party Alliance bloc, the poll by Novus for Swedish Television showed.
Neither grouping looks like commanding anything close to a majority with the center-left on 40.2 percent and the Alliance on 38.9 percent.
Minority governments are not unusual in Sweden, but the make-up of the next administration remains in huge doubt because of the unaligned, anti-immigration Sweden Democrats who got 18.2 percent in the Novus poll.
In 2014, they got 13 percent, and their support was consistently under-estimated by polls in the run up to the vote. Some online surveys suggest the Sweden Democrats could now become the biggest party.
It burst onto the political scene in 2010, gaining seats in parliament for the first time. Since 2014, the party, which wants a full stop to immigration, has held the balance of power.
A deal with Sweden Democrat leader Jimmie Akesson would solve the political impasse, but he remains a pariah because of his party's past. It was founded in part by activists with white supremacist links.
Moderate Party leader Ulf Kristersson is bookies' favorite to take over from Prime Minister Stefan Lofven of the Social Democrats. But he has ruled out a formal deal with Akesson's Sweden Democrats.
Should he change his mind, he risks losing the support of parts of his own party, who ousted his predecessor after she held out an olive branch to the Sweden Democrats.
Furthermore, his Alliance partners in the Centre and Liberal parties want a return to laxer immigration policies and could jump ship if Kristersson gets too cozy with the Sweden Democrats.
Complicating the situation further, the Sweden Democrats have said they will vote down any government which does not give them influence over immigration policy.
Technically, they could side with the center-left to prevent the Alliance taking power after the vote, but they are seen more likely to support removing Lofven in the event of a virtual tie. 
None of the party leaders has given a clear answer about how they would deal with the different scenarios, leaving voters in the dark about what will happen after Sept. 9.
Weeks of horse-trading are likely before a new government is installed and prospects for an effective administration which can deal with key issues such as integration, housing and crime look slim.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria proposed on Thursday using European Union armed forces to support the bloc's border guards in barring undocumented migrants, as Vienna's conservative-far right coalition seeks tougher control of EU land and sea frontiers.
Defense Minister Mario Kunasek outlined his plan, based on Austria's past use of soldiers at its borders, to his EU counterparts at a closed-door meeting in Vienna, stressing that soldiers would be under police control, diplomats said.
""We have got to protect our borders effectively,"" Kunasek told reporters after the meeting, saying there was a ""positive discussion"" on the proposal.
Several EU governments separately expressed concern, reflecting divisions among member states on how to handle migration, resettle refugees within the bloc and prevent further waves of arrivals.
But Austria - the new chair of the EU's six-month rotating presidency - is determined to push the bloc to prevent any repeat of the 2015 crisis when more than a million migrants arrived in Europe from North Africa and the Middle East.
Italy and Hungary have also fiercely rejected the EU's current migration policy, respectively ordering ports closed to most migrant arrivals by sea and building a border wall.
The proposal to put the military at the service of the EU's Frontex border agency follows an Austrian drill in June, overseen by the country's far-right interior minister, which enacted the arrival of hundreds of migrants and involved Black Hawk helicopters and soldiers.
The EU already has a naval mission in the Mediterranean which goes after people traffickers. On land, however, efforts to deepen military, police and civilian border cooperation have not progressed, despite a declaration to do so by more than a dozen countries in central and southeastern Europe in 2017.
Germany and Estonia were among the doubters on the Austrian plan. ""There are very few ways that the military, even theoretically, can be used in border areas,"" Estonia's Defense Minister Juri Luik told Reuters. ""If you don't have a military conflict, everything can be handled by police."" 
One Austrian official said the proposal aimed at creating a system to use European militaries' assets, such as medical units, helicopters and soldiers, if police were overwhelmed.
Police or civilian authorities would also oversee any operations involving soldiers and could decide if personnel were armed or not, the official said.

The European Commission has proposed raising the number of EU border guards to 10,000 in the next seven-year EU common budget from 2021, from just several hundred today. Austria believes soldiers could either support them or be used until Frontex reaches that level.

China's foreign ministry on Wednesday dismissed a report by the South China Morning Post that cited sources with ties to the military as saying it was funding construction of a camp in Afghanistan's narrow Wakhan Corridor linking the two countries, and could send hundreds of troops there.
The Hong Kong newspaper later updated its report to quote Afghanistan's embassy in Beijing as saying China was helping the country set up a ""mountain brigade"" to boost counterterrorism efforts, but that there would be ""no Chinese military personnel of any kind on Afghan soil at any time"".
Chinese defense ministry spokesman Wu Qian, asked about the mountain brigade at a regular monthly news briefing, said China and Afghanistan had ""normal military and security cooperation"".
""China and the international community are all supporting Afghanistan to strengthen its defense and counterterrorism building efforts,"" Wu told reporters. 
""At present, both sides are in communication and coordination about the relevant matter. China is willing to continue working hard with Afghanistan to jointly protect both countries and regional security and stability,"" Wu said.
""As for the so-called reports on China stationing forces in Afghanistan, this does not accord with the facts,"" he said, without elaborating.
Reports have repeatedly pointed to China seeking a military presence in Afghanistan, although it has denied them.
In January, the defense ministry dismissed a report that it planned to build a military base in Afghanistan, and it previously refuted assertions that Chinese military vehicles were patrolling in the south Asian nation.
China has long worried that militancy in Afghanistan could spill over into its violence-prone Xinjiang region, home to the Muslim Uighur people.
In recent years, hundreds of people have been killed in the far western region in unrest China blames on Islamist militants.
China has also worked with Pakistan and the United States to broker peace talks to end Afghanistan's Taliban insurgency that has raged since the militants were ousted by U.S.-backed forces in 2001.

Last year, China opened its first overseas military base, in the Horn of Africa country of Djibouti. It has previously denied having plans for other overseas bases, but the United States expects it to build more, with Pakistan a possible location.

The announcement the ministry's spokesman Wu Qian comes two months after U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis visited Beijing. China said that visit yielded positive results, and Defense Minister Wei Fenghe has accepted an invitation to visit the United States before the end of the year.
Speaking at a regular monthly news briefing, Wu said that Shen plans to visit the United States in the middle or towards the end of next month, to attend an international naval forum and also to pay a working visit to the country.
He gave no other details.
Ties between the two countries have been strained on a number fronts in recent months.
In May, the Pentagon withdrew an invitation to China to join a multinational naval exercise, citing China's military moves in the South China Sea. The U.S. decision upset Beijing and was raised during the visit by Mattis, Chinese officials said at the time.
Beijing and Washington are also locked in a spiraling trade row that is threatening to worsen the relationship across the board, from cooperation on North Korea to the disputed South China Sea.
U.S. backing for self-ruled Taiwan have also fueled China's suspicions in recent months, as the current U.S. administration has signaled fresh support towards the island that Beijing claims as its own.
The navy has been a key part of President Xi Jinping's ambitious military modernization program that has rattled nerves around the region, though China says it has no hostile intent.
Wu separately announced that the country's second aircraft carrier has begun its second round of sea tests, leaving from its base in the northern port city of Dalian, where it was built.
China's Maritime Safety administration earlier on Thursday said an area of the northern part of the Yellow Sea off Dalian would be closed to shipping for military drills from Friday for a week-long period.
The still-unnamed carrier, the first to be built domestically, was launched last year, but Chinese military experts have told state media it is not expected to enter service until 2020, once it has been fully kitted out and armed.

Little is known about China's aircraft carrier program, which is a state secret. But the government has said the new carrier's design draws on experiences from the country's first carrier, the Liaoning, which was bought second-hand from Ukraine in 1998 and refitted in China.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The archbishop who sparked a crisis in the Catholic Church by calling on Pope Francis to resign has denied he was motivated by personal vendetta and said he sought to show that corruption had reached the top levels of the Church hierarchy.
Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano has gone into hiding since conservative media published an 11-page statement in which he alleged the pope knew for years about sexual misconduct by an American cardinal and did nothing about it.
Vigano has been communicating through Aldo Maria Valli, an Italian television journalist who Vigano consulted several times before releasing his statement last Sunday when the pope was in Ireland.
Italian media has reported he was upset because he was never made a cardinal by former Pope Benedict or because Francis blocked his further advancement in the Church.
""I have never had feelings of vendetta and rancor in all these years,"" he was quoted as telling Valli, who has been publishing statements from Vigano in his blog.
""I spoke out because corruption has reached the top levels of Church hierarchy,"" said Vigano, a former Vatican ambassador to Washington.
The Vatican had no comment on the new accusations by Vigano. 
In his statement, Vigano accused a long list of current and past Vatican and U.S. Church officials of covering up the case of Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who resigned last month in disgrace.
One of the people he attacks in the statement is Cardinal Tarciscio Bertone, who was secretary of state under former Pope Benedict.
Italian media reports have said Vigano was upset because Bertone had blocked any possibility of him becoming a cardinal.
In his comments published on Valli's blog, Vigano says he himself gave up the possibility of becoming a cardinal ""for the good of the Church"".
Vigano did not include any supporting documents in his remarkably blunt statement in which he said cover-ups in the Church were making it look like ""a conspiracy of silence not so dissimilar from the one that prevails in the mafia"".
On his flight home from Ireland on Sunday, Francis told reporters he would ""not say one word"" about the accusations.
""Read the document carefully and judge it for yourselves,"" he said. 

Francis' supporters say the statement contains holes and contradictions and note that Vigano prepared it with help from two journalists who have been critical of Francis, citing this as evidence that it forms part of an ideological anti-Francis strategy. The journalists deny this.

YANGON (Reuters) - Government restrictions on lifesaving aid for displaced people in northern Myanmar could constitute a war crime, advocacy group Fortify Rights said on Thursday, as pressure grows for accountability for rights abuses in the country.
The rights group released a detailed report on aid restrictions just days after U.N.-mandated investigators said Myanmar’s military carried out mass killings and gang rapes of Muslim Rohingya in Rakhine State in the west of the country with “genocidal intent"".
Myanmar rejected the report saying the international community was making ""false allegations"".
Myanmar has come in for criticism for blocking aid agencies from conflict-torn parts of Rakhine, and has also faced accusations of cutting off thousands of people displaced by fighting between government forces and ethnic minority guerrillas in Kachin State and the north of Shan State, both in the north.
""The government of Myanmar's wilful deprivation of humanitarian aid to displaced civilians in Kachin State violates domestic and international law, and could amount to a war crime,"" said David Baulk, a Myanmar human rights specialist for Fortify Rights.
Reached on Thursday, government spokesman Zaw Htay said he was in a meeting so could not comment. Military spokesman Major General Tun Tun Nyi could not immediately be reached.
Baulk said the U.N. Security Council should refer Myanmar to the International Criminal Court to investigate.
Fortify Rights closely monitors human rights in Myanmar and said it conducted nearly 200 interviews, most in Kachin State, over a five-year period to reach its conclusions
Myanmar officials have in the past justified restrictions saying aid was being diverted by guerrillas to support their insurgencies.
More than 100,000 people have been displaced in the mountainous region bordering China and India since 2011, when a ceasefire between the government and Kachin insurgents broke down.
La Rip of the Kachin Development Group aid organization told a news conference organized by Fortify Rights in the city of Yangon that aid groups like his were forced to evade government restrictions to get help to internally displaced people.
Fortify Rights said its research showed that in the year to June, only 5 percent of aid workers' applications to travel in government-controlled areas in the north were granted.

HELSINKI (Reuters) - The European Union needs a strategic relationship with Turkey, including in defense matters, and should modernize its post-Cold War relations with Russia, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday.
Macron is a strong advocate for a Europe that is able to defend its strategic interests and financial independence and respond to new global economic and defense situation brought on by Donald Trump's presidency in the United States.
He has sought to improve relations with Russia's President Vladimir Putin, although his efforts have been complicated by allegations of Russian meddling in elections from the United States to France and a nerve agent attack in Britain. 
""It is in our interest for the EU to have a strategic relationship with Turkey as well as with Russia that brings stability, that will in the long term and bring more strength and coherency,"" Macron said in a news conference in Helsinki alongside Finnish President Sauli Niinisto. 
He said the EU's relations with Russia needed to be ""brought up to date"", using the Italian word ""aggiornamento"".
""I think that on matters like cybersecurity, defense, strategic relationships, we could envisage the outlines of a new relationship between Russia and the EU which is coherent with the direction Europe is headed in,"" Macron said.

""Stability in the whole region is in our interest.""

Although President Joko Widodo has promised to ease media curbs in Indonesia's easternmost province, which is still one of its poorest, journalists face challenges in reporting from the region. 
The province has battled a long-running separatist movement since it was incorporated into Indonesia after a widely criticized U.N.-backed referendum in 1969 and remains the country's most heavily militarized region. 
Jakub Fabian Skrzypski entered Indonesia on a tourist visa but was suspected of reporting as a journalist, said the spokesman, Arrmanatha Nasir. 
""We are investigating the whole thing, because his coverage plans are suspected to be related to illegal activity,"" Nasir added, without elaborating.
Skrzypski was arrested last week with two Papuans on their way to meet representatives of armed groups waiting to buy ammunition, the Jakarta Post newspaper said. 
The Polish embassy in Jakarta did not immediately comment on the incident.
A BBC journalist was forced to leave Papua this year after the military said messages she posted on social network Twitter during her assignment had been misleading.

Cheung Kie-chung, 53, a mechanical engineering professor at the University of Hong Kong, was charged with the murder of his wife on August 17 at the hall of residence where he lived, a charge sheet seen by Reuters showed.
He appeared in the Eastern Magistrates' court briefly, with the case adjourned until Nov. 22.
Cheung, who is also a member of the university's governing council, did not enter a plea but told the court he understood the charge he faced, public broadcaster RTHK said.
The magistrate, Li Chi-ho, permitted Cheung to be placed on suicide watch while in custody, it added.
Cheung had called the police on August 20, saying his wife had gone missing after an argument, police said. 
Police suspicions were aroused, however, after CCTV footage showed no evidence of his wife leaving the building during that period. Cheung could also be seen moving out a large wooden box, said a police superintendent, Law Kwok-hoi.
A police raid on Cheung's office uncovered a white box containing a bloodstained suitcase in which was found a woman's partially decomposing body, with a cable round the neck, Law said.
It is Hong Kong's second recent murder case in which a professor has figured.
Khaw Kim Sun, 53, of the Chinese University of Hong Kong's anesthesia and intensive care department, has pleaded not guilty to accusations of murdering his wife and daughter in 2015 using a yoga ball filled with carbon monoxide and left in a car.

The group, led by Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Chris Smith, Republican co-chairs of the bipartisan Congressional Executive Commission on China, made the call in a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
Muslims in China's far western region of Xinjiang were ""being subjected to arbitrary detention, torture, egregious restrictions on religious practice and culture, and a digitized surveillance system so pervasive that every aspect of daily life is monitored,"" said the letter, signed by 15 U.S. senators and representatives, besides Rubio and Smith.The letter, signed by nine Republicans, seven Democrats and one Independent, called for sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act against senior Chinese government and Communist Party officials overseeing the policies, including Xinjiang party chief Chen Quanguo, and for other measures to be considered.
The Magnitsky Act was originally designed to target Russian Rights violators, but has been expanded to allow sanctions for abuses anywhere in the world.
""The Chinese government is creating a high-tech police state in (Xinjiang) that is both a gross violation of privacy and international human rights,"" the letter said.
China has said Xinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists who plot attacks and stir up tension between the mostly Muslim Uighur minority who call the region home and the ethnic Han Chinese majority. 
In Beijing on Thursday, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the United States did ""not have the right"" to make ""unwarranted criticism"" of China's policies toward ethnic minorities, and pointed to racial discrimination in the U.S.
""If viewed without bias or prejudice, China's ethnic minority policies, and the rights and equality ethnic minorities enjoy, are even stronger than in the United States,"" she told a regular news briefing.
She said U.S. lawmakers should concentrate on serving Americans rather than ""interfere with the domestic affairs of other countries"", adding that China protected religious freedoms in line with the law.
A United Nations human rights panel this month said it had received many credible reports that 1 million ethnic Uighurs in China were held in what resembled a ""massive internment camp that is shrouded in secrecy.""
Hundreds of people have been killed in violence in Xinjiang in recent years, prompting the tough security measures.
The U.S. lawmakers' letter said as many as a million or more Uighurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities were being detained in ""political re-education"" centers or camps, and called for ""a tough, targeted, and global response.""
It added, ""No Chinese official or business complicit in what is happening ... should profit from access to the United States or the U.S. financial system."" 
The U.S. State Department has said it is deeply troubled by Beijing's crackdown in Xinjiang, but has declined to comment on the possibility of future sanctions on Chen and others.

Critics have said the security and surveillance in Xinjiang have created near martial law conditions, with police checkpoints, reeducation centers and mass DNA collection.

The migrant, who police did not name, was walking home in Wismar, a town on the North Sea coast, when the attackers stopped him and began insulting him in German using xenophobic language. Two then punched him in the face and the third hit his shoulder and ribs with an iron chain, police said.
They then kicked him on the ground. The migrant suffered a broken nose and bruising to the face and upper body. Police, who gave no details about the victim's ethnicity, appealed for witnesses to come forward.
The incident occurred days after the violent protests in the eastern city of Chemnitz that were triggered by the fatal stabbing of a German man there. An Iraqi and a Syrian have been arrested in connection with that crime.
The Chemnitz stabbing and subsequent protests have exposed deep divisions in German society over Chancellor Angela Merkel's 2015 decision to open the door to more than one million migrants, mostly Muslims fleeing conflicts in the Middle East.
Both Chemnitz and Wismar are in the formerly Communist eastern part of Germany, where anti-immigrant pressure groups including PEGIDA and the Alternative for Germany (AfD) political party have their heartlands.

The probe by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) is the latest in a widening crackdown by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's government on corruption allegedly linked to the administration of his predecessor, Najib Razak.
Earlier this week, the anti-graft agency arrested eight former officers of the Malaysian External Intelligence Organisation (MEIO), including its former head Hasanah Abdul Hamid, on suspicion of misappropriating about $12 million in government funds.
""We are looking into possible abuse of power by the officers involved, and the misuse of funds, which we believe were government funds,"" MACC's deputy commissioner of operations Azam Baki said at a press conference.
Investigators have seized about $6.5 million in cash and valuables from various locations, including the MEIO's headquarters at the prime minister's office in Putrajaya, the country's administrative capital.
A Malaysian businessman with permanent residence status in the United Kingdom has also been detained, Azam said, adding that investigators were still looking for the remainder of the funds.
He said authorities were still investigating the source of the funds, but did not rule out the possibility that the money was linked to billions of dollars allegedly stolen from Malaysian state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). 
""Yes, we are looking into that angle also,"" he said. 
The money was believed to have been brought into Malaysia from another country, he said, declining to name the country.
Authorities in six countries, including Switzerland and the United States, are investigating how billions of dollars went missing from 1MDB, founded by Najib in 2009. 
The U.S. Department of Justice says over $4.5 billion was misappropriated from the fund, with some of the money used to buy a private jet, a superyacht, Picasso paintings, jewelry and real estate.

Najib has been charged with money laundering and corruption offences related to about $10 million allegedly transferred into his bank account from a former unit of 1MDB. He has plead not guilty to the charges.

SEOUL (Reuters) - There were no tearful hugs when 81-year-old South Korean Jung Hak-soon met her North Korean nephew and sister-in-law for the first time.
Instead, she says, she just wanted to return home.
""It was like I met someone I don't know at all,"" said Jung, who was among 89 South Korean families who joined in reunions last week of relatives separated by the Korean War, fought from 1950 to 1953.
""I wish my nephew resembled my brother, but he did not. They were like strangers,"" she told Reuters, days after the event held in North Korea's tourist resort of Mount Kumgang.
""I don't want to meet them again. I don't know how other separated families felt, or maybe I am just cold-hearted."" 
While many wept and embraced loved ones they were meeting for the first time in more than six decades, others, such as Jung, couldn't connect at all with their Northern relatives.
The disconnect shows how far apart the neighbors have grown in the decades since they ended hostilities in a truce rather than a peace treaty, leaving them technically in a state of war.
As war survivors on both sides age and in some cases, die, nearly half of those attending the events from August 20 to 26 met for the first time distant relatives such as grandchildren or nephews, rather than children or immediate siblings.
The long separation brought not only emotional distance but a difference in political outlook. 
For example, South Korean Cho Kwon-hyeong said he became uncomfortable at hearing praise of the North Korean leadership from the wife of his nephew living in the North.
""They said this meeting could happen thanks to Kim Jong Un,"" the 80-year-old added. ""There were no other words except that.""
Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in agreed at a summit in April to resume the reunion events after a gap of three years.
Those attending from the North are believed to have been chosen on the basis of their loyalty to the regime. In the South, participants are picked by computer, weighing factors such as their age.
The most important news Cho gleaned during the interaction was that his brother had died.
""I hadn't heard from him since he was taken by the North Korean military during the Korean war,"" he added. ""I didn't even know if he was alive or not.""
It is a shame the neighbors have so many families who die without ever learning if relatives across the border survived, said the South's Moon, who himself comes from such a divided family. 

More than 75,000, or nearly 57 percent, of the 132,484 South Koreans who signed up since 1988 hoping to reunite with families have already died, a government registry shows.

446,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 02:50AM ET</span>",China launches platform to stamp out 'online rumors',"BEIJING (Reuters) - China has launched a platform, which includes a mobile app, that lets the public report ""online rumors"" and even uses artificial intelligence to identify reports that are false, as Beijing cracks down on what it views as socially destabilizing content. 
The platform, launched on Wednesday, comes as Beijing steps up efforts to police the internet, especially social media used by people to discuss politics and other sensitive subjects, despite stringent censorship. 
Besides a website, the platform Piyao - which means ""refuting rumors"" - also has a mobile app and social media accounts with social media giants Weibo and WeChat. 
Via those channels, Piyao will broadcast ""real"" news, sourcing reports from state-owned media, party-controlled local newspapers, and various government agencies. 
""Rumours violate individual rights; rumours create social panic; rumours cause fluctuations in the stock markets; rumours impact normal business operations; rumours blatantly attack revolutionary martyrs,"" Piyao said in a promotional video of the launch on its website. 
Official data show internet regulators received 6.7 million reports of illegal and false information in July, with most of the cases coming from Sina that owns Weibo, Tencent which owns Wechat, Baidu, and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA). 
Chinese laws dictate that rumor-mongers could be charged with defamation, and they face up to seven years in prison. Online posts that contain rumors visited by 5,000 internet users or are reposted more than 500 times could also incur jail sentences.
Hosted by the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission in affiliation with the official Xinhua news agency, Piyao has integrated over 40 local rumor-refuting platforms and uses artificial intelligence to identify rumors. 
The platform operates under the guidance of 27 government departments, including the Central Party School, which trains rising officials, and powerful planning body the National Development and Reform Commission. 
Chinese media regularly reports on - and refutes - popular rumors that circulate online, though generally only mentions topics involving issues like corrupt local officials or health scares, rather than anything more salacious about senior leaders.

President Xi Jinping said last year that China will build a ""clean and clear"" internet space.

SWAR CREEK DAM, Myanmar (Reuters) - As many as 85 villages were flooded in Myanmar after a dam failed, unleashing waters that blocked a major highway and forced more than 63,000 people from their homes, a state-run newspaper said on Thursday.
The disaster spotlights safety concerns about dams in Southeast Asia after last month's collapse of a hydroelectric dam in neighboring Laos that displaced thousands of people and killed at least 27. 
Firefighters, troops and officials launched a desperate rescue effort on Wednesday after the spillway of an irrigation dam burst at Swar creek in central Myanmar, sending a torrent of water through villages and the nearby towns of Swar and Yedashe.
By Thursday morning the water was receding, but two people remained missing and were feared to have been washed away, said Min Thu, deputy administrator of Yedashe.
""People whose villages are on higher ground are preparing to go back to their villages,"" he told Reuters.
The ruptured spillway had flooded 85 villages, affecting more than 63,000 people and submerging a section of highway, the Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper said.
Traffic between Myanmar's major cities of Yangon and Mandalay and the capital, Naypyitaw, was disrupted after the flooding damaged a bridge on the highway linking the cities.
INTERNAL PROBE
Work was underway on Thursday to repair the dam, where the water level had dropped by several meters, exposing sandy banks.
A priority was to get as much water into the reservoir as possible before the dry season when it is needed for irrigation, said Kaung Myat Thein, an irrigation official at the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation.
He said a probe would seek the cause of the dam breach.
""The retaining wall of the spillway sank into the foundation about 4-5 feet, causing the flooding, but the main dam is intact,"" said Kaung Myat Thein. 
Days before the breach, authorities had given the all-clear to the dam, which can hold 216,350 acre-feet of water, despite residents' concerns about overspill, state-run media have said.
Kaung Myat Thein said the dam was regularly inspected and a spillway collapse could not have been predicted. 
""We could not know one day before, one hour before,"" he said.
FIELDS RUINED
As floodwaters receded, elders gathered at Oo Yin Hmu, a village of about 1,000 people only a few miles downstream from the dam, to review the damage. 
Paddy fields stretching from the edge of the village were inundated. It would be years before they could be planted with rice again, said Zaw Zaw, a 45-year-old farmer.
Residents ran to higher ground to escape the floodwaters, he said, but many lost their homes and possessions and were expected to ask the regional government for compensation.
""My house was at the northern part of the village and all houses in the northern part didn't survive,"" said Pan Ei Phyu, 24, a villager who escaped with her family, buffalos and cows.

""All of my farmland is turned into mud now. I don't have land or anything else anymore. I don't know what to do.""

448,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 02:32AM ET</span>",Australia's east coast drought to intensify as dry weather to linger for months,"By Colin Packham
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's east coast will experience dry weather for at least the next three months, the country's meteorological bureau said on Thursday, intensifying a drought that has wilted crops and left farmers struggling to stay in business.
In its latest three-month outlook, the Bureau of Meteorology said there was only a 30 percent chance rainfall would exceed average levels over much of the country's east coast during spring, which runs from September to November.
If the drought gets worse, Australia's agricultural sector will suffer further crop losses, while farmers will also be forced to slaughter livestock in greater numbers as they struggle to find enough food or water to keep them alive.
The bureau also raised the prospect of dry weather in the country's west, which has so far escaped drought conditions, bringing new concerns for Australian food manufacturers.
Unable to source enough grain from the east coast, some food producers have started to import supplies from Western Australia, where recent favorable weather had encouraged farmers to sell leftover supplies.
But the bureau said the west coast - the country's largest agricultural producing region - will also experience drier than average weather over the next three months, tightening national supply yet further.
""East coast farmers have largely written off wheat crops this year, but the issue could be the situation in the west,"" said Phin Ziebell, agribusiness economist, National Australia Bank.
""Some had been calling for a crop in excess of 10 million tonnes (in Western Australia), but if the forecast materializes, the figure will be under threat.""
Production of wheat from the world's fourth-largest exporter is already expected to hit a decade low this year, although output from the west is expected to cushion the decline in the east.
The bureau also said it saw a 50 percent chance of an El Nino weather event, which can bring warmer weather and dry conditions to Australia and could extend the dry weather into 2019.

""An El Nino basically means that as we get into summer there'd be less chance of having those recovery rains that we need and we may have to wait till autumn in 2019 to start seeing some recovery rains in the drought areas,"" said Andrew Watkins, manager of long range forecasts at the Bureau of Meteorology.

449,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 02:31AM ET</span>","For a 'house church' in Beijing, CCTV cameras and eviction","By Christian Shepherd
BEIJING (Reuters) - The Zion church in Beijing, one of the city's largest unofficial Protestant ""house"" churches, has operated with relative freedom for years, hosting hundreds of worshippers every weekend in an expansive, specially renovated hall in north Beijing.
But in April, city authorities asked the church to install 24 closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras in the building for ""security"", Zion's head pastor, Jin Mingri, told Reuters.
""They wanted to put cameras in the sanctuary where we worship. The church decided this was not appropriate,"" Jin said over tea in his spacious, book-lined office. ""Our services are a sacred time."" 
When the request was refused, police and state security agents started harassing churchgoers, calling them, visiting them, contacting their workplace and asking them to promise not to go to church, according to statements from the church and interviews with attendees. 
China's constitution guarantees religious freedom, but since President Xi Jinping took office in 2012, Beijing has tightened restrictions on religions seen as a challenge to the authority of the ruling Communist Party. 
China's religious affairs bureau and the public security ministry did not respond to faxed requests for comment. 
The Chinese government says greater oversight of religious activities is needed in order to regulate believers and facilitate worship, as well as to prevent foreign forces from influencing China's internal affairs using the guise of religion.
HOUSE OR OFFICIAL
China's Christian believers are split between those who attend unofficial ""house"" or ""underground"" churches and those who attend government-sanctioned places of worship. 
The unofficial establishments, which range from small living room-gatherings to large, professional operations like Zion, had in recent decades been tolerated by authorities.
They were often able to rent large spaces, though these are rarely identifiable from the outside. The only church exteriors in China adorned with steeples or crosses are officially sanctioned.
In February, new legislation increased oversight of religious education and practice, with harsher punishment for practices not sanctioned by the authorities.
In addition to being asked to install security cameras, some unofficial churches have been asked by police to take detailed lists of attendee IDs and phone numbers, churchgoers and activists say.
Some who push back have been visited by police and asked to switch places of worship to officially sanctioned churches, they added. 
The Zion church, which occupies an office building floor that was previously a nightclub, is now being evicted despite previous verbal assurances from its landlord that it could rent the location until 2023, Jin said. The landlord could not be reached for comment.
Jin does not expect to be able to find a landlord that would rent the church another suitable location.
RARE PROTEST
There are roughly 60 million Christians in China, most of them Protestant, with about 10 million Catholics, according to independent estimates.
The Vatican and Beijing are locked in talks to resolve a decades-long dispute over appointing bishops in China that, if resolved, could make underground Catholic churches official, with Holy See-approved bishops
On July 23, more than 30 of Beijing's hundreds of underground Protestant churches took the rare step of releasing a joint statement complaining of ""unceasing interference"" and the ""assault and obstruction"" of regular activities of believers since the new regulations came into effect, according to a copy of the statement seen by Reuters and confirmed by Jin.
""We call on the government to respect history and the current situation of house churches, respect the means and practices of religious work, and respect citizens' basic freedoms and rights to believe,"" the letter said.
Wang Yu, a prominent rights lawyer who has defended Christians from harassment and was recently baptized at Zion after years of worship there, said she believes the pressure on believers is an attempt to force the church to close.
""The authorities hope numbers will dwindle till it becomes impossible to continue, but in recent months ever-more churchgoers have been attending service,"" she said.
Wang fears, however, the situation will worsen, given the authorities have started describing the church as a ""cult"" when pressuring churchgoers. In one of its statements, Zion also says authorities have called the church a cult.
""Being labeled a cult was how it all started for the Falun Gong in 1999,"" Wang said, referring to the spiritual movement the Communist Party banned that year.
The new regulations have increased government pressure on the churches to ""sinicize"" - to be culturally Chinese and submit to oversight from the Communist Party - but many have resisted, saying this would be a fundamental betrayal of their faith.
""House churches believe that our spiritual needs and the content of our faith is ruled over by God,"" Pastor Jin said. 

""What we need is the freedom to believe. Without this, it is not real faith.""

Jeong Kyeong-doo, 58, a former fighter pilot, would take over the ministry as the government seeks to reduce tension and build trust with North Korea, and at a time of uncertainty over relations with main ally the United States.
Jeong, who is set to replace incumbent Song Young-moo, does not need parliament's approval but must attend a hearing and answer legislators' questions. 
He would be South Korea's first defense minister with an air force background in 24 years, media reported. 
The United States is seeking to press North Korea to give up its nuclear and missile programs and as part of that effort, U.S. President Donald Trump suspended military exercises with South Korea when he met North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un in a historic June summit.
But with talks between North Korea and the United States stalled, there is speculation the South Korean-U.S. exercises, which the North has long denounced as preparations to invade it, might get going again.
Trump said on Wednesday there was no reason to resume the exercises but U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis on Tuesday made remarks that were interpreted as hinting the drills could resume.
At the same time, South Korea is making efforts to improve ties between the two Koreas. 
The South Korean defense ministry has said it will reduce the number of guard posts and the amount of equipment along the demilitarized zone, on its border with North Korea, under an agreement between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at an April summit.
The 1950-1953 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty, leaving the countries still technically at war. 
Moon and Kim plan to meet for the third time this year in September. 
Meanwhile, Moon also named new ministers of labor and industry.
The new labor minister nominee, Lee Jae-kap, must deal with the worst job market since the 2008-2010 financial crisis.

Unemployment is seen as having contributed to a plunge in Moon's approval ratings this month to its lowest ever.

451,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 01:40AM ET</span>","As debt levels rise, more Thais struggle to keep up","By Orathai Sriring and Satawasin Staporncharnchai
BANGKOK (Reuters) - Pimpa Panlao, 31, is struggling to pay off an 80,000 baht ($2,440) bank loan and spends a third of her income from selling women's accessories at a Bangkok market to repay the loan.
""Business is bad and it's very tough when you have debt,"" Pimpa told Reuters, who used part of the loan to finance her business. She is not alone.
With a debt mountain of 12.17 trillion baht ($372 billion) at the end of March, the equivalent of 77.6 percent of gross domestic product, Thai households are among the biggest borrowers in Asia and they are finding it increasingly difficult to keep up with payments.
In addition, their debt pain could increase because the Thai central bank has signaled it is likely to follow other central banks around the world and raise interest rates from near record lows.
Non-performing mortgages, defined as those that have not been serviced in more than three months, were 3.39 percent of total home loans at the end of the second quarter, the highest level since the end of the global financial crisis in 2009.
Auto loans that have been delinquent for one to three months rose to 7.25 percent at the end of June, the highest since September last year, and compared with 6.97 percent at the end of March.
Private consumption is a critical element driving the Thai economy, accounting for half of its $490 billion GDP.
Consumers continued to borrow at a robust pace in the second quarter, when overall consumer debt rose 8 percent from a year earlier. That included a 6.2 percent rise in mortgage loans and a 12.4 percent jump in car loans.
But the risk is that an increasing debt burden will drag on Southeast Asia's second-largest economy. 
The latest GDP figures for the second quarter showed the economy's expansion slowing down from the first quarter, although the state planning agency, the National Economic and Social Development Board, kept its 2018 growth forecast unchanged at 4.2-4.7 percent.
But economists said expansion remains heavily reliant on exports as the high levels of household debt weigh on consumers. That was underlined by a central bank index that showed private consumption did not grow in June from May.
DISTRESSED
JMT Network Services, Thailand's top unsecured consumer debt collector, expects consumer debt to rise further this year, with housing loans making up half of the total.
""As consumer loans increase, bad debt will also rise. Now we also see more secured loans, particularly home loans, turning sour. We are buying more of that too,"" Sutthirak Traichira-aporn, chief executive of JMT, which buys bad loans and provides debt collection services in Thailand.
JMT predicts a 30 percent rise in profit in 2018 on top of last year's record profit, Sutthirak said.
The firm manages 3.2 million distressed debt accounts worth 128 billion baht and aims to amass more this year, he said.
""We can buy any bad debt we want in the market. It's very big, much bigger than us,"" he said.
One struggling debtor, Rosukon Chakkrapongwan, fears she may lose her house as she struggles to keep up payments on a 4 million baht home loan she took up three years ago.
""It was not a problem two years ago. But this year, business is very bad as people don't spend,"" said the 44 year-old trader, who earns 30,000 baht a month selling cosmetics. More than half of that goes towards paying off her debt.
""I have failed to service my debt for three months now"".
She also fears the worst if the central bank raises interest rates.

""This would make life even more difficult. I don't know if I can keep my house,"" she said.

453,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 12:57AM ET</span>",Former Texas policeman jailed for 15 years for black teen's murder,"(Reuters) - A white former Texas policeman was jailed on Wednesday for 15 years over the deadly shooting of an unarmed black teenager in a Dallas suburb last year that fueled a national debate over possible racial bias in U.S. policing.
The same jury that convicted Roy Oliver, 38, of murder on Tuesday in the death of Jordan Edwards, 15, deliberated for several hours before deciding his prison sentence.
Oliver's conviction was a rare instance in which an officer was found guilty of murdering an unarmed person.
""This case is greater than Jordan,"" said Daryl Washington, a lawyer for the Edwards' family. ""We just hope there are going to be some changes."" 
In emotional testimony during the penalty phase of the trial on Wednesday, Oliver's mother asked the jury to sentence her son to the minimum five years, in large part because of the needs of his young son who has autism.
""That's my prayer because he could still have such an impact on that child's life,"" Linda Oliver told the jury.
Oliver's lawyer, Bob Gill, said they would appeal against the sentence, a Texas ABC affiliate reported. 
Two police officers who worked with Oliver and a neighbor were among those testifying as character witnesses.
Prosecution witnesses on Tuesday included Edwards' father, Odell Edwards, who said the last thing he told his son was that he loved him.
Oliver, along with another officer, had responded to reports of underage drinking at a house party in the predominantly black and Hispanic city of Balch Springs, about 15 miles (25 km) southeast of Dallas.
Oliver fired his rifle several times into a car with several teens inside, prosecutors said. Edwards, a standout high school student and athlete, was shot in the head and killed. 
The jurors deliberated for about 12 hours over two days before reaching their verdict after a trial that began in mid-August.
Michael Snipes, the first assistant district attorney, said Oliver was a trigger-happy policeman who sent the teenager to an early grave.
The arrest warrant for Oliver said he and the other officer tried to stop a car at an intersection near the party. The other officer broke a passenger window with the butt of his gun.
Police body camera images displayed to jurors showed the car was moving away from Oliver when he fired at it.

Oliver's defense attorney, Jim Lane, said the vehicle was a threat to Oliver's partner that night and he reacted to save his partner by firing into the car.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's next government will discuss a potential new investigation of the 2014 disappearance of 43 students with human rights experts who dispute the findings of the current administration, three people familiar with the matter said.
The abduction and suspected massacre of the trainee teachers in the southwestern state of Guerrero precipitated one of the worst crises of President Enrique Pena Nieto's government.
The administration concluded the bodies of the missing were incinerated in a garbage dump, but experts appointed by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) said that account was riddled with errors. 
The same experts will meet next month with President-Elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's team to discuss a possible resumption of work on the case, said two people familiar with the investigation. 
They said they were not authorized to speak publicly because the IACHR has yet to make a formal declaration whether it would extend the mandate of the investigators, known as the Interdisciplinary Group of Independent Experts.
A member of Lopez Obrador's team confirmed plans for the meeting without providing details, and also requesting anonymity ahead of an announcement from the IACHR.
The leftist leader, who will take office on December 1, said he would set up a truth commission to analyze the case, but has not provided details of how it would operate. 
On Wednesday, Pena Nieto reiterated his government's findings about the young people, who attended a college in the town of Ayotzinapa.
""There was clear and conclusive evidence that very sadly the 43 young people had been incinerated by a criminal group,"" he said. 
That conclusion was widely questioned by domestic and international human rights experts.

The IACHR's Interdisciplinary Group of Independent Experts said the investigation was flawed, including the torture of witnesses who had allegedly participated in the disappearance of the students.

455,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 12:45AM ET</span>",Bangladesh protests stir opposition hopes of revival before poll,"(In this Aug 29 story, deletes repeated words ""Prime Minister"" in paragraph 2.)
By Zeba Siddiqui and Ruma Paul
DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh's main opposition party, in disarray since its leader Khaleda Zia was jailed in February, received an unexpected boost this month - days of protests by tens of thousands of students that have shaken the government ahead of a December election.
What began as an outpouring of anger over the failings of an unregulated transport industry after a speeding bus killed two students in Dhaka, quickly escalated into the widest anti-government protests in the South Asian nation in years, providing a focus for discontent with what critics see as Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's increasingly authoritarian rule.
""The government is trying to control everything,"" said Rabiul Alam, 28, who works in a curtain showroom in Dhaka. ""There is no space, no freedom, no democracy. You can't even criticize the government on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).""
Alam, who is a voter in his hometown in Barishal, in southern Bangladesh, said he would vote for the first time this year - for Khaleda's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). Analysts say such views are on the rise around the country.
The protests, which saw students directing traffic for days in the choked streets of Dhaka, demanding to check drivers' licences and vehicles' roadworthiness, have put Hasina and her ruling Awami League on the defensive in the run-up to an election she was widely expected to win.
The BNP says it was not involved in starting the protests, but is looking to capitalize on the opening they have been offered with rallies across the country aimed at pressuring the government to release its leader.
""The protest was spontaneous and non-political,"" said BNP secretary-general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir. ""The students have showed us the state is in need of repair.""
The government has blamed the BNP for inciting the students.
To quell the protests, Hasina announced compensation to the victims' families and the government agreed to raise the maximum jail time for rash driving to five years from three.
But heavy-handed policing of demonstrations and a wave of arrests fueled accusations that free speech is increasingly being curtailed. The government said its actions were necessary to restore order.
BUS TRAGEDY
The protests erupted after the driver of a speeding private bus lost control in a congested part of Dhaka and plowed into a bus stop, killing two students. Most private bus drivers in Bangladesh do not get paid a salary, but earn commission for the number of people they pick up, leading them to race each other for passengers.
Demonstrations quickly spread to the cities of Chittagong, Khulna, Rajshahi, Sylhet, Rangpur and Mymensingh, as the protests struck a chord.
Hasina's government, which began her term in 2009 cracking down on Islamist groups and sending top leaders to the gallows for war crimes during the 1971 independence war, is seen by some as increasingly high-handed after nearly a decade in power.
In February, a court handed Khaleda, a two-term prime minister with whom Hasina shares a long and bitter rivalry, a five-year sentence for corruption - charges that she says are part of a plot to keep her and her family out of politics.
In recent months, Hasina has faced criticism that her political opponents are being swept up in the ongoing drive against militancy, corruption and drugs, which has also seen security forces accused of overstepping the law.
The police's response to the protests - by firing rubber bullets, water cannons, and teargas at unarmed students - has drawn international criticism for the government, including from the United States and United Nations.
The government has ordered police to patrol school and college campuses to head off further trouble.
Sayed Nasirullah, an assistant commissioner with the Dhaka metropolitan police, said at least 20 students had been arrested on suspicion they spread ""rumours and propaganda"" on social media. Social activist and photographer Shahidul Alam, who had posted comments that a student wing of Hasina's ruling party was trying to attack the protesters, was held on similar charges.
BNP BENEFITS?
The government has said it had to impose control because rival politicians got involved in the protests.
""There are forces within and outside the country waiting for any popular issue and then mold it to their advantage,"" Hasina's political adviser, Hossain Toufique Imam, told Reuters. ""There's no doubt that there are enemies of the government who are trying to take every opportunity to destabilize it.""
Hasina won the 2014 election for a second five-year term after Khaleda boycotted the polls in protest at the scrapping of the practice of installing a neutral caretaker government to oversee elections. Her party says it will decide in the next few weeks whether to continue with the boycott. 
Analysts say the government's response to the emotionally charged student protests means Hasina may now face a much tougher fight to retain power than seemed likely a few months ago, if the BNP decides to take part - even though several leading BNP members are in jail on various charges.
The BNP, facing near-extinction with Khaleda's jailing, hopes it has found the lifeline it needed.
""The student protests showed that people have lost their faith in the Awami League,"" said Shahadat Hossain, BNP president for the southeastern district of Chittagong.
Anger at the ruling party may not fully translate into votes for the BNP, however.
""The way the ruling party handled the protests was not appropriate. This will definitely have some negative impact on the ruling party,"" said Nakibur Rahman, 23, a private university student in Dhaka who will be a first-time voter in December.

""All my family members are Awami League supporters. They are not switching sides but I have not taken any decision yet. But I am not going to vote for the BNP either.""

Manning, the transgender U.S. Army soldier who served seven years in military prison for leaking classified data, is scheduled to speak at the Sydney Opera House at the weekend.
However, Suzi Jamil, owner of the company organizing Manning's speaking tour in Australia, said late on Wednesday Manning had received a notice from the Australian government informing her Canberra was considering cancelling her visa.
""We are looking for support from relevant national bodies or individuals, especially politicians, who can support Chelsea's entry into Australia,"" Jamil said.
A spokeswoman for Australia's Department of Immigration declined to comment on the possible visa ban on Thursday.
Australian law allows the immigration minister to deny anyone a visa if they do not pass a character test, a broad criteria that affords the government sweeping powers.
Manning is scheduled to travel to New Zealand after finishing her three events in Australia but the center-right opposition National Party has also called for her to be denied entry.
Manning was denied entry into Canada late last year but was subsequently allowed to appear at another event. 
Manning was sentenced in 2013 to 35 years in prison for sending more than 700,000 documents, videos and diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks. Her sentence was later commuted by former President Barack Obama.

The classified and sensitive documents leaked by Manning - who was assigned to an army unit in Iraq as an intelligence analyst - shone a light on the nature of warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Canadian David Roach is accused of having stolen S$30,000 ($22,758) from a branch of  Standard Chartered  bank (LON:STAN) in 2016 by handing a threatening note to a teller. He then fled to Thailand with the money.
""All challenges fail,"" said district judge N Tempia of the Westminster magistrates' court.
Roach's lawyer had appealed against the extradition, in court documents seen by Reuters, citing Singapore prison conditions, the fact that his client was jailed in Thailand, and concerns that Singapore would not keep its promise.
The case sparked debate at the time about whether Singapore, which has a very low crime rate, had become too complacent on security. The decision on Roach's extradition has now been passed to Britain's secretary of state.
""Singapore authorities are working closely with the UK authorities on the next steps in this matter,"" Singapore's home affairs ministry and its attorney-general's chambers said in a joint statement late on Wednesday. 
Singapore wants Roach on one count of robbery, carrying a minimum jail term of two years and at least six strokes of the cane, and on one count of money laundering. In February, Singapore agreed to waive corporal punishment.
After fleeing to Thailand, Roach was jailed for 14 months for not declaring such a large amount of money upon arrival.
Singapore authorities said they had repeatedly asked Thailand to send Roach back to face charges, but it decided to deport Roach to Canada in January.
However, en route home, he was detained by British police at London's Heathrow Airport at the request of Singapore, a former British colony that has an extradition treaty with Britain, but not Thailand.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Days after canceling a planned visit to North Korea by his top diplomat citing insufficient progress in denuclearization talks, U.S. President Donald Trump hailed his personal relationship North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Wednesday and said there was no reason to resume war games with South Korea.
Trump's statement came a day after his defense secretary hinted that the drills, which North Korea denounces as rehearsals for invasion, could resume.
Trump tweeted a White House statement in which he once again questioned China's role in helping to resolve the crisis over North Korea's development of nuclear weapons that threaten the United States.
The statement said Trump believed North Korea was under ""tremendous pressure"" from China, but Beijing was also supplying Pyongyang with ""considerable aid,"" including fuel, fertilizer and commodities. 
""This is not helpful!"" the statement said.
""Nonetheless, the President believes that his relationship with Kim Jong Un is a very good and warm one, and there is no reason at this time to be spending large amounts of money on joint U.S.-South Korea war games,"" it added.
""Besides, the President can instantly start the joint exercises again with South Korea, and Japan, if he so chooses. If he does, they will be far bigger than ever before.""
The statement also said that the U.S. trade dispute with China and other differences ""will be resolved in time by President Trump and China’s great President Xi Jinping. Their relationship and bond remain very strong.""
Trump caught many American military planners off guard when he announced after an unprecedented summit with Kim on June 12 that the United States was suspending this summer's joint military drills with South Korea. 
CONCESSION CRITICIZED AS PREMATURE
The move was broadly criticized as a premature concession to North Korea, which has resisted U.S. efforts to persuade it to give up its nuclear weapons.
On Tuesday, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis noted that the suspension of joint military drills with South Korea as a good-faith gesture to North Korea was not open-ended. 
On Wednesday, he reiterated that no decisions had been made about suspending any future exercises and stressed the importance of the U.S. alliance with South Korea. 
The United States and South Korea have internally agreed to carry out the joint military air drill ""Vigilant Ace"" in December and are discussing the size of the drill and the extent of the participation, South Korean newspaper Joongang Ilbo reported on Thursday, citing multiple unnamed government sources. 
In 2017, the week-long ""Vigilant Ace"" exercise involved a total of 230 U.S. and South Korean aircraft including stealth jets, according to the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command website. 
A Pentagon spokesman said, “Routine planning continues for major ROK-US exercises on the Peninsula in accordance with the normal exercise program planning cycle,” without elaborating. 
South Korea's defense ministry said that nothing has been decided about whether to hold ""Vigilant Ace"" this year. 
At the June summit, the first meeting between a serving U.S. president and a North Korean leader, Kim agreed in broad terms to work toward denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. But North Korea has given no indication it is willing to give up its weapons unilaterally as the Trump administration has demanded.
On Friday Trump called off a trip to North Korea by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo just hours after Pompeo had announced it and publicly acknowledged for the first time that his efforts to get Pyongyang to denuclearize had stalled.
North Korea has been seeking relief from tough international sanctions and a formal conclusion to the 1950-1953 Korean War, which ended in an armistice rather than a peace treaty.
But Washington says North Korea must give up its nuclear weapons first.
""We believe that denuclearization has to take place before we get to other parts, and that's been a part of our policy,"" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert reiterated on Wednesday.
U.S. officials say North Korean officials warned in a letter to Pompeo last week that talks with the United States risked falling apart. They now worry that Pyongyang may concentrate on trying to cut a separate deal with South Korea and in doing so driving a wedge between the U.S.-South Korea alliance.
“They basically don’t think we’re doing enough,” a senior U.S. official said on Wednesday, referring to the North Koreans. He said that the tone of the letter was “if you’re not willing to give something, then don’t come.”

U.S. intelligence and defense officials have repeatedly expressed deep doubts about North Korea's willingness to give up its nuclear weapons and had not expected Pompeo's trip to yield positive results.

(Reuters) - U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos will issue new rules to colleges and universities for addressing sexual harassment or assault cases, lessening their liability for incidents that happen off-campus, the New York Times reported on Wednesday.
The new policies would also strengthen the rights of students accused of assault, harassment or rape and seek to provide more support for victims, the Times reported.
Department of Education spokeswoman Liz Hill declined to discuss the proposed recommendations with Reuters.
""We are in the midst of a deliberative process. Any information the New York Times claims to have is premature and speculative, and therefore we have no comment,"" Hill said.
The report was published on the same day that officials said a former University of Southern California (USC) gynecologist, George Tyndall, accused of sexually assaulting hundreds of students, had agreed to a suspension of his medical license..
The Education Department is investigating how USC handled that case after the university acknowledged failing to properly act on at least eight complaints lodged against Tyndall between 2000 and 2014.
Last year, the administration of Republican President Donald Trump reversed guidelines established under President Barack Obama, a Democrat, on how colleges should handle sexual assault accusations, saying the prior policies led to too many students being falsely charged or disciplined. 
The prior rules outlined a strict set of steps for schools to follow or risk losing funding under Title IX, the federal law that bars sex discrimination in education. 
According to the New York Times, the rules being prepared by DeVos' office would preserve much of Title IX but would also for the first time legally define sexual harassment on campuses and how schools were expected to address formal complaints.
The proposals would hold colleges and universities responsible only for incidents on campus or in their programs and call for impartiality in investigating allegations and using the presumption that the accused student or staff member is innocent until proven guilty, the newspaper reported.
""The proposed campus sexual misconduct policies from Betsy DeVos and her Department of Education are just the latest example of the Trump administration turning its back on women and victims of sexual assault,"" the Democratic National Committee said in a statement.

""These proposed rules are a blatant and disturbing attack on every student who has experienced or could experience sexual assault or misconduct on a college campus, and they exemplify the misplaced priorities of DeVos and the Trump administration,"" the DNC said.

For almost an hour, thousands of people watched a masked beekeeper from the New York City Police Department painstakingly remove some 25,000 bees with a low-power vacuum. (https://reut.tv/2wm13Bo)
It may have been just a piece of light news on an August afternoon, but it illustrated a widening trend. 
""People like to watch things in real time,” said Natalie Armstrong, who manages live coverage for Reuters Digital in New York. 
Reuters carries an average of 20 live broadcasts daily (https://www.reuters.tv/live), streaming raw footage from events around the globe. At times, we may have as many as six live video feeds running simultaneously on our digital platforms, often in different languages. Some feeds come directly from Reuters video journalists and others are supplied by TV stations that are Reuters clients and share content. 
The New York City’s bee swarm already ranks as one of the most-watched live broadcasts this year, according to our internal tracking software. More weighty news events also draw big audiences. 
All live broadcasts capitalize on the power of social media to quickly attract large audiences, whether the event lasts a few minutes or hours. 
Some of the most popular live broadcasts include a May 10 press conference following a meeting of Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia’s new prime minister, and Malaysia’s King Sultan Muhammad V.; Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) founder Mark Zuckerberg’s two-day testimony in April before the U.S. Congress; and the June 5 court arrival of movie producer Harvey Weinstein, who was charged with rape and sexual misconduct.
Science-related topics, like the SpaceX Falcon test launch (http://www.reuters.tv/l/w7C/2018/02/06/spacex-falcon-heavy-debut-test-launch-with-tesla-roadster-payload) and Mars explorations (http://www.reuters.tv/l/PY0A/2018/07/25/scientist-briefing-after-detecting-liquid-water-on-mars), also attract large audiences because of interesting graphics and “the cool-factor,” Armstrong said. 
Airing live streams presents certain challenges, such as graphic content after violent events or unchecked profanity. To the extent possible, Reuters tries to warn viewers in advance that they may see or hear something that they could find disturbing. 

And unlike Reuters news stories, live broadcasts may feature a speech from a rally or press conference that is not fact-checked or is missing context, and sensitive information that may not be public might end up being heard over an open microphone.

LONDON (Reuters) - Former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond said on Wednesday he has resigned from the Scottish National Party, which he led for two decades, days after allegations of sexual misconduct became publicly known.
Salmond has denied the allegations and taken legal action against the SNP administration he once ran over the way it has handled the complaints against him. 
The driving force behind Scotland's 2014 independence referendum and still a popular figure in Scotland, Salmond said he was taking the action to protect the SNP from its opponents and avoid any internal division were he to have been suspended from the party.
""I did not come into politics to facilitate opposition attacks on the SNP and, with parliament returning next week, I have tendered my resignation to remove this line of opposition attack,"" Salmond said in a statement.
Salmond said he would reapply to the party if he wins his court action. At the same time he launched a crowd-funding appeal to raise 50,000 pounds ($65,000) to help pay his legal costs against the Scottish government over its handling of the misconduct complaints against him.
The Scottish government said last week two allegations of misconduct against Salmond were filed in January of this year. Salmond said he rejects any suggestion of criminality.
Salmond, who headed the devolved Scottish government for seven years until 2014, is credited with helping to push support for Scottish independence from the United Kingdom to record levels during the referendum campaign.
Scots, however, voted 55-45 percent in favor of staying in the UK. 
Nicola Sturgeon, his successor as party leader and first minister, has come under pressure from opposition parties to suspend his membership while the claims are investigated.
Sturgeon said she felt ""a huge sadness about this whole situation"" but understood why he decided to resign. 
She said that Scotland's battle for independence is ""bigger than any one individual.""
Salmond's relationship with his own party has been more strained since he lost his seat in the Westminster parliament last year.
""I am conscious that if the party felt forced into suspending me it would cause substantial internal division,"" Salmond said. He intended to reapply for party membership ""just as soon as I have had the opportunity to clear my name"", which he hoped would be by the end of the year.
""For my part I have always thought it a very poor idea to suspend any party member on the basis of complaints and allegations,"" Salmond said. ""Innocent until proven guilty is central to our concept of justice.""

The appointment of Philippe Besson as Consul General in Los Angeles is likely to raise eyebrows given he wrote a book lauding Macron during the 2017 election campaign and has no particular background as a diplomat.
Le Monde daily newspaper cited the French presidency as saying the decision was in line with a policy of ""widening appointment pools, like elsewhere in the public service"".
It did not comment when contacted by Reuters.
Besson, 51, has written some 20 novels with some adapted for the big screen. He was among a number of aides and celebrities Macron invited to a Left Bank brasserie the night after his first round triumph last year. 
Unlike the United States, where the president can make appointments in key foreign service positions, nominations in France are made after a procedural process at the ministry from thousands of diplomats in France and overseas.
However, a decree at the start of August modified the nomination rules for senior positions, including some 20 consul general postings, that are particularly sought after by career diplomats. 
Under the new regulations, those positions can now also be filled by the government if it wishes to do so, including with non-civil servants. 
That change and Besson's subsequent appointment has caused some unease among certain diplomats with foreign ministry unions questioning the rationale behind the decision, two diplomats said. 
""It is better to do the panegyric of the president than to qualify from ENA or speak languages. Old World?"" Michel Duclos, a former French ambassador to Syria and now Senior Fellow at the Paris-based Institut Montaigne think tank said on Twitter, referring to France's elite administrative school ENA. 
Diplomats have already seen their numbers fall after government spending cuts in recent years making competition tougher each year to move to new positions.

PHOENIX (Reuters) - Thousands of admirers of the late Senator John McCain stood in line for hours on Wednesday in the blazing Arizona sun and triple-digit heat for a chance to pay final respects to the war hero and two-time Republican presidential candidate.
The single-file procession through the Arizona Capitol rotunda, where McCain's flag-draped coffin was lying in state, stretched across the statehouse plaza and widened to two or three abreast as it extended down adjacent streets. 
More than a dozen canvas awnings were set up to provide shade for the throngs, with temperatures reaching 106 degrees Fahrenheit (41 degrees Celsius) at midday.
The public viewing of his casket, following a brief ceremony for family and dignitaries led by Governor Doug Ducey, came on the first of five days of memorial tributes planned for McCain, who died on Saturday from brain cancer. He was 81.
The onetime U.S. Navy fighter pilot endured 5-1/2 years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam before embarking on a celebrated political career. McCain stood out during the last two years as a key rival and critic of U.S. President Donald Trump, a fellow Republican whom McCain's family has asked not to attend the funeral.
Among several thousand waiting to glimpse McCain's coffin at Arizona's Capitol was James Fine, 54, a Dallas funeral director who drove over 1,000 miles (1,609 km) to Phoenix to bid farewell to a man he called a ""statesman.""
""I get up every day and read the news, and then I see what John McCain has to say,"" Fine told Reuters. ""They don't make heroes like him anymore.""
Earlier, the hearse bearing McCain's coffin was greeted outside the statehouse by National Guard troops, military veterans, law enforcement officers and firefighters, all in dress uniform and standing at attention as they saluted.
Inside, close relatives and dozens of politicians, including several former Republican colleagues from Arizona's congressional delegation, paid tribute to McCain's life and legacy during a 30-minute ceremony.
""He fought like hell for the causes he believed in,"" Ducey said. ""He did it with humor and humanity, and without compromising the principles he held so dear.""
McCain's wife, Cindy, widely seen as a possible candidate for appointment to succeed her husband, led a procession of 90 mourners past his casket. She paused briefly, stooping down to rest her cheek on the coffin, then patted it gently.
Their daughter Meghan McCain, co-host of the television talk show ""The View,"" sobbed openly. 
McCain will lie in state again at the U.S. Capitol on Friday, followed by a funeral Saturday at Washington's National Cathedral and a burial on Sunday at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. 

Ducey has said he will wait until after McCain's burial to name an immediate successor.

TAOS, N.M. (Reuters) - Two New Mexico judges on Wednesday dismissed child abuse charges against five people from a desert compound near Taos where a toddler's body was found, citing procedural errors by prosecutors.
The judges, in separate decisions issued in New Mexico's Eighth Judicial District Court, dismissed the child abuse charges on grounds that a preliminary hearing had not taken place within 10 days after they were filed on Aug. 8 when the defendants were taken into custody. 
Judge Jeff McElroy dismissed child abuse charges against Siraj Ibn Wahhaj and his wife, Jany Laveille. The two face separate charges for the death of Wahhaj's 3-year-old son, Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj, whose body was found earlier this month. Laveille, a Haitian national, is also being held on immigration charges.
Judge Emilio Chavez earlier ordered charges to be dropped against three other defendants, Subhannah Wahhaj; her husband, Lucas Morton; and sister Hujrah Wahhaj, and for them to be released from jail in Taos.
Chavez had given state prosecutors a deadline of 2 p.m. (2000 GMT) Wednesday to refile the charges, a move that would have kept those three defendants behind bars. State prosecutors had not refiled charges by then, according to the court clerk's office.
""We must comply with this rule and I must dismiss these charges,"" McElroy said, adding that the Eighth Judicial District Attorney's office in Taos County had failed to follow a basic procedural rule.
State prosecutor John Lovelace told the court he believed ""exceptional circumstances"" surrounding the inability of the defendants to meet bail requirements and leave jail meant the 10-day rule did not apply in this case.
Prosecutors have said they would present new evidence of a plot by the defendants to attack ""corrupt institutions.""
Defense attorneys say their clients have no record of criminal convictions and pose no risk to the public.
The five defendants were arrested after an Aug. 3 police raid on their makeshift encampment in Amalia, New Mexico, after reports that 11 children were starving there. The children were taken into protective custody.

The body of the missing 3-year-old Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj was found three days later in a tunnel at the compound. The severely disabled boy was abducted from Wahhaj's first wife in Georgia and died on Dec. 24, according to the Taos County Sheriff's office.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syrian government forces are preparing a phased offensive in the northwestern province of Idlib and surrounding areas, the last big rebel enclave, a source close to Damascus said on Wednesday.
Russia, President Bashar al-Assad's main backer from outside the region, said on Wednesday that militants there must be liquidated and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov described them as ""a festering abscess"". 
The offensive would initially target southern and western parts of the insurgent territory, but not yet Idlib city, said the source, an official in the regional alliance backing Assad.
""The final touches for the first stage will be completed in the coming hours,"" the official added, without saying when it would start. 
There were still negotiations over the offensive going on between Russia and Turkey, as well as with Iran which also supports Damascus in the war, the official said. 
Turkey, which borders Idlib and has a small military presence there, has warned against such an attack.
At the U.S. State Department, spokeswoman Heather Nauert said there were indications that Syrian forces were preparing an offensive on Idlib.
She said Washington's new representative for Syria, Jim Jeffrey, raised concerns about the possible offensive in a recent meeting with Russian ambassador to the United States.
""We are concerned not just about a potential chemical weapons attack, but we are concerned about any kind of escalation of violence in Idlib that would put civilians and civilian infrastructure in Idlib at risk,"" she added.
""We have shared the concerns we have about any potential offensive taking place with the Russian government at many levels,"" Nauert told reporters. 
Assad has turned toward Idlib, where jihadist factions dominate, after Russian-backed victories in recent years that drove the rebels from a mosaic of other areas in Syria.
The insurgents now hold only the territory in and around Idlib, as well as an adjacent rebel area in which opposition authorities are backed by Turkish armor and money, and a patch of desert around a U.S. military camp in the south. 
A major offensive in the Idlib area, where displaced people already make up half the population, risks forcing another 700,000 Syrians from their homes, the United Nations said. 
It also risks raising tensions with Turkey, whose army established a ring of observation posts around the rebel territory last year under a ""de-escalation"" deal with Russia and Iran. 
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said this month he hoped Ankara and Moscow could find a solution for Idlib, warning that a bombing campaign there would be a massacre. Ankara also fears a major offensive could unleash a new flood of refugees across the Turkish border. 
Lavrov said on Wednesday there was a political understanding between Russia and Turkey on the need to distinguish between the Syrian opposition and people he described as terrorists in Idlib.
HUMANITARIAN DISASTER
The first phase of the offensive will include the town of Jisr al-Shughour and the al-Ghab plain on the western side of the rebel territory, and the towns of al-Latamenah, Khan Sheikhoun and Maarat al-Numan in its south, the official said. 
Taking those areas would bring Assad close to regaining control over highways running from Aleppo to Hama and Latakia, two of Syria's most important pre-war roads. 
The army and its allies would also reinforce the western edge of Aleppo city in anticipation of a rebel assault there aimed at blunting the offensive, the official said. 
In recent weeks, the Syrian military has dropped leaflets over Idlib province urging people to surrender, opened a route for civilians to cross into government territory and, according to a war monitor, sent more reinforcements to the front. It has stepped up air strikes and shelling near the front lines, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has said. 
Idlib and surrounding areas outside government control are home to 3 million people, of whom 1.8 million are displaced. Many of the displaced people fled earlier offensives to escape the fighting or avoid coming back under Assad's rule - including those bussed to Idlib under ""evacuation"" deals when rebels surrendered other enclaves. 

Evacuations from eastern Ghouta, Deraa and other rebel territories captured by the government have contributed to the displacement of more than half a million people to or within Idlib in the past six months, the U.N. said.

Regeni disappeared on Jan. 25, 2016 while doing postgraduate research on Egyptian trade unions. His body was discovered on Feb. 3 and Egyptian investigators found signs of extensive torture. 
""I hope that by the end of the year we can get to a breakthrough, and that the meeting between the judicial authorities can take place as soon as possible,"" said Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, who serves in a populist coalition government that took office in June earlier this year.
""Both on the Egyptian side and on our side, there is willingness to ask for an acceleration,"" he said after a meeting with President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. 
Egypt's presidency said in a statement that Sisi affirmed during the Wednesday meeting with Di Maio ""his confidence in reaching the final results in the investigations into the killing of (Regeni), in light of the strong will to find the culprits and bring them to justice"". 
Intelligence and security sources told Reuters in 2016 that police had arrested Regeni outside a Cairo metro station on Jan. 25 of that year and then transferred him to a compound run by Homeland Security. 
Egyptian officials have denied any involvement in his death and Sisi said last month that Cairo was determined to conclude a joint investigation and bring Regeni's killers to justice. 
Di Maio said judicial officials from Italy and Egypt, which have been investigating the Regeni case jointly, were due to meet soon. 
Egyptian and Italian investigators have been working together to retrieve CCTV recordings from Cairo metro stations as part of the investigation. 
The two sides said in June that they had found gaps in the footage from inside and around Cairo metro stations and were trying to discover the cause. 
Di Maio said he had not discussed details of the case with Sisi, but that Regeni had topped the agenda of their talks. ""It's clear that the normalization of our relations has to come about through the truth about Giulio Regeni and (his) death,"" he said. 
""Both President Sisi and the members of the government present were more than willing and in agreement that the truth about Giulio Regeni should be established as soon as possible.""
The Regeni case strained relations between Italy and Egypt. Italy recalled its ambassador in April 2016 before restoring its diplomatic presence in Cairo last year. 

Italy is an important trade partner for Egypt, with 4.75 billion euros ($5.5 billion) in commerce per year according to Egypt's foreign ministry. Italian oil major Eni is among Egypt's top foreign investors.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu used a visit to a secretive Israeli atomic reactor on Wednesday to warn the country's enemies that it has the means to destroy them, in what appeared to be a veiled reference to its assumed nuclear arsenal. 
""Those who threaten to wipe us out put themselves in a similar danger, and in any event will not achieve their goal,"" he said during a ceremony to rename the complex, near the desert town of Dimona, after the late Israeli statesman Shimon Peres.
Netanyahu's remarks, issued by his office in a transcript, came as Israel lobbies world powers to follow the United States in exiting their 2015 deal with Iran that capped the Islamic Republic's nuclear capabilities.
The Israelis deem the agreement insufficient for denying their arch-foe the means to eventually get the bomb - something that Tehran, which is a signatory to the 1970 nuclear Non-Proliferation Treatry (NPT), denies wanting.
The reimposition of U.S. sanctions has put pressure on the Iranian economy, scaring off some foreign investors even as European powers try to salvage the 2015 pact. On Wednesday, Iran said it could abandon the accord.
Since its 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran has preached Israel's destruction. It backs the Lebanese militia Hezbollah and the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas. Its reinforcement of Damascus during Syria's civil war is seen by the Netanyahu government as a further Iranian deployment on Israel's borders. 
Israel, which is outside the NPT, neither confirms nor denies having the bomb, a decades-old ""ambiguity"" policy that it says keeps hostile neighbors in check while avoiding the kind of public provocations that can spark regional arms races.
The Israeli reticence has long been tolerated by Washington.
During a visit to Israel last week, U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton told Reuters that he met officials from the country's Atomic Energy Commission but that this should not be seen to signal any policy review by the Trump administration. 
""I don’t think there is anything out of the ordinary or unexpected,"" Bolton said of the meeting. Asked to elaborate, he added only: ""No change in policy.""
Israel has carried out scores of attacks against suspected Iranian and Hezbollah emplacements or arms transfers in Syria, with Russia, Damascus's big-power backer, turning a blind eye.
""The IDF (Israel Defence Forces) will continue acting with full determination and with full might against Iran's attempts to station forces and advanced weapons systems in Syria,"" Netanyahu said in his Dimona remarks.
The premier credited Peres, his predecessor and a Nobel Peace laureate who died in 2016, with setting up the reactor in the 1950s as part of a vision of ""normalization between core countries in the Arab world and a strong State of Israel"".

""This process ... is happening before our very eyes, on a scale that would have been impossible to imagine just a few years ago,"" Netanyahu said, alluding to Israel's discreet relations with Gulf Arab powers that see Iran as a common foe.

470,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2018 02:54PM ET</span>",Saudi-led coalition condemns U.N. rights report on Yemen,"RIYADH (Reuters) - The coalition of Arab states fighting against Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis on Wednesday denounced as inaccurate and biased a report by U.N. human rights experts that said some of its air strikes may amount to war crimes.
The experts' report, released a day earlier, said that the bombardment has caused heavy civilian casualties, raising concerns about the coalition's targeting process, while severe restrictions on Red Sea ports and Sanaa airport had deprived Yemenis of vital supplies.
The panel said Houthi fighters may also be guilty of war crimes, accusing them of restricting access for humanitarian aid and conscripting child soldiers.
The Houthis, who control the capital and most of the west of the country, regularly fire missiles on southern Saudi Arabia and occasionally aim for higher-value targets, such as the capital Riyadh or facilities of state oil company Aramco.
""The report had several methodological fallacies and misconstrued the facts of the conflict... ignoring the true reasons for the conflict which are the coup of the Iran-backed Houthi militias against the legitimate government in Yemen,"" said a statement published by the Saudi state news agency SPA.
Saudi Arabia is leading a Western-backed alliance of Sunni Muslim Arab states trying to restore the internationally recognized government of Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, ousted from the capital Sanaa by the Houthis in 2015.
The report was the first United Nations investigation into possible war crimes in Yemen although international human rights groups have regularly documented abuses. It was released ahead of U.N. peace talks between Hadi's government and the Houthis scheduled for Sept. 6 in Geneva.
The coalition said it would provide a ""comprehensive and detailed legal response"" at a later time. It rejected the report's assertion that it had not cooperated or provided information to the panel.
The experts said they did not examine the United States and Britain, who supply weapons and intelligence to the alliance, or Iranian support for the Houthis, but other U.N. bodies were doing so. They urged all states to restrict arms sales to help end the war.
The United Nations considers Yemen to be facing the most urgent humanitarian crisis in the world, with millions of people potentially facing starvation if the war disrupts supply lines needed to bring in aid.
The war has so far garnered relatively little public attention in Western countries, but there are signs that is starting to change, particularly because of the role Western governments play supplying arms to the coalition countries. 
A New York Times editorial on Wednesday condemned what it called ""American complicity"" in civilian casualties -- including dozens of children killed earlier this month in an air strike on a bus -- and urged Congress to cut military aid to Saudi Arabia.
""Saudi Arabia and its allies seem to have little compunction about slaughtering children as long as more bombs can be bought, so it's up to the enablers to call a halt,"" it said.
In Washington on Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition was not unconditional, but suggested the United States would continue to support the alliance as it worked to reduce the impact on civilians.
Amnesty International called on Washington, London and others to ""do everything in their power to prevent further violations (including) immediately stopping the flow of arms to the country and end the Coalition's arbitrary restrictions on humanitarian assistance and essential imports.""
The Houthi-controlled al-Masirah TV said earlier on Wednesday that the group had fired a ballistic missile at Saudi Arabia's Najran region near the border between the two countries, causing no apparent casualties. Saudi air defenses intercepted a missile fired toward the southern city of Najran on Tuesday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States cannot guarantee that it will provide India a waiver from sanctions if it purchases major weapon and defense systems from Russia, a top Pentagon official said on Wednesday, ahead of a high-level dialogue between Washington and New Delhi.
The United States has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia, under which any country engaged with its defense and intelligence sectors could face secondary U.S. sanctions. However, a new defense bill gives the president the authority to grant waivers in case of national security interests.
Randall Schriver, the Pentagon's top Asia official, said there was an ""impression that we are going to completely protect the India relationship, insulate India from any fallout from this legislation no matter what they do."" Media reports from the region have suggested that India would get a waiver.
""I would say that is a bit misleading. We would still have very significant concerns if India pursued major new platforms and systems (from Russia),"" Schriver said at a think tank event.
""I can't sit here and tell you that they would be exempt, that we would use that waiver, that will be the decision of the president if he is faced with a major new platform and capability that India has acquired from Russia,"" he added.
The Indian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has publicly been a strong proponent of granting India waivers.
The United States is concerned about India's planned purchase of Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile systems, Schriver said. Russia has said it expects to sign a deal with India later this year on the sale.
On Tuesday, Mattis said the United States was also concerned about Turkey's purchase of the Russian missile defense system, which cannot be integrated into NATO.
Schriver said the United States was willing to talk to India about potential alternatives.
Senior U.S. officials are expected to go to India next week for high level talks, agreed upon by U.S. President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
The meeting was originally planned for April but was postponed after Trump fired Rex Tillerson as secretary of state.

Washington put off the meeting for a second time in June.

ABUJA (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May urged Nigeria on Wednesday to tap into the City of London's financial expertise as she sought to build a new trading relationship with Africa's biggest economy and most populous nation.
With Britain set to leave the European Union next March, May is on a whistle-stop tour of Africa, her first to the continent as prime minister, hoping to bolster ties with the fast-growing economies of Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa.
""We offer... the important capacity to bring access to capital markets of the City of London, together with professional services expertise,"" May told reporters at Abuja airport before heading to Nigeria's commercial capital Lagos.
""I look forward to seeing more rich investment in Nigeria creating jobs for Nigerians and the good people of Britain as well,"" she added.
Earlier, May and Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari signed agreements on economic and defense cooperation.
""We have long-standing relations with Nigeria and long-standing, close commercial ties with Nigeria. There are British companies that have been here in Nigeria for many, many years. We want to enhance those trading links,"" she said.
""I think there's are real opportunities as we leave the European Union,"" said May, who back home is struggling to unite her divided Conservative Party over her plans to leave the EU.
In April, Britain hosted a meeting of Commonwealth countries, including South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria, seeking to reinvigorate the network of mostly former colonies and drum up new trade amongst its members.
In June, the City of London's Lord Mayor Charles Bowman, who acts as an ambassador for the British capital's financial district, said Britain and Nigeria were exploring ways to list naira-denominated bonds on the London Stock Exchange to help fund infrastructure projects.

On Tuesday May held talks with her South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa. She leaves for Kenya later on Wednesday.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany has launched a probe into the leak to far-right groups of an arrest warrant against an Iraqi suspect in a stabbing case that triggered two days of violent anti-immigrant protests. 
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said judicial authorities should use all means at their disposal to respond to the leak of the warrant for the arrest of the 22-year-old Iraqi suspect over the fatal stabbing of a 35-year-old German man.
The death sparked violent anti-foreigner protests in the eastern city of Chemnitz.
The leak of the warrant was a highly unusual occurrence that drew sharp criticism across Germany, which has strict privacy guidelines for judicial proceedings, and raised concerns of possible links between police and anti-migrant parties. 
Critics said the warrant, which contained details of the number of stab wounds, may have been leaked to further inflame anger against migrants.
The stabbing and subsequent protests have exposed deep divisions in German society over Chancellor Angela Merkel's 2015 decision to open the door to more than one million migrants, mostly Muslims fleeing Middle East conflicts.
The incident has also laid bare close links between a range of anti-migrant groups, including soccer hooligans and the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, and their ability to quickly mobilize thousands of demonstrators.
Prosecutors on Wednesday said they had launched an investigation into the leak and had taken steps to protect two witnesses named in the document.
The deputy premier of the state, Martin Dulig, a Social Democrat, suggested in two German media interviews that the leak had likely come from police or judicial authorities. ""We have a bigger problem to deal with there,"" he told broadcaster MDR.
A spokesman for the Dresden prosecutor's office, which is handling the investigation, said the circle of those who had access to the document was not small.
ANTI-MIGRANT RIOTS 
Neither the Iraqi, nor a second suspect arrested in the stabbing, a 23-year-old Syrian man, had engaged an attorney, making it unlikely the leak came from them, experts said.
Saxon police last week apologized for a separate incident involving an off-duty police employee at an anti-Islam rally. 
The AfD and PEGIDA, a far-right group that is under observation by intelligence agencies, say they will march again in Chemnitz on Saturday to ""mourn Daniel H. (the stabbing victim) and the others killed by Germany's forced multiculturalisation.""
PEGIDA co-founder Lutz Bachmann was among the first to publish the arrest warrant on Tuesday evening, along with a group called ""Pro Chemnitz"" and a local AfD politician.
Fifty-seven percent of Germans view the anti-migrant riots, during which at least 10 people raised their arms in the banned ""Hitler salute"", as a danger to democracy, a new Civey poll showed. 
Ninety percent of AfD backers did not see the protests as a threat to democracy, it showed.
AfD leader Alexander Gauland justified the anti-migrant riots as self-defense in an interview with Die Welt newspaper. ""When a homicide like this occurs, it's normal that people flip out. Self-defense is certainly not vigilante justice.""
Merkel and her cabinet discussed the situation during a cabinet meeting on Wednesday and underscored their opposition to any form of vigilance justice, Seehofer told reporters. Such actions were ""completely unacceptable.""

But U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein called for more widespread denunciation of what he called ""shocking"" images from Chemnitz. ""We really need a concentration of voices now to say that when we have incitement to hatred this is prohibited under international human rights law,"" he told reporters.

In keeping with his earlier promise to get to the bottom of the much criticized army action after he was declared the first elected head of state since Robert Mugabe's removal from power in November, Mnangagwa said the panel would be expected to make public its findings within three months.
Mnangagwa told reporters that one of the terms of reference of the panel included establishing whether the degree of force used by the army was appropriate.
""The terms of reference are as follows, to identify the actors and their leaders, their motive and strategies employed in the protests, to investigate the circumstances which necessitated the involvement of the military in assisting the maintenance of law and order,"" said the president.
Optimism about Zimbabwe turning a new page in the aftermath of the first election since Mugabe was removed in a de facto coup last year quickly evaporated when opposition supporters took to the streets on Aug. 1 to protest against what they described as rigging by the election board.
Riot police tried to disperse protesters in the capital Harare but military armored vehicles unexpectedly rolled onto the streets. Soldiers fired live rounds and beat opposition supporters. Six people were killed.
The panel, which will have seven members including four foreigners, will be chaired by Kgalema Motlante, who served as South Africa's president for eight months in 2008-2009 after the resignation of Thabo Mbeki. It includes Rodney Dixon, a London-based human rights barrister.
Human rights groups have reported more than 150 incidents of alleged abuses by security forces against opposition supporters, including illegal detention, assault, looting and rape. Some figures in the opposition MDC have fled their homes and their whereabouts are unknown.

Mnangagwa's government has denied carrying out abuse.

BERLIN/LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union is prepared to offer Britain an unprecedentedly close relationship after it quits the bloc but would not allow anything that weakened the body's single market, chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said on Wednesday.
With seven months to go until Britain is due to leave the EU, the two sides are yet to reach a divorce deal. Officials increasingly expect an informal October deadline to slip into November.
Britain's Brexit minister Dominic Raab told lawmakers on Wednesday he was confident that a deal was ""within our sights"", although he added that there was ""some measure of leeway"" on the October timetable.
Sterling, which has come under pressure from growing concerns over the chances of Britain leaving the EU without a deal, rallied sharply after Barnier's comments.
""We are prepared to offer Britain a partnership such as there never has been with any other third country,"" Barnier told reporters in Berlin on Wednesday after a meeting with German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, adding that that could include economic as well as foreign and security policy ties.
""We respect Britain's red lines scrupulously. In return, they must respect what we are,"" he said. ""Single market means single market ... There is no single market a la carte.""
Earlier this month Barnier said the two sides could have a trade agreement of ""unprecedented scope"".
RAMPING UP 
The British government has been ramping up its no-deal preparations and last week published the first in a series of advice to businesses on how to prepare for the possibility it makes a clean break from the EU on March 29.
Quizzed by a committee of members of Britain's upper house of parliament on Wednesday, Raab cited the Irish border and the issue of data-sharing as among the main outstanding elements still to be agreed.
Raab said Britain could not be cavalier about the risks of a no-deal Brexit, an outcome which he said could be triggered at several different levels from the negotiators to the member states or the European parliament.
If a deal isn't reached, Britain could choose to withhold some payments to the EU, Raab said. 
As part of a Brexit transition deal, Britain has agreed to pay the EU between 35 and 39 billion euros ($41-$46 billion) over the coming decades. But Raab said not all of this was a legal obligation.

""I don't think it could be safely assumed on anyone's side that the financial settlement that has been agreed as part of the withdrawal bill would then just be paid, in precisely the same shape or speed or rate, if there was no deal,"" he said.

TUNIS (Reuters) - Hundreds of migrants have been abandoned without food or water in government-run detention centers in the Libyan capital after guards fled from clashes between rival armed groups in the past few days, aid workers said on Wednesday.
Tripoli has been shaken since the weekend by fighting between rival groups vying for power and state funds, a recurring theme in the North African country since the messy overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in a 2011 NATO-backed uprising.
Some 400 people were abandoned in the Ain Zara detention center run by the U.N.-backed government, one aid worker said, asking not to be identified.
Ain Zara in southern Tripoli is part of a network of state facilities where Libya holds migrants intercepted by the coastguard while trying to reach Italy by boat with the help of human traffickers.
""There are about 400 people locked in the Ain Zara detention center, among them 200 men and 200 women and 20 children under five years without food and water,"" the aid worker said. ""The guards of the center have fled due the current clashes in the city.""
A source at an international organization said some 1,500 migrants had been originally trapped in three detention centers. Some had escaped, while others had been transferred to detention centers in safer areas.
Libya is the main departure point in North Africa for migrants crossing the Mediterranean to Europe, mainly from other parts of Africa. The numbers have fallen since Italy provided the coast guard with more boats and brokered deals with local groups in a smuggler hub last year.
There was no immediate comment from the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) which formally is in charge of Libya but in reality is not even in full control of the capital.
Residents said there was more fighting going on in several parts of Tripoli on Wednesday, including in the area of Tripoli International Airport, which has been closed since 2014 by fighting between militia groups.
Tripoli’s big armed groups claim to have official status through the GNA, but act with autonomy. A rival government is based in the east.

The country's southern shores have become the main gateway into Europe for migrants seeking a better life, ahead of Italy and Greece, particularly since Italy's new populist government began refusing to admit rescue boats. 
Human rights groups complained the return was carried out too quickly to give the migrants access to legal assistance and interpreters, and to identify asylum seekers, while political opponents criticised the government's approach as inconsistent.
Spain's Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who took office in June, put migration at the heart of his new government's policies when he agreed to receive more than 600 migrants aboard a charity-run ship, the Aquarius.
The migrants who stormed the fence last week, some of whom threw a corrosive substance which left police officers with burns, were returned to Morocco the following day.
""Spain and Morocco wanted to send a clear message this time to the criminal organizations that traffic people,"" Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska told a parliamentary commission. 
""We will not permit violent migration that attacks our country and our state security forces,"" he added.
African migrants have for years tried to enter Europe by climbing the razor-wire topped fences that separate the two Spanish territories of Ceuta and Melilla from Morocco. 
The route accounts for some 13 percent of total illegal migrant arrivals in Spain.
On Wednesday alone, the Spanish coast guard said it had rescued 196 people from eight boats in the narrow Gibraltar Strait that separates Spain from Morocco.
The government's immigration policy was based on ""solidarity, humanity and security"" and the returned migrants had been assisted, Grande-Marlaska said. 
Police said on Tuesday they had arrested 10 migrants who crossed the barrier in July, accusing them of belonging to a criminal organization, attacking state authority, and causing damage.
In that incident, migrants hurled plastic bottles of excrement, quick lime and makeshift incendiary devices at police to dissuade them from halting their efforts to scale the fence. [L5N1UM7TL]
""You started by receiving the migrants from the Aquarius and being applauded across Europe,"" said Ione Belarra, a deputy with anti-austerity party Podemos.
""We have seen a radical change in your migration policy,"" she added.

MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's Atlantia rejected the idea of nationalizing its Autostrade unit on Wednesday but did not rule out cooperation with state-run funds, drawing renewed criticism from politicians.
In an interview in La Repubblica newspaper Atlantia CEO Giovanni Castellucci said Autostrade per l'Italia was a key part of the infrastructure group, adding nationalization would be a return to the past.
A bridge on the A10 motorway in Genoa run by Autostrade collapsed on Aug. 14, killing 43 people. The Italian government has blamed the unit for serious oversights and launched a formal procedure to revoke its concessions.
""Autostrade is part of the historical heritage of Atlantia, of which it is the most important asset. There are no other scenarios (on the table),"" Castellucci said in the interview published on Wednesday.
Autostrade, which runs 3,000 kilometers (1,964 miles) of highways in Italy, accounts for more than 60 percent of its parent company's core earnings.
Autostrade per l'Italia, which was privatized by the Italian government in 1999, is currently 88 percent owned by Atlantia which in turn is controlled by the Benetton family. Other investors are Allianz (DE:ALVG) SE and China's Silk Road Fund.
Two sources told Reuters last week that Italy's ruling coalition was considering the idea of state-run Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) buying into Autostrade as a way for the state to regain some sort of control of the asset. 
The Italian Treasury, which controls CDP, has said it is not aware of any such plans.
""There is no plan, no contact (over CDP) ... However I can say that cooperation with institutional investment funds, even linked to governments ... is in our DNA,"" Castellucci said.
But Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio reaffirmed later on Wednesday his hard-line stance on Autostrade, dismissing the idea of CDP taking a stake in the unit. 
""The Atlantia CEO says we shouldn't nationalize, (but) says the state having a stake in Autostrade is OK. First you create this mess and then you want (CDP to buy) a stake to save yourself on the market ... This is not our goal,"" he said.
CDP in the past has provided funding for Atlantia, including last year a 1.7 billion euro ($2 billion) loan to Autostrade.
Asked by La Repubblica if he had considered resigning, Castellucci said he was focused on resolving the emergency situation in Genoa and at Autostrade.

Speaking in a radio interview, Temer said it could be necessary to put a daily cap on the number of Venezuelans allowed to cross the border into Roraima as local authorities were being overwhelmed by a migration crisis.
Hundreds of thousands of people are fleeing economic meltdown and political turmoil in Venezuela, where people scrounge for food and other necessities of daily life. The exodus is threatening to overwhelm neighboring countries.
Most of those head to other Spanish-speaking countries in South America, but a rising number are heading to Brazil via Venezuela's remote southern frontier.
Temer said an estimated 700 to 800 Venezuelans cross the border at the town of Pacaraima every day.
Brazil may limit that number to between 100 and 200 people per day, the president said, just hours after his government vowed to send armed forces to maintain order in the area.
""It is inadmissible what is happening there [Venezuela]. It is plunging the continent into discord,"" Temer said. 
Residents of Pacaraima ran riot this month and drove out Venezuelan immigrants after a restaurant owner was stabbed and beaten. The demonstrations forced many immigrants to flee back across the frontier to their crisis-striken country.
Temer said the decree to reestablish law and order in Roraima will be in effect for 15 days.
The exodus of Venezuelans to other South American countries is building toward a ""crisis moment"" comparable to events involving refugees in the Mediterranean, the United Nations said this week.
Top immigration officials from Peru, Colombia and Brazil met in Colombian capital Bogota on Tuesday to discuss how to cope with the influx.

There are close to 1 million Venezuelans now living in Colombia and more than 400,000 in Peru, the countries said in a joint statement after the meeting.

On Monday, U.N. investigators said Myanmar's military carried out mass killings and gang rapes with ""genocidal intent"", and the commander-in-chief and five generals should be prosecuted for the gravest crimes under international law.
Aung San Suu Kyi, who leads the Myanmar government and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for campaigning for democracy, has been criticized for failing to speak out against the army crackdown in Rakhine State.
""It's important to remember that a Nobel Prize, whether in Physics, Literature or Peace, is awarded for some prize-worthy effort or achievement of the past,"" said Olav Njoelstad, the secretary of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. 
""Aung San Suu Kyi won the Nobel Peace Prize for her fight for democracy and freedom up until 1991, the year she was awarded the prize,"" he said.
And the rules regulating the Nobel Prizes do not allow for a prize to be withdrawn, he added.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee consists of a panel of five Norwegians, mostly former politicians and academics, that reflect the different forces in the Norwegian Parliament. The other Nobel prizes are awarded in Sweden.
Last year, the head of the Committee, Berit Reiss-Andersen, also said it would not strip the award after previous criticism of Aung San Suu Kyi's role in the Rohingya crisis.
""We don't do it. It's not our task to oversee or censor what a laureate does after the prize has been won,"" she said in a television interview. ""The prize winners themselves have to safeguard their own reputations.""

483,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2018 11:09AM ET</span>",Russia's Putin offers women a better pensions deal after popularity hit,"By Andrew Osborn and Andrey Ostroukh
MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday he was cutting a proposed retirement age for women from 63 to 60 years as he watered down draft legislation to reform the pensions system which has hurt his popularity and stirred protests.
In a TV address, Putin, who once promised to never raise the retirement age, took responsibility for the first time for the reforms which he said were needed to protect state finances, ensure stability in society and safeguard national security.
Proposed reforms put forward by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev's government had envisaged raising the retirement age to 65 from 60 for men and to 63 from 55 for women. 
The issue has proved politically sensitive for Putin, who was re-elected in March, and prompted protests across Russia after it was announced on June 14, the day Russia played the first match of its soccer World Cup.
Opinion polls show that around 90 percent of the population oppose the government's original proposals. The issue contributed to driving Putin's popularity rating down to 67 from 80 percent earlier this year, according to the Levada Centre pollster, its lowest since before Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea.
In his TV address Putin put his name to changes to the pensions system, but he said he was softening parts of the reform, including cutting the proposed retirement age for women by three years to 60.
""The demographic development and labor market trends and an objective analysis of the situation show that we can't put this off any longer,"" said Putin. ""But our decisions must be fair, balanced and absolutely take into account people's interests."" 
""That's why I am proposing a raft of measures that will allow us to soften the decisions taken as much as possible.""
""We have a special, caring attitude to women in our country,"" he added, explaining his move to soften the blow for women.
Putin's spokesman has said the Russian leader is unfazed by fluctuations in his popularity but had decided to act on the pensions question because of its importance.
Having highlighted that Russia currently spends 20 billion roubles ($293.13 million) a day to pay pensions, Putin outlined other specific change proposals to the pension system related to the different groups of Russians, such as women with several children, and others.
Adjustments to the pension reform proposed by Putin would cost the state budget a around 500 billion roubles over the next six years and would ""require adjustments to ... budget plans,"" Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said. 
'THREAT TO STABILITY'
It was not immediately clear if Putin's intervention would be enough to defuse public anger. But state television, the main source of news for most Russians, presented his intervention in a positive light, as did politicians from the ruling United Russia party.
Raising the retirement age would allow the government to pay out bigger pensions, whose current size he described as modest. The government says the average monthly pension will be 14,414 roubles ($212) by the end of the year.
Putin said the draft legislation, which is going through the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, would be amended to reflect his own ideas in the near future.
He listed several ways of raising money to fund the current pension system in order to delay reform, but said all of them would only work in the short term. Further out, they would end up destroying the economy, which has been battered by years of Western sanctions.
""In the long term, if we hesitate now, it could threaten stability in society and hence national security,"" said Putin.
Putin's political opponents, including opposition leader Alexei Navalny, have tried to tap into public anger over the proposed changes by organizing protests.
A court sentenced Navalny to 30 days in jail on Monday after convicting him of breaking public protest laws, a move he said was illegal and aimed at stopping him leading a rally against pension reform next month.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - The center-right frontrunner to become Sweden's next leader said future governments would have to be ""humble"" to survive, hinting that negotiations on a new ruling coalition would be the hardest in modern times amid a rise in the far right.
While still shunned by all main parties, the Sweden Democrats, founded in part by white supremacists in the 1980s, are now backed by one in five voters and will sorely test any new prime minister's ability to form a viable government.
""I'm not going to set out my conditions in advance. I note that we have a responsibility to our voters to try to implement our policies and do the best we can,"" Moderate Party leader Ulf Kristersson told Reuters, cautioning against high expectations.
""It is a whole new parliamentary situation,"" Kristersson, 54, a soft-spoken pragmatist, said in an interview at party headquarters in an upscale district of downtown Stockholm.
""Every new government will need, by Swedish standards, to be a humble government which understands that it is the parliament that holds the power, not the government.""
Negotiating directly with the nationalist Sweden Democrats, whose message that immigration is tearing apart the country's generous welfare state has polarized politics, remains officially out of the question for rival parties. 
Few know the cost of breaking the taboo better than Kristersson, who last year took over the Moderates when his predecessor was ousted for saying she was willing to talk to the Sweden Democrats.
While Kristersson is the bookies' favorite for premier, his Moderates are polling poorly and their four-party Alliance is likely to need at least tacit support from the Sweden Democrats to replace the Social Democrat-led government.
""We will not negotiate with the Sweden Democrats on forming a government, nor regarding whether that government can take power, nor regarding a budget. That won't happen,"" he said.
BALANCING ACT
Sweden's Migration Agency is forecasting the Nordic country will take in some 23,000 asylum seekers in 2018, the fewest in five years and a long way off the record 163,000 in 2015, when more than one million migrants streamed into the European Union. 
Under Kristersson, the Moderates have discarded the liberal ""open-border"" views of former leader and premier Fredrik Reinfeldt and increasingly aligned immigration policy with that touted for decades by the Sweden Democrats.
""We need a strict immigration policy, probably stricter than the one we have today, if we are to take care of the very large number of immigrants we already have. To me that is totally obvious,"" Kristersson said. 
The veteran pro-EU politician is also banking on promises of a crackdown on crime that many Swedes associate with immigrants to deflect the Sweden Democrats - without negotiations - but that strategy could backfire.
The Sweden Democrats have said they will act to bring down any government that does not listen to them, leaving Kristersson with a precarious path to winning and holding power. 
Prime Minister Stefan Lofven's Social Democrats have around 25 percent support in polls, ahead of the Moderates and Sweden Democrats, but neither his center-left bloc nor the rival Alliance look likely to garner a majority on Sept. 9.
Complex parliamentary arithmetic indicates Kristersson will succeed in ousting Lofven in a post-election vote by MPs, but he will have a tough task filling the Social Democrat's shoes.
If he is seen as yielding to the Sweden Democrats he may be ditched by the centrist and liberal parties in his Alliance. 
Should he fail, few options appear open to form a stable government. The Sweden Democrats' surge has transformed a political landscape long defined by clear-cut, sturdy center-left and center-right blocs in the Riksdag (parliament).
Indeed, snap elections could become reality for the first time in 60 years. 
""I won't form or continue to lead a government that gets nothing done,"" said Kristersson. ""So there are certainly such risks.""

Police in Northern Cyprus were questioning a suspect alleged to have taken delivery of narcotics from a drone which had taken off from the Greek Cypriot south of Cyprus's divided capital Nicosia, the Turkish Cypriot Kibris newspaper and Turkey's private DHA agency reported.
The reports did not disclose the type of drug that was seized. Turkish Cypriot police were not available for comment. Police on the Greek Cypriot side said they had no information about the incident, as did the United Nations force which monitors the frontier.
Cyprus has been divided between its ethnic Greek and Turkish Cypriot populations since a 1974 Turkish invasion split the country in the wake of a brief Greek inspired coup.
The north is a breakaway state which is recognized only by Turkey. The rest of Cyprus is ruled by a Greek Cypriot government which is a member of the EU and claims sovereignty of the whole island.
The heavily militarized 180 km (116 mile) frontier splitting Cyprus east to west runs straight through the center of Nicosia.

490,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2018 09:31AM ET</span>",Clashes shatter illusion of security in Libyan capital,"By Aidan Lewis and Ahmed Elumami
CAIRO/TRIPOLI (Reuters) - A bout of fighting in Libya's capital has laid bare the fragility of a militia cartel that had brought a veneer of stability to the city and encouraged the gradual return of foreign diplomats and plans for elections in December. 
Major battles have become rarer in Tripoli since last year as a handful of armed factions aligned with the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) consolidated their control. 
But the ascent of four or five ""super militias"" has created resentment among groups excluded from the capital and from access to the spoils of Libya's informal economy.
That has heightened the risk of conflict and made the challenge of disbanding militias or integrating them into regular security forces more complex, diplomats and analysts say. 
Bringing militias to heel is seen as crucial to resolving a conflict that has divided Libya since a NATO-backed uprising forced Muammar Gaddafi from power seven years ago, slashing oil production and giving space to migrant smugglers and militants. 
Fighting on Monday and Tuesday pitted the Seventh Brigade, or Kaniyat, from Tarhouna, a town 65 km (45 miles) southeast of Tripoli, against the Tripoli Revolutionaries' Brigades (TRB) and the Nawasi, two of the capital's largest militias. 
The Kaniyat and other groups from outside Tripoli have noticed the success of rivals inside the city with growing unease. Reports about the wealth, power and extravagant lifestyles of some Tripoli militia commanders have fueled resentment.
""The profits from state capture now go to a narrower set of armed groups than ever before,"" said Wolfram Lacher, a researcher at the German think-tank SWP.
""That's a very dangerous situation because it excludes powerful forces from access to levers of the state and administration, and this is now causing those forces to build alliances against the big militias in Tripoli.""
As they launched their incursion into Tripoli, Kaniyat denounced their rivals as the ""Daesh (Islamic State) of public money"", promising to ""cleanse"" them from the country.
HEAVY FIGHTING 
Kaniyat made gains as tanks, armored vehicles and pickup trucks mounted with anti-aircraft guns were deployed in densely populated residential areas of southern Tripoli, with explosions and heavy artillery fire echoing across the city.
At least five people were killed and nearly 30 wounded on the first day, officials said. 
Tripoli's big armed groups claim official status through the GNA - which is opposed by a rival government and military faction based in the east of the sprawling North African country - but act with autonomy.
They guard strategic buildings, control Tripoli airport and have infiltrated ministries and many of the banks, giving them access to coveted dollars at the official exchange rate, about five times cheaper than the parallel rate. 
""They place their people throughout the state administration, particularly in positions that offer control of economic resources,"" said Lacher. 
Since last summer an ex-prime minister, the mayor of Tripoli and the head of the state religious authority have been among a series of senior figures to be abducted then released by militias.
A key member of the GNA's leadership, Fathi al-Majbari, withdrew from his position after an armed group attacked his residence in June.
Earlier this month the National Oil Corporation denounced militia threats against the newly appointed head of its fuel distribution unit over efforts to tackle smuggling, and the sovereign wealth fund said that it had been forced by threats and abductions to move premises. 
Prominent Libyans based abroad have said they seek the protection of armed militia factions, not the government, when they travel to Tripoli. Diplomatic staff evacuated amid fighting in 2014 and now tentatively returning ultimately depend on armed groups for access and protection.
Critics of a French-led plan to hold national elections on Dec. 10 worry that a free vote will be impossible, and that militias will challenge with force any result they don't like.
""I think it's a race against time and I feel like the (Libyan) state's disappearing,"" said one senior diplomat. ""It's hard now to tell where's the state and where's the militia.""

491,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2018 09:31AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Cameroon cocoa exporters, farmers flee crisis in Anglophone region","By Ana Ionova and Josiane Kouagheu
LONDON/DOUALA, Cameroon (Reuters) - Cocoa firms operating in Cameroon have moved staff out of the Anglophone region of the country and farmers are abandoning their crops in the area, as violence between separatists and security forces intensifies, exporters and farmers told Reuters. 
Sources say the deepening conflict has started denting cocoa output and flow from the southwest, stripping the region of its mantle as Cameroon's top cocoa-growing area.
Telcar Cocoa, Olam and Theobroma are among the firms that have moved the majority of their staff out of southwest Cameroon due to safety concerns, according to several sources with knowledge of the matter. 
Some cocoa farmers have also abandoned their plantations and fled, driven out by a rise in kidnappings, extortion and fighting between insurgents and security forces. 
""Producers have fled into the bush and elsewhere, and can no longer take care of their plantations,"" said James Mosima, president of the union of southwest cocoa farmers. ""The situation is really very difficult.""
Cameroon has been gripped by violence since November 2016, when government forces crushed a movement of Anglophone teachers and lawyers protesting against their perceived marginalization by the country's French-speaking majority.
The protests morphed into an insurgency of separatists seeking independence for the Anglophone southwest and northwest regions, which were controlled by Britain during colonialism. 
The crisis has intensified ahead of elections in October, with the increasingly bloody clashes hitting cocoa trade in what was once the key cocoa region of Cameroon, the world's fifth-largest producer.
WORSENING VIOLENCE
In recent months, insurgents have abducted and killed soldiers while security forces responded by burning villages and opening fire on fleeing residents, according to witnesses. The army denies such accusations.
Sources say deteriorating security has made it increasingly difficult for cocoa buyers and exporters to operate in the area. At least one warehouse belonging to Telcar, the largest buyer in the region, was burned, according to several sources with knowledge of the matter.
The crisis has led major cocoa firms - including Telcar Cocoa, Theobroma and Olam - to relocate most of their staff from the region, according to sources.
Telcar Cocoa is a joint venture between Cargill and Cameroonian businesswoman Kate Kanyi Fotso Tometi. Theobroma is part of ECOM Group. 
The sources said Theobroma has relocated its staff some 150 km (95 miles) south, from the Mamfe region to Kumba. Olam, meanwhile, has moved staff out of Mamfe and Kumba to the economic capital, Douala, the sources said. 
Most international companies had small teams stationed in the region, they said, with one of the sources estimating 15-20 people were moved altogether. 
Cargill declined to comment. Olam and ECOM did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Cameroon's trade minister and Fotso also declined to answer questions about the crisis in the Anglophone regions.
Most international export firms now use local buying agents as intermediaries to source cocoa from the affected areas, exporters said. 
""At one point, if the effort or the risk is too much ... you leave it to the buying agents,"" one source at an international firm said. 
BULLETS AND EXTORTION
Some farmers also said they had fled, fearing violence and threats from separatists demanding payments to allow cocoa to move out of the southwest. 
Several cocoa farmers who had left that region told Reuters armed groups had been targeting ""rich men"" and demanding money to allow the flow of goods out of the area.
In June, Peter, 59, abandoned his cocoa farm and sought refuge in Douala with his wife and four children.
""Since (the) beginning of this year ... not a week has passed without an exchange of fire between army and separatist fighters,"" said Peter, who declined to give his last name for security reasons.
""I had three hectares of cocoa and I gave up everything. I could not stay because, apart from bullets, the separatists extorted money from us.""
As many as 200,000 people have fled the English-speaking regions since late last year, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
As farmers flee the southwest, sources say the conflict has started to hit cocoa output and flow. 
The southwest accounted for 45 percent of Cameroon's production in 2016/17, but its share dropped to 32 percent last season, according to CICC, the country's cocoa regulator.
Cameroon produced 253,510 tonnes of beans in the 2017-2018 season.
For a graphic, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2yVlmVV
The conflict has made it more difficult to move beans out of the Anglophone region and into the main port in Douala, the sources said. 
Cameroon's cocoa stocks built up to 21,159 tonnes in 2017-2018, from 7,212 tonnes in the prior season, according to the National Office of Cocoa and Coffee (ONCC).
""The vast majority of this stock is in the English-speaking region because the fighting paralyses everything,"" a source at the ONCC said.
However, trade sources said cocoa was still finding its way out of the southwest, as more beans were being smuggled into Nigeria instead. 
One trade source estimated that volumes flowing across the border rose to 30,000-40,000 tonnes last season, from about 10,000 in previous years. 
""At the end of the day, cocoa is money for the locals,"" the source said. ""It's like water - it always finds its way out.""

JALAZONE, West Bank (Reuters) - Schools run by the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees opened in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip on Wednesday after it secured funding to offset cuts by its main donor, the United States.
The beginning of the school year had been in doubt after the United Nations Relief and Works (UNRWA) said it lacked funds to pay the 22,000 teachers in its schools in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, East Jerusalem, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. 
""We're very determined to keep these schools open,"" Pierre Krahenbuhl, commissioner-general of the UNRWA, told reporters at a girls' school in the West Bank refugee camp of Jalazone as students in pinstripe uniforms turned out for callisthenics in the courtyard.
The United States earlier this year cut its aid to UNRWA to $60 million from a promised $350 million for the year, saying the agency needed to make unspecified reforms and calling on the Palestinians to renew peace talks with Israel.
Two weeks ago, Krahenbuhl said schools would open on schedule now that the agency had received $238 million in additional contributions since the beginning of the year.
At the Jalazone school, he said Qatar and the United Arab Emirates provided $50 million each and UNRWA hoped to receive another $50 million announced by Saudi Arabia, but at the moment the agency was still short of $200 million.
Krahenbuhl said UNRWA schools in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, would open early next week as planned.

UNRWA was founded in 1949 after the first Arab-Israel war, which led to 700,000 Palestinians being forced to leave their homes. It helps around 5 million Palestinian refugees, a figure that includes descendants of those displaced by the conflict.

LONDON (Reuters) - Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Wednesday cast doubt on the ability of European countries to save Iran's 2015 nuclear accord with world powers, now under threat following a U.S. withdrawal, and said Tehran might abandon the agreement.
Khamenei cautioned President Hassan Rouhani not to rely too much on European support as he came under increased pressure at home over his handling of the economy in the face of U.S. sanctions, with key ministers under attack by parliament.
Following U.S. President Donald Trump's exit from an international accord that would curb Iran's nuclear ambitions, European powers have been scrambling to ensure Iran continues to get the economic benefits needed to keep it in the nuclear deal.
But in his comments published on his official website Khamenei told Rouhani and his cabinet on Wednesday: ""There is no problem with negotiations and keeping contact with the Europeans, but you should give up hope on them over economic issues or the nuclear deal.""
""The nuclear deal is a means, not the goal, and if we come to this conclusion that it does not serve our national interests, we can abandon it,"" Khamenei was quoted as saying.
Khamenei set out a series of conditions in May for European powers if they wanted to keep Tehran in the deal. They included steps by European banks to safeguard trade with Tehran and guarantee Iranian oil sales.
Speaking at the same meeting on Wednesday, Khamenei said Tehran would not negotiate with ""indecent and confrontational"" U.S. officials to reach a new agreement on its nuclear program because Washington ""wants to boast they managed to bring Iran to the negotiation table"".
Khamenei told Rouhani and his cabinet to work ""day and night"" to solve the mounting economic problems which include the collapse of the rial currency and surging unemployment.
But at the same time he appeared to call on parliament not to press too much on Rouhani who has been severely grilled over economic performance. Officials should unite against U.S. pressure, he said, since publicizing differences would only make the nation more unhappy.
IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS 
Earlier on Wednesday, Iranian lawmakers launched impeachment proceedings against the education minister, adding to the pressure on Rouhani.
The move came only three days after lawmakers sacked the minister of economy and finance blaming him for the collapse of the plight of the rial and mounting unemployment. They had, weeks earlier, dismissed the labor minister.
Another motion, signed by 70 lawmakers, aims to impeach the minister of industry, mines and business.
Rouhani won two landslide elections on a platform of economic reform and opening Iran up to the outside world, and his pragmatic supporters have a majority in the parliament.
But his reputation and political influence have taken a sharp hit as his promised economic gains have failed to materialize and U.S. sanctions have begun to bite.
Washington has imposed sanctions on the acquisition of U.S. dollars by Iran and it will reimpose sanctions on Tehran's oil exports and banking sector in November.
Iran's official unemployment rate is 12 percent, with youth unemployment as high as 25 percent in a country where 60 percent of the 80 million population is under 30. The rial has lost more than two-thirds of its value in a year.
A group of 20 lawmakers signed a motion on Wednesday accusing Education Minister Mohammad Bathaei of failing to reform the education system and rejuvenate schools, state news agency IRNA reported.
That is enough votes to force Bathaei to come to parliament to answer questions on his record in the next 10 days. If lawmakers are unhappy with his answers, they can vote to impeach and sack him. 
Iran's parliament voted on Tuesday to reject Rouhani's explanations for economic hardship, a sign his pragmatic faction is losing sway to hardline rivals as new U.S. sanctions bite deeper.
The worst may yet lie ahead as senior U.S. officials have said they aim to reduce Iran's oil exports to zero after the new round of sanctions in November.
Iran has said if it cannot sell its oil due to U.S. pressure, then no other regional country will be allowed to do so either, threatening to block the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic artery linking the Gulf crude producers to the world.
A senior Iranian military official said on Wednesday if foreign forces in the Gulf do not follow international laws, they would face the Revolutionary Guards' firm response.

LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - An Islamist party in Pakistan called for the expulsion of the Dutch ambassador on Wednesday as it launched a protest against a far-right Dutch politician's plan for a cartoon competition featuring caricatures of the Muslim Prophet Mohammed. 
Several thousand activists gathered in the eastern city of Lahore for the demonstration organized by Tehreek-e-Labbaik, a party that amassed the fifth largest number of votes in a general election last month having campaigned as a defender of the laws and punishments for crimes of blasphemy.
Party leader Khadim Hussain Rizvi set out from Lahore's historic center at the head of a protest he aims to take through the towns of Punjab province to the capital Islamabad, where protesters will stage a sit-in to pressure Pakistan's new Prime Minister Imran Khan to cut diplomatic ties with the Netherlands.
""The Dutch ambassador should be immediately deported,"" Labbaik spokesman Ejaz Ashrafi told Reuters. ""We will only stop when the government meets this demand.""
Pakistan has already complained to the Dutch government about far-right parliamentarian Geert Wilders' plans for a cartoon contest that will upset and provoke Muslims.
Wilders intends to display the cartoons on the walls of his political party's room in parliament. He says he’s had ""hundreds"" of entries.
""The Foreign Office called the charge d'affaires of the Netherlands and issued him a Demarche' to record a protest,"" the Pakistani prime minister's office said in a statement on Wednesday.
The Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte said last week that the cartoon competition ""was not something I would do"" and his government was not associated with it. 
Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said he planned to take up the issue with the United Nations and several world leaders. 
""They don't understand how much they hurt us when they do such acts,"" Khan, a cricketer-turned-politician, said on Tuesday, a day after the upper house of parliament condemned the proposed cartoon competition.
Officials from the Punjab provincial government met with Labbaik leaders in Lahore in a vain attempt to persuade them to call off their protest.
""We told them to stop the protests because the Pakistan government is taking up the issue effectively,"" an official involved on the talks told Reuters, adding that Labbaik representatives insisted the protest would only end once the Dutch envoy was expelled. 
Last year, in a stand-off with the previous government, Labbaik shut down a main highway leading into Islamabad for nearly three weeks over a small change in wording to an electoral law changing a religious oath to a simple declaration. Labbaik said the change amounted to blasphemy. 
The ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz was forced to accept the resignation of law minister Zahid Hamid, who Labbaik held responsible for the change, after seven people were killed and nearly 200 wounded in a failed attempt by police to disperse protesters.

496,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2018 07:58AM ET</span>",'Ghetto President' shakes up Ugandan politics,"By Maggie Fick and Cecilie Kallestrup
NAIROBI(Reuters) - The arrest this month of a 35-year-old legislator who calls himself ""Ghetto President"" has sparked fierce street protests in Uganda. Musician-turned-MP Robert Kyagulanyi represents a new challenge to President Yoweri Museveni, in power since 1986.
Museveni has won praise in the West for his support against militant Islam and his role as power broker in the volatile Great Lakes Region. Uganda has also welcomed foreign investors such as France’s Total, China’s CNOOC and Britain’s Tullow as part of a plan to start pumping oil from 2021.
But the 74-year-old leader's move to sign a law scrapping a 75-year age limit has prompted many Ugandans to believe he wants to remain in power indefinitely. 
Opposition to him has been galvanized by Kyagulanyi, who according to his backers was beaten and tortured after he was arrested on Aug. 14 for his role in the stoning of Museveni’s convoy.
He was unable to stand without help when he appeared in a military court last week to face charges, subsequently dropped, of illegal weapons possession. He was then charged with treason in a civilian court before being granted bail. 
Though many Ugandans have long complained of worsening government services, rising crime and widespread corruption, there has not been a politician broadly popular enough - especially among the young - to challenge the status quo.
WHO IS ""BOBI WINE""?
""Bobi Wine"" is the stage name of Kyagulanyi, who entered politics last year with a landslide victory as an independent candidate in a parliamentary by-election. He was already well-known among young Ugandans for his songs about corruption, poor government services and poverty. 
""Why de price of electricity too high? Why de price of education is too high?"", Kyagulanyi crooned in one song. His music videos frequently portray the life of everyday Ugandans in neighborhoods with unpaved roads and poor infrastructure.
Kyagulanyi has become a leading critic of unpopular measures including a tax on social media used by many Ugandans. Despite having an active Twitter account himself, Museveni says social media is used to spread gossip and lies. 
HOW HAS THE GOVERNMENT RESPONDED?
Street protests against government policies have broken out repeatedly in recent years. Rights groups say Museveni has reacted with a mix of force and cash handouts. The government denies the use of heavy-handed tactics and says the country is a thriving multiparty democracy. 
Last week, during two days of anti-government demonstrations in the capital Kampala and other parts of the country over Kyagulanyi's detention, police said they arrested dozens of people in Kampala and fired tear gas to quell ""riots"". 
On Tuesday, soldiers involved in the alleged beating of Kyagulanyi, four other MPs and civilians who have been charged with treason, the army said. That came after the Parliament Speaker called for the arrest of security forces involved in the beatings in a letter to Museveni on Aug. 27.
IS HE A THREAT TO MUSEVENI'S GRIP ON POWER?
Nearly 80 percent of Uganda's population of 41 million people is under the age of 30, according to Youth Policy Labs, a Berlin-based think-tank. Though new to politics, Kyagulanyi has succeeded in mobilizing youth discontent. The #FreeBobiWine hashtag has become a rallying point on Twitter. 
This is something veteran opposition politicians such as Kizza Besigye, who at 62 years old is considered part of Museveni's generation, have failed to do so. Besigye has lost three consecutive, disputed presidential elections.
The energy behind Kyagulanyi comes in contrast to signs of declining support for Museveni, a former guerrilla fighter and one of Africa's longest-serving rulers. At an Independence Day party in his home region last year, uniformed security outnumbered a small crowd of bored spectators.
For now, the protests have abated. But independent Kampala-based analyst Anna Reuss said the movement around Kyagulanyi still had the potential to be a game-changer.

""What has happened over last two weeks has changed the country and changed the conversation,"" she said. ""It's lit a fire that even if it just keeps smoldering, the government can't fully put it out again.""

ABUJA/MAIDUGURI (Reuters) - Nigerian government officials have ordered thousands of displaced people to return to an unsafe area as pressure mounts to show progress in the war against Islamist groups ahead of a presidential election, according to sources familiar with the situation.
Those who have gone back say they only did so because the officials told them they would get no more aid if they remained in refugee camps. Returnees say their home area of Guzamala in the northeast is not safe and they cannot earn a living there.
At issue is the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari, a retired general who won power in 2015 on a promise to restore security to the northeast and end the Islamist Boko Haram insurgency, now in its tenth year.
Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2JmvnQA
Western diplomats and aid officials have expressed concern that sending displaced people back to their home regions is part of Buhari's political agenda, and that of the ruling party as local elections are also being held.
""Pushing these people back just to make a point when the security situation remains tenuous is a terrible idea,"" one diplomat told Reuters.
The government and the election commission have met to discuss how to expedite returns as the election early next year nears, according to a person with direct knowledge of those talks.
Officials have told people their home areas are safe and they can go back to their livelihoods. That is a tempting proposition for people who have lived in camps for years, dependent on handouts.
In June, government officials told some 2,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) living in Bakasi camp in the city of Maiduguri to go back to a town in the Guzamala region, according to interviews with returnees, a government official and others with knowledge of the matter.
""They said, 'If you refuse to return, you are on your own, the government will not help you anymore',"" said Hassan, who, like other returnees, asked to be identified by his first name for fear of reprisals.
Guzamala is viewed by the United Nations and aid organizations as inaccessible or hard to reach. They do not deliver aid to a region under the sway of Islamic State West Africa. ISWA split from Boko Haram in 2016 and is now the bigger threat in Nigeria's northeast, security experts believe.
Earlier this month, Islamist militants killed at least 19 people, and possibly as many as 63, in an attack on a village in Guzamala.
Foreign governments, which provide aid and military support in the northeast, successfully lobbied Nigerian officials to pause the returns to dangerous areas like Guzamala, though the program is expected to resume after an assessment, said four people familiar with the matter.
FORCED TO LEAVE
Four returnees who spoke with Reuters said government officials ordered them to Guzamala. Three said those officials threatened to cut off their aid if they refused - a threat that was carried out, so even those who wanted to stay had to leave.
Interviewees identified Sugun Mai Meleh, the commissioner of land and survey for Borno state, and Lawan Umara Zanna, the chairman for Guzamala, as the officials who made the threats. They said Borno State House of Assembly Speaker Abdulkarim Lawan was also present.
Borno is at the center of the fight against Boko Haram and ISWA. Maiduguri and Guzamala both lie within the state.
Lawan told Reuters that he was at the gathering returnees had described, but he was not aware of any forced returns and no threats were made. ""That is not true,"" he said. 
The Nigerian presidency, military and Mai Meleh did not respond to requests for comment. Zanna declined to comment.
Bashir Garga Idris, northeast Nigeria coordinator for the National Emergency Management Agency, said people were not being coerced to return, although he did not know about the reported threats because he was outside Nigeria at the time.
ELECTION PRESSURE
In meetings, the government has discussed how to return as many people as possible to their home regions in Borno in the run-up to the election, said a person with knowledge of those discussions.
Aid officials and Western diplomats also say the government's return program is geared towards elections.
The aim is to have as many people returned as possible so they can vote in primaries, which run from August to October, the person with knowledge of talks added. 
In Nigeria, people can only vote in regions where they are registered, potentially making hundreds of thousands of people displaced to Maiduguri ineligible unless special arrangements are made for them.
Mikah Lakumna, an official with the Independent National Electoral Commission in Borno, said that the government was trying to close some IDP camps, and INEC was exploring ways to ensure those people's voting rights.
INEC is assessing security to see how it can send election officials into dangerous areas, and is also looking into instances where voters had been coerced into returning to regions they were registered, Lakumna said.
""WE WERE DECEIVED""
The roughly 2,000 Guzamala returnees are part of more than 7.7 million people in Nigeria's northeast who need aid to survive in one of the world's biggest humanitarian crises.
When they reached Guzamala, they found a wasteland. 
Their town was in ruins. Many buildings were burned or collapsed, returnees told Reuters. There were so few houses that people took shelter in a school where rain had caved in the roof.
Pictures of the town, seen by Reuters, showed shattered structures and blackened streets littered with burnt-out debris.
There, some food and supplies - enough to feed a family of 10 for a day, according to one man - were distributed. Since then, the returnees have been left for weeks at a time to fend for themselves. Some soldiers took pity on them and handed over their own water rations.
""We were deceived,"" said Modu, a returnee. ""There is nothing in Guzamala other than suffering.""
Some in authority also had reservations.
""The place was not ready for the survival of people because there is no food, water is scarce,"" said a soldier in Guzamala, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""It is not only Guzamala that is in terrible state, but the whole of northern Borno - Boko Haram ruined the place and they are still there. Ordinarily, IDPs are not supposed to return now, but because our ogas (bosses) just want to make it look as if things are okay there.""
Officials had promised Guzamala's returnees they could farm, but there was nothing to farm, nor anything to farm with, the returnees said. Much of the suitable land lies in the bush, where ISWA roams.
""They forced us to return and they did not keep their promises,"" said Mohammed, another returnee.
Of those who went to Guzamala, dozens have tried to return to the relative safety of Maiduguri. The city is guarded, and aid agencies provide food, shelter and medicine.
""We expected the government to provide us with food, but nothing was done. It is better to return back to Maiduguri than to die of hunger,"" said Kadai, another Guzamala returnee. ""The government lied to us.""

In Maiduguri, returnees found government officials had denied them access to aid, according to two people familiar with the camp management. Left with no choice, they returned to Guzamala.

Indonesia, which usually limits abortion to cases of a medical emergency for the mother or the fetus, permits it in rape cases during the first 40 days of a pregnancy, while the penalty for illegal abortions is up to 10 years in jail.
""The girl has been acquitted of all charges,"" Hasoloan Sianturi, a spokesman for the high court in the province of Jambi, on the island of Sumatra, told Reuters.
""The judge decided on Monday that while she did have an abortion, the circumstances forced her to do so and she had been raped by her brother.""
But the girl's mother was still being investigated over whether she had helped her daughter to have the abortion, the spokesman added, although that case had not yet come to court.
The brother is serving a two-year sentence for assaulting a minor.
Women's rights groups had condemned the initial decision by a lower court, saying it reinforced an existing culture of blaming the victim, and rights group Amnesty International also called for her release.
Media said police launched an investigation after a fetus was found in an area with palm plantations.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's Supreme Court on Wednesday increased former tycoon Nochi Dankner's prison sentence to three years after rejecting his appeal against his conviction for securities fraud related to the IDB group he once controlled.
Dankner, 63, was found guilty in 2016 of manipulating his company's shares ahead of a planned stock issue and was sentenced by a Tel Aviv district court to two years behind bars. 
The Supreme Court rejected his appeal against the conviction and the sentence, and accepted a prosecution request for a heavier prison term, court documents showed.
He was ordered to report to jail on Oct. 2.
Dankner was once one of Israel’s most powerful and popular businessmen. He controlled the IDB holding company, and was widely credited with helping Israel's economy in the early 2000s during a Palestinian uprising.
But he lost his business empire in the global financial crisis that began in 2007. Dankner’s companies had included a major supermarket chain, cellphone operator, airline and one of the country’s main newspapers.
In February 2012, after things had turned sour for his business empire, Dankner created a false impression there was strong interest in the stock of his IDB conglomerate to help a share sale, when in reality there was not, the Tel Aviv court found in 2016.
IDB had a complex pyramid of control with multiple levels of holding firms and subsidiaries. It hit hard times when the market crashed and some investments, such as a major Las Vegas real estate deal, failed and the firm incurred a heavy debt.
Dankner’s case has led to economic reforms in Israel, with the government passing regulations to increase market competition and limit pyramid-style companies.
Control of IDB and its subsidiaries has since been sold to Argentinian businessman Eduardo Elsztain.

Dankner's co-defendant, Itay Strum, was ordered to serve two years in prison, double the original sentence.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya's high court on Wednesday temporarily halted criminal proceedings against the deputy Supreme Court justice who was arrested a day earlier and charged on suspicion of corruption, failure to pay taxes and improper dealings with a local bank. 
Judge Chacha Mwita said: ""I allow the application filed by deputy chief justice (Philomena Mwilu) seeking to stop proceedings in the lower court and I hereby grant a stay, meaning stopping the case.""
He said the case raised constitutional issues. ""The charges facing the deputy chief justice are over a commercial transaction between her and a private institution ... the court needs to determine whether that amounts to a criminal offence.""
Mwilu was charged on Tuesday evening, hours after being arrested, and released on a personal bond of 5 million Kenyan shillings ($49,640). 
Chief Public Prosecutor Noordin Mohamed Haji told a news conference on Tuesday that Mwilu had abused her office for personal gain, undermining public integrity in the judiciary. [L8N1VJ490]
He said he believed evidence against her was sufficient for ""a reasonable prospect of conviction"" and it was in the public interest for criminal proceedings to be brought. 
The government launched a new anti-graft push this year in East Africa's richest economy per capita led by Haji, a former deputy head of national intelligence, who has brought criminal charges against dozens of civil servants and business people.

The detention of the deputy chief justice is the highest profile case since a series of corruption-related arrests began several months ago.

YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar rejected on Wednesday a report by United Nations investigators that called for top generals to be prosecuted for genocide, saying the international community was making ""false allegations"".
The U.N. report marked the first time the organization has explicitly called for Myanmar officials to face genocide charges over a brutal crackdown on Rohingya Muslims last year.
""Our stance is clear and I want to say sharply that we don't accept any resolutions conducted by the Human Rights Council,"" the main government spokesman, Zaw Htay, said in an interview published in state media.
The fact-finding mission on Myanmar was established in March 2017 by the U.N. Human Rights Council.
Myanmar did not allow U.N investigators to enter the country, Zaw Htay said, adding: ""That's why we don't agree and accept any resolutions made by the Human Rights Council"".
He said the country has ""zero tolerance to any human rights violation"" and had set up a Commission of Enquiry to respond to ""false allegations"" made by the U.N. and ""other international communities"".
The government earlier this year set up a panel comprised of two Myanmar and two international members – Filipino diplomat Rosario Manalo and Kenzo Oshima, Japan's former ambassador to the U.N. - to investigate human rights abuses.
Myanmar has denied most of the allegations, saying the military responded to a legitimate threat from Rohingya militants, who attacked police posts across the western Rakhine state.
""If there is any case against human rights, just give us strong evidence, record and date so that we can take legal action against those who break the rules and regulations,"" Zaw Htay said.
Malaysia's foreign ministry said on Wednesday it was Myanmar's responsibility to take action against those to blame for the alleged genocide committed in Rakhine State.
Should Myanmar prove ""unwilling or incapable of ensuring justice"", the U.N. Security Council should step in and establish an international judicial mechanism to try the individuals most responsible for the crimes, the ministry said.
""Malaysia will continue to speak about the plight of the Rohingyas. We will also continue to call for international support for the Government of Bangladesh, in which close to a million Rohingyas have found refuge,"" Malaysian Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah said in the statement.
Around 700,000 Rohingya have fled the military crackdown in western state of Rakhine to neighboring Bangladesh, according to U.N. agencies. They joined nearly 200,000 Rohingya who had been already been living in camps there for years.
In the Bangladesh capital Dhaka, State Minister for Foreign Affairs Shahriar Alam told reporters the U.N. produced ""the most comprehensive, factual and crucial report since the attack in August last year"".
Alam said it was natural for Myanmar to reject the report, but he added: ""That does not matter. The world knows everything"".
On the same day that the U.N. released its report, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) shut down the account of army general Min Aung Hlaing and other top military officials, accusing them of using its platform to spread ""hate and misinformation"".
In the interview published on Wednesday, Zaw Htay said the government had not ordered the ban and was questioning Facebook about the action, saying it had caused ""mounting criticism and fear among the people"".

Myanmar's civilian government shares power with the military, which controls key ministries including home affairs and immigration.

FALLUJA, Iraq (Reuters) - At least eight people were killed and 12 wounded in a suicide car-bomb attack on a security checkpoint in western Iraq, the local mayor said on Wednesday.
The attacker drove a car rigged with explosives into the checkpoint in Qaim district, which was jointly manned by the army and Shi'ite militias, Mayor Ahmed al-Mehlawy told Reuters.
Five militiamen and three civilians were killed, Mehlawy said. Some of the wounded were in a critical condition, he said. The Iraqi military put the initial death toll at seven. 
""Security forces in the Qaim district noticed a suspect Kia vehicle and shot at it after it turned out to be rigged and driven by a suicidal terrorist, which led to its explosion and the death of seven people, including four from the security forces and three civilians,"" the military said in a statement.
Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack and said it killed 28 people, contradicting the official death tolls.
Iraq declared victory over Islamic State in December, dislodging the group from all the territory it held after its self-proclaimed caliphate, which also encompassed part of Syria, collapsed earlier in 2017.
Security forces retook Qaim, which lies 300 km (185 miles) west of Baghdad in the Sunni province of Anbar, on the border with Syria, in November. It was one of the last remaining territories in the country held by Islamic State.
The group's fighters have since then waged a campaign of kidnappings and killings.

Organizers of an arts festival whose theme this year is ""Bad News"" had installed the four-meter statue of Erdogan, with one arm outstretched, on a plinth in the central Square (NYSE:SQ) of German Unity in the western town of Wiesbaden on Monday.
But the statue got daubed with graffiti, including the slogan ""Turkish Hitler"", German media reported, and a few hundred residents had protested against it. 
Police said they could no longer guarantee people's safety so firemen used a large crane to take away the statue under the cover of darkness in the early hours of Wednesday.
Some three million people with Turkish roots live in Germany and Erdogan, who in June won re-election with expanded powers, is due to make a state visit to Berlin on September 28-29 as part of efforts to improve relations strained by years of disagreement on a range of issues.
Germany condemned Turkey's arrest of some 50,000 people and the suspension or firing of 150,000 others including teachers, judges and soldiers, after a failed coup against Erdogan in 2016. Berlin says the crackdown was excessive and harmed basic freedoms. Ankara says it acted to safeguard national security.
    ""It is certainly appropriate to conceive of Erdogan as a controversial figure, and one that we are allowed to discuss freely here in this country,"" the director of the biennial festival, Uwe Eric Laufenberg, told Reuters when the statue was erected on Monday. 
""We can have a discussion about this statue and this man.""
While some residents liked the statue, others objected.

""This is a man who has hundreds of people on his conscience... because he has lied and bought his way to power. He's a dictator,"" said resident Werner Starotsta.

506,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2018 05:57AM ET</span>","To counter China, West plans bigger footprint in Pacific: sources","By Colin Packham
SYDNEY (Reuters) - The United States, Australia, France and Britain will open new embassies in the Pacific, boost staffing levels, and engage with leaders of island nations more often in a bid to counter China's rising influence in the region, sources have told Reuters.
The battle for influence in the sparsely populated Pacific matters because each of the tiny island states has a vote at international forums like the United Nations, and they also control vast swathes of resource-rich ocean.
China has spent $1.3 billion on concessionary loans and gifts since 2011 to become the Pacific's second-largest donor after Australia, stoking concern in the West that several tiny nations could end up overburdened and in debt to Beijing.
In response, Australia, New Zealand and the United States say they will increase economic aid and expanding their diplomatic presence to countries in the region, government officials and diplomats told Reuters.
""We are concerned about Chinese practices that lead to unsustainable debt,"" said a U.S. government source with direct knowledge of Washington's plan for the region, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

The U.S. official said Washington needed to have adequate representation in the Pacific countries in order to let their governments know what options were open to them and the consequences of taking offers from elsewhere.
China's embassy in Australia did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Earlier this year, China's ambassador said Beijing was careful to ensure that borrowers were able to meet debt repayments.
Representatives for the governments of Australia, Britain, France and the United States in Canberra did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The U.S. government source said Washington would boost diplomatic staffing numbers in Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia and potentially Fiji within the next two years.
Australia's government is expected to name its first High Commissioner to Tuvalu within weeks, rushing to fill a post Canberra decided upon establishing only several months ago, a government source told Reuters. He declined to be identified as he is not authorized to talk to the media.
Britain will open new High Commissions in Vanuatu, Tonga and Samoa by the end of May 2019, while French President Emmanuel Macron is seeking to organize a meeting of Pacific leaders early next year, diplomatic and government sources have told Reuters.
Earlier this month, Tongan Prime Minister 'Akilisi Pōhiva sought support from other governments in the region to make a coordinated request for China to forgive mounting debts. The Pacific leader then abruptly backed down after Beijing complained about the plan. 
Palau and Tuvalu both recognize Taiwan, which is claimed by Beijing as a Chinese territory, and has become one of China's most sensitive issues.
NAVAL DIPLOMACY
China isn't only offering funds to build influence.
By the end of 2018, Fiji expects to receive a Chinese hydrographic vessel that can map the sea bed, Viliame Naupoto, the head of Fiji's armed forces told Reuters. It will be the first military gift from China to a Pacific nation, and Western diplomats saw it as an attempt by Beijing to find favor with Fiji, one of the region's larger economies. 
""Fiji has a strong economy on the back of a vibrant tourism sector, it will have plenty of finance options,"" said a former Australian diplomat.
The Western allies are also working on building relations. Forces from Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Tonga will next week join two weeks of military drills off Australia's northern coast, along with personnel from the United States, France and Japan. China is also attending at the invitation of host nation Australia.

""There is a sustained push by allies in the region. The Indo-Pacific is a large body of water; a strong navy makes for a strong national defense,"" Andrea Thompson, U.S. Under Secretary for International Security and Arms Control told Reuters.

The South China Morning Post, citing unidentified sources with ties to the Chinese military, said China was building the camp in the narrow Wakhan Corridor that links the two countries.
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying dismissed the report, however.
""After looking into it, the relevant report is not true,"" she told a daily news briefing.
""Since the construction and training, this situation, it doesn't exist - it's not true. So anything related naturally is not true,"" Hua added, dismissing the assertion about China eventually sending its own soldiers.
She did not elaborate. The Defence Ministry did not respond to a request from Reuters for comment.
It was not the first time reports have pointed to China seeking a military presence in Afghanistan, although it has denied all of them.
In January, the defense ministry denied a similar report that it planned to build a military base in Afghanistan.
It has also previously dismissed reports that Chinese military vehicles were patrolling in the south Asian nation.
China has long worried that instability in Afghanistan could spill over into its violence-prone Xinjiang region, home to the Muslim Uighur people. 
In recent years, hundreds of people have been killed in the far western region in unrest China blames on Islamist militants.
China has also worked with Pakistan and the United States to broker peace talks to end Afghanistan's Taliban insurgency that has raged since the militants were ousted by U.S.-backed forces in 2001.
Last year, China opened its first overseas military base, in the Horn of Africa country Djibouti. It has previously denied having plans for other overseas bases, but the United States expects it to build more, with Pakistan a likely location.

A Kenya Defence Forces statement did not say who it believed was responsible for the attack in coastal Lamu County although it referenced ""lurking terror elements"" in the region. 
On Aug. 8, five soldiers were killed in an attack claimed by the Somali group al Shaabab in Lamu, according to local officials. 
The al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab aims to topple Somalia's U.N.-backed government and impose its own strict interpretation of Islam. They have intensified attacks in Kenya since Nairobi sent troops into Somalia in 2011.
The group has launched several attacks, including ones in which they have beheaded people, in the past year in Lamu County. Kenyan security officials say the militants have used the Boni forest straddling the Kenya-Somalia border as a hideout and base for attacks.

The Justice Ministry added the group, Pacific Environment, to a list of banned organizations on Tuesday evening after prosecutors last week said it posed a threat to state security.
The San Francisco-based group, which could not immediately be reached for comment, campaigns with local partners to protect the environment in Siberia and the Far East from fossil fuel extraction, mining and illegal logging, according to its website.
Rights and other lobby groups that receive foreign funding have come under pressure in Russia since Putin signed into law legislation in 2015, banning ""undesirable"" organizations from operating in the country.

The Myanmar Fire Services Department dispatched a fire brigade to the Swar irrigation dam after it breached at 5:30 a.m. (2300 GMT), sending water into the nearby town of Swar and two villages.
""The (spillway) of the dam was broken and flooded the two villages close to the highway road,"" the fire department said on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page. 
""Over 5,400 people have moved to monasteries and safe areas in Yedashe township,"" said Chan Nyein Thu, staff officer at the regional department of disaster management.
More than 1,500 people were sheltering in unaffected Thagaya town, said an administrator there, Aung Hla Min.
Another 1,500 evacuees from at least four different villages near the dam were staying at a Buddhist monastery nearby, said Yedashe firefighter Kaung Myat Thiha.
Photos posted on Facebook showed Myanmar soldiers evacuating people on makeshift bamboo rafts and kayaks, and carrying children and the elderly through knee-deep floodwaters.
Mya Min, 67, told Reuters by phone at about 2pm that water had stopped flowing out of the breached dam.
""You can see there is only one-third of the normal amount of water left in the dam,"" he said.
Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay said there were no casualties reported as of early afternoon.
Authorities were working on ""relocation and prevention"" and using old roads to allow travel in the area, Zaw Htay said in a text message.
Fire officials closed a bridge on the Yangon-Mandalay highway bridge over the Swar creek. Pictures posted on the department's Facebook page showed water rushing within a few feet of the underside of the bridge.
“The water is not over the bridge but the flow under the bridge is very strong,"" said Min Min, a journalist based in Naypyitaw who was on the scene. 
The Myanmar army's commander in chief, Min Aung Hlaing, and Vice President Henry Van Thio were briefed on the incident by local officials, according to social media posts that showed them visiting the dam and the flooded area.
The dam was built across the Swar creek in 2004, can store 216,350 acre-feet of water and irrigates more than 20,000 acres of farmland, according to a Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation document posted online.
Myanmar's heavy annual monsoon rains have caused widespread flooding that displaced more than 100,000 people and killed at least 11 in July this year.
The Myanmar government is weighing a number of dam projects that would generate electricity to address chronic power shortages, but the projects are controversial due to their potential environmental impact.

A hydroelectric dam collapsed in neighbouring Laos last month, displacing thousands of people and killing at least 27, highlighting the safety concerns over many dams in Southeast Asia.

511,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2018 05:01AM ET</span>",Israeli court lines up behind unauthorized settlement,"By Jeffrey Heller
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - An Israeli court has given legal recognition to a Jewish settlement built without Israeli government authorization on privately owned Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank, breaking new judicial ground.
Israel's ultranationalist justice minister on Wednesday hailed the Jerusalem District Court's decision, announced late on Tuesday, relating to Mitzpe Kramim, an outpost established in 1999 near the Palestinian city of Ramallah and now home to 40 families.
Most countries consider all of the settlements built on land that Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war as illegal. Israel disputes this.
Mitzpe Kramim settlers had petitioned the district court in 2013 to recognize their claim to the land in the face of legal challenges by Palestinian property owners and their possible eviction.
The court declared the settlers the legal owners, finding that Israeli authorities were unaware the land was privately owned when they originally mapped out the area, in territory captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
It based its ruling on an Israeli law that states that even transactions with legal faults could be valid if they were conducted in ""good faith"".
Asked about the decision, Nabil Abu Rdainah, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said all of the settlements that Israel has built on occupied land are illegal.
""Peace can't be achieved as settlement continues,"" he said.
Israel's Peace Now organization, which monitors and opposes Jewish settlement on occupied land, said the outpost's fate would ultimately be up to the Supreme Court, where a petition by the Palestinian property owners is still pending.
The Supreme Court has consistently upheld Palestinian property rights in such cases, leading to the forced evacuation of some outposts.
""The (district court's) ruling ... is an important achievement for settlement in Judea and Samaria,"" Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked wrote on Twitter, using the Biblical names for the West Bank, an area Palestinians seek for a state.
Peace Now said the ""granting of property rights to criminals who settled in an illegal outpost ... without permits, on private Palestinian land is outrageous"".
It noted that Israel's right-wing government, which originally had opposed the settlers' land claim, later supported their position in what the organization called an attempt to implement a controversial law on unauthorized settlement.
The legislation, passed by parliament in 2017, enables the retroactive legalization of 4,000 settler homes built on privately-owned Palestinian land but is currently under review by the Supreme Court.
Some 500,000 Israelis live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, areas that are also home to more than 2.6 million Palestinians. Palestinians say settlements could deny them a viable and contiguous state.

TAMWORTH, Australia (Reuters) - In better times, the dam on farmer Kevin Tongue's property is three meters (yards) deep with water. It's now been empty for three months.
The worst drought in living memory is sweeping through Australia's east, the country's main food bowl, decimating wheat and barley crops and leaving grazing land parched.
Tongue, his wife and two sons hand-feed their 300 breeding cows and 1,300 sheep with grain and fodder bought and transported from other parts of the country as drought-hit local supplies run out.
""It's been a huge financial effect on everyone. Not just buying hay and things like that, but you know, we've got no winter crop and that's probably a third of our income that we won't have,"" Tongue told Reuters on his farm near the town of Tamworth about 300 kilometers (188 miles) inland from Sydney in the eastern state of New South Wales (NSW).
Forecasters have dramatically cut anticipated wheat yields for the country's most important crop three months before the harvest.
 Glencore  (LON:GLEN) Agriculture has forecast a wheat crop in NSW of just 2.4 million tonnes, less than a third of the average annual yield of 7.4 million tonnes.
Tongue said the despair in the farming community was palpable.
""When you have some strange woman come up crying on your shoulder, saying, 'I can't find hay, I can't find grain, what am I going to do?' I'm just not in a position to say I can help you but, yeah, it is very hard.""
The east coast has received some recent sporadic rain, though it has not been enough to save crops. A sustained break of the ""big dry"" is required to enable grazing to resume.
NSW is the country's most-populous state and produces a quarter of Australia's agriculture by value. The state government has officially declared a drought.
On 'Te-Angie', north-east of Tamworth, Richard Ogilvie said he had lost in excess of A$40,000 ($29,264) in income on his Hereford cattle station as grazing pastures turned to dust and feed costs soared.
This will lead to a loss of about A$200,000 ($146,320) longer term due to the reduction in breeding cattle, he said.
Many farmers, including Ogilvie, have been forced to shoot starving cattle, which he said was putting a big strain on the family.
""The ongoing thing is not to dwell and get down too much with the ongoing days of dragging cattle out of dams and shooting the ones that can't get up,"" he said.
Australia's federal government and the NSW state government have pledged several billions dollars in aid for drought-afflicted farmers.

Australia recorded its fifth-driest July on record last month. For NSW, the January-to-July period was the driest since 1965 and marked seven consecutive months of below-average rainfall for the state. ($1=1.3669 Australian dollars)

GENEVA (Reuters) - Nicaragua's government committed human rights violations and turned a blind eye while armed mobs rounded up protesters, some of whom were later raped with rifles and tortured in detention, the U.N. human rights office said in a report on Wednesday.
It documented human rights violations between April 18 and Aug. 18, including the disproportionate use of force and extrajudicial killings by the police, disappearances, widespread arbitrary detentions and instances of torture and sexual violence in detention centers.
""Repression and retaliation against demonstrators continue in Nicaragua as the world looks away,"" U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein said in a statement. 
The report said the U.N. Human Rights Council, which meets next month, should consider setting up an international inquiry or truth commission to prevent the situation getting worse, although ""the chilling effect of repression"" and a ""a climate of widespread terror"" had already silenced many of the protesters.
Detainees were tortured with Taser guns, barbed wire, beatings with fists and tubes and attempted strangulation, it said.
""Some women have been subject to sexual violence, including rape, and described threats of sexual abuse as common. Male detainees also mentioned cases of rape, including rape with rifles and other objects,"" the report said.
""SHOCK FORCES""
The violent crackdown on protests against President Daniel Ortega, a former Marxist guerrilla leader, have drawn international condemnation. The U.N. report said over 300 people had been killed and 2,000 injured.
After the protests began in April, people associated with the ruling Sandinista party were mobilized into ""shock forces"" or ""mobs"" to attack peaceful protesters, it said. 
""These mobs were holding cudgels, sticks and stones and wearing helmets,"" the report said.
The U.N. also had accounts of pro-government armed groups, trained by former gang members and retired soldiers, arresting protesters throughout the country.
""These armed elements are reportedly well trained and equipped with vehicles, military equipment and weapons, including with high caliber arms such as the AK-47 and Dragunov sniper rifles,"" it said.
Ortega said in a TV interview with Euronews on July 20 that the groups were “voluntary police” on “special missions,” and they operated undercover for security reasons, the report said. 
""OHCHR (the U.N. human right office) has gathered ample information (from confidential and open sources) that pro-Government groups acted with the acquiescence (and often in a joint and coordinated manner) of high-level State authorities and of the National Police, and that they act with total impunity,"" the report said. 
Some protesters had used weapons including rifles, but the U.N. found no evidence that they had coordinated or planned their violence. 

The U.N. said it had been in regular contact with Nicaragua's Ministry of Foreign Affairs but had faced obstacles to its work.

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - The arrest of five prominent human rights activists in raids across the country for suspected links to Maoist guerrillas ignited allegations on Wednesday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration was trying to intimidate its critics.
More than 20 civil rights groups, lawyers forums and trade unions are launching a campaign against Tuesday's crackdown, describing it as Modi's latest attempt to stifle dissent and shore up his standing in the run-up to elections in 2018.
Police also accused the five of inflammatory speeches at a rally in western India last year which led to violent clashes between Dalits, the lowest in the Hindu caste hierarchy, and right wing organizations. 
Laptops, mobile phones and even passwords were taken away during the raids at her home said trade union activist Sudha Bharadwaj who has been fighting for the rights of workers in parts of India such as Chhattisgarh where left-wing guerrilla groups operate.
""The effort is whatever is the opposition to this regime, whether it is workers rights, tribal rights, everybody who in the opposition is being rounded up,"" she told reporters outside her home in Faridabad, a short distance from New Delhi.
The arrests follow months of tensions between right wing nationalist groups and advocates of free speech that has played out in college campuses and spilled over into the streets. Critics also say several top journalists have been forced out of their jobs for their critical reporting of the government.
Police said they would be producing Bharadwaj and the four other activists arrested later on Wednesday. The others were Varavara Rao, a prominent poet from the southern city of Hyderabad, activists Vernon Gonsalves and Arun Ferreira from Mumbai and civil liberties activist Gautam Navlakha from New Delhi.
""The accused are booked under the unlawful activities prevention act,"" said a police officer in the western city of Pune. 
He said the main case relates to a rally held there on December 31, 2017 commemorating the valor of Dalits where provocative speeches were delivered. The following day, violent clashes broke out between members of the lower caste and hardline Hindu groups.
The police officer, who could not be named because he was not authorized to speak to reporters, said police had seized documents relating to the Maoist guerrillas who are leading an armed battle for the rights of the landless in large parts of eastern and southern India called the Red Corridor. 
Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the main opposition Congress party, said the latest raids showed that the government had little tolerance for activists, except for right wing groups that shared its hardline ideology.
""Shut down all other NGOs. Jail all activists and shoot those that complain. Welcome to the new India,"" he said in a Twitter post. Rights groups said they would be holding protest marches in New Delhi and Mumbai.

Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi will head the Pakistani delegation at 73rd U.N. General Assembly session set to open on September 18.
""No, the prime minister is not going. I will lead Pakistani delegation,"" Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi told reporters on Tuesday evening.
There was a debate in Pakistan whether the new prime minister would attend the U.N. session or stay home as part of his austerity drive and focus on economic issues.
""The prime minister of Pakistan thinks that the present situation in country needs attention,"" Qureshi told the media.
He said Khan wants to focus on his new government, sworn in earlier this month, and a looming currency crisis which threatens to derail the fast-growing economy.
Pakistan’s economy expanded at 5.8 percent in the last fiscal year, its quickest pace in 13 years, but the rupee currency has been devalued four times since December. Interest rates have been raised three times.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's revolving door of political leadership has hit confidence in sectors particularly prone to policy uncertainty, such as energy, which could hurt business investment and push back the timeframe for a central bank interest rate hike.
The resource-rich economy has seen five changes of prime minister over the past decade with Malcolm Turnbull last week becoming the latest to lose the top job amid political upheaval.
Growth has mostly remained unscathed - Australia has posted 27 years of uninterrupted expansion - but 10 years of political deadlock over climate and clean energy policies, among others, have created headaches for pockets of the economy.
Divall's Earthmoving and Bulk Haulage, which employs 250 people, has drawn business from wind farm developments northeast of the capital city Canberra but is considering scaling down operations due to political risks.
""Because of the policy failure in Canberra, some of the wind farms we work for are now sitting on the fence and that is hurting us,"" Andrew Divall, the firm's founder, told Reuters.
He is particularly nervous about policy direction under new Energy Minister Angus Taylor, who has long campaigned against wind farms and earlier this month called the obsession with emissions ""a massive mistake.""
Climate and energy politics have long been problematic for Australia's leaders.
Turnbull, whose views on climate change put him at odds with skeptics in his own Liberal party, last week was forced to water down a long-awaited energy policy in a failed bid to stave off a challenge to his leadership.
Several Liberal party members, including former Treasurer Joe Hockey and ex-Prime Minister Tony Abbott have in the past publicly bemoaned wind farm aesthetics, calling them ""appalling"","" ugly"", ""noisy"" or ""visually awful.""
Neither of them have supported other forms of renewable energy either. Turnbull cited such ""bitterly entrenched views"" in his farewell speech last week as a reason for the political deadlock.
Research group BIS Oxford estimates electricity engineering works to slump more than 27 percent to A$8 billion over the next five years with fewer projects in the pipeline and as the ""current energy policy failures deter new investment.""
Also weighing on confidence is the prospect of a federal election, which needs to be held by May next year and could effect yet another change of prime minister with the opposition Labor party currently ahead in the polls.
Amid the policy limbo and risks already hitting the housing market, some economists expect the central bank to keep rates at a record low 1.50 percent beyond 2020 to help support the A$1.8 trillion economy.
Westpac chief economist Bill Evans last week cited the political environment as one of the reasons for the Reserve Bank of Australia to stay pat until the end of 2020, as it revised its forecasts.
Evans expects the uncertainty to weigh on business confidence, spending and employment plans which in-turn would hurt an already cautious consumer. 
""DISAPPOINTING AND HUGELY FRUSTRATING""
The absence of a stable carbon policy over the past decade has resulted in underinvestment in energy generation, which has led to soaring power prices. That has, in-turn, hurt energy-intensive manufacturers such as aluminum, steel and packaging makers.
Alinta Energy, now owned by Hong Kong's Chow Tai Fook Enterprises, was forced in 2016 to shut a coal-fired plant in South Australia because it had become unprofitable.
Building products maker Brickworks has repeatedly said soaring energy prices were piling on cost pressures and stifling business investment, while gas pipeline company APA last week lambasted politicians for causing the instability in Canberra.
""It's disappointing and hugely frustrating for me to see our elected leaders putting their election agendas ahead of the best interests of the country,"" APA Managing Director Mick McCormack told Reuters in an interview.
CONTINENT OF INSTABILITY
Australia has not had a prime minister complete a full three-year term since 2007, a stark comparison to some less developed economies in the region.
Ironically, Papua New Guinea, once considered a part of the politically volatile chain of island nations to Australia's north known as the ""arc of instability"", has had the same prime minister since 2011.
Oil Search boss Peter Botten expressed relief that most of the company's oil and gas operations were in Papua New Guinea, not Australia.

""I'm actually glad that I work primarily in Papua New Guinea, where the fiscal regime and policy settings seem to be substantially more stable on key areas of energy development than in Australia,"" Botten told reporters.

The decision by the court, known as the TSE, increases the likelihood that its judges will declare Lula ineligible to run due to his corruption conviction that was upheld by an appeals court earlier this year.
Lula is leading in the poll by a long stretch but the TSE is expected to disqualify him before Sept. 17, the deadline for parties to alter their tickets.
His running mate Fernando Haddad, a former mayor of Sao Paulo who is slated to head the Workers Party ticket when Lula is barred, has been campaigning but cannot take part in the presidential debates.
Voter support for Haddad remains in the single digits and his chances will depend on Lula's ability to transfer support to his stand-in, who is hardly known in many parts of the country.
Lula was jailed in April to begin serving a 12-year sentence for receiving bribes but he continues to pull the strings in Brazilian politics from a 160-square-foot room at the federal police building in the southern city of Curitiba where he has no cellphone, cable TV or Internet connection.
The TSE voted 6-1 to reject Lula's appeal against the networks, which have ignored the leftist leader because he is in jail. Lula argued that he remains an official candidate until the TSE rules on whether he is eligible to run for office.

Brazil's Supreme Court will weigh an appeal by Lula to be set free so he can join the campaign that is already underway.

520,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2018 10:32PM ET</span>",U.S. military says no plans to suspend more major exercises on Korean peninsula,"By Phil Stewart and Arshad Mohammed
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. military has no plans yet to suspend any more major military exercises with South Korea, the defense secretary said on Tuesday, in the middle of a breakdown in diplomacy with North Korea over its nuclear weapons.
Defense Secretary James Mattis told a Pentagon news conference that no decisions had been made about major exercises for next year but noted that the suspension of drills this summer as a good-faith gesture to North Korea was not open-ended.
U.S. President Donald Trump's June decision to unilaterally suspend the drills caught many American military planners off guard and was broadly criticized as a premature concession to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who Trump wants to give up his nuclear weapons.
""We took the step to suspend several of the largest exercises as a good-faith measure coming out of the Singapore summit,"" Mattis told reporters, referring to the June 12 meeting between Trump and Kim.
""We have no plans at this time to suspend any more exercises,"" he said, adding that no decisions had yet been made on major exercises for next year. 
Mattis also said smaller exercises deemed to be exempt from the suspension were ongoing. 
Mattis' comments on the drills come at a delicate time for negotiations between the United States and North Korea after Trump scrapped plans for a meeting between top officials from both countries.
At the June summit, the first meeting between a serving U.S. president and a North Korean leader, Kim agreed in broad terms to work toward denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. But North Korea has given no indication it is willing to give up its weapons unilaterally as the Trump administration has demanded. 
Since then, diplomats have failed to advance the process. 
North Korean officials even warned in a letter to U.S Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last week that denuclearization talks risked falling apart, U.S. officials told Reuters. 
In particular, the North wants steps toward a peace treaty. The 1950-1953 Korean War ended in an armistice rather than a peace treaty, leaving U.S.-led U.N. forces technically still at war with North Korea.
U.S. officials fear North Korea might turn its attention to cutting a separate deal with South Korea and driving a wedge between the U.S.-South Korea alliance.
STALEMATE
A South Korea presidential spokesman acknowledged that talks between Washington and Pyongyang were at a stalemate.
""With North Korea and the U.S. remaining stalemated, there is an even bigger need for an inter-Korea summit,"" Kim Eui-kyeom, a spokesman for the presidential Blue House, told a briefing.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in said this month his planned third summit with North Korea's Kim next month would be another step toward the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and an end to the Korean War.
""Secretary Mattis' comment appears to be an extension of the previous U.S.-South Korea agreement concerning the postponement of joint drills, and there has been no other agreement,"" South Korea's foreign ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.
Trump abruptly canceled his top diplomat’s planned trip to North Korea on Friday, publicly acknowledging for the first time that his effort to get Pyongyang to denuclearize had stalled since his summit with the North's leader.
Trump partly blamed China for the lack of progress with North Korea and suggested that talks with Pyongyang, led so far by Pompeo, could be on hold until after Washington resolved its bitter trade dispute with Beijing.
North Korea's state media accused the United States of ""double-dealing"" and ""hatching a criminal plot"" on Sunday but did not mention Pompeo's canceled visit.
U.S. intelligence and defense officials have repeatedly expressed doubts about North Korea's willingness to give up its nuclear weapons and they had not expected Pompeo's trip to yield positive results. 
Mattis declined to comment on the broader diplomatic efforts, deferring to Pompeo's State Department. 
""We will work very closely, as I said, with the secretary of state and what he needs done we will certainly do to reinforce his effort. But at this time, there is no discussion about further suspensions,"" Mattis said.
The traditional U.S. calendar for other major drills does not pick up again until next spring, officials say, which could give diplomats and military planners time. 
The U.S.-South Korean exercise calendar hits a high point every spring with the Foal Eagle and Max Thunder drills, which take months to plan. 
One U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said preliminary planning for next year's drills was already taking place. Still, the official acknowledged that would not be indicative of whether the drills will go forward.
Max Thunder's air combat exercises so unnerved North Korea this year that it issued threatening statements that nearly scuttled the June summit between Trump and Kim. 

Foal Eagle is designed to simulate war scenarios and involves ground, air, naval and special operations forces.

In Brazil, where residents rioted and attacked Venezuelan immigrants in a border town earlier this month, President Michel Temer signed a decree to deploy the armed forces to the border state of Roraima. He said the move was aimed at keeping order and ensuring the safety of immigrants.
Peru, meanwhile, declared a 60-day health emergency in two provinces on its northern border, citing ""imminent danger"" to health and sanitation. The decree, published in the government's official gazette, did not give more details on the risks, but health authorities have previously expressed concerns about the spread of diseases such as measles and malaria from migrants.
The exodus of Venezuelans to other South American countries is building toward a ""crisis moment"" comparable to events involving refugees in the Mediterranean, the United Nations said this week.
Temer blamed the socialist Venezuelan government of President Nicolas Maduro for the migration crisis.
""The problem of Venezuela is no longer one of internal politics. It is a threat to the harmony of the whole continent,"" Temer said in a televised address.
Top immigration officials from Peru, Colombia and Brazil met in Colombian capital Bogota for a summit to discuss how to cope with the influx.
There are close to 1 million Venezuelans now living in Colombia and more than 400,000 in Peru, the countries said in a joint statement after the meeting on Tuesday. Just 178,000 of those in Peru have legal permission to stay or are being processed.
In an attempt to track arrivals and distribute aid, Colombia and Peru said they would share information about migrants in a database.
Maduro has warned migrants they face difficult conditions abroad and invited them to return home. On Tuesday, Venezuela said it had repatriated 89 citizens who had migrated to Peru but sought to return after suffering ""cruel treatment.""
""They listened to the siren call from abroad ... and all they found in Lima was racism, disdain, and persecution,"" Maduro told a news conference. 
He said Venezuelans should stop leaving the country to clean toilets and return to the ""country of opportunity.""
Oscar Perez, an activist who works with Venezuelan migrants in Peru, said the repatriation was a publicity stunt by the Venezuelan government.
An official at Peru's Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the repatriation, saying the country was focused on regional solutions to address the situation.
This month, Peru and Ecuador began requiring passports instead of national ID cards from Venezuelan migrants. Peru has also tightened deadlines for Venezuelans to sign up for a temporary residency card that lets them work in the country legally.
On Saturday, the first day Peru imposed its passport rule, the number of Venezuelan migrants entering the country fell by more than half to 1,630, according to Peru's immigration agency. But hundreds more without passports entered the country by seeking asylum.
Foreign ministers from Ecuador and Colombia, and possibly Peru and Brazil, will meet to discuss Venezuelan migration in Ecuador next week, said Christian Kruger, the head of Colombia's migration agency.

AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - A Texas jury on Tuesday found a white former policeman guilty of murder for fatally shooting a black teenager in a car moving away from him in a 2017 case in a Dallas suburb that fueled a national debate over possible racial bias in U.S. policing.
The police officer, Roy Oliver, 38, was fired by the Balch Springs Police Department for violating department policy a few days after he fatally shot Jordan Edwards, 15, a standout high school student and athlete. Edwards was shot in the head.
The conviction was a rare instance in which an officer was found guilty of murdering an unarmed person. 
The sentencing phase of the trial started shortly after the verdict came out and the same jury that convicted Oliver will decide on his punishment. He faces up to life in prison.
Oliver, along with another officer, had responded to reports of underage drinking at a house party in the predominantly black and Hispanic city of Balch Springs, about 15 miles (25 km) southeast of Dallas. Oliver fired his rifle five times at a car with several other teens inside, prosecutors said.
The jurors deliberated for about 12 hours over two days before reaching its verdict, following a trial that started in mid-August.
First Assistant District Attorney Michael Snipes said Oliver was a trigger-happy policeman who sent the teenager to an early grave.
""This guy is an angry, out-of-control, walking bomb,"" Snipes said in closing arguments. 
After the verdict came out, Odell Edwards, the father of the victim, told media: ""It's been a long time. It's been a hard year. I'm just really happy.""
The arrest warrant for Oliver said he and the other officer tried to stop a car at an intersection near the party. The other officer broke a passenger window with the butt of his gun.
Police body camera images showed to jurors indicated that the car was pointed away from the officers and was moving away from Oliver when he fired at it.
Oliver's defense attorney, Jim Lane, said the vehicle was a threat to Oliver's partner that night and he reacted to save his partner by firing into the car.
""Roy Oliver reasonably made the decision that he had to make,"" Lane said in closing arguments.

Two of Edwards' brothers were in the car with him and watched him die, a family lawyer said.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California will become the first U.S. state to eliminate the cash bail system for people awaiting criminal trial, under a reform bill signed on Tuesday by Governor Jerry Brown that will take effect in October 2019.
""Today, California reforms its bail system so that rich and poor alike are treated fairly,"" Brown, a Democrat, said in a statement.
The law will allow for defendants to be released after being arrested if they are deemed likely to appear for court hearings and pose little danger to the public. Judges would be allowed to rule out release for people accused of felony acts of violence, misdemeanor domestic violence, sexual assault, making threats and certain other crimes.
Civil liberties and human rights groups have long called for reforming the bail system, which has its roots in medieval England, but some of them opposed the California bill.
""It cannot guarantee a substantial reduction in the number of Californians detained while awaiting trial, nor does it sufficiently address racial bias in pretrial decision making,"" leaders of three American Civil Liberties Union chapters in California said in a joint statement. 
Local court systems in California would be allowed to set their own standards for releasing people considered a medium risk of endangering the public or not appearing in court. 
In U.S. states, defendants are released if they can arrange payment of a cash bond, which a court can hold until the legal case is concluded. Judges may determine a defendant is ineligible for bail, such as in some murder cases where public safety might be at risk. 
Federal courts in the United States rarely require defendants to post cash bail. Instead, judges can set conditions for release, such as supervision and travel restrictions.
California Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye supported the new bill.

""Our old system of money bail was outdated, unsafe, and unfair,"" Cantil-Sakauye said in a statement.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Findings of a U.S. State Department investigation into Myanmar's Rohingya crisis are ""consistent"" with those of a report by U.N. investigators released this week that called for Myanmar's commander-in-chief and other generals be tried for genocide, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said on Tuesday.
Addressing the U.N. Security Council, Nikki Haley said ""the world can no longer avoid the difficult truth of what happened."" She did not use the term ""genocide"" and the State Department has said it had not yet concluded whether it shared the determination of ""genocidal intent"" that Monday's U.N. report attached to the attacks on Rohingya Muslims.
However, Haley said that of the more than 1,000 randomly selected Rohingya Muslims surveyed in the State Department's own report, ""fully one fifth"" witnessed more than 100 victims being killed or injured. She said 82 percent had seen a killing, more than half had witnessed sexual violence and 45 percent had witnessed a rape.
""The report identifies one group as the perpetrator of the overwhelming majority of these crimes: the Burmese military and security forces,"" Haley said, referring to the U.S. report.
She said the Security Council must hold those responsible for the violence to account and added, ""The whole world is watching what we do next and if we will act.""
Haley's comments provided the first details of the State Department report compiled from 1,024 interviews at refugee camps in Bangladesh and completed in late April.
It remained unclear when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo planned to issue the full U.S. report, which could have legal implications of committing Washington to stronger punitive measures against Myanmar, particularly if Washington concluded there was genocide.
The findings were originally due to be announced ahead of Monday’s U.N. report but have been held up by internal deliberations.
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said ""genocidal intent"" was ""a very specific legal designation."" 
""It is not one that is easily made,"" she told a regular news briefing on Tuesday.
Critics have accused Washington of an overly cautious response to the Rohingya crisis, but a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Monday that the U.N. findings could increase pressure for tougher U.S. action.
The release of Monday's U.N. report marked the first explicit U.N. call for Myanmar officials to face genocide charges over their campaign against the Rohingya. It said the military carried out mass killings and gang rapes with ""genocidal intent"" and the commander-in-chief and five generals should be prosecuted.
LIMITED SANCTIONS
Washington, which had previously imposed sanctions on only one regional general over the crisis, targeted four more military and police commanders and two army units this month, but Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing was again spared.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the U.N. meeting that the U.N. report deserved serious consideration and that accountability was essential for genuine reconciliation between ethnic groups in Myanmar.
Also without using the word genocide, Guterres said the report by the independent U.N. experts found “'patterns of gross human rights violations and abuses' committed by the security forces, which it said 'undoubtedly amount to the gravest crimes under international law.'""
He said international cooperation would be ""critical"" to ensuring accountability.
Myanmar's ambassador to the United Nations, Hau Do Suan, repeated his government's contention that the Myanmar military had carried out a ""logical response"" to Muslim militant attacks. He said action would be taken against anyone responsible for human rights violations if there was sufficient evidence.
Guterres said the U.N. Security Council needed to continue to press for the release of journalists arrested for reporting on the Rohingya crisis, a reference to two Reuters reporters on trial in Myanmar.
Haley said the United States expected to see the two, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, acquitted of all charges.
Also on Tuesday, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Myanmar's civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who Washington has championed as a voice of democratic change, could not be blamed for atrocities as she did not have the powers necessary to stop military actions.
Haley made no mention of Suu Kyi, who the U.N. investigators said had failed to use her ""moral authority"" to protect civilians.
China, which has been vying with Washington for influence in Myanmar, said on Tuesday that ""unilateral criticism or exerting pressure"" was not helpful in resolving the Rohingya issue.
Some 700,000 Rohingya have fled the crackdown in Myanmar and most are living in refugee camps in neighboring Bangladesh.
Guterres said an international humanitarian appeal for the refugees remained significantly underfunded at 33 percent and more must be done to alleviate the threats to life from the current and impending monsoons.
He said it was clear conditions did not yet exist for the safe return of the Rohingya and called on Security Council members to join him in urging Myanmar to cooperate to ensure access to U.N. agencies and partners.

""There can be no excuse for delaying the search for dignified solutions that will allow people to return to their areas of origin in safety and dignity, in line with international standards and human rights,"" Guterres said.

526,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2018 05:51PM ET</span>","Vatican knew of Pennsylvania sex abuse cover-up, prosecutor says","(Reuters) - The Vatican knew of a cover-up of child sex abuse by Roman Catholic priests in Pennsylvania through secret archives that bishops in the state shared with church leaders in Rome, the state's attorney general Josh Shapiro said on Tuesday.
Though Catholic Bishops in Pennsylvania systematically denied the sexual abuse of thousands of children over a 70-year period, they secretly documented the cases and often sent information on them to the Vatican, Shapiro told two national news shows.
Shapiro first made the allegations against the Vatican during an Aug. 14 news conference to unveil a report on a two-year investigation into how Catholic clergymen in the state allegedly groomed and sexually abused children.
It was largely based on documents from the archives kept by the state's six dioceses, he said.
""There are specific examples where when the abuse occurred, the priests would go, the bishops would go and lie to parishioners, lie to law enforcement, lie to the public, but then document all the abuse in secret archives that they would share oftentimes with the Vatican,"" Shapiro told the CBS This Morning show.
""There are specific examples where the Vatican knew of this abuse and they were involved in the cover-up,"" Shapiro said.
Shapiro did not comment on whether Pope Francis or his predecessors knew of the information.
The national review board of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), in a statement issued on Tuesday on social media, said the report showed the “culture of silence” around sexual abuse of minors reached to the “highest level of the hierarchy” of the Catholic Church, demanding change, specifically among bishops.
""Holding bishops accountable will require an independent review into the actions of the bishop when an allegation comes to light,"" said the board, which was set up in 2002 to advise the USCCB on preventing sexual abuse of children in the Church.
Vatican press office director Greg Burke did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Shapiro's allegations. 
The attorney general said the Aug. 14 report was the most comprehensive on Catholic clergy sex abuse in American history, nearly two decades after an expose of widespread abuse and cover-up in Boston that rocked the Roman Catholic church.

In recent months, Pope Francis accepted a number of resignations from Chilean bishops in a sex abuse scandal that has rocked that country.

Mahmoud Alavi did not say when the arrests took place or which countries the spies allegedly were working for, but indicated that many of the detainees were dual nationals.
""I have repeatedly asked people to inform us if they know any dual national. The intelligence ministry's anti-espionage unit has successfully identified and arrested tens of spies in different governmental bodies,"" Alavi was quoted as saying by the semi-official news agency ISNA on Tuesday.
The arrest of dual nationals has increased since Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said there had been ""infiltration"" of Western agents in Iranian decision-making bodies.
Reuters reported in 2017 that Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards had arrested at least 30 dual nationals in recent years, mostly on espionage charges.
Tension between Tehran and some Western countries has risen since May when U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from an international nuclear deal with Tehran and reimposed some of the U.S. sanctions that had been lifted after the 2015 accord in return for restrictions on the Iranian nuclear program.
Iran does not recognize dual nationality and does not routinely announce arrests or charges of dual nationals, whose rights to consular assistance are enshrined in the U.N. Vienna Convention.
Alavi also said that security forces arrested this month a member of the Islamic State militant group in southern Iran, and had disbanded a ""terrorist cell"" in the country's north.
He said the intelligence ministry had foiled several bombing plots in metro stations and universities, but did not make any of this public at the time.
Under Islamic State’s ultra-hardline Sunni Muslim ideology, Shi’ites - the majority in Iran - are considered apostates. Last year, Islamic State militants carried out attacks on the parliament in Tehran and the mausoleum of the founder of Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. At least 18 people were killee in the attacks.

MILAN (Reuters) - Italy and Hungary, two fierce critics of European immigration policy, vowed on Tuesday to work together to pursue a new hardline approach to migrants searching for a new life inside the European Union.
Italian Deputy Prime Matteo Salvini, who has ordered ports closed to most migrant arrivals by sea, and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose government built a border wall, cemented their political ties in talks in Milan.
""We agreed that the most important issue is migration,"" Orban said, adding that they had agreed to jointly pursue their anti-immigration agenda as the European Union enters campaign mode for EU parliamentary elections in May next year.
He said Hungary had shown immigration could be halted across land borders and that Salvini's new Italian government had shown that it could also be stopped in the Mediterranean Sea.
""Europe's security hinges on his success,"" Orban said.
Italy and Hungary are both members of the European Union, which has drawn big numbers of asylum-seekers and poor migrants since 2015, most fleeing the Middle East and Africa.
Hungary was in the path of those fleeing the Syrian war, while those leaving Africa continue to head for Italy. Rome says it will not reopen its ports until its big EU neighbors agree to share the burden of taking in migrants rescued at sea.
Salvini and Orban said they agreed to work together ahead of European elections, though they belong to different factions. Salvini's right-wing League is allied to France's National Front while Orban is part of the center-right European People's Party.
Both criticized French President Emmanuel Macron. Salvini accused him of not doing enough to help Italy on migration and Orban said the French president wanted to ""blow up"" the EPP.
""Macron is the leader of pro-migration parties in Europe today,"" said Orban, whose visit prompted a protest in Milan by several thousand opponents of hardline immigration policies.
""And here we are, the ones who want to stop illegal migration. There is a big debate about this in the EPP as well. We would like our stance to be the general stance in the EPP.""
Salvini urged Macron to stop turning back migrants who try to enter France at the Ventimiglia border crossing with Italy.

However, Salvini said Italy was close to an agreement with Germany on migrant border controls.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq will send a delegation to the United States seeking an agreement on financial transactions with Iran following Washington's reimposition of sanctions on Tehran, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said on Tuesday.
His statement was the first by an Iraqi official since Reuters reported last week Baghdad was going to ask Washington for exemptions from some of the sanctions because Iraq's economy is closely linked with neighboring Iran.
""We have requests for the American side, we have presented them and a delegation will go to negotiate within that framework,"" Abadi told a weekly news conference.
""We have presented a clear vision of what Iraq really needs. This includes Iranian (natural) gas, which is very important, as well as other trade and the electricity sector.""
U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States in May from world powers' 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, calling it flawed, and reimposed trade sanctions on the Islamic Republic.
The Trump administration has warned of consequences for countries including European allies that co-signed the nuclear accord, that do not respect the new sanctions. Baghdad is in a difficult position - its two biggest allies are the United States and Iran, themselves arch-adversaries.
""We have had good promises initially but as you know the American situation is complicated; you do not deal with one person, there are several institutions,"" Abadi said.
He called the sanctions ""unilateral"" and ""oppressive"", adding that Iraq would not be ""part of a blockade"" due to its own painful experience with international sanctions during the era of Saddam Hussein.

Iraqi government and central bank officials said the delegation would travel to Washington to ask for exemptions in applying the sanctions. They did not say when that trip would take place.

Earlier on Tuesday the pro-Hezbollah Lebanese newspaper al-Akhbar reported that the U.S. delegation had held a four-hour meeting with security chief Ali Mamlouk near Damascus international airport. 
Asked about the reports, two senior U.S. intelligence officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was an ""ongoing dialogue with members of the Assad regime"" about driving Islamic State from Syria, Damascus' stockpile and use of chemical weapons, including chlorine, and the fate of journalist Austin Tice, who officials believe Damascus or its allies are holding.
The Syrian government could not be reached for comment.
Al-Akhbar reported that the U.S. officials had demanded the withdrawal of Iranian forces from southern Syria and data on ""terrorist groups"", including foreign fighters, and had also requested a role in the oil business in eastern Syria. 
Mamlouk said Damascus would not cooperate with Washington on security issues until they had normalized ties and he also demanded a complete withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria, al-Akhbar reported. 
The regional source told Reuters that most details in the al-Akhbar report were correct.
U.S. officials have visited Damascus only rarely since 2011, when Washington started to back protests against Assad and later some of the armed rebels seeking to oust him. 
Last year U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a CIA-run military aid program to the insurgents to be shut down. 
In November, a senior regional official close to Damascus said a senior U.S. official had met Mamlouk in the Syrian capital.
With military backing from Russia and Iran, Assad has recovered control of swathes of lost Syrian territory over the last two years and appears militarily unassailable.
U.S. forces have been fighting in Syria as part of the coalition against Islamic State, helping Kurdish-led militias to capture Raqqa and other parts of northern and eastern Syria.

533,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2018 03:02PM ET</span>",U.S. envoy Haley questions Palestinian refugee numbers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley on Tuesday appeared to question the world body's count of Palestinian refugees, the latest in a series of steps by the Trump administration challenging how relief aid is delivered to the Palestinians.
In remarks at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington think tank often sympathetic to Israel, Haley agreed with a questioner who suggested that the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNWRA), which helps Palestinian refugees, overcounts their number.
The United States earlier this year cut its aid to UNWRA to $60 million from a promised $350 million for the year.
""We will be a donor if it (UNRWA) reforms what it does ... if they actually change the number of refugees to an accurate account, we will look back at partnering them,"" Haley said.
UNWRA says it provides services to about 5 million Palestinian refugees. Most are descendants from individuals who fled Palestine in the 1948 war that led to the creation of the state of Israel.
On another emotionally charged issue, Haley also questioned the ""right of return"" to Israel, claimed by the Palestinians as part of any eventual peace settlement.
Asked whether the right of return should be ""off the table,"" Haley replied: ""I do agree with that, and I think we have to look at this in terms of what's happening (with refugees) in Syria, what's happening in Venezuela.""
""So I absolutely think we have to look at the right of return,"" she said.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his aides say they want to improve the Palestinians' plight, as well as start negotiations on an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.
But under Trump, Washington has taken a number of actions that have alienated the Palestinians, including the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. 
The status of Jerusalem - home to sites holy to the Muslim, Jewish and Christian religions - is one of the biggest obstacles to any peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.

The United Nations says the status of the ancient city - whose eastern sector was captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war - can only be resolved by negotiations.

534,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2018 02:30PM ET</span>","Defenders rally around pope, fear conservatives escalating war","By Philip Pullella
VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Supporters of Pope Francis have rushed to his defense after a former top Vatican official launched an unprecedented attack on him, a move they say dangerously escalates a campaign to weaken his papacy by conservatives who condemn him as too liberal.
Francis' supporters say the accusations in Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano's 11-page public statement aim to pave the way for a conservative pope to succeed him who would reverse his openings to divorced and homosexual Catholics.
In the statement published at the weekend, Vigano, the former Vatican ambassador to Washington, called on Francis to resign on the grounds the pope knew for years about the sexual misconduct of an American cardinal and did nothing.
Vigano said he told the pope himself five years ago, little more than three months after Francis' election. He included no supporting documents in the statement, and has not been reachable for comment since it was published.
On his flight home from Ireland on Sunday, Francis told reporters he would ""not say one word"" about the accusations.
""Read the document carefully and judge it for yourselves,"" he said.
Supporters say the statement contains holes and contradictions and point to the fact that Vigano wrote it with a journalist who has been critical of Francis as evidence that it forms part of an ideological anti-Francis strategy, which the journalist denies.
Both sides were digging in for what they have cast as a potentially defining battle over Francis's push for a more inclusive Church.
Cardinal Joseph Tobin of Newark said the statement was full of ""factual errors, innuendo and fearful ideology"".
Vigano's supporters in Italy and abroad praised the former diplomat as following his conscience.
""Vigano is a loyal Churchman ... if he is making these allegations now, and calling for Francis's resignation, it is for the gravest reasons,"" George Weigel, senior fellow in Catholic studies at the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington D.C., said in an email. 
Conservatives have previously based their attacks on the pope on doctrinal grounds. Now, his supporters say, they have raised the stakes by accusing the pope and other Vatican and Church officials of personally failing to act on a case of sexual misconduct.
Vigano's statement, signed on Aug. 22, was released four days later by conservative media outlets during the pope's trip to Ireland, where sexual abuse was a main theme.
""It really seems like an obvious move by conservatives to de-legitimize Francis,"" said David Gibson, director of the Center on Religion and Culture at Fordham University in New York. ""This whole thing was carefully coordinated with conservative Catholic media and carefully timed.""
Gibson said he believed conservatives were laying the groundwork for one of them to be elected as the next pope by damaging Francis' legacy before he dies or resigns.
""It's the start of the campaign for the next conclave.""
""NO CONSPIRACY""
The statement was co-written and edited by Italian journalist Marco Tosatti, who publishes a daily blog called Stilum Curie that is critical of Francis.
Tosatti said there was ""no conservative conspiracy"" behind the statement and that it was released as soon as it had been translated into other languages. ""The fact that is was released while the pope was in Dublin was a mere coincidence,"" he said.
Vigano wrote that Francis and his predecessor Benedict, among others, knew for years about sexual misconduct with adult seminarians by former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, the emeritus archbishop of Washington D.C., who quit last month in disgrace.
In June, American Church officials said allegations that McCarrick sexually abused a 16-year-old boy almost 50 years ago were credible and substantiated. That charge, which McCarrick denies, is what led to his resignation. He has not commented on his alleged sexual misconduct with seminarians.
Vigano alleged that Benedict, after being told about the allegations involving McCarrick and the seminarians, ordered McCarrick to retreat to a life of prayer and penitence and refrain from public ministry. Vigano said he could not remember what year the alleged sanction, which was never made public, was imposed. The Vatican usually announces such sanctions.
Vigano said he told Francis everything about McCarrick's case on June 23, 2013.
Cardinal Donald Wuerl, McCarrick's successor as Archbishop of Washington D.C., said in a statement on Monday Vigano had not produced ""any objective verifiable proof"" of his assertion.
McCarrick, who has not been seen in public since his resignation, could not be reached for comment.
Benedict's secretary, Archbishop Georg Ganswein, told Reuters the former pope had no comment on the statement.
Bloggers and journalists have found pictures of McCarrick at Church functions, including at least one in the Vatican, in the years after Vigano says Benedict had ordered the former cardinal out of the public eye.
SMALL, VOCAL GROUP
Vigano is part of a small, vocal group of conservative prelates, most of them retired or sidelined by Francis, who have balked at his calls for the Church to be more welcoming to homosexuals and divorced Catholics.
Their de facto leader is American Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke. In 2016, Burke and three other cardinals wrote a public letter known as ""The Dubia"", accusing Francis of sowing confusion on moral issues.
In April this year, Vigano attended a conservative conference, entitled ""the limits of papal authority"", where Burke was the main speaker. Tosatti was also there.

Some conference participants openly referred to Francis as the precursor of the coming of the anti-Christ and the end of the world. The conference agreed to a declaration saying ""a grave danger to the faith and the unity of the Church"" had emerged under Francis.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's new foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi complained to his Dutch counterpart on Tuesday over a planned anti-Islam cartoon contest, saying ""such acts spread hate and intolerance"". 
Far-right Dutch parliamentarian Geert Wilders has planned the contest for later in the year, and caricatures of the Muslim Prophet Mohammed are to be exhibited. 
A Pakistani foreign office statement said Qureshi said the planned event would hurt the feelings of Muslims around the world.
Qureshi said later he planned to take up the issue with several world leaders. ""We have raised this issue at several levels,"" he said. ""We have contacted the United Nations. We have contacted the European Union."" 
Pakistan's upper house of parliament on Monday condemned the contest. Prime Minister Imran Khan said: ""They don't understand how much they hurt us when they do such acts."" 
An extremist Islamist party Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan is organizing a protest march against the contest on Wednesday.
The protesters are scheduled to march from the eastern city of Lahore to the capital Islamabad.
Wilders plans to display the cartoons on the walls of his political party's room in parliament. He says he's had ""hundreds"" of entries. 
""This contest is not an initiative by the government,"" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said last week. 
""This contest is not something I would do.""

536,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2018 02:10PM ET</span>",Former UK chief rabbi calls opposition leader Corbyn an anti-Semite,"By Andrew MacAskill
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's former chief rabbi Jonathan Sacks has called Labour opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn an anti-Semite and said comments about Zionists he made five years ago were the most offensive by a senior UK politician in half a century.
Labour has been battling accusations of anti-Semitism for months, and Corbyn has previously apologized for what he has described as ""pockets"" of anti-Semitism in his party.
Sacks, who was Britain's chief rabbi from 1991 to 2013, accused Corbyn of having ""given support to racists, terrorists and dealers of hate who want to kill Jews and remove Israel from the map"".
He said Corbyn had depicted a group of British citizens as ""essentially alien"" when it was revealed last week he said in 2013 that British Zionists ""don't understand English irony"" despite ""having lived in this country for a very long time"".
""When he implies that, however long they have lived here, Jews are not fully British, he is using the language of classic pre-war European anti-Semitism,"" Sacks told the New Statesman political magazine. 
""Now, within living memory of the Holocaust, and while Jews are being murdered elsewhere in Europe for being Jews, we have an anti-Semite as the leader of the Labour party and Her Majesty’s opposition. That is why Jews feel so threatened by Mr Corbyn and those who support him.""
Labour said in a statement there is no place for anti-Semitism in their party and that they are committed to rebuilding trust with the Jewish community.
Some opinion polls put Labour ahead or level with Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservatives, meaning he is a potential British leader, although the next election is not due until 2022.
Sacks compared Corbyn's comments to the infamous ""Rivers of blood"" speech by Enoch Powell in 1968 in which the then-Conservative shadow cabinet member warned of the dangers of immigration. His speech is widely regarded as one of the most divisive made by a modern British politician.
Labour dismissed the comparison with Powell as ""absurd and offensive"".
Since unexpectedly becoming Labour leader in 2015 after decades spent on the left-wing fringes of the party, Corbyn has repeatedly faced accusations of turning a blind eye to anti-Semitic comments in the party and among groups he supports.
Corbyn has responded to protests by meeting Jewish community leaders, reassuring Jewish people they are welcome in the party.
In his 2013 speech to a meeting convened by the Palestinian Return Centre, Corbyn spoke about the importance of history and of how necessary it was for people to understand the origins of the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.
He said Zionists had ""two problems"" - firstly, that they do not study history and, secondly, they do not understand English irony.

After the emergence of footage, Labour asserted that Corbyn had been referring to a ""group of pro-Israel activists"" and had not been singling out Jewish people as a whole.

Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura has invited the United States and six other countries for talks in Geneva next month, a U.N. spokeswoman said on Tuesday, as the United Nations continues its push for a new Syrian constitution.
He plans to meet senior representatives from the United States, Britain, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Germany, France and Egypt on Sept. 14, two days after he receives officials from Russia, Turkey and Iran for previously announced talks.
""This is going to be an opportunity to discuss the way ahead on the political process,"" U.N. spokeswoman Alessandra Vellucci said.
A U.S. State Department official said the United States would be represented by James Jeffrey, the newly minted special representative for Syria, and Joel Rayburn, the administration's special envoy for Syria.
De Mistura is tasked with forming a committee of Syrian citizens to draw up the new constitution, after receiving nominations from the Syrian government and the opposition. 
The planned meetings follow a similar set of talks with both groups of countries in June, although Egypt was not involved in that round.
The discussions about setting up a constitutional committee have made slow progress and represent a big downgrade in the United Nations' ambitions for Syrian peace talks. 
For two years the warring sides repeatedly came to Geneva, in a futile search for agreement on political reforms, a new constitution and new elections. 
But this year, with little U.S. political involvement and major gains on the battlefield by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his Russian and Iranian allies, the U.N. political process has largely evaporated.

The U.S. State Department official said the United States would remain engaged with the United Nations and other parties, including Russia, to encourage all possible efforts to advance the political process, and it supported de Mistura's efforts to broker a political settlement.

Several incidents, apparently recorded by victims or bystanders during the Muslim Eid al-Adha holiday last week and posted on social media, left many Egyptians in shock.
One showed a brawl in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria where a 40-year-old man was stabbed to death when he tried to fend off another man harassing his wife. 
Local media said the unidentified 39-year-old attacker was in custody.
In another social media post, a crowd of young men in the Nile delta city of Damanhour fought off a motorbike rider as he tried to rescue three women being mobbed on a public street.
The authenticity of the recordings could not be independently verified, but some local media had reported on them.
In a statement first issued on Monday, al-Azhar said sexual harassment in any form was deviant behavior, and rejected any attempt to blame the way some women dress or behave.
""Al-Azhar has closely followed up the reports of sexual harassment incidents recently circulated by the mass media outlets and social media networks including harassers’ violent attacks on those trying to save women,"" the statement, also issued in English on Tuesday, said. 
""Al-Azhar asserts that criminalizing harassment and those who commit harassment must be absolute and without any condition or context,"" it added.
The statement rejected any attempt to blame women for sexual harassment, saying abuse ""violates women's privacy, freedom and human dignity"".
Al-Azhar demanded the activation of all laws that punish sexual abuse and called for efforts to raise social awareness.
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ordered a crackdown on sexual harassment after he was elected for his first term in office in 2014, following an incident in which seven men were arrested for attacking women near Cairo’s Tahrir Square (NYSE:SQ) during his inauguration celebrations,
Earlier this year, an Egyptian court jailed a Lebanese woman for eight years for insulting Egypt and Egyptians after she posted a video on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) complaining of sexual harassment.

DRESDEN/BERLIN (Reuters) - Far-right groups spread ""fake news"" on social media to mobilize their supporters for violent protests targeting migrants after the fatal stabbing of a German man, said officials in the eastern German state of Saxony where they took place.
German police have arrested a 22-year-old Syrian man and a 21-year-old Iraqi man over Sunday's stabbing in the town of Chemnitz, which provoked two days of protests, including clashes between far-right and leftist demonstrators.
The stabbing and the protests have exposed deep divisions in German society over the influx of more than one million migrants, mostly Muslims fleeing Middle East conflicts, after Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision in 2015 to let them in. 
On Tuesday Merkel repeated her condemnation of both the stabbing and the protests, saying scenes - depicted in amateur video clips - of migrants being chased through the streets were completely unacceptable in a state based on the rule of law.
Michael Kretschmer, the premier of Saxony and a close Merkel ally, vowed to deal firmly with extremists in his state, long a hotbed of support for far-right parties.
""We believe that at least some of the calls that were circulated online (to join the protests) were based on false information, on fake news,"" he told a news conference in the state capital Dresden.
For example, a report circulated widely on social media that the 35-year-old man who was stabbed had been defending a woman from migrants, adding that there was no evidence to support the claim, Kretschmer said.
Local authorities were bracing for further demonstrations in Dresden and Chemnitz on Tuesday, and German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said federal police stood ready to provide additional assistance if needed in Saxony.
HITLER SALUTES
Saxony's interior minister, Roland Woeller, said the protests had drawn far-right supporters and anarchist groups from Berlin, nearby states of Brandenburg and Thuringia and as far away as North-Rhine Westphalia in northwestern Germany.
""We saw a significant mobilization effect – that means that anarchists traveled from far beyond the region and state borders, especially right-wing violent actors ... from the hooligan scene and from the football scene,"" he told reporters.
At least five people are facing charges for performing the 'Hitler salute', which is banned in Germany, and a comprehensive investigation is continuing, police officials said.
They also said nearly 20 people had been injured in Monday's demonstrations, where fireworks were thrown.
German security officials are monitoring the situation in close consultation with state officials at a special command center for combating far-right activism in Cologne, security sources told Reuters.
Many far-right supporters in Chemnitz joined a small but growing party called ""Third Way"" after a Nazi-inspired group was banned about four years ago. The new party is also under observation by intelligence agencies, according to the latest report by the BfV domestic intelligence agency.
""The fact that we have a Syrian and an Iraqi suspect is no reason - no reason at all - for a general suspicion of all foreign residents,"" said Kretschmer.

""We need a jolt in Germany and Saxony. We need broad public support to win this fight.""

The 80-year-old Piano, who shot to fame with the design of the Centre Pompidou in Paris in the 1970s and decades later designed The Shard in London, lives in France but still keeps an office near Genoa.
The project was announced after a discussion between the regional governor of Liguria, Giovanni Toti, and Piano.
""My commitment is above all moral, to make sure that the new bridge has the traits of Genoa, of our qualities and a little of our parsimony,"" Piano told reporters after the meeting.
""I can't think of anything else but that bridge.""
Italy's populist government has pledged to strip the state concession to the toll road company that managed the bridge, and to have it rebuilt quickly, preferably by the state-controlled Fincantieri. 
The collapsed bridge, completed in 1967, was seen as an avant-garde work of engineering at the time, and became a symbol connecting two sides of a city that snaked along the seashore. 
""Renzo Piano voluntarily offered, as a competent Genovese, to give this new bridge project as gift to the city,"" Toti said. ""We happily accepted the help, and he's already made a few proposals.""

The thrust of the bill, which had not been signed into law, has been overtaken by a proposal by the ANC to change the constitution to allow the expropriation of land without compensation.
The bill was meant to enable the state to pay for land at a value determined by a government adjudicator and then expropriate it for the ""public interest"", ending the willing-buyer, willing-seller approach to land reform.
However, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa announced on Aug. 1 the ANC plans to change the constitution to allow the expropriation of land without compensation, as whites still own most of South Africa’s territory.
South Africans are taking part in public hearings on land reform that are being held countrywide, to give their comments on the ANC's proposal to change the constitution.
""The bill in its current form would need to be re-considered in light of the process of reviewing Section 25 of the constitution for the expropriation of land without compensation,"" Nonceba Mhlauli, a spokeswoman for the ANC's chief whip, said.
""Were the bill to be re-introduced, it would contain a clause or clauses reflecting expropriation of land without compensation if that is the way that South Africans have chosen to go,"" she said.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Talk of Britain leaving the European Union without an exit deal is more a negotiating position than a reality as such a scenario would benefit neither side, Ireland's foreign minister told Reuters on Tuesday.
With just seven months to go until it leaves the EU on March 29, Britain has yet to reach an agreement with the bloc on the terms of its departure. British Prime Minister Theresa May's plan for a ""business-friendly"" deal has failed to impress negotiators in Brussels and has been heavily criticized at home.
Earlier on Tuesday, Sky News reported that May had said that failing to secure a deal with the EU before Britain leaves the bloc next year ""wouldn't be the end of the world"".
But Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told Reuters: ""I think the chances of a no-deal Brexit are very slim.""
""I think talk of being able to survive or manage a no-deal Brexit is more a negotiating position than it is reality,"" he added in an interview. ""Nobody benefits from a 'no-deal' Brexit and we all have a responsibility to ensure that doesn't happen.""
The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said earlier this month a deal with Britain was needed ""not much later"" than in early November and that the bloc was not working towards a ""no-deal"" Brexit, though it had to prepare for it.
""I think it is possible to get a deal well in advance of the end of the year,"" Coveney said. 
Turning to migration policy, another big issue vexing the EU, Coveney called for ""action and practical measures"" and said all member states needed to make a contribution.
The EU has sought a common migration policy since 2015, when more than a million refugees, mostly from the Middle East and Africa, entered the bloc, putting a heavy burden on countries like Greece and Italy at the edge of Schengen.
The Czech Republic and other central European countries like Hungary, Poland and Slovakia have long opposed a Brussels-prescribed quota system to re-distribute asylum seekers.
The idea was officially dropped at an EU summit in June, replaced with agreements to share out refugees on a voluntary basis and other measures to deal with asylum requests.
""Countries that are willing to take migrants and refugees in order to share the burden with countries that are bordering the Mediterranean should be encouraged to do that,"" Coveney said.
""And countries that refuse to actually take migrants, I believe should be made to actually make significant financial contributions to helping the EU response towards the overall migration crisis.""

OMSK/MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin hinted on Tuesday he was ready to soften an unpopular proposal to reform the pension system which has pushed his approval rating down to its lowest level in more than four years.
He said he would deliver his views in a public statement on the issue, perhaps as soon as Wednesday, adding he was aware of public unhappiness about the proposed reform and decisions had to be undertaken cautiously.
""I ask you not to forget that our decisions will affect the fates of millions of people and must be fair. One should not act mechanically, formally, but only take a balanced and cautious approach,"" Putin said.
Lawmakers, in a preliminary vote in July, backed a government proposal to sharply raise the retirement age, part of a controversial budget package designed to shore up state finances.
Putin, who once promised never to raise the retirement age, had until now been careful to distance himself from the proposed reforms, which envisage raising the retirement age to 65 from 60 for men and to 63 from 55 for women.
Polls show that around 90 percent of the population oppose the proposed reform. 
But on Tuesday he told a government meeting in the Siberian city of Omsk that he would soon intervene. 
""In the nearest future, maybe even tomorrow, I will formulate my attitude (to the reform) in detail and will make the respective statement.""
Putin said any decision on the pension system had to be balanced and cautious. He said he was aware of the public's extremely negative reaction to the proposed reform.
""Of course, all this has drawn a predictable reaction, a rather sharp discussion in public,"" Putin said, adding that any changes in the pension age must provide a decent standard of living for Russia's 147 million-strong population.
'POLITICALLY SENSITIVE'
The retirement age proposal is politically sensitive for Putin, who was re-elected in March, because it has prompted a series of protests across Russia since it was announced on June 14, the day Russia played the first match of its soccer World Cup.
According to opinion polls, Putin's approval ratings have fallen to levels last seen before Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea which provided the Russian leader with a popularity boost.
Putin's spokesman on Tuesday dismissed speculation that Putin had been pushed into addressing the issue by a drop in his approval ratings, however.
While Putin said authorities could not act ""routinely"" and ""formally"" when it came to reforming the pension system, he made clear that some kind of reform was needed though.
""... We need to take into account the current situation in the economy and the labor market, we must understand what the future holds for the country in 10, 20 and even 30 years,"" Putin said.
He said he had asked the government to consult with political parties, public organizations and regional administrations to review the legislation before its second reading in the State Duma, the lower house of parliament.

Lawmakers passed the bill in the first reading in July. To become law, the bill must pass three readings in the State Duma and must then be approved by the upper house and finally signed into law by the president.

The explosion took place in front of a restaurant on a highway in Isulan in Sultan Kudarat province.
An initial investigation was underway and there were no suspects or immediate claims of responsibility, police said.
The province is on the Philippines' second-largest island, Mindanao, parts of which have been plagued by decades of Maoist and Islamist rebellions that have given rise to banditry and extremism. Mindanao remains under martial law until the end of the year.

The incident comes a month after a bomb was detonated in a van that was stopped at a military checkpoint on the island of Basilan which killed 11 people, including four civilians. 
Islamic State claimed responsibility, which the military disputes, suspecting that a local group was behind it, with the intended target civilians in an urban area.

Polls show the Social Democrats remain Sweden's biggest party, but their support has slumped since 2014 when they took power in a minority coalition with the Greens.
Swedes already enjoy a statutory five weeks of vacation a year for full-time employees as well as long parental leave, making them the envy of many in Europe.
""It is hard for many workers to take time off when schools are on holiday or when kids have study days,"" the Social Democrats said in a statement.
""That's why we want to give more help to parents who work.""
The plan, which will cost 5.4 billion Swedish crowns ($590 million) annually, will mean parents will be able to take 5 extra days a year of leave if they have children aged between 4 and 16.
Prime Minister Stefan Lofven has promised 35 billion Swedish crowns extra for welfare services over the next four years as well as more spending on the police and the military. 
The Social Democrats have around 25 percent support in polls, ahead of the Moderates and Sweden Democrats. 
In 2014, the Social Democrats got 31 percent.
Neither the center-left bloc, which includes the Greens and Left Party, nor the four-party centre-right Alliance looks likely to get a majority.
However, complex political maneuvers mean Moderate leader Ulf Kristersson is the bookies' favorite to become the next prime minister.
To do that, he needs at least the passive support of the Sweden Democrats, a party with roots in the neo-Nazi fringe and which has around 20 percent support. Kristersson has ruled out a formal deal, which would split his own party and the Alliance. 
But he could become prime minister even so if the Sweden Democrats back a parliamentary vote to dismiss Lofven after the election - which is likely - and abstain on a vote on his candidacy.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's dominant ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing Technology Co Ltd said on Tuesday it would prioritize safety over growth as a measure of success after a 20-year-old passenger was murdered by her Didi driver last week.
The case sparked outrage on social media and concerns over safety issues in the fast-growing ride-hailing sector in China, prompting Didi to say that it would suspend its Hitch service indefinitely until it comes up with a safety mechanism acceptable to its users. 
""The tragedy reminded us we have walked this path without enough respect or humility,"" Didi founder Cheng Wei and President Jean Liu said in an emailed statement.
""We see clearly this is because our vanity overtook our original belief. We raced non-stop, riding on the force of breathless expansion and capital, through these few years; but this has no meaning in such a tragic loss of life."" 
The company said it would now prioritize safety as the single most important performance indicator, and shift the organization and its resources towards building strong safety and customer service systems. 
Didi will make upgrades to safety products like its SOS button and itinerary share function, and plans to work closely with China's law enforcement agencies to, among other things, set up a system to allow its passengers to call the police during any threats of danger, it said.
Founded in 2012, Didi has through rapid expansion and a series of mergers become the world's largest ride-sharing firm by rides, making 30 million trips a day. 
The killing of a 20-year-old passenger who rode in the Didi vehicle on Friday in the eastern city of Wenzhou was the second such incident since May. 
It triggered widespread online criticism of the firm and prompted Chinese regulators to announce they would tighten oversight of its transport industry.
Chinese media reported on Tuesday that Didi had met with regulators in at least 10 Chinese cities -- including Chongqing, Guangzhou and Tianjin -- and in some meetings was told that its local operating license could be taken away if it did not improve passenger safety and dismiss unqualified drivers. 
Didi had declined to comment on the meetings. 
The incident has remained a hot topic of discussion on Chinese social media. 
Earlier in the day, police said they had detained two men accused by Chinese social media users of making offensive remarks about the Didi victim.
Police in the southern city of Shenzhen said they arrested a 22-year-old man who posted comments in a chat group on Tencent's messaging service QQ. The group has over 1,000 members and calls itself the ""Shenzhen Didi Exchange Group"". 
A 29-year-old man was arrested separately in the central city of Wuhan after he made comments in a QQ group named the ""Wuhan Didi Official Group"", Wuhan police said on their official Twitter-like Weibo account on Monday. 
It was unclear whether the two men were Didi drivers, but such groups are regularly used by Didi drivers to communicate while on the road. 

Didi said it did not have any official driver WeChat or QQ Groups and said it would work with the authorities to identify the men. ""Any Didi-registered driver involved in this will be permanently banned,"" a Didi spokeswoman told Reuters.

The reinforcement comes as Russia's ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, is believed to be considering an assault on the last big rebel-held enclave, Idlib in the north. 
Russia has accused the United States of building up its own forces in the Middle East in preparation for a possible strike on Syrian government forces.
On Saturday, the Admiral Grigorovich and Admiral Essen frigates sailed through Istanbul's Bosphorus towards the Mediterranean, Reuters pictures showed. 
The day before, the Pytlivy frigate and landing ship Nikolai Filchenkov were pictured sailing through the Turkish straits that connect the Black Sea with the Mediterranean. The Vishny Volochek missile corvette passed through earlier this month. 
The Izvestia newspaper said Russia had gathered its largest naval presence in the Mediterranean Sea since it intervened in Syria in 2015 turning the tide in Assad's favor.
The force included 10 vessels, most of them armed with long-range Kalibr cruise missiles, Izvestia wrote, adding that more were on the way, and that two submarines had also been deployed.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greek authorities have arrested two aid workers and are investigating a total of 30 from the same organization on the island of Lesbos on suspicion they smuggled migrants into Greece, spied and laundered money, police said on Tuesday.
Police said in a statement the suspects, 24 foreign nationals and six Greeks, had been active on the island since at least late 2015 as part of a non-governmental organization, whose name the authorities would not disclose.
Lesbos, not far from Turkey in the northeast Aegean Sea, was the preferred entry point into the European Union in 2015 for nearly a million Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis, and dozens of aid groups operated on Lesbos at the time.
Over 19,000 refugees and migrants have crossed to Greece from Turkey so far this year, according to data from the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR. 
Police said the suspected crime ring allegedly ""provided direct assistance to organized migrant trafficking rings.""
They said the group obtained ""significant amounts of money,"" including from donations, without disclosing the amount.
The 30 workers are being investigated on a case-by-case basis on suspicion of ""establishing and joining a criminal organization, money laundering, espionage, violating state secrets, counterfeiting and offenses against the immigration code and electronic communication legislation,"" police said. 
They allegedly obtained confidential information on refugee flows from Turkey and illegally monitored the radio communications of the Greek coast guard and the EU's border agency Frontex.
The authorities launched the investigation after two foreigners were spotted on Lesbos in February driving a car with fake, military-type license plates affixed on top of the legal plates.
This is not the first investigation involving people working with migrants in Greece. In May, a Greek court acquitted three Spanish and two Danish volunteers accused of people smuggling.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Every Saturday for 23 years, dozens of people have held a vigil in a central Istanbul square, sitting in silence and holding pictures of relatives who went missing in police detention.
The group was about to stage their 700th demonstration last Saturday when Turkish police told them their protest was banned, before firing tear gas and plastic pellets to disperse the crowd and detaining dozens - including a 82 year-old woman who was among the first to protest in 1995 in search of her son.
The sit-in by the so-called Saturday Mothers was one of the few remaining public protests near Istanbul's Taksim square, once a vibrant demonstration ground but now off-limits for opposition groups.
Critics say that breaking up the vigil was another sign that NATO member Turkey is drifting into more authoritarian rule under President Tayyip Erdogan, adding to Ankara's already deteriorating record on human rights and media freedoms.
Casting the protest as a cover for supporting terrorism, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said the Saturday Mothers were linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and hinted the vigils would no longer be allowed.
""This has been one of Turkey's oldest civil disobedience movements,"" said Ahmet Sik, former journalist and a lawmaker for the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), who was at Saturday's protest. 
""There was a time when the police helped these people to do their vigil. To criminalize such an established protest now is an attempt to intimidate the rest of the public,"" he said.
Turkey in July lifted a two year-long state of emergency during which 150,000 civil servants were purged and 77,000 people suspected of links to a failed coup in 2016 were charged.
But opponents say Erdogan's new executive presidency and a counter-terrorism law passed last month equips him with sweeping powers to stifle opposition.
Soylu said on Monday that authorities blocked the sit-in because participants were ""trying to create victims through motherhood and mask terrorism through that victimization.""
At a news conference in Istanbul, the group denied links to any militant group and pointed out Erdogan, when he was prime minister in 2011, met them and pledged support.
They also vowed to continue their protest.
""Nobody is using us. Nobody has made us come here,"" said Hanife Yildiz, whose son Murat went missing in police detention in 1995. 
""I handed over my son to the state and I haven't gotten him back since."" 
'REPEAT OF THE 1990s'
The silent vigils of Saturday Mothers began as a protest against what they say was the disappearance of relatives in police detention and extrajudicial killings in the 1990s.
At the time, when conflict with the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) was at its height, such disappearances and killings were common, mostly in Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast.
Emine Ocak, who was briefly detained on Saturday, was among those at the first sit-in after her son Hasan Ocak went missing following clashes with police in Istanbul in 1995.
Soylu rejected that Ocak had gone missing in detention and said he was a member of an ultra leftist terrorist organization and that he was killed after a row within the group but the Saturday Mothers were trying to put the blame on the state.
Emine Ocak's picture - the image of a white-haired elderly woman shouting as she was taken by riot police - went viral across Twitter. Her son Huseyin, Hasan's brother, told Reuters police intervention was unexpected.
""There seems to be a new security approach in the state that very much resembles the one in the 1990s,"" Huseyin Ocak said.
""I was there at the meeting with Erdogan on Feb 5, 2011. He said, 'your problem is my cabinet's problem."" He also promised to find our relatives, he added.
State investigations have shed light on some of the cases pursued by the Saturday Mothers. A 2011 parliament report found that Cemil Kirbayir, who went missing during a 1980 coup, died under torture.

""Since 1995 we have continued our rightful and silent resistance,"" Cemil's brother Mikail said. ""You will not be able to remove us from that square.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - African migrants rejected by Italy in a standoff with the European Union last week said they had been held by smugglers for up to two years in Libya and many had been beaten, tortured and raped, the U.N. migration agency said on Tuesday.
The 150 migrants, mainly Eritreans and Somalis, were rescued in the Mediterranean on Aug. 15 but waited 10 days while Italy's anti-immigrant government refused to let them disembark, until Ireland, Albania and the Vatican agreed to accept them.
A further 27 unaccompanied minors and 13 people needing urgent hospital treatment had earlier been allowed ashore in Italy, whose government had threatened to cut funds to the European Union unless other states took in the migrants.
The U.N. International Organization for Migration (IOM) said its staff had gathered testimony from the migrants. 
All were malnourished and exhausted and said they had been held against their will in Libya for up to two years, IOM spokesman Joel Millman told a U.N. briefing in Geneva.
""In Libya they complained that many had been beaten and tortured by smugglers and traffickers seeking ransom money from their families in their countries of origin,"" he said. 
""Italian doctors who attended all the women ... reported that many of them said they had been raped while in Libya.""
He said IOM believed thousands of migrants were still being detained - held in safehouses or warehoused, but getting people to the shore had recently become more difficult because of violence in the west of the country. 
A drop in the value of the Libyan dinar had also made it more difficult for sub-Saharan Africans hoping to earn enough in Libya to fund their sea voyage to Europe, prompting the smugglers to look for other nationalities with more resources.
Italian Interior Minister Salvini, who has led a popular crackdown against immigration since his government took office in June, has said he was under investigation by a Sicilian prosecutor for abuse of office, kidnapping and illegal arrest over the migrant standoff.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) on Tuesday called on judges to convict a former Congo military leader on charges ranging from murder and rape to conscripting child soldiers and sexual slavery.
""The evidence shows that Bosco Ntaganda personally committed crimes,"" Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said, in closing remarks in Ntaganda's three-year trial. Ntanganda denies wrongdoing.
""He persecuted and attacked civilians, he murdered them, pillaged their goods, destroyed their charities and hospitals. And he enlisted and used children under the age of 15 to participate directly in hostilities,"" Bensouda said.
Ntaganda faces 18 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for acts allegedly committed in 2002-2003 when he was deputy Chief of Staff of the Union of Congolose Patriots (UPC), a militia group in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Bensouda told judges the case would prove a landmark in that it is recognized the sexual enslavement of soldiers as a separate crime within the court's jurisdiction.
Ntaganda's lawyers are due to respond on Wednesday. During the trial Ntaganda testified in his own defense, arguing he was a peacemaker who had tried to keep order amid a power vacuum in the mineral-ich Ituri region of northeast Congo in the early 2000s. 
He said he had been unfairly tagged with the nickname ""Terminator,"" that witnesses against him had given false testimony, and that he had never harmed civilians.
Ntaganda surrendered at the U.S. Embassy in neighboring Rwanda in 2013, seven years after his indictment, asking to be turned over to the ICC after apparently having fled Congo due to infighting among military groups.
In Tuesday's closing remarks, Bensouda summarized testimony from witnesses to crimes allegedly committed by troops under Ntaganda's command.
""A lot of people were executed by hand with machetes ... some of them were disemboweled, even pregnant women,"" Bensouda said, quoting a witness identified as P-105, who was describing the slaughter of a group of around 50 members of the ethnic Lendu tribe. The Lendu were allegedly targeted for expulsion from Ituri by Ntaganda's UPC, which was dominated by the rival Hema clan.
Bensouda also cited from the testimony of a girl who had allegedly been conscripted and regularly raped by Ntaganda's soldiers. She and others were referred by them to with a slur which translated as ""common pot."" 
Ntaganda plans to address the court word after the end of the closing arguments.
No date for a verdict has yet been set.

560,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2018 09:20AM ET</span>",Exclusive: France restricts travel by diplomats to Iran,"By John Irish
PARIS (Reuters) - France has told its diplomats and foreign ministry officials to postpone indefinitely all non-essential travel to Iran, citing a foiled bomb plot and a hardening of Tehran's attitude towards France, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.
Any hardening of relations with France could have wider implications for Iran. France has been one of the strongest advocates of salvaging a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, which U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of in May.
Iran's economy has been hammered by the prospect of the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions that had been lifted under the deal. European countries including France have pledged to try to soften the economic blow, but have been unable so far to persuade their firms to defy Washington and stay in Iran.
French oil and gas major Total and its carmakers PSA and  Renault  (PA:RENA) have led an exodus of European companies from Iran, fearful of the extra-territorial reach of Washington's sanctions.
The memo cites a foiled plot to bomb a rally held by an exiled Iranian opposition group near Paris that was attended by Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani as a sign of Tehran's more aggressive stance towards France. 
""The behavior of the Iranian authorities suggests a hardening of their position vis-a-vis our country, as well as some of our allies,"" Maurice Gourdault-Montagne, the ministry's secretary general wrote in the notice dated Aug. 20. 
    ""Given the known security risks ... all departmental officers, whether from headquarters or (overseas) posts, are required to defer until further notice, except for urgent work, any travel plans in Iran,"" Gourdault-Montagne added.
The instructions were also relayed to officials in government departments outside the foreign ministry to be passed on to staff who intended to travel to Iran, a separate memo obtained by Reuters showed. 
The French foreign ministry declined to comment on the memo or say whether embassy staff had been asked to repatriate their families. Iranian officials at the Embassy in Paris did not respond to a request for comment. 
France's latest travel advisory for its citizens, published on May 10, cautions against visitors entering Iran with electronic equipment such as drones and walkie-talkies and taking too many photographs.
RELATIONS SOUR
The memo underscores how confidence in the Tehran government has been eroded in Paris as relations between the two become increasingly strained, even as President Emmanuel Macron talks up preserving the nuclear accord.
Iran has said it had nothing to do with the alleged plot to attack a National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) meeting on June 30. Germany has detained an Iranian diplomat based in Austria. Belgium, where the plot was uncovered, has sought the diplomat's extradition.
French officials have not commented on the matter but diplomatic sources have said privately that if Iran's involvement were proven then it would be difficult for France not to react strongly.
Since pulling out of the nuclear accord, Trump has expressed a readiness to negotiate a new deal while warning Tehran of dire consequences ""the like of which few throughout history have suffered before"" if it made threats against the United States.
It was Macron who led efforts to persuade Trump to stick with the agreement, arguing it was the best means Western powers had to check Iran's nuclear activities.
Rouhani on Monday urged the remaining signatories to the nuclear agreement to act to save the pact.
Macron reiterated France's commitment to maintaining the accord, but Europe's leaders have appeared powerless to prevent the U.S. sanctions inflicting pain on Iran's economy.
The ministry memo said any staffer who traveled to Iran for personal reasons would not be shielded by diplomatic immunity, even if holding a diplomatic passport. It made specific reference to tourism and language classes.

Britain's foreign ministry said its advice on Iran to diplomats was the same as to the British public. It flags the risks of terrorist attacks and arbitrary detentions and advises against all travel to the frontiers with Iraq and Afghanistan.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya’s deputy chief justice Philomena Mwilu was arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of corruption, failure to pay tax, and improper dealings with a local bank now in receivership, the police and the country’s top prosecutor said.
Chief Public Prosecutor Noordin Mohamed Haji told a news conference that Mwilu had abused her office for personal gain, undermining public integrity in the judiciary. The director of criminal investigations, George Kinoti, told Reuters in a text message: ""I can confirm the arrest of the deputy chief justice.""
Reuters was unable to immediately contact representatives of Mwilu.
Corruption in East Africa’s biggest economy drains billions of dollars from the state each year. The government has launched a new anti-graft push this year led by Haji, a former deputy head of national intelligence, who has brought criminal charges against dozens of civil servants and businesspeople.
The detention of the deputy chief justice was the highest profile since a series of corruption-related arrests began several months ago.
""Lady Justice Mwilu... accepted gifts in the form of money which undermined confidence in her office,"" said Haji.
He said Mwilu had also obtained ""execution of a security belonging to Imperial Bank, now under receivership, by false pretence"" and had ""conducted herself in total disregard of the law"", citing what he said was her failure to pay tax. Haji gave no further details.
""I have concluded that the evidence is sufficient for a reasonable prospect of conviction and it is in the public interest that criminal proceedings should be preferred,"" Haji said.

SHENZHEN/BEIJING (Reuters) - Some Chinese student activists detained after a raid last week have been escorted back to their hometowns by police and their parents, labor activists said on Tuesday. 
Police in riot gear stormed an apartment in the southern Chinese city of Huizhou on Friday where the students and other activists were staying while they supported factory workers seeking to form a union. 
Labor activism is viewed as a challenge by the ruling Communist Party, which opposes independent unions and punishes protesters.
The Jasic Workers Support Group said on its website that 50 people were staying at the apartment at the time of the raid.
Protests broke out in the southern province of Guangdong early last month after workers at Jasic International, a welding machinery firm, were fired when they tried to form a union.
About 50 labor activists, most of them students, traveled to Guangdong to back the workers.
The released students were sent home separately without their telephones and were under surveillance, labor activists said. It was not clear how many were sent home.
Authorities raided and detained supporters of the labor movement in other parts of the country at the same time last Friday, said Zhang Shengye, a graduate of Peking University who was escorted back to his hometown on Friday, in a statement posted on the Jasic website.
""My sorrow will not lower my spirits, my anger will not cause me to lose reason, being under surveillance will not intimidate me into surrendering,"" Zhang wrote. 
The students' telephones, computers, hard drives and other electronic gadgets were in the possession of police, Zhang said in his post. 
Calls to the police in the area went unanswered.
On July 27, police detained 29 people, including former Jasic workers, their families and supporters. Fourteen people remain in detention.
Three Jasic workers who were initially released on bail after a week in detention were detained again after Friday's raid, a labor activist said on Tuesday. 
OTHERS DETAINED
Several of the activists detained in Friday's raid are students or recent graduates from China's top universities and have been active in a range of social justice issues, according to activists and the group supporting the workers, which posted information on its website.
Yue Xin, a Peking University graduate and activist in the Jasic case, was among those detained on Friday, the sources said. Yue gained prominence in April when she pressed the university to make public an investigation into a decades-old rape and suicide case. 
Two others detained in Friday's raid - Xu Zhongliang and Zheng Yongming - had been detained in Guangzhou last November after participating in a reading group to improve the plight of factory workers.
Another activist, Gu Jiayue, was detained in Beijing early on Friday, the sources said.
Gu was among 20 students, activists and two worker representatives from Jasic who submitted letters of petition to the All-China Federations of Trade Unions and the All-China Women's Federation last week. 
Gu and a colleague, Yang Xiaoqiang, have contributed to the online Pioneer Magazine launched by recent graduates in April. 
Song Yangbiao, a freelance journalist, said Yang was also in detention. Song told Reuters he was detained for 10 hours on Friday in his hometown in the eastern province of Jiangsu before being released. 
Shang Kai, editor of Red Reference news, a publication that supports students and factory workers, was also detained on Friday in Beijing, after 20 police from Guangdong province raided the paper's offices, the publication said in a statement.

Supporters of an independent candidate contesting a parliamentary by-election stoned Museveni's motorcade on Aug. 13 as he was leaving the town of Arua after campaigning for a ruling party candidate.
Songwriter Robert Kyagulanyi, who is also a lawmaker, was among dozens of people detained shortly afterwards on suspicion of taking part in the assault. Their lawyers and others have said the detainees have suffered beatings and torture, accusations the government has rejected as ""rubbish"".
In a letter to Museveni dated Aug. 27, Parliament Speaker Rebecca Kadaga said those responsible for any maltreatment of the detainees must be brought to justice.
""I am concerned that no effort has been made to arrest the security officers from the (Special Forces Command), Military Police and Uganda Police Force who were involved in the violent actions against unarmed civilians,"" she wrote in the letter.
""This is therefore to demand that the officers concerned be apprehended at the earliest opportunity and presented in court. The Uganda parliament will not condone or acquiesce in acts of torture.""
The arrests sparked two days of anti-government protests in the capital Kampala and other towns last week.
Protesters and opposition supporters accuse Museveni, in power since 1986, of stifling dissent through intimidation, beatings and detentions, charges which his government denies.
On Monday a Ugandan High Court granted bail to the 33 people.
PRESIDENT TO RESPOND
Presidential spokesman Don Wanyama could not confirm whether the letter had reached Museveni, but said the issues it purportedly raised had been handled.
""It was President Museveni who was the first to condemn the violence and shooting of civilians during and after (the by-election)"", Wanyama said.
""He ordered the arrest of police officers who shot dead a civilian in Mityana Town,"" Wanyama said, adding that the president would respond once he received the letter. 
This is the second time Kadaga has written a letter to Museveni demanding action about attacks on lawmakers.
Last year when soldiers attached to Museveni's office stormed parliament and beat up lawmakers during a debate on scrapping the presidential age limit, Kadaga wrote to him and complained about the incident, Ugandan media reported.
The presidential age limit has been removed, opening the way for Museveni - now 74 - to seek re-election in 2021.

The town was one of the major centers of the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad and suffered massive damage during the fighting, forcing most of its people to leave.
Assad's military and its allies regained control of Daraya after years of bitter siege and bombing. Many who did not want to live under state rule left along with rebel fighters under a surrender deal in August 2016. 
Civilians and fighters who feared state rule were bussed out to insurgent territory in the north, while others - who most likely are those now returning to the town - were displaced to government territory around the capital. 
Displaced people were returning after Daraya was ""purged of remnants of the terrorists and the main services were reinstated"", state TV said. 
State news agency SANA showed pictures of crowds gathering under large government flags and photos of Assad. Behind them, rows of buildings, their windows blown out, appeared pitted with shellholes and showed heavy damage from fighting. 
Damascus has described local agreements - accept state rule or leave - as a ""workable model to bring security and peace"" after more than seven years of war. It says it seeks to restore territory from militants so Syrians can return to their hometowns
The opposition to Assad however says the deals amount to a policy of forced displacement that aims to shore up his rule.
The United Nations aid chief, Stephen O'Brien, voiced ""extreme concern"" over the Daraya evacuation at the time it went ahead. But since then several such withdrawal deals have been struck helping the government recapture major cities across Syria.
The conflict has killed hundreds of thousands of people since 2011 and made nearly 11 million Syrians homeless. 
Hundreds of thousands of people have poured into Syria's northwest corner, the last remaining insurgent stronghold, forced to abandon their homes elsewhere in the country.

The United Nations has also said the displaced should be allowed to ""return voluntarily, in safety and in dignity"".

AZAZ, Syria (Reuters) - In a part of northern Syria that Turkey's army helped rebels capture in 2016, the plunge in value of the Turkish lira has hit shopkeepers, medical charities and fighters paid in the currency hard. 
Turkey has turned from its military role in the rebel-held strip in Syria, that runs along its border between the towns of Afrin and Jarablus, to a longer-term one of stabilization, entwining the area's economy with its own. 
It has funded health and education services, trained local police and more recently joined insurgent factions together into a new armed force.
For those employed by Turkish-backed authorities and paid in lira, including security forces, an international sell-off of the currency, resulting in it losing around 40 percent of its value to the dollar so far this year, has brought new hardship.
The lira has also plunged in value against Syria's official currency, the Damascus-minted Syrian pound.
""The lira was strong in the Syrian territories until two months ago, when it started to lose its strength gradually,"" said Mohammed Hadi Hassano, 25, speaking in his exchange office in the city Azaz, just a few kilometers from the Turkish border.
""800 lira was equal to 100,000 Syrian pounds back then. Today the same amount is equal to only 40,000 pounds."" 
The lira began to weaken rapidly amid concerns over Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's influence on monetary policy, but was driven to record lows over a dispute between the United States and Ankara.
The dispute centers on the fate of a U.S. Christian pastor detained in Turkey on terrorism charges, and which saw Washington slap tariffs on some Turkish imports. 
The Turkish lira's volatility is a new illustration of how the involvement of regional or global powers in Syria's fractured warscape can change things for people on the ground. 
Besides Turkey, Iran, Russia and the United States each have forces deployed in Syria as well as providing other forms of support in territory held by their allies.
""When the Turkish lira began to lose value against the Syrian pound our salaries became worthless,"" said Ghassan Kinno, 23, a fighter with a Free Syrian Army rebel faction in Azaz. 
""The fighter receives his salary and goes to the market... and it's barely enough for one week. This is the reality we are witnessing now. The situation is very difficult and there is no solution,"" he said. 
Another man paid in Turkish lira in Azaz is Mohammed Sheikho, 53, who works for a medical relief organization. 
""I lost an amount of nearly $100 dollars from my (monthly) salary. Who will compensate me for this loss? The merchants who are now raising prices? Or the organization paying my wages?"" He said. His salary was previously worth about $525 a month. 
Local political and military realities mean the lira and its fluctuations may continue to play an important role in Azaz. 

""What is better for us is to be paid in Syrian pounds since we are spending our money in the Syrian territories. But in the end we have to abide by the rules of the side that supports us,"" said Kinno.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia will next month hold its biggest war games in nearly four decades, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Tuesday, a massive military exercise that will also involve the Chinese and Mongolian armies. 
The exercise, called Vostok-2018 (East-2018), will take place in central and eastern Russian military districts and involve almost 300,000 troops, over 1,000 military aircraft, two of Russia's naval fleets, and all its airborne units, Shoigu said in a statement.
The maneuvers will take place at a time of heightened tension between the West and Russia, which is concerned about what it says is an unjustified build-up of the NATO military alliance on its western flank. 
NATO says it has beefed up its forces in eastern Europe to deter potential Russian military action after Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimea in 2014 and backed a pro-Russian uprising in eastern Ukraine.
The war games, which will take place from Sept. 11-15, are likely to displease Japan which has already complained about what it says is a Russian military build-up in the Far East.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is due to attend a forum in Vladivostok over the same period, and a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said on Tuesday Tokyo always paid attention to shifts in Russian-Chinese military cooperation. 
Shoigu said the war games would be the biggest since a Soviet military exercise, Zapad-81 (West-81) in 1981. 
""In some ways they will repeat aspects of Zapad-81, but in other ways the scale will be bigger,"" Shoigu told reporters, while visiting the Russian region of Khakassia.
The Russian Ministry of Defense has said that Chinese and Mongolian military units will also take part in the exercise.
""A MORE ASSERTIVE RUSSIA""
When asked if the cost of holding such a massive military exercise was justified at a time when Russia is faced with higher social spending demands, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said such war games were essential.
""The country's ability to defend itself in the current international situation, which is often aggressive and unfriendly towards our country, means (the exercise) is justified,"" Peskov told reporters on a conference call.
When asked if China's involvement meant Moscow and Beijing were moving towards an alliance, Peskov said it showed that the two allies were cooperating in all areas.
China and Russia have taken part in joint military drills before but not on such a large scale. 
NATO spokesman Dylan White said that Russia had briefed the alliance on the planned exercise in May and that NATO planned to monitor it. Russia had invited military attaches from NATO countries based in Moscow to observe the war games, an offer he said was under consideration. 
""All nations have the right to exercise their armed forces, but it is essential that this is done in a transparent and predictable manner,"" White said in an emailed statement.
""Vostok demonstrates Russia’s focus on exercising large-scale conflict. It fits into a pattern we have seen over some time: a more assertive Russia, significantly increasing its defense budget and its military presence.""
Shoigu this month announced the start of snap combat readiness checks in central and eastern military districts ahead of the planned exercise. 

""Imagine 36,000 armored vehicles - tanks, armored personnel carriers and armored infantry vehicles - moving and working simultaneously, and that all this, naturally, is being tested in conditions as close as possible to military ones,"" Shoigu said on Tuesday.

Tomoyuki Sugimoto, who is believed to be a videographer from Shiga prefecture in central Japan, arrived at Tokyo's Haneda airport on a flight from China, Kyodo and Jiji news agencies said.
Japanese media reports said Sugimoto had apparently been caught filming a military facility in Nampo city. The state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) announced his expulsion at the weekend.
It was unclear when Sugitomo was detained, though Japanese media said in early August that the government was trying to gather information on a man being held in North Korea. 
Japan has demanded that North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons and missile programs and has also sought the return of citizens kidnapped by the isolated state during the 1970s and 1980s.
It has said it will not provide economic aid to Pyongyang until that issue is resolved and normal diplomatic ties established.
In its annual defense white paper, published earlier on Tuesday, Japan said North Korea still posed a dire threat to its security despite a half to ballistic missile tests and a pledge by leader Kim Jong Un to denuclearize the Korean peninsula.

Mahathir's comments were a setback for Chinese developer Country Garden Holdings Co Ltd as it tries to revive faltering demand in the project on Malaysia's southern tip.
""We will form a committee to study and review whatever terms that were agreed to previously,"" Housing and Local Government Minister Zuraida Kamaruddin told a press conference.
""We will engage with all the agencies involved and also the developer. Then we see what is the best way forward,"" the minister said.
Shares in Hong Kong-listed Country Garden, China's largest property developer by sales, fell as much as 3.5 percent in early trade on Tuesday following Mahathir's announcement.
Mahathir had also said Malaysia would not give visas for foreigners to live in Forest City.
The Forest City project, which is envisaged to eventually house 700,000 people on reclaimed land near Singapore, has faced uncertainty since Mahathir's coalition won a shock victory at a May general election.
The project, along with several other infrastructure mega-projects backed by Chinese money, became fodder for Mahathir's election campaign when he tapped into public displeasure over a perceived over-dependence on Chinese capital.
In a statement on Tuesday, the prime minister's office said purchase of properties by foreigners in Malaysia does not guarantee automatic residency in the country. 
The statement, however, did not make a reference to the Forest City development.
""The government reiterates that it welcomes foreign direct investment that contributes to the transfer of technology, provides employment for locals and the setting up of industries,"" Mahathir's office said. 
Since becoming prime minister in May, Mahathir has put the brakes on China-backed projects worth over $20 billion, including a massive rail project.
Country Garden Pacificview Sdn Bhd, a joint venture between Country Garden and the Johor state government to develop Forest City, said in a statement on Monday that Mahathir's comments ""may have been taken out of context"".
The company said Mahathir had responded positively during a meeting two weeks ago with Country Garden chairman, Yeung Kwok Keung, and that the company has complied with all necessary regulations in developing the project.

572,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>",Italy's anti-migrant stance puts EU Mediterranean mission at risk,"By Gabriela Baczynska
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Italy has threatened to bar ships of the EU naval force from bringing migrants picked up in the Mediterranean to its ports unless the bloc comes up with ways to share the burden of taking them in, officials in Brussels said.
Diplomats were meeting in Brussels on Tuesday over the latest migration threat from Italy, whose new populist government has already kept several rescue ships with hundreds of migrants on board stuck at sea for days.
European Union officials say Rome gave the EU until the end of August to come up with a clear relocation scheme for migrants picked from the sea by ships from the Operation Sophia joint naval force, or it will no longer allow them into its ports. 
Any swift agreement on hosting people from Operation Sophia ships by other EU states is unlikely. EU states have been unable to agree on migration policy since migrants and refugees from the Middle East and Africa began arriving in huge numbers.
Italy, where more than 650,000 people arrived across the sea since 2014, has felt increasingly overwhelmed and left alone by its peers. Elections this year gave victory to parties campaigning on an anti-immigration platform.
One EU official said the worst-case scenario would be that Operation Sophia ships stay in ports. 
Others said that was unlikely as the mission's mandate ran until the end of the year and EU states were generally in favor of keeping it afloat. They said a fudge was hence more likely.
Unless a solution emerges, the ball would be back in Rome's court to see if it is willing to follow through with its threat.
Operation Sophia currently has four ships in the Mediterranean as well as planes and helicopters to watch out for people-smuggling across the sea.
Under international law, vessels are obliged to help people in distress and Operation Sophia ships have so far mostly delivered those rescued to Italian ports.
While only some 70,000 people made it to the EU across the Mediterranean this year - a fraction of the more than one million arrivals in the record 2015 - migration still dominates European politics.
EU defense ministers will also discuss the issue when they meet in Vienna this Wednesday and Thursday.

573,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2018 06:43AM ET</span>",Iran parliament censures Rouhani in sign pragmatists losing sway,"By Bozorgmehr Sharafedin
LONDON (Reuters) - Iran's parliament voted on Tuesday to reject President Hassan Rouhani's explanations for economic hardship after a dramatic grilling on live TV, a sign his pragmatic faction is losing sway to hardline rivals as new U.S. sanctions begin to bite.
The vote in parliament came two days after lawmakers sacked the minister of economy and finance and weeks after they sacked the labor minister, blaming them for the collapse of the rial currency and surging inflation.
Rouhani won two landslide elections on a platform of economic reform and opening Iran up to the outside world, and his pragmatic supporters have a majority in the parliament. But his reputation and political influence have taken a sharp hit as his promised economic gains have failed to materialize.
His highest profile achievement was to negotiate the lifting of financial sanctions on Iran in a 2015 deal with world powers over its nuclear program, but U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out in May and Washington has re-imposed sanctions.
Rouhani spoke out in parliament in defense of his economic record, blaming the country's woes on the U.S. sanctions rather than his team's management. But a majority of lawmakers voted to reject his explanation in four out of five areas.
There were conflicting reports about what would follow from the vote: several Iranian news agencies said Rouhani's case would now be referred to the judiciary, although the spokesman for the parliamentary leadership, Behrouz Nemati, said lawmakers must hold further discussion before that would take place.
The action in parliament is a further sign of how the Trump administration's decision to re-impose sanctions could affect Iran's leadership and its relationship with the outside world, potentially for decades to come.
Iran's rulers have been divided between a pragmatic faction that aims for better international relations, and hardliners who are wary of reforms. Trump's decision to abandon the nuclear deal was opposed by U.S. allies in Europe, who argued that he undermined Rouhani and strengthened the hands of the hardliners.
While Rouhani and his cabinet run Iran's day-to-day affairs, ultimate authority lies with the Supreme Leader, 79-year-old Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in power since 1989. Weakening the pragmatists now could affect the choice of Khamenei's successor.
For now, Rouhani's own position appears safe. The judiciary could determine that he broke the law and parliament has the power to impeach him, but experts on Iranian politics say power struggles are more likely to play out indirectly.
""The parliament's move is politically motivated and indicates that tensions would increase in the Islamic Republic in coming months,"" Saeed Laylaz, an Iranian economist, told Reuters by telephone from Tehran.
""Iranian political factions have always used international issues to pursue their domestic gains,"" he added.
After the sacking of the two ministers this month, Tasnim news agency reported that 70 lawmakers had signed a motion to impeach a third: the Minister of Industry, Mines and Business.
Rouhani has bowed to pressure and fired the head of the central bank. A deputy central bank governor was arrested by the judiciary on corruption charges in a crackdown that also saw foreign exchange dealers rounded up.
""U.S. PLOT""
The lawmakers asked Rouhani on Tuesday about five subjects: unemployment, slow economic growth, the fall of the rial, cross-border smuggling, and the lack of access by Iranian banks to global financial services. The parliament found only Rouhani's answer about banks satisfactory.
""I want to assure the Iranian nation that we will not allow the U.S. plot against the Islamic Republic to succeed,"" Rouhani told parliament. ""We will not let this bunch of anti-Iranians in the White House be able to plot against us."" 
Iran's official unemployment rate is 12 percent, with youth unemployment as high as 25 percent in a country where 60 percent of the 80 million population is under 30. The rial has lost more than two-thirds of its value in a year.
Iran's economy has suffered not only from sanctions but also from pervasive corruption and the concentration of its wealth and trade in the hands of big firms controlled by the hardline Revolutionary Guards military force.
Washington imposed a new round of sanctions in August targeting Iran’s trade in gold and other precious metals, its purchases of U.S. dollars and its car industry. Worse is yet to come, with a new round of sanctions to be imposed in November that Washington says aims to cut Iran's oil exports to zero.
The plunge in the currency and soaring inflation have sparked sporadic demonstrations against profiteering and corruption, with many protesters chanting slogans against both the government and Supreme Leader Khamenei.
Rouhani said such anti-government protests had encouraged Trump to try to provoke more unrest by harming Iran's economy.
""The protests tempted Trump to withdraw from the nuclear deal,"" he said, asking lawmakers to support his cabinet and not add to anti-government sentiment.

Although the economic problems were critical, Rouhani said: ""More important than that is that many people have lost their faith in the future of the Islamic Republic and are in doubt about its power.""

574,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2018 06:30AM ET</span>",Number of Somalis evicted from their homes doubles in first half of 2018: report,"By Cecilie Kallestrup
NAIROBI (Reuters) - The number of Somalis left homeless has surged this year as thousands who had already fled war, drought and floods were forcibly evicted from mostly makeshift homes, the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said. 
The aid group, in a report published on Tuesday, said one of the main factors driving people out of their homes was property developers requisitioning land, often without warning, during a building boom in the capital Mogadishu. 
More than 200,000 Somalis, or one in 60 of the population, were forcibly evicted from their homes in January-July, more than double the number in the same period last year, the group said.
NRC said most evictions were done without due process, including without prior notice, and called on the government to address the problem by developing land policies and improving access to land for people who were forced from their homes. 
Many had fled to urban areas after being displaced by natural disasters and conflict in other parts of the country. 
The aid group said Somali authorities and landowners were evicting people from public and private land mainly in battle-scarred Mogadishu, which is seeing a building boom.
""These people are already in a vulnerable position. They have nowhere to go,"" Evelyn Aero, NRC's adviser for information, counseling and legal assistance, said.
Somali government officials were not immediately available to comment.
A farmer with eight children who was interviewed by the NRC said she was not at home in Mogadishu when her family was forced out. 
""I came back to see my children on the street,"" said Halimo Sidow, who had fled drought last year in the Lower Shabelle region in southern Somalia. 
A devastating drought last year and this year's floods forced ""a massive migration to urban areas"", NRC said.
Somalia is also struggling to recover from more than 25 years of civil war and an ongoing battle between its federal government and Islamist insurgents, but is starting to attract investment again from Somalis living abroad.
They send back home $2.3 billion annually and some of that cash - as well as hundreds of millions of dollars in aid - has been financing the construction of hotels, commercial buildings and houses in the capital of Mogadishu. 

In 2017, the United Nations estimated that more than half the population of 12 million needed food aid. A similar drought in 2011, exacerbated by years of war that began in 1991, sparked the world's last famine, which killed 260,000 people.

(Reuters) - A federal court ruled on Monday that North Carolina Republicans illegally drew up U.S. congressional districts in the state to benefit their party, suggesting that new lines be crafted before November's election.
The three-judge panel for the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina said in a 321-page opinion that Republican legislators responsible for the map conducted unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering to dilute the impact of Democratic votes.
“That is precisely what the Republican-controlled North Carolina General Assembly sought to do here,"" the opinion said.
The panel gave parties until Thursday to file their recommendations to fix the problem.
The decision could have national implications in this November's battle for control of Congress. Democrats need to pick up 23 seats to gain a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives that could thwart Republican President Donald Trump's legislative agenda.
Among the suggestions from the judges were holding state nominating primaries in November with new district lines that remove illegal partisan bias and then holding a general election before the new U.S. Congress is seated in January 2019.
The North Carolina dispute centered on a congressional redistricting plan adopted by the Republican-led legislature in 2016 after a court found that Republican lawmakers improperly used race as a factor when redrawing certain U.S. House districts after the 2010 census.
The Republican lawmaker in charge of the plan said it was crafted to maintain Republican dominance because ""electing Republicans is better than electing Democrats.""
Party officials were not immediately available for comment on the court's decision.
North Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Wayne Goodwin said the decision ""is a monumental and necessary line in the sand stating that politicians cannot choose their voters by silencing other voters.""
Republicans in 2016 won 10 of the 13 House districts - 77 percent of them - despite getting just 53 percent of the statewide vote, nearly the same result as in 2014.
In June, the U.S. Supreme Court threw out a lower court ruling that Republicans drew the boundaries to ensure electoral victories for their party.
But the justices sent the case back to the federal three-judge panel to reconsider whether the plaintiffs, including a group of Democratic voters, had the necessary legal standing to sue in the case. 

""North Carolina’s gerrymandering was one of the most brazen in the nation, where state legislative leaders proudly pronounced it a partisan gerrymander,"" Rick Hasen, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, wrote on his election law blog.

NEW DELHI/ALAPPUZHA (Reuters) - More than a week after the floodwater began subsiding, animal carcasses are still floating in Kerala's backwaters, and in places a nauseating stench rises like a wall when the wake from a passing boat breaks the surface.
   These inland lagoons running parallel to the coast are one of the biggest tourist draws in India's most southwesterly state, but the stain of death and devastation wrought by Kerala's worst flood in a century will take longer than a season to wash away.
   The quaint towns and villages scattered between the lush forests and paddy fields bordering the backwaters are now communities in despair.
    Houses in low-lying areas are still submerged, roads are waterlogged and the sewage from drains have washed into channels that are too slow-moving to effectively flush out the effluent.
    Sudarsanan T.K., a houseboat owner in the town of Alappuzha, had been looking forward to the peak tourist season, but as his home disappeared under 2.5 meters (eight foot) of water his family now have to live aboard the boat he would otherwise be renting to tourists from Europe, China, Malaysia and India.  
   ""I've nothing left, but this houseboat. I don't know how I can repay my bank loan in this condition. The bank may take back my boat. I will have nothing at all then,""  Sudarsanan, a 64-year-old father of two, told Reuters.
    Some 1,500 houseboats are tied up at Alappuzha, going nowhere, with many of the owners still paying off loans taken to buy the boats.
   Sudarsanan owes about $8,600 on the loan taken eight years ago to buy the boat, and he could have earned up to $7,000 by December if the deluge hadn't washed away his hopes. 
   Hundreds of people perished in the flood and more than one million of Kerala's 35 million people were forced to abandon their homes and take shelter in relief camps.
    Blessed with natural beauty, fertile land and bountiful seas, Kerala has been dubbed ""God's own country"" by its people, but the Marxists running the state government reckon it will need $3.57 billion to rebuild over the next two years.
    ""Kerala's GDP growth may fall by 2 percent,"" state Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac told Reuters, forecasting growth of 6 percent for the financial year ending next March.
    Crops have been lost, the construction industry was dead for a month, and tourism, which contributes 10 percent of the state's economy but accounts for about 25 percent of jobs creation, has been badly hit.
    
    FESTIVAL WASHOUT
    For discerning tourists looking for a more laidback Indian experience, Kerala has it all - long sandy beaches, lazy waterways, charming, historic towns like Kochi and the cool, forested hills of the Western Ghats.
    Kerala doesn't draw numbers like the northern tourist circuit, the so-called ""Golden Triangle"" running from New Delhi to the Taj Mahal in Agra, and Jaipur's palaces in the desert state of Rajasthan, but it has carved out a sizable niche.
    Last year, one million foreigners visited Kerala, along with 15 million domestic tourists, but state government and industry officials reckon the flood will result in losses for the tourism sector of $357 million.
    The floods struck just as Kerala was gearing up for Onam, the harvest festival which is one of the highlights of the state's cultural calendar. 
    Festivities, including the spectacular Vallam Kali races involving traditional war canoes, some manned by more than 100 paddlers, were postponed.
    ""Kerala has lost out on one of the best seasons, as the calamity struck during the 10-day run up to Onam,"" said Ranjini Nambiar, who heads a travel consultancy.
    Thousands of volunteers have joined a clean-up campaign mounted by the state, and Shilendran M., an executive with the CGH Earth luxury hotel chain, expected some kind of order to be restored within the next few weeks.
    ""The state administration is working on a war footing,""  said Shilendran, whose group has more than a dozen properties in Kerala. ""We are limping back to normal.""
    Hardly anywhere in the state escaped the calamity. 
    Ernakulam district, the biggest industrial and tourism contributor to Kerala's economy and home to the historic city of Kochi, suffered major damage, and its busy international airport was shut for nearly two weeks.
    Munnar, a hill resort overlooking the tea and cardamom plantations high in the Ghats was cut off, as bridges were washed away and landslides blocked roads.
    Once every dozen years a bright purplish-blue bell-shaped flower called the Neelakurinji, blossoms on the slopes around Munnar - and this was one of those years.
    The state tourism had marketed 2018 as the Kurunji year, but people in Kerala are more likely to remember the mud.

The letter was delivered directly to U.S Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and stated that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's government felt that the process could not move forward.
""The U.S. is still not ready to meet (North Korean) expectations in terms of taking a step forward to sign a peace treaty,"" CNN reported, citing sources. https://cnn.it/2MAI9AT
The 1950-1953 Korean War ended in an armistice rather than a peace treaty, leaving U.S.-led U.N. forces technically still at war with North Korea.
The North has long made clear that it sees an official end to the state of war as crucial to lowering tensions on the Korean peninsula.
The United States has been reluctant to declare an end to the Korean War until after North Korea abandons its nuclear weapons program.
The Washington Post reported on Monday that U.S. President Donald Trump called off a visit to North Korea by Pompeo after the latter received a belligerent letter from a senior North Korean official just hours after the trip was announced last week.
CNN reported that the letter was sent by the former head of North Korea's spy agency, Kim Yong Chol, but it was not known how it was sent. The Washington Post said North Korea had been increasingly communicating through its U.N. mission.
CNN reported that the letter also mentioned that if a compromise could not be reached and the nascent talks crumbles, North Korea could resume ""nuclear and missile activities"".
On Sunday, North Korea's state media accused the United States of ""double-dealing"" and ""hatching a criminal plot"" but did not mention Pompeo's canceled visit. 
The Washington Post said the exact contents of the message were unclear, but it was sufficiently belligerent that Trump and Pompeo decided to call off the planned trip.
The trip had been announced the previous day for this week and Pompeo had intended to introduce a newly named special envoy, Stephen Biegun, to his North Korean counterparts.
The White House referred queries on the Washington Post report to the State Department, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In cancelling Pompeo's trip, Trump publicly acknowledged for the first time that his effort to get North Korea to denuclearize had stalled since his June 12 summit with its leader, Kim Jong Un {nL2N1VF10N]

U.S. intelligence and defense officials have repeatedly expressed doubts about North Korea's willingness to give up its nuclear weapons and did not expect Pompeo's trip to yield positive results.

The investigators called for the U.N. Security Council to impose an arms embargo on Myanmar, subject its officials to targeted sanctions, and set up an ad hoc tribunal to try suspects or refer them to the International Criminal Court in the Hague.
But China has close relations with Myanmar, and has backed what Myanmar officials call a legitimate counter-insurgency operation in the western state of Rakhine. Beijing has helped to block a resolution on the crisis at the U.N. Security Council in the past.
Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying, when asked about the report, told a regular news briefing that the historical, religious and ethnic background of the Rakhine issue was ""extremely complex"".
""I think that unilateral criticism or exerting pressure is actually not helpful to resolving the problem,"" Hua said. 
A year ago, Myanmar government troops led a crackdown in Rakhine State in response to attacks by Rohingya insurgents on 30 police posts and a military base. 
Some 700,000 Rohingya fled the crackdown and most are now living in refugee camps in neighbouring Bangladesh.
Hua said Myanmar and Bangladesh had recently made positive progress in talks, in an apparent reference to an agreement to complete the voluntary repatriation of the refugees within two years.
""Under these circumstances the international community should continue to play a constructive role in promoting Myanmar and Bangladesh appropriately resolving the Rakhine State issue via dialogue and consultations,"" Hua said. 

The U.N. investigators said in their report that the Myanmar military action was ""grossly disproportionate to actual security threats"", and they blamed civilian government leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, for failing to use her ""moral authority"" to protect civilians.

May's comment, made to reporters as she headed to Africa to boost Britain's trade ties ahead of Brexit in March 2019, came after her finance minister Philip Hammond said last week that a no-deal departure from the EU would damage public finances.
Ahead of her arrival in South Africa, May said the forecasts cited by Hammond were out of date. 
""I think when they came out I was very clear on a previous trip that those figures were a work in progress at that particular time,"" she said according to Sky.
She repeated comments from the head of the World Trade Organization (WTO) that Britain leaving the EU without a deal ""would not be a walk in the park"" but that ""it would not be the end of the world"", Sky said.
Hammond was criticized by some lawmakers in May's deeply divided Conservative Party for saying last week -- on the day the government published contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit -- that such a scenario could mean borrowing would be about 80 billion pounds ($102.02 billion) a year higher in 15 years' time as the economy grew more slowly.
May is hoping to a agree ""business-friendly"" deal with the bloc on the key issue of trade which has split her party between those who want a definitive break from the EU, and those, like Hammond, who want to keep close ties.
However, in her comments to reporters on her way to Africa, May repeated her warning that a no-deal Brexit was better than leaving with a bad deal.

""I think it's absolutely that the government is preparing for no deal because we don't know what the outcome is going to be,"" she said.

KAUBER, West Bank (Reuters) - The Israeli military on Tuesday demolished the family home of a Palestinian teenager in the occupied West Bank who killed an Israeli in a Jewish settlement a month ago and was shot dead in the attack.
Footage distributed by the military showed an armoured bulldozer tearing into the one-storey structure in the village of Kauber, north of the Palestinian city of Ramallah.
Mohammed Tareq Ibraham Dar Youssef, 17, broke into the settlement of Adam on July 26, and stabbed three people, killing Yotam Ovadia, 31. One of those wounded in the assault fatally shot the Palestinian, the military said.
Dar Youssef's uncle, Khaled Abu Ayyoush, said the youth's parents, two brothers and two sisters had lived in the house razed in the night-time operation. The family, he said, had known nothing of his intention to carry out an attack.
""Why are they at fault? Israel's continued policy of collective punishment is merciless,"" Abu Ayyoush said.
Israel's Supreme Court has upheld the demolition policy, which Israeli officials have termed both punitive and a deterrence to potential attackers.
In a statement, the military said dozens of Palestinians hurled rocks, firebombs and pipe bombs at troops who deployed in the village and that they responded with ""riot dispersal means"". It said none of the soldiers was hurt. There were no immediate reports of any Palestinian injuries.
""We entered tonight to close a circle and we destroyed the terrorist's home,"" Lieutenant-Colonel Liron Appleman, a battalion commander, said at the scene in the video clip provided by the military.
Although stabbings and car-rammings carried out by Palestinians since late 2015 have become less frequent in the West Bank, tensions have remained high in the aftermath of U.S. President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in December.
Palestinians seek to establish a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip with East Jerusalem as its capital, and say Israel's expansion of settlements in occupied territory could deny them a viable and contiguous country.
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks collapsed in 2014.

588,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2018 04:20AM ET</span>",Philippines' Duterte hit by new ICC complaint over deadly drug war,"By Manuel Mogato and Martin Petty
MANILA (Reuters) - Activists and families of eight victims of the Philippines' ""war on drugs"" filed a complaint on Tuesday with the International Criminal Court (ICC), a second petition accusing President Rodrigo Duterte of murder and crimes against humanity.
The 50-page complaint calls for Duterte's indictment over thousands of alleged extrajudicial killings during his crackdown on drugs, which the activists and families said included ""brazen"" executions by police acting with impunity. 
Critics of the campaign were being ""persecuted"", they said, and cases filed by victims' families had gone nowhere.
The latest move is led by a network of activists, priests and members of the poor, urban communities that have borne the brunt of a fierce two-year campaign in which police have killed about 4,400 people, causing international alarm.
""Duterte is personally liable for ordering state police to undertake mass killings,"" Neri Colmenares, a lawyer representing the group, told reporters.
Duterte insists he told police to kill only in self-defense and has lashed out at critics while demonstrating no remorse for the deaths. In a national address last month, he said the drugs war would be remain ""relentless and chilling"".
Benigno Durana, a national police spokesman, said the only order Duterte gave to police was ""to wage war on drugs and criminality within the bounds of the law"".
The ICC petition, known as a communication, follows a similar complaint filed in April 2017 by a Philippine lawyer and backed by two opposition lawmakers, into which the ICC in February started a preliminary examination.
Human rights groups believe the death toll could be far higher than the one the police give, and accuse law enforcement of summarily executing suspected drug users and small-time dealers, using only cursory intelligence. Police reject that.
PETITION 'DOOMED'
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said the latest petition was ""doomed"", because the Philippines' was no longer covered by the ICC's Rome Statute.
Duterte unilaterally withdrew in March from the ICC's founding treaty, saying it skirted due process and presumption of his innocence and sought to portray him as a ""ruthless and heartless violator of human rights"". 
He even threatened to arrest ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda if she were to comes to the Philippines to investigate him, and said he would convince other countries to follow him in quitting the ICC.
It was a stark contrast from the early days of Duterte's presidency, when he had routinely disparaged the ICC and dared it to go after him, expressing his readiness to go on trial in The Hague and ""rot in jail"". 
Opposition lawmakers maintain that Duterte's withdrawal from the treaty, which takes effect in March 2019, was illegal because it was done without Senate approval. 
They have challenged it at the Supreme Court, which started hearing oral arguments on Tuesday.
Jurist groups say that regardless of how the court rules, Duterte is not protected from a possible indictment because the alleged crimes took place while the Philippines was a member of the ICC, and therefore covered by its jurisdiction.
Duterte also maintains the Philippines never actually acceded to the Rome Statute in 2011, because it was not published in the country's official gazette. 
The ICC is a court of last resort that can exercise jurisdiction if states are unable or unwilling to investigate crimes, which Duterte's spokesman said was not the case in the Philippines.
Kristina Conti, another lawyer backing the complaint, said it had been filed before the ICC because as a serving president, Duterte had immunity from legal action. 

The ICC prosecutor's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment and could not be reached out of normal office hours.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Air strikes by the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen's war have caused heavy civilian casualties at marketplaces, weddings and on fishing boats, some of which may amount to war crimes, United Nations human rights experts said on Tuesday.
Saudi Arabia is leading a Western-backed alliance of Sunni Muslim Arab states trying to restore the internationally recognized government of Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, ousted from the capital Sanaa by the Iran-aligned Houthis in 2015.
Fighters of the Houthi movement have fired missiles into Saudi Arabia, blocked delivery of supplies to Taiz and shelled the strategic city from the highlands, the panel said. They have also committed torture, a war crime, it said.
Coalition forces have imposed severe restrictions on Red Sea ports and Sanaa airport, depriving Yemenis of vital supplies which may also constitute international crimes, the independent experts said in their first report to the Human Rights Council.
The coalition's additional inspection procedures at Hodeidah port have had a ""chilling effect on commercial shipping"", although no U.N. or coalition searches had discovered weapons being smuggled into Yemen where 8.4 million people are on the brink of famine, it said. 
""Coalition air strikes have caused most of the documented civilian casualties. In the past three years, such air strikes have hit residential areas, markets, funerals, weddings, detention facilities, civilian boats and even medical facilities,"" the panel said.
Its investigation of 11 incidents raised ""serious concerns about the targeting process applied by the coalition"". Strikes that fail to spare people or structures protected by international humanitarian law would be unlawful violations.
""Individuals in the (Yemeni) government and the coalition, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, may have conducted attacks in violation of the principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution that may amount to war crimes,"" the experts said, adding that they had compiled a confidential list of suspects.
There was no immediate reaction from those governments, which received an advance copy of the report from the United Nations.
All sides have conscripted children between 11 and 17 years and used them to participate in the hostilities, also war crimes, the 41-page report said.
It was released ahead of U.N. peace talks between the government and Houthis on Sept. 6 in Geneva.

The panel, headed by Tunisian expert Kamel Jendoubi, neither specifically referred to the United States and Britain, which provide arms and intelligence to the Saudi-led alliance, nor did it point a finger at Iranian support to the Houthis.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The plight of a lonely dolphin and dozens of penguins that have been abandoned in a derelict aquarium in Japan since the start of the year sparked protests this week, with activists and ordinary Japanese alike calling for the animals to be saved.
The female bottlenose dolphin, nicknamed Honey, was captured in 2005 near Taiji, a western port town that has become notorious for its annual dolphin hunt that was featured in the Oscar-winning 2009 documentary ""The Cove"", media reports say.
The practice of Japanese aquariums buying dolphins from Taiji came under heavy criticism following the release of the film. The hunt involves driving hundreds of dolphins into a cove, where some are taken alive for sale to marine parks, while others are killed for meat. The Japan Association of Zoos and Aquariums has since agreed to stop buying dolphins from Taiji. 
The operator of the Inubosaki Marine Park Aquarium in the city of Choshi in Chiba prefecture, just east of Tokyo, shuttered the facility in January citing a decline in visitors after the 2011 earthquake and nuclear crisis.
Honey and 46 penguins, along with hundreds of fish and reptiles, remain at the aquarium, an official with the Chiba prefectural Health and Welfare department said.
Employees have been regularly feeding the animals, he added, but photos and video taken by activists in March and August from outside the park show Honey floating in a tiny pool in an eerily empty facility. In another picture, dust-covered penguins can be seen perched on a crumbling structure near a pile of debris.
""Honey is a symbol of both the problem of marine parks and Taiji's hunting practices,"" said Akiko Mitsunobu, chief of aquarium issues for Animal Rights Center, a local group.
""When we went to check on the facility, she was showing signs of stress, putting her head weakly in and out of the water.""
Repeated calls to Inubosaki Marine Park and its parent company went unanswered. A Choshi city official said they have also been unable to reach park representatives.
""I get feelings of danger and doubt from the fact that they are so silent about this,"" said Sachiko Azuma, a representative of local activist group PEACE (Put an End to Animal Cruelty and Exploitation). 
""As a group that handles animals, they have a responsibility to explain what they intend to do with Honey and the other animals.""
News of the abandoned animals spread quickly over social media, with Twitter users posting photos captioned ""Save Honey"". A resort hotel's offer to give them a new home sparked a flood of retweets.

""I beg the authorities to get in close contact with each other and push ahead with this,"" wrote one Twitter user.

The lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community is routinely persecuted in Muslim-majority Malaysia, where sodomy is a crime and is seen as a threat to conservative values.
The women had plead guilty to charges under Islamic laws forbidding lesbian sex. They were sentenced to a fine and six strokes of the cane, with the punishment to be carried out on Aug. 28.
The case had sparked an outcry with civil rights groups decrying the caning as torture.
The Shariah High Court in Terengganu, however, postponed the punishment to Sept. 3 due to ""technical reasons"", media said.
""A few agencies will be involved in the punishment, and there are some technical issues that have yet to be resolved,"" court registrar Nurul Huda Abdul Rahman was quoted as saying by English-language daily The Star.
Reuters could not reach court officials involved in the case by telephone to seek a comment.
Civil rights groups say intolerance towards the LGBT community in Malaysia has been increasing in recent months.
A transgender woman was brutally beaten up by a group of assailants in Seremban, south of Kuala Lumpur on Aug. 15, in what activists said was part of a growing hostility towards gay and transgender people in Malaysia.
Authorities removed the portraits of two LGBT activists from a public photography exhibition earlier this month, saying they promoted LGBT activities.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - The opposition presidential candidate in the Maldives said
he did not expect September's election to be free and fair but trusted voters to decide on his challenge to President Abdulla Yameen, who imposed a state of emergency this year.
Yameen is seeking a second five-year term in the tropical tourist paradise riven by political instability since a police mutiny forced its first democratically-elected leader, Mohamed Nasheed, to quit in 2012.
The Indian Ocean archipelago of 400,000 people has faced upheavals since February, when Yameen imposed the emergency to annul a Supreme Court ruling that quashed the convictions of nine opposition leaders, including Nasheed.
Veteran lawmaker ""Ibu"" Mohamed Solih, who is challenging Yameen in a coalition led by the main opposition Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), spoke to 400 citizens resident in Sri Lanka on Monday.
""We are very worried about the situation,"" Solih, who was first elected to parliament in 1994, told reporters in Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital, ahead of his campaign meet.
Asked if he expected the election to be free and fair, he replied ""No,"" but added that the opposition placed ""very much trust"" in voters in its battle against the government.
Solih's party estimates about 30,000 Maldivians live in Sri Lanka, forming one of the largest blocs of overseas voters. 
The opposition has accused the Maldives government of locking up most of the leaders who could challenge Yameen's bid for re-election, a charge the government denies.
""We are also very aware that President Yameen is going to rig it as much as he can,"" Nasheed, who also attended the meeting, said, referring to the election.
""But when people come overwhelmingly, there is very little he can do. We are going to win this election.""
Responding to Solih's remarks, the Maldives ambassador to Sri Lanka, Mohamed Hussain Shareef, said, ""The opposition is crying foul as an exit strategy and ploy to save face internationally for when they are eventually defeated."" 
A spokesman for Yameen did not immediately respond to telephone calls from Reuters to seek comment.
Nasheed, convicted of terrorism charges in 2015 and sentenced to 13 years in prison after a controversial and widely criticized trial, was the sole candidate when the MDP held a primary election in May.

The opposition parties fielded Solih after the Maldives election commission ruled that Nasheed, who lives in exile in Sri Lanka, was not eligible to run in September.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia released 14 government critics on Tuesday, in a move by Prime Minister Hun Sen that some observers say is aimed at appeasing foreign criticism of a flawed general election last month.
The 14, who are all members or supporters of Cambodia's now dissolved main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), were released from Phnom Penh's Prey Sar prison.
They were convicted in 2014 of insurrection after they forcibly tried to reopen the country's only designated protest venue, ""Freedom Park"", in July that year and were handed jail terms ranging from seven to 20 years.
The convictions were widely criticized as politically motivated.
""We have been waiting a long time to see Cambodians really reconcile as a nation with democratic principles and respect for human rights,"" Meach Sovannara, one of the 14, told reporters after police dropped him off at his home in Phnom Penh.
Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party (CPP) swept all parliamentary seats in last month's largely unopposed election. 
But rights groups said the July 29 vote was neither free nor fair given the absence of a significant challenger to Hun Sen, who has ruled Cambodia for 33 years.
Hun Sen has requested pardons for 23 people since Aug. 17.
Sebastian Strangio, author of the book ""Hun Sen's Cambodia"", said the pardons served a dual function of easing domestic political tensions and presenting Western critics with some marginal signs of democratic progress.
""This does not signify any substantial change in Hun Sen's mentality,"" Strangio told Reuters.
""If the CPP faces a serious challenge before the next election, history suggests that Hun Sen will do whatever he needs to do in order to maintain his hold on power,"" he added.

Government spokesman Phay Siphan said that the recent pardons were a ""humanitarian"" act by Hun Sen and not a response to international criticism.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan said on Tuesday North Korea still posed a dire threat to its security despite a halt to ballistic missile tests and a pledge by leader Kim Jong Un to denuclearize the Korean peninsula.
""North Korea's military activities pose the most serious and pressing threat our nation has faced,"" said an annual white paper published on Tuesday by Japan's Ministry of Defence.
The document outlines security concerns about nuclear-armed North Korea, China's growing military might and territorial ambitions, and Russia's intent to rebuild its power that paint a picture of Japan surrounded by potential adversaries in East Asia.
The latest security assessment also comes after U.S. President Donald Trump abruptly canceled a planned fourth trip by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Pyongyang this week as part of a fresh bid to push North Korea to abandon nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles following the unprecedented summit between Trump and Kim in Singapore in June. 
Trump hailed his meeting with Kim as a success and agreed to halt joint military exercises with South Korea. The North Korean leader reiterated an earlier pledge to work toward removing nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula.
However, negotiations have since ground to a halt with Washington demanding tangible steps and Pyongyang asking for U.S. concessions first. 
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said since the Singapore meeting that his country would not change its military stance toward its belligerent neighbor until it saw concrete, irreversible and verifiable steps toward disarmament.
""We need to keep a careful watch on North Korea to see what concrete action it takes to abandon its nuclear weapons and missiles,"" the Japanese defense paper said. 
It noted that North Korea had conducted three nuclear tests and fired 40 ballistic missiles since the start of 2016, some of which have passed over Japan. 
North Korea has derided Abe's government as a ""cult"" bent on derailing Pyongyang's diplomatic outreach in recent state media comments. State-run newspapers, which once slammed Trump, have recently switched to praising the U.S. leader.
Japan said last month it planned to buy two Aegis Ashore air defense radar tracking stations from the United States to bolster its defense against North Korean missiles. The equipment, which will be deployed along with interceptor missile batteries, could also be turned against any potential threat from China from 2023 onwards.

""As Chinese power grows, its military strength is rapidly burgeoning,"" the white paper said.

""It's a crisis that's been growing for some time in Venezuela and we of course look at it with deep concern,"" Sanchez said at a news conference in Santiago with Chile's President Sebastian Pinera, a fierce critic of Maduro.
But Sanchez stressed that Spain, which once colonized most of Latin America, had no intention of interfering in internal affairs in the region.
""Venezuela has to start a dialogue with itself...to find a solution to this political crisis. And of course, the international community must accompany that dialogue,"" Sanchez said. ""I guarantee Spain will be very active in that.""
Several countries in Latin America, including Chile, Peru, Mexico, Argentina and Brazil, have called on Maduro to enact democratic reforms and accept international humanitarian aid to stem a growing exodus of Venezuelans across the region.
On Friday, the United Nations migration agency said the situation was building toward a ""crisis moment"" comparable to events involving refugees in the Mediterranean. [nL8N1VF4PU]
In recent weeks, Ecuador and Peru have tightened their entry requirements for Venezuelans, and an angry mob in Brazil drove a group of migrants back across the border. [nL2N1VE1E2]

All content on family planning has been dropped in a draft civil code being deliberated by top lawmakers on Monday, the Procuratorate Daily wrote in a post on its Weibo account. 
China has loosened its family planning policy as its population grays, birth rates slow and its workforce declines. In 2016, the government allowed couples in urban areas to have two children, replacing a one-child policy enforced since 1979. 
The draft civil code also includes a one-month ""cooling off"" period in which couples filing for divorce can withdraw their case. 
Revisions to the draft civil code will be submitted to China's annual parliamentary meeting in March 2020. 
Speculation that China may further ease its two-child policy was sparked early this month when China Post unveiled the design of a stamp for release next year that features a family of two pigs and three cheerful piglets.
Debate on the policy was further stoked after two Chinese researchers proposed forcing couples with fewer than two children to pay into a ""procreation fund"", an idea that was widely criticized.

602,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2018 09:40PM ET</span>",Brazil's top court to rule in September on Lula plea for freedom,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's Supreme Court will weigh in September an appeal by jailed former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to be set free so he can join the presidential campaign already under way, a court spokesperson said on Monday.
Lula was jailed in April to start serving a 12-year sentence on a corruption conviction that will almost certainly disqualify him from running in the October election. He has appealed an earlier decision by a Supreme Court justice who rejected a habeas corpus writ his lawyers had filed seeking his release.
The full 11-member court will now rule on the appeal by electronic vote between Sept. 7 and 13, the spokesperson said.
Lula is leading polls by a long stretch ahead of the Oct. 7 vote despite not being able to campaign or take part in presidential debates. 
Even if Lula is freed while awaiting appeals of his conviction, Brazilian electoral law bans candidates whose guilty verdicts have been upheld on a first appeal, as is Lula's case. 
His Workers Party registered his candidacy even though Brazil's electoral court is expected to bar him from running before the Sept. 17 deadline for altering tickets.
Lula has denied receiving bribes from government contractors during his two terms in office and says the corruption case against him is a pretext to keep him from returning to power.

A Datafolha poll last week gave him 39 percent of voter support, almost twice that of his nearest rival, far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro.

""Both leaders called for international action to prevent a humanitarian crisis in Idlib Province,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement. 
""Russia is called upon to act in a moderating manner on the Syrian government and prevent a further escalation,"" Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said in a statement.
Seibert said the two leaders also spoke about Ukraine, the Western Balkans and trade, he said, without elaborating. Sanders said they sought ""renewed efforts to solve the conflict in eastern Ukraine.""
The government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Moscow, says it aims to recapture the rebel-held enclave of Idlib in northern Syria, a refuge for civilians and rebels displaced from other areas of Syria, as well as jihadist forces.
The region has been hit by a wave of air strikes and shelling this month in a possible prelude to a full-scale government offensive.
Merkel also raised concerns about the situation in Idlib during a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin just over a week ago.

Turkey's foreign minister said on Friday it would be disastrous to seek a military solution in the region. Turkey, which has backed some rebel groups there, is trying to avert an attack by forces loyal to Assad.

Right-wing Duque said the bloc has acted as an accomplice to the ""Venezuelan dictatorship."" His announcement follows a decision in April by Colombia, along with Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru and Paraguay, to temporarily suspend membership. 
""Today with precise instructions, the foreign minister sent Unasur the letter where we denounce the constituent treaty of that entity and in six months our withdrawal will be effective,"" Duque said in a brief statement broadcast on the presidential website.
Unasur was created in 2008 when leftist populism advocated by the late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez was at its strongest in South America.
""Unasur is an institution that has lent itself, with its silence and often with its complacency ... We cannot continue being part of an institution that has been the greatest accomplice of the Venezuelan dictatorship,"" Duque said.
Venezuela's Information Ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Chavez and other leaders at the time opposed the U.S.-backed proposal for a Free Trade Area of the Americas and instead set up Unasur to join South American nations in an economic and political union.
The initiative was also an attempt to bypass the Washington-based Organization of American States, which leftists considered a tool for promoting U.S. policy in Latin America.

The remaining Unasur members are Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador, Uruguay, Guyana and Suriname.

(Reuters) - Elijah Clayton, one of two men killed on Sunday at a video gaming competition in Jacksonville, Florida, was a peaceful young man who had ""never even had a fist fight,"" his cousin said.
Brandi Pettijohn said her family was ""devastated"" by the fatal shooting of the 22-year-old Clayton, from Woodland Hills, California, who went by the name ""True.""
Taylor Robertson, 27, of Giles, West Virginia, was the second player killed on Sunday. He went by the name ""SpotmePlzzz.""
""Elijah's family wants you to know he was a good man. He did not believe in violence. He never even had a fist fight,"" Pettijohn said to reporters on Monday. She and others in Clayton's family flew to Jacksonville from California on Sunday night.
Both of the men killed were elite players, also called gamers, of the Madden football video game made by EA Sports, a division of  Electronic Arts Inc . (NASDAQ:EA)
Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said the suspect in the shootings had walked past people at a pizza restaurant, which housed the room where the tournament was held, and targeted competitors.
Social media and local media reports in West Virginia showed Robertson was the father of a young son and that he and his wife were married in 2013.
A GoFundMe page raising donations for Robertson's family had raised about $10,000 of a $100,000 goal by Monday afternoon. 
Another GoFundMe page for the families of both men called the ""Madden Community Fallen Angels"" by Monday afternoon had raised about $13,000 of its $100,000 goal. 
Robertson was a football player while he was in high school in Monroe County, West Virginia, and he grew up helping his father do chores on a farm, a local media report showed.
Pettijohn said Clayton had six brothers and three sisters. Clayton's parents stood behind Pettijohn as she addressed reporters on Monday.
""As you all can imagine, we are devastated by yet another senseless act of gun violence. Every person who has stood in this position has said that they never thought this would happen to their family, and we are no different,"" Pettijohn said.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras saw his interior minister take up a key post in his leftist Syriza party on Monday, heralding a cabinet reshuffle to shore up waning support after painful bailouts.
In a rousing speech, Tsipras ruled out early elections, telling his party faithful that polls would be held as scheduled in the autumn of 2019, but that his government and the Syriza movement needed 'new blood'.
The country emerged from the biggest bailout in economic history last week but jaded Greeks found little reason to celebrate after nine years of cuts and job losses. 
""It will be the mother of all battles,"" Tsipras declared, referring to the election next year, effectively firing the opening salvo to what appears to be a long-drawn out election campaign. 
""To give all these battles victoriously we need to rally together, unity and renewal. Our country, the government and the party, need new blood and more appetite to get to work,"" he said.
Greece holds parliamentary elections every four years, with the next expected by October 2019 at the latest. 
Based on the latest three opinion polls conducted by Greek media, Syriza is trailing the main opposition New Democracy conservatives by between 5.3 and 11.6 percentage points.
Panos Skourletis, the interior minister nominated by Tsipras to become new Secretary of Syriza's Central Committee, is a party stalwart with widespread support at a grassroots level. He was backed by a wide majority of central committee members and was elected for the post late on Monday.
Tsipras was elected in 2015 promising to end years of austerity for Greece, imposed by international creditors. But he was forced to reverse course by the prospect of the country being kicked out of the euro zone and pursue deeper reforms under a third international bailout program.
""From now on... we no longer have the alibi of implementing a program which is not ours,"" Skourletis told the central committee, adding that he saw potential for reform but also challenges for the party in the post-bailout period. 
Austerity and political turmoil followed as the economy shrank by a quarter, pushing a third of the population into poverty and forcing the migration of thousands abroad.
The bailout programs concluded last week. Greece has received 288 billion euros in financial aid since 2010.
Tsipras said the government now had the fiscal space to alleviate some tax burden on business and individuals, but was not specific. ""We are ready to proceed with brave interventions,"" he said.
Government officials have previously said the government may scrap plans for further pension cuts next year.
Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos, who steered the country's exit from the third bailout, was likely to remain in his post, sources said. 

Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias, instrumental in brokering an accord ending years of dispute with Macedonia over its name, was also expected to stay on board.

Police said they brought in water cannons after fireworks were thrown from both sides, causing injuries.
State and local officials appealed for calm as thousands of people took to the streets and Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman said Germany would not tolerate ""vigilante justice"".
The unrest reflected a growing schism in German society after Merkel's government allowed about 1 million asylum seekers to enter the country in 2015, triggering a shift to the right in German politics.
Over a thousand leftist protesters massed near a giant statue of Karl Marx in Chemnitz on Monday evening to protest attacks on foreigners that occurred during an impromptu demonstration on Sunday after reports spread on social media about the stabbing of a 35-year-old German man.
""The scenes of people going after those who look like foreigners scare us. We want to show that Chemnitz has another side that is cosmopolitan and opposes xenophobia,"" Tim Detzner, the head of the radical Left party in Chemnitz, told the rally.
Nearly the same number of demonstrators waving German and Bavarian flags gathered nearby, some breaking through police barriers aimed at keeping the two sides apart. Many chanted ""We are the people,"" a slogan used by far-right supporters.
The police in Saxony, the eastern state where Chemnitz lies, said on Twitter at around 1930 GMT that the demonstration had ended and they were accompanying participants to the train station.
Tensions were running high after some 800 demonstrators - including about 50 that police described as ready to commit violence - had taken to the streets on Sunday after the stabbing, which police said occurred after a row.
Local prosecutors said they had arrested two suspects, a 22-year-old Syrian man and a 21-year-old Iraqi man. 
FAR RIGHT
Television news channels broadcast amateur footage of skinheads chasing a man through the streets at Sunday's protest. Police said they were still investigating reports of injury filed by Syrian, Afghan and Bulgarian people, and at least four demonstrators had been charged.
""We don't tolerate such unlawful assemblies and the hounding of people who look different or have different origins, and attempts to spread hatred on the streets,"" Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert told a regular news briefing.
""That has no place in our cities and we, as the German government, condemn it in the strongest terms,"" he said. ""Our basic message for Chemnitz and beyond is that there is no place in Germany for vigilante justice, for groups that want to spread hatred on the streets, for intolerance and for extremism.""
Roland Woeller, interior minister of the state of Saxony, which includes Chemnitz, said authorities would not allow ""anarchists"" to run rampant. He warned against ""misinformation and lies"" circulating in social media.
The arrival of huge numbers of migrants from the Middle East three years ago has fueled support for far-right groups such as PEGIDA and the Alternative for Germany (AfD), now the main opposition party in parliament.
Tweeting about Sunday's incident, AfD politician Markus Frohnmaier said: ""If the state is no longer to protect citizens then people take to the streets and protect themselves. It's as simple as that!""
Martina Renner, a Left party lawmaker, accused the far-right of trying to exploit a murder for its own political ends.
""A terrible murder, the background to which is still unclear, is being instrumentalized in the most repugnant way for racist riots in Chemnitz,"" she tweeted.

The violence in Chemnitz is likely to put further pressure on Merkel's conservatives, who last week faced accusations of ignoring the rise of far-right groups in Saxony.

610,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2018 04:36PM ET</span>","Exclusive: U.S. Army forms plan to test 40,000 homes for lead following Reuters report","By Joshua Schneyer and Andrea Januta
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Army has drafted a plan to test for toxic lead hazards in 40,000 homes on its bases, military documents show, in a sweeping response to a Reuters report that found children at risk of lead poisoning in military housing.
The inspection program, if implemented, would begin quickly and prioritize thousands of Army post homes occupied by small children, who are most vulnerable to lead exposure. Ingesting the heavy metal can stunt brain development and cause lifelong health impacts.
The lead inspections would cost up to $386 million and target pre-1978 homes to identify deteriorating lead-based paint and leaded dust, water or soil, according to the military documents.
A draft Army Execution Order says the program's mission is to mitigate all identified lead hazards in Army post homes in the United States. In homes where dangers are detected, the Army would offer soldiers' families ""temporary or permanent relocation"" to housing safe from lead hazards, it says.
The Army's mobilization comes after Reuters published an investigation https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-military-housing on August 16 describing lead paint poisoning hazards in privatized military base homes. It documented at least 1,050 small children who tested high for lead at base clinics in recent years. Their results often weren't being reported to state health authorities as required, Reuters found.
Behind the numbers were injured families, including that of a decorated Army colonel, J. Cale Brown, whose son JC was poisoned by lead while living at Fort Benning, in Georgia.
The article drew a quick response from lawmakers, with eight U.S. senators demanding action to protect military families living in base housing.
The Army's planned response is laid out in military documents, including the draft Execution Order, minutes from a private meeting attended by top Army brass, and other materials.
One priority, detailed by Under Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy in an August 22 meeting, is for the military's response to counter any sense ""that we … are not taking care of children of Soldiers and are not taking appropriate action quickly enough,"" meeting minutes say. ""The Army will remain focused on the actions to assess, inspect, and mitigate risks to Soldiers and Families,"" the minutes say, citing McCarthy and Vice Chief of Staff General James C. McConville.
Army spokeswoman Colonel Kathleen Turner acknowledged plans are being formulated but said no decisions have been made. ""Out of an abundance of caution, we are going above and beyond current requirements to ensure the safety of our soldiers and their families who work and live on all of our installations,"" Turner said in a statement. ""We are currently evaluating all options to address these concerns.”
Old lead-based paint becomes a poisoning hazard when it deteriorates, and poor maintenance of military base homes can leave legions at risk. About 30 percent of service families – including some 100,000 small children – live in U.S. military housing owned and operated by private companies in business with the military.
There are nearly 100,000 homes on U.S. Army bases, and the lead inspections are expected to focus on the approximately 40,000 built before a 1978 U.S. ban on the sale of lead paint.
The plans depart from guidance that appeared on the Army Public Health Center's website https://phc.amedd.army.mil/topics/workplacehealth/ih/Pages/Lead.aspx as recently as last week, which ""discouraged"" lead-based paint inspections in Army homes. The website has since been updated and omits that language.
Under the plans, the documents show, the Army would:
- Inspect all pre-1978 Army family housing units nationwide, including visual lead-based paint assessments by certified personnel, swipe-testing for toxic lead paint dust, and testing of tap water. Some homes will also receive soil testing. This phase alone, described as ""near term actions,"" will cost between $328 million to $386 million, the Army's Installation Services director estimated.
- Temporarily or permanently relocate families when hazards are found. ""If a Family or Soldier are concerned with potential negative impacts from lead; the U.S. Army will offer them a chance to relocate to a new residence,"" the documents say. ""We must do everything we can to maintain that trust.""
- Conduct town hall meetings on Army posts to address residents' lead concerns. The Army intends to do so with ""empathy,"" the meeting minutes say. ""Tone is key and can be just as important as the actions we take.""
The documents leave some questions unanswered. They don't say how long it would take to inspect all 40,000 homes. Also unclear is whether the Army has funds immediately available for the program, or would need Congressional authorization to set them aside.
The Army would ensure that the private contractors who operate base housing ""are meeting their obligations"" to maintain base homes, the documents say, and would require them to show compliance with lead safety standards through independent audits.
The documents do not discuss whether private housing contractors would bear any of the costs of the lead inspections, or how any repairs would be funded.
In most cases, Army post homes are now majority-owned by private real estate companies. Under their 50-year agreements with the Army, corporate landlords operating military housing agreed to control lead, asbestos, mold, and other toxic risks present in some homes, particularly historic ones.
FAMILIES, SENATORS PRESS FOR ANSWERS
The Army plans come as base commanders and housing contractors face a wave of complaints about potential home lead hazards, and a rush of military families seeking lead tests for their children.
Last week, the hospital at Fort Benning, where Reuters reported that at least 31 small children had tested high for lead exposure in recent years, began offering ""walk-in"" lead testing. Some concerned families are already being relocated; in other homes, maintenance workers are using painter's tape to mark peeling paint spots that residents found contained lead by using store-bought testing kits.
Lead poisoning is preventable, and its prevalence in the United States has declined sharply in recent decades. Still, a 2016 Reuters investigation documented thousands of remaining exposure hotspots, mostly in civilian neighborhoods.
Last week, eight senators, including Republican Johnny Isakson of Georgia and Democrat Claire McCaskill of Missouri, pushed amendments to legislation to examine and address https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-lead-gao/u-s-senators-seek-review-of-lead-in-military-housing-citing-reuters-idUSKCN1L82DV the military's handling of lead exposure risks.

In coming weeks, Army officials plan to meet with lawmakers to address their concerns, the military documents show.

Seehofer told German news agency dpa that he expected an agreement to be reached with Italy, following similar deals with Greece and Spain earlier this month.
""We are far along. There will be an agreement,"" Seehofer told dpa when asked about negotiations with Italy on the sidelines of an event in Freilassing, a town on the border between his own state of Bavaria and Austria.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - The scandal that started with a former Argentine official stashing cash in a convent and deepened when records of alleged bribe payments were published took new turn on Monday with accusations by a lawyer for former President Cristina Fernandez that a dressing room in her apartment might have been contaminated by a toxic substance.
More than a dozen construction company executives and officials from Fernandez's administration have been arrested as result of a graft probe. The scandal threatens to damage Argentina's already ailing economy and upset next year's presidential election.
Investigators searched Fernandez's Buenos Aires apartment last week, looking for evidence. On Monday she posted on her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page a statement from her lawyer saying domestic employees cleaning her dressing room after the search became mysteriously ill.
""An extraordinarily grave situation arose in the residence,"" the statement by lawyer Carlos Alberto Beraldi said.
He described cleaning personnel suddenly beset by ""dizziness, strong itching in the throat and eyes and breathing difficulties."" It said the cleaners were treated at a hospital.
""It was found that the ailments were caused by contact with a toxic substance, and it was recommended to avoid re-exposure to the same environment,"" the statement said.
""For this reason, my client decided not to return to the apartment until there is an examination of the place and the items that were subject to manipulation during the raid.""
A government spokeswoman declined to comment. Fernandez denies wrongdoing and says she is being persecuted by President Mauricio Macri. The two may face off in next year's presidential election. 
Fernandez has been indicted on charges she ran a corruption scheme with her public works secretary, Jose Lopez, who was caught stashing millions of dollars in a convent near capital city Buenos Aires. Lopez has struck a deal giving him lenient treatment in exchange for his cooperation in the investigation, according to court documents.
He has been moved from jail to an unknown location.
A local newspaper this month published contents of notebooks kept by a chauffer employed by the Fernandez administration who said he transported bribe money from construction companies to public works officials from 2005 to 2015.
The scandal has further shaken confidence in an economy beset by high inflation and a tumbling peso currency. 
The government on Monday unveiled a new system for increasing transparency in the way public works contracts are awarded.

""We know that the so-called 'notebooks case' has generated uncertainty,"" Transportation Minister Guillermo Dietrich told reporters.

Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, general secretary of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), told the mass-circulation Bild newspaper Germany should accelerate moves to phase out the ""solidarity tax"" introduced after reunification to support poorer states in eastern Germany, a move now planned for 2021.

CAIRO (Reuters) - A coalition of secular and leftist Egyptian groups on Monday slammed the arrests of opposition figures and called for the release of all such prisoners not convicted of violent offences.
Masoum Marzouk, a former ambassador, and six other activists were arrested on Thursday and detained for 15 days pending investigation on charges of joining a terrorist group and receiving funds for terrorism. He had recently called for a referendum on President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s rule, in rare public criticism of the former general.
The Civil Democratic Movement (CDM) said in a statement read out by its spokesman, Yehia Hussain, at a news conference that the group ""rejects such police tactics in dealing with political opponents"". 
""The recent campaign of arrests ... is part of a systematic policy followed by the regime to silence any voice that opposes its oppressive policies that are hostile to freedoms,"" the statement said.
The statement said such policies were a ""cover-up for its economic and social failures by constantly claiming that there are conspiracies that are being woven in the dark against the country"".
Egyptian authorities have jailed thousands of opponents in recent years, most of them suspected Islamists, but some secular activists and journalists. The government has said its actions are directed at terrorists and saboteurs trying to undermine the state.
Sisi was elected president in 2014, a year after the military ousted Islamist president Mohamed Mursi following mass protests against his rule.
The CDM, founded in December, includes eight secular and left-leaning parties and 150 prominent activists and political figures. It called for a boycott of the presidential election in March after all major opposition campaigns withdrew on the grounds of intimidation.
Former presidential candidate Hamdeen Sabahi, a member of the movement who ran in the 2012 and 2014 elections, called the government a ""failed regime"".
""This regime must be changed,"" he said. ""This authority is a failure. This authority is repressive ... an authority of corruption, tyranny and repression is an oppressive regime,"" he told the news conference. 
Fareed Zahran, head of the Egyptian Democratic Social Party, said the target of the call for regime change was not Sisi, but rules and regulations that shackle freedoms.

U.S. District Judge Robert Lasnik in Seattle issued the extension of a nationwide injunction, blocking a Texas-based group from disseminating files for printing plastic weapons on the internet.
Lasnik's prior order, issued on July 31, blocked the release of the blueprints hours before they were set to hit the internet. That ban was due to expire on Tuesday and the new one will remain in place until the case is resolved.
Monday's decision blocks a settlement between the Trump administration and Defense Distributed, a group that argues access to the online blueprints is guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution's First and Second Amendments, which protect free speech and the right to bear arms, respectively.
A group of 19 U.S. states and the District of Columbia sued the U.S. government in July, arguing that publishing the blueprints would allow criminals easy access to weapons. They also said the Trump administration had failed to explain why it settled the case.
Lasnik said the states have submitted sufficient evidence that they are likely to suffer ""irreparable harm"" if the blueprints are published. The judge also said Defense Distributed's First Amendment concerns were ""dwarfed"" by the states' safety considerations.
Gun control proponents are concerned the weapons made from 3-D printers will be untraceable, undetectable ""ghost"" firearms that pose a threat to global security. Some gun rights groups say the technology is expensive, the guns are unreliable and the threat is overblown. They also say undetectable guns wholly made of plastic are illegal in the United States.
'INTENTIONAL INSULT'
Although Defense Distributed originally had said it would put the files on the internet on Aug. 1, it did so a few days before Lasnik issued the initial temporary ban. The blueprints continue to be available on several other websites.
The files include 3-D printable blueprints for components that would go into the making of a version of the AR-15 semi-automatic assault rifle, a weapon that has been used in U.S. mass shootings.
Defense Distributed founder Cody Wilson called Lasnik's decision an ""intentional insult."" ""The order is a manifest injustice and literally admits to being an abridgment of the freedom of speech,"" Wilson said in a statement.
A lawyer for the group said it is currently reviewing the judge's decision and considering all options.
Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who led the states' lawsuit, said in a statement that he was glad about the decision, but criticized the federal government.
""Why is the Trump Administration working so hard to allow these untraceable, undetectable 3D-printed guns to be available to domestic abusers, felons and terrorists?"" Ferguson said.
The U.S. State Department, which had previously banned the blueprints as a national security risk and a violation of arms trafficking regulations, also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
As recently as April, the government in court filings argued downloadable guns would allow extremist groups and criminals abroad unfettered access to arms.
But a lawyer for the State Department said in a court hearing last month that the government had determined in May that the types of guns featured in Defense Distributed's blueprints did not pose a national security risk as they can be bought ""in any store."" 
Lasnik on Monday said the government had failed to comply with procedural rules that mandate a 30-day notice period to the U.S. Congress before allowing the files' dissemination. 

""Forcing the federal defendants to evaluate the effect of the proposed delisting on world peace, national security, and the foreign policy of the United States ... may also prompt a reconsideration of the decision,"" Lasnik said.

The photographs show the 65-year-old Putin in a khaki outfit and hat, carrying binoculars and trekking poles, hiking in forested mountains and enjoying a boat ride on the Yenisei river in the Tuva region of southern Siberia.
Previous outdoor snapshots of Putin on holiday, including images of him fishing and sunbathing shirtless, appear intended to demonstrate his robust physical health and vigor as he wrestles with the affairs of state.
In one image shown of his Siberian trip, Putin and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu are studying a coniferous sapling, ready for planting. In another, Putin and FSB chief Alexander Bortnikov stand in a forest clearing against a backdrop of forested mountains. 
Other pictures show Putin at the summit of a mountain, taking a boat ride, and talking to the head of the Sayano-Shushenski Nature Reserve. 
Putin took the break on his way to the Siberian city of Kemerovo, a coal mining hub, where he attended a meeting with government officials and top managers of energy companies on Monday.
""The president, on his way to Kemerovo, decided to fly out earlier and spend Saturday and Sunday in Tuva, on the Yenisei River. He walked in the mountains, admired the beautiful views,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.

The measures would require employers to take reasonable measures to prevent, stop, and deal with complaints about sexual harassment, the report added.
The draft, which is part of a wider civil code, was presented to the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, which is expected to run until Friday, according to the report. 
On Monday, the second phase of the civil code formulation started and is expected to run till 2020, the report said, citing Shen Chunyao, who heads the Legislative Affairs Commission under the NPC Standing Committee. 
In recent weeks, the #MeToo movement has escalated in China with accusations of sexual assault spreading across the social media in a country where issues like sexual assault have traditionally been brushed under the carpet.

The development will help accommodate new aircrafts and systems introduced to the air force service including French Rafale fighter jets, American F-15 fighter jets and Eurofighter Typhoon jets, Deputy Commander of the Amiri Air Force Major-General (Pilot) Ahmed Ibrahim Al Malki said in comments published by the official state news agency QNA.
The other development will take place at Doha Air Base. Malki did not provide details about the projects' expected cost or timeframe.
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic, trade and transport ties with Qatar in June 2017, accusing it of supporting terrorism. Doha denies that charge and says the boycott is an attempt to impinge on its sovereignty.
Doha has used the wealth it has accumulated as the world's biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas to defy some of the largest and wealthiest Arab countries. It has repeatedly called for dialogue with its neighbors, although it has strengthened its military as relations with them have deteriorated. 
Last December, Qatar entered into a 5 billion pound ($6.38 billion) contract with British defense group BAE Systems (LON:BAES) for the purchase of 24 Typhoon combat aircraft and a $6.2 billion deal with Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co for 36 F-15 aircraft. It also agreed to buy 12 additional Dassault Aviation-made Rafale fighters with an option for 36 more.
The Gulf dispute has eluded mediation efforts by the United States, which has military bases in both Qatar and some of the countries lined up against it - including Udeid, from which U.S.-led coalition aircraft stage sorties against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.
Nonetheless, Qatari forces participated in joint military exercises in Saudi Arabia in April in an apparent sign of some compromise between the adversaries.
U.S. President Donald Trump publicly sided with the Saudis and Emiratis early in the crisis but then began pushing for a resolution to restore Gulf unity and maintain a united front against Iran.

After the attack, Vladimir Kovacevic was admitted to a local hospital where he was treated for injuries to his head and body.
On his Twitter account Kovacevic posted a photo which showed his head bandaged and face covered in cuts and bruises. https://twitter.com/corbapas
He also said the masked men who ambushed him near his apartment escaped in a car. 
The attack prompted a peaceful protest of reporters and activists in Banja Luka on Monday.
In a statement, the private BN TV, demanded that the interior ministry of the Republika Srpska, the Serb entity in Bosnia, find the perpetrators and warned of ""constant (verbal) attacks from certain political circles."" 
BN TV also demanded police ensure the safety and freedom of movement for its employees. 
""Otherwise we will be forced to take steps to protect ourselves,"" it said.
Kovacevic was working on a story about the controversial death of a young man from Banja Luka this year which triggered ongoing mass protests. 
On 18 March 2018, 21-year-old David Dragicevic went out with friends but was declared missing after failing to return home. His body was later found in a creek in downtown Banja Luka. 
Police said he drowned and had alcohol and drugs in his body. His father said he was captured, tortured and killed.
In June, an inquiry board formed by the Bosnian Serb parliament adopted a 320-page long report concluding that there was ample evidence that Dragicevic was murdered and that the public prosecutor should immediately respond to those findings.
In July, parliament, which is dominated by loyalists of Milorad Dodik, the President of the Republika Srpska, rejected the report but said that prosecutors in the case had made numerous errors.
Dodik on Monday condemned the attack on Kovacevic, visiting him in hospital and demanding police solve the case.
""Attacks against the press are attacks against the freedom of speech,"" said Dodik who frequently lashes out at reporters who criticize his policies.
The European Union which Bosnia ultimately wants to join, as well as the Organisation for the Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) also strongly condemned attacks and threats against journalists.
The association of Bosnian journalists said the attack was aimed at pressuring independent media and blamed Dodik for labeling independent media and reporters as enemies and spies.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Police in Ethiopia arrested the disgraced former head of the eastern Somali region on Monday on charges of human rights abuses and stoking deadly ethnic clashes, the attorney general's office said.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, presiding over democratic reforms in the African nation of 100 million, said on Saturday rights abuses committed in the region ""defied belief"" and included torture, rapes and killings. 
The region's administrator, Abdi Mohammed Omer, was forced to resign on Aug. 6 after violence broke out in the provincial capital Jijiga.
At least 20 people died and thousands fled Jijiga as mobs looted properties owned by ethnic minorities and burned down several Ethiopian Orthodox churches.
The central authorities said the unrest in the region had been triggered by local officials fearing arrest on human rights abuse charges. [L5N1UV0ES]
On Monday, Federal Police ""apprehended Abdi Mohammed Omer at his home in Addis Ababa,"" state-run Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation said, citing the Federal Attorney General's Office. 
""Crimes he committed include, among others, human rights abuses and stoking disputes along ethnic and religious lines,"" it said, adding that other officials were also sought by police. 
Rights groups have routinely accused Abdi's administration of abuses such as torture, while some witnesses claimed he had ordered paramilitary raids on civilians in neighboring Oromiya province after ethnic clashes there last September.
The government fired senior regional prison officials last month over accusations of torture. Abiy on Saturday described cases in which prisoners had been put into cells with lions, hyenas and leopards to force them into confessing.
The region has been plagued by violence for the last three decades, in which the government fought the secessionist Ogaden National Liberation Front before the group declared a unilateral ceasefire this month in the wake of reforms.[L5N1V30CE]
The region holds four trillion cubic feet of oil and gas reserves, government estimates show. China's GCL-Poly Petroleum Investments has been developing two gas fields there since 2013.

625,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2018 11:59AM ET</span>",Russian court jails Kremlin critic Navalny over protest,"By Denis Pinchuk and Andrew Osborn
MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian court sentenced opposition leader Alexei Navalny to 30 days in jail on Monday after convicting him of breaking public protest laws, a move he said was illegal and aimed at stopping him leading a rally against pension reform next month.
Navalny, who was detained by police outside his home on Saturday, was found guilty of breaking the law by organizing an unauthorized Moscow rally on Jan. 28 which called for a boycott of what he predicted would be a rigged presidential election. 
Under Russian law, the time, place and size of such protests must be agreed in advance with the authorities who have a track record of rejecting applications to rally in central Moscow and of suggesting less prominent locations instead. 
Navalny, who was barred from taking part in the March presidential election over what he said was a trumped-up suspended prison sentence, has been repeatedly jailed for going ahead with such protests anyway despite official rejections. 
The 42-year-old politician, who told the court he would never give up trying to organize street protests, said on Monday he believed the authorities were jailing him now, more than six months after his alleged offence, to stop him taking part in a protest planned for Sept. 9 against plans to raise the retirement age in Russia.
That is the same day as Moscow elects a new mayor, a contest expected to be easily won by incumbent Sergei Sobyanin, an ally of President Vladimir Putin, and authorities have rejected an application by Navalny's supporters to rally in central Moscow. 
'STRANGE TRIAL' 
""This strange trial is happening with the single aim of not allowing me to take part in the protest,"" Navalny told the presiding judge. ""You and I both know it.""
As he was led out of the courtroom, he shouted out the date and time of the planned rally.
""Everyone come to the meeting,"" he said. 
Navalny is hoping to tap into public anger over government plans to raise the retirement age to 65 from 60 for men and to 63 from 55 for women.
Opinion polls show most Russians strongly oppose the plan, which has been seen as responsible for a drop in Putin's approval rating in recent months, prompting speculation that the Russian leader, whom Navalny has likened to an autocratic tsar, may decide to dilute the reform.
Putin, who makes a point of never saying Navalny's name aloud when asked about him, has dismissed him as a troublemaker bent on sowing chaos on behalf of the United States.

Navalny has used protests and corruption exposes of the sometimes gilded lives of government officials to mobilize support. But many Russians, who still get much of their news from state TV which either ignores or derides him, say they do not know who he is.

The bloc's foreign ministers will discuss the matter in Austria later this week. 
EU officials expect the bloc to stick to its line that it would not offer reconstruction money for as long as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad - propped back to power by Russian and Iranian militaries - does not let the opposition share power.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said before talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel earlier this month that everything needed to be done for Syria refugees to return.
""But the conditions are just not there. Russia would want us to pay for it but Syria under Assad is not safe,"" said one EU official. 
The EU has backed Syrian opposition groups in the multi-faceted war that has raged for more than seven years, largely because global and regional powers disagree on how to end it.

PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron on Monday said preserving European Union unity was more important than forging a close relationship with post-Brexit Britain, and hit out at what he called U.S. President Donald Trump's ""aggressive"" isolationism. 
As pressure mounts on Prime Minister Theresa May to agree terms for Britain's divorce from the EU and the shape of their future trade relationship, Macron showed no sign of breaking ranks with other EU capitals. 
""France wants to maintain a strong, special relationship with London but not if the cost is the European Union's unraveling,"" he told a gathering of French ambassadors.
Brexit, Macron said, ""is a sovereign choice, which we must respect, but it can't come at the expense of the European Union's integrity"".
Macron did not announce any major shifts in foreign policy in the annual address to his ambassadors, but spoke forcefully about what he labeled the ""crisis of multilateralism"" and the need to make Europe more ""sovereign"".
He urged Europe to exert itself as ""a trade and economic power"", which defends its strategic interests and financial independence and is able to fend off the extraterritorial reach of U.S. sanctions.
Macron also pressed the need for EU member states to show more solidarity. 
""Italy is against the Europe which shows no solidarity on migration, but it is for the Europe of structural funds, or so it seems when I hear some ministers speak,"" Macron said.
""What is happening in Italy is our political doing, an absence of solidarity. Does that excuse xenophobic rhetoric? I don't think so,"" he added. 
TESTS 
In his first year, Macron banked on nurturing relationships with leaders such as Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, appearing engaged on the world stage but often remaining non-committal and trying to mediate without unsettling anyone.
That approach has been tested after Trump shunned Macron and other allies, pulling out of a global climate pact, imposing extraterritorial sanctions on Iran, and imposing tariffs on EU steel and aluminum. 
""Multilateralism is going through a major crisis which collides with all our diplomatic activity, above all because of U.S. policy,"" he said.
""The partner with whom Europe built the new post-World War order appears to be turning its back on this shared history,"" he said. ""Europe can no longer rely entirely on the United States for its security.""
Macron also touched on conflicts in the Middle East. He described the situation in Syria as ""alarming"" and reaching a ""moment of truth"", and reiterated his call for broadened talks on Iran's nuclear activity. [L8N1VI18F]

On Libya, Macron expressed determination to see through a plan for elections to be held in December.

630,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2018 10:31AM ET</span>",Tony award-winning U.S. playwright Neil Simon dies at 91,"(This August 26 story corrects in 25th paragraph to say Marsha Mason was nominated for ""Goodbye Girl"" Oscar but did not win.)
By Bill Trott
(Reuters) - U.S. playwright Neil Simon, who became one of Broadway's most prolific and popular playwrights as he combined humor, drama and introspection in works such as ""The Odd Couple,"" ""The Goodbye Girl"" and ""Lost in Yonkers,"" died on Sunday at the age of 91, his representatives said.
Simon died at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in New York City of complications from pneumonia, Broadway theater representatives DKC/O&M said in a statement on Sunday. Simon was admitted to the hospital a few days ago and the pneumonia was in his lungs, Simon's longtime publicist Bill Evans said in a Sunday phone interview. Evans said he gave Simon a kidney in 2004. 
""It was wonderful to be in his life and for him to be in my life,"" Evans said, calling Simon a major figure in American culture. ""It has been so great to be part of all of it."" 
Simon drew on his tumultuous New York Jewish upbringing in many of his works. 
A new Simon play almost every theatrical season was a Broadway staple from 1960 through the mid-1990s, placing him in the ranks of America's top playwrights. He wrote more than 40 plays that were funny, moving and immensely popular - sometimes shifting from slapstick to melodrama with the turn of a phrase.
At one point he had a record four plays running simultaneously on Broadway.
Simon was called ""not just a show business success but an institution"" by one New York critic. While his voice and comedy were decidedly East Coast and often reflected an ethnic Jewish experience, Simon's works played to packed houses around the world.
He won Tony Awards for ""The Odd Couple,"" ""Biloxi Blues"" and ""Lost in Yonkers"" and a fourth for his overall contribution to American theater. He was nominated for 13 other Tonys.
""Lost in Yonkers"" (1990), a painfully funny story about the relationship between an abusive mother and her grown children, also won the Pulitzer Prize for drama in 1991.
Simon's childhood was marred by the breakup of his parents. At first he was reluctant to draw on that pain, fearing it would make his plays too dark.
Later in his career he would use his own painful experiences, such as in the semi-biographical ""Brighton Beach Memoirs,"" to give his work more depth.
But being entertaining was his primary goal.
""When I was a kid, I climbed up on a stone ledge to watch an outdoor movie of Charlie Chaplin,"" Simon once told Life magazine. ""I laughed so hard I fell off, cut my head open and was taken to the doctor, bleeding and laughing.
""... My idea of the ultimate achievement in a comedy is to make a whole audience fall onto the floor, writhing and laughing so hard that some of them pass out.""
Simon's plays made him a wealthy man and many were turned into films, which made him even wealthier and earned him four Academy Award nominations. Among his works appearing on movie screens were ""Barefoot in the Park,"" ""Plaza Suite,"" ""Brighton Beach Memoirs,"" ""Biloxi Blues"" and ""Broadway Bound."" ""The Odd Couple"" was even made into a successful television sitcom.
Early Simon works were sometimes deemed too sentimental or commercial by critics but as his career entered its third decade, the plays grew more serious, more mature. Frank Rich of the New York Times wrote of ""Biloxi Blues"" (1985) that Simon ""at last begins to examine himself honestly, without compromises, and as a result is his most persuasively serious effort.""
Marvin Neil Simon was born on July 4, 1927, in the New York City borough of the Bronx, son of Irving, a garment salesman, and Mamie Simon.
After attending New York University and the University of Denver and serving in the U.S. Air Force Reserve, Simon and his mentor, older brother Danny Simon, worked together in the 1940s writing comedy sketches for radio performer Goodman Ace.
Simon and Danny, whose living arrangements once inspired Neil's ""The Odd Couple,"" then moved to television, working with such popular entertainers as Sid Caesar, Phil Silver and Jackie Gleason, and with other writers including Mel Brooks and Woody Allen.
But Simon did not like television work and in 1960 came up with ""Come Blow Your Horn,"" which became a modest Broadway hit. It was followed by ""Barefoot in the Park"" in 1963, which ran for more than 1,500 performances. Simon would go on to dominate the 1960s with ""The Odd Couple,"" ""Sweet Charity,"" ""Plaza Suite"" and ""The Last of the Red Hot Lovers.""
In the '70s he turned out ""The Prisoner of Second Avenue,"" ""The Sunshine Boys"" and ""California Suite"" while his '80s works included ""Brighton Beach Memoirs,"" Biloxi Blues,"" ""Broadway Bound"" and ""Rumors."" Simon continued into the next decade with ""Lost in Yonkers,"" ""Jake's Women,"" ""The Goodbye Girl"" and ""Laughter on the 23rd Floor.""
His semi-autobiographical trilogy - ""Brighton Beach Memoirs,"" ""Biloxi Blues"" and ""Broadway Bound - was a fixture on Broadway in the 1980s.
CREATIVE 'PINBALL MACHINE'
Simon once compared his own creative process to a pinball machine, such as when he was writing ""Lost in Yonkers."" The creative concept, he said, began ""to move circuitously around in my brain, bouncing off one neuron to another, like a pinball that hits every number of the board repeatedly, rolls down, hits the flippers and goes bouncing back up for another go at every bell-ringing number again.""
Simon's plays were usually set in New York with characters whose problems were similar to those experienced by Simon.
""Chapter Two,"" for example, dealt with a writer whose first wife had died, trying to open himself to love a new woman. Simon's wife of 20 years, Joan Baim, died of cancer in 1973, after which he married actress Marsha Mason, who starred in the 1979 film version of ""Chapter Two."" Mason was nominated for an Oscar for 1977's ""The Goodbye Girl,"" another Simon play he adapted for the screen.
Simon received Kennedy Center honors in 1995 from President Bill Clinton for his contribution to the arts and to popular culture in the 20th century.
""He challenges us and himself never to take ourselves too seriously,"" Clinton said in presenting the award. ""Thank you for the wit and the wisdom.""

Simon was married five times, twice to actress Diane Lander. He is survived by wife Elaine Joyce and his three daughters from different marriages, Evans said.

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - A deadly plane crash at Nepal's international airport was the fault of the pilot, who had been “extremely upset” and chain-smoked and wept in the cockpit during the flight, an investigation report said.
The US-Bangla Airlines flight from Dhaka to the Nepali capital in March crashed on landing in Kathmandu and caught fire, killing 51 of the 71 people on board, in the Himalayan nation’s worst aviation disaster for 26 years.
Parts of a draft report by a Nepali government-appointed panel, seen by Reuters on Monday, said the captain, Abid Sultan, had been ""extremely upset and hurt” by a female colleague who raised questions about his reputation as an instructor in the airline. 
“He was very much under stress due to this particular issue,” the report said. 
“This mistrust and stress led him to continuously smoke in the cockpit and also suffer an emotional breakdown several times during the flight,” it said.
""The captain was 'crying and sneezing' on several occasions during the flight,"" the draft said, citing recorded conversation between the cockpit and air traffic controllers.
The first officer was constantly trying to console him, it added.
The captain, a former Bangladesh air force pilot, failed to follow instructions from air traffic controllers to land from a southern approach and took a more difficult northern approach to the single runway. He was unable to align the plane before landing, the report said.
The plane skidded off the runway onto the grass around it. The captain was among those killed.
Reuters was not able to see the complete report. An official of the investigation commission said the draft had been “illegally leaked” and that the final report would take some time to be published.
US-Bangla Airlines CEO Imran Asif said in Dhaka: “The official report has not been published or released. I don't know what evidence they are talking about.” 
Landing at Kathmandu airport, which is surrounded by hills, is considered difficult.
In 1992 all 167 people aboard a Pakistan International Airlines plane were killed when it plowed into a hill as it tried to land.

CATANIA/ROME, Italy (Reuters) - Italy's hardline interior minister, Matteo Salvini, is surfing a wave of public support after his latest showdown over immigration with the European Union, a row that also pitted him against a new foe: his country's own judiciary.
The 10-day-old standoff ended in southern Catania port at the weekend after EU member Ireland and Albania, an EU aspirant, agreed to take some of the 150 migrants who had been rescued at sea and denied permission by Salvini to come ashore.
Salvini, though, remains under investigation from a Sicilian magistrate for alleged abuse of power and holding people against their will, an extraordinary challenge which appears to have only strengthened his public appeal and political hand.
""He had tried to do the right thing by us and now they investigate him,"" 76-year-old pensioner Sebastiano Pittera said outside Catania's main cathedral after the home minister allowed the migrants to disembark from a rescue ship.
""We are not a rubbish bin for Africa."" 
About 650,000 people have reached Italian shores since 2014, mostly from Africa, and the country houses 160,000 asylum seekers.
The pensioner's remarks chime with a straw poll of TV viewers on the same day by broadcaster Sky, which showed 80 percent support for Rome's hard line, and with political experts who say the investigation helps Salvini in his anti-EU campaign.
A survey by pollster SWG, carried out at the end of July, showed 30 percent backing for Salvini's right-wing League party, compared with its 17 percent support at the March general election and outstripping its bigger coalition partner, the 5-Star Movement, which won almost twice as many seats in parliament.
The stronger Salvini becomes at home, the more pressure he can apply on his EU partners, not only on immigration but over EU fiscal rules, the experts say. The coalition is pushing Brussels to approve a big-spending Italian budget for 2019.
""The prosecutor has done Salvini a gigantic favor. It turns him into a martyr,"" said Francesco Galietti, head of political risk consultancy Policy Sonar.
Prosecutor Luigi Patronaggio, who traveled to Rome on Saturday to question interior ministry officials as part of his criminal investigation, declined to be interviewed by Reuters.
He opened his inquiry last week against ""unknown persons"" -- a preliminary step in Italian judicial investigations -- but Salvini later said he was responsible for his ministry's actions, challenging the prosecutor to arrest him.
""I am not afraid of anything: investigate, interrogate me, arrest me. I am PROUD to fight to defend our borders and the security of Italians and protect the future for our children,"" he tweeted at the height of the standoff.
Salvini has effectively closed ports to asylum-seekers rescued at sea, demanding his EU partners accept a proportion of Africans who are intercepted by rescue ships off Italy. 
Though arrival by boat into Italy are down 81 percent so far this year, EU nations have not committed to take those rescued at sea. At a meeting on Friday, EU officials failed again to go beyond the bloc's current reliance on voluntary, ad hoc help.
Lorenzo Pregliasco, head of pollster and political analysis firm YouTrend, said the investigation into Salvini would boost his support, just as former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi used judicial challenges to garner voter sympathy in the 1990s.
""I have no doubt this could be helpful for him in terms of energizing his base,"" Pregliasco said.
Salvini's political appeal has been nationwide despite his League having been born in Italy's wealthy north with an avowed aim of splitting from the poor south, a goal since abandoned.
In Catania, even those who are not fervent Salvini supporters, believe he should not face criminal investigation for his refusal to allow migrants to come ashore.

""He (the prosecutor) has not done well, and nor has Salvini. But if I were to have to choose between the two, I would choose Salvini. It's not right that Italy is the only point of disembarkation,"" said Michela Musumarra, 24, who works in a tourist office in Catania.

Spanish police arrested 55-year-old Dutchman Jos Brech - who was publicly named as the suspected killer by Dutch police last week - about 50 km (30 miles) north of Barcelona on Sunday.
Dutch detectives said the suspect's DNA matched traces on the body and clothing of Nicky Verstappen, who was found dead on Aug. 10, 1998 near a summer camp in the Dutch countryside from which he had gone missing the previous night.
The match was established in June this year, police said, using DNA provided by relatives of the suspect who had reported him missing in April. Police went public with their information last week, publishing the man's picture and full name.
""Spanish police were able to arrest him after someone recognized the man from the picture,"" prosecutor Jan Eland said. Brech will be extradited to the Netherlands, he said, but it is unclear how long that will take. 
Over the years, police have made several wrongful arrests in the case, and even opened up the grave of one of the supervisors of the summer camp. 
Earlier this year, over 15,000 men who lived near the place where the boy was found responded to a request for samples of their DNA, but also without success.
Brech was interviewed by police near the scene of the crime in the days after the killing, but merely as a passer-by. His name didn't turn up again until his relatives handed over some of his items when they reported him missing last April.

Cannabis is hardier, less thirsty and cheaper to grow than the region's other main crops like apples and potatoes, but it is also illegal - for now. 
Parliament will consider legalizing its growth for medicinal use, the speaker said last month, but in the Bekaa, some people are unconvinced there will be a meaningful change. 
""It is like giving a dog a bone because people are hungry and can't bear it any more,"" said cannabis farmer Abu Mohammad, 52. 
""But whether they legalize it or not, the most important thing is to give an amnesty,"" he said, echoing a common complaint in the region. Farmers faced prison terms of five years, he said.
Talal Shreif, mayor of the town of Yammouneh in the northern Bekaa, said that about 35,000 people in the region were being sought by the police for cannabis farming. 
What angers some people in the Bekaa is a feeling that they have little choice but to grow an illegal crop. 
Abu Abdo, 40, a resident of the nearby town of Brital who spent years in prison for a cannabis offence said it was high local unemployment that pushed farmers to grow a few square kilometers of the narcotic. 
""They bring some money in now, but it is not a solution. People are poor,"" he said. 
The mayor, Shreif, raised the possibility that if legalized cannabis farming might be regulated in the same way as tobacco, with the government buying the crop at a set price. 
Around his town, Yammouneh, there are about 1,500 square km of land used for cannabis farming, owned by about 150 local people who employ hundreds of casual Syrian laborers, he said. 
For now, there is little likelihood of a rapid move towards legalization. Nearly four months after a general election, Lebanon's political parties are still squabbling over the formation of a new coalition government. 
But in Bar Elias, a nearby town, farmers say they are struggling. One farmer, Khaled Araji, said his recent crop of vegetables had suffered catastrophically from drought. The river that watered it has gone dry. ""Not even a bird can drink from it,"" he said.
He said he would grow cannabis instead if the government allowed it.

""The farmers here don't want to be rich. They just want to be able to live through the winter and afford the school fees for their children.""

The men were killed after they opened fire on security forces who approached them in a mountainous area of the southern province of Assiut, the ministry said in a statement.
The forces found ammunition, weapons and organizational documents at the scene, it said. It did not identify the suspects nor say whether there had been any casualties or wounded among the security forces.
President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ordered the armed forces last November to defeat Islamist militants within three months after an attack on a mosque in Sinai killed more than 300 people.
Defeating the militants and restoring security after years of unrest has been a key promise of Sisi, who was re-elected in March in a landslide victory against no real opposition.
Sisi's critics accuse him of cracking down on all dissent, but supporters say tough measures are needed to stabilize Egypt, which was rocked by years of unrest after protests toppled veteran leader Hosni Mubarak in 2011.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's leading youth pro-democracy party, Demosisto, accused Chinese State Security agents of using ""scare tactics"" to intimidate two activists briefly detained for questioning earlier this year during visits to the mainland.
The Ministry of State Security couldn't be immediately reached for comment on the two incidents, while the Hong Kong government's Security Bureau gave no immediate response to a Reuters request for comment.
Demosisto withheld the names of the two party members, one of whom subsequently quit the party.
One was held for questioning for five hours during a visit to a city in China's southern Guangdong province earlier this month, and the other was questioned in March during a trip to another city in the same province.
""We're not just talking about a simple dialogue with no harm or no threat, we're talking about our members being detained with a hostile attitude,"" said Nathan Law, a founding member of Demosisto and an elected lawmaker who was disqualified from public office by authorities last July.
""It's definitely a scare tactic,"" he told reporters.
The activist held in the most recent incident had recounted how an agent had described Demosisto's advocacy of Hong Kong's right to self determination and greater autonomy as being akin to ""inciting subversion"". 
A copy of China's national security and counter-espionage laws was placed on the table during the interrogation, and the activist was persuaded to sign an ""apology letter"" before being released and allowed to return to Hong Kong.
In the incident in March, a Demosisto member was picked up in Guangzhou city and taken to a room in a hotel for questioning, before being allowed to return home.
""What we are afraid of is (that) under this kind of hardline of President Xi (Jinping), this kind of situation will be more common in future,"" said Demosisto leader Joshua Wong.
In recent years, pro-democracy groups in Hong Kong have decried what they see as China's Communist leaders' increased suppression of civil liberties and democratic reforms.
Earlier this month, China's Foreign Ministry publicly rebuked Hong Kong's Foreign Correspondents' Club (FCC) for inviting a pro-independence activist, Andy Chan, to give a speech at the club.
Calls have since grown from Chinese officials and pro-Beijing politicians for the city to enact tough new national security laws known as Article 23 legislation.
Hong Kong reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997 under a so-called ""one country, two systems"" arrangement which guarantees a high degree of autonomy.
Hong Kong-born citizens are allowed to travel freely into China on special ""re-entry"" permits, but many vocal critics of Beijing, and prominent democrats, are often barred from entering.

639,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2018 09:09AM ET</span>","Myanmar generals had 'genocidal intent' against Rohingya, must face justice: U.N.","By Stephanie Nebehay
GENEVA (Reuters) - Myanmar's military carried out mass killings and gang rapes of Muslim Rohingya with ""genocidal intent"" and the commander-in-chief and five generals should be prosecuted for the gravest crimes under international law, U.N. investigators said.
In a report, they called for the U.N. Security Council to set up an ad hoc tribunal to try suspects or refer them to the International Criminal Court in the Hague. The Security Council should also impose an arms embargo on Myanmar and targeted sanctions against individuals most responsible for crimes.
They blamed the country's de facto civilian leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, for failing to use her ""moral authority"" to protect civilians. Her government ""contributed to the commission of atrocity crimes"" by letting hate speech thrive, destroying documents and failing to shield minorities from crimes against humanity and war crimes.
The report also criticized Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) for allowing the world's biggest social media network to be used to incite violence and hatred. Facebook responded on Monday by announcing that it was blocking 20 Myanmar officials and organizations found by the U.N. panel to have ""committed or enabled serious human rights abuses"".
Contacted by phone, Myanmar military spokesman Major General Tun Tun Nyi said he could not immediately comment. The Myanmar government was sent an advance copy of the U.N. report in line with standard practice.
Zaw Htay, spokesman for Suu Kyi's government, could not immediately be reached for comment. Reuters was also unable to contact the six generals named in the report.
A year ago, government troops led a brutal crackdown in Myanmar's Rakhine state in response to attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) on 30 Myanmar police posts and a military base. Some 700,000 Rohingya fled the crackdown and most are now living in refugee camps in neighboring Bangladesh.
The U.N. report said the military action, which included the torching of villages, was ""grossly disproportionate to actual security threats"".
""The crimes in Rakhine State, and the manner in which they were perpetrated, are similar in nature, gravity and scope to those that have allowed genocidal intent to be established in other contexts,"" said the U.N. panel, known as the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar. 
Suu Kyi's government has rejected most allegations of atrocities made against the security forces by refugees. It has built transit centers for refugees to return, but U.N. aid agencies say it is not yet safe for them to do so.
MORAL AUTHORITY
Suu Kyi ""has not used her de facto position as Head of Government, nor her moral authority, to stem or prevent the unfolding events, or seek alternative avenues to meet a responsibility to protect the civilian population"", the report said.
The United Nations defines genocide as acts meant to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group in whole or in part. Such a designation is rare, but has been used in countries including Bosnia, Rwanda and Sudan.
In the final 20-page report, the panel said: ""There is sufficient information to warrant the investigation and prosecution of senior officials in the Tatmadaw (army) chain of command, so that a competent court can determine their liability for genocide in relation to the situation in Rakhine state.""
Marzuki Darusman, chair of the panel, said commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing should step down pending investigation.
""Accountability can only take place both from the point of view of the international community but also from the people of Myanmar if the single most significant factor is addressed. And that is the role of the commander-in-chief, Min Aung Hlaing.""
The list of generals also included Brigadier-General Aung Aung, commander of the 33rd Light Infantry Division, which oversaw operations in the coastal village of Inn Din where 10 Rohingya captive boys and men were killed.
That massacre was uncovered by two Reuters journalists - Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28 - who were arrested last December and are being tried on charges of violating Myanmar's Official Secrets Act. The court had been due to deliver a verdict on Monday, but at a brief hearing postponed the hearings until Sept. 3.
In April, seven soldiers were sentenced to 10 years in prison for participating in the Inn Din killings.
Other generals named in the report included army deputy commander-in-chief Vice Senior-General Soe Win; the commander of the Bureau of Special Operations-3, Lieutenant-General Aung Kyaw Zaw; the commander of Western Regional Military Command, Major-General Maung Maung Soe; and the commander of 99th Light Infantry Division, Brigadier-General Than Oo.
Panel member Christopher Sidoti said ""the clarity of the chain of command in Myanmar"" meant the six generals must be prosecuted, even in the absence of a ""smoking gun"" piece of evidence to prove who had ordered the crimes.
""We do not have a copy of a direct order that says 'undertake genocide tomorrow please'. But that is the case almost universally when cases of genocide have gone before the courts,"" Sidoti said.
Darusman said a wider confidential list of suspects included civilians and insurgents as well as members of the military.
""OPPRESSION FROM BIRTH TO DEATH""
The U.N. panel, set up last year, interviewed 875 victims and witnesses in Bangladesh and other countries, and analyzed documents, videos, photographs and satellite images.
Decades of state-sponsored stigmatization against Rohingya had resulted in ""institutionalized oppression from birth to death"", the report said. 
The Rohingya, who regard themselves as native to Rakhine state, are widely considered as interlopers by Myanmar's Buddhist majority and are denied citizenship.
""The Tatmadaw acts with complete impunity and has never been held accountable. Its standard response is to deny, dismiss and obstruct,"" the U.N. report said.
Members of the panel had accused Facebook in March of allowing its platform to be used to incite violence. The report said the social media company should have acted quicker.
""Although improved in recent months, Facebook's response has been slow and ineffective. The extent to which Facebook posts and messages have led to real-world discrimination and violence must be independently and thoroughly examined,"" it said.
In a statement announcing its action on Monday, Facebook said it was removing 18 Facebook accounts, one Instagram account and 52 Facebook pages.
""The ethnic violence in Myanmar has been truly horrific. Earlier this month, we shared an update on the steps we’re taking to prevent the spread of hate and misinformation on Facebook. While we were too slow to act, we’re now making progress – with better technology to identify hate speech, improved reporting tools, and more people to review content.""
Facebook had acknowledged in a statement issued 10 days ago following a Reuters investigative report into its failure to combat hate speech against the Rohingya and other Muslims in Myanmar that it had been ""too slow"" to address the problem.

645,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2018 08:10AM ET</span>",Congo trial over killings of U.N. experts resumes after long suspension,"By Aaron Ross
DAKAR (Reuters) - The trial of more than two dozen people, including a former intelligence agency informant, suspected in the killings of two U.N. sanctions monitors last year in central Congo resumed on Monday after a 10-month suspension, defense lawyers said.
Zaida Catalan, a Swede, and Michael Sharp, an American, were killed in March 2017 while investigating an armed conflict in Democratic Republic of Congo's Kasai region between government forces and the local Kamuina Nsapu militia. 
Congo's government has blamed their kidnappings and killings on the militia but some Western governments and rights groups suspect state officials may have been involved as Catalan and Sharp were conducting investigations in an area where the United Nations has accused Congo's military of war crimes.
Congolese government officials initially said no state agents were involved in the killings and that they did not know at the time that the two experts were in the region. But they later said they could not exclude the possibility state agents were involved. 
Among the 13 defendants appearing in court on Monday in the Kasai city of Kananga were suspected militia leaders Constantin Tshidime Bulabula and Vincent Manga, who were arrested earlier this year, Bulabula's lawyer Tresor Kabangu told Reuters.
Kabangu said Bulabula denies wrongdoing. Manga's lawyer, Moise Bidua, also says he denies the accusations against him.
Another dozen defendants are scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday to be identified, Kabangu said, including his client Jose Tshibuabua, who was arrested late last year. 
Reuters and Radio France Internationale (RFI) reported in December that Tshibuabua was working as an informant for Congo's national intelligence agency (ANR) when he helped Sharp and Catalan organize their trip to the town of Bunkonde. Kabangu says Tshibuabua denies any wrongdoing. 
According to phone logs in the Congolese prosecutor's file reviewed by Reuters and RFI, Tshibuabua exchanged dozens of text messages with a local ANR boss in the days before and after Sharp and Catalan were killed. 
Congo's top ANR official, Kalev Mutond, said Tshibuabua had repeatedly assured him during interrogation that he had not informed ANR officials about his contacts with the U.N. monitors and suggested Tshibuabua was acting on behalf of the militia. 
The trial began in June of last year. It was suspended in October pending the arrival of a team of U.N. experts meant to assist the investigation.
The experts have complained that Congolese security officials are interfering with their work, including by not granting access to key witnesses. Swedish prosecutors working the case also say Congolese authorities have not been cooperative.
Congo denies those accusations and says its justice system is conducting an impartial investigation. 
The conflict in previously peaceful Kasai erupted in August 2016 when Congolese forces killed a local chief who had been demanding their withdrawal from the region.

According to a U.N. report in June, both state forces and the militia committed atrocities that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity during the year-long conflict, in which up to 5,000 people died.

646,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2018 08:02AM ET</span>",Mahathir takes aim at Country Garden's giant development in southern Malaysia,"By Fathin Ungku and Joseph Sipalan
FOREST CITY/KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Monday declared that foreigners will not be granted visas to live in the giant Forest City real estate project on the country's southern tip, a major threat to the marketing strategy for the development.
It is not his first broadside against the plan by Chinese developer  Country Garden  Holdings Co (HK:2007) to create a new city that was envisaged to eventually house 700,000 people on reclaimed land near Singapore, but it could be his most damaging. The company has been targeting foreigners more than Malaysians for sales of the apartments.
A top official at the project told Reuters last week that in the weeks immediately after 93-year-old Mahathir came back into power, through a shock election victory in May, demand for the apartments had weakened, and that the uncertainty remained a concern.
Mahathir's latest comments are likely to exacerbate those concerns.
""One thing is certain, that city that is going to be built cannot be sold to foreigners,"" Mahathir said at a news conference on Monday in Kuala Lumpur in response to a question from Reuters. ""We are not going to give visas for people to come and live here.""
Mahathir, who was Malaysia's leader from 1981-2003, said the government's objection was ""because it was built for foreigners, not built for Malaysians. Most Malaysians are unable to buy those flats.""
Country Garden Pacificview Sdn Bhd, the joint venture between Country Garden and the Johor state government that is developing Forest City, said in a statement it is in touch with Mahathir's office as it seeks clarification. It said it believed Mahathir's comments ""may have been taken out of context in certain media reports"" as they do not correspond with the content of a meeting between the prime minister and Country Garden Holdings Chairman Yeung Kwok Keung.
In that meeting on August 16, Mahathir ""reiterated that he welcomes foreign investments which could create employment opportunities, promote technology transfer and innovations that could benefit Malaysia's economic growth and job creation,"" Country Garden Pacificview said.
It also said that it has complied with all Malaysian laws and regulations concerning approvals to sell to foreign purchasers.
Shares in Hong Kong-listed Country Garden, which rose as much as 3.9 percent on Monday morning, trimmed their gains to 2.5 percent after Mahathir's comments.
Country Garden Chinese buyers now make up about two-thirds of the owners of the Forest City apartments that have been sold so far, with 20 percent from Malaysia and the rest from 22 other countries including Indonesia, Vietnam and South Korea. 
Mahathir had capitalized on popular disquiet about Chinese investment pouring into Malaysia during his election campaign. He even suggested in a speech last December that he hoped Forest City would become an actual forest with baboons and monkeys as residents, according to local media reports.
Since becoming prime minister he has put the brakes on a number of China-backed projects, including the $20 billion East Coast Rail Link project and a natural gas pipeline project in Sabah. Plans for a high speed rail link from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore, which was expected to be a big boost to the Forest City project, have also been suspended.
""GHOST TOWN"" QUESTIONS
Forest City's sales have picked back up in recent weeks, and the developer has been seeking to change the project's image. Country Garden is trying to make it appear more Malaysian and less Chinese, according to the official, Ng Zhu Hann, who is head of strategy for Country Garden Forest City.
Country Garden is also willing to acknowledge for the first time that if demand does falter it will have to slow down the building of the development. It is eventually intended to be a $100 billion city, with apartment blocks, houses, office towers, hotels and shopping centers on four man-made islands.
""If the demand is there, we will build. If it's not there, we will slow down,"" Ng said in an interview at the gleaming Phoenix Hotel, one of the finished new structures on the first of the reclaimed islands. ""So there's no worry of a ghost town, oversupply - If the demand is not there, we won't be building.""
Mahathir's victory is the second big threat that the development - which is a partnership between Country Garden and the Sultan of Johor - has faced in the past couple of years. Beijing's moves to stem capital outflows imposed after the yuan plummeted in late 2016 hurt mainland Chinese demand for the apartments.
""CHINESE STIGMA""
Ng said what he called the ""Chinese Stigma"" is the biggest hurdle facing the project.
""What the Malaysian government does not want is a Chinese enterprise coming to Malaysia, taking government contracts, affecting the project opportunities of local developers, making the money and going back,"" Ng said. 
This has prompted a change in hiring strategy as Forest City seeks to recruit more Malaysians like Ng into senior management positions.
""My predecessor was a Chinese. In the past, our management had only one Malaysian, which was head of legal. This (my) position is usually held by a Chinese, but now I'm here,"" said Ng, who is ethnic Chinese but from Malaysia.
Ng said that the political uncertainty had hurt investor sentiment.
""It's not that people don't want to invest, but people are now: 'Let's wait and see. What if they change their policy again?' Political stability is one, policy stability is another.""
After Mahathir's comments, Ng defended the local nature of the project.
“There are many Malaysians in this project,” Ng told Reuters. “1,100 out of 1,545 of the total workforce are Malaysians.""
SKYSCRAPERS ABOVE MANGROVES
At the end of a thirty-minute drive from the crossing from Singapore through palm oil plantations and jungle, the once sleepy town of Gelang Patah known for its mangroves and fishing villages now has a skyline of skyscrapers. 
This futuristic development is only half of the first of four man-made islands envisioned for the development - only 2.7 square kilometers of the planned reclamation of 20 square kilometers. 
Work to build more high rise residential towers, town houses and commercial buildings is continuing full steam, with dozens of heavy duty trucks carrying sand and materials while cranes dot a skyline that is growing taller and denser as high-rise apartments rapidly approach completion. 
Forest City is barely inhabited, with only a handful of staff living at its service apartments and guests at its hotel.
But earlier this month, an international school opened its doors to the first 60 students - mostly from China and also from South Korea - to its 22-acre campus planted with ""vertical gardens,"" an Olympic-size pool and three yoga studios. 
They will be knocking about the Shattuck St Mary's school campus designed to accommodate 1,000 students as construction roars on in the backdrop. 
Liang Ri Sheng, 44, who runs an electrical services company in Guangzhou, said he hopes Forest City will be the gateway for his son to an international life, riding on the strength of China's Belt and Road regional infrastructure push.
""It will give both eastern and western exposure for my son. I think it's good for my son's growth and development,"" Liang told Reuters. He was speaking before Mahathir's latest remarks.
His family will be one of the first 482 to get the keys to their new homes by September.
Another buyer, Jackie Chan (not related to the actor of the same name), who bought an apartment in Forest City last year for around $140,000, said he hadn't expected such a twist.
""When I bought it I was betting on long-term appreciation and didn’t expect there would be such a policy risk. But I’m not aiming for their immigration visa so there’s no impact for me. The investment amount is small so I’m just going to keep it as a vacation home,"" said Chan, who lives in Hong Kong.

Tehran has suggested it could take military action in the Gulf to block other countries' oil exports in retaliation for U.S. sanctions intended to halt its sales of crude. Washington maintains a fleet in the Gulf that protects oil shipping routes.
Tangsiri said Iran had full control of the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz that leads into it. Closing the strait would be the most direct way of blocking shipping.
""We can ensure the security of the Persian Gulf and there is no need for the presence of aliens like the U.S. and the countries whose home is not in here,"" he said in the quote, which appeared in English translation on Tasnim.
He added, ""All the carriers and military and non-military ships will be controlled and there is full supervision over the Persian Gulf. Our presence in the region is physical and constant and night and day.""
Separately, the head of the Revolutionary Guards, Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, said Iran's enemies would not prevail in a conflict.
""The enemies are strictly avoiding any conflict with Iran because they know that it will not be beneficial for them,"" Jafari said, according to Tasnim. 
Tension between Iran and the United States has escalated since President Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers in May and reimposed sanctions.
Senior U.S. officials have said they aim to reduce Iran's oil exports to zero.

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the most senior authority in the Islamic Republic, said last month that he supports the idea that if Iran is not allowed to export oil then no country should export oil from the Gulf.

The German government, trying to repair its own strained relationship with Riyadh, has been silent on the spat between Canada and Saudi Arabia, drawing criticism from some politicians and rights groups.
Chrystia Freeland, speaking at an annual gathering of German ambassadors in Berlin, did not specifically mention Saudi Arabia in her address. However, she touched indirectly on the row which was triggered by her tweet demanding the release of jailed human rights activists in the kingdom.
In response, Riyadh has frozen new trade with Canada, expelled the Canadian ambassador and ended state-backed educational and medical programs in Canada.
Freeland said Canada would always stand up for human rights ""even when we are told to mind our own business ... and even when speaking up brings consequences"".
She added: ""We count on and hope for Germany's support.""
Ties between Berlin and Riyadh have been strained since former foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel denounced ""adventurism"" in the Middle East in November of last year, comments that were seen as criticism of Riyadh's actions in the region.
Saudi Arabia withdrew its ambassador to Berlin and, since early 2018, has excluded German healthcare companies from public tenders.
Riyadh is at loggerheads with many European countries which have criticized its intervention in Yemen's civil war and support dialogue with its arch-enemy Iran.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas stressed at the conference Europe and Canada's shared interest in preserving a ""rules-based international order"" in the face of U.S. President Donald Trump's unilateralism.
""It hits Europe and Germany when the United States, suddenly and without consulting, introduces random sanctions against Russia, China, Turkey and in the future perhaps more of our important trading partners,"" he said.

Europe needed to become more autonomous in order to defend its commercial and trade interests, Maas said. ""It won't be easy,"" he added.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison will meet Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Friday for talks on their ""bilateral relationship, including economic cooperation, and other regional issues"", said ministry spokesman, Arrmanatha Nasir.
Morrison was sworn in on Friday after emerging the surprise winner in an internal leadership challenge in his party.
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported on Sunday he is expected to announce that the two countries are on the brink of signing a free trade agreement (FTA).
Nasir said he could not confirm if Widodo and Morrison would discuss the FTA. An Australian embassy spokesman said he could not confirm Morrison's visit to Jakarta.
Morrison's predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull, had been scheduled to travel to Jakarta in September. He and Widodo had set a target of completing the free trade negotiations last year.
Separately on Monday, Indonesia's coordinating minister of economic affairs, Darmin Nasution, said the substance of the trade deal had been agreed on, but he could not confirm when it would be signed.
Despite being close geographically, Australia was only the 14th-biggest buyer of Indonesian exports in 2017, while Indonesia was the 10th-largest export destination for Australia, according to the International Monetary Fund data.

Boosting exports, including by securing market access for Indonesian products through FTAs, is a priority for Widodo's government as it tries to put a floor under the falling rupiah currency.

HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam has ordered police and military forces in the capital, Hanoi, to prevent big gatherings or protests during its National Day holiday next month, the Hanoi People's Committee said on Monday.
Freedom of assembly is legal in the Communist-ruled country, but despite sweeping reforms, communist-ruled Vietnam tolerates little dissent. Protesters and activists are often prevented from gathering or charged with ""causing public disorder"".
""(The authorities) should closely monitor and take efficient measures to prevent people from gathering and protesting in the city,"" Hanoi chairman Nguyen Duc Chung said in a statement on the Hanoi People's Committee website.
Police and military officials should step up security and safety measures at cultural and entertainment sites before, during and after National Day on Sept. 2, Chung said.
The committee did not say what issues it thought might lead to protests.
In June, police arrested dozens of people during at times violent nationwide protests triggered by fears that plans for a new law on special economic zones would be dominated by Chinese investors.
The law has yet to be ratified. Protests have also taken place over the past year or so against pollution and what people see as unfair land grabs.
Last week, a court in the southern commercial hub of Ho Chi Minh City, jailed two Vietnamese-Americans loyal to the now defunct state of South Vietnam for masterminding a series of bomb plots. 
Police said the pair had planned to launch more bomb attacks on public holidays.
Hanoi will also host several regional heads of state at a World Economic Forum conference about the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) on Sept. 11-13, in what will be Vietnam's biggest diplomatic gathering this year.

654,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2018 05:21AM ET</span>",Police search for motive in Florida mass shooting,"(Reuters) - Police searched on Monday for a motive in the third mass shooting in Florida in two years, which left two people dead and 11 wounded in Jacksonville, before the gunman killed himself at a video game tournament.
Witnesses told local media that the gunman, identified by police as David Katz, 24, of Baltimore, was a disgruntled gamer, angry because he lost Sunday's tournament. It was not clear if he knew his victims.
While police have not identified the victims, family members told Jacksonville CBS television station WJAX that the two people killed were Eli Clayton and Taylor Robertson, both were video game contestants.
The Miami Herald also identified the victims: Robertson, 27, of Ballard, West Virginia, and Clayton, 22, of Woodland Hills, California.
Robertson, a husband and father, was the winner of the tournament last year and Katz won it the year before, the Herald reported, citing family and friends posting on the Internet.
The Jacksonville Sheriff's office said 11 other people were wounded by gunfire and at least two others were injured while fleeing the scene of Sunday's shooting.
Police say Katz killed himself and his body was found near the bodies of the two shot dead at The Landing, a popular riverside shopping and restaurant spot in Jacksonville.
Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams declined Sunday to comment on possible reasons for the attack.
Police and FBI agents swarmed Katz's upscale townhouse in South Baltimore late on Sunday, multiple media accounts said, including the Baltimore Sun.
Police also seized Katz's vehicle parked nearby the tournament site.
The shooting took place during a regional qualifier for the Madden 19 online game tournament at the GLHF Game Bar inside a pizza restaurant, according to the venue's website. 
The winners of the contest go forward to the video game finals in Las Vegas and compete for $165,000.
The latest rampage occurred amid a debate over U.S. gun laws that was given fresh impetus by the massacre in February of 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Florida. 
Two years ago a gunman killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando.
President Donald Trump has been briefed and is monitoring the situation in Jacksonville, the White House said.
GAME LIVESTREAMED
The bar was livestreaming a football video game competition when the gunfire started, according to video shared on social media. In the video, players can be seen reacting to the shots and cries can be heard before the footage cuts off.
Taylor Poindexter and her boyfriend, Marquis Williams, had traveled from Chicago to attend the tournament, and they fled when the gunfire erupted. She said she saw Katz take aim at his victims.
""We did see him, two hands on the gun, walking back, just popping rounds,"" Poindexter told reporters. ""I was scared for my life and my boyfriend's.""
Another gamer, Chris ""Dubby"" McFarland, was hospitalized after a bullet grazed his head. ""I feel fine, just a scratch on my head. Traumatized and devastated,"" he wrote on Twitter.
The sheriff's office said many people were transported to hospital, and its deputies found many others hiding in locked areas at The Landing.
A spokesman for Jacksonville's Memorial Hospital said it was treating three victims, all of whom were in stable condition. The conditions of other patients was not available early Monday.
Reacting to news of the shooting during the tournament involving its game, Madden 19 maker  Electronic Arts Inc  (NASDAQ:EA) said it was working with authorities to gather facts.

""The tragic situation that occurred Sunday in Jacksonville was a senseless act of violence that we strongly condemn,"" a company spokesperson said to Reuters late on Sunday. ""Our most heartfelt sympathies go out to the families of the victims whose lives were taken today and those who were injured.""

656,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2018 05:12AM ET</span>","Driven from home, White Helmet rescuers start over in north Syria","By Khalil Ashawi
AZAZ, Syria (Reuters) - Syrian rescue worker Samir Salim found his mother's body under their collapsed house, but there was no time for a funeral. 
""We buried her and went back to work. There were a lot of people under the rubble,"" he said. Months later, he can no longer even visit her grave. 
When Syrian government forces clawed back his eastern Ghouta hometown, near the capital Damascus, Salim followed hundreds of thousands of others who had fled to the northwest under rebel surrender deals. 
Now, he and ""White Helmet"" workers driven from different parts of Syria have come together in the rebel-controlled town of Azaz to try to rebuild their lives near the Turkish border. 
Their work has changed drastically: with no warplanes cruising overhead, they help the opposition authorities put out fires, clean the streets, and plant trees. 
Azaz falls within a de facto buffer zone which Turkey has carved out since 2016. The northwest corner remains Syria's last major insurgent stronghold and is now in President Bashar al-Assad's crosshairs.
The White Helmets have often said they worried about reprisals as government forces defeated rebel enclaves with Russian and Iranian help. 
The civil defense service, which receives funding from Western governments, pulls people from the rubble of air strikes in rebel territory. Assad has accused it of being a Western-sponsored front for al Qaeda's branch in Syria. 
""NEW LIFE, FOREIGN PLACE"" 
Salim said many comrades stayed behind in eastern Ghouta. 
Before leaving, he helped burn down the emergency center he had once helped establish in his town, where his three brothers also worked. 
As buses shuttled evacuees out through government territory, including Salim's wife, five children, and relatives, some people cursed and threw stones at them, he added. 
""We arrived with great misery,"" said Salim, 45. ""Our peers gave us an exceptional welcome.""
Azaz is worlds apart from Ghouta, which lived through years of bitter siege and air strikes - far from the Turkish influence of the northwest. 
Salim recalled a sarin gas attack that killed hundreds of people in 2013 in the rebel enclave. ""People were running down the streets screaming 'chemicals' and there were a lot of civilians lying in the streets foaming at the mouth."" 
He said he injured his spleen during an air strike on a market in 2016 and had part of his intestines removed. 
The White Helmet first responders say Damascus has specifically targeted them during the more than seven-year conflict. The government says it only targets militants. 
""We fear building a new life in a foreign place and then having to leave once again,"" Salim said. ""I fear northern Syria will face what we did in Ghouta."" 
His family now lives in the nearby Afrin region, where a Turkish assault earlier this year ousted Syrian Kurdish fighters. Those forces have accused Turkey of expelling Afrin's residents to resettle other people, which Ankara denies. 
""HARSHER TIMES""
Salim's new team includes Ahmed Rashid, 30, who was bussed out of eastern Aleppo two years ago after fighter jets leveled entire districts. 
The bloody battle for Aleppo in northern Syria marked a turning point in the war as pro-government forces swept through the insurgent half of the city. Rashid said 12 friends from his center in Aleppo were killed. 
""Nobody expected me to persevere, especially since my parents are in Turkey. But I cannot leave the civil defense,"" the former shoe designer said. 
""In Aleppo, the bombing was so heavy we couldn't sleep. ""Here (in Azaz), there is no such pressure.""
Nayef al-Aboud, also part of the same team, said they largely work on services like helping with car accidents. 

""Today, our center has workers from the displaced populations,"" said Aboud, 22, who is from Azaz. ""Our strength has grown because they are here, we learn from their experiences, they lived through harsher times.""

HANOI (Reuters) - U.S. Senator John McCain was a ""symbol of his generation"" who helped ""heal the wounds of war"" by pushing for diplomatic normalization of ties with Vietnam, the Southeast Asian country's foreign minister said on Monday.
McCain, a former prisoner of war in Vietnam who ran for president in 2008 as a self-styled maverick Republican and became a prominent critic of President Donald Trump, died on Saturday. He was 81.
""For both the government of Vietnam and its people, Senator McCain was a symbol of his generation of senators, and of the veterans of the Vietnam war,"" Vietnam's foreign minister Pham Binh Minh wrote in a condolence book at the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi on Monday.
""It was he who took the lead in significantly healing the wounds of war, and normalizing and promoting the comprehensive Vietnam-U.S. partnership,"" Minh said.
McCain had been one of the most vocal proponents in Washington in favor of normalizing times with Communist-led Vietnam, a former enemy of the United States.
His public relationship with the Southeast Asian country began as a naval aviator during the Vietnam War, when his plane was shot down during a bombing mission over Hanoi in 1967.
He suffered two broken arms, a broken leg, and was stabbed and beaten after being dragged from a lake on the edge of the downtown area of the city. He spent years as a prisoner of war at Hoa Lo prison - or the ""Hanoi Hilton"", as it was known to American soldiers.
A monument on the shores of the Hanoi lake where McCain was captured has turned into a de facto shrine to the late senator since news of his death reached Vietnam early on Sunday morning.
Both Vietnamese people and U.S. citizens in Hanoi have flocked to the grey, concrete monument to offer flowers, incense, flags and other tributes to McCain.

""Condolences to senator and war veteran John McCain, who greatly contributed to the normalization of Vietnam-U.S. relations,"" said one message in Vietnamese, left at the sculpture attached to a bouquet of flowers on Monday.

North Korea had decided to expel the tourist, who had been detained and investigated for an unspecified crime, the state-run Korean Central News Agency said at the weekend.
""There are various procedures to complete till his return to Japan,"" Kyodo quoted a Japanese government source as saying. The man was expected to return home soon, the agency added.
Tomoyuki Sugimoto, who is believed to be a videographer from the prefecture of Shiga in central Japan, had apparently been caught filming a military facility in Nampo city, Kyodo and other Japanese media have said.
""The relevant institution of the DPRK decided to leniently condone him and expel him from the DPRK on the principle of humanitarianism,"" KCNA said in its weekend report, using an abbreviation of the North's official name.
Earlier on Monday, Japan said it was aware of the KCNA item.
""The government is putting in all its effort, but we refrain from commenting on details due to the nature of the issue,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference.
In Beijing, when asked if she could confirm the man had arrived in China, Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry, said she had ""no understanding"" of the case.
In early August, Japanese media said government officials were trying to gather information on a man who had been detained in North Korea.
Japan has demanded that North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons and missile programs and has also sought the return of citizens kidnapped by the isolated state during the 1970s and 1980s.
It has said it will not provide economic aid to Pyongyang until that issue is resolved and normal diplomatic ties established.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison became Australia's sixth leader in less than a decade on Friday after a faction of his Liberal party drove the ouster of Malcolm Turnbull but then failed to get its candidate elected leader.
The ruling Liberal-National coalition's primary vote dropped four points to 33 percent, a Newspoll showed, while the two-party-preferred split between the opposition Labor party and the coalition blew out from 51-49 in favor of Labor two weeks ago to 56-44, which would translate into a heavy election defeat.
The Newspoll, published by The Australian newspaper, also showed Labor leader Bill Shorten was now preferred prime minister among voters. The next election is due by May 2019.
Morrison, a Turnbull supporter, promised a new generation of leadership, and an end to political infighting.
""Australians expect that of their parliament and I'm pleased that's the case,"" Morrison told reporters when asked about comments from former prime minister Tony Abbott, a leader of the conservative faction that ousted Turnbull, that the ""era of the political assassin is over"".
""The age of bitterness has come to a close, and the age of working together and focusing on the future has come,"" Morrison said on his visit to Quilpie, a small outback town about 1,000 km (620 miles) west of Brisbane, capital of Queensland state.
Morrison's new cabinet included a number of ministers who were involved in Turnbull's ouster, taken as a sign he was trying to unite the party. However, there was no ministerial role for Abbott, currently a backbencher.
Among the reappointments was Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton, who challenged Turnbull for the leadership last week.
Morrison has a one-seat majority, but will face a by-election as Turnbull plans to leave parliament soon. A second by-election may be called if former foreign minister Julie Bishop, who lost her leadership bid last Friday, quits parliament before the next election. 
Voter anger at the leadership change lit up social media websites and newspaper letters pages on Monday, with some voters calling for an early election so they can decide who runs the country.
""For the benefit of all Australians, and for the benefit of democracy, call an election, Mr Morrison,"" wrote Ben J. on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) news website.
Donna C, also on the ABC website said that Morrison's government had ""just lost my vote"".
""The demeaning of the office of PM has to stop. If your own party cannot respect the office, then how do you expect the Australian people to respect it?"" she wrote.

The project has faced uncertainty since Mahathir's coalition scored a shock victory at a May general election, as developer Country Garden Holdings Co looks to revive faltering demand for a city planned to be home to 700,000 people.
""One thing is certain, that city that is going to be built cannot be sold to foreigners,"" Mahathir told a news conference in Kuala Lumpur, the capital.
""We are not going to give visas for people to come and live here,"" he added. ""Our objection is because it was built for foreigners, not built for Malaysians. Most Malaysians are unable to buy those flats.""
A Country Garden official said the company did not have any immediate response to Mahathir's comments.
Opposition to the project helped drive Mahathir's election campaign, during which he called it, and other Chinese-backed projects, evidence of his predecessor selling Malaysia to China.
Malaysians living in Johor complained of large numbers of Chinese people snapping up properties in Forest City, besides concerns of environmental damage, a glut in the property market, and the impact of land reclamation on fisheries.

Country Garden has developed just a fraction of the planned reclamation of 20 sq km (8 sq miles), where Chinese nationals accounted for about 70 percent of apartment buyers last year.

663,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2018 12:50AM ET</span>","China targets rumors, religion in updated party rules","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's ruling Communist Party has issued a revised set of regulations governing members' behavior, threatening punishment for spreading political rumors and recommending those who cling to religious beliefs be asked to leave the party.
President Xi Jinping's on-going crackdown against deep-rooted corruption, begun six years ago when he took office, has shaken up the party, with Xi warning, like other leaders before him, that the party's very survival is at stake.
Xi has accrued more power than any of his immediate predecessors and has intensified efforts to ensure cadres are loyal, disciplined, upright and honest.
The updated discipline rules, released late on Sunday by the graft watchdog the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection but in effect from Aug. 18, put into written form many orders that are in practice already in effect.
In the most serious cases where a law has been broken, party members can be prosecuted, but in many cases the most severe punishment that can be meted out is expulsion from the party.
Xi's name has also been written into the revised rules, as it is already in the party and country's constitution, putting him at the very center of party life.
Party members are not allowed to speak out against central party policies or decisions, and nor can they spread ""political rumors or damage the party's unity"", the new rules say.
""Party members and officials must correctly exercise the power granted them by the people, be clean and upright, and oppose any abuse of power or behavior that seeks personal benefit,"" one new clause says.
Another new clause takes aim at party members who are also religious. While the country's constitution guarantees freedom of religion the party is officially atheist and party members are supposed to be too.
""Party members who have religious belief should have strengthened thought education. If they still don't change after help and education from the party organization, they should be encouraged to leave the party,"" the new rules say.
Those who attend ""activities that use religion for incitement"" will be expelled, according to the rules.
Another new clause calls for punishment who ""distort"" the history of the country, rather than just party or military history as before.

History is a sensitive subject in China as so much of the party's legitimacy rests on its position as claiming great historical achievements, such as leading China to victory over Japan before and during World War Two.

U.S. President Donald Trump abruptly canceled his top diplomat's planned trip to North Korea on Friday, publicly acknowledging for the first time that his effort to get Pyongyang to denuclearize had stalled since his summit with the North's leader.
South Korea's presidential Blue House spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom said on Monday that the canceled visit ""cannot be said to have zero effect"" on the plan for the liaison office. 
""We were thinking of the opening of the liaison office as part of a smooth series of schedules including Secretary of State Pompeo's North Korea visit then the inter-Korean summit,"" Kim said. ""Now that a new situation has arisen, there is a need to inspect it again accordingly."" 
South Korea has been building a liaison office just over the border in North Korea, as part of efforts championed by the South's President Moon Jae-in to improve ties between the two Koreas. 
The office, which the South Korean government said planned to open by August, had raised concern among opposition lawmakers, analysts and local media that the transfer of material for the office could violate U.N. and U.S. sanctions against North Korea. 
South Korea's Unification Ministry spokesman on Monday repeated its stance that all the material for the liaison office are for the office's operation and the convenience of South Korean personnel, and does not give any economic gain to North Korea.
The spokesman added the two Koreas continue to discuss matters such as the timing of the office's opening, after agreeing to open it ""soon"". 
""This issue is not something that our government can decide on its own, but must be discussed with the North,"" said Kim, the Blue House spokesman. ""I understand that there hasn't been official discussion on how the North sees such situational changes, changes in conditions."" 
North Korea's state-controlled newspaper on Sunday accused the United States of ""double-dealing"" and ""hatching a criminal plot"" against Pyongyang, but did not mention Pompeo's canceled visit. 
Since the June summit, the two sides have struggled to narrow differences over the North’s nuclear weapons program. 
Pyongyang has been calling for a declaration of peace as part of security guarantees designed to encourage it to abandon its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, while the Trump administration says a peace deal and other concessions will only come after more progress on denuclearization. 
The inter-Korean summit slated for September remains on track, and President Moon's role as mediator between the U.S. and North Korea appears to have expanded after the canceled visit, Blue House's Kim told reporters on Sunday.

Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, are charged with breaching the Official Secrets Act, which carries a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison.
Follow latest updates on detained reporters  https://www.reuters.com/subjects/myanmar-reporters
The court in Yangon has been holding hearings since January. The reporters and one police witness for the prosecution have testified that they were set up by police to block or punish them for their reporting of a mass killing of Rohingya Muslims.
The verdict will be delivered amid growing pressure on Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her government over an army crackdown that began last August. Around 700,000 Rohingya have since fled the western state of Rakhine to neighboring Bangladesh, according to United Nations agencies. 
Soldiers are accused of mass killings, rape, and arson in a campaign the U.N. has called a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"". 
Myanmar denies most of the allegations, but has acknowledged the killing of 10 Rohingya men and boys by troops and Buddhist civilians in the village of Inn Din that the two Reuters reporters had been investigating when they were arrested.
During eight months of hearings, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo have testified that two policemen they had not met before handed them papers rolled up inside a newspaper during a meeting at a Yangon restaurant on Dec. 12. Almost immediately afterwards, they said, they were bundled into a car by plainclothes officers.
In April, Police Captain Moe Yan Naing testified that a senior officer had ordered his subordinates to plant secret documents on Wa Lone to ""trap"" the reporter.
Other police witnesses have told court the reporters were searched at a routine traffic stop by officers who were unaware they were journalists and found to be holding secret documents from an unknown source.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - A referendum vote on seven anti-corruption measures failed to meet quorum in Colombia on Sunday, nullifying the results even though each of the measures, including a reduction in lawmakers' salaries and term limits for public posts, got at least 99 percent support.
Corruption has become a hot topic in the country in recent years as security has improved and Colombians have increasingly turned their attention to headline-grabbing cases, including vote-buying, graft to obtain public contracts and the extradition of the country's anti-corruption czar for allegedly taking bribes.
Graft costs the country $17 billion a year, equivalent to 5.3 percent of GDP, the country's comptroller has said. 
To be valid each question needed just over 12.1 million votes cast. With nearly 100 percent reporting, just 11.6 million people had voted, under a third of the 36.4 million eligible voters.
Each of the seven questions, including bans on house arrest sentences for corruption, forcing elected officials to publish tax returns and a three-term limit on lawmakers, had more than 99 percent support.
Voters also backed limiting monthly salaries for lawmakers and other high-ranking officials to the equivalent of 25 minimum salaries, or nearly $6,600. Lawmakers currently earn more than $10,500 per month, compared with a minimum wage of about $260.
""Yes"" was supported by many leftist and centrist lawmakers. A faux reggaeton video starring politicians backing ""Yes"" was widely shared on social media this week.
Right-wing President Ivan Duque, who has promised to clamp down on graft with term limits and stiffer sentences, supported the referendum and has called corruption a ""cancer.""
However, several members of his party, including ex-president and current senator Alvaro Uribe, who is his mentor, said they preferred to support anti-corruption proposals in Congress instead.
Uribe, whose administration was dogged by corruption probes, is under investigation by the Supreme Court for alleged witness tampering and bribery.
Supporters of the vote said it showed Colombians were fed up with scandals and wanted to hold politicians accountable.
""We were five cents short, but this has shaken the traditional political class,"" Angelica Lozano, a Green party senator who backed ""Yes"" said on local radio. ""Citizens want a real and genuine change.""
""Yes"" lawmakers will present a suite of laws based on the seven measures this week, the campaign said.
In a televised speech late on Sunday, Duque urged lawmakers to support anti-corruption reforms and citizens to report graft.

""Together we'll defeat those who ransack public resources, together we'll build the future that Colombia deserves,"" he said.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (Reuters) - A video gamer killed two people and wounded several others on Sunday when he opened fire with a handgun at a tournament that was being streamed online from a restaurant in Jacksonville, Florida, police said.
Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams named the shooter as David Katz, 24, of Baltimore and said he was in town for the competition. He declined to comment on what led to the third major mass shooting to hit Florida in the last two years.
Williams said Katz killed himself after the shooting and that his body was found along with those of his two victims. The sheriff's office said 11 people were wounded by gunfire, and at least two others were injured while fleeing the scene.
Dozens of ambulances and police cars flooded into The Jacksonville Landing, a waterfront dining, entertainment and shopping site in the city's downtown, after several shots rang out on a sunny Sunday afternoon.
The shooting took place during a regional qualifier for the Madden 19 online game tournament at the GLHF Game Bar inside a Chicago Pizza restaurant, according to the venue's website.
The bar was livestreaming the football video game competition when the gunfire started, according to video of the stream shared on social media. In the video, players can be seen reacting to the shots and cries can be heard before the footage cuts off.
Taylor Poindexter and her boyfriend, Marquis Williams, had traveled from Chicago to attend the tournament, and they fled when the gunfire erupted. She said she saw Katz take aim at his victims.
""We did see him, two hands on the gun, walking back, just popping rounds,"" Poindexter told reporters. ""I was scared for my life and my boyfriend's.""
One Twitter user, Drini Gjoka, said he was taking part in the tournament and was shot in the thumb. 
""Worst day of my life,"" Gjoka wrote on Twitter. ""I will never take anything for granted ever again. Life can be cut short in a second.""
Another gamer, Chris ""Dubby"" McFarland, was hospitalized after a bullet grazed his head. ""I feel fine, just a scratch on my head. Traumatized and devastated,"" he wrote on Twitter.
HOME SEARCHED IN BALTIMORE
Local media said the shooter had been competing in the tournament and lost, then apparently targeted other players before killing himself.
The sheriff's office said the FBI was assisting them in Baltimore, and The Baltimore Sun reported that agents were at a home in South Baltimore in connection with the investigation.
A Baltimore City police spokesman, TJ Smith, said the department was assisting partner law enforcement agencies with information that led them to Baltimore. 
The latest rampage occurred amid a debate over U.S. gun laws that was given fresh impetus by the massacre in February of 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Florida. 
Two years ago a gunman killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando.
The sheriff's office said many people were transported to hospital, and its deputies found many others hiding in locked areas at The Landing.
Six victims were taken to Jacksonville's UF Health Hospital, five of them in stable condition and one in serious condition, hospital staff said.
A spokesman for Jacksonville's Memorial Hospital said it was treating three victims, all of whom were in stable condition.
Jacksonville, on Florida's Atlantic Coast, is about 35 miles south of the Georgia state line.
Florida Governor Rick Scott, a Republican who is challenging longtime Democratic Senator Bill Nelson in November's election, said he had offered to provide local authorities with any state resources they might need.
""Word of another tragic mass shooting in our state brings shock and outrage,"" Nelson said on Twitter.
Marco Rubio, U.S. senator from Florida, said both the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were coordinating with local authorities to provide assistance.
President Donald Trump has been briefed and is monitoring the situation in Jacksonville, the White House said.
Reacting to news of the shooting during the tournament involving its game, Madden 19 maker  Electronic Arts Inc  (NASDAQ:EA) said it was working with authorities to gather facts.

""This is a horrible situation, and our deepest sympathies go out to all involved,"" the company said on Twitter.

(Reuters) - Top figures from the professional U.S. online gaming community expressed shock and dismay on Sunday after a shooting at a tournament in Florida left three people dead.
The rampage took place at the GLHF Game Bar in downtown Jacksonville, which was livestreaming a regional qualifier for a new football video game, Madden NFL 19. 
Police named the shooter as 24-year-old David Katz from Baltimore, Maryland, and said he was in Jacksonville for the competition. They said he killed two people before taking his own life, but declined to comment on his motive.
The killings rocked the world of professional electronic gaming, also known as esports, which boasts an estimated 250 million players worldwide in a growing market worth about a billion dollars a year.
""My heart goes out to the family, friends and people affected by the madden shooting today,"" one video platform streamer and Internet personality, Ninja, wrote on Twitter. ""Evil times we live in, just need to out shine that evil with positivity.""
Another high profile gamer, @ProblemWright, one of the top names in Madden competitions according to its maker,  Electronic Arts Inc  (O:EA), said he was crying and ""in so much pain.""
""All over a videogame. Two of our brothers are gone man and its so disturbing. One of the most tragic days ive experienced. This community is like family. Broken,"" he wrote on Twitter.
Cloud9, a professional gaming organization based in Los Angeles, California, said it was deeply saddened and shocked by the tragic events: ""Our hearts and deepest condolences go out to the victims, families, and all those affected by today's violence,"" the organization said on Twitter. ""Stay safe.""
The victims have not yet been officially named, but another professional Madden player, @ThePrxdigyy, tweeted photos of two gamers who were reported on social media to have been killed.
""RIP to two of our brothers and speedy recovery for the others injured,"" he wrote. ""Love you all and hope something like this never happens again.""
Marquis Williams said he traveled from Chicago with his girlfriend to attend the competition. 

""I just can't wrap my head around the fact we were here traveling just to play video games, something that we love to do, and it's just sad that lives were lost because of it,"" Williams told reporters at the scene.

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Iranian lawyers will ask the International Court of Justice on Monday to order the United States to lift sanctions ordered by the Trump administration against Tehran.
The lawsuit filed with the ICJ, also known as the World Court, says the U.S. sanctions, which are damaging its already weak economy, violate terms of a little-known 1955 friendship treaty between the two countries.
The United States, which will respond formally in oral arguments on Tuesday, has yet to issue a public response. 
U.S. lawyers are expected to argue that the United Nations court should not have jurisdiction in the dispute, that the friendship treaty is no longer valid and that the sanctions Washington has levied against Tehran do not violate it anyway.
The oral hearings, essentially a request by Iran for a provisional ruling, will last for four days, with a decision to follow within a month. 
The ICJ is the United Nations tribunal for resolving international disputes. Its rulings are binding, but it has no power to enforce them and on rare occasions they have been ignored by some countries, including the United States.
U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear pact between Iran and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, with his administration then announcing unilateral plans to restore sanctions against Tehran.
Under the 2015 deal, which Trump sees as flawed, Iran reined in its disputed nuclear program under U.N. monitoring and won a removal of international sanctions in return.
Although the United States' European allies have protested against Trump's move, most Western companies intend to adhere to the sanctions, preferring to lose business in Iran than be punished by the United States or barred from doing business there.
The ICJ has so far ruled that the 1955 treaty is still valid, even though it was signed long before the 1979 Islamic Revolution that triggered decades of hostile relations with Washington.

Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was arrested in April 2016 at a Tehran airport as she was heading back to Britain with her two-year-old daughter after a family visit.
She was convicted of plotting to overthrow Iran's clerical establishment, a charge denied by her family and the Foundation, a charity organization that is independent of Thomson Reuters and operates independently of Reuters News.
Her husband Richard Ratcliffe, who is in Britain, said in a statement she returned to prison in Tehran to continue serving her sentence despite hopes her release would be extended.
Iranian authorities and her lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment.
Britain's foreign minister Jeremy Hunt wrote on Twitter that attempts to free Zaghari-Ratcliffe would continue.

Charged with being a member of a terrorist organization and publishing terrorist propaganda, German citizen Tolu was one of tens of thousands of civil servants and journalists detained after the attempt to depose President Tayyip Erdogan.
""I may be here today, but hundreds of colleagues, opposition activists, lawyers, students - 70,000 students are in prison - are still not free,"" she told reporters at Stuttgart airport after arriving from Istanbul. 
""So I can't be really happy about leaving the country where I was in prison because I know that nothing has changed there.""
Tolu described how masked armed police officers stormed her home in the middle of the night in April last year, waking her sleeping son and subjecting her to abuse as they searched the apartment before arresting her. 
Her husband Suat Corlu is still in prison in Turkey on terrorism charges brought after the attempted coup and she said she would return to the country to appear in court despite the fear that she might be arrested again.
Germany has demanded the release of several of its citizens, some of Turkish origin, as a necessary step toward improving ties with Turkey.
Relations between the NATO partners soured after Germany condemned Turkey's arrests of some 50,000 people, and the suspension or firing of 150,000 others, including teachers, judges and soldiers.

Ties have improved in recent months, especially after Turkey released German-Turkish journalist Deniz Yucel in February.

672,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2018 11:55AM ET</span>",Former top Vatican official says pope should resign over abuse crisis,"By Philip Pullella and Scott Malone
DUBLIN/BOSTON (Reuters) - A former top Vatican official has accused Pope Francis of having known of allegations of sex abuse by a prominent U.S. cardinal for years and called on him to resign, in an unprecedented broadside against the pope by a Church insider.
In a detailed 11-page bombshell statement given to conservative Roman Catholic media outlets during the Pope's visit to Ireland, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano accused a long list of current and past Vatican and U.S. Church officials of covering up the case of Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who resigned last month in disgrace.
In remarkably blunt language, Vigano said alleged cover-ups in the Church were making it look like ""a conspiracy of silence not so dissimilar from the one that prevails in the mafia"".
""Pope Francis has repeatedly asked for total transparency in the Church,"" wrote Vigano, who has criticized the pope before.
""In this extremely dramatic moment for the universal Church, he must acknowledge his mistakes and, in keeping with the proclaimed principle of zero tolerance, Pope Francis must be the first to set a good example for cardinals and bishops who covered up McCarrick’s abuses and resign along with all of them,"" he said.
Vatican officials declined immediate comment on Sunday on the statement, which was published by the National Catholic Register and several other conservative media outlets in the United States and Italy.
Vigano said he had told Francis in June 2013, just after he was elected pope by his fellow cardinals, about the accusations against McCarrick.
Vigano, the papal envoy in Washington from 2011 to 2016, also said he had informed top Vatican officials as early as 2006 that McCarrick was suspected of abusing adult seminarians while he was a bishop in two New Jersey dioceses between 1981 and 2001. He said he never received a response to his 2006 memo.
He also accused McCarrick's successor as archbishop of Washington, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, of having been aware of the abuse allegations. Wuerl has said he did not know of them.
The statement was the latest blow to the credibility of the U.S. Church. Nearly two weeks ago, a grand jury in Pennsylvania released the findings of the largest-ever investigation of sex abuse in the U.S. Catholic Church, finding that 301 priests in the state had sexually abused minors over the past 70 years.
RESIGNATION
McCarrick in July became the first Cardinal in living memory to resign his position in the Church leadership after a review concluded that claims he had sexually abused a 16-year-old boy were credible.
He was one of the highest-ranking church officials accused of sex abuse in a scandal that has rocked the 1.2 billion-member faith since reports of priests abusing children and bishops covering up for them were reported by the Boston Globe in 2002.
Since then patterns of widespread abuse of children have been reported across the United States and Europe, in Chile and Australia, undercutting the Church's moral authority and taking a toll on its membership and coffers
McCarrick, 88, has said he had no recollection of alleged abuse of the minor but has not commented on widespread media reports that he would force adult men studying for the priesthood to sleep with him at a beach house in New Jersey. 
Vigano's statement railed against ""homosexual networks present in the Church"" -- the word ""homosexual"" appears 18 times, while the word ""child"" appears only twice, in both cases in the titles of Church documents Vigano sites.

Francis asked for forgiveness on Sunday during his highly charged visit to Ireland for the ""scandal and betrayal"" felt by victims of sexual exploitation by Catholic clergy. On Saturday he said the corruption and cover-up of abuse amounted to human excrement, according to victims.

Extreme temperatures across the northern hemisphere this summer have fueled concerns that climate change is gathering pace, leading dozens of countries to call for greenhouse gas emissions to be cut at a faster rate than planned.
But Merkel said such calls, most recently from the European Commission's climate chief Miguel Arias Canete, for swifter cuts to harmful carbon dioxide emissions would be counterproductive, adding that setting new goals made little sense when European countries were already struggling to meet their cuts targets.
""I'm not particularly happy about these new proposals,"" she said of Canete's call to increase from 40 to 45 percent the scale of cuts to target by 2030.
""I think we should first stick to the goals we have already set ourselves. I don't think permanently setting ourselves new goals makes any sense.""
Merkel's government has already faced criticism for abandoning emissions targets it had set itself for 2020 after concluding they were unachievable, while sticking to a target it had set itself for a decade later.
This summer's sweltering temperatures across Europe have reignited the climate debate, with record temperatures across the continent causing sea ice to melt in the Arctic, and triggering forest fires across the continent.

""One summer doesn't on its own express it, but the piling up of extreme weather conditions and the rising temperatures shows climate change isn't just in Africa and the Arctic and Antarctic, but here too,"" Merkel said.

Negotiations have been all but deadlocked since U.S. President Donald Trump's summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore in June. 
Pompeo has pressed for tangible steps toward North Korea's abandonment of its nuclear arsenal while Pyongyang is demanding that Washington first make concessions of its own. 
North Korea's Rodong Sinmun newspaper said U.S. special units based in Japan were staging an air drill aimed at ""the infiltration into Pyongyang"", citing a South Korean media outlet. 
""Such acts prove that the U.S. is hatching a criminal plot to unleash a war against the DPRK and commit a crime which deserves merciless divine punishment in case the U.S. fails in the scenario of the DPRK's unjust and brigandish denuclearisation first,"" the paper said. 
""We cannot but take a serious note of the double-dealing attitudes of the U.S. as it is busy staging secret drills involving man-killing special units while having a dialogue with a smile on its face,"" it noted.
A spokesman at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul said he had no information on the drill alleged in the newspaper. The U.S. military spokesman in South Korea was not immediately available to comment. 
    The editorial, which did not mention the Pompeo visit, urged Washington to give up the ""pointless military gamble"" and implement the Singapore agreement, in which the leaders pledged to work towards a complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. 
Since the summit, the two sides have struggled to narrow differences over the North’s nuclear weapons program.
Pyongyang is calling for a declaration of peace as part of security guarantees designed to encourage it to abandon its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, while the Trump administration says a peace deal and other concessions will only come after more progress on denuclearization.
In part to reassure North Korea, Trump canceled or delayed joint military drills with South Korea, but smaller exercises continue. 

Trump partly blamed China for the lack of progress with North Korea and suggested that talks with Pyongyang could be on hold until after Washington resolved its bitter trade dispute with Beijing. China expressed ""serious concern"" about Trump's comments, which it called ""irresponsible"".

Turkey, which has backed some rebel groups in Syria, has been working with Russia, which supports Syrian President Bashar al Assad, and Iran for a political resolution to the crisis.
It has so far carried out two cross-border operations along its border with Syria and set up a dozen military observations posts in the northern Syrian region of Idlib.
The rebel-held Idlib enclave is a refuge for civilians and rebels displaced from other areas of Syria as well as for powerful jihadist forces, but has been hit by a wave of air strikes and shelling this month.
The attacks posed a possible prelude to a full-scale Syrian government offensive, which Turkey has said would be disastrous. 
Speaking in the southeastern province of Mus to commemorate the anniversary of the Battle of Manzikert of 1071, Erdogan vowed to bring peace and safety to Syria and Iraq.
""It is not for nothing that the only places in Syria where security and peace have been established are under Turkey's control. God willing, we will establish the same peace in other parts of Syria too. God willing, we will bring the same peace to Iraq, where terrorist organizations are active,"" he said.
Erdogan also linked regional conflicts and an ongoing currency crisis in Turkey, which he has cast as an ""economic war"", to previous attempts to invade Anatolia, warning that the this would lead to the collapse of surrounding regions.
""Those who seek temporary reasons behind the troubles we have been facing recently are wrong, very wrong. The attacks we face today... are rooted in history,"" he said. 
""Don't forget, Anatolia is a wall and if this wall collapses, there will no longer be a Middle East, Africa, Central Asia, Balkans or Caucasus.""
Turkey's lira has tumbled nearly 40 percent this year as investor concerns over Erdogan's grip on monetary policy and a growing dispute with the United States put pressure on the currency.
Ankara has accused Washington of targeting Turkey over the fate of Andrew Brunson, an American pastor being tried in Turkey on terrorism charges that he denies.

""Some careless people among us think this is about Tayyip Erdogan or the AK Party. No, this is about Turkey,"" Erdogan said.

676,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2018 11:05AM ET</span>",In Ireland Pope begs forgiveness for the 'betrayal' of Church abuse,"By Graham Fahy and Philip Pullella
DUBLIN/KNOCK, Ireland (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Sunday asked for forgiveness for the ""scandal and betrayal"" felt by victims of sexual exploitation by Catholic clergy as he toured Ireland where years of abuse scandals have shattered the Church's former dominant role in society. 
On the first papal visit to Ireland in almost four decades, Francis met privately with eight victims of clerical, religious and institutional abuse on Saturday and said he would seek a greater commitment to eliminating this ""scourge"".
But pressure on the pope over the issue increased on Sunday when a former top Vatican official accused Francis of having known of allegations of sex abuse by a prominent U.S. cardinal for five years before accepting his resignation last month. 
""None of us can fail to be moved by the stories of young people who suffered abuse, were robbed of their innocence and left scarred,"" Francis told a crowd of tens of thousands at the Knock shrine in the west of Ireland on Sunday morning. 
""This open wound challenges us to be firm and decisive in the pursuit of truth and justice. I beg forgiveness for these sins and for the scandal and betrayal felt by so many others in God's family,"" he said, to applause from the crowd. 
Years of sexual abuse scandals have shattered the credibility of the Church which four decades ago dominated Irish society. In the past three years, Irish voters have approved abortion and gay marriage in referendums, defying the Vatican.
The declining influence of the Catholic Church has been demonstrated by crowds far smaller than those that met Pope John Paul II during the last Papal visit in 1979, when more than three-quarters of Ireland's population turned out.
Still, up to 500,000 were expected to flock from all over the country to watch Francis end his visit by saying mass at Dublin's Phoenix Park.
""Given the way things are with so many young peoples' faiths - a lot are not coming to mass because of the abuse - hopefully Pope Francis can draw them back in again,” said Celine Hill, 57, who woke up at 0300 local time to travel from Portstewart in Northern Ireland to see the pope with her husband, Kieran.
""FALSE DAWNS""
Francis, facing sexual abuse crises in several countries, wrote an unprecedented letter to all Catholics last week asking each one of them to help root out ""this culture of death"" and vowing there would be no more cover ups.
At Knock, Francis also condemned the treatment by Catholic religious orders of children who were ""distanced from their mothers, abandoned and left with painful memories,"" an apparent reference to homes for unmarried mothers that operated until the 1990s, where many babies were separated from their mothers. 
During the 20th century tens of thousands of unmarried pregnant women, including rape victims, were sent to give birth at so-called mother-and-baby homes. Many of the children were adopted and during the 1930s-1950s the mortality rate for the ""illegitimate"" children was far higher than that for those born to married parents. 
Some who turned out on a misty morning in the village, where a group of locals in 1879 said they saw an apparition of the Virgin Mary, said Francis should be given a chance to deal with the abuse issues that have rocked the Church for decades. 
""People have to give this man a chance, he's trying his best,"" said Carmel Lane, who travelled from County Longford in the midlands to attend the Mass. 
Vatican officials on Sunday declined immediate comment on the 11-page letter in which Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano said he had told Francis in 2013 that Cardinal Theodore McCarrick had faced extensive accusations of sexual abuse.
One Irish survivor of clerical abuse who met the pope on Saturday, Paul Redmond, said strong language used by Francis at the meeting gave him hope that something might be shifting in the Catholic Church. 
""There's been a lot of false dawns, there's been a lot of empty promises and a lot of talk but maybe, maybe this is the time something, something substantial will actually happen in the Church,"" Redmond told Reuters.
Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney also said Francis' promise of decisive action on abuse was very welcome, but told broadcaster RTE that ""people will clearly be watching now after this visit to see what actions follow.""
With protests planned to coincide with Francis' mass in Dublin and elsewhere, others who took part in sporadic demonstrations on Saturday were not convinced. 
""I don't think he should come and expect us to pay for his visit when there are people today in Ireland who are so damaged and need so much help that they can’t function because of all the abuse,"" said Lisa, 30, who declined to give her surname.

""He shouldn't have come.""

All victims were on the second floor of the two-story brick building with an attic, Langford said. The first floor was empty and boarded up while the attic was a storage area.
Investigators are probing the fire's origin and cause, Langford said. Officials' preliminary observation showed the fire started on second floor, he said. 
The fire was extinguished within 45 minutes, Langford said. Fifteen ambulances were on scene. 
The structure was totaled and the fire's heat was so intense that siding on buildings up to 200 feet away melted.
No smoke detectors were heard and none have been found, Langford said.

President Hage Gottfried Geingob, speaking at a Heroes’ Day commemoration event in Rundu, about 700 kms (440 miles) from the capital Windhoek, said the Second National Land Conference would begin in October.
He said the conference would address the willing-seller, willing-buyer principle, ancestral land claims for restitution, expropriation in public interest with just compensation, urban land reform and resettlement criteria.
Namibia's neighbor and regional economic powerhouse South Africa is also in the process of amending land ownership laws, causing investor jitters locally and abroad, leading to a controversial tweet by United States President Donald Trump this week criticizing the move by South Africa.
Namibia wants to transfer 43 percent, or 15 million hectares of its arable agricultural land, to previously disadvantaged blacks by 2020. By the end of 2015, 27 percent was redistributed, according to the Namibia Agriculture Union. 
Critics say the current land resettlement program has failed to adequately address the land question in Namibia whose ownership is currently skewed in favor of a tiny white minority. 
""Government is opening up these difficult policy conversations because no one should be under the illusion that our fight for freedom is complete,"" Geingob said. 
Geingob has previously said the government should evoke part of the Constitution allowing for land expropriation with fair compensation since the redistribution process has been slow.
In April Namibia scrapped a clause in its economic empowerment framework that would have forced white businesses to sell a 25 percent stake to previously disadvantaged blacks, saying the state did not have enough resources to invest in empowerment transactions.

The Iranian economy is dogged by high unemployment and the rial has lost half its value since April. The United States reimposed some sanctions in early August and a second set targeting Iran's oil industry is due to take effect in November.
The head of the elite Revolutionary Guards said Iran faced ""unique"" challenges and the foreign minister accused the United States of waging ""psychological war"" on his country.
The Iranian parliament backed the removal from office of Masoud Karbasian, minister of finance and economic affairs, by 137 votes to 121 against, state media said.
The sacking was the latest in a continuing shakeup of top economic personnel. In early August Iranian lawmakers voted out the minister of labor and last month President Hassan Rouhani replaced the head of the central bank.
The U.S. sanctions, reimposed after President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of a 2015 international deal aimed at curbing Tehran's nuclear program, have exacerbated an already difficult economic situation in Iran.
""(America's) focus is on a psychological war against Iran and its business partners,"" Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Sunday, according to the Tasnim news agency.
""From the time that Trump announced the withdrawal from the nuclear deal, America has not been able to reach its goals,"" Zarif added, according to the Iranian Students' News Agency (ISNA).
""COMPLICATED AND SENSITIVE"" SITUATION
Other parties to the 2015 accord - China, Russia, Germany, Britain and France - are trying to salvage the deal, which lifted some economic sanctions against Iran in return for curbs on Tehran's nuclear program. But their companies now face the risk of U.S. penalties if they do business with Iran. 
Washington also wants Tehran to end its support for militant groups in Syria and Iraq.
Protests linked to the tough economic situation in Iran began last December, spreading to more than 80 cities and towns and resulting in 25 deaths.
Sporadic protests, led by truck drivers, farmers and merchants in Tehran’s bazaar, have continued regularly since then and have occasionally resulted in violent confrontations with security forces.
The head of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards, Major General Ali Jafari said on Sunday Iran was facing a ""unique, complicated and sensitive"" situation, with both external and internal threats to its security, Tasnim reported.
The U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal has undermined Rouhani, a relative pragmatist, and emboldened his hardline opponents who always opposed any compromises with Washington.
Zarif appeared to offer guarded criticism of Rouhani's opponents.

""There are some in the country who, instead of laying the groundwork for using the opportunities presented by the nuclear deal, chose a political fight,"" Zarif said, according to ISNA. ""And this political fight led to despair and disappointment.""

Ten other members of the militant group were also killed in a joint ground and air operation by Afghan and foreign forces, the National Directorate of Security in Kabul said in a statement.
A large amount of heavy and light weapons and ammunition were destroyed during raids on two Islamic State hideouts.
The jihadist group's Amaq's news agency carried no comment on the issue, and there was no immediate reaction from the NATO-led Resolute Support mission that trains and advises Afghan forces.
The provincial governor of Nangarhar said Erhabi was the fourth Islamic State leader in Afghanistan to be killed since July 2017.
The group has developed a stronghold in Nangarhar, on Afghanistan's porous eastern border with Pakistan, and become one of the country’s most dangerous militant groups. 
The local affiliate of Islamic State, sometimes known as Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K) after an old name for the region that includes Afghanistan, has been active since 2015, fighting the Taliban as well as Afghan and U.S. forces.
Former ISIS-K leader Abu Sayed was killed in a strike in the eastern province of Nangarhar and Sayed's predecessors were killed joint U.S. and Afghan operations. 
The exact number of Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan is difficult to calculate because they frequently switch allegiances, but the U.S. military estimates that there are about 2,000.
More than 150 Islamic State fighters surrendered to Afghan security forces this month in the northwestern province of Jawzjan, where the group is fighting for control of smuggling routes into neighboring Turkmenistan.

HARARE (Reuters) - Emmerson Mnangagwa urged Zimbabwe to unite behind his presidency on Sunday, as he took the oath of office following a divisive election that U.S. observers said had called the country's democratic credentials into question.
The Constitutional Court confirmed Mnangagwa as president on Friday, dismissing a challenge by the man he beat in the July 30 ballot, Nelson Chamisa.
Thousands of Zimbabweans, some bussed in, and foreign leaders including South Africa's Cyril Ramaphosa and Paul Kagame of Rwanda gathered at Harare's national stadium for Sunday's swearing-in.
""I exhort us to commit ourselves collectively to develop our motherland... what unites us is greater than what could ever divide us,"" Mnangagwa told election participants in his inauguration speech.
He also reaffirmed pre-election pledges to revive Zimbabwe's crippled economy and settle outstanding debts with foreign lenders, and reiterated he would call an independent inquiry into a ""regrettable and unacceptable"" army crackdown following the vote in which six people died.
""Now is the time for us all to unite as a nation and grow our economy,"" Mnangagwa said. 
He took the oath before Chief Justice Luke Malaba who, together with eight other judges, had ruled on Friday against opposition leader Chamisa's petition.
In the election, Mnangagwa just reached the threshold of 50 percent of votes that he needed to avoid a runoff.
NO LONGER A PARIAH?
The ballot was touted as a crucial step toward shedding the pariah reputation Zimbabwe gained under Mnangagwa's predecessor Robert Mugabe, and securing international donor funding.
But hours before Mnangagwa's inauguration, the International Republican Institute and National Democratic Institute said the country lacked a ""tolerant democratic culture"" in which political parties were treated equally and citizens allowed to vote freely.
The election was marred by procedural lapses and followed by the crackdown against opposition supporters, which recalled the heavy-handed security tactics that marked Mugabe's 37-year rule.
Those events tarnished promises that Mnangagwa made during campaigning to break with the corruption and mismanagement that become endemic under Mugabe, who was removed in a coup in November.
Mugabe, who has accused Mnangagwa - his former head of intelligence and defense minister - of betrayal, did not attend Sunday's ceremony, though the 94-year-old former leader's daughter Bona did. In keeping with an earlier promise, Chamisa also stayed away.
Citing the Constitutional Court ruling, the U.S. observers also urged all parties ""to rely on peaceful expression and to avoid acts or threats of retribution against political rivals."" 
Washington has maintained travel and financial sanctions on senior ruling party officials, including Mnangagwa, as well as some state-owned firms. Washington's support is key if Zimbabwe is to get any funding from the International Monetary Fund. 

The European Union, meanwhile, has progressively removed sanctions and they only remain in place on Mugabe and his wife Grace.

The accusation, leveled by Russia's embassy in London, came after the RAF intercepted a Russian maritime patrol aircraft over the Black Sea on Friday and scrambled to intercept two suspected Russian fighter aircraft on Wednesday.
"".... What kind of threat to Britain or even its allies does a Russian patrol aircraft hypothetically pose while conducting flights near Russia's own coastline, more than 2,000 km (1242.74 miles) from the British Isles,"" the Russian embassy said in a statement released on Saturday.
""Instead of strengthening anyone's security, the British authorities are using such a military presence (in the Black Sea area) for provocative actions. Not just by making verbal statements, regrettable as they are, but also in real military terms, which is simply dangerous.""
The British defense and foreign ministries declined to comment on Sunday.
Three countries bordering the Black Sea - Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey - are NATO allies of Britain.
Britain's Minister of State for the Armed Forces, Mark Lancaster, spoke about ""an ever more assertive Russia"" in a speech in London in July. He said the RAF had been forced to intercept Russian military aircraft more than 80 times over the last decade.
Relations between London and Moscow are languishing at a post-Cold War low after the poisoning by nerve agent of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in March in the English city of Salisbury.
London holds Moscow responsible for the attack, something Russia denies. 
Britain's RAF maintains a presence in the Baltic countries and in Romania to deter potential Russian military action after Moscow's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea. Moscow says its activity in the Black Sea region is routine and compliant with international law.

HONOLULU (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Lane, greatly diminished from the major hurricane it once was, drifted away from the Hawaiian coast on Saturday, but lingering showers threatened to trigger more flooding and landslides.
The National Weather Service (NWS) lifted all remaining tropical storm warnings and watch advisories for Hawaii as trade winds finally began to nudge Lane off to the west.
But a flash flood watch remained in effect for Oahu, home to the state capital Honolulu and 70 percent of Hawaii's 1.4 million residents, through Sunday morning, emergency management officials said. 
Civil defense officials on the Big Island said more rain and flooding were also possible there, and a high-surf advisory was posted through the day for south- and east-facing shores of all the islands. 
Lane's maximum sustained winds dropped to 50 miles (80 km) per hour, but residual moisture would produce excessive rainfall that could lead to ""additional flash flooding and landslides,"" a weather service bulletin said.
Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas one year ago Saturday, then stalled over the Gulf Coast as it drenched the region in rain for several days, causing devastating floods. 
BIG ISLAND BEARS BRUNT OF RAIN
Ahead of Lane, Hawaii residents had spent days stocking up on food, water, gasoline and batteries and boarding up their windows.
The island chain was spared the calamity of a direct hit from a major hurricane as the storm steadily weakened on Friday.
However, by then torrential showers had drenched the windward side of Hawaii's Big Island for more than two days, unleashing severe flooding and mudslides that forced multiple road closures and damaged or destroyed a number of homes and other structures, authorities said.
At least two neighborhoods around Hilo, the largest city on the Big Island, were evacuated on Friday, and emergency teams have rescued more than 50 people trapped by high water since Thursday, Hawaii County Civil Defense spokeswoman Kelly Wooten told Reuters by phone.
""I've never seen this, so much devastation of the river flowing down off of Komohana,"" said one long-time Hilo resident, Tracy Pacheco. ""I just came from Pahale Park, and there's no park.""
Rains finally abated on the Big Island on Saturday, she said. 
Hilo received more than 31 inches (79 cm) of rain from Wednesday through Friday, its largest three-day total since records began in 1949. Some areas received more than 45 inches, the weather service said.
Forecasts predicted that Lane, which peaked as a Category 5 hurricane with top sustained winds of 160 mph (260 kph) earlier in the week while far from Hawaii, would diminish into a tropical depression by early on Sunday.
By Saturday morning the water had receded enough that many residents of Hilo were mopping up several inches of mud.
Jillane Bosscher, a 45-year-old chef, and her family spent Thursday night and Friday in a local shelter. By Saturday the water had receded enough that they were able to return home and start cleaning.
In another sign of improving conditions, most harbors around the state were reopened or placed on ""hurricane preparedness"" status allowing shippers to resume operations with caution, a according to the state Transportation Department.

On the islands of Maui, Molokai and Lanai, evacuees have returned home from emergency shelters, and those facilities were being closed, local officials reported.

686,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2018 06:57AM ET</span>",Japanese PM Abe seen headed for extended term despite flat ratings,"By Linda Sieg
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced on Sunday his candidacy for a ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leadership election that he is expected to win despite flat ratings and low expectations for his economic policies.
The expected victory over ex-defense minister Shigeru Ishiba in the Sept. 20 party poll would put him on track to become Japan's longest-serving premier. The winner becomes prime minister due to the LDP-led coalition's grip on parliament.
""It is my responsibility to respond to the mandate of the people,"" Abe told reporters during a trip to southwestern Japan. ""I am resolved to steer Japan for another three years as LDP president and prime minister.""
Analysts say Abe looks set hold on to the top job because his nearly six years in power have enabled him to woo LDP backers with cabinet posts and other favors and to shut out rivals, while a weak opposition makes his lukewarm popularity among the electorate less relevant.
Abe began a second stint as prime minister in 2012 promising to reboot the deflation-plagued economy with his ""Abenomics"" policies and to bolster defense. 
He has boosted defense spending and loosened constitutional limits on the military but, on the economic side, the Bank of Japan has failed to reach its 2 percent inflation target despite an ultra-loose policy.
What Abe will pursue if he wins the vote and extends his tenure as prime minister is far from clear.
""What is the economic agenda? The answer is stability - don't rock the boat,"" said Jesper Koll, head of equities fund WisdomTree Japan. 
On the security front, Abe wants to revise the post-war constitution's pacifist Article 9 to clarify the ambiguous status of Japan's military. The article, if taken literally, bans maintenance of armed forces but it has been interpreted to allow a military for self-defense.
CONSTITUTION CHANGE RISKY
Whether he will make the attempt is in doubt, since the proposal is controversial and the process is politically risky. Amendments need approval by two-thirds of both houses of parliament and a majority in a referendum.
""The only concrete item on his agenda I can see is constitutional revision, and that is unlikely to fly,"" said Columbia University emeritus professor Gerry Curtis.
Abe is not wildly popular, although his ratings have recovered from lows of about 30 percent earlier this year amid accusations of cronyism scandals. He has denied wrongdoing. 
An Asahi News Network (ANN) survey published on Monday put his support at 38.8 percent, while a Kyodo news agency poll on Sunday showed support at 44.2 percent.
Ishiba, who stresses the need to revive public trust in politics and redress economic imbalances, outranked Abe among voters asked who they'd prefer to see as premier in the ANN poll, with 42 percent to Abe's 34 percent.
Among LDP backers, though, Abe was ahead with 58 percent to Ishiba's 31 percent. 
Media surveys suggest Abe has the support of at least 70 percent of the 405 votes in the leadership election from LDP parliamentarians. Another 405 votes will be apportioned based on the votes of rank-and-file party members.
""Abe gets people as excited as cold pizza but will win because he co-opts, sidelines and intimidates potential LDP rivals, and doesn't have to worry about tepid public support because the opposition has imploded,"" said Jeffrey Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University Japan campus.
The opposition Democratic Party of Japan, haunted by its rocky 2009-2012 rule, broke up last year. 
Its successors, the left-of-centre Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ) and the centrist Democratic Party for the People (DPP), are struggling. 
CDPJ support was at 5.6 percent in a survey by NHK public TV this month and that for the DPP at 0.4 percent. LDP support was 35.6 percent, with 43.2 percent backing no particular party.

In another potential positive for the LDP, a government survey released on Friday showed about 75 percent of Japanese were satisfied or mostly satisfied with their daily lives.

Galileo, a 10 billion euro ($11.44 billion) satellite program being developed by the EU as a rival to the U.S. Global Positioning System, has emerged as a flashpoint between Britain and the EU, which is already beginning to treat Britain as an outsider.
Britain's finance minister Philip Hammond has approved 100 million pounds to explore a post-Brexit satellite system and an official announcement will be made this week, the Sunday Telegraph reported.
A spokeswoman for Britain's Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy declined to comment.
The European Commission has started to exclude Britain and its companies from sensitive future work on Galileo ahead of the country's exit from the EU in seven months time.
Galileo was commissioned in 2003 and is due for completion by 2020. One expert has predicted that it could cost Britain about 3 billion pounds to build a rival system.
The EU has said Britain will be able to continue to use Galileo's open signal, but that Britain's military could be denied access to the encrypted version when the satellite becomes operational.
Britain has said it plans to press ahead with the development of its own satellite navigation system if the EU continues to insist that it will be barred from the secure elements of the project and will demand a repayment of up to 1 billion pounds for the work it has carried out on the project.

Egypt's state news agency MENA said on Saturday that security forces foiled an attack on a checkpoint west of the city of al-Arish, and killed four militants while other fled.
MENA made no reference to any casualties among security forces in the attack, but the privately owned al-Masri al-Youm newspaper reported that four policemen had died.
Egyptian troops, backed by police, have since February been conducting a major operation targeting Islamist militants behind a wave of attacks against security forces and civilians. Hundreds of suspected militants have been killed or captured in the operation. 
Amaq said Islamic State militants targeted the Kilometre 17 checkpoint west of al-Arish, without giving any evidence or details on how many were involved.
MENA, citing an unnamed source, said Egyptian police confronted the militants who tried to storm the checkpoint, killing four of them while the rest fled.
The Egyptian army military campaign began after President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi ordered the army and security forces to crush militants after gunmen killed hundreds of worshippers at a mosque in Sinai last November.
Egypt says fighting Islamist militants is a priority to restore security to the country of some 96 million people after years of turmoil that followed Arab Spring protests in 2011.
Sisi's critics say his presidency has brought a harsh crackdown on dissent.

Pompeo's statement came on the one year anniversary of the conflict in western Myanmar’s Rakhine state that drove more than 700,000 Rohingya from their homes into neighboring Bangladesh.
""A year ago, following deadly militant attacks, security forces responded by launching abhorrent ethnic cleansing of ethnic #Rohingya in Burma,"" Pompeo said on Twitter, using an alternative name for Myanmar.
""The U.S. will continue to hold those responsible accountable. The military must respect human rights for #Burma’s democracy to succeed.""
The military ruled Myanmar for nearly 50 years after seizing power in a 1962 coup and retains considerable powers under a 2008 constitution. 
Myanmar government spokesmen Zaw Htay was unavailable for comment on Sunday.
The government, led by Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, has denied refugees' allegations of atrocities, saying security forces lawfully suppressed Muslim militants in Rakhine.
Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh held demonstrations and prayers on Saturday to mark the anniversary of the outbreak of the conflict.
Thousands of refugees marched prayed and chanted slogans in events across the sprawling camps in southern Bangladesh. Many wore black ribbons to commemorate what they said was the start of the “Rohingya genocide”.
Across the border in Myanmar, the government said security patrols had been increased in the conflict area ahead of the anniversary for fear of further violence. Members of the mostly Buddhist Rakhine ethnic group and Hindus from Rakhine state said they would hold events to remember those killed by Rohingya militants in attacks that triggered the crisis.
Earlier this month, the United States imposed sanctions on four Myanmar military and police commanders and two army units, accusing them of ""ethnic cleansing"" against Rohingya Muslims and widespread human rights abuses across the Southeast Asian nation.

International pressure on Myanmar has been growing as U.N.-mandated investigators are set to publish a report on the crisis on Monday and the United Nations Security Council will hold a briefing on Myanmar on Tuesday.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop resigned from new Prime Minister Scott Morrison's Cabinet on Sunday, two days after a bruising leadership battle that toppled former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull and led to a major ministerial shake-up.
Bishop announced she would move to the backbench and had not yet decided whether to contest the next election, which is due by May 2019. That decision could have serious implications for Morrison's government, which has a parliamentary majority of only one seat.
She had been foreign minister since 2013 and was replaced by former defense minister Marise Payne in the new Cabinet line-up announced by Morrison after Bishop resigned. 
Morrison replaced Turnbull in a party-room vote after a week of political chaos in Canberra that marked the emergence of Australia's sixth prime minister in less than 10 years.
He took over as leader of the Liberal Party, the senior partner in a Liberal-National coalition that has consistently trailed the opposition Labor party in opinion polls in recent months.
Bishop contested Friday's leadership vote but was eliminated in the first round, with Morrison then emerging as a surprise compromise winner over Peter Dutton, Turnbull's conservative challenger who brought the leadership crisis to a head earlier in the week.
""I will remain on the backbench as a strong voice for Western Australia,"" Bishop said in a statement soon after she arrived back in her home state.
BY-ELECTION CONCERN
The possibility that Bishop could leave parliament before the next election will be a major concern for Morrison, Turnbull's former treasurer, because it opens the possibility of another by-election being held for her seat.
His party will already have to contest a by-election for Turnbull's harbourside electorate in Sydney, traditionally a safe Liberal seat. Turnbull's resignation from parliament was expected in the coming week.
Morrison's new Cabinet includes former Turnbull loyalist Christopher Pyne as the new defense minister.
Dutton, whose first challenge on Tuesday sparked the crisis that ultimately toppled Turnbull, returns as home affairs minister in an apparent attempt by Morrison to rebuild unity in his badly bruised party.
However, his portfolio will no longer include immigration, a politically sensitive issue in Australia because of the hardline approach taken by successive governments against asylum seekers who attempt to arrive illegally.
That policy includes the detention of asylum-seekers on remote Pacific islands such as Nauru, a policy that has had bipartisan support but which has been harshly criticized by the United Nations and human rights groups.
Morrison had already announced his Liberal deputy Josh Frydenberg, the former energy minister, would take over as treasurer. He said Angus Taylor, a Dutton supporter, would be the new energy minister.

Senator Mathias Cormann, one of several senior ministers who had pledged their loyalty to Turnbull before turning on him, will return as finance minister in Morrison's new Cabinet.

Iranian forces have backed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the country's civil war.
""We hope to have a productive role in the reconstruction of Syria,"" Hatami said on arrival in Syria, according to Fars News.
U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton said last week that Iran should remove its forces from Syria. 
Senior Iranian officials have said their military presence in Syria is at the invitation of the Assad government and they have no immediate plans to withdraw.
More than 1,000 Iranians, including senior members of the elite Revolutionary Guards, have been killed in Syria since 2012.
The Guards initially kept quiet about their role in the Syria conflict. But in recent years, as casualties have mounted, they have been more outspoken about their engagement, framing it as an existential struggle against the Sunni Muslim fighters of Islamic State who see Shi'ites - the majority of Iran's population - as apostates.

HANOI (Reuters) - On the shores of a still and peaceful lake on the edge of downtown Hanoi, the inscription on a faded monument stands as a reminder of a violent event 51 years ago.
""On Oct 26, 1967, at Truc Bach Lake, the military and people of Hanoi arrested Major John Sidney McCain, a pilot of the American Navy's air force,"" it says on the sculpture, which depicts an airman with his hands above his head in front of a broken plane wing.
McCain, a U.S. senator who ran unsuccessfully for president as a self-styled maverick Republican in 2008 and became a prominent critic of President Donald Trump, died on Saturday, his office said. He was 81.
The naval aviator was flying one of 10 planes that were shot down by the North Vietnamese military on the same day, according to the inscription on the statue, which McCain himself visited on a return to Vietnam in 2009.
""I felt compelled to come out here and bring some flowers,"" said Robert Gibb, an American in Hanoi who placed a bouquet of yellow chrysanthemums at the foot of the monument after hearing the news of McCain's death on Sunday morning.
Gibb was one of several U.S. citizens living in the Vietnamese capital to visit the monument with tributes. Most brought flowers. One man offered a folded U.S. flag.
""He was the last guy I ever voted for president,"" said Gibb. ""The moment he dropped in here changed his life forever.""
'HANOI HILTON'
McCain was dragged out of Truc Bach lake and spent the next five-and-a-half years as a high-profile prisoner of war in Hoa Lo prison - the infamous ""Hanoi Hilton' - where he said he and others were tortured. 
Vietnam says the American prisoners were treated well.
A statue marking the spot by the lake was erected in 1967, and renovated in the 1980s and 1990s.
The monument is easy to miss - the tree-lined street it stands on is now a popular tourist destination, dotted with cafes, ice cream parlors and vendors selling cotton candy from the back of bicycles.
The U.S. Embassy in Hanoi said on Sunday it planned to launch a fellowship to support a ""young Vietnamese leader committed to public service"" to travel to the United States on a study tour annually.
The program will be named the ""McCain/Kerry Fellowship"" in honor of McCain and John Kerry, another Vietnam War veteran who has promoted U.S.-Vietnam issues during his political career, the embassy said in a statement.
Le Ma Luong, the former director of the Vietnam Military History Museum in Hanoi who met McCain soon after 2010, told Reuters he remembered the late senator as an articulate and professional man who contributed greatly to building relations with Vietnam.
Luong said he felt sorry that in return Vietnam had been unable to locate the ring McCain was wearing on the day he was dragged out of the lake.
""That was the ring his wife gave him and it went missing after he was shot down and rescued. We have tried our best to find it but in vain,"" said Luong. ""Anyone who lost a ring from their beloved would be devastated by it, not just him"".

""His contribution to the Vietnam-U.S. relationship will be remembered.""

However, Ghani rejected the resignations and instead instructed them to find ways to prevent fresh attacks by militant groups. 
Heavy fighting between Taliban insurgents, as well as other militant groups, and security forces has raged across Afghanistan this year. There have also been suicide attacks in Kabul and other major cities.

Authorities have been bracing for more attacks with parliamentary elections due on Oct. 20. The scale of the violence has shocked government officials, who are facing bitter criticism over their handling of the war.

CATANIA, Italy (Reuters) - Italy on Saturday began disembarking 150 migrants from a rescue ship that had been docked for five days in a Sicilian port, ending the migrants' ordeal and a bitter stand-off between Rome's anti-establishment government and its European Union partners.
The migrants, mainly from Eritrea, had been stranded in the port of Catania since Monday because the government refused to let them off the boat until other EU states agreed to take some of them in.
Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said Albania had offered to accept 20 of the migrants and Ireland 20-25, while the rest would be housed by Italy's Catholic Church ""at zero cost"" to the Italian taxpayer.
""The church has opened its heart and opened its wallet,"" Salvini, from the right-wing League party, told supporters at a rally in Pinzolo in northern Italy.
Salvini, who has led a popular crackdown against immigration since the government took office in June, also announced that he had been placed under investigation by a Sicilian prosecutor for abuse of office, kidnapping and illegal arrest.
""Being investigated for defending the rights of Italians is a disgrace,"" he said.
Earlier on Saturday, the United Nations called for reason from all sides after a meeting of envoys from 10 EU states in Brussels a day earlier failed to break the deadlock.
""Frightened people who may be in need of international protection should not be caught in the maelstrom of politics,"" the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said in a statement.
The agency appealed to EU member states to ""urgently"" offer relocation places to the rescued people, in line with an agreement at an EU summit in June, and in the meantime, urged Italy to allow ""the immediate disembarkation of those on board.""
Rome had refused to back down, despite criticism from rights groups and the opposition, with Salvini saying he considered the attacks he received to be a ""badge of honor.""
The only help from within the bloc came late on Saturday from Ireland, whose offer to take in 20-25 migrants followed a pledge from non-EU member Albania to take in 20.
Italy's Foreign Ministry called Albania's offer ""a signal of great solidarity and friendship that Italy greatly appreciates.""
PM BUDGET THREAT
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte attacked the EU for its lack of support and said Italy may refuse to back the bloc's multiyear budget currently under discussion.
He said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that Friday's meeting in Brussels had been ""a defeat for Europe"", and ""a clear violation of the spirit of solidarity"" that should be a founding principle of the Union.
Before the breakthrough late on Saturday, thirteen migrants - seven women and six men - were ordered off the boat by doctors after a check-up carried out at around midday.
They finally left the boat one-by-one some six hours later, stepping down a flight of steps to touch dry land for the first time since leaving Libya at least 10 days ago. The 13 were taken by ambulance to Catania's Garibaldi hospital.
Italian media reported that among them there were three cases of suspected tuberculosis and two of suspected pneumonia. Medical officials on the spot did not confirm this.
The Interior Ministry said the remaining migrants will disembark during the night and be taken to a reception center in the Sicilian city of Messina, before being distributed to the Church dioceses as well as Ireland and Albania.
More than 650,000 people have reached Italian shores since 2014, and even though the numbers have fallen steeply in the last year, Rome says it will not let any more rescue ships dock unless the migrants are shared out around the EU.
""The next ship can turn around and go back where it came from because our limit has been reached,"" Salvini said.
Earlier this week, Italy let 27 unaccompanied minors leave the vessel. Prior to that, another 13 people needing urgent hospital attention were evacuated.
During their five days docked at Catania, the mostly young men on board sheltered from the sun under a large green tarpaulin that covered around half the deck, with clothes hanging attached to it to dry. Some occasionally waved to reporters gathered on the quayside.
Around 200 protesters gathered at the port on Saturday, some waving left-wing flags, calling for the migrants to be allowed off. They later skirmished with police.
Meanwhile in Rome, prosecutor Luigi Patronaggio questioned several Interior Ministry officials as part of his criminal investigation over the migrants being held against their will. 
At that time, the investigation was said to be against ""unknown persons"", but Salvini said he was responsible for his ministry's actions, challenging the prosecutor to arrest him. 
The 5-Star Movement, the League's coalition partner, has so far backed Salvini's hard line, and its Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli, who is responsible for the country's ports, on Saturday renewed the government's attacks on the EU.

""Nobody can give lessons to Italy on its humanitarian efforts"", he said. ""The government is only asking the EU give some sense to its own existence.""

""The growth estimate we are building our budget on is 1.7 percent,"" Edouard Philippe told weekend newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche in an interview. 
President Emmanuel Macron's government had been expecting growth next year of 1.9 percent, down marginally from an estimated 2.0 percent this year.
However, both forecasts have increasingly looked optimistic after a series of weak economic data prompted institutions like the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund to predict slower growth than the government.
Asked if government's target for a public sector budget deficit of 2.3 percent of output was under threat, Philippe acknowledged the weaker outlook would have an impact on the public finances.
""But that does not prevent us from sticking to our commitments on reducing taxes while reining in public spending and debt,"" he added.

Philippe said that the government, which is under pressure from Brussels and the IMF to detail its savings plans, wanted to reduce spending in particular on ineffective policies like housing or subsidized jobs.

During Franco's 1939-1975 rule - which remains a highly sensitive topic more than four decades after his death - tens of thousands of his enemies were killed and imprisoned in a campaign to wipe out dissent, and as many as 500,000 combatants and civilians died in the preceding civil war, which split the nation in two. 
According to several national newspapers, seven grandchildren of Franco issued a statement expressing their ""firm and unanimous"" opposition to the exhumation.
The statement, reported in El Pais, El Mundo and La Vanguardia among others, was a response to a decree passed on Friday to reduce the risk that legal claims could impede the plan, a longstanding ambition of the ruling Socialists.
The Valley of the Fallen site, where Franco and tens of thousands of victims of Spain's 1936-39 civil war lie, has been criticised as Europe's only remaining monument to a fascist leader.
It was not immediately clear what legal avenues are open to Franco's descendants in the face of a decree that needs to be approved by parliament, but is unlikely to be voted down.
The statement said the family hoped the Benedictine order in charge of the site, which is marked by a 152-metre (500 ft) high cross, would prevent the state's ""vengefulness"", the papers said.
The decree gives the family 15 days from the end of August to decide where they want the remains to be taken, or cede that decision to the government.

""If an exhumation were to be performed against our will, we would demand that (the remains) are delivered to us so that we can proceed with a Christian burial,"" the family's statement said.

Peru implemented the passport requirement on Saturday due to a four-fold increase in migrants fleeing economic collapse in Venezuela in the past eight months, in a move authorities said would help them register entrants. Many Venezuelans struggle to obtain passports and arrive only with national identity cards.
""There are hundreds that have entered with a petition for refugee status, a procedure that is allowing people without passports to enter,"" said Abel Chiroque, the director of the public defender's office in the border town of Tumbes. ""We must act humanely with this vulnerable population.""
Other migrants - namely children, pregnant women, the ill and the elderly - had been allowed entry for humanitarian reasons, he added.
Both Ecuador and Peru tightened border restrictions for Venezuelan migrants earlier this month in response to the growing influx. This week, the United Nations migration agency said the exodus was building toward a ""crisis moment"" and called on Peru and Ecuador to ease the restrictions.
Chiroque said he had received reports of possible human trafficking, and was concerned about cases of children and adolescents traveling alone or accompanied by adults who were not direct family members. 
He pointed to the case of seven children who were traveling without parents, and were currently being held in a state-run shelter in Tumbes until authorities can ""resolve their situation.""
The growing numbers fleeing economic meltdown and political turmoil in Venezuela, where people scrounge for food and other necessities of daily life, threaten to overwhelm neighboring countries. Officials from Colombia, Ecuador and Peru will meet in Bogota next week to seek a way forward.

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghanistan's national security adviser, one of the most influential aides to President Ashraf Ghani, resigned on Saturday, a move one official said could be followed by his own bid for the top job in next year's scheduled election.
Hanif Atmar's resignation was accepted by Ghani, presidential spokesman Haroon Chakhansuri told Reuters.
The spokesman gave no official reason for the abrupt departure, but a copy of Atmar's resignation letter obtained by Reuters said he had developed ""serious differences over policies and principles with government leadership"".
A senior government official close to Atmar, who spoke on condition that his name was not used, said the former security adviser was considering running against Ghani in the 2019 vote.
""He has resigned because he is preparing to run for presidential election next year,"" said the official.
Atmar, 49, has been considered the second-most powerful official in Afghanistan since he became national security adviser after Ghani was sworn in as president in late 2014.
He was also minister of interior under former President Hamid Karzai before being sacked in 2010 after Taliban insurgents' attacked a ""peace jirga"" that was an early attempt at ending the now-17-year-old war with the Taliban.
The exact details of the rift with Ghani were not immediately clear, but in the past week the Afghan government declined to attend peace talks hosted by Russia that representatives of the Taliban are expected to attend.
Atmar, who began his security career with the Soviet Union-backed government in the late 1980s, is still seen as close to Russia.

Ghani on Saturday appointed 35-year-old Hamdullah Mohib, Afghan ambassador to United States, to replace Atmar as national security adviser, the presidential spokesman said.

(Reuters) - Police in North Carolina arrested seven people on Saturday during scuffles at a university campus where demonstrators earlier this week had toppled a statue of a Confederate soldier, a school official said.
Most of those taken into custody face assault charges, Carly Miller, a spokeswoman for the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill, said in an email.
Saturday's protest followed a larger one on Monday when about 300 demonstrators surrounded the Silent Sam memorial, erected in 1913 to honor soldiers of the pro-slavery Confederacy killed during the U.S. Civil War, and used ropes to pull it down.
This was the latest incident in a campaign against Civil War symbols by opponents who say they glorify the South's legacy of slavery and racism. Supporters view the memorials as emblems of American history.
Three people suspected of pulling down the Silent Sam statue face misdemeanor charges of riot and defacing a public monument, a university police spokesman said on Friday.
Video from Saturday that was shared on social media showed competing rallies, with some waving signs with slogans such as ""Destroy White Supremacy,"" and others holding Confederate flags. At one point, a man in a wide-brimmed hat punched another man in the face and was led away by police.
North Carolina law requires that the memorial be placed back on the campus within 90 days, UNC board member Thom Goolsby said in a video statement on Thursday. He also said the statue had been ""torn down by a violent mob.""
UNC Chancellor Carol Folt said during a conference call with reporters on Saturday that officials were assessing what the law required in terms of the reinstallation of the statue.
""I've said from the start that I think, in the interest of public safety, I would find a better location - a safe, secure location - for the monument,"" Folt said, adding that the ideal place would be one where people could discuss the statue. ""If I could do that, that is what I still believe is necessary.""
More than 100 people attended Saturday's protest, she said.

""We all have to recognize that the Confederate monument is a flashpoint for demonstrations and interruptions on campus and we believe it will continue to be a lightning rod,"" Folt said.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia's prime minister said on Saturday an election due for 2020 would be free and should not be delayed by his sweeping reforms to the African nation's politics, economy and diplomacy.
Abiy Ahmed, who took office in April, has pledged to open up the state-dominated economy and has taken steps to end decades of hostility with neighboring Eritrea -- moves that could reshape the country and the broader Horn of Africa region.
He said on Saturday at his first news conference that the World Bank would provide $1 billion in budget support in the next few months, explaining that ""this is due to the reforms taking place in the country.""
Since winning office, Abiy has loosened the grip of a state that had ruled with an iron fist. He has ordered the release of political prisoners and decried abuses by security forces as state terrorism.
""My dream and ambition is for democratic elections to be held,"" the 42-year-old prime minister said.
""Otherwise, what legitimacy can any official have without the mandate earned through elections?""
Abiy said elections, due in 2020, should not be delayed until the reforms he has announced are completed.
He said the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) coalition's focus next year would be on ""preparations for free elections to be held."" 
Abiy has promised to give more room to opponents in a nation of 100 million where no opposition lawmakers sit in parliament.
He has lifted a state of emergency put in place after his predecessor resigned in February following three years of protests in which hundreds were killed by security forces.
The World Bank and other donors suspended budgetary help following a vote in 2005 that was disputed by the opposition and accompanied by violence that killed 200 people. 
The ruling coalition, in power since ousting dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991, has long been accused by the opposition of crushing dissent, a charge it had denied, though Abiy has spoken frankly since taking office about past abuses.
Some political dissidents have voiced scepticism about change as long as Abiy's EPRDF remains in power. 
Protests that led to the resignation of his predecessor were partly driven by Ethiopia's disillusioned youth, suffering high levels of unemployment. Although it has been one of Africa's fastest-growing economies, Ethiopia's export sector - mainly garment manufacturing and farming - has struggled, meaning the economy is not generating enough dollars to pay for imports.
The dollar shortages have been exacerbated by the government's massive investment in infrastructure over the last decade.
The government last month called on Ethiopians to bring their hard currency into banks to ease the shortage, a move which closed the once yawning gap between the official and black market exchange rates for the birr currency. [L8N1UG5JH]
On Saturday, Abiy said ""economic sabotage"" had taken place and adding that ""large groups"" were still hoarding foreign exchange, without giving details.

Though the government has pledged to partially privatize several key state-owned companies, including the telecoms monopoly, the form liberalization will take and the speed with which it will be carried out have not been announced.

COX'S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Refugees in Bangladesh held demonstrations and prayers on Saturday to mark the passing of a year since the outbreak of a conflict in western Myanmar's Rakhine state that drove hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims from their homes.
Across the border in Myanmar, the government said security patrols had been increased in the conflict area ahead of the anniversary for fear of further violence. Members of the mostly Buddhist Rakhine ethnic group and Hindus from Rakhine state said they would hold events to remember those killed by Rohingya militants in attacks that triggered the crisis.
Thousands of refugees, from children to the elderly, marched prayed and chanted slogans in events across the sprawling camps in southern Bangladesh. Many wore black ribbons to commemorate what they said was the start of the ""Rohingya genocide"".
""We prayed the morning prayers inside our house over the sound of bullets. We were so scared,"" said Aisha, 47, one of dozens of women at a gathering in the Kutupalong camp, recalling the outbreak of the conflict.
""Today marks 365 days since that day. So I want to say, we want justice."" 
(Graphic: One year on, no end in sight - https://tmsnrt.rs/2P1V4Zg)
After the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) attacked 30 Myanmar police posts and a military base in the early hours of Aug. 25, 2017, Myanmar troops swept through villages. Around 700,000 Rohingya have since fled, according to United Nations agencies.
Rohingya who crossed the border reported killings, rapes and arson carried out by security forces, in what the UN's top human rights official said seemed to be a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"". 
The government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has denied allegations of atrocities made by the refugees, saying that security forces lawfully suppressed Muslim militants in Rakhine.
Government spokesman Zaw Htay told Reuters on Friday that Myanmar did not tolerate human rights abuses, and had set up a commission of inquiry that included two veteran international diplomats to look into the Rakhine crisis. 
International pressure on Myanmar has been growing, however. U.N.-mandated investigators are set to publish a report on the crisis on Monday and the United Nations Security Council will hold a briefing on Myanmar on Tuesday.
In a statement ahead of the anniversary, 132 sitting parliamentarians from five other countries in Southeast Asia issued a statement calling for Myanmar officials to face trial at the International Criminal Court (ICC).
The ICC is currently considering whether it has jurisdiction in the crisis. Bangladesh is a member of the court, but Myanmar is not.
FEARS OF MORE VIOLENCE
Myanmar had stepped up police patrols in northern Rakhine state fearing fresh attacks by militants around the anniversary, government spokesman Zaw Htay said.
""We are very, very concerned about the possibility of terrorist attacks and we've already picked up security enforcement,"" said Zaw Htay.
ARSA said on Saturday it would ""continue our struggle for our right to exist"".
The group had ""come to existence only to defend, salvage and protect Rohingya people"" from the Myanmar government and military, it said in a statement attributed to its chief, Ata Ullah, and posted on a Twitter account previously used by it.
In the Rakhine state capital of Sittwe, the state's biggest political party, the Arakan National Party, held a ceremony to commemorate security personnel and Rakhine and Hindu people they say were killed by Rohingya insurgents in the attacks. 
In Myanmar's main city, Yangon, another group said it was holding a prayer ceremony at a Hindu temple later on Saturday.

Myanmar's government said ARSA was responsible for the deaths of non-Muslim villagers as well as security personnel last year. The group denies targeting civilians.

Turkey's lira has tumbled some 40 percent this year as investor concerns over Erdogan's grip on monetary policy and a growing dispute with the United States put pressure on the currency.
Erdogan has cast the rapid deterioration of the lira as an ""economic war"" and accused Washington of targeting Turkey over the fate of Andrew Brunson, an American pastor being tried in Turkey on terrorism charges that he denies. 
The lira firmed against the U.S. dollar in thin holiday trade on Friday, after having hit a record low of 7.24 to the dollar earlier this month.
In two separate statements to commemorate the anniversaries of the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 and Victory Day, Erdogan said the unity of Turks against attacks targeting their political and economic independence would prevail.
""As we tackle attacks against the Turkish economy today, our biggest guarantee is the commitment and determination of every member of our people to take hold of their independence, nation, and future,"" Erdogan said.
A Turkish court last week rejected an appeal for Brunson's release, drawing a stiff rebuke from President Donald Trump, who said the United States would not take the detention ""sitting down"".
Separately, after each downgrading Turkey by one notch, ratings agency Standard & Poor's said it expected a recession next year while Moody's said a weakening of Turkey's public institutions had made policymaking less predictable.
Fitch Ratings had earlier said the absence of an orthodox monetary policy response to the lira's fall and the rhetoric of Turkish authorities had ""increased the difficulty of restoring economic stability and sustainability"".
Erdogan, who has cast the currency crisis as no different than attacks on Turkey's flag or call to prayer, has repeatedly asked Turks to convert their gold and dollars into lira to prop up the ailing economy, saying Turkey would overcome the crisis.

On Saturday, he said that nobody would keep Turkey from reaching its 2023, 2053 and 2071 targets, dates that mark the centennial anniversary of the Turkish Republic, the 600th anniversary of the conquering of Istanbul, and the 1000th anniversary of the Battle of Manzikert respectively.

""After the Cuts"" is the dystopian story of Jim, a retired mechanic, and his wife Agnes who cannot afford medical treatment when she is diagnosed with cancer. Years into the future, healthcare in Britain is no longer free.
The performance coincides with the celebration of the seventieth anniversary of Britain's National Health Service (NHS) and its ""cradle to grave"" care. The anniversary has provoked public reflection on its integrity as tight government budgets put pressure on services. 
Cost restraints amid the growing demands of an aging population have compounded anxiety over the consequences of Britain's exit from the European Union next year, and the potential impact on the supply of medicines and staff.
The subject is close to the public's heart, director Beth Morton told Reuters at the world's biggest arts and culture festival in Edinburgh.
""The audiences react so differently (...) some laugh a lot, in serious places too, perhaps because of discomfort. People cry, because they feel the human connection,"" she said.
""The message is not to take the NHS for granted.""
Accompanied by dim lighting and a soundtrack that is by turns mournful and menacing, the setting in a small performing space creates a charged atmosphere. 
The drama culminates a scene where Jim operates on his wife to a backdrop of metallic, violent sound effects.
Despite the grim topic, the play is also peppered with bittersweet jokes: the couple laugh over the costs of a hospital trip where they are billed for electricity, water and toilet trips and Agnes is continually compared to the broken vacuum cleaner, which Jim haphazardly mends.
A recent poll found the NHS is a principle concern of British voters, with 77 percent of the public backing an increase in public spending on healthcare.

The show will tour Britain in spring 2019.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Pope Francis vowed on Saturday to end the ""repugnant"" sexual exploitation of children by Catholic clergy as he made a highly-charged visit to once devout Ireland where years of reported abuse have driven many Irish away from the Church.
On the first papal visit to Ireland in almost four decades, Francis said in a speech at a state event that was also attended by some abuse survivors that it was to the Church's shame it had not addressed these ""crimes"" and he said he was signalling a greater commitment to eliminating this ""scourge"".
More than three-quarters of Ireland's population flocked to see Pope John Paul II in 1979 when divorce and contraception were illegal. Francis was greeted by far smaller numbers.
But years of sexual abuse scandals have shattered the credibility of the Church as a moral leader. In the past three years, Irish voters have approved abortion and gay marriage in referendums, defying its wishes.
However, flag-waving supporters still gathered from five or six deep along many parts of Francis's route, although in other parts he greeted crowds from his popemobile by a more sparse turnout.
""I cannot fail to acknowledge the grave scandal caused in Ireland by the abuse of young people by members of the Church charged with responsibility for their protection and education,"" Francis said at the state event.
""The failure of ecclesiastical authorities - bishops, religious superiors, priests and others - adequately to address these repugnant crimes has rightly given rise to outrage and remains a source of pain and shame for the Catholic community.""
In unprepared remarks, Francis added a reference to a letter he addressed last Monday to all the world's Catholics on the abuse crisis, saying he wanted it to signal ""a greater commitment to eliminating this scourge in the Church, at any cost"". 
One of the abuse survivors present, Colm O'Gorman, called the pope's remarks a staggering effort at deflection that failed to acknowledge what O'Gorman said was the Vatican's role in covering up the crimes. 
""It was quite shocking actually in some ways,"" O'Gorman, a leading abuse campaigner, told national broadcaster RTE.
Large images of abuse victims and the hashtag #Stand4Truth - promoting a gathering of survivors and supporters elsewhere in Dublin when the pope says mass on Sunday - were projected onto some of the city's most recognized buildings on Friday night. 
They included Dublin's Pro Cathedral, where on Saturday Francis prayed before a candle commemorating abuse victims that was first lit in 2011. 
But despite the lack of enthusiasm among some people, pictures of the pope were on the front pages of every newspaper on Saturday and there was excitement among those on the streets.
""I think it's absolutely marvelous. There are one or two objectors, but I think they should keep their objections to themselves and get into the spirit of the thing,"" said Christina O'Riordan, a 76-year-old retired teacher. 
Despite changes in Irish society, Francis asked that Ireland would not forget ""the powerful strains of the Christian message"" that have sustained it in the past, and can continue to do so in the future.
About a quarter of the 2.7 million who greeted John Paul II were expected to turn out for Francis.
""The crowd is smaller than I thought. It's a good crowd, but wouldn't be near what you'd get for (Saint) Patrick's Day,"" said Christy Moore, 59, referring to Ireland's national holiday as he sold papal flags wearing an 'I love Pope Francis' hat . 
""It was much much bigger (in 1979). There's not that much interest in it now."" 
A TIME FOR ACTION, NOT WORDS
Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who last year became Ireland's first gay leader, told Francis that the wounds of clerical child abuse that stained the Irish state were still open and there was much to be done to bring about justice and healing for victims.
A damning report last week into abuse in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, which followed scandals in Australia and Chile, was all too tragically familiar in Ireland, Varadkar said, adding that the time had come for a very different Ireland to build a new relationship with the Church.
""Holy Father, I ask that you use your office and influence to ensure this is done here in Ireland and across the world,"" Varadkar said.
""We must now ensure that from words flow actions.""
In other protests gay rights activists hung rainbow umbrellas from a nearby bridge while a silent vigil will be held on Sunday at the site of a former Church-run home for unwed mothers where an unmarked grave with the remains of hundreds of babies was found in 2014.
The Vatican has said Francis would meet Irish victims of clergy sexual abuse.

The pope, who traveled through Dublin in a blue Skoda in keeping with his shunning of limousines and bulletproof cars, said Church leaders needed to remedy past mistakes and adopt stringent norms to ensure they do not happen again.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has been detained in Moscow over his participation in an anti-government protest earlier this year, his spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh wrote on Twitter on Saturday. 
Navalny was detained outside his Moscow apartment on Saturday afternoon for a reason that was initially unclear.
But after he spent a few hours at a police station, Yarmysh said Navalny had been detained over a brief appearance at a rally in Moscow in January that called for a boycott of the presidential election in March that he said would be rigged.
Navalny was not charged but his lawyer said at the time he would have to face court at a later date.
He had been planning protests on Sept. 9 against the Russian government's unpopular plans to raise the pension age. The opposition leader was barred from running in the March election that President Vladimir Putin won in a landslide victory. 
His spokeswoman said following his detention on Saturday, the 42-year-old was taken from the police station to hospital to treat a suspected fractured finger, an injury that he sustained when being detained.
Navalny, who has been jailed several times for organizing anti-Kremlin protests, will face a court hearing on Monday and will remain in custody until then, Yarmysh said.
He was last sentenced to 30 days in prison in May for his role in organizing nationwide protests against Putin.
He had called for demonstrations in more than 90 towns and cities under the slogan ""Putin is not our tsar"" to protest what he says is the Russian president's autocratic rule.

Navalny said he was excluded from the election on a false pretext. Putin, 65, won his biggest ever election victory, extending his grip over Russia for six more years.

The farm complex, which consists of three adjoining properties and is located in the southern county of Braila, is owned by Romanian company TEBU Consult.
""On Friday morning I sent samples to the national reference lab and tests confirmed the existence of the virus. From Monday, all pigs at the farms, or 140,000, will be culled,"" DSV Braila director Gicu Dragan told state news agency Agerpres.
Dragan said the farms have used water from the nearby river Danube. The official said he had heard reports that some smallholders had been dumping the corpses of infected pigs into the Danube, suggesting the highly contagious virus might have been spread by river water.
""We've been focusing on mainland and the virus might have emerged from the waters,"" he said.
Romania has reported hundreds of outbreaks of the disease among pigs kept in backyards and smallholdings as well as several large private farms located especially in the south of the country. About 100,000 pigs have been culled so far.
African swine fever affects pigs and wild boar and has spread in Eastern Europe in recent years. It does not affect humans.
Hungary, Russia, Poland, Ukraine and Romania are among the countries affected, alarming governments and pig farmers due the pace at which it has spread.

President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers in May and is reimposing sanctions on Tehran, while other parties to the accord are trying to find ways to save the agreement.
""We are still waiting for Europe to take action on the sale of Iranian oil and the preservation of banking channels,"" the Iranian foreign minister said.
Zarif also defended the European Union's decision on Thursday to provide 18 million euros ($21 million) in aid to Iran to offset the impact of U.S. sanctions, part of efforts to salvage the 2015 deal to limit Tehran's nuclear ambitions.
""This is a package that will help both sides have communication with each other and it doesn't have anything to do with the nuclear agreement and other hype,"" the minister said, according to ISNA.
The top U.S. envoy on Iran, Brian Hook, criticized the EU aid to Tehran on Friday and said it sent ""the wrong message at the wrong time.""

The EU funding is part of a wider package of 50 million euros earmarked in the EU budget for Iran, which has threatened to stop complying with the nuclear accord if it fails to see the economic benefit of relief from sanctions.

Sotoudeh said she was launching her protest over the recent arrest of a prominent civil rights activist and the harassment of his, and her own, family by security forces.
Sotoudeh served about half of a six-year jail sentence imposed in 2010 for spreading propaganda and conspiring to harm state security - charges she denied - before being freed in 2013.
She was arrested again in June and her husband, Reza Khandan, told Iranian media she is facing security charges.
""Since none of my correspondence with the authorities has produced a result, I have no choice but to start a hunger strike as of [August 25, 2018] in protest against the judicial arrests and pressure against my family, relatives and friends,"" Sotoudeh wrote on Khandan's Facebook page.
She added the words: ""With the hope of the establishment of law and justice in our dear country Iran.""
Sotoudeh, who has represented Iranian opposition activists, embarked on an earlier 50-day hunger strike in 2012 against a travel ban on her daughter.
Her case then caused an international outcry in which the United States and the human rights group Amnesty International criticized the Islamic Republic and she was freed in September 2013 ahead of a visit to the United Nations by President Hassan Rouhani, soon after he was swept into office in part on promises of liberal reforms.
Sotoudeh recently represented a number of women who have removed their headscarves, or hijab, in public to protest against Iran’s mandatory Islamic dress code for women, according to the Center for Human Rights in Iran, a New York-based advocacy group.

713,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2018 10:38AM ET</span>",Trump cancels Pompeo's trip to North Korea over stalled nuclear diplomacy,"By Matt Spetalnick and David Brunnstrom
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump abruptly canceled his top diplomat's planned trip to North Korea on Friday, publicly acknowledging for the first time that his effort to get Pyongyang to denuclearize had stalled since his summit with the North's leader.
Trump partly blamed China for the lack of progress with North Korea and suggested that talks with Pyongyang, led so far by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, could be on hold until after Washington resolved its bitter trade dispute with Beijing.
It was a dramatic shift of tone for Trump, who had previously hailed his June 12 summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a success and said the North Korean nuclear threat was over, despite no real sign Pyongyang was willing to give up its nuclear weapons.
But Trump still kept the door open to a second summit with Kim, with whom the president recently said he has ""great chemistry.""""I have asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo not to go to North Korea, at this time, because I feel we are not making sufficient progress with respect to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,"" Trump wrote on Twitter.
The North Korean mission to the United Nations declined to comment.
Negotiations have been all but deadlocked since the June summit in Singapore. Pompeo has pressed for tangible steps toward North Korea's abandonment of its nuclear arsenal while Pyongyang is demanding that Washington first make concessions of its own.
Trump's statement came just a day after Pompeo said he would again visit North Korea and would take his new special envoy, former auto industry executive Stephen Biegun, with him.
But Trump asked Pompeo not to go during a Friday meeting and they crafted the tweets together, White House officials said.
National security adviser John Bolton, considered a leading North Korea hawk, weighed in by speakerphone during a visit to Ukraine, U.S. officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Many other key officials learned of Trump's decision by seeing the crawl across a television screen, some during a meeting on North Korea negotiations, officials said.
Some U.S. intelligence and defense officials had considered Pompeo's latest trip to be premature and said the prospects for significant progress appeared dim.
Pompeo, who would have been making his second visit to Pyongyang since the summit, had not been due to meet Kim this time.
Trump himself was still open to another meeting with Kim, in hopes of advancing the process, but was not pleased with the latest signals from North Korea, a White House official said.
South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha spoke to Pompeo on the phone on Saturday and expressed concern over the delay of his visit. Kang asked Pompeo to keep the momentum of dialogue with North Korea to establish denuclearization and peace on the Korean peninsula, according to the Foreign Ministry's news release.
ONUS ON CHINA 
Trump put some of the onus on China, North Korea's biggest trading partner and a crucial actor in enforcing sanctions to keep pressure on Pyongyang.
""Because of our much tougher Trading stance with China, I do not believe they are helping with the process of denuclearization as they once were (despite the UN Sanctions which are in place),"" Trump said on Twitter.
""Secretary Pompeo looks forward to going to North Korea in the near future, most likely after our Trading relationship with China is resolved,"" Trump wrote. ""In the meantime I would like to send my warmest regards and respect to Chairman Kim. I look forward to seeing him soon!""
China's Foreign Ministry on Saturday expressed ""serious concern"" about Trump's comments, which it called ""irresponsible,"" and said it made ""stern representations"" to U.S. officials. It said China would continue to play a positive role in working towards decentralization on the Korean peninsula.
Trump told Reuters on Monday he believed Kim had taken specific steps toward denuclearization and that they would ""most likely"" meet again. 
Kelly Magsamen a former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense for Asian affairs, said Trump was undermining his leverage with Kim as well as that of Pompeo and his new envoy.
""It's fine to not send the Secretary due to lack of progress, but don't then also talk about how you are eager to meet with KJU and how China is thwarting you,"" she tweeted.
Christopher Hill, a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea, tweeted: ""Looks like @realDonaldTrump has begun to worry about #NorthKorea intentions. Good decision especially if otherwise Pompeo would have returned empty handed.""
Kim made a broad, vague commitment in Singapore to work toward denuclearization of the Korean peninsula but has given no sign of willingness to give up his arsenal unilaterally.
Talks since then have made little headway, with the two sides far apart on denuclearization and the U.S. insistence for this to happen before North Korea sees any sanctions relief.
Pompeo left his last visit to Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, only for North Korea within hours to denounce his ""gangster-like demands.""
U.S. officials have been trying without success to persuade North Korea to detail the extent of its nuclear arsenal.
Trump's decision came just days after the U.N. nuclear watchdog reported it had not found any indication that North Korea had stopped its nuclear activities.
However, some analysts suggested Trump's move may also be a negotiating ploy. In May, Trump announced he was calling off his planned summit with Kim, citing Pyongyang's ""open hostility,"" only to reverse himself eight days later.

The cancellation follows two days of U.S.-China trade talks in Washington that ended with no sign of progress toward resolving a deepening trade war between the world's two largest economies and no plans for more talks in the near term.

Reacting to comments by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton about Washington's possible strong reaction in the event of a chemical or biological attack in the Syrian region of Idlib, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said: ""We warn the Americans and their allies against taking new reckless steps in Syria.""
""We are hearing ultimatums from Washington ... and it does not affect our determination to continue our policy for the total elimination of terrorist epicenters in Syria and the return of this country to a normal life,"" RIA quoted Ryabkov as saying. 
The Idlib region, a refuge for civilians and rebels displaced from other areas of Syria as well as powerful jihadist forces, was hit by a wave of air strikes and shelling this month, in a possible prelude to a full-scale government offensive.
Russia earlier this week presented proposals to the Turkish authorities on resolving the situation in Idlib, a northwestern Syrian region that borders Turkey. 
Turkey has backed some rebel groups in region and set up a dozen military observation posts. It is trying to avert an attack by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who is backed by Moscow. 
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem is set to visit Moscow at the end of the month.

MENA said the militants, some of whom were armed with explosive belts, tried to storm a checkpoint on the coastal road near the city of el-Arish, the North Sinai provincial capital.
It quoted a source as saying police officers confronted the militants, killing four of them while the rest fled.
Security forces recovered 10 explosive charges, four automatic rifles, three suicide belts, rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) and hand grenades, MENA said.
Local media published pictures of at least two men, one lying on an asphalt road and another on the sand, and separate photographs of weapons found on them, including four AK-47 assault rifles, one RPG launcher, gun magazines and what appeared as suicide belts.
The agency made no mention of any casualties among the police.
An interior ministry spokesman could not immediately be reached for a comment.
The operation began after President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi ordered the army and security forces to crush militants after gunmen killed hundreds of worshippers at a mosque in Sinai last November.
Saturday's deaths raised to at least 329 the number of suspected militants killed in the campaign.
Egypt says fighting Islamist militants was a priority to restore security to the country of some 96 million people after years of turmoil that followed Arab Spring protests in 2011.
Sisi's critics say his presidency has brought a harsh crackdown on dissent.

HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe's main opposition leader said on Saturday he had a legitimate claim to lead the southern African nation after rejecting a court ruling that confirmed President Emmerson Mnangagwa as winner of the July 30 presidential election.
Nelson Chamisa maintained that he had won the first election since the departure of Robert Mugabe last November and said the Constitutional Court had foiled his bid to subpoena the election commission to provide critical proof to bolster his case.
The court dismissed Chamisa's challenge on Friday saying he had failed to prove his allegations of vote fraud. 
A widely condemned army crackdown in response to post-election violence by opposition supporters left six people dead on Aug. 1, recalling the heavy-handed security tactics that marked Mugabe's 37-year rule.
""I respectfully disagree and reject the position that was arrived at by the constitutional court,"" Chamisa told reporters in Harare.
""President Mnangagwa is disputed as leader. I have a legitimate claim that I am supposed to be leading the people of Zimbabwe,"" Chamisa said, adding that he would not attend Mnangagwa's inauguration on Sunday.
Last month's election, in which Mnangagwa and Chamisa were the main contenders, was expected to pull Zimbabwe out of its diplomatic isolation, end international sanctions and launch an economic recovery. 
But the vote has once again left the nation polarized after violence flared on the streets of Harare, and Chamisa, who leads the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), mounted his legal challenge.
Chamisa says he won the election with 2.6 million votes compared with two million for Mnangagwa but he has provided no evidence. The official result showed Mnangagwa winning with 2.4 million votes to Chamisa's 2.1 million.
Chamisa acknowledged that, with the Constitutional Court's decision, ""the legal route has come to a dead end"".
He said his party's executive would meet on Wednesday to plot its next move and repeated that peaceful street protests were an option to ""protect the people's victory"".
EU and Commonwealth observers said the election passed off largely peacefully but listed several problems, including voter intimidation, distrust of the electoral commission and its delay in releasing results. The observers also heavily criticized the army crackdown on protesters.
Responding to Mnangagwa's comments on Twitter that his door and arms were open to Chamisa, the 40-year-old politician said any talks with the ruling party could only be about resolving the president's legitimacy and ""vicious cycle of disputed elections"".
Chamisa's comments will do little to ease tension in a country that has been caught up in disputed polls since the MDC contested its first election in 2000.
In separate statements on Friday, the European Union urged all parties to ""call for calm and restraint"" after the court ruling, while the United States called for the parties to respect the ""constitution and the rule of law.""

After his inauguration on Sunday, Mnangagwa faces the challenge of persuading the international community that the army crackdown and lapses in the election process will not derail his promise of reforms to overcome corruption and mismanagement under Mugabe.

The prosecutor's office said it was still waiting for a medical report to determine what caused the death of John and Susan Cooper who passed away hours apart on Tuesday while staying at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel in Egypt's popular Red Sea resort of Hurghada.
Britain's Thomas Cook, which organized the trip, said on Friday it had received further reports of illness among guests at the hotel, without elaborating.
The hotel said on Friday that there had not been a rise in cases of illness.
In a statement, the Egyptian public prosecutor said that engineers assigned to check the room where the deceased couple had been staying concluded that ""all equipment was sound and that there was no leakage or emission of any poisonous or harmful gases"".
""All equipment was working properly and had no faults,"" it added.
But the statement said the prosecution was still awaiting the results of a forensic analysis of samples taken from the couple, and promised to issue a detailed report.
Egyptian officials said on Friday that both deaths were from heart failure, but the public prosecutor said the cause was still not yet clear.

The deaths come as Egypt is trying to revive tourism, a crucial source of income, while the economy is still struggling from the years of turmoil that followed a 2011 popular uprising.

Authorities are investigating the cause of the blaze at the four-story Bailong Hot Springs Leisure Hotel, an inexpensive spa resort visited mainly by domestic tourists, which broke out just after 4:30 a.m. (2030 GMT Friday).
The People's Daily newspaper cited fire officials as saying the blaze had started in a kitchen on the second floor.
Flames swept through an area of about 400 square meters (4,300 square feet) before being extinguished after three hours, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported. Footage showed rescue workers picking through the charred building.
Casualties treated in hospital were in the 40s to 70s age range, the newspaper said, citing the Harbin First Hospital. Further details about those who were killed were not immediately available. 
An earlier death toll of 18 rose by one after a victim died in hospital, officials said.
China has a patchy record for building safety regulations, and the country's Ministry of Emergency Management said it would launch nationwide fire safety inspections in buildings such as hotels, sauna, hospitals, schools and shopping malls, CCTV reported on Saturday.
Beijing's municipal government launched a 40-day ""special operation"" targeting fire code and building safety violations after an apartment fire in the Chinese capital in November killed 19 people.

Harbin, in the far northeast of China and home to a large Russian population during the early 20th century, is famous for buildings dating from that era as well as a popular winter snow and ice festival.

Sher Khan Fernod, the founder and former head of Kabul Bank, who was convicted of siphoning funds from the bank in a case involving the brother of former Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai, died of heart attack in Kabul prison on Friday.
""Fernod had served three years of his jail term. He died on Friday morning and his body will be handed over to his family,"" said Sayed Ghafoor Ahmed Javed, a spokesman in the defense ministry.
The two former heads of Kabul Bank, founder Sher Khan Fernod and his colleague Haji Khalil Ferozi, had been convicted in the initial inquiry of taking $810 million of the stolen money and were both sentenced to jail for five years. Their jail terms were tripled in 2014 after the case was re-opened.
The theft forced the Afghan government in 2010 to bail out the bank, then the country's biggest, after deposits dried up.
The government later re-launched it as New Kabul Bank. It has branches in over 28 of the 34 provinces.
The problems at Kabul Bank triggered a fiscal crisis in a country that depends on foreign donors to pay its bills and prompted the International Monetary Fund to temporarily suspend international aid to Afghanistan.

Weak regulation continues to undermine confidence in Afghanistan’s fragile banking system. In recent years international financial watchdogs have threatened to place Afghanistan on a blacklist, unless the government does more to enforce laws to regulate its banking sector.

HONOLULU (Reuters) - Hawaii was spared a direct hit by a major hurricane as Lane, once a monster tempest, rapidly weakened into a tropical storm, even as it unleashed severe flooding on the Big Island and threatened to drench Oahu and Maui.
Lane, with maximum sustained winds diminishing to near 70 mph (110 kph), was forecast to slowly make its nearest approach to land just west of the U.S. Pacific island chain over the weekend, bringing tropical storm conditions to Maui and the state's most populous island, Oahu, late on Friday. 
More than two feet (60 cm) of rain had fallen in a 36-hour period by Friday night on the windward side of the island of Hawaii, popularly known as the Big Island, where the Weather Service reported ""catastrophic flooding."" More than 40 inches of rain was recorded in Piihonua and Waiakea on the island late on Friday, the weather service said. 
Flash flooding and mudslides on the Big Island forced road closures and evacuations as police and emergency crews conducted numerous rescues of people stranded in vehicles and homes by high water on Friday.
""Roads all over are impassable due to extreme flooding,"" said Hawaii resident Lili Koi on Twitter late on Friday night. ""That means ambulances and even police are not able to get through. Say some prayers and be safe."" 
A number of structures on the island of Hawaii were destroyed, said Melissa Dye, a Weather Service spokeswoman in Honolulu.
She said two Hilo-area neighborhoods were evacuated. But no injuries were reported.
""I've never seen this, so much devastation of the river flowing down off of Komohana (River),"" said long-time resident Tracy Pacheco in Hilo. ""I just came from Pahale Park, and there's no park.""
FORECASTS LESS DIRE
Official bulletins grew less dire through the day. Into the evening, forecasts made clear that Hawaii had been spared from the threat of its first direct hit by a major hurricane in a quarter of a century.
Lane was downgraded on Friday to a Category 1, the lowest ranking on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, as it churned through the Pacific south of Oahu, the National Weather Service said. It was downgraded again to a tropical storm shortly before 5 p.m. as its maximum sustained wind speeds fell below 74 mph.
The storm was nearly stationary south of Hawaii on Friday night. It was expected to move slowly toward the northwest later and then turn west on Saturday and continue over the weekend, the National Weather Service said in an advisory. 
Forecasts predicted that Lane, which peaked as a Category 5 hurricane with top sustained winds of 160 mph (260 kph) earlier in the week, to diminish into a tropical depression by early on Sunday.
The turn of events was welcomed by residents who had spent much of the past few days stocking up on food, water, gasoline and batteries and boarding up their windows.
TORRENTIAL DOWNPOURS, EVACUATIONS
Still, the storm posed a considerable weather hazard to large parts of the state, with the island of Hawaii bearing the brunt of torrential downpours from Lane.
On Oahu, where 70 percent of Hawaii's 1.4 million residents live, Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell told the Weather Channel that the city has moved its emergency-response equipment to higher ground for the time being. 
He said Honolulu, the state's capital and largest city, is vulnerable to floods and slides because it is partly ringed by mountains.
""We have asked our residents in these areas where they know it floods to be ready to leave,"" Caldwell said, adding that 1,100 people were staying in emergency shelters throughout the city.
New Yorker Rigo Pagoada, 43, who was on vacation on Oahu with his family, said he felt lucky it had been largely spared. 
""We've been very fortunate,"" he said. ""It's sad to see the (impact on) the Big Island."" 
Hawaii's major airports remained open during the storm, though 22 flights were canceled at Honolulu's main airport, according to online tracking service FlightAware.com. Several airlines also canceled services to Kahului Airport on Maui in anticipation of severe weather, the state transportation department said.

She now lives with her family at the Kutupalong refugee camp in Cox's Bazar, the world's largest, among some 700,000 Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar who have taken shelter there since last August. Her eight-month-old son was born in the camp.
""I am now anxious what my son's future will be like,"" she said. ""We are afraid. There is no education here and no hope of education there also… I don't see any future here and there is also no future there.""
Myanmar says it is ready to take back the Rohingya and has built transit centers to receive returnees. But a continued outflow of refugees underlines a lack of progress in addressing the crisis, a year on from the start of the army offensive on Aug. 25, 2017.
Myanmar says its military launched a legitimate counterinsurgency operation in response to a violent campaign from within the Rohingya minority, who are mostly denied citizenship in the southeast Asian nation.
Many in Buddhist-majority Myanmar refer to the Rohingya as ""Bengali"", which most in the Muslim minority regard as a derogatory term used to suggest they are interlopers from Bangladesh.
The Rohingya exodus has threatened Myanmar's tense transition to democracy and shattered the image of its leader, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, outside the country.
Her government has rejected most allegations of atrocities made by refugees against the security forces.

""I am afraid that if we are sent back to Burma, they will kill us,"" Begum said. ""We will go there to die. If the (Myanmar) government accepts us as Rohingya citizens then we will go, otherwise we will not.""

The protesters had gathered in support of a parliamentary candidate who electoral officials had disqualified over his suspected links with illegal armed groups.
Eight people were also wounded. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack.
Attaullah Khogyani, a spokesman for the provincial governor, said the explosion happened when supporters of the disqualified candidate were trying to shut down the election commission office.
""We had requested the protesters to stop their demonstrations because they could be targeted by militants but they rejected our security message,"" he said.
A suicide bomber blew himself up outside an Afghan election office in the capital, Kabul, earlier this month when protesters gathered to challenge the commission's decision to disqualify 35 candidates from contesting upcoming parliamentary polls. 
One police official was killed in that attack.
A ban on dozens of Afghan strongmen and lawmakers from running for parliament because of suspected links to illegal armed groups has spurred threats and protests to disrupt a general election that is already at risk from worsening security.
The Taliban have warned people not to vote in the October polls and dozens of people have been killed in militant attacks on voter registration centers.
Supporters of disqualified candidates have held sit-in protests outside a number of election commission offices around Afghanistan over the past two weeks.
Security forces launched a drive to evict them on Saturday.

MECCA, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - On the plain of Arafat, I stood among hundreds of thousands of people who were all trying to reach the top of Mount Mercy, whilst covering my first haj after 20 years as a photographer for Reuters.
Instead of praying in the traditional way, people were doing it in the “21st-century” way — using their mobile phones to read out prayers and take pictures at the mountain.
There was one woman sporting a bright turquoise ring that caught my eye. Decades of haj tradition dictate the norm is to not wear jewelry.
My first time walking around the holy city of Mecca, I was amazed by the mixture of people. There were Africans, Asians, Europeans, Americans, and Arabs, all coexisting in this tiny place.
In Jamarat, during the stoning of the devil ritual, where pilgrims hurl pebbles at a giant wall, men and women mixed together without the restriction of gender segregation that has been custom in public places in Saudi Arabia for decades.
One day, after taking pictures of sunset prayers at the Grand Mosque, I sat on the side of the road watching thousands of men and women file out. I was surprised at how closely they were all crowded together, something that is frowned upon in most Muslim countries.
That is part of what makes this place so special for me; the haj unites all Muslims, even those who might be waging war against each other back in their own countries.
""When the war began in Yemen I never would have imagined that I would one day have the capability to come to haj,"" Ibtissam Al Assiri, a 39-year-old pilgrim from Yemen, told me. ""God bestowed this place upon Muslims to unite us.""
'THE HOUSE OF GOD'
One of the lasting impressions I have is from the sound of pilgrims reciting in unison the main verses of the haj rituals. It sounded like a perfectly-synched orchestra. It gave me chills and filled my heart with joy.
More than two million pilgrims attended this year's five-day ritual, which retraces the route Prophet Mohammed took 14 centuries ago. Many Muslims save their entire lives to attend.
At the stoning ritual, where pilgrims hurl pebbles at three walls in a symbolic commitment to resist the devil's temptations, I met two 60-year-old women in wheelchairs at their first haj.
Djumhuriya, from southern Iraq, made the three-day journey by car to reach Mecca.
""I have dreamed of performing haj for a long time. It took me so long to make it come true. The road from Basra was long, but I was so excited to see the Kaaba, 'the house of God.' Today, I feel like I am born again,"" she told me.
Sanjeeda Bagam came from Pakistan with her son, who was pushing her wheelchair.
""When I arrived in Mecca and saw the Kaaba, I had a feeling like never before: joy erased my entire past, as if I only knew the present right here,"" she said.
The extreme heat is a challenge at haj, with daytime temperatures topping 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) this week. As a photographer, I ended up walking a lot more than the 40 kilometers (25 miles) for an average pilgrim.
The light is also very harsh during most of the day. That is a photographer's nightmare, because it means there were only a couple of hours just after sunrise and then again just before sunset when I could get the pictures I wanted.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - An island volcano on the north coast of Papua New Guinea erupted early on Saturday, forcing 2,000 villagers to flee from lava flows, the National Disaster Centre said.
Manam Island, just 10 km (6 miles) wide, is one of the Pacific nation's most active volcanoes and is home to roughly 9,000 people.
Three villages were directly in the path of the lava flow and residents had to be evacuated to safer ground, Martin Mose, director of the PNG National Disaster Centre, told Reuters by phone.
The Rabaul Volcano Observatory (RVO) reported the eruption began at 6 a.m. local time (2000 GMT Friday), sending an ash column 15 km (50,000 feet) above sea level.
The ash falls were so heavy that trees broke under the weight, the RVO said in an information bulletin.
""The most affected areas are Baliau and Kuluguma and due to the very poor visibility caused by the ash fall, people are using torch light to move around,"" it said.
The RVO's Steve Saunders said it was an unusually large eruption.
""There are no casualties as far as we know but we are telling people to keep away from valleys for risk of mud flows ... there's a heavy thick blanket of ash on the flank and if there is heavy rainfall, we are making people aware of the threat,"" he said by phone.
Saunders said the initial phase of the eruption was over but a new vent had opened, indicating more activity may be likely.
The Darwin Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (DVAAC) issued a threat warning to aviation to reroute around the cloud, which was above the cruising level of commercial airlines.
The cloud was expected to dissipate over the next 12 hours, DVAAC meteorologist Amanda Alford told Reuters.
Previous eruptions on Manam have killed residents who breathed in the ash or were buried by landslides, according to volcanic information website volcanodiscovery.com.

TAOS, N.M. (Reuters) - Two people arrested for alleged child abuse at a New Mexico settlement faced new charges on Friday in connection with the death of a toddler whose body was recently discovered at the site, the Taos County Sheriff's Office said.
Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, the father of the boy whose body was found, and his wife Jany Leveille were charged with abuse of a child resulting in death, which carries a potential life sentence, Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe said in a statement. They were also charged with conspiracy to commit abuse of a child.
The new counts increase the severity of charges against Leveille and Ibn Wahhaj, who were among five people charged with child abuse at the makeshift compound near Amalia, New Mexico. 
Prosecutors have also accused Ibn Wahhaj of leading weapons training for two teenage sons at the settlement to carry out attacks on ""corrupt institutions.""
""We now know the child died on December 24, 2017 and was concealed at the compound,"" Hogrefe said in the statement.
Leveille's lawyer Kelly Golightley declined to comment. Tom Clark, who is representing Ibn Wahhaj, did not respond to a request for comment.
The charges follow nearly three weeks of interviews and examinations of electronic and written data seized after police raided the settlement on Aug. 3, the sheriff's office said.
Prosecutors have portrayed Ibn Wahhaj, the son of a prominent New York Muslim cleric, as the leader of the group and Leveille as its spiritual leader.
Defense lawyers have said the defendants were practising their rights to religious freedom and to own firearms and are being discriminated against for being black and Muslim.
A Federal Bureau of Investigation agent said in court testimony on Aug. 13 that Ibn Wahhaj's severely ill son died as his father carried out ""ruqya,"" a common Islamic faith healing ritual, to cast out evil spirits from him.
Ibn Wahhaj is accused of abducting the boy from his first wife in Georgia in December.
The boy's body was found in a tunnel at their makeshift New Mexico home on Aug. 6, three days after the defendants' 11 other children were taken into protective custody following the raid. 
Leveille, a Haitian national, was transferred from Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody back to Taos County on Thursday where she is also being held on immigration charges, the sheriff's office said.

Ibn Wahhaj, his brother in law, Lucas Morton, and sisters Hujrah Wahhaj and Subhannah Wahhaj are also in Taos County jail awaiting trial.

(Reuters) - A juror who voted to convict Paul Manafort and who is also a supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump has some advice for Trump if he is considering whether to pardon his former campaign chairman: don't do it.
Paula Duncan is so far the only juror to speak out since Manafort was found guilty of 8 out of 18 counts of financial wrongdoing on Tuesday.
""He should absolutely not pardon him. I think it would be a big mistake,"" Duncan, 54, told Reuters after an on-camera interview on Friday, adding that she believed it would be a mistake from both a moral and a political perspective.
""If President Trump pardons him without him doing any time at all it would look like President Trump was saying it's OK that you broke the law. It's not OK to break the law.""
Trump weighed in on Manafort's plight while the jury was still in deliberations, calling the tax and bank fraud case against him ""very sad"" and lauding him as a ""very good person.""
Those comments, along with tweets following the verdict, have heightened speculation that Trump may look to pardon Manafort. When asked directly about the prospect, Trump has not ruled it out.
While Duncan feels Manafort should pay for his crimes, she said she believes he was targeted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading a probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.
""I don't think that Mr. Manafort would have been on trial had not the Special Counsel been looking for information on Russian collusion in the last election,"" Duncan said in the TV interview. 
""He's still guilty ... and he now needs to pay for the laws he broke.""
Duncan said that she and 10 other jurors wanted to convict Manafort on all 18 counts of tax and bank fraud and failing to declare his foreign bank accounts that he faced in the trial. It was one holdout who caused the jury to hang on 10 of the 18 counts after nearly four days of deliberations, she said.
""We had some people that were very wrapped up in it and really didn't want to stop deliberating,"" Duncan said. ""In the end we knew we were never going to change her mind.""
Even with instructions to avoid media coverage of the trial, Duncan said she and her fellow jurors would had to have been ""brain dead to not know"" the scrutiny on the case and said they were ""all very overwhelmed with the importance of our job.""
And even though she believes Manafort is guilty, Duncan said she agrees with Trump that it was time to shut down Mueller's probe.

""I just think the whole thing is a waste of taxpayer money and a way to harass the president,"" she said.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - The election commission of Democratic Republic of Congo has excluded opposition leader Jean-Pierre Bemba and three former prime ministers from the list of approved candidates for December's presidential election, which was published on Friday.
Bemba, a former warlord who earlier in August returned to the Congolese capital Kinshasa to submit his candidacy for president after a decade in prison in The Hague for war crimes, had been seen as one of the frontrunners in the race to succeed incumbent Joseph Kabila.
The commission said a separate International Criminal Court conviction for witness tampering was the reason for Bemba's exclusion from the list.
Bemba was acquitted on appeal at the International Criminal Court of war crimes and crimes against humanity for murder, rape and pillage committed by fighters he sent to Central African Republic in 2002 but his witness tampering conviction stands.
Opposition parties condemned the election commission's decision, which can be appealed before the final list is published in September.
""Once again the current regime is showing its determination to suppress the electoral process,"" they said in a joint statement before the commission published the list.
Last month, Bemba placed third in a rare public opinion poll on the likely outcome of the election, winning 17 percent support.
He is popular in western Congo, including the capital Kinshasa, and his exclusion could trigger a violent reaction by his supporters. Street battles between militiamen loyal to Bemba and state forces broke out in Kinshasha after he lost the 2006 election to Kabila.
After years of speculation over his intentions, Kabila consented earlier in August to obey the two-term limit imposed by the Central African country's constitution by not entering his name for the poll set for Dec. 23.
As a parting shot, he picked a former interior minister, who has been placed under EU sanctions, to stand instead.
His choice of a die-hard loyalist suggested that the president, who came to power after his father's assassination in 2001, intends to remain closely involved in national politics. He will be eligible to run again in 2023.

Former prime ministers Adolphe Muzito, Antoine Gizenga and Samy Badibanga were also among the six candidates excluded from the commission's list.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Pope Francis will arrive in Ireland on Saturday to find a society transformed since the last papal visit 39 years ago and beset by the kind of abuse scandals that have mired the Catholic Church in crisis again.
More than three-quarters of the Irish population flocked to see Pope John Paul II in 1979 at a time when divorce and contraception were illegal. Today, Ireland is no longer staunchly Catholic and over the past three years, voters have approved abortion and gay marriage in referendums, defying the will of the church.
Numbers lining the streets or joining Francis in prayer are expected to be about a quarter of the 2.7 million who greeted John Paul II, marking how the rock that was once Irish Catholicism has eroded since child abuse cases came to light in the 1990s.
""The Catholic Church is still very much part of our society but not at the center of it as it was 40 years ago,"" Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who last year became Ireland's first gay leader, told the BBC.
""Ireland has become a very different place in the last 40 years and our relationship with the church has changed principally because of so many revelations that have occurred around child sex abuse.""
Varadkar, who remarked how some his predecessors would have consulted bishops about public policy in decades past, will meet Francis at the start of the two-day visit and has promised to challenge the pope to do more in dealing with the abuse crisis.
Francis, facing sexual abuse crises in several countries, wrote an unprecedented letter to all Catholics this week asking each one of them to help root out ""this culture of death"" and vowing there would be no more cover ups.
He will also travel to Knock, a small western village steeped in Catholicism that welcomes 1.5 million pilgrims a year, before finishing his trip by saying mass in Dublin's Phoenix Park where a large cross erected for the 1979 visit still dominates the skyline.
The 500,000 tickets issued for the mass were quickly snapped up, although an unknown number have been booked by a boycott group called 'Say Nope To The Pope' which encouraged protestors to order tickets and not use them. 
Abuse survivors and their supporters plan to gather elsewhere in Dublin during the mass, while a silent vigil will also be held at the site of a former church-run home for unwed mothers where an unmarked grave with the remains of hundreds of babies was found in 2014.
The Vatican has said Francis will meet Irish victims of clergy sexual abuse, but the pope will also be under pressure to address the recent scandals that have led to the church's worst credibility crisis in more than 15 years. 
A damning report last week into abuse in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, combined with scandals in Australia and Chile, have formed what one Vatican official called ""a perfect storm"" and already overshadowed a trip where the main purpose is to close a week-long international Catholic gathering.
""Each time a local church has found itself facing a scandal, it is as if the church must start all over again to understand the depths of this heart of darkness,"" Barbara Thorp, the former head of the office for pastoral support and child protection in the U.S. Archdiocese of Boston, where the first abuse crisis erupted in 2002, told the gathering on Friday.

""We have a raging fire within the church. Inexplicably church leaders have shown callous indifference to the suffering of children and the vulnerable and the fire rages on.""

""Foreign aid from European taxpayers perpetuates the regime's ability to neglect the needs of its people and stifles meaningful policy changes,"" Brian Hook, the U.S. special representative for Iran, said in a statement.
""The Iranian people face very real economic pressures caused by their government's corruption, mismanagement, and deep investment in terrorism and foreign conflicts,"" he added. ""The United States and the European Union should be working together instead to find lasting solutions that truly support Iran's people and end the regime's threats to regional and global stability.""
The EU decision on Thursday to provide 18 million euros ($20.7 million) in aid to Iran was aimed at offsetting the impact of U.S. sanctions as European countries try to salvage the 2015 agreement that saw Tehran limit its nuclear ambitions.
President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the nuclear deal in May and is reimposing sanctions on Tehran, even as other parties to the accord are trying to find ways to save the agreement.
The EU funding is part of a wider package of 50 million euros earmarked in the EU budget for Iran, which has threatened to stop complying with the nuclear accord if it fails to see the economic benefit of relief from sanctions. 
The United States is pressing other countries to comply with its sanctions.
""More money in the hands of the ayatollah means more money to conduct assassinations in those very European countries,"" Hook said in his statement.
U.S. national security adviser John Bolton told Reuters during a visit to Israel earlier this week that the return of U.S. sanctions was having a strong effect on Iran's economy and popular opinion.
The U.S. sanctions dusted off this month targeted Iran's car industry, trade in gold and other precious metals, and purchases of U.S. dollars crucial to international financing and investment and trade relations. Farther-reaching sanctions are to follow in November on Iran's banking sector and oil exports.

Many members of the Christian Democrat Union supported either reinstating the military draft or a year of community service, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer told the Funke Mediengruppe newspapers and the French newspaper Ouest-France in an interview published on Saturday.
She said the party was looking at different service proposals for inclusion in the party's next election campaign.
She said nothing had been decided, and she herself had reservations, remembering her mother's stories about having to complete a mandatory year of service during the Nazi era.
But she said many party members had told her during a summer ""listening tour"" that reinstating the draft - which was scrapped in 2011 - or community service was a good idea for both native Germans and immigrants.
""If refugees complete such a year, either voluntary or compulsory, it would help their integration into the country and society. And in the populations, it would increase acceptance that refugees live among us,"" she told the newspapers.
Merkel's decision in 2015 to let in over a million migrants, many fleeing wars in the Middle East, has fueled support for far-right groups such as PEGIDA and the Alternative for Germany, now the main opposition party in parliament.
German officials said this month they had no intention of reinstating compulsory military service, citing the high cost and the difficulty of integrating draftees into the professional military.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is cutting more than $200 million in aid to the Palestinians, the State Department said on Friday, amid a deteriorating relationship with the Palestinian leadership.
A senior State Department official said without elaborating that the funds, originally planned for programs in the West Bank and Gaza, would address ""high-priority projects elsewhere.""
""We have undertaken a review of U.S. assistance to the Palestinian Authority and in the West Bank and Gaza to ensure these funds are spent in accordance with U.S. national interests and provide value to the U.S. taxpayer,"" the official said in a statement.
""As a result of that review, at the direction of the president, we will redirect more than $200 million in FY2017 Economic Support Funds originally planned for programs in the West Bank and Gaza.""
Asked where the money would be redirected and whether it would go to other Palestinian projects, another State Department official said: “We will work with Congress to redirect these funds to other policy priorities.”
Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
The announcement came at a time when the Palestinian leadership has angered the White House by boycotting its peace efforts since President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moved the embassy there, reversing decades of U.S. policy.
The status of Jerusalem - home to sites holy to the Muslim, Jewish and Christian religions - is one of the biggest obstacles to any peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Palestinians claim East Jerusalem for the capital of an independent state they seek. Israel says Jerusalem is its eternal and indivisible capital.
Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner is leading an effort to craft a peace plan meant to launch negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians to end a decades-long conflict. A decision on when the initiative would be rolled out has not yet been made.
The State Department cited the Islamist militant group Hamas' control of Gaza as part of its justification for reallocating the funds. The United States and Israel designate Hamas as a terrorist group.
The decision is almost certain to exacerbate the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. More than 2 million Palestinians are packed into the Gaza Strip, which suffers deep economic hardship.
""CHEAP BLACKMAIL""
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Executive Committee member Hanan Ashrawi accused the Trump administration of using ""cheap blackmail as a political tool.""
""The Palestinian people and leadership will not be intimidated and will not succumb to coercion,"" she said.
Ambassador Husam Zomlot, head of the PLO General Delegation to the United States, said in a statement: ""Weaponizing humanitarian and developmental aid as political blackmail does not work.""
The United States had in January announced it would withhold $65 million of $125 million that it had planned to send to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which is funded almost entirely by voluntary contributions from U.N. states, with the United states as the largest contributor.
UNRWA and the Palestinians have warned that cuts could exacerbate hardship in Gaza, an enclave that has been under Israeli and Egypt blockades designed to isolate its Islamist Hamas rulers. 
U.S. National Security adviser John Bolton told Reuters this week that UNRWA was ""a failed mechanism"" that violated standard international law on the status of refugees.
UNRWA was founded in 1949 after the first Arab-Israel war, which led to 700,000 Palestinians being forced to leave their homes or flee. It helps around 5 million Palestinian refugees, a figure that includes descendants of those displaced by the fighting
Jordan, which hosts the largest number of Palestinian refugees in the Middle East outside Palestinian territories, warned this month that a severe financial shortfall facing UNRWA could have a “catastrophic” impact on the lives of millions of refugees in the region.
U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat, criticized the Trump administration's decision.
“Inhabitants of Gaza are already suffering severe hardships under the tyranny of Hamas and border restrictions imposed by Israel. It is the Palestinian people, virtual prisoners in an increasingly volatile conflict, who will most directly suffer the consequences of this callous and ill-advised attempt to respond to Israel’s security concerns.”

J Street, a liberal pro-Israel group, called the Trump administration’s move a “moral outrage and a major strategic blunder.”

Masoum Marzouk, a former ambassador, and two other prominent opposition activists were arrested on Thursday. Marzouk had recently called for a referendum on Sisi's rule, in rare public criticism of the former general.
Marzouk, academic Yahya Kazaz, Raed Salama and four other people, whom MENA did not name, face charges of joining a terrorist group and receiving funds for terrorism, it said.
Egyptian authorities have jailed thousands of Sisi opponents and critics in recent years, including alleged Islamist militants and secular rights activists. The government has said that its actions are directed at terrorists and saboteurs trying to undermine the state.
The former general became president in 2014, a year after he led the ouster of Islamist president Mohamed Mursi after popular protests against his rule. Mursi was Egypt’s first freely elected head of state.
The standard fifteen-day detention can be renewed by authorities. Rights groups have said this often happens indefinitely without trial to people accused of terrorism-related charges.

VATICAN CITY, (Reuters) - Matt Talbot, a Dubliner who died in 1925, was a man with a drinking problem. Now, he is on his way to sainthood.
On Saturday, Pope Francis will pay tribute to him, but not by raising a glass.
Francis will instead pray before the relics of the man sometimes called the ""Holy Drinker"" and who is known as the patron of those struggling get or stay on the wagon.
Born into a poor Dublin family of 12 children and the son of a violent alcoholic father, Talbot himself began drinking heavily at the age of 12 when he worked for a wine merchant.
According to one account, he once pawned his boots in order to buy a pint at a pub.
With the help of a priest, he lifted his elbow for the last time when he was 28, vowed to stop drinking, and did not touch a drop until he died of a heart attack in 1925 at the age of 69.
He became a devout believer, going to Mass often and practicing penitential rites, such as keeping a small chain around his leg, and became a Talbot became a temperance campaigner.
With the help of a philosophy professor, he read scriptures and the writings of saints and eventually became a member of a lay branch of the Franciscans.
One of the bridges that cross the River Liffey is named after him, as are many addiction clinics around the world. A statue of Talbot stands near the bridge.
""Never go too hard on the man who can't give up drink. It is as hard to give up drink as it is to raise the dead to life again,"" he was quoted as saying, adding that both feats were possible with help from God.
In 1931, the bishop of Dublin began looking more closely at his life with the aim of seeing if a diocesan procedure to make him a saint could be started. 
It was and in 1975, Pope Paul issued a decree recognizing Talbot's ""heroic virtues,"" giving him the title ""venerable,"" one of the early steps that can lead to sainthood.
For the sainthood cause to move forward, the Church would have to attribute a miracle to Talbot.
The Church teaches that God performs miracles but that saints who are believed to be with God in heaven intercede on behalf of people who pray to them.

A miracle is usually the medically inexplicable healing of someone.

After two weeks of counting additional ballots in a district that has historically provided easy victories to Republicans, Balderson was declared by Franklin County officials as the winner over Democrat Danny O'Connor, who said on Friday he called to concede to Balderson.
In the final vote count Balderson received 104,328 votes, or 50.12 percent, and O’Connor had 102,648 votes, or 49.32 percent, according to Franklin County. 
""I'm humbled by the support I've received from voters and look forward to representing Ohio's 12th Congressional district in Congress,"" Balderson said in a statement. ""Danny O'Connor ran a hard-fought race but I look forward to earning the support of voters for a fourth time.""
The special election was viewed as a referendum on Republican President Donald Trump's leadership and a last chance to gauge Democratic strength ahead of November's midterm elections, in which the Republicans are trying to retain majorities in the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate.
Despite the loss, Democrats are hoping to parlay continued enthusiasm among their base into victories in November. Republicans are using the narrow victory as a warning that many congressional seats could be lost unless candidates invest heavily in their campaigns both through fundraising and campaigning.
The special election was called to replace former Representative Pat Tiberi, who resigned from his seat earlier this year to take a job with a business group. Because the August election was only to fill the remainder of Tiberi’s term, which ends in January, another election, again with Balderson and O'Connor, will be held in November to elect a representative for the new term. 

""We went door to door, we went house to house, we made our case for change, and the grassroots army we’ve created is not done yet,"" O'Connor said in a statement. ""In fact, we’re just getting started.""

739,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2018 02:37PM ET</span>",Former Pennsylvania altar boy says he stole from church to avenge abuse,"By Vanessa Johnston
PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Mike McDonnell was an altar boy who loved to sing Latin hymns at his church in suburban Philadelphia, but his Roman Catholic faith became a source of torment at age 12 when he woke up to find a priest molesting him in the vacation bed the clergyman forced him to share.
""From that day forth, I would never be that same child,"" said McDonnell, now 49. ""I went into shock mode and shut down. I would hold onto those secrets for 20-plus years.""
McDonnell, now a peer counselor at a drug and alcohol treatment facility, agreed to share his personal story with Reuters in the wake of a stunning grand jury report of Roman Catholic priests accused of abusing more than 1,000 children across Pennsylvania. He said he wanted to encourage other victims to emerge from the shadows to begin their own healing.
While the incident at age 12 broke him, he said the abuse started at age 10, when another priest molested him. ""At that age, I wasn't sure the things that were going on,"" he said.
His decades-long road to recovery was fraught with alcohol abuse, broken marriages and even a criminal record. The Archdiocese of Philadelphia paid for McDonnell's counseling sessions but he seldom attended. Instead he forged receipts and eventually was convicted of pocketing more than $100,000 in a theft he called payback for the abuse.
""I sought retribution in the form of submitting false invoices for a number of years,"" McDonnell told Reuters in an interview this week. 
One priest accused by McDonnell was defrocked, the other was removed from public ministry.
McDonnell joined the chorus of voices demanding Pennsylvania eliminate any statute of limitations for prosecutors to bring charges in child sex crimes cases. Youth advocates say a statute of limitations can block justice since it may take decades for children to realize they were victimized.
Some 41 U.S. states have eliminated statutes of limitations for criminally prosecuting child sex abuse. In 2002, Pennsylvania was among the first to raise the age for reporting child sexual abuse when it lifted the age to 30 from 23. Five years later it raised the age to 50.
""I was held accountable for my actions in a court of law. Can we say that about the Catholic Church today?"" McDonnell said. 

""These bishops and the dioceses and the Cardinals need to come clean. You need to tell the Catholic faith community what you did. How you covered it up, how you transferred one to another parish so that he would go on and abuse more children. No one knew more about these abuses and no one did less,"" he said.

ROME/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Italy's populist government said on Friday it would cut funds for the European Union unless other states take in boat migrants stranded in an Italian port, earning a rebuke from Brussels for making unacceptable ""threats"".
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said that envoys from EU states who met in Brussels on Friday did not reach a deal to share out the 150 migrants on board the Diciotti, an Italian coastguard ship docked in Catania since Monday.
Italy will ""act accordingly"", he said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), noting the EU had failed to live up to its principles of ""solidarity and responsibility"" and that there was a gulf ""between words and actions"" that is colored by ""hypocrisy"".
More than 650,000 people have reached Italian shores since 2014 and Rome has begun to take a rigidly anti-immigration line, saying it will not let any more rescue ships dock unless other EU states agree to take the people in. 
Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, who heads the anti-immigrant League party, has insisted they will not be allowed ashore until other EU states agree to take them in - prompting a criminal investigation into whether the migrants are being held against their will.
Salvini seemed to give some ground in a radio interview on Friday evening, suggesting he might let migrants off the Diciotti once it had been ascertained whether they were ""real refugees"".
""I'm considering the possibility of carrying out identification and recognition procedures to identify real refugees, who are the minority, from fake refugees before they disembark,"" he told state broadcaster Rai.
Salvini's government ally, Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, who leads the 5-Star Movement, has said his party will not approve next year's European Union funding if there is no action soon. 
""The soft line does not work, the hard line will be to withhold funds if they don't listen to us,"" Di Maio said.
Rejecting the Italian threats as unacceptable, the EU's executive European Commission said a solution to the Diciotti case was its ""main priority"".
""Unconstructive comments, let alone threats ... will not get us any closer to a solution,"" spokesman Alexander Winterstein told a news conference on Friday.
The issue of how to handle migrants has bitterly split the EU, although arrivals are down dramatically from their 2015 peak of more than a million.
Southern EU states such as Italy and Greece feel overrun and the bloc's eastern members refuse to host any of the new arrivals.
The easterners, who face cuts in EU development aid over their refusal to help on migration, did not attend the Brussels meeting on Friday. Malta, Italy, Spain, Greece, Luxembourg, Belgium, Germany, France, Ireland and the Netherlands were present. 
CURTAILING ARRIVALS 
In Italy, a campaign promise to further curtail arrivals helped propel the 5-Star and the League into office last June.
Deals were reached in June and July to distribute people from ships that carried rescued migrants to Italy and Malta.
But Salvini this week said countries were failing to keep their promises.
Opposition politicians who visited the Diciotti this week condemned Salvini and Di Maio. 
""The worst thing is that (the migrants) are being held hostage as a way of blackmailing Europe,"" said Laura Boldrini, a lawmaker for the left-wing Free and Equal party.
The migrants appeared to have started a hunger strike on Friday, Davide Faraone, a lawmaker in the opposition Democratic Party, said on Twitter. 
Another opposition lawmaker, Riccardo Magi, said most on board could qualify for asylum.
Magi petitioned the Catania prosecutor to open a criminal investigation into whether the migrants were being held against their will. Agrigento's chief prosecutor has opened a probe against ""unknown"" persons for holding them.
On Friday, Salvini remained defiant in the face of the investigation and said it was his job to protect the country.

""If someone is thinking about arresting me, they're mistaken, because the Italian people are asking for order, rules, respect and controlled immigration,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Thomas Frieden, a former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), was arrested in New York City on Friday on charges of sexual abuse, forcible touching and harassment of a woman last year, the New York Police Department said.
Frieden, who also once served as New York City's health commissioner, turned himself into a Brooklyn police station on Friday morning, Arlene Muniz, a police spokeswoman, said.
A 55-year-old woman filed a complaint against Frieden in July, accusing him of grabbing her buttocks against her will last October at his apartment in Brooklyn Heights, Muniz said.
Frieden, 57, had a prominent role in helping respond to the outbreaks of Ebola in West Africa in 2014 and Zika fever that began in Brazil in 2015. 
As New York's health commissioner from 2002 to 2009, he oversaw efforts to ban smoking in public places. In 2009, President Barack Obama appointed him to head the CDC, the country's main public health agency. He stepped down in 2017.
Frieden remained in custody on Friday, Muniz said.
It was not immediately clear if he was represented by a lawyer. He was due to make an initial appearance in Brooklyn's criminal court later on Friday, the district attorney's office said.
Frieden graduated from Columbia University's medical school in 1986. After leaving government last year, Frieden became the president of Resolve to Save Lives, an effort by the non-profit health organization Vital Strategies to improve public health systems around the world that is funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

Vital Strategies did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.

TBILISI (Reuters) - A tanker with 19 crew members on board has docked at a port in Togo after going missing for over a week in a suspected hijacking off the West African coast, the crew's agency said on Friday.
The Ialkani agency and the ship's managers lost communication with the Panama-registered Pantelena on Aug. 14, when it was about 17 miles (27 km) from the port of Libreville, in Gabon.
Two Russian nationals and 17 Georgians were aboard the vessel, a dual purpose oil or chemicals tanker managed by Athens-based Lotus Shipping. The company gave no further details on the cargo or crew. 
""Our guys are alive and well. The ship is already in the port of Lome (Togo's capital) and soon representatives of our company will meet them,"" the head of Ialkani, Anzhela Oganesyan, said.
""I am almost certain that this was an attack by pirates.""
Vladimer Konstantinidu, deputy head of the Georgian foreign ministry's consulate department, said the ministry had not yet been able to communicate with the returning crew but could not rule out that the tanker had been hijacked. 
While piracy has decreased worldwide, especially off Somalia's coast, a hotbed for hijackings a decade ago, West Africa's Gulf of Guinea has become an increasing target for pirates who steal cargo and demand ransoms. 
Ships in the Gulf of Guinea were targeted by a series of pirate raids last year, according to a report by the International Maritime Bureau (IMB), which highlighted the waters off West Africa as an area of growing concern.
Ten kidnappings involving 65 crew members took place in or around Nigerian waters, the IMB said. Globally 16 vessels reported being fired upon, seven of which were in the Gulf of Guinea.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - When Pope Francis visits Dublin on Saturday, 82-year-old Irish priest James Kelly will be glued to the television waiting to hear what his old colleague makes of a new reformed Ireland.
The frail Kelly spent three years working alongside then Jorge Bergoglio when the future pope was a parish priest and college director in the Buenos Aires area in the early 1980s.
""He had a clear vision of what he wanted and he had great strength to put it into execution so he was a strong leader, great leadership capacity,"" Kelly said.
""He was a director, directing things, pushing people and so on."" 
Some people balked as the future pope's assertive style, Kelly remembers. 
""Not everyone agreed with his approach and there was opposition to him ... He was at that time authoritarian.
""I think he later changed when he was bishop of Buenos Aires. He went out and met the people, I think he changed then.""
Father Kelly will watch the two-day papal visit to Ireland on television at the Jesuit community in Dublin where he lives, a place Pope Francis knows well. 
Records at the community show that the pontiff spent 23 days there in January 1980.
At that time, contraception and divorce were still illegal in Ireland and the Catholic Church's influence on a deeply conservative society was near-total.
But Pope Francis will return to a completely different country, now led by a gay prime minister. Three years ago, it became the world's first nation to adopt gay marriage by popular ballot.
In May, it ended one of the West's strictest abortion regimes.
""Ireland has changed drastically since the last visit,"" Kelly said.

""The modern Ireland is one I have questions about myself, so I am waiting to see how he will act and how the people will react to him so I am waiting myself to find the answer to that.""

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Pope Francis faced calls on the eve of a highly-charged visit to Ireland to counter resistance within the Catholic Church against tackling clerical sex abuse, including from a member of a group advising him on the crisis.
""There is a need to change the culture in the church. If it's not changed, this is going to continue,"" Gabriel Dy-Liacco, who sits on the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, told a news conference in Dublin on Friday.
His comments were echoed by Marie Collins, an Irish abuse survivor who resigned in protest last year from the commission that Francis set up in 2014. She urged the Pope to take strong action against the perpetrators and those who protect them, including by removing top clerics if necessary.
Francis begins on Saturday the first papal visit in nearly 40 years to Ireland, a country devastated by clerical abuse, as scandals in several countries mire the Church in its worst credibility crisis in more than 15 years.
A damning report last week into abuse in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, combined with scandals in Australia and Chile, have formed what one Vatican official called ""a perfect storm"" not seen since the first abuse crisis erupted in Boston in 2002.
Dy-Liacco said bishops who have been preventing progress on the issue were coming around to accepting the need for action, but the process has been painfully slow.
A psychotherapist from the Philippines, he was speaking after a panel discussion in Dublin on safeguarding children at the Vatican's World Meeting of Families.
Vatican watchers say most of the resistance has come from some bishops, particularly older ones, who feel they would be judged by today's standards for practices that were common decades ago. These included moving predator priests to other posts or easing them out of the Church quietly to avoid public scandal.
""I think at this point the Pope really needs to face down this resistance. If it means removing people in high office, then that is what he must do,"" said Collins, who quit the commission over what she called ""shameful"" resistance within the Vatican.
""Every day children are being abused so every day that goes by and those who protect abusers are not properly dealt with, more and more children are being harmed when they don't need to be. It's time for the Pope to take strong action."" 
The Pope's plan for a special tribunal in the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith to judge bishops suspected of mishandling abuse cases or covering them up failed to get off the ground because of bureaucratic delays and legal technicalities. 
Francis instead issued an edict in 2016 tasking four Vatican departments with oversight of bishops to examine evidence and make recommendations to the pope, who could then demand their resignation. 

While some victims' groups saw the lack of a specific tribunal as a product of resistance from the Vatican's old guard, others said the procedure outlined in the edict could be more rapid than the tribunal.

746,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>",Fighters from new rebel group attack Chad soldiers at Libya border,"N'DJAMENA (Reuters) - Rebels in northern Chad attacked government forces this week at the border with Libya, the fighters and two military sources said on Friday, although the government denied an attack had taken place.
A fledgling rebel movement, the Military Command Council for the Salvation of the Republic (CCMSR), says it seeks to overthrow President Idriss Deby, as Chad faces threats from jihadists and is trying to prevent the influx of militants fleeing the Libyan conflict.
Deby has been an ally of the West in the fight against Islamist militants in West Africa.
He has faced several rebellions since coming to power in 1990 at the head of an insurrection that toppled then president Hissene Habre, but there has been relative calm since 2009. 
The CCMSR, which says it has 4,500 fighters, was founded in 2014 and fought its first battle against government forces earlier this month in the mining town of Kouri Bougoudi.
Its ranks include former rebels from the Darfur region of neighboring Sudan and former political allies of ex-president Habre, who is serving a life sentence in a Senegalese prison for war crimes and crimes against humanity. 
The CCMSR said its fighters attacked Chadian soldiers again in Kouri Bougoudi early on Tuesday morning.
""The valiant fighters ... attacked the enemy once again in the most brutal manner,"" it said in a statement. 
""Unfortunately, the enemy preferred to flee in total disarray, leaving behind sheep carcasses and other heaps of food.""
Security Minister Ahmat Mahamat Bachir denied that the rebels had attacked the army, but two Chadian military sources told Reuters that there had been fighting. Neither the CCMSR nor the sources provided any information about casualties. 
The nascent rebellion is the latest security headache for Chad which closed the border with Libya in January in the hope of barring its militants from entering. 
Chad also faces threats from groups with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State, which operate across the lawless, semi-arid Sahel band, and from Nigeria-based Boko Haram militants. 
Deby, 66, has won election five times since coming to power, often amid accusations of fraud. Parliament approved a new constitution in April that expands his powers and could allow him to stay in office until 2033.

Both Abrams, the Democratic nominee, and her rival Republican Brian Kemp, who is white and serves as Georgia's secretary of state, had urged county officials to drop the plan.
The ruling was a win for Abrams' campaign, which aims to turn out more rural black voters, some of whom would have had to travel miles to cast a ballot in Randolph County if the measure passed.
It was the latest skirmish in a long-running U.S. political fight over restrictions on voting. Some Democrats argue that restrictions on voting such as fewer polling places or requirements to show ID restrict the rights of minority voters. Some Republicans have pointed to ID rules and dropping infrequent voters from the rolls as necessary to prevent fraud.
""We are pleased African-Americans voters in Randolph County will be able to access polling stations in November,"" Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said in a phone interview. ""Too often they are faced with voter suppression tactics like this which are clearly motivated by racial animus.""
The board of elections in Randolph County, about 125 miles (200 km) south of Atlanta, voted 2-0 to block the measure, a spokesman said in a phone interview. A crowd of voting-rights advocates packed the room for their morning vote, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.
Kemp said on Twitter that the board had done ""the right thing."" Abrams did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The proposal would have closed seven of Randolph county's nine polling sides because they were not wheelchair accessible, which board members said was a violation of federal disabilities law. It was submitted by an elections consultant who had donated money to Kemp's campaign, the Journal-Constitution reported. County Attorney Tommy Coleman said officials fired him on Wednesday.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the reported donation.
Some 60 percent of the rural county's 7,100 residents are black.

""In the United States, the right to vote is sacred,"" the Randolph County Board of Elections said in a statement. ""The interest and concern shown has been overwhelming, and it is an encouraging reminder that protecting the right to vote remains a fundamental American principle.""

749,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2018 11:40AM ET</span>",'Critical worsening' of conditions for migrants detained in Libya: UNHCR,"TUNIS (Reuters) - The U.N. refugee agency said on Friday it was gravely concerned about a deterioration in conditions for migrants held in Libyan detention centers that had led to riots and hunger strikes.
Many migrants are taken to the centers after being intercepted by Libya's EU-backed coastguard as they try to reach Europe by sea, a policy that has been criticized by human rights groups.
An estimated 8,000 migrants are currently held in 18 detention centers linked to the internationally recognized government in Tripoli, according to UNHCR.
Those detained make up a small fraction of the several hundred thousand migrants resident in Libya or passing through the North African country.
Humanitarian workers have limited access to the centers, which frequently open and close. 
""In recent weeks, UNHCR has witnessed a critical worsening in conditions in detention centers, due to the increasing overcrowding and lack of basic living standards,"" the agency said in a statement. 
""As a consequence, riots and hunger strikes by refugees inside detention centers are taking place, demanding a resolution to their bleak living conditions.
""This has led to a number of serious security incidents, where UNHCR front line staff have been placed at physical risk.""
Libyan officials have blamed poor conditions at detention centers on a lack of resources, and have said migrants are detained for their own protection.
Departures of mainly sub-Saharan African migrants from Libya to Italy peaked between 2014-2017 as the country slid further into turmoil following a NATO-backed uprising seven years ago.
Last summer smuggler networks were disrupted under heavy pressure from Italy, and Libya's coastguard stepped up interceptions. 
So far this year 12,174 migrants have landed in Italy from Libya, nearly 87 percent fewer than during the same period in 2017, according to Italian interior ministry statistics.
There are nearly 55,000 refugees and asylum seekers registered in Libya, where they face limited chances of resettlement, according to UNHCR.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. sanctions against Russia tied to a nerve agent attack in Britain, which were announced earlier this month, will come into effect on Monday, the U.S. government said on Friday, adding to the array of economic penalties it has imposed on Moscow in recent years.
The new measures, detailed in a notice posted at the Federal Register, will terminate foreign assistance and some arms sales and financing to Russia, as well as deny the country credit and prohibit the export of security-sensitive goods and technology.
Russia's Foreign Ministry said the sanctions will only create more tension between the two countries, the RIA news agency reported on Friday.
Although President Donald Trump has often said he would like better ties with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, Washington's relations with Moscow are at a low - frayed by U.S. allegations Russia interfered in its 2016 presidential election, and by disagreements over Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and its role in the Syrian civil war.
Plans to impose the latest sanctions were announced by the Trump administration on Aug. 8, a response to what the State Department said was Moscow's use of a nerve agent against a former Russian agent and his daughter in Britain in March.
Sergei Skripal, a former colonel in Russia's GRU military intelligence service, and his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia, were found unconscious on a bench in the southern English city of Salisbury after a liquid form of the Novichok type of nerve agent was applied to the front door of his home. Both survived the attack.
Moscow has denied involvement in the attack. It has also denied meddling in the 2016 U.S. elections.
'CHANGE IN BEHAVIOR'
Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, said on Friday Moscow must change its ways before the United States will lift its already long list of sanctions.
""The sanctions remain in force and will remain in force until the required change in Russian behavior,"" he told a news conference in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev.
The new measures will be published and come into effect on Aug. 27 and remain in place for at least one year, according to the notice in the Federal Register, a daily catalog of government agency actions. They are authorized by the 1991 Chemical and Biological Weapons and Warfare Elimination Act. 
Space flight activities, government space cooperation, areas concerning commercial aviation safety and urgent humanitarian assistance will be exempt. 
A second batch of penalties will be imposed after 90 days unless Russia gives ""reliable assurance"" that it would no longer use chemical weapons and allow on-site inspections by the United Nations or another international observer group.

Soon after the attack on the Skripals, Washington also showed solidarity with Britain and announced it would expel 60 Russian diplomats, joining governments across Europe in punishing the Kremlin.

Merkel avoided using the term ""genocide"" in her remarks, sidestepping a possible repeat of tensions that flared with Turkish President Tayyap Erdogan after the German parliament in 2016 branded the massacre a genocide.

Merkel called the 2016 remembrance ceremony by the Bundestag an ""important step in the culture of remembrance"" but stressed that the language used was a political - not legal - classification.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - A popular Ugandan musician-turned-legislator arraigned on treason charges had breathing problems and was left partially paralyzed after beatings in detention, lawmakers who visited him said on Friday.
In an unpublished report seen by Reuters the parliamentarians said Robert Kyagulanyi had told them that he had been tortured by men in military uniforms.
The document was not published or formally tabled in parliament as the chairwoman of the committee of MPs, who visited Kyagulanyi while he was held in a military barracks, refused to sign the report, authorities said.
In its conclusion, the parliamentary report said the rights of Kyagulanyi, four other lawmakers, and nearly 30 other people arrested for their alleged roles in the stoning of a presidential motorcade had been ""blatantly violated"". 
""His left lower body was paralyzed, he spoke and breathed with difficulty often breaking to catch his breath,"" the report said. 
""The military and other errant state functionaries that are complicit in violating the law and eroding human rights and dignity should account for their action,"" it added.
Kyagulanyi walked with a crutch when he appeared in a civilian court on Thursday where he was charged with treason. The presiding magistrate granted him access to private doctors, citing the ""health of the accused"".
His arrest, along with four other politicians critical of President Yoweri Museveni, sparked two days of anti-government demonstrations in the capital Kampala and other parts of the country this week.
According to Kyagulanyi men wearing uniforms of the Special Forces Command broke into his hotel room to arrest him on Aug. 14 in the northern town of Arua, where he was campaigning for an ally in a parliamentary by-election. 
Kyagulanyi told the lawmakers that while he knelt on the floor with his hands up in surrender, the men struck him on the head with a blunt object, beat him with gun butts, and smashed one of his testicles. 
""He showed the committee some of the scars on his body"", according to the report. 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE
""I can't give a comment on a report that has not been formally presented in parliament,"" military spokesman Richard Karemire told Reuters by phone. ""That kind of report can only be responded to by our political leader who is our minister of defense.""
Government spokesman Ofwono Opondo has repeatedly denied security personnel had deliberately beaten Kyagulanyi, lawmakers or any of those detained over the presidential motorcade stoning.
On Friday he said the detained lawmakers had now been produced in court, which should put an end to ""verbal claims about torture"", he said. The added that the report had not been officially tabled ""because the chairperson disputed it"". 
Contacted by Reuters, the chairwoman of the committee of lawmakers did not immediately comment on her reasons for refusing to sign-off on the report.
Kyagulanyi, 36, entered parliament last year as an outspoken critic of Museveni's government. He has a large youth following in the East African country where unemployment is high, public services are lacking, and there is a widespread perception that corruption by officials is rampant and rarely punished. 
Opponents accuse Museveni, in power since 1986, of stifling dissent through intimidation, beatings and detentions, charges his government denies.

KIEV (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's national security adviser John Bolton said on Friday that U.S. sanctions against Russia would remain in place until Moscow changed its behavior. 
Bolton was in Kiev to show Washington's support for Ukraine which celebrated the anniversary of its independence from the Soviet Union with a military parade on Friday.
The United States has imposed sanctions against Russia to punish it for its 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea, support for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, and meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, something Moscow denies.
Critics of President Donald Trump have accused him of being soft on Russia and there is a bi-partisan push in Congress to impose more sanctions on Moscow. 
Bolton, speaking before a new round of sanctions announced by the State Department took effect, set out what he cast as a tough approach by the administration to sanctions. 
""The sanctions remain in force and will remain in force until the required change in Russian behavior,"" Bolton told a news conference after talks with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. 
""I underlined what President Trump said in Helsinki to President (Vladimir) Putin that it was the position of the United States that we did not recognize the illegal annexation of Crimea,"" he said, referring to a U.S.-Russia summit in Finland last month. 
""Our view and our policy remain as they have been.""
'MORE TENSION'
The Russian rouble has been pushed steadily lower by U.S. sanctions, the latest of which take effect on Monday, according to a notice posted on Friday in the U.S. Federal Register.
Russia's Foreign Ministry said on Friday that the new sanctions, announced earlier this month over a nerve agent attack in Britain, would only create more tension in bilateral relations, the RIA news agency reported.
In comments likely to anger Moscow, Bolton said that Kiev had made progress in its efforts to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and advised Ukraine to look for alternatives to Russian natural gas.
""A lot depends on Ukraine fulfilling the requirements necessary to meet all of the military and political tests to be a NATO member,"" Bolton said.
""I would say progress is being made but there is still more to accomplish,"" he added.
Russia strongly opposes NATO expansion towards its western borders and moved to annex Crimea in 2014 after Viktor Yanukovich, Ukraine's Russia-friendly president, was toppled in a popular revolution. 
Bolton said it was important to resolve the Ukraine crisis and that it would be dangerous to leave the situation as it was in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, where Moscow has backed separatists in their conflict with Kiev.
Ukraine stopped buying gas from Russia in November 2015 and now imports gas mostly via Slovakia. Ukrainian energy firm Naftogaz says the gas is ""European in origin."" Moscow says the gas is still Russian despite Slovakia's intermediary role.
Bolton mentioned U.S. liquefied natural gas and other possible replacements to Russian supplies. 
He said he had told Poroshenko that Moscow should not meddle in Ukraine's presidential vote next year.
""President Poroshenko and I agreed that we will look at steps that the United States and Ukraine could take to look at election meddling here,"" he said.

Addressing law enforcement officers in a video released on Thursday, Kadyrov said he would impose ""sanctions"" against rights advocates because they were ""preventing our people from living in peace"".
""They have only one goal: to do us harm,"" Kadyrov said, adding that activists would be banned from entering the region after the trial of prominent rights advocate Oyub Titiev ended. 
Activists have been visiting Chechnya to attend the trial of Titiev, who runs the office of the Memorial Human Rights Center in Chechnya.
He was arrested earlier this year on suspicion of possessing cannabis in a case critics say was fabricated and aimed at silencing him. 
When asked to comment on Kadyrov's pledge to ban activists, the Kremlin on Friday said his words may have been taken out of context. 
""Here we need of course to distinguish between different human rights activists,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call. 
""Many human rights activists serve very necessary functions and are deservedly respected."" 
Chechnya has been ruled by Kadyrov since 2004. Rights groups and Western governments allege that authorities repress political opponents, discriminate against women and persecute sexual minorities, all allegations that Chechnya's leaders deny.
Critics say Moscow has turned a blind eye to abuses in Chechnya, where it fought two wars against separatists after the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union. In return for broad autonomy and subsidies, Kadyrov's administration is loyal to Moscow. 
Memorial has angered Chechen authorities by monitoring disappearances, torture and punitive house burnings in the region.

Titiev's predecessor, Natalia Estemirova, was kidnapped and shot dead in 2009. Nobody has been convicted of her killing.

The RAF Typhoons scrambled from Mihail Kogalniceanu air base in Romania on Thursday in response to a Russian Be-12 plane which was heading southwest over the Black Sea from Crimea, the ministry said.
The Royal Air Force has deployed Typhoons to the Baltic States in recent years as part of a mission to protect NATO airspace in the region.
In the previous incident on Tuesday, it scrambled two typhoons in Romania to shadow two suspected Russian Su-30 Flanker aircraft.

Growing numbers are fleeing economic meltdown and political turmoil in Venezuela, threatening to overwhelm neighboring countries. Officials from Colombia, Ecuador and Peru will meet in Bogota next week to seek a way forward.
Ecuador and Peru have this month tightened entry rules for Venezuelans, requiring them to carry valid passports instead of just national ID cards. While in Brazil, rioters drove hundreds back over the border.
Describing those events as early warning signs, International Organization for Migration (IOM) spokesman Joel Millman said funding and means of managing the outflow must be mobilized.
""This is building to a crisis moment that we've seen in other parts of the world, particularly in the Mediterranean,"" he told a news briefing. 
On Thursday, the IOM and U.N. refugee agency UNHCR called on Latin American countries to ease entry for Venezuelans, more than 1.6 million of whom have left since 2015.
UNHCR spokesman Andrej Mahecic said on Friday that governments had made ""commendable"" efforts despite some reception capacities and services being overwhelmed.
But ""some disturbing images"" had emerged from the region in the past week. ""Those increase stigmatization of those who are forced to flee, they put at risk also the efforts for their integration,"" he said.

The public inquiry, which started on Monday and is being telecast live, is reviewing allegations that the Gupta brothers - who headed a large conglomerate in South Africa - unduly influenced Zuma regarding political appointments and the awarding of government contracts.
Zuma says the three Gupta brothers - Atul, Ajay and Rajesh - are his friends but he denies any influence-peddling in their relationship. The Guptas have also denied any wrongdoing. 
The brothers, whose whereabouts are not known, as well as their lawyers, officials from their firms and family representatives could not be reached on Friday for comment on Jonas's remarks. 
The inquiry, led by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, was set up on the recommendation of a 2016 report into alleged influence-peddling in Zuma's administration by the Public Protector, South Africa's main anti-corruption authority.
The 2016 report stopped short of asserting that crimes had been committed, but focused on allegations that the three Gupta brothers influenced the appointment of ministers.
One such allegation was that the Gupta brothers offered to secure Jonas the finance minister's job; others were that Zuma had directed state firms to award tenders to the Guptas through influence peddling.
The 2016 report and other scandals surrounding Zuma's nine-year rule forced him out of office in February.
Jonas, an outspoken critic of corruption during his time in government, told the inquiry that he met Zuma's son, Duduzane, who had asked him to attend a meeting with the Gupta brothers in October 2015.
One of the brothers told him that Zuma was going to fire Nhlanhla Nene, the finance minister, because ""he (Nene) could not work with the Guptas"". The Gupta brother then offered to make Jonas finance minister, Jonas said.
""'You must understand we are in control of everything... and the old man (Zuma) will do anything we tell him to do',"" Jonas said, quoting the Gupta brother.
The Gupta brother offered to pay Jonas 600 million rand ($41 million) to take the job as finance minister, to be deposited into an account, Jonas testified. The Gupta brother also offered to give Jonas 600,000 rand in cash stuffed in a bag, according to Jonas. 
He said he turned down the offer. ""At the end of the meeting Mr Gupta said 'We have information on you' and if I suggested the meeting had occurred, they would kill me,"" Jonas said.
Zuma fired finance minister Nhlanhla Nene in December 2015, replacing him with unknown parliamentary backbencher Des van Rooyen. Zuma was forced to sack van Rooyen and reappoint a previous finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, four days later after the rand currency plunged, reflecting market jitters.

GHAZNI, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Clashes have broken out between Taliban militants and government forces in Afghanistan forcing some civilians to flee from their homes near the city of Ghazni, which the insurgents stormed this month, officials said on Friday.
The Taliban raided three villages on the outskirts of Ghazni late on Thursday, destroying some newly built checkpoints and cutting off power to some parts of the city.
Provincial police chief Farid Mashal said government forces counter-attacked to block the insurgents from approaching the city.
""We were swift to push the Taliban out of the villages, but many civilians fled to neighboring villages fearing the fighters could kill them,"" said Mashal. He said there were no reports of casualties.
More than 1,000 Taliban fighters assaulted the city, 150 km (95 miles) southwest of Kabul, on the main road to southern Afghanistan, this month killing at least 150 soldiers and 95 civilians.
Militants roamed the city for four days, destroying communications towers and cutting power and water supplies before government forces regained control with the help of U.S. air strikes.
The government and international aid agencies have been struggling to restore services in the city over recent days.
The latest clashes came days after President Ashraf Ghani offered the Taliban a three-month ceasefire but the insurgents rejected it, two senior militant commanders said, and vowed to maintain their attacks on the government and its foreign allies.
Repeated assaults on Ghazni has exposed the fragile grip Ghani's Western-backed government has on security and its apparent inability to prevent large-scale militant attacks.
Ghani has ordered an investigation into the attacks and announced disbursement of $20 million for immediate relief and reconstruction process. 
The Taliban are fighting to expel foreign forces, defeat the government and impose their version of Islamist rule.
Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said on Friday the militants had not given up any ground during recent clashes.
""Even more areas have been liberated from the grip of occupation,"" he said in a statement.

761,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2018 09:00AM ET</span>","Eyeing election, Indian opposition leader sets out small business focus","By William James
LONDON (Reuters) - Rahul Gandhi, leader of India's opposition Congress party, said he would seek to shift the focus of the country's economic policy towards supporting small and medium-sized firms if he won power at an upcoming election.
The fourth-generation politician of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty spoke to reporters and academics in London, criticizing Prime Minister Narendra Modi for concentrating economic support on big companies at the expense of job-creating smaller enterprises.
Speaking ahead of an election due early next year, Gandhi used a broad question and answer session covering foreign policy toward neighbors China and Pakistan and even Brexit, to sketch out his approach to defeating the Hindu nationalist Modi.
""Of course we have to support the large industries, but the focus has to shift to developing small and medium businesses,"" he said at the International Institute of Strategic Studies.
The centrist Congress party has been critical of the Modi government's job creation record, and Gandhi said the solution to the unemployment problem was a shift away from what he called Modi's focus on ""large industrialists"". 
""You're not going to get the jobs from there,"" Gandhi said.
""You are going to get jobs from small and medium businesses, you are going to get jobs from a transformation of agriculture, you are going to get jobs from construction, you are going to get from building housing.""
He said the party could also consider ""strategic plays"" such as opening up the air travel sector like China has done.
Modi's inability to generate tens of millions of jobs for the country's youth - a promise which helped him secure the largest mandate in three decades in 2014 - would be the biggest threat to his bid for another term in the general election due by May, political analysts have said.
The government told parliament in July that creating jobs was a priority. The labor ministry said it was ""encouraging"" the private sector, fast-tracking various projects involving substantial investments, and increasing public spending on various state-run employment-generation programs.
Opinion polls show Modi remains the front runner to win another five-year term, but his Bharatiya Janata Party has suffered reverses in some local elections in the past few months that have energized the opposition.
BALANCING ROLE
On foreign policy, Gandhi said India was uniquely positioned to act as a balance between the West and China, defusing tensions that have emerged during Beijing's ascent to economic superpower status. 
""India can play a balancing role - India has some of the design elements, some of the ideas that can bring people together and build a bridge,"" he said. 
""We specialize in reducing confrontations.""
He was less optimistic about the prospect of renewing relations with neighboring Pakistan after its new Prime Minister Imran Khan offered an olive branch to India by proposing talks to resolve a long-standing dispute over Kashmir.
""Pakistan ... is a number of institutions, so the difficulty from an Indian perspective is which institution do you talk to? Some of those institutions are hostile to India,"" Gandhi said.
""I don't think you can pull a solution out before the solution is ready, and I don't think that solution is ready.""

762,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2018 08:47AM ET</span>",Reuters journalists face verdict next week on Myanmar secrets charges,"By Aye Min Thant and Poppy McPherson
YANGON (Reuters) - The judge in the trial of two Reuters reporters jailed in Myanmar on accusations of obtaining secret state documents said on Monday he will deliver his verdict on Aug. 27, in a case seen as a test of press freedom in the fledgling democracy.
The judge set the date after hearing closing arguments from both sides, during which lawyers for the two journalists said they had been ""trapped"" by police in an effort to interfere with their reporting of a massacre of Rohingya Muslims.
""The duty of the reporter is to reveal the truth,"" said lead defense lawyer Khin Maung Zaw. ""Some people may not be okay with that truth.""
Khin Maung Zaw said the prosecution had failed to establish that the documents at the heart of the case were sought out by the reporters or that they were a threat to national security, crucial components of the case against them.
The court in Yangon has been holding hearings since January to decide whether, Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, are guilty of breaching the colonial-era Official Secrets Act, which carries a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison.
At the time of their arrest last year, the two reporters were working on a Reuters investigation into the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men and boys in a village in western Myanmar's Rakhine state, during an army crackdown that United Nations' agencies say sent some 700,000 Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh.
Lead prosecutor Kyaw Min Aung outlined the state's case against Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, whose actions, he said, showed they ""intended to harm"" the country. By acquiring documents that could pose a threat to the state if their contents were obtained by extremist groups, he said, the pair were working for the benefit of Reuters rather than for the national interest.
""Reuters is a foreign news agency that pays its reporters in dollars,"" he said. ""It was found from the reporters that they sent their news to Reuters and their own evidence shows that Reuters sells news for money.""
Defense lawyer Khin Maung Zaw said it was obvious Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were reporters and the court had heard no testimony to suggest they were spies.
""The government has not designated Reuters an enemy of the nation,"" he added.
Government spokesman Zaw Htay could not be reached for comment on Monday. He has mostly declined to comment throughout the proceedings, saying Myanmar's courts are independent. 
Reuters said in a statement there was no basis for a conviction and that it looked forward to the reporters' acquittal, which it said would be an important step towards demonstrating Myanmar's commitment to the rule of law, freedom of the press, and democracy.
""The evidence before the court is clear: Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo are two honest reporters who did not commit a crime,"" said the new agency in the statement. ""Imprisoning them for even one more day would be unlawful retribution for their truthful and important journalism.""
""BABY GIRL""
Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo have told the court they were entrapped by police officials who planted documents on them shortly before their arrest on Dec. 12. They say Police Lance Corporal Naing Lin and another officer handed them the documents in a rolled-up newspaper at a Yangon restaurant. 
A police captain, Moe Yan Naing, testified that a superior officer had instructed his subordinates, including Naing Lin, to ""trap"" the reporters. Naing Lin has told the court he met the reporters, but denied giving them anything.
The reporters have said they were hooded, handcuffed, and deprived of sleep during days of interrogation.
The case has captured global attention and has come to be seen as a test of press freedom and reforms in Myanmar, where the military still wields considerable influence. Senior U.N officials, Western nations and press freedom advocates have called for the release of the two journalists. The courtroom on Monday was filled with foreign diplomats and observers.
Wa Lone's wife, Pan Ei Mon, who earlier this month gave birth to the couple's first child, was not present. After the hearing, Kyaw Soe Oo's wife, Chit Su Win, carried their three-year-old daughter out of the court as she sobbed ""papa"". 
Speaking to reporters, Wa Lone said he hoped the court would rule in their favor. 

""We firmly believe that the court will make a fair decision and will free us,"" he said. ""I firmly believe that, before long, I will be able to return to my baby girl.""

BISIL, Kenya (Reuters) - Thousands of Kenyan boys had a blessing of milk and beer sprayed on them as part of a rare Maasai ethnic community initiation ceremony to mark their passing into early manhood.
The colorful event, in Kajiado County, in the country's Great Rift Valley, happens just once every five to ten years for boys aged between nine and 15. In the Maasai tradition, a boy's ""age set"" is a critical. 
After spending the previous night in dry, scrub brush forest, the boys were given a heroes welcome with multiple rounds of singing and chanting to boost their morale as they danced thrusting sticks in the air.
All the boys painted their heads with ochre, a deep red pigment made from clay. Those initiates chosen to be future leaders of the age group were marked by elaborate white paint patterns on their faces and bodies. 
Their torsos were draped with colorful beads matching their bracelets. The young men also wore traditional red blankets and black sandals made out of tires. 
""The ceremony is called 'Il Mirisho' which means people who have won...(within) five years they all will be circumcised and recognized as a moran,"" said community elder Ole Sakaya Matini.
Traditionally, moran are the Maasai's warrior class made up of brave and strong young men who defend the community.
The ceremony was organized by elders from the Matapato area where the boys are from.
To mark the occasion, a large bull was sacrificed and its meat was roasted and feed thousands of attendants. Its organs were later used to offer ritual blessings. 
Elders put rings made out of the bull's leather on the fingers of the boys, who were also smeared with oil. In the last part of the ceremony, elders sprayed the milk-beer combination onto the boys as another blessing. 
""This is the first ceremony to give their age group a name, now they are recognized and have an identity as an age group,"" said Matini, the elder.

The name chosen for this group, he said, is ""Ilmemiri"" -- meaning ""people who have won"", or ""people who cannot be defeated"".

Critics call the ""Valley of the Fallen"" site, marked by a 152 meter-high cross on a mountainside near Madrid, the only remaining monument to a fascist leader in Europe.
The decree reduces the risk of legal claims preventing the exhumation of Franco's remains, including by his descendants. During his rule, from the end of the civil war in 1939 to his death in 1975, tens of thousands were killed or imprisoned in a campaign to wipe out dissent. 
The measure needs to be approved by the rest of parliament, where Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez holds only a quarter of seats, but it is unlikely to be voted down.
""Only the mortal remains of people who died as a result of the Spanish Civil War will lie in the Valley of the Fallen,"" deputy prime minister Carmen Calvo told a news conference.

The legislative process to turn the monument into ""a place of commemoration, remembrance and homage to the victims of the war"" should be finished by the end of the year, Calvo said.

The move aims to help soldiers eat more healthily and mitigate the impacts of meat production that contribute to global warming, the army said.
But Finland's defense minister, Jussi Niinisto, from the nationalist Blue Reform party, said he was perplexed by the decision, of which he had not been informed in advance.

Finland, which shares a 1,340km (833 miles) border and a difficult history with Russia, has compulsory military service of up to a year for all men.
Niinisto said he would ask the defense forces to produce a report explaining how the decision was made. The army did not respond to requests for further comment.
The defense minister's Blue Reform group remained in the country's center-right government after it splintered off from the anti-immigrant Finns party that was kicked out of the coalition last year.
Many Finnish schools have a weekly vegetarian day and the military said it has continuously increased the share of vegetarian options on the menu is mess halls.

The 44-year old ethnic Chinese Buddhist woman, named Meiliana, was found guilty and sentenced to 18 months in prison by a court in Medan on Sumatra island earlier this week.
Senior members of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), a moderate Islamic organization that boasts over 40 million members across the country, added their voice to a chorus of criticism denouncing the verdict.
""Saying the volume of the call to prayer is too loud, in my opinion, is not blasphemy,"" said Robikin Emhas, head of the NU's legal division.
""As Muslims, such opinions should be received as constructive criticism in a pluralistic society,"" he added. 
Amnesty International has described it as ""ludicrous"", and an online petition calling for the woman's release had received nearly 100,000 signatures by Friday.
Indonesia has the world's largest population of Muslims, and sizable Buddhist, Christian and other religious minorities, but the propagation of conservative and hardline interpretations of Islam in recent years has fanned fears that the secular nation is becoming less tolerant.
Last year, Jakarta's ex-governor, an ethnic Chinese Christian, was tried and jailed for blasphemy after several Muslim groups accused him of insulting Islam when he said his political rivals were using the Koran to deceive voters. 
When asked if President Joko Widodo would intervene on Meiliana's behalf, his spokesman Johan Budi said the president does not get involved in judicial matters.
Meiliana's lawyers will appeal against the jail sentence.
They maintain that she had made remarks in a private conversation in 2016 on the volume of mosque loudspeakers. Those remarks were twisted to appear like she was objecting to the call to prayer itself and repeated in the community and on social media, her legal team said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post.
There are hundreds of thousands of mosques across the vast Indonesian archipelago and most use loudspeakers to play the 'azan' or call to prayer, which lasts a few minutes.
But many also play lengthy versions of prayers or sermons lasting over 30 minutes, which the Indonesian Mosque Council has deemed unnecessary.

CHELELEKTU, Ethiopia (Reuters) - Shiburu Kutuyu, a 45-year-old Ethiopian maize and coffee farmer, was jolted awake by gunshots one night in June. He told his wife and seven children to flee. 
They returned to find their mud-walled home had been burned down, but no sign of Shiburu. Eleven days later, fellow farmers found his body hanging from a tree, his severed limbs strewn on the ground.
""A mob of Oromo youths killed him in the most gruesome manner,"" Shiburu's brother-in-law Mulugeta Samuel told Reuters from one of the dozens of camps in southern Ethiopia filled with people who fled violence between two ethnic groups: the Oromo and the Gedeo.
A surge in ethnic violence, sometimes in the form of mob attacks, has displaced nearly 1 million people in the past four months in southern Ethiopia and is inflaming bad feeling between ethnic groups in other regions. 
The violence threatens to undermine Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's calls for unity in one of Africa's most ethnically diverse countries. It also overshadows the popular liberal measures he has announced since coming to power in April. 
Some observers say young men from Abiy's ethnic group, the Oromo, have been emboldened by his rise and are attacking other groups in revenge for years of marginalization.
Ethiopia's security apparatus is in a state of flux since Abiy announced reform plans, said Asnake Kefale, an assistant professor of politics at Addis Ababa University. ""Some individuals have taken advantage of this state of affairs,"" he said.
On Thursday, Sorri Dinka, spokesman for the Oromiya Police Commission, said authorities are taking action against individuals suspected of ethnically motivated crimes.
He mentioned the so-called ""qeerroo"", a term used to describe young Oromo men involved in the protest movement over the past three years that culminated in former Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn's resignation.
Some people who fled their homes still feel federal government and local authorities are failing to halt violence against them.
Tihun Negatu escaped an attack on her village in June. She and her two children have been living in a school converted into a shelter, wearing the clothes they fled in. 
    ""The government is not willing to bring them to justice,"" she said of the Oromo men who chased her farming community off its land, and burned down her home and a bar she ran.
The government denies turning a blind eye. Federal disaster management chief Mitiku Kassa said a committee of ministers and regional officials has been formed to oversee rehabilitation and reconciliation efforts.
He told Reuters nearly 400 people in Oromiya have been arrested on suspicion of inciting violence between Gedeos and Oromos. ""If not stopped altogether, such incidents are very dangerous for the country as they may spread,"" he said.
The government has urged elders in both communities to seek reconciliation. Townhall meetings have been taking place regularly though they have not halted the violence. 
Officials in camps visited by Reuters last week said about five children die every day due to illness and hunger. 
    Plans to return displaced populations to their home areas triggered protests this month by people who said their safety was not guaranteed. 
CHANGES
One of Abiy's boldest moves has been to loosen the grip of a state that had ruled with an iron fist. He has said security forces must be reined in, emergency rule has been lifted and thousands of political prisoners released. 
Abiy, 42, rode the wave of anti-government unrest that originated in his Oromiya region. He was appointed by the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) as it sought to ease ethnic tensions and appeal to disaffected youth.
    The sweeping changes, however, have lifted the lid on historic conflicts over land, resources and local power. Underlying ethnic divides have also flared.
The Gedeo who have lived as minorities in modern-day Oromiya for generations say that although they have been subjected to violence by Oromos in the past, the worst attacks began a day after Abiy took office.
Since then, Abiy has toured Ethiopia extensively, but not visited the areas where the Gedeo and Oromo have been fighting. 
He says unspecified ""forces with the goal of undermining peace and unity"" are to blame for the violence. But some critics say he has avoided tackling the issue head on for fear of alienating his Oromo base. 
""It is difficult for the people to rely on your rhetoric unless you practically toil to bring lasting peace for all Ethiopians irrespective of their ethnic or religious background,"" a diaspora group of Gedeos wrote recently in an open letter to Abiy.
In a statement this week he acknowledged the mob nature of some of the violence: ""Changes have ... brought mob justice, fueled by some segments of the youth in some areas, undermining rule of law.""
The prime minister, who has a doctorate in conflict resolution, has enjoyed wide support since coming to office. Stickers bearing his face are plastered on many vehicles in Addis Ababa and other cities. 
    ""He will not want to rock that boat,"" said a Western diplomat in Addis Ababa, referring to the positive response Abiy has received since taking office after three years of street protests in which security forces killed hundreds of people.
""But he risks further destabilization if he does not lay down the law."" 
RISKS
The violence in southern Ethiopia is one of several ethnic-based disputes nationwide.
Tens of thousands remain displaced by violence along the border between the Oromiya and Somali regions. Oromos accuse a local Somali paramilitary force of atrocities. 
This month, mobs looted properties owned by minorities in the Somali region's capital Jijiga. The federal government said unrest had been stoked by regional officials who had fallen out with authorities in Addis Ababa.
Other incidents, though isolated, show the risks of mob retaliation.
Earlier this month a man was lynched and left hanging upside down in a public square in the Oromiya town of Shashemene by a mob who wrongly suspected he was carrying a bomb. Police stood by idly, according to an eyewitness.
    In June in the southern city of Hawassa, several men from the Wolayta ethnic group were burned alive by members of the rival Sidama ethnic group. According to witnesses interviewed by Reuters, the men were targeted in a push by Sidamas to form their own region. 
    The violence raises questions about the structure of the state: a federal republic where regional boundaries were redrawn on ethnic lines in 1994.
    Seizing power after a long guerrilla war, the EPRDF said the arrangement it would empower marginalized ethnic groups after centuries of domination by Amharas.
    Critics say it has eroded national unity.

    ""The ethnicized nature of our politics has emphasized our differences for the last 27 years,"" said opposition politician Lidetu Ayalew. ""We have to find a way out of this if this country is to remain intact.""

769,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2018 07:20AM ET</span>","South Korea sends sanctioned material to North Korea, politician says","By Joyce Lee and Jeongmin Kim
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea has sent 1 billion won ($893,239.96) worth of sanctioned material to North Korea, customs data showed on Friday, raising concern ties with the United States could be damaged as the South pursues cooperation with the North.
The United States is pressing North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program, calling for stringent implementation of tough U.S. and U.N. sanctions.
But at the same time, its ally, South Korea, is trying to increase cooperation with its old rival.
South Korea transferred about 113 tonnes of materials and equipment including steel, copper, nickel and water heaters to North Korea in June and July, according to customs data released by opposition lawmaker Cheong Yang-seog. 
The material and equipment identified in the data are banned from being exported to North Korea under U.N. Security Council Resolution 2397, Cheong's office said.
The Korea Customs Service declined to comment on the data, directing inquiries to another ministry that handles inter-Korean relations. It also declined to comment.
A South Korean foreign ministry official also declined to comment on the customs data, but said materials and equipment are being sent for a liaison office that South Korea is building just over the border in North Korea, as part of efforts championed by the South's President Moon Jae-in to improve ties.
""All the material, equipment and electricity are for the office's operation and to ensure the convenience of our personnel,"" said the ministry official.
""It does not give any economic gain to North Korea, so we are concluding that it does not damage the objective of the sanctions.""
Moon is committed to securing diplomatic progress with North Korea, in part by opening this year the office in Kaesong, on the North Korea side of the border. 
Cheong was not available for comment but he has been raising objections to the lack of information on the amount of money the government has been spending on the liaison office.
He and other opposition politicians have raised concern that the transfer of material for the office could violate U.N. and U.S. sanctions against North Korea. 
Last month, South Korea's customs agency said three South Korean firms imported coal from North Korea disguised as Russian products in violation of U.N. resolutions. 
Shin Beom-chul, senior fellow at Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul, said such sanctions busting, together with South Korea's push to expand ties with the North, could exacerbate friction with the United States on how to handle North Korea. 
""If we go on like this the gap of disagreement will widen, and can become a more serious issue,"" Shin said.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed in broad terms to work toward denuclearization of the Korean peninsula in a historic summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in June.
But there has been no indication that North Korea had stopped its nuclear activities, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a report on Monday. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is set to visit North Korea next week.

GENEVA (Reuters) - A doctor has become the first probable Ebola case in one of the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo's ""high insecurity zones"" which are dogged by militia violence and hard to access, a scenario ""we have all been dreading"", the WHO said on Friday.
Since the outbreak erupted on Aug. 1, 103 confirmed and probable cases of Ebola have been identified in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, including 63 deaths, the health ministry said in an overnight update.
The doctor living in Oicha town in North Kivu has been re-hospitalised with Ebola symptoms after his wife was confirmed as having the disease when she traveled to the nearby city of Beni, Dr. Peter Salama, the World Health Organization's head of emergency operations, said. 
Oicha is almost entirely surrounded by ADF Ugandan Islamist militia, there are ""extremely serious security concerns"", he said. Aid workers, priests and government officials are held hostage in the area, he said. 
The doctor's initial test for Ebola - which causes vomiting, fever and diarrhoea - had been negative, but fresh results are awaited, Salama told Reuters.
So far 97 of the doctor's contacts who may have been exposed to the virus have been identified, and vaccination has begun in the town, he added. 
""So for the first time really we have a confirmed case and contacts in an area of very high insecurity. It really was the problem we were anticipating and the problem at same time that we were dreading,"" Salama told a news briefing.
WHO and health experts reached Oicha with armed escort by MONUSCO troops this week, he said, adding: ""We know from that incident now in Oicha we are going to have to operate in some very complex environments due to security and access concerns.""
In a further worrying development, angry youth burned down a health centre in another village, where vaccinations were under way, after learning of a death from Ebola, Salama said.
More than 2,900 people have been vaccinated against Ebola since the outbreak began, he said.
""We are at quite a pivotal moment in this outbreak in terms of the evolution of the outbreak epidemiologically and in terms of the response,"" he said.

Idlib is a refuge for civilians and rebels displaced from other areas of Syria as well as for powerful jihadist forces. It has been hit by a wave of air strikes and shelling this month in a possible prelude to a full-scale government offensive.
Turkey has backed some rebel groups in the region and set up a dozen military observation posts. It is trying to avert an attack by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who is backed by Moscow.
""A military solution here would be a disaster, not just for the Idlib region, but a disaster in terms of Syria's future,"" Mevlut Cavusoglu told a news conference in Moscow with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov.
The two ministers met in Ankara 10 days ago and Cavusoglu then gave a similar message, saying it would be a ""massacre"" to bomb Idlib, even though there are militants there.
""Where will some 3.5 million civilians go to?"" Cavusoglu said on Friday.
""It is important for all of us to neutralize these radical groups,"" he said. ""But we have to distinguish the civilians from the terrorist groups.""
Idlib is controlled by an array of insurgent groups, with Sunni Muslim jihadists believed to be the dominant force there.
Lavrov told the same news conference that tens of thousands of militants were trying to obstruct Turkey's efforts to separate them from more moderate forces.
He said further talks on Idlib would take place in Moscow later on Friday involving the two countries' defense ministers and intelligence services. 

Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to hold talks with Cavusoglu later on Friday.

SHENZHEN, China/BEIJING (Reuters) - Police in riot gear stormed an apartment in southern China on Friday where about 40 student activists and others supporting factory workers seeking to form a labor union were staying, according to activists who said they received a video of the raid as it was taking place.
The video footage, which was shared with Reuters, showed police armed with shields and helmets bursting into the activists' accommodation and scuffling with the occupants. 
The footage appeared to show an apartment where the students were staying in Huizhou, near the southern city of Shenzhen, that had been previously visited by Reuters. The video could not be independently verified.
It was not immediately clear what happened to the activists. Calls to police in the area and five activists who had been staying at the apartment went unanswered. Labor activists in other parts of the country who are following the case and had been in touch with various activists on the scene said they were unable to contact them.
The raid is the latest step by the Chinese authorities to clamp down on a growing labor movement in the southern province of Guangdong that started brewing last month when workers at a welding machinery company, Jasic International, were fired when they tried to create a union.
Labor activism is viewed as a challenge by the ruling Communist Party, which opposes independent unions and punishes protesters.
On July 27, police detained 29 people, including laid-off workers, their families and supporters. Fourteen people remain in detention.
Since then, support has poured in, with about 50 labor activists, most of them students, traveling to Guangdong to back the workers.
An activist who shared the footage of the raid with Reuters said the raid Friday took place just after 5 a.m. The activist, who declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the footage, said the images were received directly from students in the room when the police entered.
GROWING PRESSURE
Pressure had been mounting on the activists.
In interviews with Reuters a day before the raid, 15 activists involved in the Jasic case described a multi-pronged effort to force them to disengage from the workers' cause.
The authorities have flown many of the young activists' parents to Guangdong and put them up in hotels to undergo ""training sessions"" about how to raise their children, according to interviews with several students.
Authorities lectured the parents on text messages to send to their children. They also arranged to have parents show up at various places where their children were, including the apartment and shopping areas where protests have been staged, they said. 
The Ministry of Education issued a notice five days ago to universities across the country telling them to stop students from traveling to Guangdong to participate in the protests, according to screenshots of messages sent by universities to students.
The universities gave a range of explanations to students about why it was unsafe for them to go to Guangdong including an approaching typhoon and the risk of being recruited into a pyramid scheme, several students said. 
Reuters was unable to verify the order and the ministry did not respond to faxed questions.
The hashtag ""what's up with Guangdong?"" started trending on Weibo as the Ministry of Education notice spread.
Several of the students' university advisers had apparently also flown to Guangdong to try to persuade them to leave, according to some of the activists.

The protests have spread to Beijing where, on Wednesday and Thursday, a group of 20 students, activists and two worker representatives from Jasic submitted petition letters at the headquarters of the All-China Federations of Trade Unions and the All-China Women's Federation.

774,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2018 06:30AM ET</span>",Court gives Malaysia nod to sell superyacht seized in 1MDB probe,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - A Malaysian court on Friday granted an application by the government to sell a $250 million luxury yacht allegedly bought with money stolen from scandal-tainted state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).
The Cayman Islands-flagged Equanimity was handed over to Malaysia by Indonesian authorities earlier this month after it was impounded in Bali.
The 300-ft (91-m) yacht was allegedly bought by fugitive Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho, or Jho Low, with funds diverted from 1MDB, according to lawsuits filed by the U.S. Department of Justice as part of a kleptocracy investigation that traced billions of dollars taken from the fund.
Malaysian police filed criminal charges against Low on Friday although his whereabouts are still unknown.
Low is regarded as having been close to former prime minister Najib Razak, who last month was charged for money laundering and abuse of power in connection with funds transferred from a former unit of 1MDB. 
The Admiralty Court in Kuala Lumpur gave the government clearance to sell the Equanimity after a one-and-a-half hour hearing, without the presence of representatives from the yacht's owner.
""It doesn't affect the case, if they're interested, they should come before this court,"" said Ong Chee Kwan, one of the lawyers representing the Malaysian government and 1MDB.
""We have not been approached by anybody, no lawyers have entered an appearance in court."" 
Before the hearing, Equanimity (Cayman) Ltd, which claims ownership of the yacht, said in a statement that it had not received any ""legally valid notice"" of the application for the sale or of the court hearing.
""To move for a sale in Malaysia immediately would be a remarkable violation of due process and international legal comity, and would call into question the actual ownership of the yacht for a potential buyer,"" the company said in the statement.
A spokesman for Low issued a statement through attorneys describing the planned sale of the yacht as further proof that Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad had no interest in following a fair and just legal process.
""This illegal and costly act once again shows Mahathir’s interests are purely political and that he has no respect for the rule of law,"" the statement said.
Once valuers have appraised the yacht, the government will put it up for sale by public tender, and the proceeds would be held by the court until it is determined who should receive the money, the government's lawyers said.
The Equanimity has an interior clad in marble and gold leaf, a spa and sauna, a 20-metre (66-ft) swimming pool, a movie theater, a lift and a helipad, according to yachtcharterfleet.com, a website for luxury charters. 

""Because the costs of maintaining it is so high, the longer it is maintained at this cost the more the value of the vessel is diminished, so we want to get it sold as soon as possible,"" Ong said.

HONOLULU (Reuters) - Hurricane Lane, a powerful Category 3 storm, lashed Hawaii on Thursday with high winds and torrential rain, causing flash floods, landslides and raging surf as residents hunkered down to ride out the storm.
The storm spun in the Pacific Ocean about 165 miles (260 km) southwest of Kailua-Kona and nearly 20 inches (51 cm) of rain had fallen on the eastern side of the Big Island of Hawaii, the National Weather Service (NWS) said.
""There's lots and lots of rain, torrential rain, with a lot of moisture in the atmosphere,"" NWS meteorologist Chevy Chevalier said, noting there were reports of 50 miles per hour (80 km/h) wind gusts. ""We're in it now.""
There were no reports of injuries, but roads were closed because of flash floods and landslides in the Pacific island state. Tourists were advised to stay away from a popular attraction on the island of Maui called the Seven Sacred Pools, a scenic cluster of waterfalls and grottos.
""Life threatening flash floods. This is a very dangerous situation. Avoid unnecessary travel,"" Governor David Ige said on Twitter.
Evacuations were underway on parts of Molokai and Maui islands while power outages were being reported on social media. 
The latest predictions showed the eye of the storm twisting west of the Big Island on Friday morning before glancing past Maui and several other islands later in the day on its way to Oahu. But authorities warned the islands could still expect to be hit hard.
Lane shifted from heading northwest and was headed north at 6 miles per hour as the Category 3 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale was packing winds of 120 mph (195 kph), the service said in an evening advisory. 
""We're telling everybody to take the storm seriously, make your final preparations, and be prepared to ride out what is going to be a prolonged rain event,"" said Andrew Pereira, communications director for the city and county of the state capital Honolulu.
REMEMBERING INIKI
The National Hurricane Center warned storm surges could raise water levels 3 to 5 feet (1 to 1.5 meters) above normal along the western shores of the Big Island and that extreme rainfall could mean ""numerous evacuations and rescues."" 
Ige has urged residents to set aside a 14-day supply of water, food and medicine. All public schools, University of Hawaii campuses and non-essential government offices on the islands of Oahu and Kauai were closed at least through Friday.
""We are in our room at Alohilani Resort waiting for Hurricane Lane to arrive,"" said Janina Ballali on Twitter. ""Hopefully, the hurricane will have mercy with our beloved Oahu.""
Par Pacific Holdings Inc said it had shut its 93,500 barrel-per-day refinery in Kapolei due to the storm.
In Hanalei on Kauai, rain fell Thursday as residents and businesses prepared for the hurricane while tourists continued to shop and dine in places that were still open.
Dave Stewart, owner of Kayak Hanalei, had boarded up the windows on his shop by mid-afternoon and moved the company's rental kayaks to high ground. 
He said he wasn't taking any chances, having lived through severe flooding on Kauai's North Shore in April and through Hurricane Iniki in 1992.
""That was total destruction,"" he said of Iniki. ""Seven out of 10 telephone poles were down, so even if your house was OK, you couldn't get out.""
Iniki was the most powerful hurricane on record to hit Hawaii, making landfall on Kauai island on Sept. 11, 1992, as a Category 4. It killed six people and damaged or destroyed more than 14,000 homes.
The shelves of a downtown Honolulu Walmart (NYSE:WMT) were stripped of items ranging from canned tuna to dog food, bottled water and coolers full of ice. 
Video footage showed whipping palm trees and darkening skies in Maui. In the Manoa Valley neighborhood in Honolulu, sidewalks typically full of joggers and dog walkers were empty as residents stood outside their homes watching the skies and businesses closed early for the day. 
President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for Hawaii and ordered federal authorities to help supplement state and local responses, the White House said on Thursday.
The Coast Guard has ordered all harbors to close to incoming vessels and the U.S. Navy moved most of its fleet out of Pearl Harbor, where ships could provide aid after the storm.
Since Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico last year, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has made changes to how it works, FEMA Administrator Brock Long said at a briefing in Washington, making sure generators are in place so they can provide power to residents and quickly restart the water system.

""It's not just providing food and water. If you fix the power first, you solve 90 percent of the problems,"" he said.

Attempts to fight the fire were complicated by the presence of the ammunition thought to date from the Soviet Army's activities in former East Germany.
The blaze, about 50 km (30 miles) southeast of Berlin, spread rapidly overnight to cover an area the size of 500 football fields, aided by the parched conditions after one of Europe's hottest summers in living memory.
""I have huge respect for the firefighters who are out there right now, risking their lives. We know there is ammunition lying around in the forest,"" said local politician Guenther Baaske, adding that some explosions had been heard.
The summer has seen forest fires across much of eastern Germany, but this blaze, so close to its largest city, led authorities to activate emergency alert systems in the early hours of Friday telling Berliners to shut their windows.
Helicopters dropped water on flames near the village of Treuenbrietzen and a Reuters photographer saw firefighters spraying water in a blackened landscape thick with smoke.
Flames came within 100 meters of houses in some places. Authorities said 540 people had to leave their homes, with many forced into emergency accommodation.

In many places flames reached as high as the forest canopy in the ordinarily swampy, heavily-wooded region that surrounds Berlin.

780,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2018 04:50AM ET</span>",New Australian PM promises stability after decade of 'revolving door' leadership,"By Colin Packham
CANBERRA (Reuters) - Incoming Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison promised generational change in the warring Liberal party on Friday, seeking to end an internecine battle that has scarred the conservative government ahead of an election due by May 2019.
Morrison, who was treasurer under outgoing prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, emerged the surprise winner in a three-way challenge for the leadership of the Liberal party brought on by a right-wing rival this week.
""Our job ... as we take forward this mantle of leadership as a new generation, is to ensure that we not only bring our party back together, which has been bruised and battered this week, but that ... we bring the parliament back together,"" Morrison said in his first appearance after his party-room victory.
""The new generation of Liberal leadership is on your side"", he told Australian voters, many of whom are angry and frustrated with a decade of political instability in which no sitting prime minister has lasted a full term. 
Morrison will be Australia's sixth prime minister in less than 10 years when he is sworn in around 6 p.m. (0800 GMT) on Friday. He ruled out calling an election in the near term but will still face an early electoral test.
Outgoing prime minister Turnbull is set to resign from parliament, forcing a by-election in his blue-ribbon Sydney seat that could risk the government's one-seat majority.
Turnbull blamed his demise on ""vengeance, personal ambition, factional feuding"" in his party, led by conservative lawmakers including former prime minister Tony Abbott, the man he toppled in a party-room coup in September 2015.
""Australians will be dumbstruck and so appalled at the conduct of the past week,"" said Turnbull. 
Liberal party member Warren Enserch said after the leadership vote: ""This revolving door of prime ministers has got to stop"".
The Liberal party is the senior partner in the Liberal-National coalition government that has consistently trailed opposition Labor in opinion polls in recent months. Bookmakers on Friday had Labor a favorite to win the next poll.
BREAK FROM THE PAST
Morrison's victory marks the chance for a break from a decade of leadership clashes between Turnbull and Abbott in both government and opposition, but ideological divisions in the party over issues such as climate change, energy policy, immigration and even globalization remain stark. 
Indeed, after Foreign Minister Julie Bishop was eliminated after the first round of the leadership ballot, Morrison only defeated Peter Dutton, his more conservative rival, by 45 votes to 40. Three changed votes would have altered the result. 
Dutton was at the center of the political turmoil this week. Seeking to head off his push for the top job, Turnbull unexpectedly called a leadership vote at a Liberal party meeting on Tuesday and won 48 to 35.
The victory margin was seen as unconvincing and Dutton and his influential supporters regrouped and pressed for a second vote, and seemed to be building momentum. Morrison emerged on Thursday as a candidate and quickly won favor with moderates.
While originally from the conservative wing of the Liberal party, Morrison is widely seen as a centrist and has rejected prominent right-wing policies, including limits on immigration. 
""He is the compromise candidate, a bridge between the conservative and moderate wings of the party,"" said Haydon Manning, a political science professor at Flinders University in South Australia state.
""He can heal the wounds that threatened to fracture the coalition government and allow the government time to prepare for an election,"" he said. 
But Morrison faces a series of policy decisions that could reopen old wounds within the government, including an impasse on energy, a topic that acted as a catalyst in Turnbull's demise.
Turnbull this week sought to placate conservative anger by stripping requirements for reducing greenhouse emissions from his centerpiece energy policy but the influential right-wing government lawmakers remain opposed to the policy.
Morrison will therefore need to find a way to meet Australia's commitment to reduce emissions by 26 percent from 2005 levels by 2030 under the Paris accord without stoking old divisions, a challenge Turnbull said would be difficult.
""The truth is that the coalition finds it very hard to get agreement on anything to do with emissions,"" said Turnbull.
FINANCIAL MARKETS COMFORTED
Morrison's victory was welcomed by financial markets, which have been shaken by the political instability. Australian shares edged higher on Friday, rebounding after three days of losses that saw the benchmark fall 1.5 percent.
""PM Morrison is the most market-friendly option,"" said Annette Beacher, Chief Asia-Pac Macro Strategist at TD Securities in Singapore.
However, Beacher said markets would be looking to see whether Morrison can narrow the gap with opposition Labor.
""The skew toward the Labor party at this stage ensures they will form government at the next election,"" she said.
It was also hoped Morrison would end the political instability that has plagued Australia.

""The political turmoil of the past decade has come at the cost of our global competitiveness ... the business community needs policy certainty to promote investment and improve business confidence."" said Tony Johnson, chief executive officer of Ernest & Young.

VIERECK, Germany (Reuters) - When Marlon finished high school in Germany, a military career seemed far more appealing than working on a car production line.
So, a few months before he turned 18, he joined the German army, becoming one of more than 10,000 minors to sign up since mandatory military service ended in 2011.
""I wanted to experience something and to get to know my own limits, to see how far I can go,"" Marlon, who asked for his last name not be used, told Reuters at a base in Viereck, near the Polish border in northeastern Germany. 
The German military, or Bundeswehr https://www.bundeswehr.de/portal/a/bwde/start, has dramatically stepped up its recruitment efforts as part of a broader reset following Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. 
In 2017, Germany said it would increase the size of its armed forces to 198,000 active soldiers by 2024 from 179,000. 
Pressure on Berlin to beef up its military mounted again in July when U.S. President Donald Trump told a NATO summit that Washington could withdraw support for the alliance if Europe did not boost military spending.
To help attract new recruits, the military has targeted youngsters with slick online video campaigns, drawing criticism from some left-wing politicians and child welfare advocates in Germany, where the army remains a sensitive career choice more than 70 years after World War Two. 
But the campaigns are paying off.
In 2017, 2,128 people under 18 joined the German army, up 11.4 percent from 2016 and accounting for 9 percent of new recruits, according to government data.
VOLUNTEER ARMY
With lively music and scenes showing the lives of young soldiers, the Bundeswehr's shows on YouTube, which is owned by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), have attracted more than 64 million views.
In October, traffic at the Bundeswehr jobs website increased 60 percent during a six-week broadcast of ""Mali"", a YouTube series centered on eight soldiers serving in the U.N.'s peacekeeping mission in the West African country.
The Bundeswehr Exclusive YouTube channel has over 330,000 followers and its latest production portrays the lives of a group of young paratroopers. The army is also active on other sites such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Instagram and Snapchat.
According to a Trendence Institut https://www.trendence.com survey of 20,000 school students across the country, the military is now considered Germany's third most attractive employer, behind sportswear maker Adidas (DE:ADSGN) and the police in first place.
Overall, the army spent about 35 million euros ($40 million) on recruitment last year, more than double its spending in 2011, the year compulsory military service ended, annual parliament reports about the Bundeswehr showed.
""The Bundeswehr today is a volunteer army ... Therefore, it must approach young people to win them over,"" a spokeswoman for the personnel management department at the Bundeswehr said. 
Before signing up, Marlon said he browsed the army's website and watched a series of YouTube videos.
He needed his mother's consent to join because he was under 18, but she was happy to give it and is now pleased her once-messy son has become more organized, Marlon said.
'WRONG SIGNAL'
The Bundeswehr says the YouTube content aims to offer a realistic and authentic image of life in the military, but some politicians and children's rights advocates argue the glossy marketing gives minors a false impression.
""The entire advertising efforts of the Bundeswehr are more adventurous than a realistic description of the job,"" Tobias Pflueger, defense policy spokesman for the pacifist Left Party https://en.die-linke.de/welcome. 
More than 30,000 people signed a letter delivered to German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen a year ago that urged the Bundeswehr to stop recruiting minors.
She said then that the army must have the same chance as other employers to attract people before they turn 18, adding that minors were trained in safe spaces and didn't handle weapons alone until they turned 18.
""This is embarrassing and sends a wrong signal to the world,"" said Ralf Willinger from rights group terre des hommes https://www.tdh.de. 
""It weakens the international 18-year standard, encouraging armed groups and armies from other countries to legitimate the use of minors as soldiers."" 
Recruits under 18 in Germany undergo military training like other adult trainees, but they have special provisions such as not being allowed to participate in guard duty or foreign missions, and weapons are only used for educational purposes.
Ilka Hoffmann, a board member at the GEW union https://www.gew.de that represents about 280,000 teachers, social workers and education workers, says the nature of military work meant there should be more caution about hiring under 18s.

""This is not a normal profession. In no other profession does one learn to kill, and is one confronted with the danger of dying in war. That is the one difference,"" Hoffmann said.

Yuriy Fedynsky, 43, born into the Ukrainian diaspora in the United States, moved to the country of his ancestors and set about resurrecting an almost lost tradition of lyrical ballads known as ""dumas"".
The songs were popular in Ukraine from the 15th century, but the tradition almost died out under Soviet repression in the 1930s. The flame was kept alive in rural areas. 
Fedynsky lives in Kryachkivka, a village in Poltava region 145 km (90 miles) east of Kiev believed to have once been the home of a group of blind musicians who traveled the country barefoot. 
They sang to the accompaniment of the bandura, a string instrument reminiscent of the harp, and the kobza, an instrument similar to a modern day lute. 
""To revive a tradition you have to find elements of the lost tradition,"" said Fedynsky. He described this as difficult, with no kobza players alive and no surviving instruments to work from. 
""So to revive a tradition, it's a lot of work, it's a lot of research. You have to go to the museums, you have to make blueprints, you have to learn how to make instruments. 

""You have to learn how to make good instruments and then you can start playing or at least learning to play,"" he said.

Low, popularly known as Jho Low, is regarded as having been close to former prime minister Najib Razak and has been identified by investigators in Malaysia and the United States as a key figure in the 1MDB case. 
He was slapped with eight charges of money laundering at a court in the administrative capital Putrajaya, Amar Singh, the director of police commercial crime investigations told Reuters on Friday.
Low's father Low Hock Peng was booked for one charge under the same money laundering act, he said. 
""Warrants of arrest for both of them were issued by the Court,"" Singh said.
A spokesman for Low said in a statement sent by email that Low maintains his innocence and is confident he will be vindicated. 
""Mr. Low and his lawyers request that the public keep an open mind until all of the evidence comes to light. This has been a case of “trial-by-media” from the start, and unfortunately, the circus continues,"" the statement said. 
Low and his family's whereabouts are unknown, but Malaysian lawmakers and enforcement officials have said the 38-year-old financier is believed to be living in China. Some media reports say he may be in Abu Dhabi.
The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) and Singapore authorities had previously issued arrest warrants for Low.
Malaysia has also applied for an Interpol red notice to seek assistance from the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, India, Myanmar, China and Hong Kong to detain Low.
Low has said previously that he will not present himself to any country where his guilt has been predetermined.
Investigations into 1MDB were reopened after Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad returned to power in a stunning election victory in May, ending Najib's decade-long rule. 
Last month, Najib was charged for money laundering and abuse of power in connection with funds transferred from a former unit of 1MDB. Najib has denied wrongdoing. 
The DOJ says over $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB, with some of the money used to buy a private jet, a superyacht, Picasso paintings, jewelry and real estate.
Earlier this month, the $250 million superyacht Equanimity, which the DOJ says was bought by Jho Low, arrived in Kuala Lumpur after it was seized by authorities.

Attempts are also underway to impound Low's $35 million private jet that was grounded in Singapore last year.

Karachi, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistan has called for the United States to amend what its foreign ministry described as a ""factually incorrect"" account of a phone call between U.S. Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo and new Prime Minister Imran Khan.
The row comes ahead of a planned visit by Pompeo to Islamabad in the first week of September to meet with Khan, who was sworn in as prime minister last week.
The U.S. State Department readout of the call said Pompeo wished Khan success and also asked Khan to take ""decisive action against all terrorists operating in Pakistan"".
U.S. officials regularly raise the issue of Taliban and other militants operating from safe havens in Pakistan, where they plot attacks on U.S. and Afghan troops across the border.
Pakistan regularly denies that the Afghan Taliban operates from its soil.
And overnight on Thursday, Pakistan's foreign ministry asserted that the issue of militants never came up in the phone call between Pompeo and Khan. 
""Pakistan takes exception to the factually incorrect statement issued by U.S. State Dept on today's phone call,"" the spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Twitter.
""There was no mention at all in the conversation about terrorists operating in Pakistan. This should be immediately corrected.""
The U.S. embassy in Islamabad could not immediately be reached for comment.
Pompeo is expected in Islamabad on September 5, and is likely to be the first foreign dignitary to meet with Khan since he was sworn in.

Khan is well known for his criticism of U.S. military policy in Afghanistan, but he said after winning elections last week that he seeks better relations with the United States after a series of aid cuts and the suspension of U.S. military training.

HANOI (Reuters) - More than 3,000 people in Vietnam, most of them women and children, were trafficked between 2012 and 2017, many of them into China, the Ministry of Public Security said on Friday, as parliament sought to tighten laws to tackle the problem.
Human traffickers took people from markets and schools, and used Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and a Vietnamese messaging app to befriend victims before selling them to karaoke bars, restaurants or smuggling them abroad, the ministry said in a statement.
Seventy-five percent of cases involved people being smuggled across the border into China, the ministry said.
""Human trafficking has been taking place across the country, not just in remote and mountainous areas,"" Le Thi Nga, head of the National Assembly's justice department, told a hearing on the problem on Thursday.
The National Assembly is reviewing its anti-human trafficking law, introduced in 2012.
Nga said enforcement of the law had faced ""difficulties and shortcomings"" and urged legislators to introduce more comprehensive guidelines.
The Ministry of Public Security said police had launched investigations into 1,021 human trafficking cases and arrested 2,035 people in the 2012-2017 period.
A total of 3,090 people had been victims of human trafficking during that time, the ministry said, of whom 90 percent were women and children from ethnic minorities living in remote, mountainous areas.

Vietnam should ""reduce poverty, eradicate illiteracy, provide vocational training and create jobs for people - especially for the ethnic minorities"", to help address the problem, the ministry said.

787,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2018 02:50AM ET</span>","Amid praise for Trump, North Korea doubles down on criticism of Japan","By Josh Smith
SEOUL (Reuters) - In North Korea, Japan appears to have replaced the United States as the most vilified imperialist enemy, with state media deriding Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government as a ""cult"" bent on derailing Pyongyang's diplomatic outreach.
North Korea's blistering broadsides against Japan are nothing new, given its position as a hated former colonial power and a key player in international efforts to punish Pyongyang with sanctions over its pursuit of nuclear weapons. 
But Pyongyang's continued jabs at Tokyo contrast a recent easing in explicit criticism of the historically ""imperialist aggressor"", the United States.
North Korea spent most of last year calling U.S. President Donald Trump names such as a ""mentally deranged U.S. dotard"" and ""loser"", and has begun to complain again about Washington's insistence on denuclearisation.
But since Trump's June summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, North Korea’s top state-run newspaper has praised the U.S. president's ""will and decision"" to have the ""historic"" meeting. Many pieces of anti-American propaganda have also disappeared from Pyongyang's streets.
Abe has earned no such love.
The same state newspaper recently called the Japanese prime minister a ""kingpin of corruption … and a crooked politician"" who has ""done only evil deeds since he took power"". 
Japan has been skeptical of North Korea’s diplomatic charm offensive, which has led to summits with Trump, as well as leaders of South Korea and China.
Trump hailed the summit in Singapore as a success and even went as far as to declare the nuclear threat from North Korea over, but Pyongyang has given no indication it is willing abandon its arsenal unilaterally.
Tokyo is also pushing hard to resolve the sensitive issue of Japanese abducted by North Korea. North Korea admitted in 2002 it had kidnapped 13 Japanese in the 1970s and 1980s to train as spies, and five of them returned to Japan. Tokyo suspects that hundreds more may have been taken.
Abe's government has floated the idea of a meeting with Kim to discuss abductions and other issues but seems to have made little progress.
Japan's ""isolation"" amid the engagement with Pyongyang has been a central theme in North Korean state media, which has derided Japan as an ""old phonograph record"" spouting ""gibberish"" and repeatedly ridiculed Tokyo’s ""disgrace and shame"" at being left on the sidelines of diplomatic efforts.
""It seems Japan is indifferent to the world's advice to keep up its policy with the changed situation and the changed trend,"" said one commentary released by the KCNA news agency earlier this month. 
""It is ridiculous that Japan still trumpets about time-worn 'threat' at a time when a new era of peace settles on the Korean peninsula and in the region,"" another KCNA dispatch said at the end of July. ""Japan would be well advised to think of a way to join in the trend of the times.""
After speaking with Trump by phone on Wednesday, Abe said Tokyo and Washington are in ""complete agreement regarding the policy of realizing complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula,"" and said he raised the abductees as the issue ""most important of all.""
KCNA has called Japan's focus on the abduction issue, denuclearisation, and continued sanctions ""clear proof of Japan's strong attachment to the moves to harass peace... out of an intention to tarnish the positive atmosphere on the Korean peninsula.""
Japan is unlikely to avoid North Korean ire any time soon, analysts say.
The repeated salvos of rhetoric highlight North Korea’s continued need for an enemy to target, as well as possible hopes to push Tokyo into providing cash as part of economic incentives to get North Korea to limit its weapons program, said Alexis Dudden, a Korea and Japan expert at the University of Connecticut.
Abe's hardline stance and cool relations with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, as well as Japan's occupation of the Korean peninsula as a colonial power makes Japan a ""soft target"" for Pyongyang that is unlikely to upset many in South Korea, Dudden said. Japan ruled Korea for 35 years ending with its defeat in World War II. 
""By keeping Japanese colonial era atrocities in play, North Korea is able to be 'Korean' together with South Korea at a time that their separate ongoing negotiations require a common baseline,"" she said. 

""Continuing to 'hate' America - long the major focus - would be out of step because President Moon has made clear that he is working together with the United States in his efforts.""

JAKARTA (Reuters) - A top Indonesian anti-corruption investigator plans to release the findings of his own probe into an acid attack that partially blinded him last year, after a failure by police up to now to solve the case.
Novel Baswedan, an investigator at the country's Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK), has undergone multiple surgeries on his eyes since acid was flung in his face while he was walking home from a mosque in April, 2017/
The shocking assault heightened concerns about the vulnerability of those trying to fight endemic graft in Southeast Asia's biggest economy. 
""I am convinced that this attack has something to do with graft cases that I handled,"" Baswedan told a briefing organized by the Jakarta Foreign Correspondents Club on Thursday.
He declined to elaborate, but said one case was related to a police general. 
A police investigation has so far failed to reveal who carried out or ordered the attack, even though President Joko Widodo had called for the case to be solved quickly. 
""Initially, I fully supported the investigation conducted by fellow policemen so that they could address this case and find out the perpetrators as quickly as possible,"" said Baswedan, who was a police investigator before joining the KPK.
But he said later he had come to the view that ""they are not really serious in dealing with my case.""
Baswedan said his own probe had identified ""intellectual actors behind the attack"", while also uncovering ""irregularities"" in the police investigation, noting the elimination of CCTV footage and intimidation of witnesses.
""I have reported this to Komnas HAM (Indonesia's National Commission on Human Rights) for further investigation and my team of lawyers and I have also conducted our own investigation and I will soon disclose the results,"" said Baswedan, whose left eye had to be rebuilt by specialists in Singapore after the attack.
He said he had been attacked at least five times previously, including attempts to run him over while riding a motorbike.
Argo Yuwono, Jakarta's police spokesman, said the force was serious about resolving the case and denied that CCTV footage potentially useful to the case was not being used or that witnesses had been intimidated.
He said that the team set up to investigate the case was sharing its progress with the KPK and the national ombudsman. 
Referring to the broader fight against corruption in Indonesia, Baswedan said it was crucial for the current president and the next government, with elections due in April next year, to do more to clean up the police and other legal institutions.
The KPK has jailed a string of high-ranking officials in the past decade, but Indonesians still have to contend with high levels of graft in many areas of their lives.

Transparency International placed the Southeast Asian nation 96th among 180 countries in its annual corruption perceptions index last year, on a par with neighboring Thailand and Colombia.

789,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2018 01:50AM ET</span>",Brazil's Lula plays kingmaker from his prison cell,"By Lisandra Paraguassu and Anthony Boadle
CURITIBA/RECIFE (Reuters) - It is Thursday outside a government building in this tidy city in southern Brazil. Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the country's former president, is receiving visitors to plot his political future. 
Never mind that this compound, the regional federal police headquarters, doubles as a prison for corrupt politicians. Or that Lula, as this leftist icon is universally known, is serving a 12-year sentence for graft. 
Despite his predicament, Lula is still calling the shots in his Workers Party (PT) and engineering another presidential run, underscoring his stature as the most popular modern political figure in Brazil. During his two presidential terms, which ran from 2003 to 2011, the economy soared, poverty plunged and Brazil basked in the international spotlight, winning bids to host the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games. 
PT lieutenants regularly visit Lula in prison to map out strategy ahead of October's presidential balloting, eight party insiders told Reuters. This day's crop included Vagner Freitas, head of Brazil's most powerful trade union. Lula's vice presidential running mate Fernando Haddad, and Gleisi Hoffmann, the PT's president, showed up the following day.
Outside the lock-up, vendors sold T-shirts with Lula's bearded visage to the partisan crowd. Occasional chants of ""Lula president, Lula innocent"" filled the air. 
His candidacy is the longest of long shots. Convicted felons are banned from running for office. An electoral court is expected in coming weeks to declare him ineligible for October's race.
Critics decry Lula's bid as a stunt aimed at motivating the base and propping up Haddad, his likely stand-in. The former mayor of Sao Paulo, Haddad is little-known outside that city - and disliked by many in it.
But in a chaotic political season in Brazil, Lula could be the kingmaker. The presidential contest is unpredictable, loaded with candidates struggling to connect with voters. Brazilians are despondent over their nation's stagnant economy, rampant violence and ineffective political class. 
The PT is betting Lula's star power can remind voters of more prosperous times when he ran the show. At 72, the charismatic former metal worker still dominates the party he founded and shows no signs of letting prison constrain him.
""There is no question that Lula is a key political actor,"" said Ricardo Ismael, a political scientist at the Catholic University in Rio de Janeiro. ""Lula will have tremendous influence even if he is not a candidate. He has prestige and is a political force, mainly with the poorer voters.""
In handwritten letters and conversations relayed by visitors tasked with carrying out his orders, the former president has quelled infighting that had threatened his leadership, both inside the PT and in a coalition of allied parties, several senior party members who have met with Lula in jail told Reuters.
They say he effectively knee-capped a political rival with designs on his mantle, and arranged for his surrogate Haddad to take his place atop the PT ticket should he be barred from running.
Federal prosecutors are fed up with Lula's maneuvering. 
The team whose investigation put him in jail has asked a judge to restrict his jailhouse visitors. In a sealed court document dated June 28 and obtained by Reuters, they said Lula has transformed his cell ""into his campaign headquarters."" They want to limit the list to family, clergy and lawyers working specifically on his legal defense.
The judge has yet to make a decision.
Meanwhile, polls show Lula leads a pack of 13 candidates in a potential first-round matchup; the top two vote-getters advance to a run-off if no one wins a majority.
Still, plenty of Brazilians despise the former president, whose big-spending policies and scandals they blame for plunging Brazil into a tailspin. Others are eager to move on to fresh leadership. Some fear his meddling could ultimately deliver the presidency to the race's most extreme candidate, Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right ex-military man who has cheered Brazil's former dictatorship and delights in sullying Lula's legacy.

SERENADES, SUNBATHS, SOLITUDE
Until Lula arrived, Curitiba was best-known as the base of Judge Sergio Moro, who is overseeing a sweeping corruption probe known as Operation Car Wash.
That ongoing investigation revealed a massive bribes-for-public works scheme that ensnared Lula along with scores of business leaders and politicians from all major parties. Lula was convicted last year for accepting renovations to a luxury beach apartment from a construction firm in exchange for helping it win contracts with state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA or Petrobras. He faces five additional corruption trials. He maintains his innocence.
Since Lula was jailed on April 7, the area around Curitiba's federal police headquarters has morphed into the epicenter of leftist resistance. Supporters have proclaimed Lula a political prisoner. They allege right-wing enemies conspired to drive the PT from power by jailing him and impeaching his hand-picked successor, former President Dilma Rousseff. She was tossed from office in 2016 for fudging government accounts, which she denies.
Now unions, the Landless Workers Movement and private citizens have rented a few houses in Curitiba to stay while keeping vigil. 
Among the roughly 150 supporters who assemble daily outside the jail is Adinaldo Aparecido Batista, an unemployed construction worker. He recounted the abundant jobs, anti-poverty programs and consumer credit that flourished under Lula. 
""I was able to buy three cars and even a little inn,"" said Batista, 52. ""Now, I have almost nothing."" 
These faithful gather every morning to chant ""good morning, President Lula!"" After night falls, they call in unison to bid him sweet dreams. On weekends, musicians belt out ballads to raise his spirits. 
Lula occupies a 160-square-foot room at the federal police building that once housed visiting officers. A handful of other politicians and businessmen are incarcerated in formal, shared cells. Lula is not allowed to mix with other prisoners.
Those familiar with his routine spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly. They said Lula is allowed to wear his own clothing, often a soccer jersey, and can spend up to two hours daily in an open courtyard. His room contains a TV and a treadmill where he logs four miles daily. He has access to books and devotes hours to writing.
Still, the gregarious Lula lives for his visitors, the people said. Clergy come on Mondays. Thursdays are for family and friends. 
But the real access belongs to Lula's legal team, whose members can come at any time and stay as long as they like, without supervision or electronic eavesdropping from jailers. The PT's Haddad and Hoffmann, both lawyers, are on that team, enabling them to carry out Lula's directives and spread his message.
Among the most visible moves, people familiar with the situation say, was Lula's order to undercut the presidential chances of Ciro Gomes of the center-left Democratic Labor Party (PDT). Gomes appeals to some Brazilian progressives and could siphon votes from Lula or Haddad.
So the PT struck a deal with another leftist party. The Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB) agreed to withhold support from Gomes and remain neutral in the presidential contest, the people said. In exchange, the PT agreed to back a PSB candidate in a gubernatorial contest.
Gomes, who has yet to catch fire in the polls, is steaming at what he sees as betrayal. Long an ally of Lula and the PT, Gomes said in a TV interview that he has been repaid with ""disrespect and hostility."" 
The PT acknowledges playing hardball.
""The number one priority was Lula's candidacy,"" a PT spokesman said.
Such bare-knuckle tactics have not dissuaded true believers like retired teacher Gliceria Polak. She was among those chanting to Lula on a recent morning in Curitiba.

""If he has to serve out his 12-year sentence here, I will never leave this place,"" she said. ""Under no circumstances will I abandon Lula.""

India and China fought a war in 1962 and the unresolved dispute over stretches of their 3,500 km (2,200 miles) border has clouded relations ever since.

But the two big Asian economies share similar positions on a host of issues including concern about U.S. tariffs and Chinese President Xi Jinping and Modi agreed in April to improve relations.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A South Korean appeals court sentenced former President Park Geun-hye to 25 years in jail on Friday in a case arising from a far-reaching corruption scandal that toppled her from power in 2017.
Park became South Korea's first democratically elected leader to be forced from office when the Constitutional Court removed her over a scandal that landed the heads of two conglomerates in jail. 
The Seoul High Court found that Park colluded with her friend, Choi Soon-sil, to receive tens of billions of won from major conglomerates to help Choi's family and fund non-profit foundations owned by her, according to the court documents. 
""Such unethical dealings between political power and financial power harms the essence of democracy and distorts order in the market economy, giving the people a grave sense of loss and deep distrust of our society,"" presiding judge Kim Mun-suk said in the ruling. 
""A strict penalty is unavoidable,"" Kim said.
The court also fined Park, the daughter of a former military dictator, 20 billion won ($17.86 million) after finding her guilty of charges including abuse of power, bribery and coercion. 
A lower court had jailed Park for 24 years in April. Prosecutors appealed against that decision, seeking a tougher sentence. Park had given up on appeals.
Another South Korean court sentenced Park in July to eight more years in prison in a separate case arising from the same scandal, finding her guilty on charges of causing the loss of government funds and interfering in a 2016 parliamentary election.
Park has been defended by state attorneys after her former defense team quit en masse last year in protest against a Seoul court's handling of her case, including the extension of her detention.
Park, 66, has been in jail since March 31, 2017, but has denied wrongdoing and was not present in court. She returned to South Korea's presidential palace in 2012 as the country's first woman leader more than three decades after she left it following the assassination of her father. 

Her ouster last year led to a presidential election won by the liberal Moon Jae-in, whose conciliatory stance on North Korea has led to a significant warming of ties with the North.

Paul Ceglia, 45, a wood pellet salesman from Wellsville in upstate New York, had been missing since March 2015, when he removed his electronic ankle bracelet and disappeared with his wife, two children and a dog.
Ceglia fled less than two months before his scheduled trial in Manhattan federal court on mail fraud and wire fraud charges, over his alleged forging of documents to extort Facebook and Zuckerberg.
In a letter to U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick, prosecutors said Ceglia was arrested in Ecuador on Thursday morning and is expected to appear by Friday in a court in Quito, the country's capital.
Prosecutors said they will update Broderick as they learn more about Ceglia's extradition proceedings.
The criminal case arose from Ceglia's conduct related to a 2010 civil lawsuit he had filed against Zuckerberg.
Ceglia claimed that Zuckerberg had, while a student at Harvard University, signed a 2003 contract giving him half of a planned social networking website that later became Facebook.
U.S. District Judge Richard Arcara in Buffalo dismissed Ceglia's lawsuit after another judge said the contract was doctored.
The market value of Menlo Park, California-based Facebook is now close to $500 billion, and Forbes magazine said Zuckerberg's own net worth is about $64.8 billion.
Ceglia was criminally charged in November 2012. News of his arrest was earlier reported by WGRZ television in Buffalo, about 85 miles (137 km) northwest of Wellsville.
Robert Ross Fogg, a lawyer for Ceglia in the criminal case, in a Thursday phone interview said he was ""relieved"" that Ceglia appeared to have been located without incident, and was ""hoping that he and his family are safe.""
He also said there remained a ""strong case"" for Ceglia's defense, and that Ceglia's alleged agreement with Zuckerberg ""truly was a contract.""
Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The case is U.S. v. Ceglia, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 12-cr-00876.

Jacob Goodwin, 23, one of three men convicted or pleading guilty to the beating, was sentenced by a Charlottesville Circuit Court judge, WVIR-TV in Charlottesville and others reported.
Court officials and the Charlottesville prosecutor were not immediately available for comment. As of Thursday afternoon, online court records did not include a sentence.
Another co-defendant, Alex Ramos, is set to be sentenced later on Thursday by the same judge, the TV station said. The final man charged in the beating, Daniel Borden, pleaded guilty in May and is set for sentencing in October, court records showed.
Goodwin, who said he acted in self-defense, was convicted by a jury in May. He has said in an interview with the NBC TV network that he belongs to a white nationalist group in Arkansas.
DeAndre Harris, 20, suffered a broken arm and a spinal injury in the attack, which took place when there was a rally by white nationalists in the Virginia city. Harris can be seen in a video of the incident being beaten with poles and kicked while he is on the ground.
At the same ""Unite the Right"" rally, a man drove a car into a group of demonstrators protesting against white nationalists, killing a woman. James Fields faces murder and hate crime charges in forthcoming trials in that incident.

796,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2018 05:01PM ET</span>","Colombia to host meeting with Ecuador, Peru on Venezuelan migrant issue","BOGOTA (Reuters) - Officials from Colombia, Ecuador and Peru will meet in Bogota next week to seek a solution to a growing exodus of migrants overwhelming South American countries as they flee a devastating economic crisis in Venezuela.
The head of Colombia's migration authority, Christian Kruger, said in a statement on Thursday the three nations would meet on Monday and Tuesday to discuss problems caused by thousands of Venezuelans who cross borders each day and the impact of recently implemented passport controls by Peru and Ecuador.
""The exodus of Venezuelan citizens is not a problem exclusive to Colombia, Peru, Ecuador or a single country. This is a regional problem and as such we must address it,"" Kruger said.
In the past two weeks, both Ecuador and Peru have announced tighter entry rules for Venezuelans, requiring them to carry valid passports instead of just national ID cards. In Brazil, rioters drove hundreds of migrants back over the border.
Venezuela's Information Ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Peru's foreign minister said on Tuesday that Lima was calling for a meeting of the permanent council of the Organization of American States to discuss Venezuelan migration.
More than a million Venezuelan migrants have entered Colombia over the past 15 months, according to official estimates, but Ecuador, Peru, Chile and Brazil have also received many migrants. 
The statement said the new passport measures had cut the number of Venezuelans crossing legally through passport controls in Colombia but increased the number crossing borders illegally.
""Demanding passports from a nation that does not have them and whose government does not facilitate the issuance of this document is to encourage irregularity,"" Kruger said.
Over the past two years, many Venezuelans have struggled to obtain passports amid the OPEC nation's political and economic chaos.
A growing wave of migrants has inundated border towns and flooded some Latin American job markets with low-skilled Venezuelans desperate for work in order to send money back to their homeland.

With the International Monetary Fund forecasting that Venezuela's inflation could reach 1 million percent by year's end, malnutrition is on the rise, as a monthly minimum wage that amounts to a few U.S. dollars puts basic products like chicken out of reach for many.

797,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2018 05:00PM ET</span>",U.S. senator plans measure to help Taiwan keep its allies,"By Patricia Zengerle
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A leading U.S. Republican senator said Thursday he is preparing legislation to discourage Taiwan's few remaining allies from switching their allegiance to China, after El Salvador became the third country this year to move toward Beijing.
Senator Cory Gardner, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee's Asia subcommittee, told Reuters he will introduce within a few days a measure encouraging countries to stick with Taipei.
Among other things, he said the measure would authorize the State Department to take action such as downgrading relations or altering foreign assistance to discourage decisions seen as adverse for Taiwan.
""The Taipei Act of 2018 would give greater tools and directions to the State Department in making sure we are as strong a voice as possible for Taiwan,"" Gardner told Reuters in a telephone interview.
It would require a U.S. strategy to engage with governments around the world to support Taiwan's diplomatic recognition or unofficial ties. It also would authorize State to downgrade U.S. relations, or suspend or alter U.S. foreign assistance, including foreign military financing, to governments that take adversarial actions with regard to Taiwan.
He stressed that the bill would not mandate action against countries that have chosen diplomatic relations with Beijing.
""This is a permissive bill,"" he said. ""It's something that gives one more tool in the bundle of tools to address Chinese bullying.""
On Tuesday, the State Department said the United States was ""deeply disappointed"" by El Salvador's decision and was reviewing its relationship with San Salvador, without elaborating further. 
Washington does not recognize Taipei diplomatically but considers it a staunch ally in the Pacific Rim. Several members of Congress, who see Beijing as a threat to U.S. security and international influence, have expressed frustration with what they see as President Donald Trump's failure to adopt a strategy for Taiwan.
A legislative effort to boost Taiwan, which would anger China, comes as Washington and Beijing have escalated an acrimonious trade war. On Thursday, the world's two biggest economies implemented punitive 25 percent tariffs on $16 billion worth of each other's goods.
Taiwan now has formal relations with only 17 countries, many of them small, less developed nations such as Belize and Nauru.
Gardner met last week with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen about what Congress could do to support Taiwan.
The senator said he had spoken to several Democratic senators, hoping to build bipartisan backing necessary for his bill to pass the chamber. He said he also planned to work with members of the House of Representatives and the White House.

China has claimed sovereignty over Taiwan since the 1940s, although both sides have been self-ruled since then. Beijing considers Taiwan a wayward province of ""one China,"" ineligible for state-to-state relations, and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control.

798,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2018 04:50PM ET</span>",U.S. State Department softens travel advisory on Cuba,"HAVANA (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday revised its travel advisory on Cuba to ""exercise increased caution,"" from ""reconsider travel,"" a move that some in the tourism sector hope could help reverse a decline in American visitors to the Caribbean island.
The U.S. State Department had warned its citizens last year not to visit the country because of a spate of still unexplained illnesses among its embassy personnel in Havana.
The new U.S. travel advisory acknowledges, however, that these so-called ""attacks"" seemed to target those personnel and not private citizens, and therefore simply advises travelers to ""exercise increased caution in Cuba.""
Cuba and many analysts have branded the warning on travel to the Communist-run island as politically motivated. Republican U.S. President Donald Trump had announced in 2017 he would partially roll back a detente with Havana by his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama. 
The State Department reported similar illnesses this year among U.S. Embassy staff in China, but did not issue a warning on travel to that country.
The warning on travel to Cuba along with tighter restrictions issued last year that made it more difficult for Americans to travel there independently have dampened a recent boom in U.S. visitors to the island.
That has particularly hurt those Cubans running bed-and-breakfasts and home-based restaurants in the fledgling private sector.
""There are lots of (Americans) interested in traveling to Cuba, but when they see the restrictions and difficulties they think about it more than twice,"" said Mauricio Alonso, who rents rooms in his house overlooking the sea.
Alonso said business had been impacted by the travel warning, but he hoped it would pick up again now. Others acknowledged the revised travel advisory was only one step of several needed to improve the mood of U.S. travelers concerning Cuba.

The number of U.S. visitors to Cuba for the first half of the year - not including Cuban-Americans - slumped 24 percent to 266,000, three different sources with access to Cuban tourism industry data told Reuters in July.

799,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2018 04:37PM ET</span>",Pompeo to travel to North Korea with new special envoy,"By Lesley Wroughton and David Brunnstrom
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will visit North Korea again next week to try to persuade it to abandon its nuclear weapons, and will take a new U.S. special representative, Stephen Biegun, with him in an attempt to break the deadlock. 
Pompeo on Thursday named the  Ford Motor Co  executive, a veteran Republican foreign policy hand, as the U.S. special envoy to North Korea.
""Steve will direct U.S. policy toward North Korea and lead our efforts to achieve President Trump's goal of the final, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea as agreed to by Kim Jong Un,"" Pompeo told reporters, referring to the North Korean leader.
""He and I will be traveling to North Korea next week to make further diplomatic progress toward our objective,"" Pompeo said.
It will be Pompeo's fourth trip this year aimed at getting North Korea to scrap a nuclear weapons program that threatens the United States and his second since an unprecedented June summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim that produced much fanfare but little obvious progress.
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Pompeo had no plans to meet with Kim in Pyongyang.
""We don't have that scheduled; we have no expectations of meeting with Chairman Kim. That is not a part of this trip,"" she told a regular news briefing.
Biegun said of North Korea: ""The issues are tough and will be tough to resolve."" But he added that Trump had created an opening ""that we must take by seizing every possible opportunity to realize the vision for a peaceful future for the people of North Korea.""
Biegun served as vice president of international governmental affairs for Ford (N:F) for 14 years. Prior to that, he was a senior staffer for former President George W. Bush’s national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, and he also advised members of Congress on foreign affairs.
Trump hailed the summit in Singapore as a success and even went as far as to declare that the nuclear threat from North Korea was over, but Pyongyang has given no indication that it is willing abandon its arsenal unilaterally.
Pompeo was charged with heading follow-up negotiations, but these appear to have made little progress, with the two sides apparently far apart on the fundamental issue of denuclearization and the U.S. demand for this before North Korea sees any relief from tough international sanctions.
'GANGSTER-LIKE DEMANDS'
On his last visit to Pyongyang, in July, Pompeo left hailing progress, only for North Korea within hours to denounce his ""gangster-like demands."" He did not meet with Kim on that trip, although he did on his first two visits, which took place before the summit.
In an interview with Reuters on Monday, Trump defended his efforts to convince Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons, saying he believed North Korea had taken specific steps toward denuclearization. He said he would ""most likely"" meet again with Kim.
However, several members of the U.S. negotiating team said they had seen no sign that North Korea was prepared to negotiate seriously until the United States promised relief from sanctions in return.
Some U.S. intelligence and defense officials consider Pompeo’s planned trip to be premature and said the prospects for significant progress appeared dim.
Kelly Magsamen, a former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense for Asian affairs now at the Center for American Progress, said Biegun's appointment would ""hopefully bring focus and coherence"" to U.S. North Korea diplomacy.
Joshua Pollack, a North Korea missile expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, noted that Biegun's background was mostly in Russian issues.
But Pollack said that Pompeo could enhance Biegun’s credibility as a negotiator by personally introducing him in Pyongyang. “That would allow Pompeo to step back somewhat until more groundwork has been laid in working-level talks,” he said. 
Biegun's name was floated earlier this year among a list of contenders to replace Trump’s then national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, who was ultimately succeeded by John Bolton.
Biegun fills a vacancy that has existed since the late February retirement of Joe Yun, an appointee of former President Barack Obama and a strong advocate for diplomacy with North Korea. Soon after Yun’s departure, Trump embraced a diplomatic approach to Pyongyang that led to the June summit.
North Korea state media last week blamed lack of progress on members of the U.S. negotiating team and said breaking the deadlock would demand ""a bold decision on the part of President Trump."" 

A commentary in its Rodong Sinmun newspaper said those opposed to dialogue were seeking to derail talks with baseless references to ""secret nuclear facilities"" in North Korea.

800,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2018 04:16PM ET</span>",Missouri launches probe of clergy sex abuse in St. Louis,"By Scott Malone and Bernie Woodall
(Reuters) - Missouri is launching a probe of potential sexual abuse in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis, state Attorney General Josh Hawley said on Thursday, following last week's Pennsylvania report finding widespread clergy sex abuse in that state.
Hawley said his office does not have the power to force institutions to cooperate with criminal investigations but was able to launch the probe after the archdiocese agreed to help.
""They say they want to cooperate fully and I'm confident they will,"" Hawley told reporters on a conference call. ""I am firmly of the view that full transparency benefits not only the public but also the church and, most importantly, it will help us expose and address potential wrongdoing and protect the vulnerable from abuse.""
St. Louis Archbishop Robert Carlson, in an interview with St. Louis NBC affiliate KSDK on Tuesday, said he would cooperate with investigators.
""We have always cooperated with whoever the prosecutor is,"" said Carlson, who has been the top Catholic official in the St. Louis since 2009. ""We have nothing to hide.""
A spokesman for Carlson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.
The probe initially covers only the Archdiocese of St. Louis, one of five Roman Catholic dioceses in the state, Hawley said. He asked the bishops of the four other dioceses to agree to cooperate with the probe. Dioceses are groupings of parishes and one of the main organizational structures of the Catholic church.
Pennsylvania officials last week released the results of a two-year grand jury probe that found evidence that at least 1,000 people, mostly children, had been sexually abused by some 300 clergymen in the state during the past 70 years. The most-wide ranging report on clergy sex abuse in the United States said the numbers of actual victims and abusers could be much higher.
Similar reports have emerged in Europe, Australia and Chile, prompting lawsuits and investigations, sending dioceses into bankruptcy and undercutting the moral authority of the leadership of the Catholic Church, which has some 1.2 billion members around the world.
Reuters last week contacted the attorneys general of the 49 states other than Pennsylvania to see if they were considering similar actions. Only two, in New York and New Mexico, at the time said they had taken some initial steps toward doing so.

SAN DIEGO/SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Representative Duncan Hunter and his wife Margaret pleaded not guilty on Thursday to federal charges alleging misuse of $250,000 in campaign funds, in a case that could help Democrats seize control of a traditionally Republican seat.
Hunter, an early supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump, is the second Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives to face criminal charges this month. On Aug. 8, U.S. Representative Christopher Collins of New York was charged with taking part in an insider trading scheme. Collins, who has suspended his re-election campaign, has called the charges baseless.
On Thursday, bail for Hunter was set at $15,000, and for Margaret Hunter at $10,000. 
""There are serious allegations in the indictment with a large amount of money stolen from the campaign by both defendants,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Phillip Halpern said of the Hunters on Thursday, as protesters shouted ""Shame! Shame!"" outside the courthouse.
Ashen-faced and wearing a muted plaid sport coat, Hunter spoke quietly in court, saying only ""not guilty"" when asked to enter a plea by U.S. Magistrate Judge William Gallo.
""The charges against me are politically motivated and without merit,"" Hunter said in a letter to Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan that was forwarded to Reuters after the hearing. ""I intend to fight them fully.""
In the letter, dated Thursday, Hunter asked Ryan to remove him from his congressional committee assignments, an action Ryan had already said he was planning to take. 
While he and Margaret Hunter were inside the courthouse being fingerprinted, protesters outside changed their chant to ""Lock him up!,"" a nod to the Trump campaign's rallying cry to imprison Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, who was investigated by the FBI for use of a private email server but never charged.
The indictment against Hunter and his wife on Tuesday came the same day that Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, was found guilty of tax and bank fraud, and former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to crimes including tax evasion, bank fraud and campaign finance violations.
The highly detailed indictment by a grand jury in San Diego alleged that the Hunters used campaign accounts to pay for their children's private school tuition, lavish travel including a trip to Italy and restaurant meals that frequently cost hundreds of dollars.
It also alleges the Hunters lied about how the money was spent, with the couple saying it went to charity or campaign events when prosecutors said it was really used for groceries, restaurant meals and clothing. 
""The Hunters’ improper use of campaign funds for personal expenses occurred despite numerous warnings about the prohibition against using campaign funds for personal expenses and repeated inquiries from Duncan Hunter’s campaign treasurer about questionable purchases,"" U.S. attorney Adam Braverman, an interim Trump administration appointee, said in a news release on Tuesday. 
TARGET LIST
Hunter, whose father, Duncan Hunter, Sr., also served in Congress, represents conservative portions of San Diego and Riverside counties in a seat that is generally considered safe for Republicans.
But the Hunters' legal woes could put the seat in play, according to political analysts. 
California is key to Democrats' efforts to wrest control of the U.S. House of Representatives from Trump's Republicans. 
The Democratic Party added Hunter's district to its list of targets months ago, and on Wednesday, election handicappers at the Cook Political Report assessed the district as merely ""leaning"" Republican, a change from its prior rating of ""solid Republican.""
The campaign of his Democratic opponent, Ammar Campa-Najjar, has already referenced the case in several news releases this week, and Campa-Najjar was on hand at the courthouse on Thursday, briefly addressing reporters and protesters.
The area will be difficult to pry away from Republican control, but in a sign of the Democrats' determination, top strategist Joe Trippi - whose advice helped Democrat Doug Jones defeat Republican Roy Moore in a U.S. Senate race in deep-red Alabama last year, signed on last month to lead Campa-Najjar's campaign. 
Trippi told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday he expects the criminal case against Hunter will lead more voters to support Campa-Najjar.
""This is something that is going to hang over him for a long time,"" he said, referring to Hunter. ""And with that I think a lot more people will be taking a closer look at Ammar.""

Speaking at the United Nations, Hunt said Britain was hopeful, but ""cautiously hopeful, rather than wildly hopeful"", about reaching an agreement with the EU on the terms of Brexit, as it was in the interests of both sides.

With little more than seven months to go until it leaves the EU on March 29, Britain has yet to reach an agreement with the bloc on the terms of its departure. Prime Minister Theresa May's plan for a ""business-friendly"" deal has failed to impress negotiators in Brussels and has been heavily criticized at home.
Austria will host a meeting of EU leaders in Salzburg on Sept. 20 with time pressing to clinch a deal to prevent Britain crashing out of the bloc that its people voted to leave in 2016.
""It was probably the worst decision of recent years - Britain's decision to leave the European Union,"" Kurz told a rally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives in Erfurt to applause. ""But the decision was taken and now it is about ensuring that contact remains good.""
""Britain is militarily, politically and economically tremendously significant on our continent,"" he said, adding that securing a good relationship was important to prevent further Brexit fallout for both Britain and the EU.
""Our big goal is to make a contribution during the presidency so that our chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, can continue to successfully lead the member states together, so that we can bring about a deal with Britain to avoid a hard Brexit and to secure an orderly future together,"" Kurz said.
Britain on Thursday told companies trading with the European Union they would face a tangle of red tape, possible border delays and more costly credit card payments if the government fails to negotiate an exit deal before Britain leaves the bloc.
After more than 40 years in the EU, Britain is having to set out its plans for every aspect of life.

Barnier said on Tuesday a deal with Britain was needed ""not much later"" than in early November and that the bloc was not working toward a ""no-deal"" Brexit, though it had to prepare for it.

Prilepin, who had been due to attend a literature event in the de facto Bosnian Serb capital Banja Luka on Friday, was turned back at the Raca border crossing between Serbia and Bosnia, the Russian embassy said in a statement.
""The Embassy expresses a concern and deep disappointment because of this incident. We have asked for an explanation from the Foreign Ministry of Bosnia and Herzegovina,"" it said.
Prilepin is associated with Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine. Bosnian media reported that the Bosnian Intelligence and Security Agency had issued an entry ban decree in March for him, citing security concerns.
The same month, leaders of the Russian Night Wolves motorcycle club were denied entry on the same grounds. The club is under U.S. sanctions for its role in a pro-Russian separatist insurgency in Ukraine.
The club had planned to tour Bosnia's autonomous Serb region as part of a swing through southeastern Europe under the slogan ""Russian Balkans"". Bosnia's top security official said the visit was driven by political motives rather than tourism.
Regional President Milorad Dodik, who is under U.S sanctions over an illegal referendum in the Serb region in 2016, said the entry ban on Prilepin was ""shameful, inadmissible and directed against friends of Republika Srpska (Bosnia's autonomous Serb Republic)"".
Many ethnic Serbs see Russia rather than Western Europe as an ally, partly because of a shared Orthodox religion and culture.
Prilepin received an award for his life achievements in 2017 in Andricgrad, in eastern Bosnia. Apart from involvement in Ukraine's pro-Russian rebel region, he fought in the conflict in Chechnya in the 1990s.

Peruvian Prime Minister Cesar Villanueva has condemned Belmont's rhetoric as opportunistic and dangerous. ""He's irresponsibly inciting violence,"" Villanueva, a centrist, said in broadcast comments on Tuesday. ""We can't politicize this problem.""
Some 400,000 Venezuelans are now in Peru, with the majority having entered the Andean country of some 32 million people this year, according to Peru's immigration agency.
Venezuelans selling candies and coffee on the streets of Lima are now a common sight. Local media have covered the capture of Venezuelan criminal gang members extensively.
""They're going to take jobs from us poor Peruvians,"" Belmont said in an interview on local TV channel ATV on Wednesday. ""Let's see them take a medical exam, like we ask of servants in our homes. Ask for a certificate of good conduct.""
The son of a Frenchman and an Italian woman, Belmont was mayor of Lima from 1990 to 1995 and was known for his down-to-earth style and focus on public work projects.
His reemergence as an outspoken critic of Venezuelan immigration as he campaigns for the job again is the latest sign of a simmering backlash in parts of South America where Venezuelans have settled, potentially playing into politics for years to come.
Recent opinion polls put Belmont second in a crowded race behind front-runner Renzo Reggiardo, who has called Belmont ""demagogic.""
Belmont's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. His supporters say that Peru, a developing country where some 22 percent of the population live in poverty, should do more to help its worst-off citizens instead of helping foreigners.
Last week, angry residents of a Brazilian border town who blamed Venezuelans for an assault in the town drove immigrants back to their country. Colombia, Ecuador and Peru have moved to require hard-to-get passports and not just national ID cards from Venezuelans, citing security concerns.
On Sunday, Vizcarra's government tightened the deadline by which Venezuelans must enter the country to be eligible for a temporary residency permit, closing the window at the end of October instead of the end of the year.

If elected mayor, Belmont would govern the city where most Venezuelan immigrants in Peru live, but would lack authority to decide policy on immigration. Belmont hinted in his ATV interview that he hopes to run for president in the future.

MATI, Greece (Reuters) - Standing in the burnt-out shell of what used to be his home and business, Theodoros Kouris waits for Greek government inspectors to decide the building's fate.
It has been one month since Greece's deadliest wildfire ravaged the now deserted seaside town of Mati, killing 96 people, and life here is still far from normal.
Funeral notices are plastered on electricity poles. The smell of burned pine still lingers in the air, along with a metallic odor from melted cars and other objects. A few people wander the streets, wearing surgical masks.
An inspector spray-paints a red triangle onto Kouris's wall, declaring the building that was his home and, next to it, his grocery store, unsuitable and set for demolition.
""My roots are here,"" the 43-year-old said softly, motioning to the ground. ""I was born here together with my late brother. I cannot accept that I will be uprooted.""
Kouris, his wife and their three children now live with relatives in Athens and hope to qualify for relief measures announced by the government, including financial assistance.
""We're hearing a lot of talk,"" he said. ""I hope that even a third of what they say materializes, so that we can rebuild and make a fresh start.""
More than 4,300 people have applied for state aid, the government said on Thursday. Engineers inspecting the area have so far ordered scores of buildings to be demolished.
Mati, a heavily wooded area which sits on the coast east of Athens overlooking the sparkling sea, was popular with pensioners and children at summer camps. Now scorched, it resembles a ghost town. 
""The area has become desolate,"" a 50-year-old woman who gave her name as Maria said, as she and her daughter filled bags of wreckage cleared out from a summer home built by her grandfather. 
Even those whose houses were not destroyed have left the area, not only over a lack of electricity and water but because, Maria said, ""the atmosphere is heavy.""
""I believe it will take years before we can return to normal circumstances,"" she said. 
Sitting in the blackened yard, Maria's 85-year-old mother was there to bid farewell to the house in the event it was torn down.
""The house burned down but my memories have not,"" Maria said. ""Houses can be rebuilt. People don't come back.""

SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgaria's president has criticized a planned visit by defense officials to Washington just as the country seeks bids to supply warplanes from the United States and several other countries.
The defense ministry had on Tuesday said a delegation led by Deputy Minister Atanas Zapryanov will visit the United States next week after an invitation from the U.S. Embassy in Sofia.
But President Rumen Radev, a former air force commander, said on Thursday the visit could put some of the possible bidders in a less favorable position.
""In countries where there is equal treatment, no meetings, visits or talks are held from the moment of sending invitations for offers for aircraft supply until their submission,"" Radev said.
Last month the Black Sea state, which joined NATO in 2004, sent a request for proposals (RFP) to Portugal, Israel, Italy, Germany, France and Sweden for 16 new or used fighter jets to replace its aging Soviet-designed MiG-29s. 
The question of which warplanes to buy has vexed successive governments in Bulgaria for more than a decade. But NATO is encouraging its eastern members to develop, buy and operate new equipment.
""The only acceptable meeting is a conference at which all participants could receive information,"" Radev, elected in November 2016 with backing from the opposition Socialists, said.
Radev said the visit to the United States was a decision of the defense ministry that was not coordinated with him. The president of Bulgaria is also the chief commander of the military of the country.
The defense ministry was not immediately available for comment.
In June Bulgaria's parliament approved a plan to buy the jets in two equal stages. Some 1.8 billion levs ($1 billion) will cover the first eight aircraft, as well as ground handling, team training and three years of initial logistics support.
Potential options include Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet, Saab's Gripen, Dassault's Rafale and Lockheed Martin's F-16 or the Eurofighter. Sofia is asking manufacturers to make bids by Oct. 1.

Maxime Bernier, who failed in his bid to lead the Conservative Party more than a year ago, said he hoped to have an alternative party up and running within weeks to challenge Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the 2019 election.
The Conservatives, who are neck and neck in polls with Trudeau's Liberals, split into two factions in 1987, but reunified the party in 2003 and later held power for nearly a decade under former prime minister Stephen Harper.
Speaking out against ""fake news"" and saying the Conservatives under leader Andrew Scheer were ""too intellectually and morally corrupt to be reformed,"" Bernier announced his split at a news conference in Ottawa just as the party was gathering in Halifax for its annual convention.
""The Conservative party has abandoned conservatives. It does not represent them anymore. And it has nothing of substance to offer Canadians looking for a political alternative,"" Bernier said.
""I want to do politics differently. I will find another way to give a voice to millions of Canadians,"" he added.

Bernier is a second-generation politician and former foreign minister, a libertarian free-market champion who is also remembered for being dumped from Harper's cabinet after leaving confidential documents at the house of a girlfriend with links to organized crime.

Israel's liaison office for Gaza, Cogat, named the Palestinian as Hani Majdalawi and said he was shot dead on Monday after shooting and throwing a grenade at soldiers.
""We have reached out to Doctors without Borders for clarification regarding the matter,"" a Cogat spokesman said.
The organization did not immediately reply to phone and email queries by Reuters. Its website says that the group runs three burns and trauma centers in Gaza, whose Islamist Hamas rulers have fought three wars against Israel in the last decade.
Gaza authorities did not confirm Majdalawi's death, saying that would require having his body, which they believed was being held by Israel. The Israeli military said they could not immediately confirm this.
No armed Palestinian factions claimed Majdalawi as a member.
Responding to Israeli media reports on Majdalawi's killing, his brother, Osama, described the married 28-year-old on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) as a ""martyr"" who had ""bought the weapon with his own money"" and acted ""completely independently"". 
The Facebook post said Hani Majdalawi had worked for Doctors Without Borders and that he had been ""the most socially, psychologically and economically stable among his brothers"". 
Gaza has seen an almost five-month surge in confrontations along the border, where Palestinians have held weekly, sometimes violent mass demonstrations, drawing Israeli army gunfire. At least 170 Palestinians have been killed.

ROME (Reuters) - Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said on Thursday his party would vote to suspend funding to the European Union next year unless other states agreed to take in migrants being held on a coastguard ship in Sicily.
Three days after Italy's Diciotti coastguard vessel docked in Catania, 150 adult migrants remained on deck. After seeing hundreds of thousands of sea arrivals in recent years, Italy wants other EU countries to accept them.
The European Commission has said repeatedly this week that it is working to find an agreement. Other such deals were found in June and July for ships carrying rescued migrants that docked in both Italy and Malta.
""If tomorrow nothing comes out of a European Commission meeting on redistributing migrants from the Diciotti ship, the 5-Star and I will not be willing to give 20 billion euros each year to the EU,"" Di Maio said in a video posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Di Maio is the leader of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which is in a coalition government with the far-right League and its leader, Matteo Salvini, who has championed a hard line against immigration since taking office in June.
Di Maio said he agrees with Salvini's position that the migrants should stay on the ship until there is an agreement in the EU, a day after the 5-Star speaker of the lower house of parliament criticized Salvini.
KIDNAPPING CHARGES?
Salvini, who is also interior minister, was defiant on Thursday in the face of a criminal probe into possible kidnapping charges for forcing the migrants to remain on the vessel.
The chief prosecutor from the Agrigento court, Luigi Patronaggio, on Wednesday boarded the Diciotti and said afterwards he had opened a probe against ""unknown"" persons for holding the migrants against their will.
""There's a court that is investigating whether those illegally on board the ship have been kidnapped,"" Salvini said in a radio interview.
""I'm not unknown. My name is Matteo Salvini... I'm the Interior Minister and I think it is my duty to defend the security of this country's borders.""
A public backlash against the arrivals of hundreds of thousands of seaborne newcomers in the past five years helped put Di Maio and Salvini into office.
Salvini allowed 27 unaccompanied minors off the ship late Wednesday.
Humanitarian groups - including the United Nations refugee agency, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and Doctors without Borders - on Thursday renewed calls for the migrants' release from the vessel.
""Migrants who arrive from Libya are often the victims of violence, abuse and torture, and their vulnerabilities should be quickly and adequately identified and dealt with,"" IOM Italy mission head Federico Soda said in a statement.
A Doctors without Borders psychologist said in a video that she had spoken with the minors who left the ship and they said they had spent more than a year in detention, where they were abused and mistreated.

Two cases were more critical, she said. One boy was having trouble seeing because, he said, he had been locked up for a year in the dark. Another had a gunshot wound in the shoulder.

Businessman Banks, who bankrolled one of the main ""Leave"" campaigns in Britain's 2016 EU membership referendum, had called on his supporters to follow suit to pack Conservative ranks.
If May were to resign or be toppled, the party grass roots membership would have the final vote on electing her successor.
""Arron Banks has today joined the Conservatives to ensure he has a vote on the inevitable leadership contest,"" the Leave.EU group, which Banks chairs, tweeted on Thursday.
But a Conservative party spokesman later said in a statement: ""Arron Banks'... application for membership of the Conservative Party has not been approved.""
Last month, May unveiled plans to keep Britain linked to European Union mechanisms on issues such as customs, angering those who favor a clean break from the EU and its institutions.
May wants to lead the Conservative Party into the next general election, which is due in 2022, but she has faced continued rumors over how long she can survive since losing her parliamentary majority in a snap election last year. 
After three months of membership, Banks would become eligible to vote in any leadership contest the party might hold.
In such a contest, Conservative members are asked to pick from two candidates chosen by the party's elected Members of Parliament.

Conservative Party membership currently stands at over 124,000 people and is growing, Deputy Chairman James Cleverly said on Twitter on Aug. 22.

816,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2018 01:00PM ET</span>",German conservatives under fire over right-wing radicalism in Saxony,"By Madeline Chambers
BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives faced accusations on Thursday of ignoring the rise of far-right groups in the eastern German state of Saxony after an incident there involving an off-duty police employee at an anti-Islam rally.
Saxony's interior ministry confirmed on Wednesday that the police employee had attended a march by anti-Islam group PEGIDA last Saturday and had reported TV journalists covering the rally to police who detained them for 45 minutes.
Video footage showed a well-built man in sunglasses and a hat in the colors of the German flag confronting the crew, waving his hands at the camera, telling them not to film and reporting them to the police.
State premier Michael Kretschmer, a senior member of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), then appeared to defend the police action, tweeting: ""The only people who come across seriously in this video are policemen.""
At a time when Germany is struggling to integrate more than a million migrants, the incident has raised concern both about entrenched right-wing sympathies among the police, especially in the former Communist East, and about press freedom.
Speaking on a visit to the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, Merkel said the right to demonstrate must be fully ensured.
However, she added: ""Anyone who goes to a demonstration must expect that he will be recorded and observed by journalists. So there has to be freedom for journalists to work.""
""I want to express my explicit commitment to the freedom of the press,"" she told a news conference. 
A deputy leader of the Social Democrats (SPD), who share power with the CDU in the federal government, earlier accused Merkel's party of complacency. ""The CDU in Saxony has for decades denied or trivialized right-wing radical movements and violence,"" Ralf Stegner told Handelsblatt daily.
It has ""allowed right-wing thinking in Saxony not only to go unchallenged but also to be acceptable"", he said.
PRESS FREEDOM
German Justice Minister Katarina Barley, also from the SPD, said the events were ""very worrying"" and had to be quickly and comprehensively cleared up.
Kretschmer has since said he is a convinced defender of a free press.
Merkel's decision in 2015 to let in about a million migrants, many fleeing wars in the Middle East, has fueled support for far-right groups such as PEGIDA and the Alternative for Germany (AfD), now the main opposition party in parliament. 
Saxony, the cradle of the PEGIDA movement, is a stronghold for far-right sentiment. In last year's federal election, the AfD was the strongest party in the state, pushing Merkel's CDU into an embarrassing second place.
Kretschmer, who has criticized Merkel's migration policy, faces a tough challenge in next year's state election to hold Saxony for the CDU.

Neo-Nazis have a strong tradition in Saxony, especially in the capital, Dresden, where they gather every year on Feb. 13 to mark the Allied firebombing of the city in World war Two which killed 25,000 people and destroyed its baroque architecture.

Investigators launched the probe after Le Canard Enchaine satirical weekly reported that Nyssen and her husband had enlarged Actes Sud's Paris office without informing city and tax authorities.
The publishing house said in a statement that it would take ""all necessary action"" to bring its offices in line with building regulations.
Nyssen told journalists that Actes Sud's statement required no further comment and said that ""no company is above the law"".
Eager to keep sleaze from weakening his reform drive, President Emmanuel Macron has insisted that he would hold ministers to the highest ethical standards. 
Though government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux has said Nyssen fully enjoyed Macron's support, the investigation is an embarrassment for a minister in charge of setting standards for protecting historical buildings and other sites.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain sent back to Morocco 116 migrants who stormed the border fence at its Ceuta enclave in North Africa on Wednesday, an Interior Ministry spokesman said.
Hundreds attempted to get over the highly fortified border on Wednesday, and 118 made it to Spanish soil. Some of them threw a corrosive substance which left seven police officers with burns. 
Police identified the entire group and gave them legal and medical help before starting the process of expelling them, which the migrants accepted, the spokesman said, adding two will be allowed to stay because they are minors.
Footage from local broadcaster Faro TV showed men being escorted by Spanish police and officials in green uniforms onto a bus which then crossed the border back into Morocco. 
Five of the group were injured in the jump over the fence, which is topped with razor wire. Thursday's footage showed two were visibly limping while another walked with crutches. 
More than 3,800 migrants have crossed into Spain's territories on the Moroccan border so far this year, according to the U.N. refugee agency. That accounts for 14 percent of the total who arrived, mainly by sea, in Spain, making it the main destination for people seeking a better life in Europe.
Morocco agreed to take back the people under an agreement which dates from 1992 and under which Morocco must readmit citizens of third countries who have entered Spain illegally, if Spain requests this within 10 days of their arrival.
The spokesman said this provision has been used very rarely, and Morocco agreed to take them thanks to ""good bilateral relations"".
Spain has in the past drawn criticism from human rights groups for allowing some migrants to be immediately turned back to Morocco without first seeking to identify them and offer assistance. The rights groups argue that skipping the lengthier deportation procedures deprives people of the opportunity to claim asylum.
Last year, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the immediate return of sub-Saharan migrants who attempted to cross the border into Melilla, the Spanish enclave east of Ceuta, amounted to a collective expulsion of foreign nationals and breached the European Convention on Human Rights.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - A U.N. investigative team that will collect and preserve evidence of acts by Islamic State in Iraq that may be war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide started work this week, nearly a year after the Security Council created it. 
At last September's annual U.N. gathering of world leaders, the council unanimously adopted a British-drafted resolution - after a year of talks with Iraq - asking U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to create the team ""to support domestic efforts"" to hold the militants accountable.
U.N. experts had warned in June 2016 that Islamic State was committing genocide against the Yazidis in Syria and Iraq to destroy the minority religious community through killings, sexual slavery and other crimes.
Guterres notified the 15-member Security Council in a letter that the U.N. team, led by British lawyer Karim Asad Ahmad Khan, would start work on Aug. 20. 
Guterres announced in May that he had appointed Khan after the Security Council approved the scope and limitations for the team in February. He said in the letter, released on Thursday, that Khan visited Iraq earlier this month. 
Use of evidence collected by the team in other venues, such as international courts, would ""be determined in agreement with the Government of Iraq on a case-by-case basis."" Evidence is for primary use by Iraqi authorities, followed by ""competent national-level courts,"" according to the 2017 U.N. resolution.
International human rights lawyer Amal Clooney and Nadia Murad, a young Yazidi woman who was enslaved and raped by Islamic State fighters in Mosul, have long pushed Iraq to allow U.N. investigators to help.

Islamic State, which until last year controlled large areas in Syria and Iraq, has since been driven into the desert by successive defeats in offensives by international allies in both countries. The U.N. investigative team's mission does not include Syria.

GENEVA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's national security adviser John Bolton said on Thursday he had warned Moscow against meddling in the U.S. midterm elections in November during talks with the head of Russia's National Security Council.
Bolton said he had also raised with Nikolai Patrushev the issue of tightening economic sanctions against Iran and said they had discussed a phased withdrawal of Iran's presence in Syria, but gave no details.
""I made it clear we wouldn't tolerate (election) meddling in 2018 and that we were prepared to take necessary steps to prevent it from happening,"" Bolton told a news conference after more than five hours of talks with Patrushev in Geneva.
The United States has already imposed economic sanctions against Russia over its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Moscow denies the allegations.
Bolton said differences over the alleged meddling had prevented the two sides from issuing a joint final statement after the first high-level meeting of its kind since Trump met President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki in July.
In answer to a question, Bolton said that he had not raised the statement by  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) on Monday that hackers linked to Russia's government had sought to launch cyber attacks on U.S. political groups. He noted Microsoft was not a U.S. governmental institution. 
LINES OF COMMUNICATION 
""I think we made a lot of progress, we identified certain areas where lines of communication could be restored and more work done by the affected agencies - State Dept, Defense Department, other agencies as well,"" Bolton said.
Patrushev was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying they had broadly agreed to re-open communication lines between their respective foreign and defense ministries.
Bolton, one of the Trump administration's leading hawks in dealing with Iran's nuclear program, held talks with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem this week.
Bolton said on Thursday that following the U.S. decision to withdraw from a 2015 international deal aimed at curbing Tehran's nuclear program, the Trump administration's objective was to ""put maximum pressure on the regime"" by making sanctions ""more extensive and more effective"".
Patrushev had not sought Russian waivers on sanctions during their talks, he added.
Commenting on Iran's role in Syria's long-running conflict, Bolton said: ""Our objective is that all Iranian forces return to Iran ... And we talked about a variety of ways in which it might be accomplished through a series of steps.""
Bolton, a critic of the New START treaty agreed during Democratic President Barack Obama's administration, said the two sides did not set a date for deciding what to do about the treaty due to expire in 2021.

""We are very very early in the process of considering what we are going to do with New START or the INF treaty,"" he said, referring to the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces pact.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - A Catholic conference on family issues that Pope Francis is due to address this weekend heard a plea from a U.S. priest on Thursday for the Church to welcome gay members, who he said had been made to feel like lepers. 
At the first major speech on the issue at the World Meeting of Families, which is organized by the Vatican every three years and is being held in Dublin this year, U.S. Jesuit priest James Martin told delegates that excluding lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Catholics violated the teachings of Jesus Christ.
""Let your LGBT brothers and sisters know that you stand with them... Be courageous,"" Martin told about 1,000 delegates, before listing concrete steps for priests to take to welcome gay parishioners. 
""By excluding LGBT Catholics, you are breaking up God's family,"" he added. 
The Church teaches that homosexual tendencies are not sinful but homosexual acts are, and that homosexuals should try to be chaste.
""WHO AM I TO JUDGE?""
In 2013 Pope Francis, who arrives in Dublin on Saturday for a two-day visit, said the Church should seek forgiveness from homosexuals for the way they had treated them. ""If a person is gay and seeks the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge,"" he said. 
Martin was criticized by Vatican clerics for his 2017 book ""Building a Bridge"", in which he argued for the Church to better engage with the LGBT community. 
Organisers of the Dublin conference have been accused of excluding LGBT groups after the Global Network of Rainbow Catholics and We are Church Ireland said they had failed to receive responses to requests to have stands at the event. 
A conference spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment but was quoted by The Times Ireland as saying that space was limited and preference had been given to groups that met certain criteria. 
Members of gay-rights groups protesting outside the conference said Martin's speech was a hollow gesture. 
""There are a lot of nice words being spoken, but in reality nothing really changes on the ground,"" said Jim O'Crowly, a 77-year-old gay man who said he attends Catholic Mass every week.
""If they want to do something, they should start by changing the very offensive language that is in Church teaching about homosexuality, regarding it as being disordered and intrinsically evil."" 
Martin in his speech gave a list of steps that priests could take to help LGBT Catholics in their parishes feel more welcome, including referring to them in sermons as full members of the community, asking them about their experiences and organizing LGBT events. 

Martin told Reuters it was the first time the phrase LGBT had been used officially at the Catholic Conference. He also said there has been ""great progress"" on the issue in recent years, firstly because of Pope Francis' attitude and secondly due to a growing number of Catholics coming out as gay.

No specific charges had yet been laid against the men, but they were arrested on the orders of Egypt's public prosecutor, the sources said. Egypt's interior ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Egyptian authorities have jailed thousands of Sisi opponents and critics in recent years, including alleged Islamist militants and secular rights activists. The government says its actions are directed at terrorists and saboteurs trying to undermine the state.
The ex-diplomat and former ambassador, Masoum Marzouk, earlier this month called for a referendum on Sisi's government, questioning its popularity in rare public criticism.
He said the government's term should end and parliament be dissolved if a majority of Egyptians gave it a vote of no confidence.
The other two men arrested were Raed Salama, a senior member of the opposition Dignity Party which Marzouk used to belong to, and academic Yahya Kazaz, who recently called for Sisi's departure on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, writing ""resistance is the solution"".
Prior to Sisi's landslide re-election in March - in a vote where he was the only serious candidate - challengers were jailed or pulled out of the race citing intimidation. Security forces also detained several journalists and online critics in May.
Sisi's supporters say the crackdown on dissent is needed to stabilize Egypt after a 2011 uprising and the unrest that followed, including an Islamist insurgency in the Sinai Peninsula that has killed hundreds.
The former general became president in 2014, a year after he led the ouster of Islamist president Mohamed Mursi, Egypt's first freely-elected head of state, after popular protests against his rule.
Mursi came to power after the 2011 uprising that toppled Hosni Mubarak who had been president for nearly 30 years.

Human rights groups say that Hungarian authorities have refused food to some asylum seekers held in the two detention camps on the border, which are open towards Serbia, while they await the outcome of their court appeal.
Hungary's parliament in June passed laws that criminalize giving some kinds of help to illegal immigrants. Hungary also said it would not accept asylum applications from migrants arriving via a country where they are deemed safe from persecution or harm, or where an adequate level of protection is provided.
As all the asylum seekers have come via Serbia, which is classed by Hungary as a safe country, their applications can now be rejected. The European Commission says the changes do not comply with EU law and has launched a procedure against Hungary.
Rightwing nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been one of the strongest opponents of the EU's migration policy. 
Most migrants entering Hungary moved on to wealthier western European countries anyway. But Orban views them as a threat to Europe's Christian civilization and his anti-immigrant stance helped get him re-elected with a landslide in an April election.
The Helsinki Committee, a rights group, said in an Aug. 17 statement it had asked the Strasbourg-based ECHR to intervene over what it described as ""inhuman"" treatment on the border. 
It said Hungary's Immigration and Asylum Office had refused to provide food to migrants in the camps in order to dissuade them from pursuing court appeals and to return to Serbia.
""This amounts to inhuman treatment and an absurd legal situation,"" it said.
The ECHR, responding to emailed questions from Reuters, said it had asked Hungary to provide food for applicants in four cases during their stay in the detention centers.
The Immigration Office did not respond to emailed questions from Reuters. It was not immediately clear how many people were currently staying in the two detention centers.
Asked about the matter, the Hungarian government spokesman said the law stated that migrants whose asylum application has been rejected must leave the camps on the border.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - When Pope John Paul II made the first visit by a pontiff to Ireland in 1979, contraception and divorce were still illegal and the Catholic Church's influence on a deeply conservative society was near-total.
Pope Francis, who arrives in Dublin on Saturday for a two-day visit, will find an Ireland his predecessor would not have recognized as Catholic.
Ireland is now led by a gay prime minister. Three years ago, it became the world's first country to adopt gay marriage by popular ballot. Last May, it ended one of the West's strictest abortion regimes. Both referendums won by large majorities despite Church opposition.
And he will find a wounded Church whose once-absolute authority has been laid low by sexual abuse scandals.
Weekly Mass attendance was at about 80 percent 40 years ago. It's about 35 percent now, and last year only half of marriages were held in religious ceremonies in churches.
The rock that was once Irish Catholicism began crumbling in the late 1990s, with media investigations about the notorious Church-run, and government-backed, Magdalene Laundries, where ""fallen women"" were forced to work in slave-like conditions.
A series of official government inquiries between 2005 and 2014 exposed sexual abuse of minors by priests in various areas of Ireland. Church homes for unmarried mothers have been investigated for their treatment of children.
""When the pope arrives in Ireland this weekend, he will find a Catholic Church not just falling to ruin, but in some respects beyond repair,"" wrote Fintan O'Toole, a columnist for the Irish Times.
""He will be greeted with joy by the faithful, but few, even among them, will expect him to be able to fix an institution that has been shaken to its very foundations,"" he wrote.
A ""PERFECT STORM"" OF ABUSE CRISES
Francis could not be visiting Ireland at a worse time.
Recent sexual abuse crises in the United States, Chile, and Australia have reminded the Irish people of their scandals at home and fed escalating anger towards bishops who mishandled abuse cases.
One Vatican official called the combination ""a perfect storm"".
Last week, a grand jury in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania released the findings of the largest-ever investigation of sex abuse in the U.S. Church, finding that 301 priests in the state had sexually abused minors over the past 70 years.
The damning U.S. report has given Irish abuse victims and their advocates from around the world - some have flown into Dublin for the visit - fresh resolve to demand that the pope do more to root out sexual abuse in the Church.
""There are those who feel they can no longer trust our message, perhaps because they have been directly hurt and betrayed in their families by their experience of Church, or because the revelations of such heinous crimes have shocked them to the core,"" said Archbishop Eamon Martin, Ireland's most senior Church official.
The main purpose of the pope's trip is to close a week-long international Catholic gathering on the theme of the family that takes place every three years in a different city.
In one sign of just how much sexual abuse has cast a shadow on a meeting that was to have concentrated on family themes, Martin delivered the gathering's keynote address in place of Cardinal Donald Wuerl of Washington D.C., who withdrew after he was criticized in the Pennsylvania report.
Abuse victims, their families and supporters will gather in another part of Dublin while the pope says Mass on Sunday. Many of them have called on him to do more than just hold a private meeting with a select group of survivors.
    A silent vigil will be held at the same time by locals in the western town of Tuam. Four years ago, an unmarked grave with the remains of hundreds of babies was found there, on the grounds of a former Church-run home for unwed mothers and their children, shocking the country once more.
One sign of the Church's waning influence, if any were needed, can be seen in Dublin's city center, where street vendors like Marion White are struggling to sell papal flags and T-shirts made especially for the visit.
""I worked here for the pope in 1979 and the country was electrified. It was an amazing event. Everyone was so cheery and happy,"" said White, who has worked the stall near Dublin's main thoroughfare of O'Connell Street since he was nine-years old.

""It's all changed now, with all that has happened,"" he said. ""There's a lot of controversy, and people are not afraid to say it to us.""

827,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2018 10:53AM ET</span>",Why no one thought to close Italy's crumbling bridge,"By Stefano Bernabei, Elisa Anzolin and Valentina Za
ROME/MILAN (Reuters) - People living under the Italian bridge that collapsed last week with the loss of 43 lives had known for years it was crumbling: pieces kept falling on their homes and cars.
A month earlier, residents met officials in charge of maintaining the bridge in Genoa to find out what was being done.
The 1.2km-long suspension bridge, part of a privately run motorway linking the port city with France, had been slowly eroding in the sea air for decades, requiring non-stop maintenance, but life had become intolerable for residents.
Annoyed that noisy round-the-clock work was interrupting their sleep, they voiced their frustration to two officials from motorway operating company Autostrade per l'Italia, according to a recording of the July 18 meeting made public by Genoa council.
No one, however, questioned the overall safety of the 51-year-old bridge, demonstrating a public trust in institutions that is common in northern Italy and has been shaken to the core by the disaster.
Having lived for decades in the bridge's shadow, witness to continual maintenance works, the residents seemingly never thought it would collapse.
Local politician Mauro Avvenente came closest to putting the big question at the meeting, asking, ""Have you done an estimate of the remaining life of this bridge?"" His query, lost among a barrage of questions, elicited no specific reply.
After the disaster, in which dozens of cars and trucks plunged into a river bed along with thousands of tonnes of concrete, Avvenente said everyone knew the bridge was in bad shape, adding: ""Every time I drove over it, I would accelerate.""
As long ago as the 1980s, according to pensioner Salvatore Lorefice, there was a form prepared for residents to claim compensation for damage to their cars from falling concrete.
The apparent failure of all parties to think of closing the bridge or limiting traffic is now among aspects of the disaster under investigation by Genoa prosecutors.
Asked if prosecutors suspected the motorway was considered too important to be closed as a precaution, investigator Paolo D'Ovidio said: ""It could be a personal viewpoint, but it's not part of the terms of the investigation.""
Italy's new populist government, which has accused the previous administration of weak oversight of Autostrade, said the bridge's importance likely led its predecessor to consider closure or traffic restrictions as an extreme last step.
The viaduct fed Genoa port, connected one side of the city to the other and was one of Autostrade's busiest toll roads.
""It's likely its importance led the previous administration to consider the idea of closure, even partial, as a last resort only,"" the infrastructure ministry said in a statement to Reuters. 
Former infrastructure minister Graziano Delrio did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
HEAVY CORROSION
Local resident Giusy Moretti, a residents' committee coordinator and among those evacuated from their homes after the disaster, said she and other residents trusted Autostrade when it said it was working to ensure the bridge's safety.
Did she ever think it might collapse? ""Never, never,"" she said. ""I heard this noise I will never forget, like really long thunder ... My daughter came out to me on the terrace and said, 'The bridge has collapsed!"". And I said, ""Which bridge?""
At the July meeting, Autostrade maintenance executive Mauro Moretti explained to residents how the sea air had eaten away at the structure, considered an avant-garde work of engineering and the pride of Genoa when it went up in the 1960s.
Moretti also spoke of a newly approved project to repair and strengthen the bridge, news that only appeared to deepen the gloom among residents weary of maintenance works. They did not press him on its condition, though some would later say that the bridge had shaken worryingly when trucks rumbled over it.
What they did not know was that by the time of the meeting, corrosion had already consumed 10-20 percent of some of the steel rods that held up the bridge's road surface, according to a February engineering report seen by Reuters.
The rods or stays suspended the roadway from a series of towering concrete pylons. In a peculiar feature of the design by late Italian engineer Riccardo Morandi, the rods were encased in concrete, making their deterioration detectable only by sophisticated scanning equipment.
The corroded stays have emerged as a focus of investigations into the disaster, which unfolded in heavy rain. Grainy cellphone footage appears to show one set of stays rupturing, sending a 200-metre section of roadway into the valley below.
In the report, prepared for the infrastructure ministry, experts briefly cited the corrosion in giving their blessing to Autostrade's plan to repair and bolster the viaduct. It gave no opinion on the overall safety of the bridge.
Asked why ministry officials had not asked for the bridge to be closed or traffic restricted, the ministry said the level of corrosion had not warranted restrictions.
Autostrade, part of the Milan-listed infrastructure group  Atlantia  (MI:ATL), declined to comment.
An earlier report, compiled last October for Autostrade by Milan's Politecnico university, also identified an ""anomaly"" in the way the corroded stays responded to vibrations caused by traffic, wind and other phenomena. The bridge carried a stream of heavy trucks hauling containers to and from Genoa's port.
The university and Autostrade declined to release the confidential report, excerpts of which were leaked to Italian media. But Stefano Della Torre, head of the university department that produced it, confirmed the main finding and said this study alone was not enough to determine if the bridge was at risk of collapse. More work was needed, he said.
""The fact that some of the stays were not working properly confirmed the opportunity of finally carrying out that work (to strengthen them). Further checks were necessary to understand how long one could take to do that,"" he added.
The ministry and Autostrade declined to comment on this report.
A TALE OF TWO BRIDGES
Last year, another bridge of a similar age, also designed by Morandi, was found to be crumbling outside the town of Agrigento in Sicily.
But here, an environmental group acting with the support of residents did not trust the state operator's assurances that the structure was safe. It took their concerns to local prosecutors, who opened an inquiry in March 2017.
The group, Mareamico, said state operator Anas had assured them the Agrigento viaduct was not at risk of collapse despite concrete flaking off its pylons. It sent prosecutors a video of the decaying pylons.
""The prosecutors opened an investigation and an hour later Anas closed the viaduct,"" said Claudio Lombardo, a representative for Mareamico in Agrigento.
An Anas spokesman denied the inquiry had forced it to shut the bridge. In a statement at the time, it said it had long planned to begin major maintenance works. Within a few months, a branch of the viaduct was reopened to light traffic only.
Agrigento's top prosecutor, Luigi Patronaggio, remembers things differently.
""We intervened, on the hypothesis that there was a danger the bridge could collapse,"" he said. ""We spoke with Anas, who sent their technicians who ascertained that the bridge was dangerous. On our suggestion therefore, Anas closed the bridge.""
In Genoa, investigating prosecutor D'Ovidio said no formal complaint had ever been lodged with the prosecutors' office demanding an inquiry into the state of the bridge.
As Genoa prosecutors now investigate whether anyone is criminally liable for the disaster, Rome has announced a safety audit of infrastructure nationwide, with particular attention to other ageing Morandi bridges.
Giancarlo Bilotti, professor of structural analysis at the University of Venice, said it would be tough to predict collapse in bridges that, like the Genoa one, were degraded but showed no obvious structural deformity.

""What are you going to do? Close down all our highway bridges?""

828,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2018 10:50AM ET</span>","Illusory to think Syrian refugees can return now, France says","PARIS (Reuters) - France dismissed on Thursday any suggestion that millions of Syrian refugees could start returning home, as urged by Russia, which backs President Bashar al-Assad.
Foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes von der Muhll said the conditions for a return have not been met, given Assad's treatment of those who have already gone home and a possible offensive on rebel territory in northern Syria.
In recent weeks Russia has called on Western powers opposed to the Syrian government to help refugees return home and aid reconstruction of areas under his control.
However, Von der Muhll cited a decree depriving refugees and internally displaced people of their properties, the instability of the country and cases of arrest and forced conscription of Syrians returning from Lebanon.
""To consider a return of the refugees is illusory, in the current conditions,"" she said.
The seven-year civil war has killed an estimated half a million people, driven 5.6 million out of Syria and displaced around 6.6 million within the country.
Most refugees are from the Sunni Muslim majority, and it is unclear whether Assad's Alawite-dominated government will allow all to return freely or whether they would want to. Sunnis made up the bulk of the armed opposition to Assad.
France, which backs the opposition, says it will not support reconstruction of areas under Assad's control until there is a negotiated political transition under U.N. auspices.
""This year has seen the largest movement of displaced people since the beginning of the conflict and ... the entire international community has warned of the risks of a major humanitarian and migratory crisis in the event of an offensive against the province of Idlib,"" Von der Muhll said.

The Idlib region, a refuge for civilians and rebels displaced from other areas of Syria as well as jihadist forces, was hit by air strikes and shelling last week, in a possible prelude to a full-scale government offensive.

The route was reinstated in the wake of a 2015 accord between western powers and Iran under which most international sanctions on Iran were lifted in return for curbs on the country's nuclear programme.
Three months ago however, President Trump withdrew Washington from the deal, blasting it as flawed and reimposing sanctions to choke Iran's economy and force it to renegotiate or change direction.
British Airways, which is owned by Spanish-registered IAG (LON:ICAG), said its last outbound flight from London to Tehran will be on Sept. 22 and the last inbound flight from Tehran will be on Sept. 23. 

""We are suspending our London to Tehran service as the operation is currently not commercially viable,"" the airline said in a statement.

Duterte said he had received a letter signed by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and Secretary of Defense James Mattis reaffirming Washington's ""strongest support"" for the Philippines' effort to modernize its military.
Duterte's disclosure follows advice last week from a visiting Pentagon official, Randall Schriver, against buying Russian weapon systems and platforms.
Philippine Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana was scheduled to meet his Russian counterpart this week about the possibility of buying Russian arms, local media said. 
The U.S. government's letter, which Duterte read during a military event in his hometown Davao, said the ""special relationship"" between the two countries ""will only grow stronger by increasing our dialogue and cooperation especially on security"".
The letter noted Manila's recent decision to procure Bell combat utility helicopters and Cessna utility aircraft. Bell and Cessna are both part of  Textron Inc  (NYSE:TXT). 
""We hope to partner in all the significant defense procurement,"" the U.S. officials were quoted as saying in the letter. 
The U.S. embassy in Manila did not immediately reply to Reuters' request for comment.
Duterte, however, said what he needed were attack helicopters and small planes for counter-insurgency operations. 
He expressed willingness to meet the three U.S. officials, but said he would not go to the United States for the dialogue.
Duterte has vowed to buy brand-new military equipment to fight twin Maoist and Muslim rebellions, and no longer accept second-hand weapons from the United States.
The Philippines under Duterte has forged closer ties with both China and Russia involving trade and defense cooperation.

Manila scrapped a deal to buy assault rifles from the United States after some U.S. legislators campaigned to block the sale, citing concerns over Duterte's bloody anti-narcotics campaign.

    A court document, dated Aug. 20 and seen by Reuters, showed Sambi and his associates also face charges linked to forgery and falsification of records.
    Mahamoud Ahamada, Sambi’s lawyer, told Reuters by phone that he had met Sambi since he was charged and he denies the accusations. “President Sambi will prove his innocence by defending himself against all the accusations that have been leveled against him,” Ahamada said. 
Sambi, who was in power from 2006 to 2011 and has been under house arrest since May, has previously denied all allegations against him. 
    The Comoros Islands began its program to sell passports in 2008 as a way of raising much-needed cash. But an investigation by the Comoros parliament released in March found that thousands of passports had been sold outside official channels via criminal networks and at least $100 million of revenues had gone missing.
    A Reuters investigation in June found that some of these passports had ended up being bought by Iranians, many of whom were involved in sectors that had been targeted by international sanctions in Iran.
    Said Larifou, a lawyer who launched a citizens initiative calling for a criminal investigation into the passport scandal, called the case being brought against Sambi historic. “It is the start of a victory for the hundreds of Comorian citizens who dared to call for justice,"" he told Reuters.
    ""The charging of former president Sambi, which will hopefully be followed by that of former president Ikililou (Dhoinine), are historic and defining legal steps in that they will no doubt help put an end to impunity,” Larifou said.
    Dhoinine, who succeeded Sambi in 2011, has been questioned but not charged in relation to the passport program.
    The court document also said Sambi had abused his relative freedom while under house arrest to contact others who were involved in the scheme, then pressure them to hide evidence in order to undermine the investigation.
In a statement issued on Thursday, Sambi’s JUWA party repeated accusations that the parliamentary report on the citizenship program was flawed and the case against Sambi was aimed at neutralising critics of the current government.

MINA, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - More than two million haj pilgrims headed back to Mecca for final prayers on Thursday as organizers said the world's largest annual gathering of Muslims had gone smoothly in the face of political tensions and huge logistical challenges.
Senior Saudi officials said the rituals - which have been marred in the past by deadly stampedes, fires and riots - had passed without incident.
Mecca province governor Prince Khaled al-Faisal, who heads the central haj committee, said staff had used new technologies to run the massive event.
Pilgrims were given electronic bracelets this year to help manage the flow of people through the sites.
""We aspire to (have) a smart haj by using technology in all future activities,"" he told reporters in Mina, east of Mecca. ""The development of the holy sites, which will be implemented soon, depends entirely on technology and rapid communication.""
Thousands of worshippers participated in a symbolic stoning of the devil, part of the haj rituals, in Jamarat before returning to Mecca where the Grand Mosque filled with worshippers preparing to depart.

Saudi Arabia stakes its reputation on its guardianship of Islam's holiest sites - Mecca and Medina - and its organization of the pilgrimage. It is hoping to expand attendance to help build its tourism industry.
""A GREAT BLESSING""
More than 2.37 million pilgrims came this year, most of them from abroad, for the five-day ritual. Attendance is a religious duty, once in a lifetime, for every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it.
""I feel I am born once again,"" said Egyptian pilgrim Sabah Saeed, 49. ""This is a great blessing from God and it makes you so happy.""
More than 110,000 members of the security forces and 32,000 health workers were on hand this week to maintain safety and provide first aid, said organizers.
Saudi Health Minister Tawfiq al-Rabeeah said the pilgrimage had passed without any outbreak of disease, a perennial concern.
A crush in 2015 killed nearly 800 pilgrims, according to Riyadh, when two large groups of pilgrims arrived at a crossroads east of Mecca. Counts by countries of repatriated bodies showed over 2,000 people may have died, including more than 400 Iranians.
Saudi authorities said at the time that the crush may have been caused by pilgrims failing to follow crowd control rules, and King Salman ordered an investigation but the results were never announced.
Asked about the probe on Thursday, Prince Khaled told reporters it was not within his purview, without specifying which government entity is handling it.
Some 86,000 Iranians attended haj this year amid a diplomatic rift between Tehran and Riyadh, which are locked in a struggle for regional supremacy. Their dispute was exacerbated by the 2015 crush.

Around 300 pilgrims came from Qatar, which is locked in a year-old diplomatic row with Saudi Arabia over alleged support for terrorism, which Qatar denies.

(Reuters) - Former U.S. intelligence contractor Reality Winner, who pleaded guilty to illegally leaking to a media outlet a top secret report on Russian interference in U.S. elections, was due to be sentenced on Thursday in Georgia.
The 26-year-old, who has spent nearly two years in jail, was accused of passing a National Security Agency report to The Intercept in 2016. She initially denied the charges but in June changed her plea to guilty.
Her attorneys have requested a prison sentence of 63 months followed by three years of supervised release, arguing that it was ""more than sufficient to satisfy the goals of sentencing,"" court documents showed. 
An attorney for Winner would not comment on Thursday when asked about the sentencing hearing, which is due to take place at 10 a.m. ET in federal court in Winner's hometown of Augusta, Georgia.
Winner had been working with Pluribus International Corp, a company that provides analytical services for U.S. defense and intelligence agencies.
The NSA document she gave the news outlet offered technical details on what it said were Russian attempts to hack election officials in the United States and a voting-machine company before the presidential election in November 2016, two U.S. officials with knowledge of the case have said.
Winner was indicted on a single federal count of willful retention and transmission of national defense information, a felony under the Espionage and Censorship Act that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.
A federal judge ordered that she be held without bond after prosecutors said she posed a flight risk and public danger, citing what they called ""disturbing"" comments in her notebook.
In one section she wrote: ""I want to burn the White House down,"" according to prosecutors, who said investigators also found the names of three Islamic extremists known to federal authorities listed in Winner's notebook.

Winner admitted to intentionally printing a copy of the intelligence report in her office and mailing it to the news organization, court documents showed. The government did not allege that she sought to share the report with foreign agents.

""There is no work or salary so we can't afford transportation costs, and the village helped me with the payments for treatment and to take her there,"" he said as a doctor tended to his mother, who had visible swelling in one arm.
Millions of Yemenis are at risk from hunger and cholera brought on by three years of war, an emergency that has also hit cancer patients, struggling to get treatment in a country where the economy and infrastructure have collapsed.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said around 35,000 people have cancer in Yemen, with about 11,000 cases diagnosed each year.
""It is very difficult to find medicines, and if you find them in the market, they're too expensive and citizens cannot afford them,"" said Mohammed Al-Emad, accompanying a relative going for treatment in the capital Sanaa.
Yemen is embroiled in a war between a Saudi-led military coalition and the Iranian-aligned Houthi group. The fighting has crippled its economy and healthcare system, and unleashed the world's most urgent humanitarian crisis with millions facing starvation and diseases such as cholera, diphtheria and malaria.
The Saudi-led alliance has imposed stringent measures on maritime trade to Yemen in an effort to choke off arms supplies to the Houthis, who still control the most populous areas of the country including Sanaa. But the measures have also slowed the flow of desperately needed aid supplies.
The National Oncology Centre in Sanaa admits around 600 new cancer patients each month. But it received only $1 million in funding last year from state entities and international aid groups, the head of the center, Ahmed al-Ashwal, told Reuters.
The few beds available at the center are reserved for children. Other patients receive treatment intravenously, while sitting on dilapidated recliner chairs or in the waiting area.
The WHO said that prior to the conflict, the center used to receive $15 million a year from the state and that the budget was used to purchase chemotherapy medications and anti-cancer drugs for oncology centers across the country.
""Now, the National Oncology Centre is totally relying on the fund provided by international organizations, including WHO, and some charitable organizations or businessmen as the government fund has been disrupted for around two years,"" it said in a statement emailed to Reuters.
The head of the Al-Amal Centre for Cancer Treatment, Yasser Abdullah Noor, said the center is struggling to provide care to its more than 5,300 patients in Hodeidah and was in danger of shutting down without government support.
""A center that provides care to thousands of patients cannot operate on donations and grants alone.""

LONDON (Reuters) - British companies trading with the European Union will face a tangle of red tape and possible delays at the border if the government fails to negotiate an exit deal before Britain leaves the bloc, official papers showed on Thursday. 
Britain's Brexit minister Dominic Raab said he remained confident the two sides would reach a deal, but set out in a series of notes what could change without one, including more paperwork for trade and more costly credit card payments when ordering EU products. 
With little more than seven months to go until it leaves the EU on March 29, Britain has yet to reach an agreement with the bloc on the terms of its departure. Prime Minister Theresa May's plan for a ""business-friendly"" deal has failed to impress negotiators in Brussels and has been heavily criticized at home.
""We have a duty, as a responsible government, to plan for every eventuality,"" Raab said. ""To do this, we need to have a sensible, responsible and realistic conversation about what a no deal situation really means in practice.""
The government's guidelines make it clear that companies trading with Europe would face new customs and excise rules and require paperwork covering customs and safety declarations in the event of no deal. 
If Britain left the EU in March 2019 without a deal ""the free circulation of goods between the UK and EU would cease,"" the guidance said.
As a result, the government is working with industry to stockpile medicines for six weeks above normal operational supplies. This is one of the most vulnerable areas of trade due to the uncertainty about how drug oversight will function if Britain leaves the pan-European medicines regulatory system abruptly. 
""These papers show that those who claim crashing out of the EU on World Trade Organisation rules is acceptable live in a world of fantasy, where facts are not allowed to challenge ideology,"" business lobby group the CBI said. 
Although import Value Added Tax on goods will not have to be paid upfront under a new ""postponed accounting"" rule, UK recipients of expensive parcels from EU businesses will have to pay tax in line with current rules for non-EU countries.
Raab said the vast majority of consumers would not immediately be affected, but the government paper on banking said Britons will have to pay more to make card payments in the EU and businesses on the continent could be cut off from investment banks in London if there is a no-deal Brexit. 
More than a million Britons living abroad may not be able to access their UK bank accounts to receive pensions and salaries, the document said. 
POLITICAL FURORE
Plans to release the technical notes were first announced in July, bringing accusations that the government was scaremongering to quell growing calls from pro-Brexit campaigners in May's Conservative Party to walk away from negotiations. 
That was followed by a backlash from political opponents who said it depicted a government in chaos.
The furor underlines the fragility of May's position, heading into the final phase of negotiations without unity in her party, a clear consensus in parliament on what type of exit Britain should seek and persistent disagreements with Brussels.
One of the main outstanding issues is the Irish border, which the no deal papers failed to address, simply repeatedly saying the government would ""take full account of the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland"" in its no-deal planning. 
In total around 80 technical notices are expected over the coming weeks. They will be closely scrutinized by industry to see how well prepared Britain is for an outcome many employers have warned will be hugely disruptive.
The government has maintained throughout the negotiation process that it is preparing for all possible outcomes. Tackling some of the media reports that had preceded the release of the papers, Raab sought to reassure Britons that the army would not be called in to distribute food. 
Several ministers have warned that the risk of leaving without an agreement has increased. Earlier this month trade minister Liam Fox put the chances at 60-40. 
Many economists say failure to agree exit terms would seriously damage the world's fifth-largest economy as trade with the EU, Britain's largest market, would become subject to tariffs.
Supporters of Brexit say there may be some short-term pain for the economy but that long-term it will prosper when cut free from the EU.

The opposition Labour party's Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer said the talks with the EU were ""going badly"" and the publication of the documents on how to prepare for a no deal is a sign the government is ""moving into panic mode"".

838,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2018 07:51AM ET</span>","Imitate Vaxjo? As heat rises, Swedish city goes green - and thrives","By Alister Doyle, Environment Correspondent
VAXJO, Sweden (Reuters) - Ringed by forests in southern Sweden, the city of Vaxjo is thriving even as it cuts greenhouse gas emissions at rates more typical of economic crashes in recessions or wars.
It is a radical example of tackling climate change by cutting the use of fossil fuels, offering a glimpse of how the world could stay within warming limits which U.N. scientists say are needed to avoid significant environmental damage.
Vaxjo's power plant runs on biomass from timber. In winter, snow plows clear bicycle paths before roads to discourage cars, and political parties all back a target of making the city fossil-fuel free by 2030 to eliminate carbon dioxide emissions from oil, natural gas and coal.
Around the world, governments are struggling to meet their various pledges to cut emissions under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, amid unease about heat waves, droughts, and wildfires that have raged this summer from Greece to California.
Leading climate scientists are set to warn governments in October that global carbon emissions from energy use will have to plunge by up to seven percent a year to meet Paris' toughest goals - unless they develop technologies to suck carbon from the air, according to a draft U.N. report obtained by Reuters.
Extreme falls are usually known only from World Wars, the 1930s Great Depression or in Russia, where emissions plunged 16 percent in the year after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.
Coal-dependent emerging economies led by China and India are all raising energy use to end poverty and developed countries are wary of sacrificing growth for the environment.
What works in a city in a rich, stable Nordic democracy is not an easy blueprint.
Still, isolated examples like Vaxjo, a city of 66,000 inhabitants where the twin-spired red medieval cathedral contrasts with ultra-modern wooden buildings, are intriguing for policymakers since it has cut emissions and continued to grow.
ADVICE
Bo Frank, president of the city council and an architect of the green shift, said his advice boiled down to: ""Heavy, heavy tax increase on fossil energy and reduce the tax on all kinds of renewable energy.""
Per capita, Vaxjo says carbon dioxide emissions have fallen by 58 percent from 1993-2016, to 1.9 tonnes from 4.5, while local gross domestic product (GDP) rose 32 percent from 1993-2014, according to the latest available figures.
The trajectory is uneven, but equates to an annual rate of emissions cuts of 3.7 percent with 1.33 percent growth.
By contrast, worldwide carbon emissions rose by two percent last year to a record high of almost five tonnes per capita, according to scientists who compile a Global Carbon Budget.. 
Vaxjo aims to eliminate carbon emissions from fossil fuels by 2030 - in homes, industry and transport including planes taking off from the local airport. It says its accounting follows U.N. guidelines, treating the municipality as if it were a mini-country.
The city estimates that carbon dioxide from fossil fuels accounts for 65 percent of the municipality's greenhouse gases. Vaxjo has cut other gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide, by 42 percent since 1993 but has not yet set deadlines for phasing them out.
Thanks to the early green start, Vaxjo's carbon cuts are far ahead of the timetable set by almost 200 nations in the Paris climate agreement to phase out net emissions of all greenhouse gases sometime from 2050-2100.
Sweden as a whole has also cut emissions while sustaining strong economic growth. The country of 10 million tops international environmental rankings and imposes the world's highest carbon tax, of up to 137 euros ($158.84) a tonne.
CARBON TAXES
""The notion that a carbon tax is harmful for the economy in any country is a political notion. Not a factual notion,"" said Swedish Environment Minister Karolina Skog, of the Green Party. 
The burning of biomass also emits carbon dioxide but can be made carbon neutral by planting new forests, as in Vaxjo, which absorb the gas to grow. 
Almost no countries have forests covering two-thirds of the country like Sweden, but Skog noted that all nations have some form of renewable energy, such as solar or wind power.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) says Sweden produces $11.13 of GDP for every kilo of carbon emissions, almost three times the average for rich nations of $3.91.
Skog cited companies like flat-pack furniture group IKEA, which aims to be ""climate positive"" by 2030, to show that strong environmental goals do not undermine profits but said ""we have not yet completely decoupled our economy from carbon emissions"".
The nation's greenhouse gas emissions fell 26 percent between 1990-2016, but the rate of decline has slowed in recent years; Rolf Lindahl of Greenpeace said Sweden was doing better than most but not enough in terms of phasing out fossil fuels.
Wildfires have made the environment a big issue in elections due on Sept. 9, with most parties pledging tougher action on climate change.
The anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats, who oppose Sweden taking a global lead in cutting greenhouse gas emissions because of fears it could slow the economy, are expected to make the biggest gains with an expected fifth of the vote. But mainstream parties on left and right have ruled out cooperating with them. 
The Paris agreement set a goal of limiting the rise in average global temperatures to ""well below"" two degrees Celsius (3.6F) above pre-industrial times, while ""pursuing efforts"" for 1.5 (2.7F). Temperatures are already up by about 1C.
As part of the Paris deal, world leaders asked scientists to write a report about ways to achieve the 1.5C goal, a goal that many experts say is unrealistic.
The draft by the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to be unveiled in South Korea in October, acknowledges ""there is no documented historical precedent"" to limit warming to 1.5C but outlines four possible ways to do it.
Three rely heavily on unproven technologies for extracting carbon dioxide from nature and burying it. A ""low energy demand"" (LED) scenario is the only one to focus solely on rapid cuts in emissions and an acceleration of planting forests to absorb more greenhouse gases.
Arnulf Gruebler, of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Vienna, the lead author of the LED, said the rise of the internet in recent years showed that new technologies can abruptly transform economies.
Smart phones, for instance, could reduce energy demand if they replace cameras, radios, telephones, clocks, televisions and music players rather than being an extra gadget. 
But many say the LED scenario is also pie-in-the-sky.
Christian Azar, a professor of energy and the environment at Chalmers University in Gothenburg, said it would probably require unpopular restrictions on driving, flying, even diets.
""I don't think that's going to happen,"" he said.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who says he doubts climate change is primarily driven by man-made emissions, plans to pull out of the Paris agreement, asserting that it will undermine the economy.
INTERNET
So far, the deepest national cuts in emissions delivered by peacetime policies, according to a study in the journal Nature Climate Change, were 4.5 percent a year in Sweden from 1976-86 after oil price spikes drove the nation to adopt nuclear power.
Spurred by the oil shocks, Vaxjo was one of the first Swedish cities to build a district heating plant run on biomass in 1980, pumping hot water around the city and generating electricity.
After the oil crises ""we realized we live virtually in the woodshed,"" said Henrik Johansson, environmental coordinator at Vaxjo municipality. ""It was a win-win."" 
Local forest owners producing timber earned extra money from selling waste branches, sawdust and bark to fuel the new power plant. The forest owners then paid more taxes, enriching the municipality.
Overall, Sweden's green shift was eased by a lack of a strong oil or coal lobby, even though it does have a big, energy-dependent steel industry and car makers such as Volvo.
In Vaxjo, buses run on biogas, bus routes are altered to stop at new housing developments even before they are built and changes to building codes are being planned to limit new parking spaces.
The city is also upgrading insulation in older buildings and has decreed that 50 percent of all new municipal buildings will be made of wood by 2020. An urban garden near the center grows tomatoes, squash, pumpkins and sunflowers.
Sweden's local municipalities have huge power, raising taxes and spending about 70 percent of all public money on everything from education to pensions.
""In Sweden we have very high taxes and we are also the most decentralized country in the world. So what I say happens,"" said Mayor Anna Tenje, of the ruling mainstream conservative Moderate Party.
It is not always popular. Frank, president of the city council, said Vaxjo's strong line on the environment had led a satirical newspaper to describe him as the head of a ""green fascist state"".
And not everything is on track. Gleaming new bicycle racks for commuters at Vaxjo railway station were mostly empty one recent day.
Tenje said the biggest headache was persuading people in rural areas to forsake cars run on diesel or gasoline, making the fossil-free goal hard to reach.
""We will achieve the goal but maybe it won't be by 2030,"" she said. ""Maybe it will take until 2035.""

TRAPPES, France (Reuters) - A man with psychiatric problems fatally stabbed his mother and sister in the Paris suburb of Trappes on Thursday and seriously wounded a third person, French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said.
The 36-year-old launched his attack in a street in broad daylight before taking refuge in a house. He was shot dead by police when he ran towards them in a threatening way, the minister said.
""It appears the criminal had serious psychiatric problems,"" Collomb told reporters in Trappes. 
""He was known (to police) for advocating terrorism but it seems he was a disturbed person rather than someone who could respond to calls for action from terrorist organizations like Daesh,"" he said, using the Arabic acronym for Islamic State.
Collomb said counter-terrorism prosecutors were not at this stage in charge of the investigation but were following it closely.
Trappes is a low-income town located in Paris' affluent western suburbs. Dozens of radicalized youths from the town of about 30,000 habitants have left for Syria. 
Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in his first purported speech in nearly a year, called on followers to fight on despite battleground defeats, according to an audio recording posted on the group's media outlet on Wednesday.
Islamic State swiftly claimed responsibility for the attack but provided no evidence of a link to the knifeman. 

BFM TV said the attacker shouted ""Allahu Akbar"", but police could not confirm this, and they said investigators were looking into whether this was a family quarrel.

LONDON (Reuters) - Net migration of European Union citizens into Britain fell to its lowest level since 2012 in the year to March, but this was more than outweighed by a record influx of non-EU citizens ahead of Brexit, official data showed on Thursday.
The Office for National Statistics said 87,000 more EU citizens moved to Britain than left it during the year to March 2018, down from 123,000 a year ago, marking the lowest net migration figure since the year ending in December 2012.
Net migration of EU nationals into Britain has fallen markedly since voters, many motivated by a desire to reduce immigration, opted to leave the bloc in a June 2016 referendum.
Business groups, however, worry that companies will find it harder to hire the staff they need.
""These figures are nothing to celebrate, and given businesses are facing record skills gaps at every level it's disappointing to see the decline in people from Europe coming here to work,"" Jane Gratton, head of business environment and skills at the British Chambers of Commerce, said.
Thursday's data showed more EU nationals from the eight east European countries that joined the EU in 2004 left Britain than entered for the first time in records dating back 10 years.
Romanians and Bulgarians -- who have only had an unrestricted right to work in Britain since 2014 -- accounted for more than half of net EU migration to Britain. 
Overall net migration into Britain rose to 271,000 in the year to March, up 28,000 on a year ago.
That reflected net migration of 235,000 non-EU nationals -- a record high. 
But the ONS said that ""an unusual pattern of non-EU student immigration"" had affected the figures for the year to March 2017, making meaningful comparisons with the latest year difficult.
""Longer-term trends should instead be considered,"" the ONS said. Net migration of non-EU nationals into Britain has been on a steadily rising path since the year ending December 2015.

Britain's government has said it is committed to bringing net migration into Britain down to the tens of thousands.

AMSTERDAM/GENEVA (Reuters) - Former war crimes prosecutor David Crane, an American who was named only last month to lead a U.N. investigation into violence in Gaza this year, has resigned, the United Nations said.
The U.N. said in a statement dated Aug. 22 that Crane had informed the Human Rights Council of his decision a day earlier, ""due to a personal circumstance that has arisen"" and that the Council was ""considering next steps"".
Crane, a former senior U.S. legal official who served as chief prosecutor of the Special Court for Sierra Leone in 2002-2005, was named chair of the three-person inquiry on July 25. 
He could not be immediately reached for comment on Thursday. 
At least 170 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli army in what it has called border protection during weekly protests that began in late March. One Israeli soldier has been killed.
The U.N. Human Rights Council voted in May to set up the investigation into the killings. Israel said it was being demonized and that the inquiry was intended to undermine its right to self-defense.
Crane, recently retired as a Syracuse University professor, worked for decades for the U.S. government, including as senior inspector general in the Department of Defense. When chief prosecutor of the Special Court for Sierra Leone he indicted the then Liberian leader Charles Taylor for war crimes.

850,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2018 05:40AM ET</span>",'Trump-esque' former cop Dutton eyes Australia PM role,"By Jonathan Barrett and Erin Cooper
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Peter Dutton, who has launched a challenge to become Australia's prime minister, is a polarizing former police officer who forged a hard-line reputation enforcing tough immigration policies and making unpopular cuts to the health budget.
Dutton has emerged in recent months as the leader of the Liberal Party's conservative faction, which has become increasingly frustrated by a slide in opinion polls under the leadership of Malcolm Turnbull, an urbane former merchant banker.
While winning plaudits from the right for preventing asylum seekers arriving by boat to Australia, Dutton has been criticized by the left for comments about the rise of African gangs in Australian cities and for boycotting a government apology to Indigenous people in 2008. 
A Dutton-led government would likely move Australia's politics closer to those of U.S. President Donald Trump, with tax cuts and tariffs among his priorities, independent economist Saul Eslake said. 
""He might be Trump-esque, not only pursuing tax cuts, and possibly unfunded tax cuts at that, but he will likely be more protectionist as well,"" Eslake told Reuters.
In one of his first articulated policies, Dutton said this week he would exclude household electricity bills from Australia's goods and services tax. He also supports a reduction in corporate tax rates.
Dutton has had prominent roles in expanding the security and surveillance powers of state in his role heading the powerful Home Affairs ""super ministry"".
""He would be more populist but more inclined to big governments,"" Eslake said. 
Dutton's bid to become the country's 30th prime minister comes amid a tumultuous time in Australian politics. 
A prime minister has not served a full parliamentary term in Australia in a decade, with leaders routinely being sacked by their parties amid poor polling. 
Despite narrowly beating Dutton in a party-room vote earlier in the week, Turnbull said he will hold a second leadership vote on Friday if the majority of Liberal MPs sign a petition supporting the move.
But the leadership issue is complicated by questions over Dutton's eligibility to sit in parliament. 
Dutton, who denies there is any question over eligibility, is the beneficiary of a family trust with interests in childcare centers that receive government subsidies. Federal politicians are banned from benefiting financially from the government.
Turnbull said on Thursday the government's chief lawyer would advise on Dutton's eligibility on Friday morning.
If Dutton has the numbers to force a vote, Turnbull said he would not contest. Other lawmakers, including Treasurer Scott Morrison and Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop, could also challenge for the top job.
SWING STATE 
The son of a bricklayer, Dutton grew up in the northern suburbs of Brisbane, the state capital of Queensland, a politically important region full of tightly-contested electorates that often determine the outcome of federal elections.
The 47-year-old, who is counting on strong support among his Queensland colleagues to unseat Turnbull, holds the seat of Dickson with a paper-thin 1.6 percent margin. 
""Anything different is good; it would be a change for the better,"" said Colin Grant, who runs a shoe repair store in the electorate of Dickson. 
""He'd run the country well. People here agree with his policies."" 
A general election is due by May 2019 at the latest and Dutton would face an opposition Labor Party riding high.
A poll by market research company Roy Morgan on Wednesday found Opposition leader Bill Shorten would be preferred prime minister in a head-to-head contest with Dutton, by a margin of 59 percent to 36.5 percent, while 4.5 percent undecided.
LITTLE KNOWN 
Despite a ministerial career spanning over a decade, Dutton is not widely known around the country, said Ian McAllister, professor of Political Science at Australian National University in Canberra.
""He's only been Immigration Minister recently, and that's not a particularly good portfolio as they tend to be known for making hard decisions about asylum seekers and refugees, rather than delivering good economic news, so he doesn't have a high profile.""
Internationally, Dutton is best known for his hardline stance on immigration including the enforcement of Operation Sovereign Borders, a controversial policy that places asylum seekers arriving by boat in offshore detention centers.
He has, however, strongly supported some persecuted groups, including advocating for an increase in the number of Iraqi ethnic minority Yazidis to settle in Australia. 
Earlier this year, Dutton was criticized by the South African government after he suggested white farmers were being persecuted and deserved protection with special visas from a ""civilized country"".
Dutton has held a variety of ministerial roles since 2004, including the prominent health portfolio, where he regularly sparred with the medical association over funding. Dutton repeatedly warned of the ""spiraling costs"" of healthcare and sought reform.
Dutton unsuccessfully tried to introduce a A$7 ($5.12) fee a doctor visit for patients who would normally draw on Australia's universal health insurance system and avoid out-of-pocket expenses.
The government eventually scrapped the unpopular measure.
""If his record is repeated as Prime Minister, I shudder at the consequences for the vulnerable in our community,"" physician and former Australian Medical Association vice president Stephen Parnis said on Twitter on Thursday. 
In 2008, when then Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd delivered the formal apology to Indigenous people for past mistreatment, Dutton was the only Liberal cabinet minister to boycott the event - an act he has since said he regrets.
Rudd tweeted on Thursday that Dutton's boycott should disqualify him from the country's top political office.
""A grown man, experienced politician who knew what he was doing - sending a dog-whistle to racist sentiment,"" Rudd tweeted.

Israel captured much of the Golan from Syria in a 1967 war and annexed it, in a move not endorsed internationally. In May, a senior Israeli official said that U.S. recognition could be forthcoming within months.
But in a Reuters interview during a visit to Israel this week, U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton said ""there's no discussion of it, no decision within the U.S. government"".

CANBERRA (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull stubbornly clung to power on Thursday as senior ministers deserted him, saying he would hold a second leadership vote on Friday only if he received a letter signed by a majority of ruling party members.
Former home affairs minister Peter Dutton narrowly lost a challenge against Turnbull on Tuesday and has declared he would again contest a Liberal party leadership vote, while media reported the treasurer and foreign minister will also be candidates if a vote is called.
Key Turnbull supporter Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said Turnbull no longer had majority party support and Dutton was now the best person to lead the government to the next election, due by May 2019.
Several ministers have tendered their resignations. The leadership crisis saw the government adjourn parliament on Thursday until September.
Turnbull said if he received a letter requesting a fresh vote with the signatures of 43 Liberal Party lawmakers, he would call a party meeting for midday Friday (0200 GMT). If a sc-called leadership spill motion was then passed, he would not stand in the vote. 
A leadership spill motion is a vote to declare the leadership of a political party vacant, allowing an open contest.
Australian media reported on Thursday that Treasurer Scott Morrison and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop would contest the top job if the spill motion is passed.
Morrison has been a Turnbull supporter, but has reportedly long held ambitions to be prime minister.
Bishop, foreign minister for almost five years, has been deputy leader of the Liberal Party since 2007.
Whoever emerges as the next prime minister will become Australia's sixth in less than a decade. None of them, including two stints for Labor leader Kevin Rudd, have served a full term.
""Australians will be rightly appalled by what they are witnessing in their parliament,"" Turnbull told reporters in Canberra.
The revolving political door has angered and frustrated voters and the business sector.
The uncertainty has clouded the outlook for investors who punished the Australian dollar , sending it 0.9 percent lower to $0.7283. The Aussie was the worst performing major currency on Thursday.
Australian shares (AXJO) are down more than 1.5 percent since the first leadership challenge this week.
""For everybody in the country what is happening in Canberra is disappointing and frustrating. Business likes certainty and confidence in what happens in the future. Anytime we see uncertainty like what is happening in Canberra it is not helpful,"" said Qantas CEO Alan Joyce.
LIBERAL SPLIT
Turnbull said the leadership crisis was an ""internal insurgency"" to move the Liberal party to the far right.
""A minority in the party room, supported by others outside the parliament, has sought to bully, intimidate others into making this change of leadership,"" he said.
""It's been described by many people ... as a form of madness.
Turnbull sought to raise doubts over Dutton's ability to continue sitting in parliament, with reports he has financial interests in daycare centers which receive government funding.
The constitution bans lawmakers benefiting from state funds.
Turnbull said he asked Australia's most senior legal officer to provide advice on Dutton's eligibility.
""I cannot underline too much how important it is that anyone who seeks to be prime minister of Australia is eligible to be a member of parliament,"" Turnbull said.
Adding pressure on rebel lawmakers, Turnbull said he would resign from parliament if he lost the leadership, threatening the government's one-seat majority.
Turnbull came to power in a party-room coup in September 2015. A social liberal and multi-millionaire former merchant banker, he has struggled to appeal to conservative voters and only narrowly won a general election in 2016.
The ruling Liberal-National coalition government has consistently trailed the opposition Labor party in opinion polls, but Turnbull has remained the voters' preferred prime minister over Labor leader Bill Shorten.
Shorten said the ""cannibalistic behavior"" over the Liberal leadership was eating the government alive. 

""Australia no longer has a functioning government,"" he told parliament.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Australia's consulate in the Indonesian city of Surabaya boosted security measures on Thursday after a social media post urged militants to ""kill"" its officials there.
The nation's Department of Foreign Affairs updated its travel advisory on Thursday, noting that Australian officials in Surabaya would not be attending an event at the Airlangga University in the city ""due to heightened security concerns"".
Two security sources in Indonesia, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the elevated security threat related to a social media posting that urged Indonesians in Surabaya and East Java province to ""Kill these Australian officials"".
""Australia is a member of the international coalition against Islamic State which massacred thousands of Muslims. Revenge the blood of Muslims,"" said the message, which was reviewed by Reuters and verified by officials as the source of concern.
One security source in Indonesia said the posting on the Telegram app, which later spread to other social media platforms, appeared to have originated in the Netherlands.
""It's not that credible,"" the source told Reuters in a message. ""(There is) no evidence of capability or anyone local responding to this message.""
Australia opened the consulate in Surabaya, Indonesia's second-biggest city, earlier this month.
In May, a series of suicide bombings in Surabaya killed about 30 people, including the attackers. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks, the worst in Indonesia for more than a decade.
Since then, Indonesian police have detained nearly 250 suspected militants and killed 21 others.
Indonesia, which has grappled with violent Islamist militancy for almost two decades, is currently hosting the Asian Games.
It has deployed 100,000 military and police to secure the games, which are being held in the capital Jakarta and the city of Palembang on Sumatra island.
Neither the threat on social media, nor the Australian advisory, said that the Asian Games was a target.
Even so, the advisory says the Australian government continues to ""receive information indicating terrorists may be planning attacks in Indonesia.""
The overall level of Australia's advice was not changed. It warns travelers to ""exercise a high degree of caution"" in Indonesia.

855,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2018 01:41AM ET</span>",India decision to decline foreign aid for flood relief draws criticism,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India will not accept relief assistance from foreign governments for the flood-ravaged state of Kerala, the government has said, following offers of aid from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.
The decision to decline foreign help drew criticism from the opposition which called for an end the suffering of the people of the southern state hit by the worst flooding in a century, which has killed hundreds of people.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has announced assistance of 6 billion rupees ($85 million), compared with a request from the state for at least 20 billion rupees.
Modi has promised more aid and his government said late on Wednesday that would come through ""domestic efforts"".
""The government of India deeply appreciates offers from several countries, including from foreign governments, to assist in relief and rehabilitation efforts after the tragic floods in Kerala,"" the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement.
""In line with the existing policy, the government is committed to meeting the requirements for relief and rehabilitation through domestic efforts.""
This week, the United Arab Emirates offered assistance of $100 million while Qatar offered $5 million. Many people from Kerala live and work in the Gulf. 
Torrential rain that began in Kerala on Aug. 8 killed 231 people, destroyed tens of thousands of homes, and washed away roads and bridges, leading to an estimated loss of at least 200 billion rupees ($2.85 billion).
The rain eased over the weekend as the focus of efforts turned to relief and rehabilitation from rescue.
The main opposition Congress party accused Modi of exacerbating the crisis by failing to come through with more aid and creating obstacles to foreign help.
""This decision is quite disappointing to the people of Kerala,"" Congress leader and former Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy wrote in a public letter to Modi.
""Rules should be such (that they) eradicate the sufferings of the people. If there exist any obstacle against the acceptance of foreign aid, kindly look into the matter seriously and bring suitable modifications."" 
The foreign ministry said the government would welcome contributions to the Prime Minister's Relief Fund and the Chief Minister's Relief Fund from foundations, Indians living abroad and from people of Indian origin.
Kerala’s Finance Minister Thomas Isaac said on Twitter the central government should compensate the state for refusing foreign aid.

856,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 11:02PM ET</span>","A year on, Rohingya still fleeing Myanmar for crowded camps","By Zeba Siddiqui and Antoni Slodkowski
BALUKHALI REFUGEE CAMP, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Hamida Begum fled her home in Myanmar to neighboring Bangladesh about two months ago with her husband, two-year-old son, and three-month-old baby. In the weeks before she left, her husband almost never slept at home out of fear of being arrested.
""He would climb on top of a tree and sit there the whole night, even if it was raining really hard,"" said the 18-year-old, wearing a yellow headscarf over a purple dress and sitting on the floor of her barren bamboo hut.
Hamida now lives on the edge of the world's largest refugee camp, one of the latest arrivals among some 700,000 Rohingya Muslims who have escaped an army crackdown that the United Nations has called ""a textbook example of ethnic cleansing"".
Though Myanmar says it is ready to take back the Rohingya, the continued outflow of refugees such as Hamida and her family underlines the lack of progress in addressing the crisis, a year on from the start of the offensive on Aug. 25, 2017.
The Rohingya exodus has threatened Myanmar's tense transition to democracy and shattered the image of its leader, Nobel peace prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, outside the country.
""The crisis has done enormous damage to Myanmar's standing in the world,"" said Richard Horsey, a former U.N. diplomat in the country and a political analyst.
Suu Kyi's government has rejected most allegations of atrocities made against the security forces by refugees. It has built transit centers to receive Rohingya returnees to western Rakhine state.
But stories brought by Hamida and other recent arrivals in Bangladesh - at least 150 people in August and nearly 13,000 since the beginning of the year - suggest the resolution of a crisis that enters its second year on Saturday remains distant.
Around half a dozen new refugees who spoke to Reuters said that, after months of struggle amid charred huts and empty villages, they were forced to abandon their homes out of fear of harassment or arrest by the security forces. They said they had been confined to their homes and pushed to the brink of starvation, unable to visit farms for work, markets and fishing ponds for food, or mosques to pray.
Myanmar says it did not provoke the crisis and its military launched a legitimate counterinsurgency operation in response to a violent campaign from within the Rohingya minority, who are mostly denied citizenship in the southeast Asian nation.
""It was a systematic activity by a group in order to get a citizenship for Bengali people,"" said Myo Nyunt, a spokesman for Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party.
Many in Buddhist-majority Myanmar refer to the Rohingya as ""Bengali"", which most in the Muslim minority regard as a derogatory term used to suggest they are interlopers from Bangladesh.
 
AFRAID TO LIGHT CANDLES
The massive influx of refugees has transformed the hills in southeastern Bangladesh into an endless sea of white, orange and blue tents. Residents are settling in for the long haul.
Near Hamida's hut, Rohingya men carry bricks, dig 4 meter-deep latrines, reinforce muddy slopes with sturdy soil, and mend fences for a new NGO-run school. Bits of wood, bamboo poles and tarpaulin sheets are spread across the area where many of the new arrivals are sent to build their shelters.
Hamida said around 5,000 Rohingya lived in her village in northern Rakhine until last August. When she fled about two months ago, she was among only 100 or so who had remained in the partly-burned hamlet.
Reuters was unable to independently verify Hamida's account, though relatives and neighbors present at the interview supported her version of events and offered additional details.
Hamida stayed because she could not afford to pay her way into Bangladesh. Months after the initial offensive, she said, the security forces frequently patrolled her village and sometimes arrested Rohingya men or grabbed them to do unpaid work at an expanding military camp nearby.
""In Myanmar, if my children start crying at night, I can't even light a candle because there is a complete blackout, and if the military see any light they come and arrest you,"" she said.
The UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, said in a report last week more than half of the new arrivals, ""reported that relatives remaining in Myanmar also plan to leave due to continued fears"".
""People tell us...they told me, that they feel like they're prisoners. They can't leave the house, the men can't go fishing, the curfew is so extreme, that there are only certain hours when you can light a fire,"" said Caroline Gluck, a UNHCR representative in the camps.
Suu Kyi's spokesman did not respond to repeated calls seeking comment. In a speech in Singapore on Tuesday, Myanmar's civilian leader said the country had made preparations for the repatriation of refugees, but that it was difficult to set a timeframe for when that might happen.
""The returnees have to be sent back by Bangladesh,"" she said. ""We can only welcome them at the border.""
NLD spokesman Myo Nyunt acknowledged that the ethnic and religious tensions that triggered the violence in Rakhine a year ago remained stark.

""The situation in the area hasn't changed within one year,"" he said. ""It will take time to be improved, live in harmony.""

857,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 08:53PM ET</span>",Venezuelans entering Ecuador illegally receive help to reach Peru,"QUITO (Reuters) - Some 250 Venezuelans who illegally entered Ecuador to join tens of thousands fleeing a crisis at home have won safe passage to the Peruvian border, a few days before Peru's government tightens its migration requirements.
Ecuadorean authorities said on Wednesday they had dispatched buses to take the migrants 840km from the Andean country's northern border with Colombia to the Huaquillas coastal crossing with Peru.
This year 423,000 Venezuelans have entered Ecuador through the Rumichaca border, many planning to continue south to find work in Peru. Alarmed, Ecuador last Saturday put in place rules requiring Venezuelans to show passports, rather than just national identity cards. Peru will do the same beginning on Saturday.
Hundreds of migrants who began traveling days ago by bus and on foot through Colombia from Venezuela before the policy change crossed the Rumichaca checkpoint on Tuesday. They set out to walk and hitchhike, often in freezing conditions, to Huaquilla.
Maly Aviles, a 26-year-old Venezuelan, spent days on the Ecuador-Colombia border waiting with friends for a solution before the buses arrived.
""There is no way back. To return to Venezuela is suicidal,"" she said.
Venezuela's economy has been in steep decline and there are periodic waves of protests against the socialist government of President Nicolas Maduro. Maduro argues that he is the victim of a Washington-led ""economic war"" designed to sabotage his administration through sanctions and price-gouging.
The chaos has forced many to flood across the borders in search of work, food and basic healthcare. This has stretched social services, created more competition for low-skilled jobs and stoked fears of increased crime.
The governor of Ecuador's northern Pichincha province said more transfers would be organized for Venezuelans in the coming days.

""The Venezuelans have taken the decision to head for Peru and in Ecuador we must guarantee their rights. It's a humanitarian crisis,"" he told a local radio station.

858,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 06:27PM ET</span>","Islamic State chief, in rare speech, urges followers to fight on","CAIRO (Reuters) - Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in his first purported speech in nearly a year, has called on followers to fight on despite recent defeats, according to an audio recording posted on the group's media outlet.
In the 55-minute statement, Baghdadi congratulated what he described as the ""striking lions"" behind recent attacks in Canada and Europe and called on followers to use bombs, knives or cars to carry out attacks.
Baghdadi also offered greetings to Muslims for Eid al-Adha, a feast which is celebrated this week, suggesting the message was recorded recently.
""For the Mujahideen (holy warriors) the scale of victory or defeat is not dependant on a city or town being stolen or subject to that who has aerial superiority, intercontinental missiles or smart bombs,"" Baghdadi said in a recording in Arabic posted by his al-Furqan media group.
""Oh Caliphate soldiers.... trust in God's promise and His victory... for with hardship comes relief and a way out,"" he added, addressing followers in various cities in Syria.
Reuters was unable to verify whether the voice on the recording was Baghdadi's.
Islamic State, which until last year controlled large areas in Syria and Iraq, has since been driven into the desert by successive defeats in offensives by international allies in both countries.
Baghdadi, who declared himself ruler of all Muslims in 2014 after capturing Iraq’s main northern city Mosul, is now believed to be hiding in the Iraqi-Syrian border region after losing all the cities and towns of his self-proclaimed caliphate.
Islamic State has claimed responsibility for attacks around the world, including a July 22 shooting in Toronto that left two people dead and 13 wounded. Canadian police said that they had no evidence so far to support the claim.
Baghdadi also called on Iraqi followers to keep up attacks against Shi'ite Muslims and what he described as apostates -- a reference to Sunni Muslims fighting against his group.
He called on followers to remain loyal to the leaders of his movement and urged the citizens of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Jordan to overthrow their rulers.
The secretive Islamic State leader has frequently been reported killed or wounded since leading his fighters on a sweep through northern Iraq. His whereabouts are not known but Wednesday's message suggests he is still alive.
One of his sons was reported to have been killed in the city of Homs in Syria, the group's news channel reported earlier this year.
Baghdadi also warned that Idlib province in Syria was about to fall as Russia and Syrian government forces were preparing to invade it. Idlib province is in the last swathe of territory still held by rebels opposed to the rule of President Bashar al-Assad.

In June, the United Nations' regional humanitarian coordinator warned that Islamic State and other militant groups were mingled with the population in Idlib, making it a “highly explosive” situation.

859,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 06:20PM ET</span>",Images indicate North Korea halted dismantling of launch site: think tank,"By David Brunnstrom and Matt Spetalnick
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Satellite photos from last week indicate North Korea halted work to dismantle a missile engine test site in the first part of August, in spite of a promise to U.S. President Donald Trump at a June summit, a Washington think tank reported on Wednesday.
The 38 North project said commercial satellite imagery of the Sohae Satellite Launching Station taken on Aug. 16 indicated ""no significant dismantlement activity"" at either the site's engine test stand or launch pad since Aug. 3.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last month that reports that North Korea had started dismantling facilities at Sohae were consistent with a commitment North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made at a summit with Trump in Singapore on June 12.
The 38 North report said significant progress in tearing down the test stand had been made from July to early August, but added: ""The components previously removed remain stacked on the ground.""
It said work to take down a rail-mounted transfer/processing building at the launch pad also appeared to have stalled and it was not clear if the work that had taken place on that was associated with dismantling or modification of the structure.
The 38 North report comes at a time of widespread doubts about North Korea's willingness to go along with U.S. demands for it to give up its nuclear weapons.
There was no immediate comment from the White House.
The U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said in a report on Monday that it had not found any indication that North Korea had stopped its nuclear activities.
In Singapore, Kim agreed in broad terms to work toward denuclearization of the Korean peninsula but he has given no sign he is willing to give up his arsenal unilaterally.
In an interview with Reuters on Monday, Trump defended his efforts to convince Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons, saying he believed North Korea had taken specific steps toward denuclearization. He said he would ""most likely"" meet again with Kim.
However, several members of the U.S. negotiating team said they had seen no progress toward denuclearization and no sign that North Korea was prepared to negotiate seriously until the United States promised relief from sanctions in return.
North Korea state media last week blamed lack of progress in talks since the summit on members of the U.S. negotiating team and said breaking the deadlock would demand ""a bold decision on the part of President Trump."" A commentary in its Rodong Sinmun newspaper on Saturday said those opposed to dialogue were seeking to derail talks by making baseless references to ""secret nuclear facilities"" in North Korea.
U.S. officials have been trying to persuade North Korea to declare the extent of its weapons programs, something Pyongyang had always refused to do in past failed rounds of talks.
Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, said this month that Pyongyang had not taken the necessary steps to denuclearize while U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said Washington was ""not willing to wait for too long.""

Bolton said Trump, in a letter to Kim, had proposed sending Pompeo back to North Korea for what would be his fourth visit this year and that the president was ready to meet with Kim again at any time.

860,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 06:10PM ET</span>",Iowa student's murder thrust into U.S. debate over immigration,"By Joseph Ax
(Reuters) - The arrest of a man who U.S. authorities have said is an illegal immigrant on charges of murdering an Iowa college student has thrust the case into the debate on immigration policy, with President Donald Trump blaming Mollie Tibbetts' death on weak laws.
Christhian Rivera, 24, was arrested and charged on Monday with the murder of 20-year-old Tibbetts, who disappeared in July while out jogging. A woman's body has been found but has not yet been positively identified, authorities have said.
Law enforcement officials told reporters on Monday that Rivera was Mexican and in the country illegally. However, his defense lawyer said in a court filing on Wednesday that Rivera had legal status.
Trump, who has taken a tough stance on immigration and referred to some Mexican migrants as criminals and rapists in his 2016 election campaign, made a reference to the Tibbetts case at a rally in West Virginia on Tuesday.
""Should never have happened,"" said Trump. ""The immigration laws are such a disgrace.""
The political fallout from the killing could reverberate across Iowa, a swing state that has a hotly contested gubernatorial race and where Democrats see a chance at taking two of the 23 seats they need to win back from Republicans in November's midterms to gain a majority in the House of Representatives.
Iowa Republican Governor Kim Reynolds echoed Trump's approach, blaming Tibbetts' death on the nation's immigration laws.
""We are angry that a broken immigration system allowed a predator like this to live in our community, and we will do all we can bring justice to Mollie's killer,"" she said in a Tuesday statement.
But Republican members of Congress and congressional candidates in closely competitive Iowa districts were more guarded, perhaps wary of voter backlash if they politicized the case.
Republican lawmakers Rod Blum and David Young each issued statements expressing sympathy for the Tibbetts' family but avoided any mention of illegal immigration.
Christopher Peters, a Republican mounting a long-shot challenge to Iowa Democratic Congressman Dave Loebsack, said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that politicizing Tibbetts' murder ""cheapens the death of this young woman.""
""Yes, our immigration system is broken, and Congress has failed to fix it,"" Peters wrote. ""There is much we can and must do. For now, though, we should mourn the loss of Mollie.""
Tibbetts' father, who made many public pleas for information about his daughter's whereabouts, could not be reached for comment on Wednesday. A man who picked up the phone at the home of Tibbetts' mother in Iowa declined to comment.
During his 2016 campaign, Trump spoke almost daily about the 2015 death of Kate Steinle, who was struck by a bullet that ricocheted off the ground after being accidentally fired by an illegal immigrant. A jury last year cleared the immigrant of murder and manslaughter charges, and Trump railed against the decision.
Iowa voters might recoil at Tibbetts' death being politicized so quickly, said Timothy Hagle, a political science professor at the University of Iowa.
""Kate Steinle was used nationally by Republicans as an example of a system that needs fixing,"" Hagle said. ""That might happen again, but I'm not sure it will be handled the same way in Iowa.""
Several residents of Brooklyn, Iowa, where Tibbetts lived, expressed sadness at how quickly her death had become a political talking point.

""I wish Trump had not made this political,"" said Janice, a 60-year-old waitress at the Classic Deli, who declined to give her last name. ""The family just wants to heal. I have a farm with Mexican immigrants, and I never felt afraid.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations warned on Thursday of what it described as a lost generation of Muslim Rohingya children, with half a million in refugee camps in Bangladesh facing dangers including disease and floods and those still in Myanmar lacking access to proper education.
One year since 700,000 Rohingyas fled a violent crackdown by Myanmar security forces in Rakhine state, the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) gave a bleak assessment of the outlook for children on either side of the border.
""We are talking about risking the loss or the potential loss of a generation of Rohingya children,"" UNICEF spokesman Simon Ingram told news conference in Geneva after spending six weeks in the camps in Cox's Bazar.
""It isn't just the half a million children or so on the Bangladeshi side of border but it's also those who are still left behind in Rakhine state, whose access to education is patchy at best and highly limited,"" he said.
The U.N. estimates that 530,000 to 600,000 stateless Rohingyas remain in Rakhine state, including some 360,000 children, he said. The U.N. has limited access there.
The Rohingya, who regard themselves as native to Rakhine state, are widely considered as interlopers by Myanmar's Buddhist majority and are denied citizenship.
Myanmar's military launched the crackdown in northern Rakhine a year ago in response to militant attacks. The civilian administration of government leader Aung San Suu Kyi defended what it described as a legitimate counter-insurgency operation.
The administration has said it is ready to accept back refugees. Suu Kyi said on Tuesday spaces have been mapped out for the resettlement of people who fled.
Ingram said the prospects for their return to Myanmar anytime soon were bleak, despite a voluntary repatriation agreement signed by the Yangon government and U.N. agencies in June. He said conditions in Rakhine remained unsafe.

UNICEF said it was expanding education programs in the camps in Bangladesh, currently for children up to the age of 14, to try to meet the needs of older children.

ANKARA (Reuters) - The spokesman for President Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday slammed what he said was the United States' disregard for Turkey's legal process, adding Washington had made arbitrary comments and demands in the case of a detained pastor.
In a statement to Reuters, Ibrahim Kalin called on the United States to respect Turkey's judicial independence, one of Ankara's most pointed responses yet to criticism over its detention of evangelical Christian pastor Andrew Brunson.
""There is rule of law in Turkey and the Andrew Brunson case is a legal issue. There is an ongoing legal process related to this individual,"" Kalin said.
""It goes without saying that we find unacceptable the disregard of the legal process by the United States, which has been making certain demands."" 
His comments came after President Donald Trump's national security adviser John Bolton earlier told Reuters that Turkey made a ""big mistake"" in not releasing Brunson. 
Brunson, who has lived in Turkey for two decades, has been detained for 21 months on terrorism charges, which he denies, and is now under house arrest.
Trump, who counts evangelical Christians among his core supporters, has become a vocal champion of the pastor's case, making him an unwitting flashpoint in the tension between two NATO allies.
""Every day that goes by that mistake continues, this crisis could be over instantly if they did the right thing as a NATO ally, part of the West, and release (him) ... without condition,"" Bolton said.
Kalin, dismissed those statement as ""arbitrary"" comments and demands. He also hit back against the United States over an investigation into state-owned lender Halkbank for potential Iran-sanctions busting.
Turkey wants the U.S. Treasury to halt the investigation. Halkbank has said all of its transactions were legal. A U.S. court this year sentenced one of its executives to 32 months in prison for involvement in a scheme to avoid Iran sanctions.
""It is unacceptable that certain baseless and false allegations are made against Halkbank to weaken this public bank,"" Kalin said.

""It seems that the purpose of those steps is to discredit respectable institutions and persons, and to punish them unjustly rather than discover the truth.""

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's spokesman said on Wednesday remarks by the U.S. National Security Adviser regarding Turkey's economic situation were proof that the U.S. administration is targeting a NATO ally as part of an economic war.
In a written statement responding to an interview which John Bolton gave to Reuters, Erdogan spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said the U.S. administration's most recent policies were at odds with the fundamental principles and values of the NATO alliance.
Turkey and the United States are embroiled in a deep dispute focused on a U.S. pastor being tried on terrorism charges in Turkey. The row has fueled a slide in the lira , which has lost more than a third of its value against the dollar this year.
Bolton had said during a visit to Israel he was skeptical about the pledge of $15 billion of investment support for Turkey by Qatar's Emir, which was ""utterly insufficient to have an impact on Turkey's economy"".
""His statement is proof that the Trump administration is targeting a NATO ally as part of an economic war,"" Kalin said.
""The Trump administration has ... established that it intends to use trade, tariffs and sanctions to start a global trade war,"" he said, pointing to similar disputes with Mexico, Canada, Europe and China.
""Turkey has no intention of starting an economic war with any party. It cannot, however, be expected to keep silent in the face of attacks against its economy and judiciary,"" he said. 
Kalin said Turkey would work with the rest of the world against restrictive and punitive measures.

""The U.S. administration's most recent policies are at odds with the fundamental principles and values of the NATO alliance,"" he added.

(Reuters) - A 24-year-old farm worker charged with the murder of an Iowa college student who disappeared while jogging is in the country legally, contrary to the claims of prosecutors that he was an illegal immigrant, his attorneys said on Wednesday.
Attorneys for Cristhian Rivera made the assertion in a motion seeking a gag order for his upcoming court proceedings and trial over the murder of 20-year-old Mollie Tibbetts, a case that has drawn extensive international news coverage.
""The government is promoting the idea that Cristhian is not present in this jurisdiction legally,"" defense attorney Allan Richards said in the court documents, adding that such comments would prejudice his right to a fair trial.
""Former leader of Iowa's educational system (The Iowa Board of Regents) Craig Lang has verified that Cristhian is in this jurisdiction legally,"" Richards wrote. ""Cristhian has complied with his documented status since arriving in the USA as a minor.""
Representatives for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the claim by Rivera's attorneys.
Rick Rahn, special agent in charge of the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation, told reporters following Rivera's arrest on Monday that he was in the country illegally and that investigators believed he was from Mexico.
On Tuesday evening, U.S. President Donald Trump made an apparent reference to the case during a campaign speech in West Virginia.
""You heard about today with the illegal alien coming in, very sadly, from Mexico and you saw what happened to that incredible, beautiful young woman,"" said Trump, without naming Rivera or Tibbetts specifically.
Rivera was taken into custody on Monday after police said he was identified in security video taken from a camera outside a house in Brooklyn, Iowa, where Tibbetts was last seen alive.
Rivera's black Chevrolet Malibu appeared in the video, helping lead investigators to him, Rahn said. Tibbetts is also seen jogging in one of the clips from the surveillance camera, Rahn said.
The July disappearance of Tibbetts, who attended the University of Iowa, touched off a massive search and international headlines.
A woman's body was found in a cornfield about 10 miles from Brooklyn, where Tibbetts was staying at her boyfriend's residence, authorities said on Tuesday.
No positive identification has yet been made on the remains, as of Wednesday afternoon, said Mitch Mortvedt, spokesman for the Iowa Department of Public Safety, by telephone.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Three Canadian universities said on Wednesday that Saudi trainee doctors enrolled in their programs had been granted an extra three weeks in the country, a brief reprieve as a spat between the two countries forces nearly 1,000 people to leave their training early.
A call came this week from the Saudi Arabian Cultural Bureau, the organization that places hundreds of Saudi postgraduate medical students in Canadian hospitals, said Salvatore Spadafora, vice-dean of post-MD education at the University of Toronto. 
It was not immediately clear why the extension was granted. Students across Canada have scrambled to arrange their affairs and book flights out of the country.
The extension comes two weeks after Saudi Arabia, furious at Canada's call for the release of arrested activists, ordered all Saudi students home by the end of the month. 
Riyad also froze new trade with Canada, expelled the country's ambassador and blocked imports of Canadian grain. 
""We have a verbal commitment... that there is an extension of the return-home date to September 22"" from Aug. 31, Spadafora said, adding that the schools are awaiting written confirmation from the Saudi government that the trainees can stay.
Dalhousie University, in the eastern city of Halifax, and McMaster University, in the Toronto-area city of Hamilton, confirmed their Saudi students had received an extension.
Saudi Arabia is the largest source of foreign-trained medical residents and fellows in Canada, according to the Saudi Arabian Culture Bureau. It said 514 Saudis accounted for ""over 95 percent"" of the country's international residency spots in the coming academic year.
""We remain hopeful there can be a resolution in the end that allows our learners to stay,"" Spadafora said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is expected to tap Zalmay Khalilzad, an Afghan-born former U.S. ambassador to Kabul and Iraq, as his special envoy on Afghanistan, two U.S. officials said, the latest signal to the Taliban that the United States is serious about talks to end its longest war.
The decision to tap Khalilzad, a Republican foreign policy veteran, comes as U.S. military commanders acknowledge a stalemate in the fighting and follows a meeting last month between a U.S. diplomat and Taliban officials to explore possible negotiations. 
The administration has not officially confirmed those talks. 
The two U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they were unsure when the announcement would be made. The White House and the State Department declined to comment, and Khalilzad did not return messages left with his office.
The outgoing U.S. commander of U.S. and international troops insisted on Wednesday that despite a recent wave of violence, Trump's strategy of an open-ended deployment of U.S. military advisers, trainers and special operations forces and increased air support for Afghan forces is succeeding. 
""I believe the strategy is working. ... The reconciliation progress is significant and ultimately wars end with a political settlement,"" said U.S. Army General John Nicholson, commander of the NATO-led Resolute Support mission.
Trump, however, has expressed frustration at the lack of progress toward a U.S. withdrawal after 17 years of conflict. In a policy shift during a June ceasefire, Washington said it would “support, facilitate and participate” in any Kabul government-led peace talks with the Taliban.
The surge in Taliban attacks, including an assault last week on the provincial capital of Ghazni that took U.S.-backed Afghan forces four days to put down, has raised questions about their interest in negotiations.
Nicholson acknowledged the Afghan government had not significantly increased its control over territory. While he said the Taliban have not responded to an offer this week of a ceasefire from President Ashraf Ghani, two insurgent commanders told Reuters that the insurgents rejected the call.
LONG GOVERNMENT SERVICE
Khalilzad, 67, is well suited to the difficult task of persuading the insurgents to talk, according to a former senior U.S. official, who asked not to be further identified.
In addition to his experience advising or working for four U.S. administrations and his knowledge of Afghanistan’s main languages, culture and politics, he is from the ethnic Pashtun majority and is close to Ghani, the former official said.
Pompeo’s decision to tap Khalilzad shows the administration is “serious about getting a peace process going,” said the former official.
One possible drawback for Khalilzad, the former official said, is that he has been publicly critical of neighboring Pakistan, which Washington accuses of providing sanctuary and support to the Taliban but whose cooperation is crucial to any peace effort.
Pakistan denies supporting the Taliban.
In a possible wrinkle, the Taliban said on Wednesday it would send senior members to Russia for peace talks on Afghanistan, hours after the Afghan government declined the offer to attend. Washington has also said it would not go.
Khalilzad was born in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif and served in a variety of U.S. government posts.
As an aide to President George W. Bush, he helped plan the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan that followed the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks by al Qaeda, which had been based in that country. That invasion also ousted the Taliban, whose Islamist government ruled the country beginning in 1996.
Khalilzad served as U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan from 2003 to 2005, and he helped draft the country’s constitution. He went on to be ambassador to Iraq and then U.S. envoy to the United Nations. 
Nicholson, who after more than two years has become the longest-serving U.S. commander of international forces, is going to be replaced by Army Lieutenant General Scott Miller next month.

The Pentagon also nominated Marine Lieutenant General Kenneth McKenzie, director of the Joint Staff, to be the next commander of U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in much of the Middle East and South Asia, including Afghanistan.

""A sex assault case was presented yesterday to our office by the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department involving Kevin Spacey. It remains under review,"" Los Angeles District Attorney spokesman Greg Risling said in an emailed statement.
Risling declined to give any details on the latest case.
Representatives for the actor did not immediately return requests for comment on Wednesday.
The District Attorney's office said in April that it was reviewing a case involving Spacey dating from 1992, involving an adult male. Spacey last October publicly acknowledged for the first time that he was gay.
More than 30 men have said they were victims of unwanted sexual advances by Spacey, who became embroiled in controversy last year when actor Anthony Rapp accused him of trying to seduce him in 1986 when Rapp was 14. In October, Spacey apologized for any inappropriate conduct with Rapp but has not commented since.
The fallout resulted in Spacey, who won a best actor Oscar in 2000 for ""American Beauty,"" being dropped from the final season of the Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) series ""House of Cards"" and erased from the 2017 movie ""All the Money in the World.""
Netflix in January reported a $39 million write-off on Spacey-related projects.
London's Old Vic theater, where Spacey served as artistic director for 12 years, said last year that it received 20 accusations of inappropriate conduct by Spacey between 1995 and 2013.
Spacey is one of dozens of men in the entertainment industry and politics who have been accused of sexual misconduct in the past 10 months, partly as a result of the #MeToo social media movement.

HAVANA (Reuters) - The United States' ability to monitor Cuba, defend human rights, conduct consular activities and comply with bilateral agreements is being undermined by a drastic reduction in staff at the embassy in Havana, according to a congressional report.
The administration of President Donald Trump, which has partly rolled back Washington's detente with Cuba, has sharply reduced U.S. staff in Havana and expelled 15 Cuban diplomats.
The document from the non-partisan Congressional Research Service (CRS) states that the decision to reduce staffing from more than 50 diplomats to a maximum of 18 - due to a mysterious illness that has affected 26 officials and family members - overwhelmed those remaining at their posts.
""Because of the reduction in U.S. staff, U.S. officials maintain that those officers at post often wear two or three hats in terms of responsibilities,"" read the report, issued at the request of New York Representative Eliot Engel, the ranking Democratic member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
While diplomatic and humanitarian visas are being granted, Americans in Cuba can only expect emergency services, the report said.
Outreach to civil society and human rights activists has also been reduced at a time when Cuba is transitioning to a new generation of political leaders, internet access is spreading and a revamped constitution is headed for a referendum vote.
The U.S. State Department this month announced this month that the few remaining staff would be assigned for just a year instead of two, ""making it difficult for the continuity of operations and familiarity with working in Cuba,"" the report stated.
The U.S. Embassy in Havana was not immediately available for comment on the report.
Not a single refugee visa has been issued so far this year as the processing office is closed, the report noted. Often granted to government opponents claiming persecution, a total of 177 such visas were issued in 2017.
A 1994 agreement to accept 20,000 Cuban migrants annually will also not be met in 2018, according to the report, in part because applicants must travel to Guyana for interviews.
The Trump administration insists the current policy will remain in place until the mystery of the health problems among diplomatic staff, which it often refers to as ""attacks,"" is solved.
Staff have suffered symptoms such as hearing loss, dizziness, fatigue and memory issues, according to the State Department.
Cuba, the United States and Canada - whose diplomats were also affected - have been investigating the incidents for 18 months. China has now joined the inquiry after a few U.S. diplomats there came down with similar symptoms this year.
Paul Hare, a former British ambassador to Cuba who lectures at Boston University's Pardee School of Global Studies, said U.S. staffing was enough to monitor Cuba, but not carry out more labor-intensive activities.

""Diplomacy is continuous and all problems are eventually resolved. Sooner or later this will be,"" he said. ""But perhaps it suits the Trump administration not to engage with Cuba and to warn U.S. visitors who go there that the normal consular protection services of an embassy may be hard to find,"" he said.

KABUL (Reuters) - The Taliban said on Wednesday it would send senior members to Russia for peace talks on Afghanistan, hours after the Afghan government declined the offer to attend.
Russia has invited several countries, including the United States, to the Moscow talks in September but Washington and Afghanistan have said they will not go.
""Our leaders have accepted Russia's invitation to participate in Russia-led peace talks,"" said Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid.
At least four senior Taliban members will attend, said a Taliban commander, adding that the delegation would be led by Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanekzai, the head of the Islamist group's political office in the Qatari capital Doha.
Hours earlier, the Afghan government said it would not go, a decision that could scupper Moscow's plans for talks on Sept. 4 to discuss the future of the country.
""We have decided against attending the Moscow conference,"" said an official of the Afghan foreign ministry, adding that the government would ""hold direct talks"" with the Taliban without the direct involvement of foreign powers.
There appeared to have been a shift in Kabul's stance. Earlier on Wednesday, the office of Afghan national security adviser, Hanif Atmar, said he had asked Russia's ambassador Alexander Mantytski ""to put pressure on Taliban insurgents to begin negotiations with the Afghan government"". 
A senior Kabul-based foreign diplomat whose country is among those invited to the Moscow talks said Russia would now have to ""rethink the plans to hold their talks with the Taliban"".
""It's no point holding talks about Afghanistan if the leaders of the country are not attending,"" the diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The Russian Embassy in Kabul was not immediately available for comment.
RUSSIAN CONTACTS
According to a senior diplomat in Kabul, Moscow in recent months has stepped up direct contacts with the Taliban.
Russia rejected an accusation by NATO’s top commander in Afghanistan this year that it had been supplying weapons to the militant group.
Nearly 40 years have passed since Moscow sent its troops into Afghanistan for a bloody decade-long occupation. Factional conflict has continued ever since, and was given a new international dimension with the U.S.-led invasion of 2001.
Hundreds of people have been killed in Taliban attacks in recent weeks. The group said this week it would press on with its war despite the Kabul government's offer of a ceasefire.
Reports by international aid organizations suggest the group controls or contests around 40 percent of the country's districts.
Back-channel diplomacy between the Taliban and a range of countries — including the United States, Turkey and Saudi Arabia — has taken place over the years in the hope of bringing peace to the country.

872,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 03:29PM ET</span>","EU Commission, not ECB, presidency is priority for Merkel: Handelsblatt","By Paul Carrel
BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel is focusing on securing the European Commission presidency for a German candidate, rather than backing Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann to succeed Mario Draghi at the helm of the European Central Bank (ECB), Handelsblatt reported.
Such a move could prove significant because it would appear to reduce the prospect of Weidmann, the ECB's most hawkish policymaker, taking over leadership of the ECB just as it is likely to start exiting its ultra accommodative policy stance.
At the same time, securing the Commission presidency would be a shift given Germany, Europe's largest economy, has not held one of the top jobs since Walter Hallstein was president of the Commission of the European Economic Community, forerunner to the European Commission, from 1958 to 1967.
""The EU Commission rather than the ECB is the top priority for Merkel,"" business daily Handelsblatt quoted a high-ranking government official as saying.
The Bundesbank and a German government spokesman declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. However, sources close to Merkel recently said it was too soon to determine Germany's priorities for the European posts.
A clutch of top EU jobs are due to change hands by the end of next year: the presidents of the ECB, the European Commission and European Council all need to be replaced by the end of 2019.
But it may not become clear until mid-2019 who will be in the running as elections to the European Parliament next May will likely influence the field for the Commission role.
The two largest groups in the European Parliament usually decide between them who gets the Commission top job. But they risk not winning a majority between them this time, meaning at least another group will have to be involved in any such deal.
POSSIBLE CANDIDATES
Handelsblatt cited German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, Manfred Weber, the center-right leader in the European Parliament, and Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen as possible candidates for the EU Commission job.
Weidmann recently told Merkel he would be ready to be its candidate if the German government proposed him for the ECB top job, Handelsblatt said.
However, the government believed it would be more promising to back a candidate for the EU Commission post than to try to secure the ECB role for Weidmann, whose hardline stance has made him unpopular in much of southern Europe.
Last month, a top official from Italy's ruling League party voiced opposition to Weidmann becoming the next governor of the ECB, saying such an appointment could lead Europe to disintegrate.
Weidmann, 50, said in a radio interview last month that the next ECB chief must be someone who can tighten the money taps after years of crisis-fighting and stimulus.
Draghi, an Italian, is due to stand down when his eight-year term expires in October 2019. He faced competition for the post from German Axel Weber, before he quit central banking and took up the position of UBS chairman.
Draghi's time at the helm of the ECB coincided with the euro zone crisis, which he fought with an unprecedented package of monetary stimulus, much of it resisted by Weidmann. Draghi's successor will likely preside over an exit from the stimulus. 
Last month, the Italian backed investor expectations for an interest rate hike in October 2019, saying the risks from an unpredictable global trade conflict did not warrant any deviation from its plan.

At least five civilians and two soldiers died in the coordinated raids across violent neighborhoods in the north of the city on Monday, the army said at the time. 
However, on Wednesday, authorities said a third soldier, who had been wounded in the raids, died of injuries that had initially been considered treatable. 
The soldiers are the first troops to die in a six-month-old federal intervention in Rio, which has been criticized for military tactics, a lack of transparency and unclear goals.
In February, President Michel Temer announced emergency measures authorizing the army to take command of police forces in Rio de Janeiro state, where drug gangs and militias have triggered a sharp rise in violence.
Since the operation began, both murders and the number of people killed in police confrontations have risen, casting doubts on the strategy, according to official data.

Nearly 64,000 people were murdered in Brazil in 2017, a record high, and the rise in violence has become a key issue ahead of presidential elections in October. Candidates across the political spectrum are playing up their crime-fighting credentials to appeal to an electorate fed up with a weak economy and endemic graft.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German police on Wednesday detained a Russian man suspected of planning a bomb attack in Germany after turning to radical Islam, prosecutors said.
Police said the 31-year-old suspect, named as Magomed-Ali C. under German privacy rules, had acted together with a French national, Clement B., who was detained in Marseille, France, in April last year.
Magomed-Ali C., arrested in a raid on his apartment in Berlin, had stored large quantities of the explosive triacetone triperoxide or TATP in October 2016, a statement by the General Prosecutor's Office said. 
An unstable homemade explosive, TATP has been used by militants in several attacks in western Europe, including in Manchester, Britain, in May last year, Brussels in 2016 and Paris in 2015.
The suspect had planned to detonate the device at an unspecified location in Germany to kill and injure a maximum number of people, the statement said.
Clement B., who public prosecutors said had been in contact with a Tunisian man who killed 12 people in an attack in Berlin in December 2016, is accused of planning an attack using explosives with another French national, also now under arrest.
The two Frenchmen had met while sharing a cell in prison and were known to police as having turned to radical Islam, French prosecutors said last year. 
German police took measures in October 2016 to stop efforts by Clement B. and Magomed-Ali C. to plan an attack, German prosecutors said. The prosecutor's statement did not say why Magomed-Ali C. was not arrested at the time.
Fearing police detection, the two suspects decided to part ways and Clement B. left Germany for France at the end of October 2016.
Magomed-Ali C. will appear before a judge on Thursday when prosecutors said they will request he be kept in custody.
Frauke Koehler, senior public prosecutor and spokeswoman for the federal prosecutors office, told reporters Magomed-Ali C. had visited a mosque in Berlin that was also attended by Anis Amri, a Tunisian with Islamist militant ties who killed 12 people in the attack in Berlin in 2016, when he hijacked a truck and drove it into a crowded marketplace.
""So it's obviously possible that the paths of Magomed-Ali C. and Anis Amri crossed there,"" Koehler said, adding that Amri had been in contact with Clement B., who she said was also said to have visited the mosque.

""We have no indications that Magomed-Ali C. or Clement B. were involved in the Berlin Christmas market attack,"" she added.

ROME (Reuters) - Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Wednesday appealed to Italy's European Union partners to take in some of the migrants held on a coastguard ship in a Sicilian port and not allowed to disembark.
""What are they waiting for to intervene so that we can redistribute the migrants?"" Conte said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, from the far-right League party, has been resisting pressure to let the 177 migrants off the ship and the issue is straining relations with the League's coalition partner, the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement.
The coastguard ship Diciotti has been docked in the port of Catania for two days. Salvini has said he will not let the migrants aboard come ashore until other European countries agree to take them in. They were rescued from an overcrowded boat a week ago.
Backing up Salvini, Conte said Italy was ""waiting for a strong and clear answer from the European institutions and an adequate response from the other European countries"".
After Conte's comments, Salvini said on Facebook the 29 minors aboard the ship could disembark, but not the others. He accused other European countries of a ""cowardly silence"" over what to do with the migrants and said Brussels was ""sleeping"".
""If Europe doesn't play its part, as far as I'm concerned the boats can go back to where they came from,"" he said. 
In response to criticism earlier on Wednesday, Salvini posted a picture of some 20 protesters holding banners, including one reading, ""Let's stay human"", at the Catania port. 
""The 'very numerous' protesters who still want immigrants have arrived in Catania ... Should I send them a kiss?"" he wrote on Twitter, followed by an emoticon blowing a kiss.
Salvini also replied to a coastguard official who had told Corriere della Sera newspaper the situation was ""embarrassing"". Salvini said on Twitter that after over 650,000 arrivals from sea since 2014, ""I'm the embarrassing one?""
Salvini has repeatedly said Italy ""will no longer be Europe's refugee camp"", calling on European partners to share the burden. But his hardline position appeared to be irritating his 5-Star ally on Wednesday. 
Roberto Fico, the 5-Star speaker of the lower house, said on Twitter the migrants ""must be able to disembark. They cannot be held on board any longer"".
Salvini snapped back: ""you do your job as speaker of the Chamber and I'll do my job as minister.""
Last month President Sergio Mattarella made a rare intervention in Italian politics to end a simmering dispute between the two governing parties over whether to let the Diciotti disembark 67 migrants in western Sicily.
ITALY AGAINST MALTA
With the help of the European Commission, Malta and Italy have taken in ships carrying migrants after European partners offered to accept a share of the new arrivals themselves. 
""We call on everyone to contribute to a swift resolution so that the people onboard the (Diciotti) vessel may safely disembark,"" a European Commission spokeswoman said on Wednesday.
However, Conte said countries that had previously offered to take in migrants allowed to dock in Italy in July had not kept their word. France had taken some, but Germany, Portugal, Spain, Ireland and Malta had not, he said.
For its part, the Maltese government said in a statement on Wednesday: ""The Italian authorities have not provided any tangible procedure for Malta to follow.""
It added that Italy had failed to meet its quota from a humanitarian vessel that docked in Malta in June ""despite the efforts of the Maltese authorities to complete this process with the Italian authorities"". 
Migrant flows across the Mediterranean from Libya to Italy - one of the main routes to Europe - have tapered off as Libyan factions have cracked down on people-smugglers, and as the EU has bolstered its support for the Libyan coastguard.
But people are still dying at sea and summer is peak season for migrants attempting the crossing, often in overcrowded, unseaworthy boats. 

On Wednesday, the Maltese military picked up 100 migrants and two corpses from a boat that was in imminent danger of sinking, a statement said.

The two men are due to meet in Geneva for talks on Thursday in the first high-level meeting since the Russian and U.S. presidents held talks in Helsinki in July. 
Patrushev plans to bring Bolton a set of proposals on cooperation between Moscow and Washington and is optimistic about the reaction from the American side, he was quoted as saying by the TASS news agency in Geneva on Wednesday evening.
Themes like ""strategic stability, regional security,"" the situations in Syria and Ukraine as well as bilateral relations between Russia and the United States are expected to be discussed during the meeting, Patrushev added.
U.S. President Donald Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin last month, an event Moscow quickly chalked up as a triumph. However, a new salvo of U.S. sanctions was announced in the wake of the meeting after Trump came under fire at home for his handling of the summit. 
""The worsening of bilateral relations is continuing, we need to identify some kind of areas for cooperation and also to understand if there are any such areas and whether our counterpart (the United States) has a desire for this,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call.
Peskov said Putin had met his Security Council on Wednesday to discuss problems in U.S.-Russia relations ahead of the meeting between Bolton and Patrushev. 
During a trip to Israel on Wednesday, Bolton told Reuters that Russian forces were ""stuck"" in Syria and that Moscow was looking for other countries to fund post-war reconstruction there.
Russia launched an intervention in Syria in 2015, turning the tide of the war in favor of its ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. 
Peskov said Moscow disagreed with Bolton's statement, saying Moscow was helping to facilitate the return of refugees to Syria and to start the reconstruction process. 

""The statement that Russia is stuck is not correct, even more so coming from our colleagues in Washington. We shouldn't forget that American soldiers are also on Syrian territory,"" said Peskov.

Milorad Dodik said the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) was implementing its aid program through non-government organizations to conceal what he said was its real agenda of countering Russian influence in the region.
""Aiming to directly interfere in internal affairs of the Republika Srpska and Bosnia, USAID ... tries to avoid all institutions and to grant funds under cover of the alleged fight against crime and corruption,"" Dodik said.
Dodik, a critic of the West who favors closer ties with Russia, accused the central Bosnian government of conspiring with USAID in the matter and said that NGOs in the Serb Republic which receive USAID funding would be investigated.
Bosnia is divided into a Serb Republic and an entity for its Muslim Bosniak and Croat populations, which are linked via a weak central government.
The U.S. Embassy dismissed Dodik's accusations.
""Once again, the assistance of the people of the United States is being used to support wild conspiracy theories in the interest of election campaigning in Bosnia,"" it said in a statement.
The embassy said it was still negotiating with the Bosnian central government programs worth a total $8 million to help combat graft, and it accused Dodik of trying to mislead the public and intimidate USAID partners.
Bosnia's Prime Minister Denis Zvizdic also dismissed Dodik's allegations, saying the programs accepted by the Council of Ministers were only at an initial stage and could not influence the election process.
Dodik, who has been blacklisted by the United States for pushing for an illegal referendum on an illegal holiday, has often accused Western governments of being biased against Serbs.
Political analysts said Dodik's rhetoric showed he had begun early campaigning for Bosnia's parliamentary and presidential elections on Oct. 7. He plans to run for the Serbs' seat in Bosnia's tripartite inter-ethnic presidency.

Last month, Dodik also accused Britain of sending intelligence specialists to Bosnia to meddle in the election campaign. Britain said he was ""inventing fake threats"" as part of his election campaigning.

The U.S. Central Pacific Hurricane Center downgraded Hurricane Lane to a Category 4, the second-strongest on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale of wind intensity.
Bearing 155-mile per hour (250 km/h) winds, it threatened to dump as much as 20 inches (50 cm) of rain over parts of the islands, triggering major flash flooding and landslides.
Hawaii is already coping with the three-month eruption of Kilauea volcano on the Big Island, which was expected to start feeling the force of Lane's driving rains by late Wednesday afternoon, the Hawaii-based center said.
It said further weakening of the cyclone was expected as it continued on a track that could see it take aim at other islands beginning early Thursday.
""The center of Lane will track dangerously close to the islands Thursday through Saturday,"" the advisory said. ""Regardless of the exact track of the center, life threatening impacts are likely in some areas as the hurricane makes its closest approach.""
The most powerful storm on record hitting Hawaii was Hurricane Iniki, a Category 4 that made landfall on Kauai island on Sept. 11, 1992, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It killed six people and damaged or destroyed more than 14,000 homes. 
On Tuesday, Hawaii residents scrambled to prepare for the storm's arrival. Cars waited in long lines outside gasoline stations in Honolulu and people could be seen pulling small boats from the water ahead of expected pounding surf.
Lane was about 315 miles (505 km) south of Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, at 5 a.m. Hawaii time, U.S. forecasters said. It was expected to begin a turn toward the northwest of the island later on Wednesday, followed by a turn to the north-northwest on Thursday.

A Hurricane warning was in effect for all Hawaii County and Maui county, including the islands of Maui, Lanai, Molokai and Kahoolawe. A hurricane watch was in effect for Oahu and Kauai.

Prior to his current role as archbishop of Washington, Wuerl was bishop of Pittsburgh from 1988 to 2006. The grand jury report did not accuse him of personally sexually abusing children.
The Pittsburgh diocese said in a statement that following the release of the report, Wuerl asked last week for his name to be removed from Cardinal Wuerl North Catholic High School, saying he did not want to be a distraction. The school has been renamed North Catholic High School.
A two-year investigation into abuse in Pennsylvania found evidence that at least 1,000 people, mostly children, had been sexually abused by some 300 clergymen during the past 70 years. The report said the numbers of actual victims and abusers could be much higher.
The report found that Wuerl notified the Vatican in 1989 of several priests who had been accused of sexually abusing children but that over subsequent years he granted requests by some to be reassigned to other parishes or to retire early, and in one case approved a loan to assist one such priest with personal debts.
On Saturday, Wuerl canceled a planned speech at this week's World Meeting of Families in Dublin, the second high-ranking U.S. Church official to do so.

Last week's report was the most wide-ranging U.S. investigation into sexual abuse by priests since the scandal burst into the public eye in Boston in 2002.

DAKAR (Reuters) - A tanker vessel with 19 crew members on board, most of them Georgians, has gone missing in pirate-plagued waters off Gabon in West Africa and no word has been heard from it for a week, the ship's managers and the crew agency said on Wednesday.
Communication was lost with the Panama-registered Pantelena at about 2 a.m. local time on Aug. 14, at which time it was about 17 miles from the port of Libreville, in Gabon, Athens-based Lotus Shipping said in a statement.
The head of the Georgian crew agency Ialkani, Anzhela Oganesyan, said two Russian nationals and 17 Georgians were aboard the tanker. She said she had no news so far about the vessel's fate.
The Georgian government also said 17 of its citizens were serving on the Pantelena.
The Russian RIA news agency reported the Russian Embassy in Gabon as saying two Russians were on the tanker and it was in contact with their relatives.
Lotus gave no further details on the cargo and crew, and did not say if it believed the Pantelena had been hijacked by pirates. The vessel is a dual purpose oil or chemicals tanker. 
""We at Lotus Shipping, acting on behalf of the vessel's owners...have set as our first and foremost priority to safeguard the safety of the crew and with their interest in mind we cannot provide any additional media comments at this point in time,"" it said.
The Pantelena was on route from Lome to Libreville and was last seen nearing the Gabon coast at 9 p.m. on Aug. 13, according to ship tracking data on Reuters, which lists the ship as a double-hulled oil tanker managed by Lotus.
While piracy has decreased worldwide, the Gulf of Guinea has become an increasing target for pirates who steal cargo and demand ransoms. Piracy-related issues were a decade ago focused off the East African coast, particularly Somalia’s unpoliced waters.
Ships in the Gulf of Guinea were the target of a series of piracy-related incidents last year, according to a report in January by the International Maritime Bureau (IMB), which highlighted the waters off West Africa as an area of growing concern.
Ten incidents of kidnapping involving 65 crew members took place in or around Nigerian waters, the IMB said. Globally 16 vessels reported being fired upon, seven of which were in the Gulf of Guinea.

883,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 11:52AM ET</span>","After summer's growth revisions, Macron has budget work cut out","PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron will make the tough political choices needed to meet his deficit commitments, his government spokesman said, as he looked to put a bodyguard scandal behind him at his first cabinet meeting after the summer break.
Macron and his ministers in all likelihood need to find savings in next year's budget, to be presented to parliament next month, if they are to prevent the deficit from ballooning once again.
The president faced his first crisis in the summer when video surfaced of bodyguard Alexandre Benalla beating a protester. Macron's own aloof response fanned public discontent. 
Now the 40-year-old leader returns to work facing difficult political choices as he embarks on a new wave of reforms to reform the pensions system, overhaul public healthcare and shake-up the highly unionized public sector - tasks complicated by forecasts that economic growth is slower than expected.
""A budget is not only figures, but a strategy, and strong political choices,"" Griveaux said, without giving details on the budget negotiations. ""There will be (spending) increases and then we will require efforts from other sectors.""
The French economy eked out less growth than expected in the second quarter as strikes and higher taxes hit consumer spending, official data showed in July.
Macron has linked fiscal discipline to restoring France's credibility in Europe, and while the budget deficit -- forecast at 2.3 percent of GDP this year and next -- should not surpass the EU-mandated 3 percent limit, it is still expected to be one of the highest in the euro zone.
""The budget equation is becoming more complicated,"" Denis Ferrand, economist at COE-Rexecode told Reuters.
The Bank of France has revised 2018 growth down to 1.8 percent from 1.9 percent. Budget rapporteur Joel Giraud in July said that a revision down to 1.7 percent could see the public deficit slip by 0.2 percentage points.
Beyond raising eyebrows in Brussels and Berlin, it would also complicate Macron's efforts to make transfers toward social policies that might help him dispel the impression among leftist critics that he is a ""president of the rich"".
""It would be more difficult to find resources for social spending,"" Ferrand said.
Elysee officials acknowledge growth was lower than expected in the first half, and say the housing and subsidized jobs portfolios will see sharp cuts to help finance Macron's priorities in education, security and the environment.
Some 1 billion euros ($1.14 billion) is expected to be saved by changing rules for widely-enjoyed housing benefits, junior minister Julien Denormandie told BFM TV earlier on Wednesday.

Last year, a cut of five euros ($6) per month to the same allowance contributed to a sharp slump in the president's popularity, which opinion polls show plumbing lows.

The evacuees prayed, chanted and feasted together, marking the festival of sacrifice in open rice fields and under tents. Many communities received extra livestock as donations for the ritual of animal sacrifice, residents said.
""In the past, the meat was distributed by the mosque to people in need but now we are all equal, there’s no differences between the rich and the poor,"" said Rafiqah, whose family lost its home in one of the quakes.
""What is important is we are together in one evacuation camp,"" she added.
The jolts that rocked the island, which is popular with tourists for its beaches, flattened entire villages and many mosques in the north, forcing more than 350,000 people to flee their homes for fear of aftershocks. 
The earthquakes caused at least $340 million in damage, authorities said last week, and relief and reconstruction efforts were underway. [nL4N1V42P6]

Al-Taee and her husband, who has Alzheimer's, share their four-room apartment in eastern Mosul with the children, aged between two and 16, their daughter and two of their sons' widows. Rent, food, clothes and schooling depend on donations and charity handouts.
Al-Taee is waiting to hear if the government will provide pensions of 500,000 dinars ($420) a month for her sons, who worked in the military and police.
""I hope that the authorities will give pensions and housing for those orphans, because I am not going to live for 100 years,"" the 60-year-old told Reuters.
Al-Taee, who is in poor health with vocal cord paralysis, has provided death certificates for three sons but said the other two were buried in mass, unmarked graves and she has not been able to find their bodies.
That means they are classed as missing rather than dead so she has no death certificates for them and cannot apply for their pensions - a common problem for families in the north and west of the country where Islamic State controlled vast swaths of territory in 2014.
The militants were driven out by U.S.-backed Iraqi troops in December, but the government has said it will need up to $100 billion to rebuild the cities with Mosul's mosques, churches, markets and other landmarks left in ruin.
""When Daesh (Islamic state) militants seized our areas, they destroyed us. By God, the militants humiliated us. They killed our sons and nothing has remained,"" al-Taee said.

The two widows living in the cramped home had been working for local civil organizations but left after not being paid. They are now looking for work as servants. ($1 = 1,186.0000 Iraqi dinars)

Three of them brandished big knives and the youngest held up a phone with an Islamic State flag displayed on the screen as they pledged allegiance in Russian to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. 
The authenticity of the video and identities of the individuals could not be verified by Reuters, although the ages of the boys appeared consistent with statements by local officials who said the attackers were minors, one as young as 11.
In the attacks on Monday, which included a botched suicide bombing and a knife attack on a police station, four of the assailants were shot dead, while the fifth was hospitalized after he blew himself up but survived, Russian news agencies and officials said. 
In the video released by Islamic State's media arm Amaq, the boys described themselves as the ""Mujahideen of the Caucasus"" and threatened attacks on infidels.
The mainly Muslim internal republic of Chechnya has been dogged by attacks and a simmering insurgency since Moscow fought two wars with separatists there following the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union. 
""The oldest one who rammed the traffic police officers was almost 17, the youngest of the criminals was 11 years old, according to the information we have,"" Dzhambulat Umarov, Chechnya's communications minister was quoted as saying by TASS news agency. 
Parts of Russia's wider North Caucacus region are also volatile with unemployment and corruption pushing some young men to embrace radical Islam.
Chechnya is now ruled by Kremlin-backed leader Ramzan Kadyrov who has been criticized by human rights advocates for widespread abuses, but under whose helm attacks have become relatively rare.
That this attack was carried out by minors who grew up in Kadyrov's post-war Chechnya and had no personal experience of the wars themselves should be alarming for the Russian and Chechen authorities, said Ekaterina Sokirianskaia, director of the Conflict Analysis and Prevention Centre, which monitors conflicts in the former Soviet region. 
It is the first time such young children have been used in an attack in Chechnya, she said. 
""This is a new generation of jihadists that we're seeing now. They have not seen war. This is the post-war generation,"" she said.

BRASILIA/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The popularity of imprisoned former Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's has grown strongly despite his corruption conviction, an election poll on Wednesday showed, a result that rattled markets and raised the possibility that Lula's running mate could ultimately become the next occupant of the country's presidential palace.
Investors reacted unfavorably to the poll, sending Brazil's currency down 0.8 percent in late morning trading to 4.08 to the U.S. dollar, near an all-time low. 
Lula, the candidate for October's presidential election for the Workers Party (PT), which he founded, is almost certain to be barred from running by an electoral court. Brazilian law forbids the candidacy of anyone whose conviction has been upheld on appeal, as is the case with the charismatic former president.
In a Datafolha poll published by the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper and Globo TV, Lula easily led all contenders when his name was included, winning the support of 39 percent of those surveyed. Far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro was in second place with 19 percent, while environmentalist Marina Silva took 8 percent. 
If Lula's name is excluded, Bolsonaro leads with 22 percent and Marina Silva jumps to 16 percent. 
Other polls this week had similar results.
The PT's strategy is to keep Lula's candidacy alive for as long as possible, then work to transfer his support to his running mate, former Sao Paulo mayor Fernando Haddad, who polled just 4 percent in the Datafolha survey.
The poll found that 31 percent of respondents said they would definitely vote for Lula's handpicked successor if Lula is barred from running, while another 18 percent said that ""perhaps"" they would vote for a Lula-backed candidate. 
Lula's ability to transfer votes to Haddad is expected to grow as political ads begin to be aired at the end of this month. The PT is expected to pull out all stops to link Haddad to Lula in its ads. 
A PT return to power would yank Brazil's economic policies to the left, with investors fearing the return of a state-led economy and with no attempt to continue the economic reforms that deeply unpopular President Michel Temer has partially pushed through Congress. 
In the Datafolha poll, business favorite center-right candidate Geraldo Alckmin remained stuck in single digits with 9 percent, up from 7 percent in June. 
Under Brazil's strict election campaign advertising rules, Alckmin will have more TV ad time than any other candidate because of his large coalition, but it remains to be seen if marketers can transform him into a viable candidate. 
WITHOUT LULA
Bolsonaro, a former army captain who favors easing gun control laws to fight crime, has stirred controversy with comments denigrating women, gays, blacks and indigenous people.
Despite this, Bolsonaro has led the field from the outset when Lula is excluded, by tapping into voter anger over political corruption. 
Center-left candidate Ciro Gomes, a former governor of Ceará state in Brazil's poor Northeast, has held steady at 10 percent. Gomes has failed to draw the support of Lula voters he would need to become the new standard bearer of Brazil's left.

Datafolha surveyed 8,433 voters across Brazil Aug. 20-21. The poll has a margin of error of two percentage points.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday she agreed with her foreign minister that relations with the United States were changing but she stopped short of backing his call for a separate EU payments system to save a nuclear deal with Iran.
In a long column on how Europe should respond to U.S. policy under President Donald Trump, Heiko Maas, a member of Merkel's junior Social Democrat coalition partners, suggested that Europe needed its own system for cross-border payments to conduct trade with Iran in the face of U.S. sanctions. 
European powers are scrambling to ensure Iran continues to get the economic benefits needed to convince it to stay in the deal agreed in 2015 with six world powers but which the U.S. president abandoned in May. Trump has since imposed new sanctions on Iran which could trigger penalties on EU firms doing business with Tehran.
""On the question of independent payment systems, we have some problems in our dealings with Iran, no question, on the other hand we know that on questions of terrorist financing, for example, SWIFT is very important,"" Merkel told reporters, referring to the global SWIFT network that facilitates many of the world's cross-border transactions. 
She added that it was very important to keep good co-operation with the United States in the area of security.
Belgium-based SWIFT had no comment.
Maas wrote it was essential that Europe strengthen its autonomy by creating independent payment channels, a European Monetary Fund and an independent SWIFT system. 
A spokeswoman for the foreign ministry said the article by Maas in the Handelsblatt daily was intended to provoke debate on relations with Washington, including how European powers can keep the nuclear deal with Iran alive after the U.S. pullout.
Germany is discussing possibilities with partners, including Britain and France, said the spokeswoman. She added that keeping financial channels open was vital to save the deal, under which the Islamic Republic agreed to curb its nuclear activities in return for a lifting of international sanctions.
DOLLAR DOMINANCE
People familiar with SWIFT said that creating a second, European SWIFT without U.S. ties or a dedicated European messaging link to Tehran would not work given they would remain part of the same group that includes U.S. members.
The issue was not SWIFT but longstanding European frustration with the dollar's dominance in global finance and the cross-border political power it confers on the United States, they said.
""All this is about the aspiration to have an alternative to dollar payments. SWIFT is both a global standard and a messaging infrastructure, and fragmenting that would defeat the purpose of what SWIFT is about,"" said Nicolas Veron, a financial services specialist at Bruegel think tank in Brussels.
EU diplomats said U.S. President Donald Trump's America First stance on trade and Iran was fuelling a rethink about EU dependency on the U.S. financial system.
""He is forcing us to explore alternatives …or we can’t carry out our own policies,"" a diplomat said.
However, European powers appear to be struggling to find or agree on effective options. 
Merkel, leader of Germany's conservative bloc, said she had read the article by Maas and that its broad thrust, calling for a new approach to the United States, chimed with her thinking. 

""It was an important contribution as it expresses in other words what I have said, that the transatlantic relationship is changing, we need to take more responsibility, Europe has to take its fate into its own hands,"" she told a news conference alongside the visiting president of Angola.

Television images showed some of the migrants with bloodied arms and legs, apparently caused by the razor wire that tops the border fences, cheering as they walked toward a temporary reception center. Most of them were young men. 
""I love Spain!"" shouted one. Some were draped in European Union and Spanish flags.
More than 3,800 migrants have crossed the Moroccan border into the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla so far this year, according to the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR. The route accounted for 14 percent of the total 27,600 who arrived, mainly by sea, between January and July, a 130 percent increase on the previous year. 
Five migrants were injured in the jump, and seven Spanish policemen suffered burns caused by a corrosive substance thrown by the migrants, the spokesman said.
During a recent visit to Spain, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez agreed to increase dialogue with Morocco to handle migrant inflows to Spain, which is now the main destination for people seeking a better life in Europe. 
EU leaders have failed to agree a long-term plan on where to house migrants since brokering a convoluted deal in June that appeared designed to appease divergent views rather than provide concrete solutions to the crisis.

Eight days ago, five European Union countries agreed to take in 141 migrants on board the Mediterranean rescue ship Aquarius, a move that ended a four-day standoff in which Spain, Tunisia and Malta refused the ship entry.

892,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 09:13AM ET</span>",Rifts at the top rattle Zimbabwe after Mugabe,"By Joe Brock
HARARE (Reuters) - As Zimbabwe braced for opposition protests after this month's disputed election, a heated argument broke out in the offices of President Emmerson Mnangagwa over who was in charge of national security, two people with direct knowledge of the meeting said.
At one point, Vice President Constantino Chiwenga reminded Mnangagwa that it was he who had installed the president in power after last year's coup against Robert Mugabe.
Details obtained by Reuters about the post-election rift between Mnangagwa and Chiwenga paint the clearest picture yet of a power struggle that could define Zimbabwe's future.
As a result, Western governments and big business fear Zimbabwe may not fulfil its economic potential, putting at risk billions of dollars in aid and foreign investment.
Zimbabweans had hoped that the election on July 30 would turn a page following decades of turmoil under Mugabe.
That optimism evaporated in the days that followed a military crackdown on demonstrators, when the Zimbabwe Election Commission (ZEC) was alleged by the opposition to have rigged the vote, and police and soldiers were accused of abusing opposition supporters.
Mnangagwa, the 75-year-old Mugabe ally who replaced his old friend, was declared the winner by the ZEC on Aug. 2, but the leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Nelson Chamisa, 40, is challenging the result in the constitutional court this week.
Analysts say the court is unlikely to overturn the result. 
Presidential spokesman George Charamba said there were no divisions between Chiwenga and Mnangagwa, echoing the united front the two have maintained publicly.
""The overbearing reality of harmony within the Presidency will not change because of wishful scenario-building,"" Charamba said in an emailed response to questions. ""One gets a sense some interests feel threatened by the combination in the Presidency.""
TENSIONS MOUNT
After a more peaceful build-up to the election compared with the violence of the Mugabe years, nervousness grew when the ZEC delayed releasing the presidential result.
When it eventually became clear that the ZEC was about to announce Mnangagwa had won, Chamisa claimed victory on July 31 and accused ZEC chairwoman Priscilla Chigumba of collaborating with ZANU-PF, the ruling party, to steal the election. Chigumba has defended her independence. 
As tension mounted that day, Mnangagwa, Chiwenga, and defense forces chief Philip Sibanda held crisis talks in the presidency offices in Harare, according to the two sources, one from the military and another from ZANU-PF. Several other senior officials were present, they said.
Chiwenga, 61, said that since he held the defense portfolio he should manage security at opposition demonstrations expected the following day, the sources said.
Mnangagwa and Sibanda wanted any protests to be handled by the police.
""Chiwenga was unhappy. He said the election had been badly managed and stability needed to be restored. It got heated,"" said the military source.
""Chiwenga said no one should forget who got rid of Mugabe.""
Charamba, who speaks for the president and vice-president, declined to comment further. Chiwenga did not answer a call to his phone. An army spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A day after the meeting, as riot police tried to disperse protesters in Harare, military armored vehicles unexpectedly rolled onto the streets. Soldiers fired live rounds and beat opposition supporters. Six were killed.
Since then human rights groups have reported more than 150 incidents of alleged abuses by security forces against opposition supporters, including illegal detention, assault, looting and rape. Many in the MDC have fled.
Mnangagwa has denied reports of an opposition crackdown and said last week that human rights groups ""have an agenda"".
PARALLEL STATES
International election observers have called for greater transparency over the army crackdown on Aug. 1, which they say is threatening to undermine Mnangagwa's credibility.
Mnangagwa, who has opened an investigation into the violence, says the MDC is to blame for any deaths because it encouraged demonstrations. There has been no explanation why soldiers used live rounds against unarmed protesters.
The police have said they called for military assistance.
But two senior Western diplomats said Mnangagwa's team told them that Chiwenga was responsible for ordering the army onto the streets, without providing any evidence.
Chiwenga, who spent four decades as a soldier before going into government in December, has not commented about the military intervention publicly.
""If Mnangagwa ordered the deployment it is a worry. If he didn't know about it, in a way, it is more worrying. You have to ask: who is in control?"" one of the diplomats told Reuters.
""This internal struggle may paralyze any reform process and Zimbabwe will continue to lurch from crisis to crisis.""
Many analysts and diplomats in Harare believe Chiwenga's ultimate ambition in removing Mugabe was to take his seat but he handed power to Mnangagwa to give the military intervention the veil of legitimacy.
""Chiwenga should not be underestimated. He will dig in,"" said Alex Magaisa, a London-based political analyst.
""If Mnangagwa survives the court challenge, I still do not expect him to finish his term. I expect Chiwenga to take over before the next election."" 
The acrimony between the Mnangagwa and Chiwenga factions has intensified due to the failure to achieve the smooth election Mnangagwa promised, security sources say.
""They are operating parallel governments,"" Magaisa said. 
The split between Chiwenga and Mnangagwa is making it difficult for investors, who say they don't know who to talk to. Many deals have fallen apart. 
If Zimbabwe is to secure the International Monetary Fund help it needs to revive the economy, Mnangagwa and Chamisa must find a way to push through painful reforms. They have a history of overcoming adversity together.
""DEFINING MOMENT""
In 2003 Chiwenga, Mnangagwa and Mugabe were among 77 Zimbabweans sanctioned by the United States for allegedly undermining ""democratic processes"" and causing ""politically motivated violence"" in elections the previous year. Mugabe's administration denied committing human rights violations.
Despite a spending decades alongside Mugabe, both men are trying to show they are a break from the past.
Mnangagwa has made progress improving relations with Western states since taking power as he seeks to shed his image as Mugabe's right-hand man and allegations of involvement in a crackdown in the 1980s that killed 20,000 people. He denies wrongdoing.
However that charm offensive may already be unraveling after spokesman Charamba - a close Chiwenga ally - blamed ""hostility"" from Western states, primarily the United States, for putting off investors.
Chiwenga, who has close ties with Russia and China, is struggling to rebrand himself as a statesman rather than a soldier. He met officials from Britain and the European Union last week to discuss national security but made a poor impression, a source who was in the meeting said.
When diplomats raised concerns about human rights abuses and the violence on Aug. 1, Chiwenga dismissed it as ""fake news"" and told them not to interfere, the source said.
Fears are growing that a divided presidency will not achieve the drastic overhaul of government departments and the security services that Western states have demanded. 
""This is a defining moment for the credibility of this government. The time for rhetoric is over,"" said Piers Pigou, a southern Africa consultant at the Crisis Group think-tank.
The ructions have also dismayed Zimbabweans who took to the streets to embrace soldiers during the coup last year.
""We should have known these generals would end up being the real ones in control,"" said Tonde, a Harare street trader.

""They swapped camouflage for suits and ties but they are the same men deep down.""

Karin Kneissl danced with Putin at her wedding last weekend and then made a deep curtsey to him, prompting an outcry in some local media which said she had undermined EU policy on Russia.
The EU imposed sanctions on Russia after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Relations between Moscow and the EU have been strained by other issues too.
""Our position in Europe did not change because of a wedding,"" Kurz told a news conference. ""Our foreign policy towards Russia is clear... We helped shape and are committed to all the European Union's decisions."" 
Kurz, whose conservatives govern in coalition with the far-right Freedom Party (FPO), moved some departments that deal with EU affairs from the foreign ministry to his own office when he became chancellor late last year to reassure member states of his government's pro-European intentions.
Kurz has said he hopes to improve EU ties with Russia through more intensive dialogue. Austria holds the EU's rotating six-month presidency until the end of the year and is expected to speak on behalf of the whole 28-nation bloc.
However, unlike most western European countries, Austria did not expel Russian diplomats over the poisoning in Britain of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter. Britain and its allies have blamed Russia, though it denies any involvement.
Kurz said he discussed EU-Russian ties and other issues with Putin during his short visit to Austria. He did not elaborate. 
Kneissl, who got her job on a Freedom Party ticket but is not a member of the FPO, invited Putin to her wedding when he visited Austria in June. She is on holiday this week, and has not commented on the media outcry.
FPO leader and Vice-Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache, whose party has a cooperation agreement with Putin's United Russia Party, said on Wednesday the Kremlin leader's visit had underlined his high regard for Austria. 

""That is something positive, and I think that many Austrians share this view,"" he said. Strache has called for ending the EU sanctions against Russia.

SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgaria's government approved an action plan on Wednesday that envisages the country entering the ""waiting room"" for euro membership and also joining the European Union's banking union by the end of June next year.
Bulgaria applied in July to enter the exchange rate mechanism (ERM-2), a mandatory two-year precursor to adopting the euro, after euro zone finance ministers and the European Central Bank gave Sofia the green light.
Bulgaria, whose lev currency has long been pegged to the euro via a currency board, is the first non-euro zone member to seek to join the banking union, which will allow the ECB to monitor its top lenders.
To enhance its chances, Sofia must improve its macro-financial framework, strengthen supervision of non-banking financial sector including pension funds and insurance firms, as well as working harder for combating money laundering.
It also needs to improve the bankruptcy legal framework after reviewing legislation and drafting the relevant legislative amendments.
""Implementation of the above measures will ensure compliance with pre-commitments in policy areas that are of major importance for the smooth transition to ERM-2 and the banking union by July 2019 and, as a result, the euro will be implemented,"" the center-right government said in a statement.
The ECB is expected to carry out an asset quality review and stress tests on Bulgarian banks before it gives its nod for entry in a process that may take a year, but could be longer, depending on the Black Sea nation’s progress.
With low inflation, budget surpluses and low public debt, Bulgaria already meets the nominal criteria for adopting the single currency.
But its economic output per capita is just half the EU average, and widespread graft widespread graft and troubles at some of its banks have cast a shadow over its euro prospects.
Its fourth largest bank collapsed in 2014 and just this week the liquidation of a Cyprus-based insurance company left some 200,000 Bulgarians without car insurance, prompting the resignation of the head of insurance supervision.

HANOI (Reuters) - A Vietnamese court found two Vietnamese-Americans guilty of terrorism on Wednesday and sentenced them to 14 years in prison for masterminding a series of bomb plots earlier this year, a court official told Reuters.
James Nguyen and Angel Phan were convicted, along with 10 accomplices who received short jail terms, after a two day trial. All defendants had been charged with ""attempting to overthrow the state"".
Phan and Nguyen had been accused of organizing at least three attacks, including the attempted bombing of Vietnam's largest international airport in Ho Chi Minh City last April, and the successful bombing of a police station in June this year.
""The remaining 10 defendants in the same trial received prison terms of between five and 11 years,"" an official at the Ho Chi Minh City People's Court told Reuters by phone. 
According to state media, Phan and Nguyen were acting on behalf of the ""Provisional Government of Vietnam"", a California-based organization run by Vietnamese-Americans still loyal to the now defunct state of South Vietnam.
The U.S. organization, which was listed as a ""terrorist"" group by Hanoi in January this year, dispatched Phan and Nguyen to Vietnam in February 2017 to carry out attacks on Vietnamese national holidays, the Ministry of Public Security said in a statement on its website.
Phan and Nguyen ran a network of underground operatives in Vietnam, some of whom were given titles in a shadow government such as ""governor of Saigon"", or ""commander of national defense guards,"" the Ministry of Public Security said on Wednesday. 
The pair assigned ""counter-revolutionary"" missions to the group's members in Vietnam, the ministry said, including a plan to broadcast anti-government propaganda from local radio stations, organize protests, and ""insult the image"" of former president Ho Chi Minh.
Phan and Nguyen will be deported after serving their jail term, Voice of Vietnam radio reported.
In June, a court in Ho Chi Minh City upheld prison sentences against 15 members of the group it said were guilty of planting bombs in the international terminal of Tan Son Nhat airport in April last year.
Last month, police said it had arrested seven people from the group over the bombing of a Ho Chi Minh City police station. 
The incident, in which two small explosive devices were detonated, injured three people in what police said was a ""terrorist case against the people's government"".
A police warehouse, where confiscated vehicles, mostly motorbikes, were stored, was also blown up. 
The Provisional Government of Vietnam did not respond to a request for comment made via its website.
In a statement, the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi said it had been providing consular services for James Nguyen.

""We will continue to monitor Mr. Nguyen's welfare, advocate for him, and provide consular services until his release,"" spokesman Pope Thrower said in the statement, which did not mention Angel Phan or address the terrorism charges.

A site with a sign outside saying it was a gearbox repair business contained machinery and components suspected to be used to make firearms and ammunition, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said.
""NCA investigators have discovered what they believe to be a sophisticated gun factory on an industrial estate in East Sussex,"" the agency - which specializes in fighting serious and organized crime - said on its website.
The arrests were made on Saturday after officers heard bangs which sounded like gunshots from inside the unit in the town of Hailsham. A taser was used in one of the arrests.
Two handguns and ammunition, and guns in various stages of production were also recovered.
The head of the NCA's National Firearms Threat Centre Rob Hickinbottom said the investigation was continuing. 
""We suspect that this operation has disrupted a group that would appear to be involved in the criminal production of firearms,"" he said.

Police said that the orange pills of methamphetamine, known as ""yaba"" or ""crazy drug"", were seized in Ayutthaya province, north of Bangkok, on Aug. 18.
Three Thais were arrested in connection with the seizure, police said. The drugs came from Shan State in northeast Myanmar, in an area under the control of an ethnic Wa militia force, police said.
The Narcotics Suppression Bureau displayed the haul, neatly packed into large container bags, at their headquarters.
Bureau commander Police Lieutenant General Sommai Kongvisaisuk said the drugs were destined for Malaysia and then on to markets around the world.
""It gets distributed to Europe, America, Australia, Japan, Singapore and Korea and will make a lot of money,"" he said.
The seizure is the latest big methamphetamine bust in the region. Record seizures of the stimulant have recently been made in Malaysia and Indonesia.
The production and trafficking of methamphetamine in Southeast Asia has reached ""alarming levels"", the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) warned in a May report.
Much of the methamphetamine produced in the region comes from lawless parts of Myanmar, in particular Shan State, which has long been known for the production of opium and its refined form, heroin.

In recent years, the drug syndicates have branched out into the production of methamphetamine.

BOA VISTA, Brazil (Reuters) - Expecting Venezuelan women are leaving their country due to lack of prenatal care, medicine and diapers and giving birth across the border in Brazil, where three Venezuelan babies are born every day.
""My baby would have died if I had stayed. There was no food or medicine, no doctors,"" said Maria Teresa Lopez as she fed her daughter Fabiola, who was born on Monday night by caesarian section in the maternity hospital of Boa Vista, the capital of Brazil's Roraima border state.
Lopez, 20, hitched 800 kilometers from her home in the Orinoco river delta to the Brazilian border five months ago. She is one of several hundred thousand Venezuelans who have fled the economic and political turmoil in their homeland, mostly to neighboring Colombia.
The massive influx of Venezuelans has overburdened social services in Roraima state and led to an increase in crime, prostitution, disease and incidents of xenophobia.
Births of Venezuelan babies at the Boa Vista maternity hospital surged to 566 last year and 571 in the first half of 2018, from 288 in 2016 when the flow of Venezuelan refugees began, the Roraima health department said. There were no births in 2015, it said.
Roraima health safety coordinator Daniela Souza said the state has only one maternity hospital and it is being stretched to the limit, with patients sleeping on cots in the corridors. Syringes, gloves and other supplies are running out, she said.
""There are 800 people coming across the border every day and many of the women and children need medical care,"" Souza said. The number of Venezuelans attended at the state's medical centers has risen from 700 in 2014 to 50,000 in 2017 and 45,000 in just the first three months of this year, she said.
The Brazilian government and Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Roraima's governor has asked Brazil's Supreme Court to close the border to be able to deal with the immigration crisis. The federal government in Brasilia has ruled that out on humanitarian grounds.
Carmen Jimenez, 33, who arrived from Ciudad Bolivar eight months pregnant and gave birth in the Boa Vista hospital, said she was amazed to see so many Venezuelan mothers there. 
""I won't go back to Venezuela until there is food and medicine, and the streets are safe again,"" she said holding her 4-day-old daughter, Amalia.
Lopez, a Warao Indian of the Orinoco delta, said she would only return to pick up her first daughter, who remained behind with her grandmother because she was too young for the arduous journey to the border.
Brazil has received her well and her husband found work doing odd jobs, painting and mowing lawns, Lopez said, as she fed her baby milk with a large syringe.
""There is nothing left for us there,"" she said. ""I did not get an ultrasound until I got to Brazil and it was free. I want to stay.""

KNOCK, Ireland (Reuters) - Bernie and Tom Byrne can barely conceal their excitement as they prepare for a visit to Ireland by Pope Francis that they hope will bring back the young believers that have deserted the Catholic church after decades of scandal.
Their grandfather Dominic was one of at least twenty-two people that claimed to see Mary, Joseph and John the Evangelist hovering near the gable end of the local church in the western Irish village of Knock on a rainy evening in August 1879.
Francis will pray at the Knock shrine as part of his two-day visit to Ireland this week, the first by a Pope in almost 40 years that have transformed the once staunchly Catholic country into a far more secular and liberal society. https://tmsnrt.rs/2N95yFI 
""Houses are being painted and streets are being scrubbed... trying to get everything ready for him, even though it's only a short visit,"" said Bernie, 74, who like his brother Tom, runs a small shop selling religious goods to the 1.5 million pilgrims that come to Knock each year.
""Because he is such a humble man, and a nice man, everybody is dying to have a look at him.""
Religion is still deeply embedded in the face of the Irish countryside - roadside grottos with statues of the Virgin Mary are a feature of almost every Irish town and village, with most erected in 1954 when the Vatican called for a Marian year of celebration and devotion.
Like many practicing Catholics across the country, the Byrne brothers hope the papal visit will bring back those that abandoned the church after its standing and influence collapsed over a string of clerical child sex abuse scandals.
""A lot of the youngsters are not going to church now at all, with all the scandal,"" said Tom.
""The church would have to change to accommodate younger people. Possibly, more than likely, they will have to ordain women priests because they have no priests at the moment to succeed the older priests that are here.""
""A-LA-CARTE CATHOLICS""
Pope Francis will be the second pope to visit Knock after Pope John Paul II said mass to a crowd of around 450,000 there in 1979. Organizers are expecting a crowd of around 45,000 for Francis.
The proportion of Catholics fell to 78 percent in the most recent census of 2016 from a peak of 95 percent in 1961. Many of those no longer practise, as seen by dwindling mass attendances and the fact that only half of all marriages last year were Catholic ceremonies compared to over 90 percent 20 years ago.
Still, another 500,000 people are expected to watch Pope Francis say mass in Dublin's Phoenix Park on Sunday, including Joe Towell who remembers the ""euphoric"" scenes in the park 39 years ago when Pope John Paul II prayed there.
Towell, 68, lives with his mother by the nearby O'Devaney gardens flats where he tends to the 1950's complex's statue of Mary. While some locals' cars have been stolen and homes broken into, nobody touches Mary, he says.
Excited about the visit of ""another extraordinary type of pope"", he sees Francis as bridging a generational gap that has opened between the conservative and liberal wings of the church.
""He's still preaching the same gospel as they've all been preaching. He's just got a little more understanding of the present way people are feeling,"" Towell said.
For other Catholics, the visit provides a boost to the faithful who are struggling with a social landscape changed beyond recognition by votes in recent years to remove constitutional blocks to abortion and gay marriage.
Ireland became the first country to adopt same-sex marriage by popular vote in a landslide 2015 referendum and last year ended one of the world's strictest abortion regimes by an even larger majority of 66 percent. 
""A lot of Catholics have gone a-la-carte, but being Catholic is very serious,"" said Marie Campbell, who joined thousands of pilgrims who scale Croagh Patrick in the western County Mayo every July in honor of Saint Patrick, Ireland's patron saint.
""Our Catholic faith stands for life. It's the very center of being Catholic. We cherish life, life is sacred, and a lot of Catholics need to be reminded of these things.""

HARARE (Reuters) - Hundreds gathered around screens outside Zimbabwe's top court on Wednesday to watch a legal showdown between President Emmerson Mnangagwa and the opposition leader challenging his July 30 election victory.
Hundreds of thousands more turned on their televisions to follow live footage of the Constitutional Court considering Nelson Chamisa's petition that the vote was flawed and should be overturned.
Riot police blocked roads leading to the court in the capital Harare and vehicles carrying water cannon parked nearby. 
Chamisa, 40, says the first vote since the removal of Robert Mugabe in November was rigged by a biased electoral commission. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) and Mnangagwa say there was no foul play.
The nine judges could throw the case out, declare a new winner or order a fresh election within 60 days.
Wednesday's hearing has been cast as a major test of the independence of the highest court whose verdict is final.
""MOST IMPORTANT CASE""
""The jurisprudential and political burden that weighs heavily on the shoulders of each of the Constitutional Court judges today is that they are about to adjudicate by far the most important case of their legal careers,"" Welshman Ncube, a Chamisa ally and constitutional lawyer wrote on Twitter.
Before the hearing started at around 10 a.m. (0800 GMT), Chamisa's lawyers accused Zimbabwe's Justice Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi of refusing to issue temporary work permits to three South African members of their team. 
The judges let the three keep working in the team in court. Ziyambi declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
The election had been expected to end Zimbabwe's pariah status and launch an economic recovery, but post-vote unrest has left the country deeply divided and brought back uncomfortable reminders of its violent past.
Mnangagwa has urged Zimbabwe to unite behind him but questions remain over the death of six people in an army crackdown on protests against the ruling party's victory.

Chamisa earlier this week said the high stakes court case was only one of the many routes he would take ""to protect the people's vote"" and said if he lost, he would consider peaceful street protests against Mnangagwa.

903,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 06:22AM ET</span>","Trump adviser Bolton says Russia 'stuck' in Syria, Iran must leave","By Dan Williams
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Russia is ""stuck"" in Syria and looking for others to fund post-war reconstruction there, U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton said, describing this as an opportunity for Washington to press for Iranian forces to quit the country.
Bolton, speaking to Reuters while on a visit to Israel, said U.S. contacts with Russia did not include any understanding over a push by Damascus's forces against the rebels in Idlib. But he warned against any use of chemical or biological weapons there.
Under President Donald Trump, the United States has sought to disengage from Syria, where the previous administration deployed some troops and gave limited support to rebel Kurdish forces over the objections of NATO partner Turkey.
Bolton sidestepped a question on whether these measures would continue, saying the U.S. was staying in Syria to carry out some specific objectives.
""Our interests in Syria are to finish the destruction of the ISIS (Islamic State) territorial caliphate and deal with the continuing threat of ISIS terrorism and to worry about the presence of Iranian militias and regular forces,"" he said in an interview.
At a news conference in Jerusalem on Wednesday, Bolton voiced support for Israeli strikes in recent months on sites in Syria where he said Iranian-supplied missiles and other ""threatening weapons"" had been deployed.
""I think that's a legitimate act of self-defense on the part of Israel,"" he said.
""FRENETIC ACTIVITY""
Russia, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's big-power backer, says it is committed to destroying Islamic State insurgents but has been more circumspect about the involvement of Iran, another foreign power reinforcing Damascus.
Bolton said that Russian President Vladimir Putin, who met Trump in Helsinki on July 16, had told the United States that Moscow could not compel the Iranians to leave Syria. 
""But he also told us that his interest and Iran's were not exactly the same. So we're obviously going to talk to him about what role they can play,"" said Bolton, who meets his Russian counterpart, Nikolai Patrushev, in Geneva on Thursday.
""We're going see what we and others can agree in terms of resolving the conflict in Syria. But the one prerequisite there is the withdrawal of all Iranian forces back in Iran.""
Washington wields leverage in its talks with Moscow because ""the Russians are stuck there at the moment,"" Bolton said.
""And I don't think they want to be stuck there. I think their frenetic diplomatic activity in Europe indicates that they'd like to find somebody else, for example, to bear the cost of reconstructing Syria - which they may or may not succeed in doing.""
The Idlib region, a refuge for civilians and rebels displaced from other areas of Syria as well as powerful jihadist forces, was hit by a wave of air strikes and shelling this month, in a possible prelude to a full-scale government offensive.
Asked if there was any U.S.-Russian understanding about such an operation, Bolton said: ""No. But we're very concerned as we look at the military situation and we want to be unmistakably clear to Assad that we expect there will be no use of chemical weapons or biological weapons if there are any additional military hostilities in Idlib.""
In April, the Trump administration mustered a coalition of U.S., French and British forces to attack Syrian government facilities related to the production of chemical weapons after a poison gas attack killed dozens of people in Douma district.
Damascus, endorsed by Moscow, has denied using such weapons. 
Asked how the United States might respond should there be a chemical or biological attack on Idlib, Bolton said only: ""strongly"".

Repeating that warning at the news conference, he added: ""They (the Syrians) really ought to think about this a long time before they come to any decision.""

904,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 06:22AM ET</span>",U.S. not discussing recognition of Israel's Golan hold: Bolton,"By Dan Williams
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The Trump administration is not discussing possible U.S. recognition of Israel's claim of sovereignty over the Golan Heights, U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton said. 
Israel captured much of the Golan from Syria in a 1967 war and annexed it in a move not endorsed internationally. In May, a senior Israeli official said that U.S. recognition could be forthcoming within months.
""I've heard the idea being suggested but there's no discussion of it, no decision within the U.S. government,"" Bolton told Reuters during a visit to Israel. ""Obviously we understand the Israeli claim that it has annexed the Golan Heights - we understand their position - but there's no change in the U.S. position for now.""
Palestinians seek other territories that Israel occupied in 1967 - the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem - for a future state. U.S.-backed talks on that goal stalled in 2014. 
The Trump administration has tried to restart the diplomacy but has been cold-shouldered by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas since it recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital last December. 
Washington has also signaled possible accommodation with Israel's West Bank settlements, dropping the term ""occupied"" from some U.S. documentation about the territory. Most world powers deem the settlements illegal. 
Asked whether the Trump administration envisaged Palestinian statehood as the way forward, Bolton sounded circumspect.
""I think it's been the U.S. view for a long time that ultimately Israelis and Palestinians are going to have to agree on this,"" he said. ""Nobody's going to impose a peace in that respect.""
Whether peace talks with Abbas could resume was ""up to him,"" Bolton said.
The Trump adviser was more forthright about Washington's trimming of funds for United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which extends aid to Palestinians displaced by the 1948 war of Israel's founding and to millions of their descendants. 
""UNRWA is a failed mechanism. It violates standard international law on the status of refugees. UNRWA's program is the only one in history based on the assumption that refugee status is hereditary, and I think it is long overdue that we have taken steps to reduce funding,"" Bolton said.
UNRWA and the Palestinians have warned that the cuts could exacerbate hardship in Gaza, an enclave that has been under Israeli and Egypt blockades designed to isolate its Islamist Hamas rulers. Abbas, Hamas' Palestinian rival, has also restricted funding to Gaza.
Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, sought to place the onus for Gaza's plight on Hamas, and disputed the linkage between the UNRWA budget and Palestinian wellbeing.
""Much of UNRWA's expenses really go to perpetuating the refugee status of the Palestinian people, and I think that's a mistake. I think it's a mistake from a humanitarian point of view ... a perpetuation of an unnatural status,"" he said.
""I think what we want to see for Palestinians is real, gainful employment,"" Bolton said, echoing calls by Washington and Israel for economic betterment of the West Bank and Gaza. 
""Unless you have functioning economies, you are never going to have social and political stability.""

905,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 06:21AM ET</span>",Congo approves more experimental Ebola treatments as cases rise,"KINSHASA (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo has approved four more experimental treatments against the deadly Ebola virus, the health ministry said as it raced to contain an outbreak in its violence-torn east.
Health authorities last week started administering the U.S.-developed mAb114 treatment to Ebola patients, the first time such a treatment had been used against an active outbreak.
The health ministry said in a daily bulletin late on Tuesday that the 10 patients who received mAb114 since Aug. 11 have experienced a ""positive evolution"", but the outbreak has continued to grow. 
The four additional treatments approved by Congo's ethics committee are Remdesivir, made by Israel's Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD); ZMapp, an intravenous treatment made by San Diego's Mapp Pharmaceutical; Japanese drug Favipiravir; and one referred to as Regn3450 – 3471 – 3479. 
Remdesivir was administered to its first patient in the town of Beni on Tuesday, who is doing well, the ministry said in its bulletin.
Six new cases and four new deaths have been confirmed from the haemmorhagic fever, which causes vomiting and severe diarrhea, the ministry said. 
That brings the total number of deaths to 59 and confirmed cases to 75 since last month.
Congo, whose heavily forested interior makes its a natural home for Ebola, is at the forefront of a global campaign to combat the virus, which killed more than 11,000 people when it swept through West Africa from 2013-2016. 
The Central African country has experienced ten Ebola outbreaks since the virus was discovered in northern Congo in 1976 - more than twice as many as any other country - and 33 people died in a flare-up in the northwest that ended last month. 
In addition, a vaccine manufactured by Merck (NYSE:MRK), which proved effective against the earlier outbreak in northwestern Congo, has been administered to 1,693 health workers and contacts of Ebola patients.
Insecurity in Congo's eastern borderlands with Uganda has continued to complicate the response, with some contacts of Ebola patients located in so-called ""red-zones"", which are off limits to emergency responders due to militia activity.

Instead, local health workers in those areas are monitoring the contacts and no Ebola cases have yet been confirmed there.

KABUL (Reuters) - A ban on dozens of Afghan strongmen and lawmakers from running for parliament because of suspected links to illegal armed groups has spurred threats to disrupt a general election already at risk from worsening security.
The October polls, seen as an important test of Afghanistan's democratic legitimacy and a dry run for a presidential election next year, have been repeatedly delayed because of organizational problems.
""There will be riots, protests and road-blockages if they don't accept me,"" said Assadullah Sharifi, a lawmaker who is among 35 people the Electoral Complaints Commission (ECC) has barred from standing.
""I will do whatever it takes to contest elections,"" said Sharifi, who is close to the powerful former governor of the northern province of Balkh, Atta Mohammad Noor. 
Afghanistan has for generations been plagued by the problem of powerful provincial figures defying central authority, taxing whatever business they can and maintaining private forces.
The United Nations, which is overseeing the election, has welcomed the decision to vet candidates in preparation for the Oct. 20 election.
Even without dozens of angry candidates to contend with, election authorities face daunting insecurity. The Taliban have warned people not to vote and dozens of people have been killed in militant attacks on voter registration centers.
'PROVE ME GUILTY'
Election Commission officials trying to weed out candidates with links to illegal groups point to the limited influence that parties have in politics, and in elections in particular, meaning candidates have traditionally run as independents, with few checks on their records.
This year's bans have for the first time highlighted ties between politicians and armed groups, to the fury of excluded candidates.
Some of them have shut down election commission offices and launched anti-government protests.
Sharifi rejected the accusations leveled by voters in his constituency of ties to an illegal militia and of violent crime.
""I am ready to surrender before the top court if they can prove me guilty,"" he told Reuters.
Electoral officials this month summoned and questioned more than 100 hopeful candidates against whom complaints had been lodged, mostly by the public, eventually banning the 35.
Many of those questioned said that while they may have hired armed bodyguards, in a country plagued by militant violence and kidnapping for ransom, that did not mean they were linked to proscribed group.
Another of the banned candidates, Mullah Tarakhel, a powerful lawmaker from Kabul, suggested that his supporters could cause trouble.
""The ECC has committed a blunder by not allowing me to stand for elections. My supporters can stop the vote,"" Tarakhel told a news channel.
Tarakhel was not available for comment and his aide declined to discuss the issue.
One policeman was killed and one wounded in a suicide bomb attack this month during a protest by Tarakhel's supporters in Kabul. There was no claim of responsibility.
'ATTACKING US'
President Ashraf Ghani's office, election officials and diplomats have tried to intervene to defuse tension but electoral officials say they still face danger.
""Our officials collected evidence to prove their links with criminals and underground armed groups,"" said Alireza Rohani, spokesman and secretary at the ECC. 
""We have nothing personal against them, but they are attacking us."" 
Ghani, who is widely expected to run for a second five-year term in 2019, is under pressure from his international allies to hold the parliamentary elections and bolster democracy.
But some of the banned lawmakers accuse Ghani of using the ECC to sideline lawmakers who oppose him.
""President Ghani wants to kick us out of parliament,"" said Fawzia Koofi, who along with her sister, Mariam, has been banned because of suspected links with an illegal militia. The sisters deny any links.
""He wants to fill the parliament with his aides,"" she said.

An official in Ghani's office dismissed the suggestion Ghani was using the ban to sideline opponents, saying the electoral commission was independent did not take orders from the government.

Brunson is at the center of a row between Turkey and the United States, which has exacerbated a crisis in Turkey's lira and reverberated across global markets.
The evangelical pastor, who has lived in Turkey for two decades, has been detained for 21 months on terrorism charges, which he denies. He is under house arrest.
""Once the upper court's rejection has been confirmed in writing we will apply to the constitutional court,"" lawyer Ismail Cem Halavurt said in comments reported by Turkey's Hurriyet newspaper that he confirmed to Reuters.
Once domestic legal avenues are exhausted, if necessary the defense would then apply to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), he said.
""We are hopeful regarding the constitutional court, but if it is rejected there, we will go to the ECHR without hesitation,"" he said.
The court in Turkey's Izmir province which last week rejected the appeal said evidence was still being collected and the pastor posed a flight risk, according to a copy of the court ruling seen by Reuters.
Abdulkadir Selvi, a Hurriyet newspaper columnist close to the government, likened the constitutional court appeal plan to the case of journalist Mehmet Altan, who took a similar course of action and was released in June after being jailed on charges of aiding coup plotters.
Brunson is accused of terrorism charges and aiding the network of a U.S.-based Islamic preacher blamed by Ankara for masterminding a coup attempt in July 2016 against President Tayyip Erdogan.
In an interview with Reuters on Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would give Turkey no concessions in return for the release of Brunson. Ankara has not responded to Trump's comments.

Trump, who counts evangelical Christians among his core supporters, has become a vocal champion of the pastor's case.

Ahmad Khatami also told worshippers attending Eid prayers in Tehran that President Donald Trump’s offer of talks with Iranian leaders was unacceptable as the U.S. leader wanted Tehran to concede on its missile program and regional influence.
""Americans say you should accept what we say in the talks. So this is not negotiation, but dictatorship. The Islamic Republic and the Iranian nation would stand up against dictatorship,"" Khatami was quoted as saying by Mizan news agency.
""The price of a war with Iran is very high for America. They know if they harm this country and this state in the slightest way, the United States and its main ally in the region, the Zionist regime (Israel), would be targeted,"" Khatami said.
Iran has said it could target Israeli cities with missiles if it is threatened. Iran also has proxies in the region, including Lebanon's Hezbollah group.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Tuesday Iran's military prowess was what deterred Washington from attacking it, and vowed to boost Iran's military might.
The Trump administration reimposed sanctions on Iran this month after withdrawing from the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran, saying it was too soft on Tehran and would not stop it developing a nuclear bomb.
Washington imposed new sanctions in August, targeting Iran's car industry, trade in gold and other precious metals, and purchases of U.S. dollars. Trump has said the United States will issue another round of tougher sanctions in November that will target Iran's oil sales and banking sector.
Trump's national security adviser told Reuters on Wednesday that the U.S. president wanted maximum pressure on Iran.
""There should not be any doubt that the United States wants this resolved peacefully, but we are fully prepared for any contingency that Iran creates,"" John Bolton said.
The Iranian vice president said on Wednesday the United States and Israel, ""the sworn enemies of the Islamic Republic"", had created economic problems but Iran would overcome them with the help of its allies and ""smart diplomacy"".
""Iran's oil exports and its revenues are stable and we don't have any problem in providing the basic goods to people,"" Eshaq Jahangiri was quoted as saying by the state news agency IRNA.
A number of protests have broken out in Iran in recent months over high prices, unpaid wages, unemployment and regular power cuts.

Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has rejected Trump's offer of unconditional talks on a new nuclear deal, prompting Trump to tell Reuters in an interview on Monday: ""If they want to meet, that's fine, and if they don't want to meet, I couldn't care less.""

BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China expects self-ruled Taiwan's last diplomatic ally in Africa, the Kingdom of eSwatini, will switch to Beijing soon, a senior Chinese diplomat said on Wednesday, a day after China won over a third Taipei ally this year.
Taiwan, which China claims as a wayward province with no right to state-to-state relations, now has formal ties with only 17 countries, almost all small, less developed nations in Central America and the Pacific, including Belize and Nauru.
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who has vowed not to bow to Chinese pressure, came under opposition criticism on Wednesday amid calls for a more friendlier policy towards Beijing. 
Taiwan vowed on Tuesday to fight China's ""increasingly out of control"" behavior after Taipei lost another ally to Beijing when El Salvador became the third country to switch allegiances to China this year.
Ahead of next month's summit between China and African leaders in Beijing, China has been upping the pressure on Taiwan's last remaining ally on the continent, eSwatini, formerly known as Swaziland, to come over to China's side, diplomatic sources say.
Briefing reporters in Beijing about the summit, Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Chen Xiaodong that eSwatini did not have relations with China ""for reasons that everyone knows"".
""We look forward to and hope that all African nations, with none left behind, can take part in positive China-Africa cooperation, and become a member of the largest family get together,"" Chen said. 
""I believe that this is not just the pursuit of China, it is also a widespread shared expectation of African nations. I believe that this target can in the not too distant future be realized,"" he added, without elaborating.
Speaking on Monday, eSwatini government spokesman Percy Simelane said he was unaware of any plans about China.
""Up until or otherwise told we remain with Taiwan,"" he said.
Foreign Affairs Minister Mgwagwa Gamedze told Reuters he will have a clearer picture on the country's position next Monday, adding that he still has to meet the king on the issue. He did not elaborate.
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry referred Reuters to a comment from Foreign Minister Joseph Wu on Tuesday, where he said ties with eSwatini were ""extremely firm"".
In Washington, a State Department spokesman said they were ""deeply disappointed"" by El Salvador's decision to break ties with Taiwan and it was reviewing its relationship with San Salvador as a result.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said nobody had the right to criticize the move, pointing out Washington had done the same four decades earlier.
'ENORMOUS MISTAKE' 
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has vowed not to bow to Chinese pressure, Taipei has accused Beijing of offering generous aid and loan packages to lure its allies across, charges China denies.
The island's biggest opposition group, the China-friendly Kuomintang (KMT), urged a ""better alternative"" following what it described as ""enormous mistakes"" in Tsai's policy towards China. ""The ruling party has the responsibility to think of a better cross-strait policy...Relations with China have turned stagnant and are frozen,"" KMT spokesman Mong-kai Hung told Reuters. 
Yu-fang Lin, a KMT lawmaker who leads the diplomacy and defense committee in Taiwan's parliament, urged Tsai to recognize the ""one China"" principle, an agreement reached between Beijing and then-ruling KMT government in 1992, under which both agreed there is only one China, with each having their own interpretation of what that means.
China's hostility to Taiwan has grown since Tsai's election as Beijing fears she wishes to push for the island's formal independence, a red line for China. She says she wants to maintain the status quo but will defend Taiwan's democracy.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - A boat disaster near Thailand's Phuket Island that killed 47 Chinese last month is significantly cutting arrival numbers from China, though the Thai tourism industry is hopeful the decline will be stemmed by late this year. 
The July 5 capsizing of the Phoenix was Thailand's worst tourist-related disaster in years. China is Thailand's biggest source of visitors, and last year accounted for nearly one-third of the record 35.38 million arrivals. 
During July, Chinese arrivals fell 0.9 percent from a year earlier, the first drop since the start of 2017, when the Thai government was cracking down on cheap tour packages from China.
The Thai tourism ministry expects a bigger decline of 14.3 percent for August. 
And the ministry cut its target for Chinese arrivals in July-December by 669,000, or 11.5 percent, to 5.15 million. 
Virat Chatturaputpitak, vice president of the Association of Thai Travel Agents, said he expects numbers to recover during China's ""Golden Week"" holiday in October, when many citizens travel en masse.
""They'll return in October,"" he said.
For sure, the boat deaths have cut Chinese arrivals in Phuket, a popular island resort.
""This is the lowest point in my 20 years working with the Chinese,"" said Apicharn Pasomsap, an airport transfer operator who caters to Chinese tour groups.
""We're all waiting around for clients that don't arrive."" 
The number of hotel rooms in Phuket taken by Chinese in July and August has been 30 percent lower than usual, according to the Thai Hotels Association.
The Tourism Authority of Thailand said six Chinese airlines have canceled a total of 19 flights to Phuket, or about 6 percent of weekly arrivals.
AVOIDING THE WATER
Zhou Min, 33, an English teacher from China's Yunan province, still visited Phuket for two days recently, but didn't go on the water.
""My husband didn't allow me to go out to the sea because the accident influenced us and we were a little scared,"" she said.
After the disaster, Thai Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan blamed Chinese tour operators for disregarding Thai safety regulations, prompting a backlash from Chinese netizens. He later apologized. 
In July, China issued statements reminding outbound tourists to guard against safety risks, with mentions of the Phuket incident. 
Local Thai authorities say they have increased safety checks on boats. 

Yuthasak Supasorn, Tourism Authority of Thailand governor, told Reuters the boat disaster ""has affected our image and what's most important now is we have to focus on restoring tourist confidence and our safety image.""

No group has claimed responsibility for the attack but Islamic State militants operate in the area.
A militant wearing a suicide vest blew himself up just after midnight at Adnan al-Ganam's house in the village of Asdira, Colonel Khalil al-Sahn, the police chief of surrounding Shirqat district, told Reuters.
Those killed were members of the Tribal Mobilisation Forces, a network of Sunni militias that back the government in its fight against Islamic State, he said.
The village is north of Tikrit, the capital of Iraq's Salahuddin province.
Islamic State, which had seized control of much of northern Iraq in 2014, lost Shirqat to U.S.-backed Iraqi security forces supported by Sunni tribal fighters in 2016. 
A small number of militants are still operating in the area and are capable of launching sporadic attacks, security officials say.
Iraq declared victory over Islamic State in December but security officials say the militants are likely to wage an insurgency after their self-proclaimed caliphate collapsed and they were dislodged from all the territory they held.
Its fighters have kept up a campaign of kidnap and killing, mainly in the provinces of Kirkuk, Diyala and Salahuddin.

About 100,000 mostly peaceful protesters rallied against the Social Democrat (PSD) government on Aug. 10. 
Riot police used a water cannon and tear gas against the crowd and more than 450 people needed medical assistance and dozens were taken to hospital. 
Some protesters threw bottles and rocks at riot police but multiple video recordings show police beating non-violent protesters holding their hands up.
""I saw a failed coup d'etat,"" PSD leader Liviu Dragnea told private television station Antena 3 in his first public appearance since the protest. 
Dragnea holds a tight grip over the ruling party but cannot be premier because of a previous conviction in a vote-rigging case. In June, the Supreme Court sentenced him to three and a half years in prison for inciting others to abuse of office. He denied the charges and has appealed the verdict. 
Centrist President Klaus Iohannis condemned the disproportionate use of force by police but Dragnea said the criticism undermined police and incited protesters to violence.
Dragnea said he would want to impeach Iohannis, provided he got the support of the junior ruling coalition party ALDE. 
More than 380 people and rights groups have filed criminal complaints against riot police since the protest, and prosecutors said they have opened 22 cases.
Anti-government protests have occurred continuously since the Social Democrats took power last year and repeatedly attempted to weaken anti-corruption legislation. On Tuesday, Dragnea accused multinational corporations and banks of financing and encouraging protests. 
Anti-corruption group Transparency International ranks Romania among the European Union's most corrupt states and Brussels is keeping its justice system under special monitoring.
Dragnea also said four men tried to kill him in 2017.
""I had an assassination attempt last year, four foreigners came, they were here three weeks. I found out who paid them, but I cannot say the name, a person who is famous in the world.""
Asked whether he was thinking about U.S. financier George Soros, he said: ""I am not thinking about Soros, he is thinking of me."" 

A tendency to demonize Soros, a Hungarian-American financier who funds liberal charities and non-governmental organizations worldwide through his Open Society Foundations, is common across Central and Eastern European states such as Hungary and Poland where illiberal democracies are on the rise.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Britain and Japan canceled a plan for a simulated amphibious beach assault near Mount Fuji this week that would have been the first joint drill between their troops in Japan, officials said on Wednesday, as a typhoon approached the Japanese mainland.
Typhoon Cimaron, which is heading north from the western Pacific, is expected to bring strong winds and rain to Japan over the next few days.
Britain and Japan had planned for a Royal Marine detachment and Japanese amphibious troops to storm the beach from boats launched from the British Navy's flagship amphibious assault carrier HMS Albion on Friday.
The cancellation was announced by Britain's embassy in Japan and the Ministry of Defence in Tokyo.
The Albion has operated in and around Japanese waters for several weeks, including patrols to help enforce United Nations sanctions on North Korea, as Britain seeks to bolster defense ties with Japan as it prepares to exit the European Union.
London is eager for a presence in a region that is driving global economic growth, while Tokyo wants to nurture defense ties beyond its traditional ally, the United States, as it contends with China's growing military.
A Japanese destroyer and helicopters had also been assigned to the exercise in addition to the participation of Japan's first marine unit since World War Two, the Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade.
Activated in April, the 1,500-strong force backed up by helicopter carriers, amphibious ships, Osprey tilt-rotor troop carriers and amphibious assault vehicles was formed to counter any threats against islands along the edge of the East China Sea that Tokyo worries could be vulnerable to attack by China.
However, its existence is controversial because critics warn amphibious units could theoretically be used against Japan’s neighbors in breach of a post-World War Two constitution that renounces the right to wage war.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is ""deeply disappointed"" by El Salvador's decision to break diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favor of China and is reviewing its relationship with San Salvador as a result, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department said on Tuesday.
El Salvador on Monday became the third Latin American country in the past two years to switch allegiances from Taipei to Beijing and said attracting investment and developing the economy were key goals behind the decision.
""Although we recognize the sovereign right of every country to determine its diplomatic relations, we are deeply disappointed by this decision,"" said a spokesman for the U.S. State Department, who did not want to be identified by name. 
""We are reviewing our relationship with El Salvador following this decision,"" he said.
The official did not elaborate.
The U.S. ambassador in El Salvador, Jean Manes, posted on Twitter earlier that the United States was analyzing the ""worrisome"" decision and that it would impact relations between the two countries. She also did not elaborate.
U.S. relations with El Salvador have been strained over President Donald Trump's threats to cut aid from countries that ""do nothing"" to stop MS-13 gang members from crossing illegally into the United States. 
Manes said at an event on Tuesday Salvadorans should demand transparency about how their government resolved to swap diplomatic partners.
""I think you should know, exactly, all the details of the negotiation,"" she said.
The United States, which is currently locked in a major trade dispute with China, its main strategic rival in Asia, also has formal diplomatic relations with Beijing, rather than Taipei. However, it is required by law to help Taiwan with self-defense and is the island's primary source of weapons.
The State Department official said China’s efforts to unilaterally alter the status quo with Taiwan were harmful and ""undermine the framework that has enabled peace, stability, and development for decades."" 
""The United States urges China to abstain from coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic system, of the people on Taiwan,"" he said. Taiwan was a democratic success story, a reliable partner, and a force for good in the world, the official said.
""The United States will continue to support Taiwan as it seeks to expand its already significant contributions to addressing global challenges, and as Taiwan resists efforts to constrain its appropriate participation on the world stage,"" he said.
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said on Monday the island would not bow to pressure after she made a high-profile trip to Latin America last week that included stops in the United States, which drew criticism from China.
In March, Trump signed legislation that encourages the United States to send senior officials to Taiwan to meet Taiwanese counterparts and vice versa.

While Tsai was not invited to the United States for an official visit last week, she met U.S. senators while she was there, attended banquets with overseas Taiwanese and spoke of the need for strong ties with Washington.

CANBERRA (Reuters) - A second challenge to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's leadership loomed on Wednesday, a day after Turnbull rejected the resignations of seven Cabinet members who had backed a rival who is openly preparing a new bid.
Former home affairs minister Peter Dutton said he was again canvassing colleagues in the Liberal Party, the senior partner in the government coalition, just a day after Turnbull survived his initial challenge for the leadership in a party-room vote.
The narrow margin of his victory - Turnbull defeated Dutton 48 votes to 35 - only heightened speculation that his leadership days were numbered in a country that has earned a reputation for having a revolving door of political leaders.
Australian newspapers echoed the frustration many voters feel over the constant leadership changes.
""The rest of Australia is looking on at the antics of the coalition caucus in disbelief,"" The Sydney Morning Herald wrote.
""It would be kinder to voters and more in the national interest if Mr Turnbull ... called an election a year early,"" it said in an editorial.
Turnbull won a narrow election victory in 2016 and the next poll is due by May.
Expectations that Turnbull would soon face another challenge, possibly within days, were stoked when eight Cabinet ministers backed Dutton in Tuesday's challenge.
Dutton soon confirmed those expectations and declared on Wednesday he was working to secure the seven party votes he needs to become Australia's sixth prime minister since 2009.
""I'm speaking to colleagues,"" Dutton told 3AW Radio.
""If I believe the majority of colleagues support me then I will consider my position,"" he said.
FRACTURED PARTY
Desperate to unite the fractured Liberal Party, Turnbull asked most of the Cabinet rebels, including two senior ministers, to remain in their posts after Dutton's initial challenge, Turnbull's party deputy and Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said.
Only the resignations of Dutton and Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, the former minister for international development and the Pacific, were accepted.
Further political instability is now all but guaranteed in the final two days of parliament's sitting before it breaks until September, upsetting Australia's financial markets.
Australia's stock market was down more than 0.5 percent on Wednesday, with the index hitting a nine-day low.
Market sentiment was further soured when the upper house Senate rejected the government's planned corporate tax cuts on Wednesday, one of Turnbull's most important policy planks that echoed a similar move by U.S. President Donald Trump.
Turnbull's leadership came to a head with the weakening of the government's centerpiece energy policy, which had included the imposition of a target of a 26 percent reduction in greenhouse emissions from Australia's energy generators, an issue that has repeatedly divided the government.
Turnbull came to power in a party-room coup in September 2015 over former premier Tony Abbott, who also survived an internal leadership contest before his eventual defeat.
A social liberal and multi-millionaire former merchant banker, Turnbull rode an early wave of popular support but he has struggled to appeal to conservative voters.
Progressive supporters have also been disappointed as they watched government policies shift to the right as Turnbull tried to appease a powerful right-leaning backbench.
Dutton, a hardline conservative who has carved out his reputation by overseeing Australia's harsh immigration policy, is unpopular with moderate voters, raising the possibility that a third, centrist candidate might emerge.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The top commander of U.S. troops in South Korea said on Wednesday he supports moves to withdraw some outposts along the fortified border with North Korea, despite the risks.
South Korea’s defense ministry has said it plans to reduce guard posts and equipment along the demilitarized zone (DMZ) on its border with North Korea as part of efforts to reduce tension and build trust with its northern neighbor.
""I have some concerns about what that means militarily for the ability to defend along the Military Demarcation Line,"" U.S. General Vincent Brooks told reporters on Wednesday. 
But he said that the risk is ""a reasonable degree"" and the move represents a good opportunity to reduce tensions.
About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea, a legacy of the Korean War, which ended in 1953 in an armistice that left the North Korea technically still at war with South Korea and the U.S.-led United Nations command.
Besides serving as the commander of those troops, Brooks also commands U.N. forces, and in the case of war, would take command of South Korean troops as well.
Brooks said that his troops are finding ""other ways"" to maintain readiness in the absence of major military drills, which were canceled or delayed by U.S. President Donald Trump as part of a deal with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un. 
""I received no order to become unready,"" he said. ""Nobody told me to stand down."" 
When Trump announced the plan after his summit with Kim in Singapore in June, a spokeswoman for U.S. military forces in Korea said at the time they had not received any direction to cease joint military drills.
When asked on Wednesday if he had advance warning of Trump's June announcement, Brooks said as a commander in the field he had no expectation that he would be briefed on the president's plans.
""Orders come in many different ways,"" he said. ""So for a military commander it’s not a matter of debate, it’s a matter of implementation.""
Brooks did not elaborate on how his command had adjusted to the changes in military exercises.

He credited the military presence in South Korea with ""successfully"" setting the stage for this year's diplomatic talks with North Korea, and said he supports maintaining pressure on North Korea to prevent it from ""backing up"" on diplomatic steps.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's next government will look to fintech companies and large corporate banks to increase financial inclusion in the country, where only one-third of adults have a bank account, senior officials said on Tuesday.
Arturo Herrera, one of two future deputy finance ministers, said in an interview that the lack of financial inclusion was one of the biggest obstacles in the new government's fight against poverty, inequality and slow economic growth.
Leftist President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who is scheduled to take office on Dec. 1, has made spreading the wealth more evenly a priority of his administration.
Herrera said fintechs, commercial and government-controlled banks all had a part to play in improving access to financial products and services, arguing that a ""lack of depth"" in the sector was hampering progress.
""We will still have to create, or help create, a basic infrastructure that enables transactions between people or between people and financial institutions in some of the most rural, most disconnected areas of the country,"" he said.
Telecommunications companies and convenience stores would be consulted to help build such infrastructure, he said.
His said his team was also examining how to develop digital banking services, and could revisit Mexico's fintech law in a bid to improve financial inclusion. 
Federal officials are reviewing the law, which passed Congress in March.
Despite several efforts, financial inclusion in Mexico has not increased significantly in recent years.
A 2015 assessment by Mexico's banking regulator found that 44 percent of adults had a bank account but two-thirds of them were saving in informal ways.
Fintechs have relied on technology to deliver financial services, often leapfrogging traditional banking infrastructure such as branch offices, cash machines and personal attention.
""The next step is to speak to the commercial banking sector to understand what characteristics would help them consider this as a profitable segment or one that could become profitable in the future,"" Herrera said.
He said state-owned development banks must become ""more efficient, more dynamic"" and be held to strict criteria when measuring progress on financial inclusion.
Gerardo Esquivel, the other incoming deputy finance minister, said that to find more efficient solutions to fight poverty and inequality, welfare programs would likely be combined or restructured to avoid duplications.

""There will be deep reforms in social programs,"" he said.

Chinese President Xi Jinping and Modi agreed in April to open a new chapter in ties, just months after a dispute over a stretch of their high-altitude Himalayan border rekindled fears of war.
Wei told Modi that China and India had a long-standing friendship, China's Defence Ministry said in a statement late on Tuesday.
He said Modi's trip would deepen security exchanges, strengthen mutual trust, help protect peace on their border and make a positive contribution toward developing their partnership, the ministry said.
Wei is also scheduled to meet Indian Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, where they will further discuss the border, the statement said. 
Hundreds of troops from both sides were deployed in 2017 on the Doklam plateau, near the borders of India, its ally Bhutan, and China after India objected to Chinese construction of a road in the Himalayan area in their most serious standoff in years.

There is still deep mistrust between the two giant neighbors over their festering border dispute, which triggered a brief war in 1962.

CARACAS (Reuters) - A major earthquake of magnitude 7.3 struck Venezuela's eastern coast, home to largely poor fishing communities, on Tuesday afternoon, shaking buildings as far away as Colombian capital Bogota and knocking power out in parts of Trinidad. 
Venezuelan officials said there were no immediate reports of injuries and two sources at state oil company PDVSA told Reuters the OPEC member's refineries and oil fields were operating normally. PDVSA did not immediately comment. 
But fretful Venezuelans with relatives close to the epicenter said they were struggling to contact their family members due to shaky phone lines.
And Venezuela is not in good shape to deal with a natural disaster. It is already wrestling with a crippling economic crisis - medicine is running short, hospitals are barely functioning and there are severe shortages of basics like chicken and milk.
The tremor - one of the country's strongest ever - hit at 5.31 p.m (2131 GMT). Along Venezuela's picturesque palm tree-dotted northern coast, residents said the long quake was terrifying and led people to dash into the streets.
""I had gotten into bed to watch the news on TV and my bed started to move as if it was made of water,"" said Elia Sanchez, a doctor in Cumana, the capital of the eastern state of Sucre that was the closest to the offshore epicenter. ""We had to go down nine floors, it felt like it would never end."" 
Rosymer Rodriguez, also in Cumana, said she could not see any significant damage but that people were still fearful. 
""There are still people in the street. There are people packing bags in case there are aftershocks,"" said Rodriguez.
The governor of Sucre told state television that so far there were no reports of deaths or major damage. He called for calm. 
""Do not fall victim to psychological terror, messages about a tsunami and all that,"" said governor Edwin Rojas, who belongs to President Nicolas Maduro's Socialist Party. 
The Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment for additional information.
United States Geological Survey geophysicist Jessica Turner said the quake's depth, 76.5 miles (123 km) below the surface, would have dampened some of the shaking.
""A 7.3 magnitude quake is going to cause some damage, particularly as in this area, structures are vulnerable. The earth is able to absorb some of the energy, but a 7.3 quake produces a lot of energy,"" she said by telephone.
BOGOTA, TRINIDAD HIT
The quake was felt in capital Caracas, neighboring Colombia and nearby island nations like Trinidad and Tobago, and St. Lucia, to the west and north. 
In Trinidad and Tobago, there were initial reports of some cracks to buildings, cars damaged when concrete debris fell on them, and loss of electricity. 
Colombia's government said there were no reports of victims or damage but workers dashed out of high-rise blocks in capital Bogota. 
""It was a moment of panic, we thought the worst,"" said Jimena Valencia, a 29-year-old administrator in the north of Bogota.

The U.S. Pacific Tsunami Center canceled an earlier warning of a possible tsunami along the coast near the epicenter, some 190 kilometers (118 miles) from Cumana.

Williams, who returned to competition in March after giving birth last September, earned $62,000 in winnings over the past year but received $18.1 million from an endorsement portfolio unmatched among women in sports, Forbes said.
Williams, who will try to equal Margaret Court's record of 24 grand slam titles when she competes at the Aug. 27-Sept. 9 U.S. Open in New York, earned twice as much off the court as any other female athlete, according to Forbes.
Dane Caroline Wozniacki, who captured her maiden grand slam title at this year's Australian Open, was second on the list with combined earnings of ($13 million) while reigning U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens ($11.2 million) was third.
Spaniard Garbine Muguruza ($11 million) and Russian Maria Sharapova ($10.5 million) rounded out the top five.
Indian badminton player P.V. Sindhu ($8.5 million) and retired race car driver Danica Patrick ($7.5 million) were the only non-tennis players to crack the top 10, filling up the seventh and ninth spots, respectively.

Richard Preston, 53, who identified himself to media as the Imperial Wizard of the KKK white supremacist group, pleaded guilty in Charlottesville Circuit Court. According to media reports, Preston has argued he was acting in self defense. 
At the same ""Unite the Right"" rally, a man drove a car into a group of demonstrators protesting against white nationalists, killing a woman. James Alex Fields faces murder and hate crime charges in forthcoming trials in that incident.

Among the detainees is Israa al-Ghomgham, whom Saudi activists said was the first woman to possibly face the death penalty for rights-related work. Charges against her include incitement to protest and providing moral support to rioters.
""Any execution is appalling, but seeking the death penalty for activists like Israa al-Ghomgham, who are not even accused of violent behavior, is monstrous,"" Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at HRW, said in a statement on Wednesday.
ALQST, a London-based Saudi rights group, reported the decision involving Ghomgham's case earlier this week.
A government communications office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Activists said the trial was ongoing, and denied social media reports that the detainees had already been executed.
Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy where public protests and political parties are banned, has enacted some high-profile social and economic reforms in recent years under powerful young Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. 
They have, however, been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent, with dozens of clerics, intellectuals and activists arrested in the past year, including women who had campaigned for the right to drive in the deeply conservative Muslim country.
A roundup of senior royals, ministers and businessmen last November on charges of corruption sent shockwaves through the kingdom, stunning allies and foreign investors. Most of those detainees were released after reaching undisclosed financial settlements with the government.
Ghomgham is a prominent Shi'ite Muslim activist who documented mass demonstrations in the Eastern Province starting in 2011. She was arrested from her home in December 2015 along with her husband.
Most of the country’s Shi’ite minority lives in the oil-producing Eastern Province and some have complained that their religious ceremonies are banned or interfered with by Sunni authorities, and that they lack opportunities for work and education. The government has denied the charges.
Saudi Arabia has previously executed Shi'ite activists on what rights groups called politically-motivated charges. It views protests among Shi'ites in the context of tensions with Shi’ite power and regional rival Iran, which it has accused of fomenting the unrest.
The authorities have carried out security operations against suspected Shi'ite militants in the Eastern Province, which has seen unrest and occasional armed attacks for years.

925,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2018 07:51PM ET</span>",Ex Argentine leader Fernandez to allow searches of her properties,"By Hugh Bronstein and Walter Bianchi
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Former Argentine President Cristina Fernandez agreed on Tuesday to allow investigators to search properties belonging to her as part of a corruption case in which construction company executives have said they paid bribes for government contracts.
The scandal is of importance to next year's presidential election, in which leftist Fernandez may try to unseat Argentina's current leader, Mauricio Macri, whose popularity has fallen as the economy slips into recession and inflation soars.
The scandal exploded this month when a local newspaper revealed that a chauffeur employed by the Fernandez administration said he kept records of cash deliveries from construction executives to government officials from 2005 to 2015. Fernandez denies wrongdoing and has immunity as a senator.
""I have no problem with the Senate authorizing what has been asked for by (judge Claudio) Bonadio,"" Fernandez tweeted, referring to the judge in charge of the case, who has requested her three homes be searched for evidence.
""But I want to make clear that my decision should in no way validate the irrational measures taken by Bonadio in his prosecutorial crusade against me,"" she tweeted.
Critics of Fernandez on Tuesday called on the Senate to remove her immunity and for her to be prosecuted. Her second term ended in 2015 when she was succeeded by Macri, whose orthodox policies are at odds with her efforts at increasing government control of the economy.
More than a dozen executives and officials from Fernandez's administration have been arrested. Fernandez says she is being persecuted by Macri, and accuses him of using the scandal to distract media attention from an economy hobbled by inflation running at more than 31 percent annually. 
The Senate is set to vote Wednesday on whether to allow Fernandez's properties to be searched. 
Credit ratings agencies Moody's and Fitch have warned that the scandal could prove damaging to Argentina's creditworthiness and economy. Weighed down in part by a sell-off in emerging markets world-wide, Argentina's peso currency has weakened 8.6 percent this month to 30 per U.S. dollar.

His trip comes after polls suggested Labour support in Scotland has been slipping since its encouraging performance in last year's UK-wide election.
Corbyn, who has steered Labour to the left, is calling for Britain to roll back its ""dangerous and failed"" policy of contracting private firms like Serco,  G4S  (CO:G4S) and Capita to deliver and manage public services in healthcare, transport and detention centers.
The row over immigrants blew up after Serco announced a plan to change the locks on the homes of asylum seekers whose applications had been refused.
Following protests and campaigns by refugee charities, the Scottish National Party (SNP) and Labour, Serco announced a ""pause"" in the plan earlier this month.
""Private firms have no business profiting from the detention of refugees and asylum seekers and we will end the ugly and discredited system of private firms running immigration detention centers,"" Corbyn will say, according to a statement.
With Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservatives deeply divided and struggling to deliver Brexit in time for a March 2019 deadline, there are few points to separate the leading parties in opinion polls. 
On Monday, the British government announced it had taken over the running of a major prison in England from G4S after it had become unmanageable, the latest in a string of failed private sector projects to run public services.
""Labour will end this shameful situation and close Yarl's Wood and Brook House detention centers, investing the money spent on locking people up on services that support survivors of modern slavery, human trafficking and domestic violence instead,"" Corbyn will say.
A spokesman for Serco declined to comment.
Yarl's Wood and Brook House in southern England are run by Serco and G4S respectively, where immigrants and asylum seekers are detained. Brook House, at Gatwick airport was at the center of an abuse scandal earlier this year.

Labour policies like nationalizing the rail and water industries helped the party deny the pro-privatization Conservatives a majority government in the 2017 election.

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - El Salvador said on Tuesday it hoped its economy would get a lift from China after it broke diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favor of Beijing, reducing the dwindling group of allies the Asian island has in Latin America.
El Salvador was the third Latin American country in the past two years to switch alliances, and presidential spokesman Roberto Lorenzana said attracting investment and developing the economy were key goals behind the decision.
""Fundamentally, it's an interest in betting on the growth of our country with one of the world's most booming economies,"" he said in a television interview following Monday's announcement. ""El Salvador can't turn its back on international reality.""
Monday's move left Taiwan with only 17 allies, and came shortly after its president visited Belize and Paraguay, aiming to shore up diplomatic ties in the face of Chinese pressure to stamp out the island's international recognition.
The decision prompted an outcry from Taiwan, which has accused China of luring smaller countries to its side with offers of generous aid.
Taiwan's foreign minister has said that Taiwan will not engage in ""money competition,"" and did not give El Salvador funds for a port development after deeming the project ""unsuitable.""
It was unclear if China had offered any specific aid or economic incentive to El Salvador. 
Taiwan's formal relations are now mostly with small nations in Central America and the Pacific.
Panama ditched Taiwan for China in 2017, and Burkina Faso and the Dominican Republic followed early this year. 
The United States keeps unofficial relations with Taiwan, a source of tension with China, whose ""one China"" policy stipulates that Taiwan is part of the bigger nation.
U.S. relations with El Salvador have been strained over President Donald Trump's threats to cut aid from countries that ""do nothing"" to stop MS-13 gang members from crossing illegally into the United States. 
The U.S. ambassador in El Salvador, Jean Manes, said at an event on Tuesday that Salvadorans should demand transparency about how their government resolved to swap diplomatic partners.
""I think you should know, exactly, all the details of the negotiation,"" she said. 
Manes also posted on Twitter that the United States was analyzing the ""worrisome"" decision, and that it would impact relations between the two countries. She did not elaborate.
Salvadoran President Salvador Sanchez Ceren said in a televised address on Monday that a ""careful analysis"" including consultations with diverse sectors led to the decision.
Representatives were already in Beijing to establish ties, he said, and would immediately begin talks on trade, investment, infrastructure, science, health, education, tourism and support for small and medium-size companies. 

""They will generate tangible benefits for the whole population,"" Sanchez Ceren said.

The foreign ministry said it was inviting Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Chile, Mexico, Peru, Paraguay, Panama, Dominican Republic, Uruguay, and Venezuela to a Sept. 17-18 meeting in Quito.
The diplomatic activity comes amid a ballooning exodus that has inundated border towns and flooded some Latin American job markets with low-skilled Venezuelans desperate for work in order to send money back to their convulsed homeland.
With the International Monetary Fund forecasting that Venezuela's inflation could reach 1 million percent by the year's end, malnutrition is on the rise, as a monthly minimum wage that amounts to a few U.S. dollars puts basic products like chicken out of reach for many.
In the last week, both Ecuador and Peru have announced tighter entry requirements for Venezuelans, while in Brazil rioters drove hundreds of migrants back over the border. 
""It is the moment to exchange opinions, to see what different countries are doing in different aspects,"" said Ecuador's Vice Minister for Human Mobility Santiago Chavez in the statement. 

""The worst that can happen to the country (Ecuador) is migratory chaos,"" he added.

GREELEY, Colo. (Reuters) - A Colorado oil worker accused of murdering his pregnant wife and two young daughters showed little emotion on Tuesday when a judge read the charges at a hearing punctuated by sobs from the man's father-in-law.
Chris Watts, 33, barely spoke and did not formally enter a plea to the charges at a hearing in Greeley, about 60 miles (100 km) north of Denver. 
His appearance in Weld County Court came one day after authorities released what they said was a confession by Watts. In their account, Watts said he killed his wife because she had strangled their two daughters after an argument. 
Watt's public defenders declined to comment. 
The case began in the nearby community of Frederick last week when Watts' wife, Shanann, and their two daughters, ages 3 and 4, were reported missing in the former mining town. Watts had pleaded for their return in interviews with Denver television stations on Aug. 14, the day they were reported missing.
Police arrested Watts the following day and on Monday he was formally charged with multiple counts of first-degree murder, one count of unlawful termination of a pregnancy and three counts of tampering with a deceased human body. 
Watts, who was wearing glasses and an orange jail uniform, quietly responded with ""yes"" or ""yes, sir"" each time the judge read a charge against him.
Shanann Watts' father, Frank Rzucek, sat hunched over and sobbing in court as his son put his arm around him. 
Rzucek spoke briefly to reporters on Monday, choking back tears and thanking people for supporting his family. ""Keep the prayers coming,"" he said.
Watts has been ordered jailed without bond and faces the possibility of life in prison or the death penalty if convicted of murder.
Watts told investigators he was having an affair and announced to his wife he wanted a separation, according to an arrest affidavit made public on Monday.
Shanann Watts, after hearing her husband wanted to leave her, killed the couple's two daughters, Chris Watts told police, according to the affidavit. Watts said he saw his wife on a baby monitor as she throttled one of the girls and that he went into a rage and strangled Shanann.
Prosecutors, in charging Watts with murder in the deaths of all three family members, have discounted his claim that his wife slayed their daughters, Celeste and Bella.

Shanann's body was discovered in a shallow grave and the couple's daughters had been stuffed into tanks at the oil field north of Denver where Watts worked, prosecutors said.

ALLENTOWN, Pa. (Reuters) - A Catholic priest who prosecutors said groped a 17-year-old girl from his Allentown, Pennsylvania, parish was arrested on Tuesday and charged with assault and corruption of a minor, authorities said.
Father Kevin Lonergan, 30, was also accused of sending naked pictures of himself to the girl, identified only as ""Jane Doe,"" after obtaining her cell phone number from another member of his congregation, Lehigh County District Attorney Jim Martin said at a press conference. 
""Many of the communications were sexual in nature, and he sent her nude images of himself over Snapchat,"" Martin said of Lonergan, who lives with his parents in Pottsville, Pennsylvania.
Lonergan was charged with one count each of corrupting a minor and indecent assault, Martin said, and faces up to nine years in prison if convicted at trial.
It was not immediately clear if Lonergan had retained a criminal defense attorney. A telephone number obtained for Lonergan by Reuters did not appear to be working on Tuesday.
He was taken into custody one week after Pennsylvania's attorney general released a nearly 900-page grand jury report about sexual abuse by some 300 Catholic priests in Pennsylvania based on documents from secret archives kept by the archdiocese. 
Lonergan's arrest, stemming from incidents in December 2017 and January 2018, was unrelated to the grand jury report, Martin said.
The attorney general said the report, which followed a two-year investigation, was the most comprehensive report on Catholic clergy sex abuse in American history, nearly two decades after an expose of widespread abuse and cover-up in Boston rocked the Roman Catholic church. 
The girl reported the contact to priests at Central Catholic High School in Allentown, Martin said. The Allentown Diocese removed Lonergan from his duties after prosecutors alerted them to the case, he said. 
“The diocese cooperated fully with the law enforcement investigation,” the Allentown Diocese said in a statement on Tuesday.

JAMARAT, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - More than 2 million Muslim pilgrims hurled pebbles at a giant wall in a symbolic stoning of the devil on Tuesday, the riskiest stage of the annual haj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia where hundreds died in a crush three years ago.
Clad in white robes signifying a state of purity, men and women from 165 countries converged on Jamarat to perform the ritual from a three-storey bridge erected to ease congestion after earlier stampedes.
Under close supervision from Saudi authorities, the faithful carried umbrellas to block the blazing sun, with daytime temperatures topping 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).
They will return to the bridge over the next two days for more stoning before returning to Mecca to pray at the Grand Mosque at the end of haj.
For a graphic on The haj journey http://tmsnrt.rs/2imJ2yf
The kingdom stakes its reputation on its guardianship of Islam's holiest sites - Mecca and Medina - and organizing the world's largest annual Muslim gathering, which retraces the route Prophet Mohammad took 14 centuries ago. 
It has deployed more than 130,000 security forces and medics as well as modern technology including surveillance drones to maintain order. 
""The police assistance and the services were all extraordinary. Praise God, I am very happy and God willing our Lord will provide for us again,"" said Jordanian Firas al-Khashani, 33.
The authorities redesigned the Jamarat area after stampedes in 2004 and 2006 killed hundreds of pilgrims, and the frequency of such disasters has greatly reduced as the government spent billions of dollars upgrading and expanding haj infrastructure and crowd control technology.
But with so many participants, panic is a constant danger.
The 2015 crush killed nearly 800 people, according to Riyadh, when two large groups of pilgrims arrived together at a crossroads on a road leading to the stoning site.
Counts by countries of repatriated bodies, however, showed more than 2,000 people may have died, more than 400 of them from Iran, which boycotted haj the following year. It was the worst disaster in at least a quarter century.
Saudi authorities said at the time that the crush may have been caused by pilgrims failing to follow crowd control rules, and King Salman ordered an investigation but the results were never announced.
Some 86,000 Iranians are attending this year amid a diplomatic rift between Tehran and Riyadh, which are locked in a struggle for regional supremacy. Their dispute was exacerbated by the 2015 crush.
An Interior Ministry spokesman said the pilgrims this year were adhering to a strict timetable in order to reduce congestion. The Health Ministry reported no outbreak of disease so far, a perennial concern.
""A BEAUTIFUL FEELING""
More than 2.37 million pilgrims, most of them from abroad, have arrived for the five-day ritual, a religious duty once in a lifetime for every able-bodied Muslim who can afford the journey.
""It is a beautiful feeling,"" said Egyptian Hazem Darweesk, 31. ""The beauty of it is in the difficulty of performing it. It brings you closer to God.""
King Salman and his son Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman received well-wishers on Tuesday at a palace gathering attended by royals, clerics, military leaders and distinguished guests, marking the first day of Eid al-Adha, or the feast of sacrifice.
""Our country's greatest honor is to serve God's guests,"" the 82-year-old monarch tweeted. ""On Eid al-Adha, I ask God to complete the pilgrims' haj and to perpetuate the goodness and peace for our nation and all other countries.""
Saudi authorities have urged pilgrims to set aside politics during the haj but violence in the Middle East, including wars in Syria, Yemen and Libya - and other global hotspots - remain on the minds of many.
Some worshippers criticized Arab leaders for failing to block President Donald Trump's decision to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem after he recognized the city as Israel's capital.
Pilgrimage is also the backbone of a Saudi plan to expand tourism under a drive to diversify the economy away from oil. The haj and year-round umrah generate billions of dollars in revenue from worshippers' lodging, transport, fees and gifts.
The authorities aim to increase the number of umrah and haj pilgrims to 15 million and 5 million respectively by 2020, and hope to double the umrah number again to 30 million by 2030.
Pakistani Fayas Shahid, 30, said he felt relieved after nearing the end of the exacting journey: ""May Allah accept my haj and give everybody a chance to everybody to perform haj.""

A statement by Israel's Health Ministry said the Juul device was banned because it contains nicotine at a concentration higher than 20 milligrams per milliliter and poses ""a grave risk to public health"". 
Since launching in 2015, the flash drive-sized vaping device has transformed the market in the United States, where it now accounts for nearly 70 percent of tracked e-cigarette sales. 
In a statement Tuesday, Juul Labs Inc said it was “incredibly disappointed” with what it called a “misguided” decision by the government in Israel. The San Francisco company said it planned to appeal the ban, adding that its devices provide smokers “a true alternative to combustible cigarettes.” 
The Israeli move was consistent with similar restrictions in Europe, the ministry's statement said.
The ban, which goes into effect in 15 days, was signed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who also holds the health portfolio. 
Israel's Haaretz newspaper reported in May that Juul e-cigarettes were already available for purchase at 30 locations around the country. 
Juul says it targets adult smokers, but it has faced scrutiny over the popularity of its products with teenagers. 

In April the U.S. Food and Drug Administration launched a crackdown on the sale of e-cigarettes and tobacco products to minors, particularly those developed by Juul Labs.

CARACAS/VALENCIA, Venezuela (Reuters) - Venezuela's streets were quieter than normal on Tuesday, as a currency devaluation and package of economic measures by socialist President Nicolas Maduro went into effect, and the opposition asked storekeepers to shut up shop in protest.
The OPEC nation on Monday cut five zeros from prices and pegged the country's currency to an obscure state-backed cryptocurrency, as part of a broad set of measures meant to address hyperinflation and an economic crisis.
The central bank reported a new exchange rate of 68 bolivars per euro, in line with the 60-bolivar-per-dollar rate that Maduro implied when he announced the new measures on Friday. 
That would represent a devaluation of 96 percent from the previous official rate. But the impact of that is limited by the fact that most individuals and businesses were already relying on the black market for hard currency, where dollars currently fetch around 93 bolivars. 
Critics slammed the plan as inadequate in the face of inflation that topped 82,000 percent in July and called for a one-day halt of commercial activities.
Many shops closed in downtown Caracas, and opposition politician Andres Velasquez estimated that 60 percent of the population had joined the national strike.
In those stores that opened, items that cost 1,000,000 bolivars last week were remarked with price tags of 10 bolivars. 
""All of us have lost (with these measures), and we are falling into an abyss,"" Velasquez said at a news conference. ""If we don't stand firm against the regime, we're going to have this regime forever, which is their plan."" 
The Information Ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
A small group of government supporters marched toward the presidential palace in downtown Caracas to support Maduro's economic measures.
""I hope they enforce these measures and that the businesses that don't agree with them are shut down,"" said Julio Contreras, 70, an employee of the Caracas municipal government. ""We have to take on the businessmen.""
In what could signal such a new wave of confrontation, government officials occupied a local unit of paper packaging company  Smurfit Kappa  (I:SKG), according to a union leader and a tweet by state price-control agency Sundde.
The occupation was the result of worker complaints over a July decision to give them paid vacation rather than keep them on the job, the union said. Salaries in Venezuela are often so low that workers rely on factory cafeterias to get enough to eat.
""This is a temporary takeover for three months, while there is an investigation into what's happening at the plant,"" union leader Rafael Rangel said by telephone from the plant in the central city of Valencia.
Smurfit Kappa's Investor Relations division did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
FEW WORKERS, FEW PRODUCTS
Fedecamaras, the country's main business group, slammed Maduro's economic package as incoherent, and said that a significant minimum wage increase that is part of the plan would make it impossible for businesses to keep their doors open.
At major produce market Quinta Crespo, some stands were closed. Some employees were unable to get to work because they could not find public transportation, which has been in steady decline for months due to lack of auto parts.
""My employees didn't arrive, and the suppliers didn't offer much because there is a lot of uncertainty about salaries and prices,"" said Jesus Rojas, 36, who runs a fruit stand at the market. 
Businesses were largely closed in the second-largest city, Maracaibo, which has suffered months of prolonged power outages, as well as in the smaller cities of Punto Fijo and Valencia. Banks had long lines outside as people sought to withdraw the newly released bills.
The collapse of the country's once-booming economy has fueled hunger and disease, spurring an exodus of migrants to nearby countries. 

Maduro says his government is the victim of an ""economic war"" led by the opposition with the help of Washington, which last year levied several rounds of sanctions against his government and high-ranking officials.

TORONTO (Reuters) - A group of Canadian refugee lawyers is taking the government to court over a recent immigration ruling, calling it unfair to Nigerian asylum seekers who have streamed across the border from the United States in large numbers over the past 18 months.
The legal challenge from the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers was prompted by the decision to designate as precedent-setting a May ruling by Canada's Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) rejecting the asylum claim of a Nigerian woman who fled her homeland to escape the practice of female genital mutilation.
A tribunal in the IRB's appeals division ruled that the woman failed to qualify for asylum because she could have sought refuge in the large Nigerian cities of Ibadan or Port Harcourt, away from her rural family home.
Last month, in the wake of the appeal division ruling, the IRB said the woman's case should be used as a ""jurisprudential guide"" or legal precedent in considering all future Nigerian asylum cases.
The IRB has made similar decisions in cases involving migrants from China, India and Pakistan. 
The Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers said Nigerians would now likely face a higher bar to gain asylum status than they did in the past.
""It's very problematic,"" Lorne Waldman, an attorney with the association told Reuters. ""It enhances the evidentiary burden on claimants from Nigeria in a way that I say is unfair.""
Canada is struggling to cope with a wave of asylum seekers, with more than 30,000 having illegally walked across the Canada-U.S. border since January 2017, according to government figures. 
About 10,000 of those who crossed are Nigerian. Their acceptance rate as of June was about 33 percent, below the average of 47 percent for all those who crossed the border illegally, according to data from the IRB.
The Association of Refugee Lawyers filed a request for a judicial review of the new guideline in federal court in Toronto last month. If successful, it could seek a court order blocking the new evidentiary requirements for Nigerians, potentially covering Chinese, Indian and Pakistani asylum seekers as well.
An IRB spokeswoman said in an email that the purpose of the Nigeria guideline was to ensure ""consistency and efficiency in decision-making"" about refugee claims from what she described as a ""major source country.""
It has already cost some claimants their chance at refugee status, according to lawyers. 
Last week, an IRB tribunal member ruled against granting asylum to a Nigerian man and his family on grounds that there were safe places for them to live in Nigeria, said his lawyer Anne Castagner. 
The man, who asked to be identified only as Samson out of fear for his family's safety, said he was a prominent property developer in Nigeria when he began to be targeted by what he suspects were rival developers. 
He and his family were attacked repeatedly, according to his asylum claim. They moved to another city but were pursued by the same people, he said, so they fled to the United States and then on across the border into Canada.
There was no safe flight alternative in Nigeria, he said. 
""I can't imagine having to go back to a country where our lives are not safe ... They should send me back, but not the kids.""
Castagner is preparing to appeal Samson's case but said she worries about upcoming cases.

""I don't think the real refugees should suffer from the fact that we have a lot of Nigerians coming in,"" she said.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - A Ugandan lawmaker whose arrest sparked two days of anti-government demonstrations has been left unable to stand after being beaten while in detention, his lawyer said on Tuesday, citing relatives who visited him.
The Ugandan government denied the assault accusation as ""rubbish"" and said the London-based lawyer should visit the detention facility to see for himself.
The arrest last week of Robert Kyagulanyi, a musician-turned-lawmaker who goes by the stage name Bobi Wine, and four other lawmakers critical of President Yoweri Museveni triggered protests in the capital Kampala and other parts of the country.
They were arrested on Aug. 13 on suspicion of involvement in the stoning of a presidential convoy during a parliamentary by-election campaign. Kyagulanyi was charged on Aug. 16 with unlawful possession of weapons and ammunition while three other lawmakers and dozens of other people also detained in relation to the stoning incident were charged with treason. He remains in a military facility in Kampala.
""We believe the ribs on the right side are crushed. He was beaten with a metal bar,"" Robert Amsterdam, one of Kyagulanyi's attorneys told Reuters, citing reports relayed to him from relatives who had visited Kyagulanyi. ""He's unable to stand.""
Government spokesman Ofwono Opondo dismissed the comments.
""That's rubbish,"" Opondo said. ""If (Amsterdam) is indeed Bobi Wine's lawyer, let him go to the detention facility and apply to see him and establish for himself whether his ribs are crushed.""
A spokesman for Amsterdam said he had not yet been able to travel to Kampala but that a member of his law firm had arrived and that he was in touch with the Kyagulanyi and the local legal team ""on an hourly basis"". The spokesman said direct access to Kyagulanyi had been ""severely restricted"". 
Kyagulanyi, whose songs are stingingly critical of Museveni's government, has a large youth following. He entered parliament last year.
Protesters and opposition supporters accuse Museveni, in power since 1986, of stifling dissent through intimidation, beatings and detentions, charges which his government denies.
On Monday, police in Kampala fired tear gas and military units were deployed to disperse demonstrators who set up bonfires and barricades in a second day of protests. 
Police said they had detained 68 people during two days of disturbances. Among them was a Reuters photographer, who has since been released from police detention. Footage broadcast by local station NTV showed people being struck with clubs and canes by men in uniform during the unrest.
On Tuesday, the army condemned what it said was the ""unprofessional conduct"" of soldiers who beat journalists covering the demonstration. It said in a statement that the head of the military had ordered the arrest and punishment of the soldiers responsible.
""Reuters condemns in the strongest possible terms the physical violence used against our photographer,"" Reuters said in a statement. It said it would evaluate how to address the situation with local authorities in the coming days.

The U.S. Treasury said in a statement that the sanctioned companies, Saint Petersburg-based Vela-Marine Ltd and Slovakia-based Lacno S.R.O., and the two individuals helped Divetechnoservices evade previously imposed sanctions.
In June, the United States sanctioned Divetechnoservices, also based in Saint Petersburg, for procuring underwater equipment and diving systems for Russian government agencies, including Russia's FSB intelligence agency.
The Obama administration sanctioned the FSB in December 2016, citing the Russian government's aggressive harassment of U.S. officials and cyber operations aimed at the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
In a statement on the Russian foreign ministry's website, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov called the latest sanctions groundless and promised a response from Moscow.
Ryabkov's criticism extended to separate sanctions Washington imposed on Tuesday on two Russian shipping companies that it said were involved in transferring refined petroleum products to North Korean vessels in violation of Unite Nations restrictions.
The U.S. Treasury said the two individuals targeted on Tuesday under the cyber-related sanctions program, Marina Igorevna Tsareva and Anton Aleksandrovich Nagibin, had both helped Divetechnoservices attempt to circumvent U.S. sanctions.
The head of Vela-Marine told Reuters he did not understand why his company was being designated. Speaking by telephone, Andrei Kuklin, head of the company, said, ""Unfortunately I cannot comment. I don't understand what the problem is.""
Reuters was unable to immediately determine contact information for Lacno, which does not have its own website and which does not list any contact number on the Slovak finance ministry registry of firms website.

Nagibin did not answer a call seeking comment. Reuters was not immediately able to identify contact information for Tsareva.

NELLIYAMPATHY/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's flood-ravaged Kerala state will seek to borrow more than 100 billion rupees ($1.4 billion) to finance reconstruction work after a disaster that has claimed nearly 400 lives, its chief minister said on Tuesday.
The proposed loan is part of a special package that the southern state, which estimates it has suffered damage of at least 200 billion rupees, will seek from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government for rebuilding efforts, minister Pinarayi Vijayan said.
Kerala will ask Modi's government to raise the state's borrowing ceiling to 4.5 percent of its GDP from 3 percent, which will help raise an additional 105 billion rupees from the market, Vijayan said.
""Our aim is not merely a restoration of the state to pre-flood times, but the creation of a new Kerala,"" Vijayan told reporters.
The worst floods in the state in a century claimed 383 lives, razed tens of thousands of homes, and washed away roads and bridges. Around 1.3 million are sheltering in thousands of relief camps.
Even as rescue efforts come to a halt across Kerala and focus shifts to relief, more than 3,000 people in a remote village located in an eco-sensitive area are angry with what they say is the apathy of forest officials in rescue and relief operations.
Villagers in Nelliyampathy, a remote hill station that has been isolated from the nearest town after its only road suffered heavy damage due to flooding and landslides, allege officials are restricting aid efforts by blocking locals and outsiders from bringing in food supplies.
Government engineers said the temporary restoration of road access will take another four days and that food supplies won't be airlifted any more, instead being transported by volunteers and government staff.
Roads were found to be impassable and huge trees had fallen over them. Diesel and food supplies have to be carried to reach the point at which the road is accessible.

SUFFICIENT FOOD 
""There is no way to communicate with the rest of the state as none of the mobile networks are working, bank and government officials have not turned up, and even our own people are being stopped from carrying food,"" said K Girija, vice-president of the village administration, adding that multiple representations to the government had gone unanswered.
Asked why the forest department is restricting aid efforts, the district's top most administrative officer declined to comment.
""A system would be put in place to ensure sufficient food supplies and provide other amenities,"" D. Balamurali told Nelliyampathy villagers, as three helicopters descended to supply food. Helicopters were used to transport pregnant women and cancer patients on Tuesday.
However, the villagers say the aid was coming too late as the road had become inaccessible six days ago and villagers had found it difficult to communicate problems relating to restricted movement and damaged property.
The federal government has classified the floods as a ""calamity of severe nature,"" and has committed 6 billion rupees in interim relief so far. Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said the government will provide as much help as possible.
Authorities are handing out medicines and disinfectants to ward off diseases as a huge clean-up gathers pace.
The federal government has sent tonnes of emergency drugs and bleaching powder, besides supplying tablets for water purification, though J.P. Nadda, federal health minister, said no outbreak of communicable disease had been reported yet. 
The United Arab Emirates said it will provide 7 billion rupees to the state. ""Kerala has a special relationship with the UAE, which is a home away from home for Malayalees,"" Vijayan said.
Several Gulf countries have a sizeable population of Keralites as expatriate workers. Since the 1960s, remittances from the Gulf have been the backbone of Kerala's economy, making up a third of its gross domestic product.
India said on Tuesday it plans to set up a cyclone warning center in Kerala's capital Thiruvananthapuram in a month's time, as several tropical cyclones and severe weather events have recently struck the state and neighboring Karnataka coasts.

""There was a violation to Colombia's sovereignty on the part of two military helicopters, identified with the acronym of the Bolivarian National Guard, and some 30 armed soldiers,"" Colombia's foreign ministry said in a statement.
The ministry sent a letter to the Venezuelan embassy in Bogota expressing its ""most energetic protest"" against the incident, which took place in the Tibu municipality in Norte de Santander (MC:SAN) province on Sunday, the statement added.
The Venezuelan government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Venezuelan soldiers have repeatedly crossed into Colombia without permission, exacerbating long-standing tensions between the neighbors. Colombia is a top destination for Venezuelans fleeing food and medicine shortages amidst their country's deep economic crisis.

940,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2018 01:50PM ET</span>",Some U.S. officials confident feared al Qaeda bomb maker killed,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is confident the top al Qaeda bomb maker, believed to be the mastermind behind a failed bombing of a U.S.-bound airliner in 2009, has been killed, two U.S. officials said even as others cautioned the evidence was not conclusive.
Washington has long sought Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, a militant with al Qaeda's Yemen branch who is one of the world's most feared bomb makers because of his ability to create hard-to-detect bombs, including some implanted in suicide bombers. 
Two U.S. officials, including a senior official, said they were confident al-Asiri had been killed. They were speaking on the condition of anonymity.
""We are pretty confident that he has been killed,"" one of the officials said. 
That official added, however, that the usual fallout from a senior militant being killed, like a eulogy from Yemen's al Qaeda branch, known as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), had not appeared. Separate U.S. intelligence officials said they do not consider the available evidence conclusive.
A report by U.N. experts monitoring Islamic State and al Qaeda for the U.N. Security Council, which was made public last week, said some states had reported that al-Asiri ""may have been killed during the second half of 2017."" 
""Given al-Asiri's past role in plots against aviation, this would represent a serious blow to operational capability,"" the U.N. experts wrote. 
U.S. officials cautioned that while his death would be a major symbolic blow to AQAP, al-Asiri's bomb-making skills almost certainly have been passed to others, and the threat from the group does not appear to have been significantly reduced. 
The U.S. military and CIA have carried out strikes in Yemen. Neither commented on reports that al-Asiri had been killed. 
AQAP has taken advantage of Yemen's civil war to strengthen its position in the impoverished Arab state. The militant group still operates in several provinces in south and eastern Yemen.
Intelligence analysts believe that AQAP is one of the groups most capable of carrying out attacks against the United States.
Al-Asiri is believed to have masterminded the attempted Christmas Day, 2009, bombing of a U.S.-bound passenger jet. A Nigerian man is serving multiple life sentences in prison for trying to set off the bomb in his underwear.
The United States added al-Asiri to its terrorism blacklist in 2011 after he was believed to be the key suspect in the 2010 al Qaeda parcel bomb plot against the United States.

Al-Asiri was born in 1982 in Saudi Arabia to a military family and has been accused of recruiting his younger brother as a suicide bomber for a failed attack on former Saudi counter-terrorism chief Prince Mohammed bin Nayef in 2009.

The New York Times reported on Sunday that Bennett had accused Argento of sexually assaulting him in 2013 when he was 17 and she was 37. Argento agreed to pay him $380,000 after he asked for $3.5 million, the paper said.
""I am deeply shocked and hurt by having read news that is absolutely false. I have never had any sexual relationship with Bennett,"" Argento said in an emailed statement distributed by her Italian lawyer.
In her first public comments since the article, Argento said she had been linked to Bennett over several years ""by friendship only"".
Representatives for Bennett did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the matter.
A spokesperson for The New York Times told Reuters: ""We are confident in the accuracy of our reporting, which was based on verified documents and multiple sources.""
Argento said in her statement that Bennett had ""unexpectedly made an exorbitant request of money"" to her following her media exposure in the accusations of sexual misconduct against movie producer Harvey Weinstein.
Argento was one of the first women to publicly accuse Weinstein. She told The New Yorker magazine last October that he had raped her during the Cannes festival in 1997 when she was 21. Since that interview, she has become an outspoken advocate in the #MeToo social media movement against sexual harassment.
She said in her statement that she and her then-boyfriend, the culinary television star Anthony Bourdain, had ""decided to deal compassionately with Bennett's demand for help and give it to him"".
""Anthony personally undertook to help Bennett economically, upon the condition that we would no longer suffer any further intrusions in our life,"" she added.  
Bourdain killed himself in June.

Argento said she would oppose the ""false allegations"" against her and would assume ""all necessary initiatives for my protection before all competent venues"".

942,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2018 12:34PM ET</span>",Ex-Comoros president charged with graft in connection to passports scheme,"MORONI (Reuters) - Comoros ex-president Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed Sambi has been formally charged with corruption and embezzling public funds in connection with a scheme to sell his country's passports, the prosecutor and court documents said.
Sambi, who had previously been questioned and placed under house arrest, will also be officially detained to prevent him from fleeing the country or undermining investigations by communicating with others accused of involvement in the scheme.
A lawyer for Sambi said he was being held in ""prison-like"" conditions. The ex-president, who was in power from 2006-2011, has previously denied all allegations against him.
The Comoros Islands, an Indian Ocean nation of about 800,000 people, began its program to sell passports in 2008 as a way of raising much-needed cash.
The islands arranged a deal with the governments of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Kuwait, who wanted to provide stateless inhabitants there known as the Bidoon with identity documents, but not local citizenship. The governments would buy the Comoros passports and then distribute them to the Bidoon.
However, an investigation by the Comoros parliament released earlier this year found that thousands of passports had been sold outside official channels via ""mafia"" networks and at least $100 million of revenues had gone missing.
A Reuters investigation in June found that some of these passports had ended up being bought by Iranians, many of whom were involved in sectors that had been targeted by international sanctions in Iran.
A court document, dated Aug. 20 and seen by Reuters, showed Sambi and his associates also face charges linked to forgery and falsification of records. 
The court document said Sambi had abused his relative freedom in order to contact others who were involved in the scheme and still free to pressure them to hide evidence in order to undermine the investigation.
Another ex-president, Ikililou Dhoinine, who succeeded Sambi, and 10 other senior officials from their administrations have been banned from traveling but charges have not been brought against them.
Neither the document nor the prosecutor gave details on when any trial might take place.
Mahamoud Ahamada, one of Sambi’s lawyers, confirmed that Sambi had been charged and restrictions on him had been tightened, even though he was still sleeping in his own home.
""Sambi no longer has access to his telephone and the conditions of his detention are prison-like,"" he said. ""It seems he has been detained and charged in relation to the (passport) issue.""
Sambi's lawyers had challenged his house arrest and argued that the move was an attack on democracy in Comoros.
Current President Azali Assoumani has just won a referendum that will extend presidential term limits and end the system of rotating power between the archipelago's three main islands.

943,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2018 12:15PM ET</span>",Swiss government urges voters to reject more state help for farmers,"By John Revill
ZURICH (Reuters) - The Swiss government urged voters on Tuesday to reject more help for farmers and other proposals for agriculture in a referendum next month, saying they would send food prices rocketing and hurt the economy.
Switzerland will two hold referendums on Sept. 23 - one on giving more state support to farmers and another on introducing more sustainable and animal-friendly agricultural practices.
An early poll has shown widespread support for both ideas, but Economy Minister Johann Schneider-Ammann said the ""dangerous"" proposals could trigger tariff increases and other reprisals from trading partners.
One of the proposals, called the Fair Food initiative, wants all food in Switzerland to come from sustainable sources and make labeling more exact. It wants to improve animal welfare by banning imports of factory-farmed products and ensure food imports meet higher Swiss standards. 
Supporters like the Green Party and Social Democrats argue that consumers, animals, the environment and farmers would all benefit.
The other proposal wants to increase state aid to Swiss farmers, whose numbers have halved since 1985 and three farming businesses close every day.
""At first glance these proposals have stirred the sympathy of many citizens,"" Schneider-Ammann told a news conference.
""I am convinced that upon closer examination of the proposals citizens will see they will make food more expensive, reduce choice and lead to more cross-border shopping from Switzerland.""
Agriculture's contribution to the Swiss economy has fallen from 2 percent in 1985 to under 1 percent.
Supporters of the Food Sovereignty initiative for increased state help for struggling farmers, including farming groups and NGOs, want more price transparency to give farmers more heft when negotiating with retailers and food processors.
They also want to increase the number of people working in agriculture and impose stronger regulations on imports which could be subject to higher tariffs or even bans if they do not meet Swiss standards.
The government said the demands would lead to higher subsidies or fixed prices, a claim campaigners reject.
""We don't want more money, we just want to improve the negotiating position of farmers,"" said campaign spokesman Rudi Berli. ""Many are going bankrupt because the prices they get for their products are less than the costs of production.""
RETALIATORY MEASURES
The referendums are being held after farming groups and environmentalists gathered more than 100,000 signatures needed to trigger a vote under Switzerland's system of direct democracy.
Three quarters of people polled back the proposals, according to a survey by GFS Bern, a market research company.
The government says the proposals would lead to large-scale state intervention, while banning imports could prompt other countries to launch retaliatory tariffs and sanctions.
""Increasing the number of people working in agriculture can be done only with additional intervention by the government, and would come with higher costs. The entrepreneurial freedom of farmers would be endangered and their dependence on the state would be enormously increased,"" Schneider-Ammann said.

KOCHI/CHENGANNUR (Reuters) - Divya G. clung to a floating banana plant, then used a rope to pull herself to safety through neck-deep water as floods inundated her home in southern India. After more than a day camped with her family on the upper floor of her neighbors two-storey house, they were spotted by a fishing boat and rescued.
""We saw a boat coming down our lane and all of us started screaming for help,"" said Divya, 32, from Chengannur, one of the areas hit hardest by flooding in Kerala state last week. ""The boatmen helped us into the boats and brought us to the relief camps."" 
The worst floods in a century in Kerala have killed hundreds of people, left dozens missing and about a million sheltering in temporary camps. Thousands of army, navy and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams were deployed in the rescue efforts.
More than a dozen rescue officials, flood victims and others who spoke to Reuters said the unsung heroes of the massive relief operation were fishermen and other local people with boats, who volunteered to help rescue tens of thousands of stranded people, often long before official rescue teams could arrive.
""They were in tears when we saved their lives. They treated us like God,"" said fisherman Stephen Pallithottam, one of hundreds of local boatmen who joined the rescue mission in the Chengannur area. ""They touched our feet and said they will never forget us in their lives.""
Mohamed Ansheed, whose family was rescued in Malappuram district, some 170 km (105 miles) from Kerala's financial hub Kochi, said he was deeply indebted to the fishermen.
Ansheed also witnessed one rescue in which a local fisherman went on all fours in knee-deep waters, offering his back for women to step on to climb into a rescue boat. Images taken at the scene went viral on social media.
""I will never forget that day. They helped a lot of people,"" said Ansheed, adding that while NDRF teams had to halt their own rescue missions at sundown for safety reasons, local fishermen worked into the night with headlamps and rudimentary tools.
Many survivors interviewed by Reuters at a Chengannur relief camp recounted harrowing tales of fast-rising floodwaters on the night of Aug. 15.
""It was as if water levels were rising by a foot every five minutes. Even standing on tables or chairs was pointless,"" said M. Sneha, 20, who was rescued by boatmen that night. 
""BIGGEST HEROES""
Kerala, which markets itself to tourists as ""God's Own Country"" and is famed for its scenic lagoons, lakes and canals, has a lengthy coastline and is home to thousands of fishermen and boat tour operators.
The role played by many of them in the rescue operation is now being lauded by both flood victims and politicians.
""The biggest heroes are fishermen, they came in 600 boats and rescued people,"" said India's Tourism Minister K.J. Alphons, who hails from the state.
Kerala's Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the state would honor boatmen who participated in the rescue effort, reimburse them, and repair boats damaged in the operation.
Shijin Jose Antony, a priest at a church in state capital Thiruvananthapuram, helped organize the deployment of 130 boats and some 500 fishermen in rescue operations in Pathanamthitta and Alappuzha districts.
""When the fishermen came forward to join the operation, we informed the government, which made arrangements to transport the boats and fishermen to areas where their help was required,"" he said.
Shiji Dency, a fisherman from Ernakulam district, joined the rescue operation at Aluva and, along with five fishermen from the area, helped rescue about 1,000 people over five days. 
Dency says there were no army, navy, or NDRF teams at the location when they arrived.
""We were helped by the local people who were familiar with the area,"" said Dency, adding they navigated narrow, flooded lanes with cars floating by to reach some victims. 

""We are the people in the lowest strata of society,"" he said. ""The people who were trapped in the flood were rich. We felt bad when they pleaded with folded hands to save their lives. It was a heart-rending scene.""

946,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2018 11:41AM ET</span>",Britain presses for more EU sanctions against Russia,"By William James
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain pressed the European Union on Tuesday to increase sanctions against Russia, saying it should stand ""shoulder to shoulder"" with the United States, which hit Moscow with new economic restrictions this month. 
Britain's foreign minister, Jeremy Hunt, said that Russian President Vladimir Putin has made the world ""a more dangerous place"", and that after a chemical weapons attack in the English city of Salisbury, the EU should apply more pressure to ensure Russia sticks to international rules.
""Today the United Kingdom asks its allies to go further by calling on the European Union to ensure its sanctions against Russia are comprehensive, and that we truly stand shoulder to shoulder with the U.S.,"" Hunt told a Washington audience in his first major speech since his appointment in July. 
""That means calling out and responding to transgressions with one voice wherever and whenever they occur, from the streets of Salisbury to the heart of Crimea.""
Asked about Hunt's speech, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Britain had too high an opinion of itself and was trying to impose its Russia policy on the EU and the United States, the RIA news agency reported.
EU officials said Britain had not yet proposed any new sanctions on Russia to the other 27 EU member states.
Britain, the EU, and the United States blame Russia for a nerve agent attack against a Russian double agent in Salisbury earlier this year. The Kremlin denies involvement.
Citing the Salisbury incident, Washington has imposed sanctions against Moscow covering national-security related goods. It has promised more hard-hitting measures unless Russia gives ""reliable assurances"" it will no longer use chemical weapons.
The sanctions sparked a sell-off across Russian markets, and pushed up the country's cost of borrowing - with both likely to worsen if a second wave of measures is enacted. 
EU DIVIDED
Britain is preparing to leave the EU next March, but currently follows EU-level sanctions policy on Russia, agreed by all member states. The EU recently agreed to renew sanctions against Russia relating to its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and other activity in the region.
But the EU has not imposed further economic sanctions specifically linked to Salisbury, although it strongly condemned Moscow and joined international action to expel Russian officials after the attack. Its measures against Russia include finance restrictions and arms exports.
Any new EU sanctions would require unanimity among all 28 states. The current economic sanctions against Russia are in place until the end of January, 2019, as well as curbs on doing business with Crimea.
But while some countries such as Poland and the Baltic states back Britain's hawkish stance towards Russia, some other member states including Italy, Austria and Greece advocate more engagement with Moscow.
In Tuesday's speech Hunt also criticized China - like Russia a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council - over what he sees as its inaction over Crimea and chemical weapons.
On Brexit, where negotiations have become bogged down as the deadline for reaching an exit deal with the EU approaches, Hunt repeated his call for the bloc to show flexibility.
""Now is the time for the European Commission to engage with an open mind with the fair and constructive proposals made by the Prime Minister (Theresa May),"" he said.

Hunt, who took over from Boris Johnson as Britain's foreign minister in July, will meet U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other U.S. officials on Wednesday, and address the United Nations Security Council on Thursday.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's military said on Tuesday it would launch a criminal investigation into two incidents in which its troops shot dead Palestinian teenagers taking part in protests along the Gaza border.
The inquiry into the deaths of Abed Nabi, 18, on March 30, and 15-year-old Othman Helles on July 13 was the first announced by the military into its use of lethal force in the border demonstrations that began five months ago. 
At least 170 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers during the weekly protests, drawing international criticism of Israel. One Israeli soldier has been killed by a Gaza sniper.
Protests have included attempts to breach Israel's security fence along the frontier with the Islamist Hamas-run Gaza Strip.
There was no immediate comment by Palestinian officials in the occupied West Bank or in Gaza, where celebrations for the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha have begun. But Nabi's father, Bahjat, said the soldier who shot his son should stand trial.
""I ask for justice and to put the soldier who has wrongfully shot my son on trial. He was shot in the back. I ask for psychological and financial compensation for what we are going through,"" Bahjat Nabi said.
A statement from the Israeli military said its initial inquiries into the two events raised ""a suspicion that the shooting in these incidents was not in accordance with standard operating procedures"". 
Video posted on social media after the March 30 incident showed a Palestinian, identified by protest organizers as Abed Nabi, dropping to the ground as he ran, holding a tire. The organizers said he was shot with his back to Israeli forces.
The Gaza Health Ministry said that in the July 13 shooting, Helles was hit in the chest.
Israel has accused Hamas, regarded by the West as a terrorist group, of using the demonstrations as a cover for launching attacks. Hamas denies this. 
The protest campaign is pressing for an end to the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and for the right to return to land that Palestinians lost to Israel in the 1948 war of its foundation. More than half of Gaza's two million residents are war refugees and their descendants. 
Citing security concerns over Hamas and other armed groups in Gaza, Israel and Egypt maintain tight restrictions on their border crossings with the enclave, which have reduced its economy to a state of collapse. 

The United Nations and Egypt have been leading efforts to mediate a long-term ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, tackle humanitarian issues in Gaza and improve the economy of the small, coastal strip.

948,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>",'Punch to the face': Czechs mark half-century since Soviet invasion,"By Robert Muller
PRAGUE (Reuters) - Fifty years ago Soviet tanks rolled into Prague to crush the Czechoslovak Communist government's democratic reforms, ushering in a bloody occupation whose lessons many Czechs fear have been forgotten.
The anniversary, marked in Prague and the Slovak capital Bratislava by ceremonies, exhibitions and films about the 'Prague Spring' and its brutal suppression that began on Aug. 21, 1968, comes at a time of renewed influence for the long-marginalized Czech Communist Party in national politics.
Prominent European Union politicians said the anniversary also underlined the need to defend freedom and democracy today on a continent facing a new wave of authoritarianism in eastern Europe, as well as a more assertive Russia.
""August 21 (1968) was a punch to the face,"" said Vladimir Hanzel, recalling the raw violence of the day when 200,000 Warsaw Pact troops - mostly Soviet but also Polish, Hungarian and Bulgarian - descended on his country. 
Hanzel, then a 17-year-old student, said he made his way to the centre of Prague against his mother's advice to see the foreign troops blast the National Museum with heavy machine gunfire, mistaking the ornate building for a government office.
Amid general confusion, as the troops struggled with Czech street names, he described Prague citizens erecting barricades with trams and other vehicles, which prompted the soldiers to open fire, killing and wounding dozens.
Moscow's Communist leadership had ordered the invasion to end the Czechoslovak Communist Party's reforms easing travel restrictions and censorship. This had allowed greater media freedom and exposed the regime to allegations of corruption.
The surprise invasion led to the end of Czechoslovak Communist leader Alexander Dubcek's 'Socialism with a human face"" policy and to two more decades of totalitarian rule until mass peaceful protests in 1989 finally ended Communist rule.
COMMUNISTS ARE BACK
Hanzel, who later served as personal secretary to Vaclav Havel, the country's first post-communist president, expressed concern that, for the first time since 1989, the Czech Communists are again wielding political influence.
In July, the pro-Russian, anti-NATO Communists, who have maintained a place in parliament, helped Prime Minister Andrej Babis's minority government win a confidence vote.
""It is one of today's big paradoxes that... the Communists are again pushing forward and people don't mind,"" said Hanzel.
Babis told Reuters in an interview last month that today's Communists were a democratic party and no foreign partners had raised concerns.
Babis, a billionaire businessman, is battling in court allegations that he himself was an informer for the Communist secret police. He was greeted by protesters whistling and shouting ""Shame!"" at a ceremony to mark Tuesday's anniversary.
""I don't agree that freedom is under threat today,"" Babis said in a speech. ""Freedom and democracy mean above all that I am able to accept that somebody has the right to different opinions and preferences to mine.""
However, Petr Pithart, the first Czech prime minister after 1989 and then Senate speaker, said he expected protests against Babis over his cooperation with the Communists would continue.
""It is massive, as if people felt threatened again,"" he told Reuters.
Tuesday's anniversary coincides with mounting concerns in Brussels and other western European capitals about the resilience of democracy in post-communist member states. The EU and rights groups have criticised judicial reforms in Poland and Romania and the curbing of media freedoms in Hungary.
Alluding to such worries, veteran EU lawmaker Guy Verhofstadt tweeted: ""50 years ago today, the Red Army crushed the hopes of Czechs & Slovaks who sought freedom & democracy. Europeans must now stand together & reject a new wave of authoritarian influence undermining our societies again.""
Slovak President Andrej Kiska also tweeted: ""Our most important duty is to protect freedom & ability to determine our own future without a fear that choices we make will be crushed by brute force."" 
Another legacy of the Soviet-led invasion is deep distrust of Russia among many in both the Czech Republic and Slovakia - which split peacefully in 1993 - even though some leading politicians advocate increased economic ties.
Czech President Milos Zeman, who opposes EU sanctions on Moscow, drew criticism for declining to speak on Tuesday.
The Czech intelligence service often highlights Russian espionage activity in politics and business.

""(The Russians) probably would not come with tanks today but there are other forms. They think they are a great empire,"" said Dana Kyndrova, curator of an exhibition of photographs from August 21, 1968.

949,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2018 11:09AM ET</span>",Serbia may reintroduce compulsory military service: president,"BELGRADE (Reuters) - Serbia might reintroduce compulsory military service, nine years after abolishing it, to help improve the combat readiness of its army in the Balkans, where tensions occasionally flare, President Aleksandar Vucic said on Tuesday.
The armed forces of Serbia, which emerged as an independent state after the bloody collapse of former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, were fully professionalized in 2011, but remain poorly paid and equipped. 
Serbia, which is a candidate for European Union membership, has retained voluntary service and reserve units.
Vucic said Belgrade was considering reintroducing compulsory military service of between three and six months after 2020.
""We are still thinking about that ... It depends on the finances,"" he told reporters at the air force base of Batajnica, just outside Belgrade.
Young people who served would have an advantage when seeking jobs in the public sector, Vucic added, without elaborating. 
Serbian politicians have repeatedly floated the idea of reintroducing conscription. But many military experts say it would be too costly and that such a short period of service would contribute little to the country's defense capabilities. 
Under its 2018 budget, Serbia allocated $703 million, or 1.39 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) for its 40,000-strong military, up from $693.8 million in 2017. 
In recent years Serbia has sought to improve its defense capabilities through a donation of six MIG-29 fighters by Russia, with which it has strong historic and cultural ties, and through the purchase of 10 helicopters manufactured by Airbus. 
Vucic and Defence Minister Aleksandar Vulin have frequently spoken of procuring surplus tanks, attack helicopters and armored personnel carriers from Russia and more jet fighters from Belarus, but such deals have yet to materialize. 
In 2006 Serbia, which maintains military neutrality, joined NATO's Partnership for Peace program and in 2015 it signed the Individual Partnership Action Plan - the highest level of cooperation for countries not aspiring to join the alliance.

Although it strives for a balance between Moscow and the West, Serbia in 2017 took part in more than 100 joint activities with NATO or its member states, including 13 training drills, seven bilateral activities with the United States and only two with Russia.

""The continuation and further development of the DPRK's nuclear program and related statements by the DPRK are a cause for grave concern,"" the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a report published late on Monday. 
The report, which refers to the country's official name Democratic People's Republic of Korea, is to be submitted to the IAEA's board meeting next month.
U.S. President Donald Trump said in an interview with Reuters on Monday he believed North Korea had taken specific steps toward denuclearization and that he would ""most likely"" meet again with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Trump held a landmark summit with Kim on June 12, at which the North Korean leader agreed in broad terms to work toward denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. 
However, the country has given no indication it is willing to give up its weapons unilaterally as the Trump administration has demanded.
""As the agency remains unable to carry out verification activities in the DPRK, its knowledge of the DPRK's nuclear program is limited and, as further nuclear activities take place in the country, this knowledge is declining,"" the IAEA said. 
Between late April and early May there were indications of
the operation of the steam plant that serves a radiochemical laboratory, the report said. However, the duration of the steam plant's operation was not sufficient to have supported the reprocessing of a complete core from the experimental nuclear power plant reactor.

Dismantling Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program and verifying it would be a large and complex task. The IAEA has said it is best placed to verify a deal.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Western hostility towards Zimbabwe is deterring investment, the presidency spokesman said on Tuesday, comments in sharp contrast with President Emmerson Mnangagwa's previous efforts to woo Western governments.
Mnangagwa has made progress in improving Zimbabwe's relations with Western states before and after he won a July 30 presidential election, the first since the removal of long-time leader Robert Mugabe in a de facto coup last November.
But with a violent crackdown on opposition protesters by security forces after the election - a reminder to many of the repressive Mugabe era, the remarks by Mnangagwa's spokesman George Charamba signaled that his charm offensive towards the West may already be unraveling.
Mnangagwa's victory is being challenged in Zimbabwe's constitutional court this week by opposition leader Nelson Chamisa, who says the electoral commission rigged the vote. The commission has defended its independence. 
Economists say that for the southern African country to revive its struggling economy it needs to clear its arrears with Western donors and agree a financing program with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Charamba said Western states were preventing that.
""Of concern to investors is the continued hostility of the West, principally America which has been influencing IFIs (International Financial Institutions) negatively against Zimbabwe,"" Charamba said in an emailed response to questions about investor concerns over the election.
""This has delayed a resolution to the debt question, itself the elephant in the room.""
UNCERTAINTY
Charamba said delays caused by Chamisa's court challenge to Mnangagwa's election victory were also putting off investors.
""External partners - governmental and entrepreneurial - are irritated by the delay in closure to what in all estimate was a free, fair, democratic and credible electoral process,"" he said.
""Many investment projects have been waiting in the wings and the frustration of many investors who cannot wait much longer is palpable.""
There were hopes a peaceful vote would end Zimbabwe's pariah status and launch an economic recovery, but post-election unrest has raised uncomfortable comparisons with its violent past.
Mnangagwa, the 75-year-old former Mugabe ally, has urged Zimbabweans to unite behind him but questions linger over the death of six people in an army clampdown on protests against the ruling party's victory.
Mnangagwa has repeatedly expressed a desire to mend rifts with Western governments and has been pictured in recent weeks smiling with Western ambassadors in Harare.
He announced billions of dollars in investment commitments before the election, including from Western firms. 
As Zimbabwe became increasing isolated under Mugabe, it turned to China to help prop up its economy.

Charamba said that despite attempts by some ""intrusive foreigners"" to derail the country's progress, Zimbabwe had good relations with southern African governments and the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) states.

WASHINGTON/BERLIN (Reuters) - A 95-year old New York City man believed to be a former guard at a labor camp in Nazi-occupied Poland arrived in Germany after being arrested and deported by U.S. immigration authorities, U.S. officials said on Tuesday. 
The White House said Jakiw Palij served as a guard at the Trawniki Labor Camp, where about 6,000 Jewish men, women and children were shot dead on Nov. 3, 1943, in one of the single largest massacres of the Holocaust.
The United States had been trying to get Palij out of the country since the issue of a 2004 deportation order but after talks with top members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's government Germany agreed to take him in.
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said Palij had arrived by military plane at Duesseldorf airport in western Germany and taken to a home for the elderly in the area.
Born in what was then Poland but is now Ukraine, Palij emigrated to the United States in 1949, becoming a United States citizen eight years later, the White House said. 
But, it added, he had concealed his Nazi service and involvement in human rights abuses, saying he had spent World War Two working on a farm and in a factory. 
In 2001, Palij told Department of Justice officials that he had trained at the Nazi SS Training Camp in Trawniki, in German-occupied Poland, in 1943, the White House said.
""By serving as an armed guard ... and preventing the escape of Jewish prisoner during his Nazi service, Palij played an indispensable role in ensuring the Trawniki Jewish victims met their horrific fate at the hands of the Nazis,"" said the White House.
A federal judge revoked his U.S. citizenship in 2003 and he was ordered to be deported in 2004. But no European country would accept him, CNN and New York magazine reported.
Given his age and questions over his health and also a possible lack of proof, it is unclear whether German authorities will attempt to prosecute the stateless pensioner.
MORAL RESPONSIBILITY
The U.S. Ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, said the deportation was the result of a concerted effort by U.S. President Donald Trump. 
""He (Trump) told me directly to make it a priority, to get the Nazi out,"" Grenell told reporters. ""I felt very strongly that the German government had a moral obligation and they accepted that,"" he added, making clear it was up to Germany to decide whether to prosecute him.
Germany has a mixed record on convicting Nazi war criminals. Critics say it let many high-ranking Nazis and SS members escaped justice only for their juniors, small cogs in the Nazi death machine, to be put on trial decades later.
Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, who on Monday visited the Auschwitz camp, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung: 
""Germany, in whose name the worst injustice was perpetrated under the Nazis, is confronting its moral obligations."" 
After an international military tribunal put some top Nazi leaders, including Hermann Goering and Rudolf Hess, on trial soon after World War Two in the Nuremburg Trials, little action was taken by the West German judiciary in the 1950s and 1960s.
Between 1945 and 2005, West German courts convicted 6,656 Nazi criminals out of more than 36,000 investigations into more than 170,000 suspects, a study showed in 2008. 

Germany's Central office for the Investigation of Nazi Crimes in Ludwigsburg is still investigating individuals and the 2011 conviction of Sobibor death camp guard John Demjanjuk gave it a new impetus. It was the first time involvement in a camp was sufficient to be found culpable even without proof of a specific crime.

Lavrov was responding to an initiative by Britain's foreign minister, Jeremy Hunt, who is due to tell an audience in Washington later on Tuesday that London wants the EU, which it is in the process of leaving, to increase sanctions on Moscow. [nL8N1VC2YL]
Britain, the EU, and the United States blame Russia for a nerve agent attack against a former Russian double agent in Salisbury earlier this year. The Kremlin denies involvement.
""Our British colleagues have quite a high opinion of themselves,"" said Lavrov, who was speaking in the Black Sea resort of Sochi after holding talks with his Serbian counterpart. 
""A country which is leaving the European Union in the framework of Brexit is trying to dictate foreign policy to the European Union itself. And now, as it turns out, London wants to dictate foreign policy on Russia in Washington."" 
Lavrov said Moscow had many times offered to sit down with Britain and discuss problems affecting bilateral ties, but had always been rebuffed ""in a high-handed way."" 

He said Russia's offer of talks still stood however.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria's foreign minister was at the center of a storm of criticism on Tuesday after making a deep curtsey to Russian leader Vladimir Putin at her wedding, with critics blaming her for a naive gesture that would hurt her country's reputation.
The Kremlin leader, while not known to be a particularly close friend of the minister, Karin Kneissl, was the star guest at her wedding in an Austrian village at the weekend.
Video coverage showed Kneissl ending a waltz with Putin with a deep curtsey, a gesture that some Austrian media said would hand the Kremlin propaganda to the detriment of Austria for years to come.
""Kneissl's kneeling in front of Putin is a disgrace,"" the daily Der Standard said, adding: ""The foreign minister has lost all credibility by the way she handled Vladimir Putin.""
Kneissl, 53, a polyglot Middle East expert without political affiliation, was appointed to her job by the far-right Freedom Party which has a cooperation agreement with Putin's United Russia Party.
Her critics zeroed in on the fact that Austria is currently holding the presidency of the European Union at a time of increasing tensions between the bloc and Russia over a range of issues.
Austria did not follow other members of the EU this year in expelling Russian diplomats after Britain accused the Kremlin of involvement in the use of a nerve agent against a former Russian spy and his daughter in England - a charge Moscow denies.
For students of etiquette, there was much debate over whether Kneissl had curtseyed or whether she had bowed to the Kremlin leader at the end of their short waltz together.
A formal curtsey is a major element of Viennese ballroom etiquette, said Roman Svabek, owner of the dancing school that for the past ten years has organized the famous Vienna Opera Ball. 
Performing the so-called ""compliment"" at the end of the dance is intended to express the respect due to the person addressed, Svabek said.
The tradition dates back to the times of the Vienna congress, when international diplomats were sent to the balls in the Austrian Empire's capital to negotiate secret back-room deals, according to Svabek.
""It was a mixture of a curtsey and a bow,"" Svabek told Reuters on Tuesday, commenting on Kneissl's gesture. ""The lady typically curtsies, keeping her eyes up. A gentleman bows with his eyes cast down.""
Whether it was a bow or a curtsey, though, cut little ice with sections of the Austrian media. 
Enabling Kremlin propaganda ""to gleefully spread pictures where the Austrian representative is going down on her knees in front of Putin"" was a big mistake that will dog Austria for a long time, commented the daily Kleine Zeitung.
""Her (Kneissl's) overly deep curtsey to Vladimir Putin ... has become a political issue,"" said tabloid Oe24 on Tuesday.
""If she (Kneissl) had thought politically, she would not have invited him (Putin) to such a private event,"" former Czech Foreign Minister and veteran East-West diplomat Karel Schwarzenberg was quoted as saying by Der Standard. 
""But he immediately thought politically and accepted the invitation, because it allowed him to demonstrate normality.""

Trump told Reuters on Monday he would only consider lifting sanctions against Russia if it were to do something positive for the United States, for instance in Syria or in Ukraine.
Trump has repeatedly said he would like better ties with Moscow, but despite meeting President Vladimir Putin last month, relations have come under further strain as Washington announced new sanctions.
""We of course welcome statements that affirm a readiness to cooperate, but we would welcome even more some kind of concrete actions,"" Peskov said.
Peskov said the Kremlin would like to hear more details from the United States on any proposed cooperation in Syria and Ukraine, and that Kiev should also take positive steps. 
""We need to be specific about what is expected from Russia in terms of Ukraine, and why nothing is expected from the Ukrainian authorities,"" he said.

The scandal damaged the authority of Prime Minister Theresa May, who had led efforts to tackle illegal immigration when she led the Home Office, and resulted in the resignation of her interior minister Amber Rudd.
May said earlier this year that the treatment of thousands of migrants who were invited to fill labor shortages in post-war Britain on ships such as the Empire Windrush had been ""appalling"".
The government said 18 people had been identified in a review of removals and detentions affecting Caribbean nationals, of whom 11 went on voluntarily to leave Britain and seven were detained but subsequently released without being removed.
Fourteen of the 18 had been contacted and would be given the option to return, it said. They would also be guided to a compensation scheme.
Interior Minister Sajid Javid said the experiences faced by some members of the Windrush generation were completely unacceptable.
""I would like to personally apologize to those identified in our review and am committed to providing them with the support and compensation they deserve,"" he said on Tuesday.
""We must do everything we can to ensure that nothing like this happens again – which is why I have asked an independent adviser to look at what lessons we can learn from Windrush.""
The government also said 74 people were either detained or removed because they had lost their entitlement to stay in Britain after leaving for more than two years, and a further 72 people were detained temporarily at port but allowed to enter.
A task-force set up after the scandal had helped 2,272 people to get the documentation they needed to prove their existing right to be in the UK, the government said. 
A further 1,465 people had been granted citizenship or documentation to prove their status under a formal Windrush Scheme.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Two Cambodian journalists charged with espionage for filing news reports to a U.S.-funded radio station were freed on bail on Tuesday, in a move seen by a rights group as a government bid to improve its image weeks after a disputed election.
The case of the two reporters, Uon Chhin and Yeang Sothearin, compounded concern about a crackdown on criticism and dissent by Prime Minister Hun Sen, who extended his rule of more than three decades in a general election in July.
The two, who used to work for the Washington-based Radio Free Asia (RFA), had been in pre-trial detention since they were arrested in November and charged with espionage and producing pornography. They denied the charges.
Y Rin, a spokesman at the Phnom Penh Municipal Court, said the two had been released on bail but the charges against them would remain.
They smiled and hugged each other as they walked out of a prison on the outskirts of the capital, Phnom Penh.
""Actually, our freedom is not yet complete,"" Yeang Sothearin told reporters. 
""We are still required to show up in court and we demand the court to drop all charges,"" he said.
The government accused RFA, which broadcasts in the Khmer language, of being biased toward the opposition.
RFA shut down its Phnom Penh office last September complaining of a ""relentless crackdown on independent voices"", which made it impossible for it to guarantee the integrity of its journalistic mission.
Hun Sen has accused the United States of trying to end his rule of more than 33 years.
The releases were the latest in a what Chak Sopheap, executive director at the Cambodian Center for Human Rights, said was an attempt by the government to improve its image.
Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party won all 125 seats in the election after the main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party was dissolved.
""This seems to be an attempt on the part of the authorities to regain some form of legitimacy in the eyes of the international community and of the Cambodian people,"" Chak Sopheap told Reuters. 
Political analyst Kim Sok was released on Aug. 17 after serving 18 months on what he said were politically motivated charges. Land rights activist Tep Vanny was pardoned this week after two years in prison.
RFA spokesman Rohit Mahajan welcomed the release of the reporters.
""While this is a positive development, all charges against them should be dropped and their case dismissed,"" he said.

960,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2018 08:38AM ET</span>",Indonesian Buddhist woman imprisoned for complaining mosque too loud,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - An Indonesian court sentenced a Buddhist woman to 18 months in prison for blasphemy on Tuesday, after she was accused of insulting Islam for complaining that neighborhood mosque was too loud.
Meiliana, a 44-year old ethnic Chinese Buddhist had complained the Muslim call to prayer, repeated five times a day, was being played too loudly at the mosque near her house in North Sumatra.
Indonesia has the world’s largest population of Muslims and sizable Buddhist, Christian and other religious minorities. Recent years have seen a rise in conservative and hardline interpretations of Islam, prompting fears that the secular nation’s long-standing reputation for tolerance and diversity was being eroded.
""She had said something that insulted religion, in this case Islam,"" said Jamaluddin, spokesman of the Medan district court, adding the defendant had “showed remorse and apologized”.
Political activists have said the country’s stringent blasphemy laws are being used to bully minorities and violate religious freedoms.
Last year, the former ethnic Chinese governor of Jakarta was tried and jailed for blasphemy after several Muslim groups accused him of insulting Islam when he said his political rivals were using the Koran to deceive voters. 
The ruling was widely condemned and believed to be politically motivated. Basuki Tjahaja Purnama also lost his re-election bid because of the accusations.
There are hundreds of thousands of mosques across the vast archipelago and most use loudspeakers to play the ‘azan’ or call to prayer, which lasts a few minutes. But many also play lengthy versions of prayers or sermons lasting over 30 minutes, which has been deemed unnecessary by the Indonesian Mosque Council.
Vice President Jusuf Kalla, who is also a member of the Council, formed a team in 2015 to review mosques’ use of loudspeakers and regulate their use and volume. He has previously called on mosques to use their public address systems “wisely”.
Kalla’s spokesman did not respond to requests for comment on Meiliana’s conviction.

Meiliana's lawyer, Ranto Sibarani, said they would appeal the verdict, according to The Jakarta Post.

YANGON (Reuters) - The United Nations is awaiting “effective access” to the Myanmar region where 700,000 Rohingya Muslims were driven out in an army crackdown, months after agreeing with the government to aid the return of refugees, the U.N. country head said on Tuesday.
The organization's agencies for development and refugees – UNDP and UNHCR – signed a memorandum of understanding with Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi’s government in June to allow Rohingya who fled to Bangladesh last year to return home.
But requests for authorizations for staff to visit the conflict area have been beset by delays and authorities have offered access to a limited area, Knut Ostby, the U.N. resident and humanitarian coordinator in Myanmar, told Reuters. 
Ostby said the United Nations had declined to accept an offer from the government to work in a limited number of villages and would not send in experts until it had negotiated a better deal.
“They’re standing ready to go when we have effective access,” he said. 
“We need to have the possibility to do a proper job.”
His comments came despite an announcement from Suu Kyi on Tuesday that her government had ""granted access"" to the United Nations to work in 23 villages across northern Rakhine State as part of a “pilot assessment program”. 
The United Nations wants to implement “quick impact projects” to benefit the population still there, including cash-for-work schemes and small-scale infrastructure projects.
Ostby said he did not know how the 23 villages, spread out across Maungdaw and Buthidaung townships, had been selected. 
The United Nations wanted to work in villages next to one another, he said, to avoid the risk of creating “inequality among neighboring villages”.
Government spokesman Zaw Htay said the United Nations could work within the selected areas first and then expand its operations.
“As far as I understand, UNDP is to implement pilot project within the allowed villages and extend afterwards,” Zaw Htay said. “If UNDP does not think it’s enough, they would have to discuss with the government.”
The United Nations as been mostly barred from northern Rakhine State since August last year, when the government accused U.N. agencies of supplying food to Rohingya militants. 
The Rohingya, who regard themselves as native to Rakhine state, are widely considered as interlopers by Myanmar's Buddhist majority and are denied citizenship.
The June deal between the United Nations and the government was not made public, but a draft was seen by Reuters and also leaked online last month.
Refugee leaders and human rights groups said the deal failed to give assurances that returning refugees would be granted citizenship and freedom of movement.
Ostby said the United Nations had advocated for the release of the memorandum of understanding.

“We have proposed to the government that it would be a good idea to make it public,” he said. “Having said that, we recognize that such agreements are not normally publicized in other countries.”

BEIRUT (Reuters) - For Mazen Rahhal, a shopowner in a bustling district of Beirut, Lebanon's economy has seldom felt more precarious. In one store, he sells clothes at a fraction of their previous price. Another, which he rented to a rival business, now lies empty. 
Years of gradual stagnation have in 2018 merged with several newer trends: high interest rates, falling house prices and questions about the currency at a moment of profound uncertainty as politicians wrangle over forming a new government.
For Lebanese businesses and people, economic unease and the lack of a government to take firm control over policy - some three months after they voted in a general election - have become ceaseless sources of worry. 
""We are struggling just to manage the costs we have to pay: from electricity, employee wages, everything,"" said Rahhal. His family has owned shops on Hamra Street, the main business thoroughfare of west Beirut, since the 1970s. 
As Lebanon rebuilt after its 15-year civil war ended in 1990, there was a period of economic growth, and as in its 1950s and 60s heyday, it drew Gulf Arab tourists ready to open their wallets as they escaped the stifling summer heat of home.
But problems were never far away. 
In 2005 prime minister Rafik al-Hariri was assassinated, opening up wide divisions over the roles of the Iran-backed Hezbollah group, and of powerful neighbor Syria. 
Syria's own war since 2011 has aggravated those rifts, while cutting off much of Lebanon's overland trade and scaring off the mostly Sunni Muslim Gulf tourists, who feared the growing power of the heavily armed Shi'ite Hezbollah movement. 
Sclerosis ensued. After Hariri's death, the government did not pass another state budget until last year. Parliamentary elections in 2009 were not held again until this May. 
Economic growth, which averaged 8-10 percent before the Syria war, has averaged 1-2 percent since it began, and a purchasing managers' index for Blom Bank has shown business activity in decline every month since 2013. 
The state owes about 150 percent of the gross domestic product, much of it to local banks, whose own business is partly based on remittances paid into them by Lebanese working abroad, in turn partly drawn by attractive interest rates. 
DIFFICULTIES 
Khoury Home is a major business in Lebanon. Its shops, a familiar sight across the country, sell home appliances. 
Romen Mathieu said he had told his staff every year since becoming the company's chairman in 2013 that the coming year would be more difficult than the last. 
""Now we reached 2018, and this year is disastrous, and I think we still didn't see the tough part of this year,"" he said. ""If I have to say it in 2019, there won't be anyone listening to me any more.""
Compounding Mathieu's difficulties, the government last year scaled back a series of incentives to banks for home loans, which contributed to a dip in the housing market. As fewer people bought houses, fewer wanted new fridges or televisions. 
""Let's not make fools of each other. There is no money in the market and we need to adapt to this situation and get used to it,"" said Mathieu. 
Not all businesses are suffering. Supermarket chain Spinneys has increased sales volumes because many of its goods are imported from Europe, and currency fluctuation has brought prices down, said chief executive Michael Wright. 
""We are selling more, our volumes are going up. But that's balanced by a price drop,"" he said. 
Since May's election the rival political parties have squabbled over forming a new national unity government - one that contains enough of the major parties to ensure political backing across the country. 
Without a new government, Lebanon cannot institute the fiscal reforms needed to get its debt under control or unlock billions of dollars in pledged foreign investment in infrastructure to get the economy moving. 
Everybody Reuters interviewed said it was critical for Lebanon to form a government soon. 
Meanwhile, interest rates have risen as the authorities increasingly try to attract higher levels of the bank deposits on which government debt relies. 
Those high rates are hurting too. 
Jessy Kojababian has been engaged for two years. Her wedding was fixed for September. But as interest rates rose, and the government incentives for banks to offer housing loans were scaled back, she and her fiance could no longer afford to buy a house. 
They have now canceled the wedding.

""We were already booking everything for the wedding. The roses, the restaurant, the church. Everything. We paid a deposit of $6,000, so how can we get it back?"" she said.

Norman Bettison had been charged with four offences of misconduct in public office related to statements he made in the aftermath of the disaster and about the culpability of fans which prosecutors believed were untrue.
The victims, all Liverpool supporters, died in an overcrowded, fenced-in enclosure at the Hillsborough stadium in Sheffield, northern England, during an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.
Police at first blamed the tragedy on drunken fans, an explanation that was always rejected by survivors, relatives of the victims and the wider Liverpool community. Families spent decades campaigning for justice for the 96. 
Prosecutors announced last year that they would bring criminal charges against six people including Bettison and other former police chiefs over the deaths and an alleged subsequent cover-up by police of their own mistakes. 
The Crown Prosecution Service said on Tuesday they had discontinued the case against Bettison however following a number of developments. ""These include changes in the evidence of two witnesses and the death of a third witness,"" it said.
As a result there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction.
""I appreciate this news will be disappointing for the families and the CPS will meet with them in person to explain the decision,"" it added.
The families of those who died at Hillsborough said they were bitterly disappointed with the decision. 
Speaking outside court where the charges were dropped, Steve Kelly, whose brother Michael died in the disaster, said: ""I'm absolutely devastated. I feel as if I've been beaten up this morning.""
The main campaign group said it would be exercising its right to an independent review. 
In a brief statement outside court, Bettison said his role around Hillsborough had been misrepresented. 
""I've been forced to deny strenuously that I have done anything wrong in the aftermath of the disaster and today's outcome vindicates that position,"" he said. 

Charges remain in place against other officers including former police chief superintendent David Duckenfield who was in charge of police operations at Hillsborough on the fateful day. He was charged with manslaughter by gross negligence.

The Raganello creek, part of the Pollino National Park, runs through the narrow gorge, which is one kilometer (0.8 miles) deep with sheer rock walls that are only about four meters (13 ft) wide in some places. 
Dozens of people were exploring the gorge when a storm dumped heavy rain upstream, and the narrow canyon funneled the runoff into a raging wall of water and debris that engulfed some hikers and sent others scrambling to higher ground.
Meteorologists had warned of possible heavy rains in the area.
The death toll was revised down to 10 from 11, a number announced erroneously by the civil protection agency earlier on Tuesday, he said.
""The search is still ongoing,"" Malagrino said from the town of Civita, which is near the gorge, which attracts many tourists in summer.
""We're conducting operations to find the missing in the creek bed all the way to the sea,"" said Nicola Capitale, a helicopter pilot for the fire department. 
Squads of rescuers used spotlights in search-and-rescue operations overnight, and helicopters took to the air at first light. The disaster follows less than a week after a motorway bridge collapsed in northern Italy, killing 43.
The nationalities of the dead and injured were not yet released, but most tourists and trekkers who visit the area, in the country's deep south, are Italian.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Myanmar government leader Aung San Suu Kyi said on Tuesday her relationship with the military - which held her under house arrest for nearly 15 years - was ""not that bad"" and that the generals in her cabinet were ""rather sweet"". 
However, Suu Kyi, who has been criticized for failing to speak out against an army crackdown in Rakhine State that the United Nations has called ""ethnic cleansing"", said she hoped constitutional change would eventually curb the military's influence.
""Our relationship with the army is not that bad,"" the Nobel peace prize laureate and the face of Myanmar's democratic awakening, said at an event in Singapore in response to a question about whether she feared another military coup. 
""Don't forget that we have three members of the cabinet who are in fact military men, generals, and they're all rather sweet.""
The military ruled Myanmar for nearly 50 years after seizing power in a 1962 coup.
The generals have initiated reforms, beginning in late 2010 with Suu Kyi's release from house arrest, and they have largely stepped back from the day-to-day running of the country, handing over to Suu Kyi's government after her party swept a 2015 election.
But the military retains considerable powers under a 2008 constitution and Suu Kyi, barred under that constitution from becoming president, said the transition to democracy was ""still incomplete"".
Suu Kyi did not mention by name the Rohingya Muslims, more than 700,000 of whom have fled from the north of Rakhine State into Bangladesh since an army crackdown that began a year ago after attacks on security posts by Rohingya insurgents.
The Aug. 25 attacks were launched by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, which Myanmar says is a terrorist group, and Suu Kyi said terrorism remained a threat, which could have ""grave consequences"" for the wider region.
""The danger of terrorist activities, which was the initial cause of events leading to the humanitarian crisis in Rakhine remains real and present today,"" she said.
""Unless this security challenge is addressed the risk of inter-communal violence will remain. It is a threat that could have grave consequences, not just for Myanmar but also for other countries in our region and beyond.""
Myanmar has rejected accusations of ethnic cleansing and dismissed most accounts from refugees of atrocities, instead blaming Rohingya ""terrorists"".
'BANGLADESH TO DECIDE'
Buddhist-majority Myanmar and Bangladesh reached an agreement late last year on the repatriation of Rohingya, most of whom are stateless and subjected to restrictions in Myanmar.
Suu Kyi said spaces have been mapped out for the resettlement of people who fled.
She also stressed the difficulties that other small ethnic and religious groups living in Rakhine State face.
""There are not just the Muslims in Rakhine, like most people think. There's Hindus there, there are ... small ethnic groups and I would like you to take interest in these small ethnic groups because some of them are disappearing very quickly,"" she said.
""They live in their own traditional ways, they're very peaceful ... we must do everything we can to help them to preserve their culture, their traditions and to help them prosper.""
On plans for Rohingya refugees to return to Myanmar, she said it was difficult to set a time frame, suggesting the onus was on Bangladesh to get the process started.
""The returnees have to be sent back by Bangladesh. We can only welcome them at the border,"" she said. ""I think Bangladesh would also have to decide how quickly it wants the process to be completed.""

The Rohingya, who regard themselves as native to Rakhine State, are widely considered as interlopers by Myanmar's Buddhist majority and are denied citizenship.

968,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2018 06:30AM ET</span>","More refugees find jobs in Germany, integration going 'pretty well'","BERLIN (Reuters) - A growing number of migrants are finding jobs in Germany, according to data released on Tuesday that will give heart to supporters of Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to let in hundreds of thousands of war refugees since 2015.
Figures last week also showed that German companies have managed to attract more apprentices to on-the-job training schemes due to a surge in applications from asylum seekers from Afghanistan and Syria. 
The figures will feed into a running debate in Germany on the impact of Merkel's decision in 2015 to open German borders to more than a million migrants, many of them refugees from war zones in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan.
Critics including the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party have said the new arrivals will be a burden on Germany's welfare system and economy.
But the head of Germany's Labor Office, Detlef Scheele, told dpa news agency there was no reason to be overly pessimistic about the country's ability to cope with the record number of arrivals.
""This is all going pretty well,"" he said, adding that the numbers were slightly better than expected. ""These are good numbers, also taking into account that the people came here for humanitarian reasons and not for finding a job,"" Scheele added.
The number of employed migrants from the eight countries with the biggest numbers of asylum seekers surged by more than 100,000 to 306,574 in May compared with the same month in the previous year, data from the Labor Office showed.
SKILLED LABOR SHORTAGE
Among those, roughly three out of four had a labor contract in which the company and the employee were paying full contributions to social insurance schemes, the data showed.
There were roughly 500,000 people from the eight main asylum seeker countries who were registered as looking for work in July, the data showed. This includes people who are currently completing an integration and language course.
Among those, nearly 197,000 people were registered as unemployed which is roughly in line with the level seen a year earlier, the data showed.
Shortages of skilled labor and a lack of young people willing to commit to on-the-job training for up to 3-1/2 years have become big concerns for managers in Europe's largest economy.
Vacancies for training positions have reached their highest level in more than 20 years with more than a third of companies unable to fill all of their training spots.

The number of new arrivals in Germany has fallen sharply this year, partly due to stricter border controls across Europe as well as tighter asylum rules in Germany and other countries.

969,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2018 05:10AM ET</span>","Eyeing U.S., Iran says to boost military might, unveils new fighter jet","By Bozorgmehr Sharafedin
LONDON (Reuters) - Iran said on Tuesday it would boost its military might and also unveiled a new fighter jet amid increased tensions with the United States and with regional rivals over conflicts in the Middle East.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the Islamic Republic's military prowess was what deterred Washington from attacking it, adding that under President Donald Trump the United States was becoming isolated even from its own allies.
""We should make ourselves ready to fight against the military powers who want to take over our territory and our resources,"" Rouhani said in a speech broadcast live on state television ahead of Wednesday's National Defence Industry Day.
""Why does the United States not attack us? Because of our power, because it knows the consequences,"" Rouhani added.
Last week, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also said the United States would avoid any military confrontation with Tehran because of Iranian military might.
Khamenei has rejected Trump's offer of unconditional talks on a new nuclear deal, prompting Trump to tell Reuters in an interview on Monday: ""If they want to meet, that's fine, and if they don't want to meet, I couldn't care less.""
Relations between Washington and Tehran worsened further after Trump in May took the United States out of an international deal that curbed Tehran's nuclear program in return for an easing of economic sanctions.
Trump branded that 2015 deal as flawed because it did not address Iran's missile program or involvement in conflicts in Syria and Yemen, and he has reimposed U.S. economic sanctions.
LOSS OF TRUST IN US
Rouhani compared the sanctions on Iran with the U.S. trade war with China and its new tariffs on some imports from Turkey and European countries. 
""It's not only us who do not trust America. Today even Europe and China do not trust them; even American allies like Canada have lost their trust,"" he said.
Earlier on Tuesday Rouhani attended a ceremony, broadcast by state TV, that included the fly-past of a new home-made fighter jet called Kowsar, which is capable of carrying various weapons, and will be used for short aerial support missions. 
Iran has sent weapons and thousands of soldiers to Syria to help prop up President Bashar al-Assad's forces, but had to rely on Russia for aerial support due to its own lack of a powerful air force.
Iran’s air force has been limited to perhaps a few dozen strike aircraft using either Russian or aging U.S. models acquired before the 1979 Iranian revolution.
Iran unveiled in 2013 what it said was a new, domestically built fighter jet, called Qaher 313, but some experts expressed doubts about the viability of the aircraft at the time.

Iran has developed a large domestic arms industry in the face of international sanctions and embargoes that have barred it from importing many weapons.

TAIPEI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Taiwan vowed on Tuesday to fight China's ""increasingly out of control"" behavior after Taipei lost another ally to Beijing when El Salvador became the third country to switch allegiances to China this year.
Taiwan now has formal relations with only 17 countries worldwide, many of them small, less developed nations in Central America and the Pacific, including Belize and Nauru.
Speaking in Taipei, President Tsai Ing-wen said Taiwan would not bow to pressure, describing El Salvador's decision as further evidence of China's efforts to squeeze the island, which have included regular Chinese bomber patrols around Taiwan.
""We will turn to countries with similar values to fight together against China's increasingly out-of-control international behavior,"" Tsai said.
Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu told reporters earlier that Taipei was not willing to engage in ""money competition"" with its giant neighbor. 
He said El Salvador had been continuously asking for ""massive funding support"" since last year for a port development, but Taiwan was unable to assist with the ""unsuitable project"" after assessment. 
""Pressure from China would only make Taiwan more determined to continue our path of democracy and freedom,"" he said.
""China's rude and unreasonable behavior will certainly have negative impact to cross-strait relations. This is also not how a responsible country should behave."" 
Beijing considers Taiwan to be a wayward province of “one China”, ineligible for state-to-state relations, and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control.
In Beijing, the Chinese government's top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, said El Salvador had made the right decision.
""I'm confident that the people of El Salvador will feel the warmth and friendship of the Chinese people and derive tangible benefits from its cooperation with China,"" Wang told reporters alongside his El Salvador counterpart, Carlos Castaneda, shortly after the pair signed an agreement establishing ties.
'EXTRAORDINARY OPPORTUNITIES'
El Salvador's president, Salvador Sanchez Ceren, announced in a nationally televised speech that his government had broken off diplomatic relations with Taiwan and instead established ties with China.
Sanchez Ceren said the central American country, which built ties with the Republic of China government in 1933, would see ""great benefits"" and ""extraordinary opportunities"" in the new relationship with Beijing.
Taiwan's formal name is the Republic of China, whose government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with the Communists. 
""We are convinced this is a step in the right direction that corresponds to the principles of international law of international relations and the inevitable trends of our time,"" he said. 
In Beijing, Castaneda said it was a strategic decision his government made to ""create conditions to change the historical standing of our country and to really elevate the livelihood of our people"". 
Taiwan has accused China of luring its friends away with offers of generous aid packages. China denies that.
Graphic showing Taiwan's political allies - http://tmsnrt.rs/2hpQ0xx
The news comes as Tsai wrapped up a high-profile trip to Latin America, including stops in the United States, that drew anger from China. 
""China will not get unification with Taiwan by luring away our allies. What China did was to humiliate Taiwan repeatedly without getting any respect from Taiwan's people,"" Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party wrote in a statement. 
El Salvador is the fifth country Taiwan will lose as a diplomatic ally since Tsai came to office in 2016, following Burkina Faso, the Dominican Republic, Sao Tome and Principe and Panama.
The U.S. ambassador in El Salvador, Jean Manes, wrote in a Twitter post on Tuesday the United States was analyzing El Salvador's ""worrisome"" decision to break ties with Taiwan.
""Without a doubt, this will impact our relationship with the (Salvadoran) government. We continue supporting the Salvadoran people,"" she wrote without elaborating. 
Ahead of next month's summit between China and African leaders in Beijing, China has also been upping the pressure on Taiwan's last remaining ally on the continent, eSwatini, formerly known as Swaziland, to come over to China's side, diplomatic sources say.
""We hope the relevant country can see clearly the world's trend,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a daily news briefing, when asked whether eSwatini would attend the summit.

China's hostility to Taiwan has grown since Tsai's election as Beijing fears she wishes to push for the island's formal independence, a red line for China. She says she wants to maintain the status quo but will defend Taiwan's democracy.

971,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2018 04:41AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Iraq to ask U.S. for exemptions on some Iran sanctions,"By Ahmed Rasheed and Ahmed Aboulenein
BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq's economy is so closely linked to Iran that Baghdad is going to ask Washington for permission to ignore some U.S. sanctions on its neighbor, Iraqi government and central bank officials said.
U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from an international deal aimed at limiting Iran's nuclear program earlier this year and reimposed trade sanctions. 
Washington has said there will be consequences for countries that do not respect the sanctions. 
Baghdad is in a difficult position. Iraq imports crucial supplies from ally Iran but its other major ally is the United States, which provides security assistance and training.
The request would mark an important change in political tactics for Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. He initially said Baghdad would respect all the U.S. sanctions but faced heavy criticism from rivals.
The officials told Reuters a delegation will travel to Washington to ask for exemptions in applying the sanctions. They did not say when that trip would take place.
""The government plans to ask Washington for a waiver. It's going to happen soon,"" one central bank official said.
An official in Abadi's office declined to comment.
An official in the U.S. State Department said it was discussing Iran policy with its partners around the world.
""We have given the same message to all countries around the world that the President has said, the United States is fully committed to enforcing all of our sanctions,"" the official said.
""Iraq is a friend and important partner of the U.S and we are we are committed to ensuring Iraqi stability and prosperity."" 
Iraqi officials fear shortages of key items if Baghdad complies with all the sanctions. This could lead to political turmoil at a delicate time in Iraqi politics. 
Iraq imports a wide range of goods from Iran including food, agricultural products, home appliances, air conditioners and spare car parts. The goods element of Iranian imports to Iraq was about $6 billion for the 12 months ending March 2018, about 15 percent of Iraq's total imports for 2017.
There are also energy contracts between the two countries contributing to a volume of trade of $12 billion last year. 
The officials said they were asking each ministry to put together a list of imports that are essential for Iraq's economy. Those items will make up the request for exemptions. 
The U.S. sanctions that came into effect earlier this month target Iran's trade in gold and other precious metals, its purchases of U.S. dollars and its car industry. Other sanctions will come into force in November.
EUROS NOT DOLLARS
Abadi has said Iraq will still respect the requirement on U.S. dollar purchases, which is a major part of the sanctions and one of the most awkward for businesses, given energy and other big trade deals. 
It means that Iraqi banks and the government cannot pay the Iranian government or Iranian entities in dollars.
The central bank circulated a warning to private banks to abide by the ban on dollar transactions but it will allow transactions in euros, one central bank official said.
Several European countries, including France, Britain and Germany wanted the United States to stick by the international nuclear deal. The EU is working to maintain trade with Iran.
""We were encouraged by the position of European Union states toward Iran in respect to the American sanctions. They keep dealing with Iran in euros so why shouldn't we?"" a second Iraqi central bank official said.
SPARE CAR PARTS
The sanctions are particularly sensitive for companies with U.S. operations. Trump has said that those who do business in Iran will not be able to do business in the United Sates.
But most Iraqi private companies will be relatively unharmed by the sanctions, said a Western diplomat in Baghdad.
""Plenty of Iraqi businesses don't have U.S. investments, don't deal in dollars. Those can carry on dealing with Iran without issue,"" he said.
It is government and public sector-run energy, construction and car industries, which will take a bigger hit, one Iraqi trade ministry official told Reuters. 
""We rely mainly on Iran as a source of construction materials and automobiles, including spare parts, due to low prices and the ease of shipping through many joint border crossings,"" he said.
COMPLIANCE DIFFICULTIES
Even if the government has committed to complying with some of the sanctions, it may be difficult to enforce.
Local traders may still be happy to deal with Iranian counterparts because the fall of the Iranian rial against the U.S. dollar has made goods cheap and political and economic ties between the two countries are strong. 
""It will be mission impossible for the government to prevent Iranian commodities from flowing across more than 1,300 kilometers (808 miles) of joint borders,"" said Basim Antwan, a leading Iraqi economic consultant and member of the Iraqi Businessmen Union. 
""Iran will use every single option at hand to keep the exports flowing, including the help of allied militia groups to secure what could be called 'organized smuggling'.""
Abadi is leading a fragile caretaker cabinet while political parties try to negotiate a new governing coalition after a May election in which his bloc came third.
He has managed to balance U.S. and Iranian interests and hopes to stay on as a compromise premier. 
But he may have been damaged after declaring he would fully comply with the U.S. sanctions. This could have helped his more pro-Iran rivals, who heavily criticized his decision.
Some Western diplomats say he must now come up with a compromise to balance U.S. and Iranian interests. 

""There is a fear that Washington will force Iraq into a 'you are with us or against us' situation,"" the Western diplomat said. ""They should not force Iraq to make that choice.""

Nearly 200 passengers were taken as hostages by Taliban insurgents near the northern province of Kunduz on Monday as they traveled to the capital, Kabul.
""More than 160 civilians have reached home safely but at least 20 soldiers and policemen have been taken to an undisclosed location by the Taliban,"" said Ghulam Rabani Rabani, a provincial council member in Kunduz.
Two Taliban commanders confirmed the release of the civilians. One said the insurgents had no intention of harming the civilians, who were traveling during the Eid al-Adha holiday, but they would hold the police and soldiers as prisoners.

It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the rocket attack, which came two days after Ghani offered the Taliban a conditional three-month ceasefire.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Samai Distillery, which has the distinction of being Cambodia's first, and only, rum producer, is looking to export the tipple to new international markets.
Founded in 2014 by three South Americans, including Venezuelan CEO Antonio López de Haro, the boutique distillery exports rum to France and Singapore, and aims to enter markets in Malaysia, Japan, Hong Kong and Spain by next year.
""We are looking at a few pallets, we are talking maybe around 2,000 bottles per country, per year,"" López de Haro told Reuters in an interview.
Currently, the company of 16 employees produces 500 bottles of rum a month, each bottled by hand. Two of its brands, Samai's Gold Rum and Kampot Pepper Rum were awarded gold medals at the Madrid International Rum Conference in 2017.
According to a 2017 report by Orbis Research, premium brands are driving demand growth in the rum market, but rum's top three markets – India, the United States and the Philippines – are all likely to record falls in sales during the period 2016 to 2021 due to high competition from non-alcoholic beverages.
López de Haro started the distillery, which is located in a small alley in the capital Phnom Penh, with his high-school friend Daniel Pacheco, and another partner, Diego Wilkins, from Uruguay, after discovering that no one was producing rum in Cambodia despite an abundance locally of sugarcane, a key ingredient.
""The molasses that we found are really high quality but we were quite surprised that there was no Cambodian rum,"" he said.
López de Haro said demand for rum is growing in Cambodia, where people have traditionally favored beer, whisky and local rice wine.
However, Rémy Choisy, a French national who runs a rum bar in Phnom Penh, said more advertising was needed to make more Cambodians aware of the drink.

""In Cambodia, people only drink sugarcane juice,"" Choisy said. ""They don't know so much about rum.""

The land-starved island is known for its gleaming skyscrapers and contemporary architectural designs that punctuate its skyline like the Marina Bay Sands hotel, which looks like a surfboard perched atop three towers.
While the city has preserved some buildings from its colonial past, the Singapore Heritage Society (SHS) said on Tuesday more needed to be done to preserve brutalist blocks built just after the city-state achieved independence in 1965.
In a paper titled ""Too Young to Die"", the non-governmental society picked out some of the first high-rise buildings that helped transform Singapore from a British colonial backwater to the global trade and financial center it is today. 
Buildings mentioned include the horseshoe-shaped Pearl Bank Apartments, which was the tallest residential building in Singapore when it was completed in 1976, just outside the new financial district.
It was sold this year for S$728 million ($531 million) to developer CapitaLand Ltd, which plans to build a new residential tower of 800 units in its place.
The SHS said Pearl Bank, along with People's Park Complex, a hulking yellow and green edifice that towers over Chinatown, and the Golden Mile Complex, with its unique stepped-terrace design, were of great historical and architectural significance.
Media has reported that People's Park and the Golden Mile Complex, which were also completed in the 1970s, are to be put up for sale.
""It is timely for current land-use policies and regulatory frameworks to be reevaluated to facilitate the conservation of modernist structures for adaptive reuse, and for private owners and developers to plan for a longer building lifespan,"" the SHS said.
Authorities have since the 1970s granted heritage status to more than 7,000 buildings in more 100 parts of Singapore, including colorful shophouses, so-called black-and-white bungalows, mosques and temples.
But Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in a National Day Rally speech on Sunday that Singapore had to think about future generations.
""We may keep a few blocks for historical or heritage value or sentimental reasons, or to remind people what the old days are like, but these should be the exception,"" Lee said.

""For the others we can rebuild, newer, better, more liveable flats, blocks, townships more suited to what our grandchildren and great grandchildren will want to live in.""

Mahathir made the comments while addressing the media in Beijing during his five-day trip to China. He said the projects would be canceled until such time as Malaysia can afford it.
The Prime Minister's office confirmed the comments Mahathir made to reporters in Beijing. 
Mahathir said he relayed the matter to China and they understood the problems faced by Malaysia, the New Straits Times (NST) reported.
""I believe China itself does not want to see Malaysia become a bankrupt country,"" the NST quoted him as saying during a press conference marking the end of his China trip.
Mahathir suspended unpopular Chinese projects in Malaysia after he returned to power in a stunning election victory in May that ended the decade long rule of former premier Najib Razak.
The ECRL project was the centerpiece of China's infrastructure push in Malaysia but work has been suspended pending discussions over pricing and graft accusations.
Mahathir said in a joint press conference with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Monday that he believed China would sympathize with his country's ""internal fiscal problems"".
Prior to his China visit, he had vowed repeatedly to discuss what he called ""unfair"" Chinese infrastructure deals authorized by former premier Najib Razak. 
Mahathir also told the press on Tuesday that he did not bring up Low Taek Jho, the Malaysian financier wanted for his role in the multi-billion-dollar scandal at state fund 1MDB, in his dialogue with the Chinese leaders, local reports said.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Malaysia believed Low was being harbored in China and that a request to extradite him would be high on Mahathir's agenda during his five-day trip. Reuters could not verify the report.

978,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 20, 2018 10:10PM ET</span>",Wounded Turnbull Survives Australia Leadership Ballot,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull survived a leadership vote on Tuesday but may be challenged again within days amid growing unease among party colleagues about the government’s slumping poll ratings.
Turnbull defeated Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton by 48 votes to 35 in a ballot of Liberal Party lawmakers in Canberra. While the win hands Turnbull a reprieve, the size of the vote against him shows just how wide the rifts within government are.
Dutton, a former policeman who’s become a lightning rod for government lawmakers dismayed by Turnbull’s policy direction, resigned from the Cabinet following the vote. He remains on the backbench, where he’s free to lobby for the extra votes he’d need to take the leadership. Turnbull may decide to seize the initiative and call a snap election, Sky News reported.
“The dead-man walking scenario looks writ large over Turnbull,” said Haydon Manning, an associate professor of politics and public policy at Flinders University. “This has the classic look of a two-stage act -- the first challenge narrowly fails but sets the scene for a successful second one.”
Turnbull, 63, has struggled for policy traction and political authority since his Liberal-National coalition retained office in 2016 by a razor-thin margin. The government has trailed the main opposition Labor party in opinion polls ever since, and with elections due by May, disquiet over Turnbull’s leadership has been growing.
Wounded Authority
His authority was wounded in the past week as several backbench lawmakers threatened to vote against a key energy policy, demanding the government provide more support for the coal industry and abandon its Paris Agreement emissions target.
“For business, what we need is clarity,” Elizabeth Gaines, chief executive officer of Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. told Bloomberg Television in an interview Tuesday. Perth-based Fortescue, the world’s No. 4 iron ore exporter, is investing about $1.3 billion in a new mine and rail project in Western Australia. “We need to have some clarity in terms of policy, it’s really important for those long-term investment decisions,” Gaines said.
Turnbull has been dogged by misfortune and missteps since the 2016 election. While he shepherded through legislation allowing same-sex couples to marry, has shrunk the budget deficit and enacted tax cuts for small businesses, other policies have been stymied in parliament.
The country has had 27 years without recession, yet the government has failed to reap a political dividend due to stagnant wages, spiraling power bills, high levels of household debt and property prices that are beyond the reach of many Australians.
Political Dysfunction
The leadership turmoil is nothing new. Turnbull himself seized power by defeating Tony Abbott in a ballot of Liberal lawmakers in 2015. The previous Labor government was equally chaotic -- with first term Prime Minister Kevin Rudd ousted by his deputy Julia Gillard, only to claw his way back to the top job weeks before losing the 2013 election.
Such political dysfunction has damaged the nation’s prospects, with successive governments failing to enact reform across key areas such as energy, housing policies and taxation.
“We are rightly a laughing stock -- it’s hard for watchers around the world to understand Australian politics,” said Jill Sheppard, a political analyst at the Australian National University. “What we’ve seen is a huge turnover in prime ministers now. Some of the people we’re electing just aren’t very good, they’re not very responsible and they’re not very charismatic.”
Dutton, 47, is seen as a leader of the party’s right wing, and has risen to prominence as a staunch supporter of the government’s hard-line policy of detaining asylum seekers in offshore camps. He’s been accused by human rights advocates of creating racial division by urging a crackdown on “African gang violence” in Victoria state, and if voted in as leader could announce cuts to immigration.
Unless Turnbull can swiftly heal rifts within the government and close Labor’s lead in opinion polls, he may face a further challenge -- potentially as soon as this week or in the next parliamentary sitting in September. The opposition party leads the government 55 percent to 45 percent, according to a Fairfax-Ipsos poll published Monday -- a wide enough margin to win the next election by a landslide.
“He needs to pull a policy rabbit out of the hat that somehow shows strength of leadership and unify the government,” said Manning. “The fact the vote is so close means Turnbull would have to have a faultless run to lead the government to victory at the next election, and the chances of that look increasingly remote.”

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un took aim at his country's health sector, state media reported on Tuesday, the latest salvo of public criticism unleashed as part of his campaign to jumpstart economic development. 
Since a June summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Singapore - where Kim lauded the city-state's economic progress and ""world-class"" amenities - North Korea's authoritarian leader has been on a blitz of visits to various industrial sites and factories, often criticizing sluggish development. 
During a visit to the Myohyangsan Medical Appliances Factory in North Phyongan province northeast of the capital Pyongyang, Kim strongly condemned the lack of visible modernization at the factory, state media outlet KCNA said on Tuesday. 
Saying ""there is nothing to be proud of in the public health sector,"" Kim promised personal attention to the work of updating the factory in keeping with the goal to ""radically"" improve ""domestic production, automation and modernization,"" KCNA said. 
In another site inspection to Samjiyon, a northern county near China, Kim criticized poor workmanship on a railway to the border with China to be completed next year, calling for even roadbeds, accident-free construction and increased electricity production, according to a KCNA report on Sunday. 
After launching a number of ballistic missiles last year - including one believed to be capable of striking anywhere in the United States - Kim has since suspended his testing programs and embarked on an effort to spur economic development in his politically and economically isolated country.
North Korea argues that its move to end missile and nuclear weapons testing should be acknowledged by easing international sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council and a number of countries because of the weapons programs.
During a recent trip to Wonsan, Kim said the ongoing construction of a coastal tourist area there represented ""an acute standoff with hostile forces trying to stifle the Korean people through brigandish sanctions and blockade,"" describing the construction as ""a do-or-die struggle"" in ""such a difficult time as now,"" KCNA reported last week. 
To press North Korea to give up its nuclear and missile programs, the U.N. Security Council banned North Korea's sale of coal, iron, iron ore, lead, lead ore and seafood in a bid to slash by a third the country's $3 billion annual export incomes, while capping imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products. 

The United States, which has led the sanctions campaign, has also stepped up its own sanctions on North Korea, and says it won't ease pressure until North Korea gives up its nuclear weapons.

RABAT (Reuters) - Morocco's ministerial council on Monday approved a draft law reinstating compulsory military service for young men and women for the first time since 2006, the Royal Cabinet said in a statement.
""Female and male citizens aged between 19 and 25 years are obliged to do military service for 12 months,"" said the statement, read out by Royal Palace spokesman Abdelhak Lamrini.
The draft law, which will enter into force once it is published in the official bulletin, will set out exemptions and the rights and responsibilities of military service participants, the statement said.
""The military service aims to promote patriotism among the young, within the framework of the correlation between the rights and responsibilities of citizenship,"" it said.
Morocco has seen youth-led protests in economically marginalized areas such as the Northern Rif region and the eastern town of Jerrada in recent months. Some critics see the law as a move to encourage loyalty to the state among young people facing economic and social problems.
The ministerial council is chaired by King Mohammed, who is also the supreme commander and chief of general staff of Morocco's Royal Armed Forces.
After the council meeting, the King delivered a televised speech urging the government to do more to curb unemployment and improve the educational system and vocational training.
""We cannot let our education system continue to produce unemployed people, especially in certain branches of study, where graduates - as everyone knows - find it extremely hard to access the job market,"" he said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull survived a leadership challenge by Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton on Tuesday, a government official said, which came after weeks of speculation and falling opinion poll ratings.
Turnbull won the vote for the leadership of the Liberal Party, the senior party in the center-right government coalition, over Dutton by 48 votes to 35, chief government whip Nola Marino told reporters.
Turnbull declared the leadership of the government open earlier on Tuesday amid a backbench uprising as opinion polls showed the government on course for a heavy defeat by the opposition Labor party in an election due next year.
Turnbull's position remains in jeopardy despite surviving Dutton's leadership challenge.
""We've seen it so often in Australian politics - this two-stage act play in removing a prime minister - and, given how close the vote was, there's definitely more to come,"" said Haydon Manning, a political science professor at Flinders University in South Australia state.

Dutton, a conservative who has won the support of the powerful right wing of the Liberal Party, resigned from the Cabinet after losing the vote, Sky News reported.

983,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2018 07:47PM ET</span>","As food crisis threatens, humanitarian aid for North Korea grinds to a halt","By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - Humanitarian aid for North Korea has nearly ground to a halt this year as the United States steps up the enforcement of sanctions, despite warnings of a potential food crisis and improving relations with Pyongyang, aid groups say.
International sanctions imposed over North Korea's nuclear weapons programs technically do not cover humanitarian activities, and the United Nations recently adopted a U.S. proposal designed to streamline approval for aid shipments.
But strict interpretations of U.N. sanctions curtailing banking and shipping transactions with Pyongyang, as well as a travel ban for U.S. citizens, have effectively shut down the North Korea operations of most relief groups, according to a dozen officials at U.N. agencies and civilian organizations.
A ban on the shipment of any metal objects, from health diagnostic instruments to spoons to nail clippers, makes it nearly impossible to deliver even basic healthcare to North Korea, the officials say. Farm machines, greenhouses and ambulances, meanwhile, are sitting idle without spare parts. 
For graphic on humanitarian aid to North Korea click https://tmsnrt.rs/2nLO2fy
""The sanctions regime is having unintended consequences on humanitarian operations and relief and assistance activities, notably the collapse of the banking channel and delays in moving supplies into the country,"" Mazen Gharzeddine, who oversees North Korea operations at the United Nations Development Programme, told Reuters.
Total funding for U.N. and NGO activities in North Korea has dropped from $117.8 million in 2012 to $17.1 million so far this year, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs' Financial Tracking Service. 
The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), a Philadelphia-based NGO that has run farming projects in North Korea for 20 years, said it had halted its programs this year for the first time because of the inability to ship supplies or travel to the country.
London-headquartered Save the Children, which provided food, healthcare and disaster relief, pulled out in November citing operational obstacles.
Geneva-based Global Fund, which had funnelled more than $105 million since 2010 to fight tuberculosis and malaria, closed its North Korea operations in June. It blamed risks in deploying resources and the lack of access and oversight for the withdrawal.
While exemptions are allowed for humanitarian aid, officials say they have faced delays of more than a year for even basic aid deliveries, as well as months waiting for U.S. government permission to travel to North Korea.
That is hurting efforts to help ordinary citizens in a country where some 40 percent of the population - or more than 10 million people - need humanitarian assistance and about 20 percent of children suffer from malnutrition, according to U.N. estimates. 
SANCTIONS, DROUGHT HIT ECONOMY
This month, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said North Korea faces a ""full-blown food security crisis"" after state media warned of an ""unprecedented natural disaster"" due to the heat wave.
Another U.S. relief group, which requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue, said it worried the heatwave could lead to crop damage and loss of life. 
However, U.N. agencies and AFSC said it was too early to forecast any impact of the heatwave until the autumn harvest season, and satellite images show crops appear healthy compared to last year. 
North Korea experienced a crippling famine in the 1990s when a combination of bad weather, economic mismanagement and the removal of fuel subsidies paralyzed its state-run rationing system, killing up to three million people.
North Korea’s economy contracted by 3.5 percent in 2017, the sharpest rate since the 1990s famine, as international sanctions and drought hit growth hard, South Korea’s central bank said last month.
When asked about sanctions' impact on aid, a State Department spokesperson told Reuters sanctions will continue ""until nukes are no longer a factor,"" without elaborating.
U.S. President Donald Trump held an unprecedented summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June in Singapore and quickly declared the country no longer posed a nuclear threat. Despite positive words since from Trump, the two countries have struggled to agree on how to end the North's weapons programs.
""We are dismayed that, just as there is a thaw in U.S.-DPRK relations, the U.S. government is doubling down on sanctions, effectively shutting down the work of U.S. NGOs working on the ground,"" said Linda Lewis, who runs AFSC's agricultural projects there. The DPRK stands for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the North's official name.
Lewis said when she applied for a special passport to travel to North Korea in October, it took her 10 days, but when she made a second request in May, she had to wait for 56 days.
DEATH BY A THOUSAND CUTS
Lack of transparency and restricted access have long been a hurdle for relief workers in North Korea, even before international funding dried up under Trump's ""maximum pressure"" campaign against Pyongyang's pursuit of nuclear and missile development.
Nearly 20 international civic relief groups were active as of 2010, but that number has more than halved, according to aid workers operating in North Korea. 
Only a handful of mostly American NGOs now remain, complementing the work of the WHO, the U.N. Development Programme, U.N. World Food Program and UNICEF.
The U.N. had to stop nutrition support for kindergartens in North Korea in November due to the lack of funding. Its $111 million ""2018 Needs and Priorities Plan"" is nearly 90 percent under-funded.
After visiting North Korea last month, U.N. humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock said sanctions are exacerbating humanitarian problems. There was ""very clear evidence"" of aid needs, but funding was falling short, he added. 
Seoul has not yet delivered on its pledge made last September to give $8 million to the WFP and UNICEF to support North Korean children and pregnant women.
South Korea will make a donation ""at an appropriate time considering overall circumstances"", Unification Ministry spokeswoman Lee Eugene said.
Early this month, a U.N. panel that monitors sanctions against North Korea adopted U.S.-backed guidelines designed to facilitate humanitarian assistance to North Korea.
But aid officials say the rules still leave plenty of ambiguity. 
For example, one U.S. NGO pointed to a provision that ""strongly recommends"" shipments be consolidated into one every six months, which it said was unfeasible for many groups.
""If the true intention is not to harm humanitarian efforts, then there should be more will and commitment on the part of every government ... to make sure that humanitarian efforts go forth unimpeded,"" an official at the agency said, requesting anonymity due to sensitivity of the matter.
""Truly, for humanitarian organizations, it is death by a thousand cuts.""

984,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2018 07:32PM ET</span>",Two arrested for allegedly spying for Iran in U.S.,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two Iranian men were indicted on Monday for allegedly spying for Tehran in the United States, including conducting surveillance at a Jewish facility and gathering information on backers of the militant Iranian opposition Mujahideen-e Khalq, the Justice Department said.
Ahmadreza Mohammadi-Doostdar, 38, a dual U.S.-Iranian citizen, and Majid Ghorbani, 59, an Iranian citizen and resident of California, were charged in the indictment with acting on behalf of Iran by conducting the surveillance, the Justice Department said in a statement. Both were arrested on Aug. 9.
The indictment alleges Doostdar traveled from Iran to the United States in July 2017 to collect intelligence about entities considered to be enemies of the Iranian government, including Israeli and Jewish interests as well as people associated with MEK, it said.
The Justice Department said Doostdar conducted surveillance in July 2017 of an ultraorthodox Jewish facility in Chicago, the Rohr Chabad House, including photographing the security features.
Ghorbani attended an MEK rally in New York on Sept. 20, 2017, to protest the current Iranian government, taking photographs of the participants, which he later passed on to Doostdar and was paid about $2,000.
The photos, many with handwritten notes about the participants, were found in Ghorbani's luggage at a U.S. airport as he was returning to Iran in December 2017, the Justice Department said.
Ghorbani also attended an MEK-affiliated Iran Freedom Convention for Human Rights in Washington in May, where he again appeared to photograph speakers and attendees, the department said. He later spoke with Doostdar to discuss clandestine methods to deliver the information to Iran, it said.
Iran considers the Mujahideen-e Khalq to be a terrorist group that seeks the overthrow of the government in Tehran. The group was listed as a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department until 2012.

ROME (Reuters) - At least 10 people were killed in southern Italy on Monday when they were hurled over rocks by a raging white-water creek in a deep mountain gorge that swelled suddenly after heavy rainfall upstream, officials said.
The civil protection department said 18 people were rescued and six of those were injured in the flash rush of water in the Calabria region.
It was not clear how many people were missing because not all had entered the gorge with official guides and registered. Spotlights were brought to the area so the search could continue during the night.
The nationalities of the dead and injured were not immediately known. Most tourists and trekkers who visit the area, in the country's deep south, are Italian.
In some places the Raganello creek, part of the Pollino National Park, is at the bottom of a narrow, one-kilometer(0.8-mile)-deep gorge in the mountain. Rescue teams used ropes to descend the sides of the mountain to reach the site.
""This gorge filled up with water in a really short space of time and these people were catapulted out like bullets. They ended up some three kilometers (two miles) down the valley,"" said Carlo Tansi, head of the civil protection department in Calabria.
""It is really difficult terrain, filled with obstacles because of the (geological) formation of the area,"" said Eugenio Facciolla, the chief prosecutor of the provincial capital, Cosenza.
He said rescuers working under spotlights were trying to locate areas where some people may have survived by ending up on small patches of shore or tiny islands in the creek.
Helmeted mountain rescue squads rushed from the nearest town of Civita to reach the gorge, a popular tourist attraction in summer.
The most seriously injured were taken by helicopter to hospitals in Cosenza.

Last week, a motorway bridge collapsed in the northern Italian port city of Genoa, killing 43 people.

988,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2018 06:35PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Trump vows 'no concessions' with Turkey over detained U.S. pastor,"By Steve Holland, Jeff Mason and James Oliphant
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday ruled out agreeing to any demands from Turkey to gain the release of a detained American pastor and said he was not concerned that his tough stance could end up hurting European and emerging market economies.
In a wide-ranging Oval Office interview with Reuters, Trump complained about interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and suggested he was having second thoughts about Jerome Powell, his choice for Fed chair. He also said he ""most likely"" will have a second meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and indicated he would consider lifting U.S. sanctions on Russia if Moscow took some actions in return. 
Trump said he thought he had a deal with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan when he helped persuade Israel to free a detained Turkish citizen. He had thought Erdogan would then release pastor Andrew Brunson, who denies Turkey's allegations that he was involved in a plot against Erdogan two years ago.
""I think it's very sad what Turkey is doing. I think they're making a terrible mistake. There will be no concessions,"" he said.
Turkey has demanded that the United States hand over Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric in the United States suspected in the coup plot against Erdogan, but the United States has balked at this.
Trump has imposed tariffs on imports of Turkish steel and aluminum in response to Erdogan's refusal to free Brunson, raising concerns of economic damage in Europe and in emerging market economies.
""I'm not concerned at all. I’m not concerned. This is the proper thing to do,"" he said, when asked about the potential damage to other economies.
Trump said Erdogan had wanted the Turkish citizen returned from Israel.
Trump and Erdogan met in Brussels for a NATO summit in mid-July where they discussed Brunson’s case and what could be the way forward to release the pastor, a senior White House official said earlier.
Turkey had sought U.S. help to persuade the Israelis to release a Turkish woman who was being held in Israel, the senior official said. In exchange Turkey would release Brunson and other Americans being held in Turkey.
Trump said he kept his side of the bargain.
""I got that person out for him. I expect him to let this very innocent and wonderful man and great father and great Christian out of Turkey,"" Trump said.
The dispute threatens to intensify a split between the United States and Turkey, a key NATO ally that plans to buy Russian missiles.
Israel, which confirmed that Trump had requested Ebru Ozkan’s release, deported her on July 15. Ankara has denied ever agreeing to free Brunson in return.
Trump added: ""I like Turkey. I like the people of Turkey very much. Until now I had a very good relationship as you know with the president. I got along with him great. I had a very good relationship. But it can’t be a one-way street. It’s no longer a one-way street for the United States."" 
PUTIN, TRUMP MEETING
Trump drew a barrage of criticism at home and abroad after he stood side by side with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a July 16 summit in Helsinki and cast doubt on his own intelligence agencies' findings that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. elections.
In the Reuters interview, he ticked off areas that he discussed privately with Putin, including security for Israel, Syria and Russia's annexation of Crimea and incursion into eastern Ukraine, and the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany that will supply natural gas to Germany.
Trump said Putin did not raise with him the issue of U.S. sanctions on Russia but that he would consider lifting them if Russia took steps on such areas as Syria or Ukraine.
""I would consider it if they do something that would be good for us. But I wouldn’t consider it without that,"" he said.
Turning to Iran, Trump showed little interest in meeting Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to discuss the dispute over Iran's nuclear program after earlier this month expressing a willingness to do so.
The Iranians, including Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, have dismissed the offer. Trump said it did not matter to him whether he met Iran's leaders and that there had been no U.S. outreach toward Iran to discuss talks.
Trump's withdrawal of the United States from the nuclear deal between Iran and world powers earlier this year has raised tensions between Washington and Tehran.
""If they want to meet that’s fine, and if they don’t want to meet, I couldn’t care less,"" he said.
Trump cast doubt on whether he will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping during an international Asia-Pacific summit in Papua New Guinea in November. Trump again talked up the warmth of his relationship with Xi, but said little progress has been made on his drive to rebalance the U.S.-Chinese trade relationship.
""Maybe. I’m not sure that it’s been set up yet. We’ll see,"" he said, when asked about a possible meeting with Xi.
He also said he had ""no time frame"" for resolving his administration's trade dispute with China.

""I'm like them, I have a long horizon,"" he said.

990,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2018 06:01PM ET</span>","Some Venezuelans, alarmed by Maduro's measures, speed up plans to flee","By Shaylim Castro and Mircely Guanipa
CARACAS/PUNTO FIJO, Venezuela (Reuters) - Carpenter Jose Narvaez had planned to flee Venezuela and emigrate to the nearby Caribbean island of Aruba toward the end of the year, until Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro unveiled his plan to turn around the crumbling economy. 
Now the 43-year-old Narvaez wants to leave as fast as he can.
Maduro on Friday stunned the South American nation by announcing a 96 percent devaluation and vowing to peg the bolivar currency to Venezuela's new 'petro', a cryptocurrency that experts have cast doubt on as a functional financial instrument. 
""I am looking for flights to leave on Wednesday, any way I can,"" Narvaez said in Venezuela's western oil hub of Punto Fijo, home to massive but deteriorated oil refineries. ""I am sure this is going to get worse because the man's ideas lack all logic."" 
Maduro, who argues that he is the victim of a Washington-led ""economic war"" designed to sabotage his administration through sanctions, said that using the petro will abolish the ""tyranny"" of the dollar and lead to an economic rebirth in Venezuela, an OPEC member state home to the world's biggest crude oil reserves.
But many Venezuelans fear the measures - whose details have not been explained - could render the country even more anarchic, and say they will join the exodus. 
As the once-wealthy nation has slid into poverty, hundreds of thousands have already decided to leave. 
With the International Monetary Fund forecasting that inflation could reach 1 million percent by the year's end, malnutrition is on the rise, as a monthly minimum wage that amounts to a few U.S. dollars puts simple products like chicken out of reach for many. Families forage through garbage, parents skip meals to let their children eat, and adolescents clamber up trees to pluck mangoes.
The United Nations estimates around 2.3 million Venezuelans now live abroad - with 1.6 million having fled in the last two and half years alone, the biggest movement of people in Latin America's modern history. 
That contrasts sharply with the twentieth century, when a booming Venezuela accepted immigrants from southern Europe, the Middle East, and neighboring war-torn Colombia. 
In the capital Caracas, streets were quiet on Monday. Maduro had decreed a national holiday for the first day of a plan that will slash five zeros from prices in a bid to tame hyperinflation, as part of his economic package.
Information technology worker Keila Leiba said she had planned to emigrate to Mexico by early 2019 but Maduro's announcements had led her to bring forward her plans. 
""I'm thinking short-term now. I may change my plans to leave within a month or a month-and-a-half,"" said Leiba, as she queued to submit paperwork for a coveted Spanish passport.
""I don't see any opportunities here, nothing. You work, work, work, and ... you don't have access to the most important thing: Food.""
TURNING TIDE IN SOUTH AMERICA 
Many Latin American governments initially welcomed the migrants with open arms, remembering Venezuela's role in welcoming those fleeing dictatorships and conflict in the past.
But the exodus has ballooned this year, stretching social services, creating more competition for low-skilled jobs, and stoking fears of crime. The sight of Venezuelans begging on street corners in cities such as Colombian capital Bogota and Ecuador's Quito is becoming increasingly common.
In the last week, both Ecuador and Peru have announced tighter entry requirements for Venezuelans, while in Brazil rioting locals drove hundreds of migrants back over the border. 
Speaking in a plaza in Caracas, sports teacher Maritza Hernandez, 60, said: ""We accepted everyone here. They should give us an opportunity."" 
One of her sons is in Chile; the other plans to emigrate there at the end of this year. Hernandez said she was hoping to follow suit in 2019. 
For many in Venezuela, the issue is now how to afford a move. 
""If it just depended on me, I would leave today,"" said restaurant worker Aries Armas, 21, who said she did not have enough money. 

""The influx of Venezuelans must be affecting countries, but if you want to leave now: where can you go?""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The former leader of Mexico's influential teachers union made a combative comeback to public life on Monday after being let off corruption charges, by attacking the outgoing government in a speech and claiming its education reform had failed.
Long accused by critics of corruption, Elba Esther Gordillo was a powerful force in Mexican politics before her arrest in 2013, a day after President Enrique Pena Nieto signed into law a major education reform that she had opposed.
Earlier this month, a judge dismissed charges of money laundering and organized crime against Gordillo.
In a defiant speech to a hall packed with supporters, Gordillo described herself as the innocent victim of a political witch-hunt, and blasted Pena Nieto's attempt to shake up the education system.
""I have won my freedom again, and the education reform has been brought down,"" Gordillo told the news conference.
Pena Nieto faced resistance from teachers in implementing the reform, and his successor, President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, pledged to scrap the legislation in the campaign leading up to his landslide victory on July 1.
Gordillo's grandson, Rene Fujiwara, left the teachers' union's PANAL political party early this year to support Lopez Obrador's bid for the presidency.
Making her first public appearance since her arrest, Gordillo said she had been the target of ""political persecution"" that was used to tarnish the union.
At a news conference with Lopez Obrador later on Monday, Pena Nieto dismissed the notion Gordillo had been targeted for political ends.
Lopez Obrador, who following her arrest in 2013 had called Gordillo and Pena Nieto ""equally corrupt"", said little on her case save that the judge's decision should be respected. 
Repeating his promise to ""cancel"" the education reform, Lopez Obrador said the 73-year-old Gordillo would not serve in his government.
Hundreds of members of the National Union of Education Workers (SNTE), one of the largest in Latin America with over 1.5 million members, crowded into one of the salons of the hotel in Mexico City where Gordillo delivered her speech.
""My loyalty and my place has always been, and always will be, alongside the teachers of Mexico, and the defense of public education,"" Gordillo said.
Gordillo led the teachers union for years and belonged to Pena Nieto's long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, until breaking with the party over a decade ago.

Mexico ranks last in education standards among the 35 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he would ""most likely"" meet again with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, while defending his efforts to convince Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons.
In an interview with Reuters, Trump, who held a landmark summit with Kim on June 12, said he believed North Korea had taken specific steps toward denuclearization, despite widespread doubts about Kim's willingness to abandon his arsenal.
While insisting that ""a lot of good things are happening"" with North Korea, Trump complained that China was not helping as much as it had in the past because of its trade dispute with the United States.
Trump, who faced the North Korean challenge as soon as he took office in January 2017, said he had only been working on the North Korean issue for three months whereas his predecessors had been working on it for 30 years.
""I stopped (North Korea's) nuclear testing. I stopped (North Korea's) missile testing. Japan is thrilled. What's going to happen? Who knows? We're going to see,"" he said. 
At their summit in Singapore, Kim agreed in broad terms to work toward denuclearization of the Korean peninsula but North Korea has given no indication it is willing to give up its weapons unilaterally as the Trump administration has demanded.
Trump has hailed the Singapore summit as a success and went as far as saying North Korea no longer posed a nuclear threat.
In the interview, Trump credited his ""great chemistry"" with Kim for easing a nuclear standoff that last year raised fears of a new Korean war.
""I like him. He likes me,"" he said. ""There's no ballistic missiles going up, there's a lot of silence ... I have very good personal relations with Chairman Kim, and I think that's what holds it together.""
Asked whether another meeting with Kim was on the horizon, Trump said: ""It's most likely we will, but I just don't want to comment."" But he offered no details on the timing or venue.
Critics say Trump made too many concessions to Kim by agreeing to hold the summit in the first place and then suspending joint U.S.-South Korea military drills while gaining little in return.
Asked whether North Korea had taken specific steps to denuclearize other than blowing up its main nuclear bomb test site ahead of the summit, Trump: ""I do believe they have."" But he did not elaborate.

He also pointed to North Korea's pre-summit handover of three American detainees.

MUZDALIFA, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - More than 2 million Muslims gathered at Mount Arafat on Monday for a vigil to atone for their sins, and then descended to Muzdalifa to prepare for the final stages of the annual haj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia.
Clad in white robes signifying a state of purity, the pilgrims spent the previous night in an encampment around the hill where Islam holds that God tested Abraham's faith by commanding him to sacrifice his son Ismail and Prophet Mohammad gave his final sermon.
Other worshippers praying in the nearby Mina area ascended in buses or on foot from before dawn as security forces directed traffic and helicopters and surveillance drones hovered overhead.
Some of the faithful carried umbrellas to block the sun as daytime temperatures surpassed 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) following an evening of thunderstorms and high winds. Men and women from 165 countries gathered side by side, while soldiers handed out bottled water and some people snapped selfies.
Pakistani pilgrim Mohamed Forqan, 30, said it was a great day to be a Muslim. ""Here in Arafat we feel that we are born today asking Allah to forgive our sins,"" he said.
Hilal Issa, 70, from Algeria, said he was praying for God to pardon all Muslims and save the Arab world from its afflictions.
For a graphic on The haj journey http://tmsnrt.rs/2imJ2yf
Saudi Arabia has said more than 2.37 million pilgrims, mostly from outside Saudi Arabia, had arrived for the five-day ritual, a religious duty once in a lifetime for every able-bodied Muslim who can afford the journey.
After sunset, they moved on foot, by bus and in trains to the rocky plain of Muzdalifa to gather pebbles to throw at stone columns symbolizing the devil at another location called Jamarat on Tuesday, which marks the first day of Eid al-Adha, or the feast of sacrifice.
""I feel at ease after standing at Arafat. This is a rite that one waits an entire life for,"" said Ashraf Abdelrahman, 46. ""I feel that I will return to Sudan like the day I was born.""
CALLS FOR UNITY
In a haj message, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, leader of Saudi rival Iran, called for unity among Muslims as a defense against foreign enemies.
""Muslims should be vigilant about America’s malicious war-mongering policy aimed at Muslims killing Muslims,"" he said in comments read by a representative on Iranian television.
The United States reimposed economic sanctions on Iran this month after pulling out of a 2015 international deal aimed at curbing its nuclear program in return for easing sanctions.
Washington has said Tehran's only chance of avoiding the sanctions would be to accept President Donald Trump's offer to negotiate for a tougher nuclear deal, which Iranian officials have rejected.
Iranian television showed a handful of Iranian pilgrims carrying banners and chanting slogans against the United States and Israel.
In a midday sermon, senior Saudi cleric Sheikh Hussein bin Abdulaziz Al al-Sheikh also urged pilgrims to come together with their co-religionists but cautioned: ""Haj is not a place for slogans and parties.""
Mecca Governor Prince Khalid al-Faisal said there were some 86,000 Iranian pilgrims this year and around 300 from Qatar, which is locked in a year-old diplomatic row with Saudi Arabia over alleged support for terrorism, which Qatar denies.
Saudi Arabia stakes its reputation on its guardianship of Islam's holiest sites - Mecca and Medina - and organizing the pilgrimage.
The world's largest annual gathering of Muslims has in the past seen stampedes, fires and riots, with authorities sometimes struggling to respond. A crush in 2015 killed nearly 800 pilgrims, according to Riyadh, although counts by countries of repatriated bodies showed over 2,000 may have died, more than 400 of them Iranians.
Officials say they have taken all necessary precautions this year, with tens of thousands of security forces and health workers on hand to maintain safety and provide first aid.
Pilgrimage is also the backbone of a plan to expand tourism under a drive to diversify the kingdom's economy away from oil. The haj and year-round umrah generate billions of dollars in revenue from worshippers' lodging, transport, fees and gifts.

The authorities aim to increase the number of umrah and haj pilgrims to 15 million and 5 million respectively by 2020, and hope to double the umrah number again to 30 million by 2030.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis, facing sexual abuse crises in several countries, wrote an unprecedented letter to all Catholics on Monday, asking each one of them to help root out ""this culture of death"" and vowing there would be no more cover ups.
In a highly personal letter addressed to ""the people of God,"" Church language for all members, the pope appeared to be launching an appeal for all Catholics to face the crisis together and not let it tear the Church apart.
The Catholic Church in the United States, Chile, Australia, and Ireland - where the pope is making a two-day visit this weekend - are reeling from crises involving sexual abuse of minors. Numerous surveys have pointed to plummeting confidence in the Church in those countries and elsewhere.
In his letter, the pope referred to the suffering endured by minors due to sexual abuse at the hands of a ""significant number of clerics and consecrated persons.""
The Vatican said it was the first time a pope had written to all of the world's some 1.2 billion Catholics about sexual abuse. Past letters on sexual abuse scandals have been addressed to bishops and faithful of individual countries.
""We have realized that these wounds never disappear and that they require us forcefully to condemn these atrocities and join forces in uprooting this culture of death,"" he said.
Quoting a Gospel passage that says ""If one member suffers, all suffer together,"" Francis added:
""(Those words) forcefully echo in my heart as I acknowledge once more the suffering endured by many minors due to sexual abuse, the abuse of power and the abuse of conscience perpetrated by a significant number of clerics and consecrated persons.""
""With shame and repentance, we acknowledge as an ecclesial community that we were not where we should have been, that we did not act in a timely manner, realizing the magnitude and the gravity of the damage done to so many lives. We showed no care for the little ones; we abandoned them,"" Francis wrote.
Advocates for victims of clergy sexual abuse expressed disappointment. ""More actions, less words,"" said Anne Barrett-Doyle, co-director of BishopAccountability.org, a U.S.-based resource center that tracks cases of clerical abuse worldwide.
""He needs an effective discipline process for bishops and religious superiors who are known to have enabled abuse,"" she said.
Last week a grand jury in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania released the findings of the largest-ever investigation of sex abuse in the U.S. Catholic Church, finding that 301 priests in the state had sexually abused minors over the past 70 years.
CRYING OUT TO HEAVEN
He acknowledged that ""the heart-wrenching pain of these victims, which cries out to heaven, was long ignored, kept quiet or silenced"".
""Looking ahead to the future, no effort must be spared to create a culture able to prevent such situations from happening, but also to prevent the possibility of their being covered up and perpetuated,"" he said.
He also acknowledged that the implementation of a zero tolerance had been ""delayed"" in some places.
Victims groups have said that while new policies have been put into place in several countries to alert civil authorities about cases of abuse, the pope still needed to do more to hold accountable bishops who covered it up, mostly by moving priests from parish to parish.
In his first direct response to the U.S. grand jury report, Francis said that while most cases it listed ""belong to the past,"" it was clear that the abuse cited ""was long ignored, kept quiet or silenced"".
Last month, Theodore McCarrick, the former archbishop of Washington, D.C., and one of the U.S. Church's most prominent figures, stepped down as a cardinal after accusations that he abused two minors about 50 years ago and later abused adult seminarians.
He was believed to be the first cardinal to lose his red hat in nearly a century and the first ever for alleged sexual abuse.

In May, all 34 of Chile's bishops offered their resignation to the pope over a widening sexual abuse crisis there. He has so far accepted five of the resignations.

The army said the early-morning raids took place in the Alemão and Maré slums and the neighborhood of Penha, an area home to more than half a million people and some of Rio's most violent areas, which have been targeted in a divisive six-month federal security operation. 
Initially, the army had reported eight people were killed. 
""The operations are ongoing and there could be more deaths,"" the army said in an email to Reuters. 
Many people shut themselves inside their homes for fear of being shot if they went outside, the Globo TV website reported.
Separately, at least six suspected gangsters were killed on Monday near a bridge linking Rio and the neighboring city of Niteroi, police said. Four people died in the shootout with police, while two more died in hospital.
The joint army and police operations, which the army said were intended to flush out drug dealers, involved 4,200 soldiers and 70 police officers, as well as armored vehicles and aircraft.
The soldier who died on Monday was the first to be killed since the intervention began, the state security ministry said.
Just over six months ago, President Michel Temer announced emergency measures authorizing the army to take command of police forces in Rio de Janeiro state, where warring drug gangs and militias have triggered a sharp rise in violence.
Since the operation began, both murders and the number of people killed in police confrontations have risen, casting doubts on a strategy criticized for relying on military tactics, a lack of transparency and unclear goals.

Nearly 64,000 people were murdered in Brazil in 2017, a record high, and the rise in violence has become a key issue ahead of presidential elections in October. Candidates across the political spectrum are trying to play up their crime-fighting credentials and appeal to an electorate fed up with a weak economy and endemic graft.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - The government of the northern Brazilian state of Roraima on Monday asked the country's supreme court to halt the entry of Venezuelan immigrants, increasing pressure on the federal government to resolve a growing regional crisis.
Roraima's request followed a weekend of violence in the state, where tens of thousands of Venezuelans have arrived in recent years, fleeing economic and political turmoil in their country.
""As a result of the grave conflicts over the weekend, the state of Roraima submitted a fastrack request ... seeking the temporary suspension of Venezuelan immigration through the border,"" the state government said in a statement. 
The supreme court rejected a previous request by Roraima, as the Brazilian constitution mandates an open border. 
The court is unlikely to agree to the new request.
Still, local tensions have been mounting in the growing Latin American crisis, with countries across the region taking a tougher line against fleeing Venezuelans.
For instance, Venezuelans entering Ecuador and Peru will soon be required to show hard-to-get passports, rather than the more ubiquitous national identity cards, governments of both countries announced last week.
This weekend in the Roraima border city of Pacaraima, four people beat a shop owner and some locals said the assailants were Venezuelans, which prompted a mob to destroy the tents of immigrants camped in the streets and set fire to the belongings they left behind. Some 1,200 Venezuelans retreated back over the border, local officials said.
President Michel Temer on Sunday announced an increase from 31 to 151 in the contingent of soldiers helping keep order at the border, while also pledging to speed the relocation of Venezuelan immigrants to other Brazilian states. Temer has repeatedly refused to close the border.
""The closure of the border is unthinkable because it is illegal,"" Sergio Etchegoyen, Brazil's minister of institutional security, said on Monday. 
He added that soldiers were now patrolling the border, and that the situation had improved.
""There's tension, but there's no conflict,"" he said.
Angered by a perceived lack of federal support to deal with the migration crisis, Roraima has repeatedly turned to the courts, hoping judges will force Brasilia's hand. 

Earlier in August, a federal judge in Roraima ordered the border closed until the state could create ""humanitarian"" conditions to receive Venezuelans, but the decision was soon overturned by a federal appeals court judge.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy will let its coast guard ship carrying 177 migrants it rescued on the high seas five days ago dock in Sicily, Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli said on Monday, ending a standoff with Malta over where it should disembark.
The European Commission also said it was working on a solution to share out of the migrants aboard the Diciotti with Italy's EU partners after a request from Italy's foreign ministry the previous day. 
""The Diciotti ship will dock in Catania,"" Toninelli said on Twitter without specifying when. ""Now Europe must hurry to do its part."" 
Since taking office in June, Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Salvini and Toninelli have toughened the stance on allowing ships to dock in the country's ports at a time of rising anti-immigration sentiment in Italy.
The Diciotti picked up 190 migrants on Wednesday from an overcrowded boat.
The coast guard quickly evacuated 13 of them to Italy for emergency medical treatment, but instead of bringing the rest to shore, the Diciotti stayed in international waters while Rome insisted that Malta should take them since the migrant boat had first passed through its search-and-rescue area. 
But Malta said the migrants had refused its aid because they wanted to reach Italy. On Sunday, Toninelli said the small island nation should be sanctioned for not performing the rescue.
After more than 650,000 arrivals on Italian shores since 2014, Salvini has repeatedly said the country ""will no longer be Europe's refugee camp"", calling on EU partners to share the burden of the arrivals.
Flows across the Mediterranean from Libya to Italy - one of the main routes to Europe - have tapered off as Libyan factions cracked down on people smugglers, and as the EU bolstered its support for the Libyan coast guard.
But people are still dying at sea and summer is peak season for migrants attempting the crossing, often in overcrowded, unseaworthy boats.

Brussels said it was in talks with European Union states on who will take the Diciotti people in but declined comment on which capitals or when could offer help.

China, which claims Taiwan as its territory, has ramped up military and diplomatic pressure in an attempt to assert Chinese sovereignty over the island, even as the U.S. government makes fresh overtures to it.
In March, U.S. President Donald Trump signed the Taiwan Travel Act -- a non-binding bill encouraging the United States to send senior officials to Taiwan to meet Taiwanese counterparts. 
While Tsai was not invited to the United States for an official visit, she met U.S. senators while she was there, attended banquets with overseas Taiwanese and spoke of the need for strong ties with Washington.
The number of countries that now officially recognize Taiwan has been whittled down to 18, following moves by Burkina Faso in West Africa and the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean region to formally switch relations to China from Taiwan this year. 
""Taiwan would not bow to pressure. Pressure would only make us more determined and united. It would only boost our determination to go abroad,"" Tsai said at Taiwan's international airport upon arrival late on Monday after the nine-day trip. She did not elaborate. 
Tsai said during talks with heads of state during the trip, she had ""demonstrated Taiwan's determination for the value of freedom and democracy."" 
China, which believes Tsai wants to push for Taiwan's formal independence, has already complained to Washington about her U.S. stopovers on the arrival and departure legs of her trip to Paraguay and Belize in the past two weekends.
Democratic Taiwan is one of China's most sensitive territorial issues and Tsai's U.S. stopovers in the United States, a customary practice for Taiwanese presidents, came amid an increasingly bitter trade war between Beijing and Washington.
While the United States has no formal ties with Taiwan, it is its main supplier of arms and military hardware, and its strongest unofficial diplomatic backer.
In a sign of the geo-political tensions, a Taiwan bakery chain with numerous branches in China disappeared from major Chinese food apps amid calls for a boycott after Tsai stopped by for a coffee at one of its stores in Los Angeles
In response, Tsai last week urged people in Taiwan to remain united and she remained defiant in the face of Beijing's pressure. 
""My administration will continue strengthening every aspect of #Taiwan-#US relations. Until next time!"" Tsai tweeted upon her departure from a U.S. airport earlier on Monday, along with a photo of her holding hands with James F. Moriarty, chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan.

ARAFAT, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Muslims at the annual haj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia criticized what they described as discordant Arab leaders for failing to block President Donald Trump's decision to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem after he recognized the city as Israel's capital.
It was a reversal of decades of American policy and the embassy opened in May at a high-profile ceremony attended by Trump's daughter Ivanka and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, the U.S. envoy to the Middle East.
The status of Jerusalem - home to sites holy to the Muslim, Jewish and Christian religions - is one of the biggest obstacles to any peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The United Nations says the status of the ancient city - whose eastern sector was captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war - can only be resolved by negotiations. Palestinians claim East Jerusalem for the capital of an independent state they seek. Israel says Jerusalem is its eternal and indivisible capital.
""This happened with the complicity of the Arab leaders,"" 53-year-old Saad Awad from Sudan said on Monday as he walked east of Mecca with more than 2 million fellow Muslims from around the world.
""If the Arab leaders were united and adhering to the Koran and the Sunna (Islamic practice based on words and deeds of the Prophet), it would be impossible for the Americans or anyone else to do something like this.""
Saudi Arabia, which stakes its reputation on its guardianship of Islam's holiest sites - Mecca and Medina - and organizing the haj, has urged pilgrims to put aside political concerns and focus on spirituality.
The five-day ritual, the world's largest annual gathering of Muslims, is a religious duty once in a lifetime for every able-bodied adherent who can afford it.

Few pilgrims openly censured the host country, but dismay among ordinary Arabs at the embassy move has been tinged with anger at regional governments - particularly those of the oil-rich Gulf monarchies - for failing to stop, or even strongly protest against, Trump's decision last December.
""The Arabs are weak and have not taken a stand on the issue of Jerusalem,"" said Algerian pilgrim Hilal Issa, 70.
Some critics accuse Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, of surrendering Palestinian rights for the sake of its alliance with Trump and his tough stand on Iran.
While Saudi Arabia and its fellow monarchies have previously criticized the embassy decision, they have also welcomed Trump's harder line against Iran, which has cast itself as the guardian of Palestinian rights.
In recent years the bitter regional rivalry that pits Shi'ite Muslim Iran and its allies against a bloc led by Sunni Muslim-majority Saudi Arabia has increasingly pushed the decades-old Arab-Israeli struggle into the background.
King Salman has reassured Arab allies Riyadh would not endorse any peace plan that fails to address Jerusalem's status or other key issues, Reuters reported last month, easing concerns that the kingdom might back a nascent U.S. deal which largely aligns with Israel.

""If the Arabs were united, nobody would have dared make such a move,"" Yemeni pilgrim Amr Ahmed Ali said of the embassy transfer. ""But God willing, the Arabs will unite, and this city will unite the Arabs and Muslims behind one cause which is the Palestinian cause.""

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Jailed former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has increased his support by 5 percentage points and would win Brazil's October presidential election if he was allowed to run, a poll by CNT/MDA showed on Monday.
The survey, which was last taken in May, found that almost half of the leftist leader's supporters would transfer their votes to his running mate Fernando Haddad if Lula is disqualified from Brazil's most uncertain race in decades.
The Brazilian real led losses among Latin American currencies after the poll showed investors' favorite Geraldo Alckmin, the candidate most likely to enact fiscal reforms, lagging far behind his rivals.
Electoral authorities are expected to bar Lula from the election due to a corruption conviction. Despite that, he took 37.3 percent of voter intentions in the latest poll, up from 32.4 percent in the same poll in May.
His nearest rival was far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro with 18.3 percent, followed by environmentalist Marina Silva with 5.6 percent and business-friendly Alckmin with 4.9 percent.
Support for Marina Silva and center-left candidate Ciro Gomes has slipped since the May poll, while support increased for Bolsonaro. Alckmin, a former governor of Sao Paulo state, has also gained ground marginally.
It was the first major poll since candidacies were officially registered last week, but it did not provide results for the likely scenario of a race without Lula.
Lula's supporters were asked who they would back if he is out of the race and 17.3 percent of the people surveyed said they would cast their vote for Haddad, a former Sao Paulo mayor who would head the Workers Party ticket.
Another 11.9 percent of the voters surveyed would migrate to Marina Silva, 9.6 percent to Gomes, 6.2 percent to Bolsonaro and 3.7 percent to Alckmin.
Lula, Brazil's first working class president and whose social policies lifted millions from poverty in Latin America's largest nation, was jailed in April to start serving a 12-year sentence for receiving bribes. 

The nationwide survey of 2,002 people was carried out by pollster MDA for the transportation sector lobby CNT between Aug. 15-18 and has a margin of error of 2.2 percentage points.

Two knife-wielding assailants tried to enter a police station in Chechnya's Shalinsky district and assaulted and wounded two police officers, Russian investigators said. Both attackers were shot dead, TASS news agency reported. 
In a separate incident in the village of Mesker-Yurt, a young man carrying a rucksack blew himself up at a police post, but did not injure anyone, investigators said. 
And in Grozny, the Chechen capital, police opened fire with automatic weapons on a driver in a Mercedes who tried to run down two traffic police officers, according to investigators. The driver was killed, they said.
Moscow has fought two wars with separatists in the mainly Muslim internal republic since the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union, but such attacks have become relatively rare in Chechnya.
The wider North Caucasus region remains volatile, however, with unemployment and corruption pushing some young men to embrace radical Islam.
Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who was on a trip to Saudi Arabia when the attacks occurred, said they were designed to overshadow the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha.

1003,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2018 11:48AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Pentagon raises alarm about sharp drop in Iraqi refugees coming to U.S.,"By Yeganeh Torbati
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Military officials are sounding the alarm inside the Trump administration about the sharp drop in admission to the United States of Iraqi refugees who have helped American troops in battle, said two U.S. officials aware of the internal discussions.
The Pentagon is concerned that not providing safe haven to more of the Iraqis, many of whom interpreted and did other key tasks for U.S. forces, will harm national security by dissuading locals from cooperating with the United States in Iraq and other conflict zones, the officials said.
In a closed-door White House meeting last week devoted to the Iraqi issue, officials focused largely on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's method of conducting certain deep background checks on the Iraqis, and identified it as a major source of the drop in admissions, said the two officials aware of the discussions, who declined to be named.
As of Aug. 15, just 48 Iraqis have been admitted to the United States this fiscal year through a special refugee program meant for people who worked for the U.S. government or American contractors, news media or non-governmental groups, according to data provided by the State Department. More than 3,000 came last year and about 5,100 in 2016.
At the meeting last week, officials examined the multiple security checks that Iraqis must pass, including one background check that all refugees undergo, called the Interagency Check.
They determined the obstacle was a separate process called Security Advisory Opinions (SAOs), which are required for a smaller subset of people - male and female refugees within a certain age range from Iraq and 10 other countries, mostly in the Middle East and Africa.
The FBI and intelligence agencies conduct the SAOs while the State Department coordinates the process.
At the meeting, the FBI revealed that of a batch of 88 Iraqis it had recently completed SAOs for, it found suspicious information on 87 of them, said the two officials aware of the meeting. Current and former officials said that is a much higher ""hit rate"" than in past years.
It was unclear to officials what exactly is causing the higher hit rate, and the meeting did not get into the details of the FBI's screening methodology and how it might have changed.
FBI spokeswoman Kelsey Pietranton declined to comment on the Iraqi refugee issue.
""ADDITIONAL VETTING""
A State Department spokeswoman said on Saturday the United States will continue to process U.S.-affiliated Iraqis for resettlement ""while prioritizing the safety and security of the American people. Additional vetting procedures are enabling departments and agencies to more thoroughly review applicants and identify potential threats to public safety and national security.""
Pentagon spokesman David Eastburn referred a request for comment on the Iraqi refugees to the White House.
A White House official did not directly comment when asked about the Iraqi refugee issue or the FBI process but said the Trump administration's approach is ""protecting the national interest, preventing foreign terrorist attacks, and protecting U.S. taxpayers and workers.”
One official said the White House meeting last week resulted directly from a smaller, higher-level meeting of senior national security officials earlier this month. They discussed the maximum number of refugees the United States will admit into the country next year. The administration must reach a decision on the ceiling by Sept. 30.
In the earlier, high-level meeting, the Pentagon and State Department both supported maintaining the admissions ceiling at 45,000, one current official and one former official informed of the discussions said. Other agencies' positions on the cap were not yet clear.
At that meeting, a senior Pentagon official raised the issue of the paltry admissions of Iraqi refugees, and asked that if the admissions ceiling is cut further from 45,000, the Iraqis be admitted without counting against the cap, one official said.
A State Department spokeswoman declined to comment on preliminary discussions. The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment on its position on the ceiling.
The White House official said the administration's deliberations over the refugee ceiling are continuing and said the United States is ""under significant strain as a result of a massive asylum crisis that is separate from, and in addition to, the refugee ceiling.""
President Donald Trump campaigned in 2016 promising tight restrictions on immigration, and in the past year and a half, his administration has sharply reduced refugee admissions through executive orders and closed-door decisions.
The refugee ceiling Trump set last year of 45,000 is the lowest since 1980, when the modern refugee program was established. The United States is on track to admit about 22,000 refugees this year, approximately half of the maximum allowed.
Advocates for Iraqis who worked for the U.S. government or American companies say hundreds of them have been killed, wounded, abducted or threatened because of their work and face continued danger inside Iraq from armed militias opposed to the United States.
""Iraqis with a U.S. affiliation currently have no avenue to safety,"" said Betsy Fisher, policy director for the International Refugee Assistance Project. 
STRICTER VETTING
Last year, the Trump administration instituted more stringent screening for refugees, including a requirement that they submit phone numbers and email addresses for many more family members than before. That information is now assessed in the SAOs for those refugees who require them.
The countries whose refugees automatically require SAOs before they can be admitted, in addition to Iraq, are Egypt, Iran, Libya, Mali, North Korea, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.
Iraqis can raise flags for national security concerns for a number of reasons, especially if their work for the military required them to keep tabs on militants and other potential threats.
Years after their work for the military has ended, it can be difficult to verify that their contact with suspicious individuals or groups was strictly related to their job.
A Department of Homeland Security official said on Friday that refugee applicants ""undergo more thorough security vetting than ever before"" and that the agency is ""making it harder for terrorists, criminals, and individuals seeking to exploit the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.""
During the White House meeting last week, Pentagon officials offered to lend staff to the FBI to help them process the checks faster and potentially resolve concerns about information unearthed during the checks.

As of the end of July, there were more than 100,000 Iraqis who had applied to the special refugee program and were at various stages of the admission process, according to U.S. government data seen by Reuters.

Sharif was convicted of corruption by an anti-graft court in July and jailed for 10 years. His and his daughter Maryam Nawaz, sentenced to seven years on the same charges, are appealing against their convictions.
One-time national cricket captain Khan won elections in July after spearheading a campaign in the courts and on the streets against Sharif, alleging he and his family plundered the country's exchequer and laundered money abroad.
They deny the allegations, and accuse Khan of being a military stooge.
Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said the ban on Sharif and his daughter, agreed in the inaugural meeting of Khan's cabinet, was part of his government's efforts to strengthen the accountability process. 
""It has been decided that the names of Nawaz Sharif and his daughter will be placed on exit control list,"" Chaudhry told reporters in Islamabad. 
Sharif, a three-time prime minister, was removed from office by the Supreme Court last year, and sentenced over ownership of luxury apartments in London weeks before the July 25 election. He was arrested upon his return home from London on July 13.
His third five-year term in government was characterized by discord with the military, which has ruled Pakistan for nearly half its 71-year history.
Sharif and his daughter challenged their convictions in a higher court, which on Monday concluded hearings and is due to announce a judgment at a later date.

1005,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2018 10:51AM ET</span>",Irish abuse survivors await Pope's arrival with scepticism,"By Padraic Halpin
DUBLIN (Reuters) - Andrew Madden became the first victim of clerical child sex abuse in Ireland to speak out publicly in 1995 when he detailed how, as a 12-year-old altar boy, he suffered two-and-a-half years of abuse at the hands of his parish priest.
Over the next 15 years floods of similar stories followed as harrowing state investigations unearthed endemic sexual abuse and cover-up that rocked the church's standing in the once staunchly Roman Catholic country.
When Pope Francis makes the first papal visit to Ireland in nearly 40 years this weekend, Madden, a Dubliner, will be a long way away.
""I did not want to be here and watch a load of people flag-waving after all this church has done. To see that institution being cheered on when there are so many unanswered questions, I would find it sickening,"" said Madden, who will be in Rome when the Pope addresses an expected 500,000 people in Dublin on Sunday.
""I don't have any expectations of the pope telling the truth about what the Vatican knew and its knowledge of all that was covered up. It has had plenty of time to respond appropriately to what's happened in this country and elsewhere.""
Many abuse survivors share Madden's scepticism, according to campaigners, and have been angered that the issue of abuse - which in Ireland extended to the treatment of women and girls in the notorious Magdalene Laundries and Catholic-run mother-and-baby homes - is not front and center in the pope's plans.
When the Archbishop of Dublin, Diarmuid Martin, said earlier this month that ""time was very tight"" for Pope Francis to meet survivors of church abuse during his two-day visit, there was a furious reaction from those who had suffered.
The Vatican says it does not put the pope's meetings with victims of sexual abuse on his schedule for trips. When he has met victims of abuse during trips, such as in Chile in January and in Philadelphia in 2015, they were announced shortly after they ended. 
Vatican spokesman Greg Burke said: ""These are often intimate, soul-searing meetings that can produce tears on both sides. The pope wants to respect their privacy and then victims can talk about it later if they wish. Not all victims want something public, and, if a meeting takes place, those who prefer that the contents remain private should not be excluded.""
The pope does not, as a rule, meet victims of clergy sexual abuse on every trip abroad.
However campaigners in Ireland say they fear any such meeting will be a token gesture. Marie Collins, a clerical abuse survivor who has spent the last 20 years campaigning for reform, said the pope should meet a representative group of survivors who will challenge him to take concrete actions on tackling abuse.
""I do feel there was an effort by the church to airbrush the whole issue of abuse out of the picture during the pope's visit because it might be an unpleasantness. When the suggestion was made that there wasn't enough time, there was huge anger amongst survivors, including myself,"" Collins said.
""It shows how really in the church there is this view of abuse as something that if we ignore it, it will go away and if we don't talk about it, it's not happening. That couldn't be allowed to stand.""
TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE
The issue of abuse has come into greater focus ahead of the visit after a grand jury report last week detailed 70 years of widespread abuse by hundreds of priests in Pennsylvania and a systematic cover-up campaign by bishops.
Responding to simultaneous sexual abuse crises in several countries on Monday, Pope Francis wrote an unprecedented letter to all the world's Catholics promising that no effort would be spared to prevent abuse and its cover-up.
Collins said no survivor would have been surprised by what they read in the Pennsylvania report, but it still brought back memories of her own abuse by a hospital chaplain in 1960s Ireland that triggered 25 years of depression and panic attacks.
She intends to spend next Sunday with other survivors, their families and supporters at an event at a central Dublin memorial garden organized by fellow campaigner Colm O'Gorman.
O'Gorman, who was 13 when Pope John Paul II came to Ireland in 1979 and was raped by a priest for the first time a year and half later, says the event, which has attracted the interest of thousands of people on social media, is not a protest but a space for those who need to stand together for solidarity. 
Whatever message Pope Francis delivers 3 km away when he says mass at Dublin's Phoenix Park will be too little too late, said O'Gorman.
""If the Vatican was approaching this issue with integrity, a pope would have come here (15 years ago) and not just kissed the ground when he landed, but gotten on his knees and acknowledged the truth of what has happened in this country and the Vatican's role in it,"" he said.
O'Gorman's abuser committed suicide after he was charged but before he was put on trial. Collins' and Madden's abusers were jailed.
For Collins - who was a leading member of a group advising Pope Francis on how to root out sex abuse until she quit in frustration last year - the time for simple apologies has long passed.
""Apologies and I'm sorry it happened and that sort of thing is just no longer any use. We've heard that over and over again,"" Collins said.

""We need to know what action he's going to take to hold his own leaders to account for their behavior. It's children's lives that are at stake here, not the reputation of the church.""

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan appealed to Turks' religious and patriotic feelings ahead of a major Muslim holiday on Monday, promising they would not be brought ""to their knees"" by an economic crisis that has battered the lira currency.
The lira  has tumbled some 40 percent this year, hit by worries about Erdogan's influence over monetary policy and a worsening diplomatic rift with the United States. The sell-off has spread to other emerging market currencies and global stocks in recent weeks.
Highlighting the increased tensions, the U.S. embassy in the Turkish capital Ankara came under brief gunfire early on Monday by unknown assailants in an attack condemned by Erdogan's spokesman as ""an attempt to create chaos"". Nobody was hurt.
In a pre-recorded address to mark the four-day Eid al-Adha festival, which starts on Tuesday, Erdogan, a pious Muslim, sounded a characteristically defiant note as he lashed out at those selling the lira.
""The attack on our economy has absolutely no difference from attacks on our call to prayer and our flag. The goal is the same. The goal is to bring Turkey and the Turkish people to their knees - to take it prisoner,"" Erdogan said in the televised address.
""Those who think they can make Turkey give in with the exchange rate will soon see that they are mistaken.""
Erdogan stopped short of directly naming any countries or institutions, but he has, in the past, blamed a shadowy ""interest rate lobby"", Western ratings agencies and financiers.
DIPLOMATIC RIFT
Much of the recent tension has centered around a U.S. evangelical Christian pastor, Andrew Brunson, who has been detained in Turkey on terrorism charges, which he denies.
Brunson, originally from North Carolina, has lived in Turkey for two decades and has become an unwitting flashpoint for the diplomatic rift.
On Friday, a Turkish court rejected Brunson's appeal for release, drawing a stiff rebuke from President Donald Trump, who said the United States would not take the detention of the pastor ""sitting down"".
The lira weakened to 6.1950 to the dollar by 1328 GMT on Monday, from a close of 6.0100 on Friday.
On Friday two ratings agencies, Moody's and Standard & Poor's, further cut Turkey's sovereign rating into junk territory.
The downgrades confirmed prevailing concerns that Turkey ""is unlikely to avoid a significant slowdown in economic activity"" and that the lira's fall ""poses a risk to financial stability"", said Piotr Matys, an emerging markets strategist at Rabobank.
In addition to the lira, Turkey's sovereign dollar bonds fell and the cost of insuring its debt rose.
The German finance minister said on Monday the Turkish currency crisis posed an additional risk to Germany's economy.
However, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told her Christian Democrats at a meeting that she saw no urgent need to offer financial aid to Turkey to ease the crisis, the party's general secretary said.
Qatar and Turkey's central banks last week signed a $3 billion currency swap agreement, a move designed to provide liquidity and financial stability.

That came days after Qatar's emir approved a $15 billion package of economic projects, investments and deposits for Turkey.

(Reuters) - Argentina's President Mauricio Macri plans to report Venezuela's government to the International Criminal Court at The Hague for alleged crimes against humanity, according to an interview broadcast on CNN's Spanish service on Sunday night. 
Macri said he would seek to refer socialist President Nicolas Maduro's government ""in the coming weeks"", and that he had the backing of the presidents of Colombia, Chile and Paraguay.
""For me, there is no doubt: In Venezuela, human rights are systematically violated by steamrolling the opposition and everyone. There is a growing sense that we need to take more forceful action,"" he said, according to a transcript of the interview carried by Miami's Nuevo Herald, in which CNN interviewer Andrés Oppenheimer has a column. 
""Maduro has not changed at all. I am not optimistic in the short term of what is going to happen in Venezuela,"" Macri added. 
His comments came as Maduro announced a single exchange rate pegged to his government’s petro cryptocurrency, effectively devaluing it by 96 percent in a move economists said would fan hyperinflation in the chaotic country.
As tens of thousands of Venezuelans have fled to neighboring countries, there have been anti-immigrant riots in Brazil, and Ecuador and Peru have moved to strengthen their borders.
The U.N. human rights office has already sent a report on Venezuela to the ICC whose prosecutor opened a preliminary inquiry into alleged violations in February.

The report said that Venezuelan security forces suspected of killing hundreds of demonstrators and alleged criminals since 2015 enjoy immunity from prosecution, indicating that the rule of law is ""virtually absent"" in the OPEC member.

Moscow is bracing itself for a slew of new U.S. sanctions despite Putin meeting U.S. President Donald Trump at a summit in Helsinki in July, an encounter both sides said went well. 
Initial Russian triumphalism after the summit turned sour however as anger over what some U.S. lawmakers saw as an over deferential Trump performance galvanized a new sanctions push.
The U.S. State Department has said it will impose fresh sanctions by the end of this month, while bi-partisan legislation from senators calls for other curbs to be widened.
Moscow is also bracing itself for potential U.S. measures designed to frustrate its Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project. 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call that the new U.S. sanctions proposals were unfriendly, illegal and would harm world trade.
""Let's wait and see what will happen, if anything,"" said Peskov, saying any Russian response would be dictated by Russia's own national interests.

""The Russian president is hoping for the best and, despite all this, wants to pull our bilateral ties out of the deep crisis they are in. He (Putin) still has that desire. But at the same time nobody plans to go into mourning if our approach is not reciprocated by Washington.""

Police said the man entered the station in Cornella, in the northeastern region of Catalonia, shortly before 0400 GMT, seeking information.
He then leapt towards an officer, brandishing a large knife they said. The attacker, identified only as living in Cornella, was shot dead.
""However you look at it, it was a knife attack against an officer (by a man who) shouted ""Allah is great"" and other things that were impossible to make out,"" regional investigating police chief Rafel Comas told a news conference.
""For now, we are treating it as a terrorist attack,"" he added.
The attacker ""wanted to die himself"", police added on Twitter. Comas did not confirm Spanish media reports that he was a 29-year-old Algerian, saying only that he had been in the country ""for years"".
There was no evidence linking the attack with any terrorist cell, Comas said, adding that Spain would maintain its security alert at level 4, one notch below the maximum level which signals an attack is imminent.
Last Friday, Barcelona commemorated the first anniversary of an Islamist assault in which a young man drove a van down a busy central boulevard, killing 14 people and injuring over 100 in Spain's worst attack in more than a decade.
Separately on Monday, three people were injured when a car mounted a pavement in the northern town of Casetas, in what a government spokeswoman later said was being treated as an accident. 
The two occupants of the car fled the scene and were later detained.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia accused the United States of trying to break the spirit in jail of Maria Butina, a woman U.S. authorities say is a Russian government agent, and complained she was being subjected to ""borderline torture.""
Butina, a 29-year-old gun rights advocate living in Washington, D.C., was arrested in July and has been accused of acting as a Russian government agent while developing ties with American citizens and infiltrating political groups.
Butina, who pleaded not guilty, was detained without bail pending trial after prosecutors presented evidence suggesting she had connections to Russian intelligence operatives and was being funded by Russian oligarchs.
Her case, which Russian authorities allege is fabricated and politically-motivated, has become the latest in a series of irritants between Washington and Moscow at a time when ties are already languishing at a post-Cold War low over allegations of Russian interference in U.S. politics.
Russia's U.S. embassy said in a statement on Sunday that Butina had been transferred from a prison in Washington to one in Virginia on Friday without notice or explanation and that her personal belongings had also been confiscated. 
She had been subjected to a strip search and shackled during the transfer, it alleged, before being held in a cell for 12 hours without food and with the lights on. She now faced a solitary confinement regime, it said. 
""Her situation is getting worse. It's obvious that attempts are being made to 'break' Maria using additional humiliation and psychological pressure,"" the embassy said. 
""We have more and more questions for the U.S. justice system. Should Maria really be doomed to suffer such borderline torture before a court verdict on the allegations against her? This lawlessness must stop.""
U.S. federal prosecutors successfully persuaded a judge in July that Butina was a flight risk and should be jailed prior to her trial.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has raised the case with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, demanding Butina be freed. 

The next hearing in her case is scheduled for Sept. 10.

Challenger Soumaila Cisse had contested the electoral commission result of the Aug. 12 vote, which showed Keita winning 67 percent.
The election was tainted by armed attacks in the center and north, where hundreds of polling stations remained closed, and a turnout of only 34 percent reflected fears of violence as well as voter apathy.
Cisse says he would have won 51 percent of the vote but for ballot box stuffing and other cheating by Keita's camp. Keita rejected the allegations. 

The European Union observer mission and other local and international monitors said that, despite a number of irregularities and disruptions, they saw no evidence of fraud.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Uri Avnery, a left-wing peace activist who in 1982 became the first prominent Israeli to meet in public with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, died on Monday in a Tel Aviv hospital. He was 94.
The encounter took place during Israel's invasion of Lebanon and war with Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), then designated a terrorist group by Israel. Avnery crossed into west Beirut from the Israeli-held east. 
""It was the first time Arafat had met with an Israeli, and from this perspective, it could be called a 'historic meeting',"" Avnery wrote in Israel's Haaretz newspaper in February. 
Secret negotiations a decade later led to interim peace deals with the PLO on establishing a Palestinian state alongside Israel.
Israel's President Reuven Rivlin, a veteran right-winger, said Avnery had been dedicated to building ""a strong and free society"" in Israel, praising him despite their ""fierce differences"".
Avnery fled Nazi Germany with his family as a boy and became a journalist and politician, serving as one of the most vocal and articulate voices of the Israeli left.
His meeting with Arafat, after he traveled to Lebanon at the invitation of the Israeli military as part of a reporting trip, lasted about two hours and ""dealt entirely with the possibility of peace between Israel and the Palestinian people"", he wrote.
It was broadcast the same night on Israeli television and Avnery was questioned by police but ultimately faced no charges.
Avnery served as a lawmaker from 1965 to 1974 and, from 1979 to 1981, as head of a left-wing party. His death, after a stroke, was headline news in Israel on Monday.
In 2003, during the Palestinian uprising, Avnery traveled with other Israeli activists to Arafat's headquarters in the occupied West Bank, to act as a human shield against what they said were Israeli plans to assassinate Arafat after a Palestinian suicide bombing. 

Avnery wrote that working to prevent such an act was ""the most patriotic thing"" to do at that time since killing Arafat would have been a disaster for Israel. Arafat died in 2004.

Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo will review allegations that the Gupta brothers - who headed one of the country's largest conglomerates - unduly influenced Zuma over political appointments and winning government contracts.
The allegations and other scandals surrounding Zuma's nine-year rule forced him out of office in February. 
It was unclear on Monday whether he or the Guptas - who all deny any wrongdoing - will appear at the inquiry, which is empowered to make recommendations for prosecutions.
Zondo said at the start of hearings that a call for members of the public to come forward with evidence of influence-peddling had so far borne little fruit.
""The response has been quite disappointing. I would like to take this opportunity once again to ask the public to come forward with any information. If this commission is to do its job properly we need evidence,"" he said.
Zondo said in May that the inquiry could last two years.
It stems from a 2016 report into alleged influence-peddling by the Public Protector, South Africa's main anti-graft authority.
That report, which stopped short of asserting crimes had been committed, called for an investigation into whether Zuma, some of his cabinet members and some state companies acted improperly.
Among the cases it reviewed was an allegation by Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas that the Guptas offered to secure him his boss's job, as well as claims that Zuma directed state firms to award tenders to the Guptas.
Zuma says the three Gupta brothers - Atul, Ajay and Rajesh - are his friends but he denies any influence-peddling in their relationship.
The exact whereabouts of the Guptas are not known. The brothers, officials from their companies and their family representatives could not be reached for comment on Monday.
South African judicial authorities have declared Ajay Gupta a ""fugitive from justice"". He is known to have left South Africa for Dubai in February.
In a separate criminal case, Zuma is facing 16 charges of fraud, racketeering and money laundering relating to a deal to buy European military hardware to upgrade South Africa's armed forces after the end of apartheid in 1994. His denies the charges.
Cyril Ramaphosa, who succeeded him as president, has promised to crack down on graft and help revamp a stagnating economy that lost momentum and suffered credit downgrades during Zuma's tenure.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Iran urged Europe on Monday to speed up efforts to salvage a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and major powers that U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned in May, saying French oil group  Total  has formally pulled out a major gas project.
Efforts by the remaining signatories - EU members Britain, France and Germany plus China and Russia - to avoid the agreement's collapse are struggling as Washington has said any firms dealing with Teheran will be barred from doing business in the United States.
""Europeans and other signatories of the deal have been trying to save the deal ... but the process has been slow. It should be accelerated,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said. ""Iran relies mainly on its own capabilities to overcome America's new sanctions,"" he told a news conference broadcast on state TV.
European states have been scrambling to ensure Iran gets enough economic benefits to persuade it to stay in the deal, which Trump said was ""deeply flawed"". 
Washington imposed new sanctions on Iran in August, targeting its trade in gold and other precious metals, purchases of U.S. dollars and its car industry.
The European powers, China and Russia say they will do more to encourage their businesses to remain engaged with Iran. But the threat of the U.S. sanctions has prompted many major companies to pull out of Iran.
Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said France's Total (PA:TOTF) has formally left a contract to develop Iran's South Pars Gas project. ""The process to replace (Total) with another company is underway,"" he was quoted as saying by state TV.
Total, which signed the deal in 2017 with an initial investment of $1 billion, did not have any immediate comment.
Iranian officials had earlier suggested that China’s state-owned CNPC could take over Total’s stake in the offshore project. CNPC, which already has a 30 percent stake in the deal, is an experienced onshore oil and gas producer, but is relatively new to offshore drilling. 
WARY INVESTORS
Most of CNPC's experience lies in its subsidiary China Petroleum Offshore Engineering Company (CPOE), which has worked in shallow waters off north China.
""Once Total quits, that will trigger CNPC to take over automatically, according to the contract,” a senior Chinese industry source with knowledge of the deal told Reuters.
“But the question is not about if CNPC is going to take over as the operator, but if CNPC could deliver and advance the project without Total.”
China also faces challenges supplying equipment such as large-scale compressors needed for developing the giant gas project, as leading manufacturers could be barred from supplying to Iran under U.S. sanctions.
Carmakers PSA (PA:PEUP),  Renault  (PA:RENA) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) are also among those to suspend or drop plans to invest in Iran along with Deutsche Bahn (DBN.UL) and Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE)
Working to maintain financial channels with Tehran and facilitate Iran's oil exports, the European Union has taken steps to counter the renewed U.S. sanctions, including forbidding EU citizens from complying with them or related court rulings.
Washington has said Iran’s only chance of avoiding the sanctions would be to accept Trump’s offer to negotiate a tougher nuclear deal. Iranian officials have repeatedly rejected the offer.
""We do not want to revisit that nuclear deal. We want the United States to implement that (2015) nuclear deal"" Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told CNN on Sunday.
The United States will impose tougher sanctions in November which will target Iran's oil sales and banking sector. 
Iran's rial currency has lost about half of its value since April because of a weak economy, financial difficulties at local banks and heavy demand for dollars among Iranians who fear the effects of sanctions.

Under the 2015 deal, most international sanctions on Iran were lifted in return for curbs on the country's nuclear program.

OSLO (Reuters) - Scorching summer heatwaves and downpours are set to become more extreme in the northern hemisphere as global warming makes weather patterns linger longer in the same place, scientists said on Monday.
They said there was a risk of ""extreme extremes"" in North America, Europe and parts of Asia because manmade greenhouse gas emissions seemed to be disrupting high-altitude winds that blow eastwards in vast, looping ""planetary waves"".
""Summer weather is likely to become more persistent - more prolonged hot dry periods, possibly also more prolonged rainy periods,"" said Dim Coumou, lead author of the study at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.
""Both can lead to extremes"" such as heat, drought, wildfires or flooding, he told Reuters of the findings in the journal Nature Communications, based on a review of existing scientific literature.
Many parts of the northern hemisphere have experienced baking heat this summer, with wildfires from California to Greece. Temperatures topped 30 Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) even in the Arctic Circle in northern Europe.
The stalling of weather patterns could threaten food production. ""Persistent hot and dry conditions in Western Europe, Russia and parts of the U.S. threaten cereal yields in these breadbaskets,"" the authors wrote.
They linked the slowdown in weather patterns to the Arctic, which is heating at more than twice the global average amid climate change.
The difference in temperature between the chill Arctic and warmth further south is a main driver of winds that blow weather systems around the globe, they wrote. With less contrast in temperatures, winds slow and heat or rain can linger longer.
""Evidence is mounting that humanity is messing with these enormous winds,"" said Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, director of PIK and co-author of a second study about a severe 2016 wildfire in Canada.
""Fuelled by human-made greenhouse-gas emissions, global warming is probably distorting the natural patterns,"" he wrote in a statement.
The extent of Arctic ice and snow has been shrinking in recent years, exposing ever more darker-colored water and ground, which soaks up ever more heat and accelerates warming, they said.
Writing in the journal Scientific Reports, Schellnhuber and colleagues found that disruptions to planetary waves were a factor underlying 2016 wildfires in Alberta, which caused damage worth C$4.7 billion ($3.6 billion).

Tonga's prime minister on Friday backed down on calls for Pacific island nations to collectively lobby China to forgive their debts, after a source said China had complained about the plan.
Tonga is one of eight island nations in the South Pacific carrying significant debt to China, and had started building support to press China to cancel repayments.
Pacific nations were due to discuss the plan at a forum of regional leaders scheduled to be held in the tiny island nation of Nauru early next month, Tongan Prime Minister 'Akilisi Pōhiva told Reuters on Thursday.
Pōhiva said in a statement on Friday that ""after further reflection"" he believed the forum was not the proper platform to discuss Chinese debt, and that Pacific nations should each find their own solutions.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said he noted Pōhiva's statement of ""clarification"" and his positive appraisal of ties with China. 
""I would like to stress that China and Tonga are strategic partners of mutual respect and common development,"" Lu told a daily news briefing in Beijing.
""China will continue to provide support and assistance to Tonga and other Pacific island countries in achieving sustainable development to the best of its ability,"" he added, without elaborating.
A recent Reuters analysis of the financial books of South Pacific island nations showed China's lending programs had gone from almost zero to more than $1.3 billion outstanding in a decade.

The debt burden of small economies with little earning power has stoked fears the region could fall into financial distress and become more susceptible to diplomatic pressure from China.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called for dialogue with Pakistan in a letter to its newly elected leader and Pakistan also saw talks with its old rival as the ""only way forward"", Pakistan's foreign minister said on Monday.
New Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan offered an olive branch to India after his election victory last month, proposing talks to resolve a long-standing dispute over the Kashmir region. The two leaders spoke by telephone late last month.
""The Indian prime minister has sent a letter in which he congratulated Imran Khan and ... he has sent a message to open talks,"" Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi told reporters in the capital, Islamabad.
An Indian foreign ministry official confirmed Modi wrote to Khan on Saturday and ""expressed India's commitment to build good neighborly relations between India and Pakistan and pursue meaningful and constructive engagement for the benefit of the people of the region"".
The nuclear-armed neighbors have fought three wars since the end of British colonial rule in 1947, two of them over the disputed Muslim-majority Himalayan region of Kashmir, where their two armies face off other and occasionally exchange fire.
India has long accused Pakistan of encouraging separatist Muslim militants fighting Indian rule in the Indian part of Kashmir. The militants occasionally launch bloody attacks in Indian towns and cities.
Afghanistan has also for years accused Pakistan of supporting Taliban militants fighting the Indian- and Western-backed Kabul government.
Pakistan denies aiding insurgent groups in both Kashmir and Afghanistan.
Khan, in his offer to India last month, said Pakistan was ready to respond positively to any effort on dialogue.
""If India comes and takes one step toward us, we will take two,"" said Khan, who had been bellicose towards India while campaigning for last month's election.
Qureshi repeated a call for a resumption of talks, which have made little progress in recent years.
""We need a continued and uninterrupted dialogue. This is our only way forward,"" he said.
But Pakistani security policy is largely determined by its powerful military, not by civilian governments.
Pakistan's former civilian government, let by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, also sought better ties with India.
Hopes soared following a surprise visit by Modi to Sharif in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore in December 2015, the first such visit by an Indian prime minister in more than a decade.
But the hopes unraveled weeks later when militants attacked an Indian army base in Indian-controlled Kashmir.
India blamed Pakistan for the attack. Pakistan denied that.
Sharif's efforts to improve ties with India were seen as undermining his relations with his army.
Qureshi, who served as foreign minister in a previous civilian government, from 2008 to 2011, said his ministry would be in charge of foreign policy, but would take advice from ""national security institutions"", drawing a comparison to the way the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency advises the U.S. government.

He said he would soon visit Afghanistan bearing a message of friendship and ""new beginnings"".

ATHENS (Reuters) - European institutions hailed Greece's exit from its final bailout on Monday, expecting the debt-burdened euro zone member to stand on its own feet after nine years of financial nursing but the mood in Athens was subdued as many problems remain.
Emerging from its third bailout since 2010, Athens will rely on bond markets to refinance its debt, officially leaving behind a crisis that shrank its economy by a quarter and forced it to implement painful austerity.
Since early 2010, Greece has relied on the biggest bailout in economic history, more than 260 billion euros ($300 billion) lent by its euro zone partners and the International Monetary Fund.
The European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the euro zone's bailout fund, expressed confidence that Athens could manage without an international financial safety net.
""Today we can safely conclude the ESM program with no more follow-up rescue programs as, for the first time since early 2010, Greece can stand on its own feet,"" Mario Centeno, the chairman of the ESM's board of governors, said in a statement.
ESM's Chief Klaus Regling told a Greek newspaper that Greece could be a success story just like Portugal, Spain, Ireland and Cyprus - the other euro zone countries which needed bailouts after the global financial crisis - as long as it continues to work on restoring its partners' trust.
Regling described the end of the bailout as great news. ""The Greek people should celebrate,"" he told Sunday's Ethnos newspaper. ""Tomorrow, I will celebrate it with a good glass of ouzo.""
Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is expected to address the nation on Tuesday on the milestone exit, which will enable Greece to regain sovereignty and set its own economic policies.
Greek media reported he would symbolically make the speech on Ithaca, the island where Odysseus returned home from the Trojan war after a 10-year voyage recounted by Greek classical poet Homer. 
But with unemployment just under 20 percent, the mood on the streets of Athens was far from festive.
""I made much more money in my thirties than now,"" said waiter Costas Papaconstantinou, 54, at a cafe in the city center. ""Were it not for tourism, we would be finished.""
""There is no bailout exit, we will be under a bailout until 2060, until we pay off these loans,"" he said.
Shut out of bond markets after a fiscal crisis, Greece officially asked for a bailout in April 2010 with the IMF and its euro zone partners. They granted 110 billion euros in loans to avert a financial meltdown. Two more aid packages followed.
Post–bailout, Greece has committed to demanding primary budget surpluses - excluding debt servicing outlays - of 3.5 percent of the country's annual economic output until 2022, and 2.2 percent until 2060. The wounds of the debt crisis are still healing.
""Greece is finally exiting, albeit formally, a long bailout period that left behind 924,000 jobless, shut down 250,000 businesses and left most Greeks owing an internal debt of 227 billion euros to the taxman, pension funds and to banks,"" said Vassilis Korkidis, head of the Piraeus Chamber of Commerce.

He said it was more a day of reckoning and not of celebrating as the bailouts may be leaving but austerity measures and taxes continue to squeeze Greeks.

KOCHI/NEW DELHI, India (Reuters) - Indian health authorities prepared defenses against the spread of disease in flood-hit Kerala state on Monday as water receded and a huge clean-up gathered pace after the worst floods in a century killed more than 200 people.
Incessant rain since Aug. 8 in the southern state has swelled rivers and triggered landslides. Dozens of people are missing and nearly a million are sheltering in thousands of relief camps, state officials said.
""The biggest challenges immediately ahead are cleaning of the flood-hit houses, rehabilitation, and prevention of water-borne diseases,"" said Mahesh P., a village-level officer from Rayamangalam, some 45 km (28 miles) from Kerala's financial capital of Kochi.
Light to moderate rain was expected across Kerala on Monday, bringing some respite to rescue workers, who have been battling rising waters and mudslides to reach tens of thousands of stranded villagers.
Rainfall in the state during the June-September monsoon season has been more than 40 percent higher than normal, with torrential rain in the last 10 days forcing authorities to release water from dozens of dangerously full dams, sending surges into rivers that then overflowed their banks.
Anil Vasudevan, who handles disaster management at Kerala's health department, said the state was preparing to battle any outbreak of diseases in the relief camps and preventive medicines were being distributed.
Mahesh said villagers had all pulled together to rescue people and prevent an even bigger disaster.
""The bulk of the credit for the rescue goes to the ordinary citizens. The army, the navy, the local authorities assisted them,"" Mahesh said. 
""The flood has bonded the people like never before, with people sharing whatever they had.""
Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said there was no shortage of food in the state as traders had stocked up ahead of Onam, the state's biggest festival which falls on Aug. 25.
The state has canceled all official celebrations in connection with the Hindu harvest festival.

1027,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2018 04:11AM ET</span>","Tears, joy as Korean families separated by war reunite briefly after 65 years","By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - Some 90 families from the two Koreas were reunited in the North on Monday, weeping and embracing each after being torn apart for more than six decades by the 1950-53 Korean War. 
The brief reunions, which will last only 11 hours, are the first in three years, and took place in the North's tourist resort on Mount Kumgang after the two Koreas renewed exchanges this year following a standoff over Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs. 
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in agreed to the latest round of reunions during their first summit in April.
About 330 South Koreans from 89 families, many of them in wheelchairs, gathered with 185 lost relatives from the North, embracing with tears, joy and disbelief. Some were struggling to recognize family they have not seen in more than 60 years.
""Uncles, take my deep bow,"" said Seo Soon-gyo, 55, as her 87-year-old father, Seo Jin-ho, met with two younger brothers, Chan Ho and Won Ho. 
Kim Gyong Sil and Gyong Yong, 72 and 71, wearing light violet traditional dress of hanbok, stood nervously staring at the entrance before their 99-year-old mother Han Shin-ja turned up. They could not speak for minutes, wailing loudly and rubbed their cheeks and hands.
""When I fled home in the war,"" said Han, failing to continue as she choked up with emotions. 
The separated families are victims of a decades-long political gridlock between the neighbors, which has escalated over the past several years as Pyongyang rapidly advanced its weapons programs.
More than 57,000 South Korean survivors have registered for the brief family reunion which often ends in painful farewells. 
For years, Seoul has been calling for regular meetings between separated families including using video conferences, but the reunion programs often fell victim to fragile relations with Pyongyang.
During his summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in June, Kim pledged to abandon his country's nuclear programs if Washington provided security guarantees, but the two sides have since struggled to agree on how to reach that goal. 
South Korean president Moon, himself a member of a separated family from the North's eastern port city of Hungnam, said on Monday that the reunions should be sharply scaled up and held on a regular basis and include exchanges of visits and letters. 
""It is a shame for both governments in the South and the North that many of the families have passed away without knowing whether or not their lost relatives were alive,"" Moon told a meeting with presidential secretaries. 
""Expanding and accelerating family reunions is a top priority among humanitarian projects to be carried out by the two Koreas.""
Ninety-three families from both sides of the border were initially scheduled for a three-day gathering from Monday, but four South Korean members canceled their trip to the North at the last minute due to health conditions, the Red Cross said. 
Starting Thursday, there will be a meeting of another 88 groups of relatives, 469 from the South and 128 from the North, according to Seoul's Unification Ministry. 
The brief family reunions, which began in 1985, can be a traumatic experience for the aging survivors, they say. And time is running out, with many of them aged 80 or older.
Around 132,600 individuals are listed as separated families as of end-July. Of the 57,000 survivors, 41.2 percent are in their 80s and 21.4 percent are in their 90s, according to government data. 
The oldest South Korean participating in the latest gathering is 101 years of age.
""Most participants are elderly and many of them are suffering from hypertension, diabetes and have underlying medical conditions. Ahead of the reunions, we are thoroughly checking their health conditions so that they can attend the events as planned,"" said physician Han Sang-jo.
Many of the family members brought gifts for their North Korean relatives. Socks, underwear, basic winter jackets, medicine, toothpastes and food are the most common items, with gifts deemed too extravagant unlikely to pass muster with Pyongyang authorities.
""I've prepared for him some household medicine including digester and headache pills, nutritional supplements as well as some daily necessaries,"" Lee Soo-nam, a 76-year-old South Korean, told Reuters before meeting his older brother in the North separated by the war.

""He is very old so I really want to express my gratitude for being alive for a long time.""

1028,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2018 04:06AM ET</span>",Mahathir says China will sympathize with Malaysia's problems,"By Philip Wen
BEIJING (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Monday he believed China would sympathize with his country's ""internal fiscal problems"" as he seeks to renegotiate, or possibly cancel, more than $20 billion in Chinese-funded projects.
Mahathir said after meeting Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in Beijing he did not believe in confrontation with any country and stressed the benefits Malaysia stood to gain from increased exposure to Chinese trade, technology and entrepreneurship. 
""We hope also to get China to understand the problems being faced by Malaysia today,"" Mahathir told a joint news conference with Li.
""I believe that China will look sympathetically toward the problems that we have to resolve and perhaps helping us to resolve some of our internal fiscal problems,"" he said.
Mahathir did not mention the projects in question but he vowed repeatedly before his China visit to discuss what he called ""unfair"" Chinese infrastructure deals authorized by former premier Najib Razak.
Najib courted Chinese investment and was a cheerleader for President Xi Jinping's signature Belt and Road Initiative in Southeast Asia during his decade-long rule, but Mahathir has questioned the value of the deals and the risk that they would leave Malaysia ""indebted"" to China.
Mahathir made no mention of Low Taek Jho, the Malaysian financier wanted for his role in the multi-billion-dollar scandal at state fund 1MDB.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Malaysia believed Low was being harbored in China and that a request to extradite him would be high on Mahathir's agenda during his five-day trip. Reuters could not verify the report.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said he was not familiar with Low's case.
""But on principle, China is willing to, on the basis of mutual consultations, start normal legal cooperation with other countries,"" he told a regular news briefing. 
'FREE AND FAIR'
Li said China hoped that a further expansion in trade ties with Malaysia would result in greater balance in two-way trade and that China was ready to increase ""to a fairly large extent"" imports of palm oil and other agricultural produce to meet the needs of Chinese consumers.
China is Malaysia's third-largest export market after India and the European Union.
He said consensus reached during talks and a raft of memorandum of understandings signed during Mahathir's visit, including on a bilateral currency swap, palm oil, rubber and durian imports, sent a message that the two countries would ""remain friendly to each other in the long term"".
However, Mahathir, who turned 93 last month, offered only a qualified endorsement when Li, addressing him directly, asked whether he believed they had consensus on upholding free trade. 
""I agree with you that free trade should be the way to go but of course free trade should also be fair trade,"" Mahathir said.
""We do not want a situation where there is a new version of colonialism happening because poor countries are unable to compete with rich countries,"" he said.
The centerpiece of China's Belt and Road infrastructure push in Malaysia is the ambitious $20-billion East Coast Rail Link project, work on which has been suspended pending discussions over pricing.

Mahathir has also halted work on two projects worth more than $2.3 billion awarded to the China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau that have been linked to graft at 1MDB.

LONDON (Reuters) - The British government has taken over the running of a major prison from contractor  G4S  (CO:G4S) after an inspection found that staff locked themselves in offices to avoid prisoners who were using drugs and violence with near impunity. 
The Ministry of Justice said on Monday it had taken back the running of HMP Birmingham for an initial six-month period to counter ""squalid"" conditions where blood, urine, vomit and faeces were left in cells, showers and corridors, attracting rats and cockroaches. 
Inspectors to the prison said they were physically affected by the drugs in the atmosphere while their cars were set on fire during an arson attack. 
Peter Clarke, Chief Inspector of Prisons for England and Wales, said he had not seen anything like it before. 
""Think of squalor, filth, the air hanging heavy with the smell of drugs, the dilapidated physical environment, a sense of great instability, the feeling that at any time violence could break out. 
""Put all that together, and what you have is a sense of an establishment that could not possibly fulfill any of the objectives of imprisonment,"" he told BBC Radio.
The news is likely to revive the debate in Britain about whether private companies should be running core public services which came to a head earlier this year when Carillion, a contractor and outsourcing group, went bust. 
Across England and Wales, there are 123 prison establishments, including youth offender institutes and other detention centers, of which 17 are run by private companies. 
The Ministry of Justice said that in general contracted prisons are among the best performing across the prison estate. 
G4S is the world's biggest security company, employing 570,000 people in more than 90 countries. 
But the company has had its problems over the years. It hit the headlines in 2012 when it failed to recruit enough security guards for the London Olympics, forcing the army to step in at the last minute.
In 2016, the government took over the management of a youth offending center in Kent from G4S and last year the company started an independent review into its Brook House immigration removal center after a BBC program showed staff behavior which G4S called ""unacceptable"". 
The Chief Inspector of Prisons said HMP Birmingham in Britain's second biggest city had deteriorated dramatically in the last 18 months, with staff locking themselves in offices and prisoners openly using drugs.
It detailed one incident where a ""clearly troubled man"" who was struggling to maintain personal hygiene was drenched by prisoners who put a nearby fire hose through his observation panel. 
""What we have seen at Birmingham is unacceptable and it has become clear that drastic action is required to bring about the improvements we require,"" said Prisons Minister Rory Stewart. 
The government said it would put in place a new governor, more staff and move around 300 prisoners to other sites. 
G4S said the prison faced ""exceptional challenges"". Its shares fell 2.6 percent in early trading. 

""The well-being and safety of prisoners and prison staff is our key priority and we welcome the six month step-in and the opportunity to work with the Ministry of Justice to urgently address the issues faced at the prison,"" the company said in a statement.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Monday averted a possible leadership challenge by dropping targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions to appease his critics, say local media, as a poll showed his government losing voter support.
Conservatives in his coalition were reportedly sounding out colleagues for a possible leadership challenge before Turnbull on Monday announced the removal of emission reduction targets from the National Energy Guarantee (NEG) policy.
Under headlines such as ""PM's leadership on knife edge"" major papers said some government members were gauging support for Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton to replace Turnbull. Dutton said he supported the prime minister.
Asked whether his leadership was under threat, Turnbull declared: ""I enjoy the confidence of the cabinet and my party room"".
The leadership talk was fueled by an Ipsos poll published in Fairfax newspapers, which showed support for Turnbull's Liberal-National coalition falling four points to 45 percent, 10 points behind opposition party Labor and enough for a crushing electoral defeat. The next election is due by 2019.
Turnbull said his slim parliamentary majority and internal dissent, with some government members saying they would vote against the energy policy, left him no option but to remove the emission cuts that were part of the Paris Climate Agreement.
""Politics is governed by the iron laws of arithmetic and in a House of Representatives with a one-seat majority... if a small number of people are not prepared to vote with the government on a measure, then it won't get passed,"" Turnbull told reporters.
Though Australia remains a signatory to the Paris accord, the removal of emissions targets from the NEG mean the country has no legislative or regulatory path to meeting the agreement’s requirements.
Turnbull's move may relieve immediate pressure on his leadership, though internal peace is seen as fragile as the government's re-election prospects look dim. And having conceded on energy, he may face demands for other changes.
""It's a complete capitulation to the right-wing members of the Liberal Party of Australia,"" said Robyn Eckersley, Professor and Head of Political Science at University of Melbourne.
""Turnbull is desperately hanging on to his leadership above and beyond everything else.""
In 2009, Turnbull, then leader of the Liberal Party in opposition, crossed the floor to vote with the Labor government in favor of an Emissions Trading Scheme, a move that ultimately lost him the party leadership.

A successful challenge to Turnbull's prime ministership would have been the fifth change in national leadership since 2009, with no prime minister seeing out a full term in office since 2007.

Germany has demanded the release of several of its citizens, some of Turkish origin, as a necessary step to improve ties with Turkey.
Relations between the NATO partners soured after Germany condemned Turkey's arrests after a failed 2016 coup of some 50,000 people, and the suspension or firing of 150,000 others, including teachers, judges and soldiers.
Ties have improved in recent months, especially after Turkey released German-Turkish journalist Deniz Yucel in February.
Eight German citizens are being detained in Turkey on political grounds, including one arrested last week. Turkey has also arrested several U.S. citizens.

Germany has urged Turkey to improve ties with the United States and Germany, which would ease an economic crisis sparked by a sharp fall in the lira.

Nearly 500 people have died in quakes and aftershocks since July 29 across the northern coast of the island, which lies just east of Indonesia's top tourist destination, Bali. 
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman at the national disaster mitigation agency, said on Monday relief and reconstruction efforts had been ""intensified"".
""The rebuilding of public facilities like hospitals and schools is being speeded up,"" he said.
He said more than 100 aftershocks had been recorded since Sunday night's magnitude 6.9 quake, which sent panicked residents into the streets and cut power and communication lines across the island.
Aftershocks ranging between magnitude 4 and 5 were continuing on Monday morning and access to some areas had been cut off by landslides triggered by the tremors, according to officials in Mataram, Lombok's main city.
Sunday's quake came exactly a fortnight after another 6.9 magnitude earthquake which killed around 460 people and prompted massive search, rescue and relief efforts. 
Authorities estimate that the Aug.5 earthquake caused 5 trillion rupiah ($342 million) of damage on Lombok.
Hundreds of thousands of residents have been left homeless and are camped out in open fields, refusing to shelter indoors due to continuing tremors.

BEIJING (Reuters) - There is no accurate figure of the number of ethnic Uighurs who have gone to fight with militant groups in Syria, China's special envoy for the Syrian issue said on Monday, adding he hoped to return to Syria to gain a clearer picture.
China is worried that Uighurs, a mostly Muslim people who speak a Turkic language and hail from China's far western region of Xinjiang, have gone to Syria and Iraq to fight for militants, having traveled illegally via Southeast Asia and Turkey.
The Syrian ambassador to China told Reuters last year that up to 5,000 Uighurs are fighting in various militant groups in Syria.
Islamic State claimed responsibility for the killing of a Chinese hostage in 2015, highlighting China's concern about Uighurs it says are fighting in the Middle East and fears they may return to China to carry out attacks. 
Xie Xiaoyan told a news briefing in Beijing that China talks with all countries, including Syria, about the fight against terror.
""As for how many Uighur terrorists there are, I've seen all sorts of figures. Some say 1,000 or 2,000; 2,000 or 3,000; 4,000 or 5,000, and some say even more,"" Xie said, speaking after a visit to Syria, Saudi Arabia and Israel last month.
""I hope that next time I have the opportunity to go to Idlib to have a look,"" he added, referring to the last big swathe of territory still held by Syrian rebels.
Idlib is controlled by an array of insurgent groups, with Sunni Muslim jihadists believed to be the dominant force there.
China has blamed a group called the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, or ETIM, for many of the attacks in recent years in Xinjiang, though some experts have questioned whether the group exists in any coherent form. 
Xie cited a United Nations report that there were 20,000 or 30,000 people fighting with terror groups in Syria and Iraq.
""Certainly in those areas there are rather a concentration of ETIM terrorists. This is certain,"" he added.
It is not possible to independently verify the number of Uighurs in Syria, or Iraq.Rights groups and Uighur exiles say many Uighurs have fled to Turkey simply to escape Chinese repression at home, accusations Beijing denies.
Xinjiang is a highly sensitive issue for China.

Earlier this month, a United Nations human rights panel said it had received many credible reports that 1 million Uighurs in China are held in what resembles a ""massive internment camp"". China has accused ""anti-China"" forces of being behind the criticism of its record and policies in Xinjiang.

ARAFAT, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - As more than 2 million pilgrims from around the world braved stormy weather in Saudi Arabia on Sunday to begin the annual haj ritual, the country's health minister said there was no sign of any outbreaks of disease. 
Worshippers arrived in the kingdom last week for the five-day ritual - a once-in-a-lifetime religious duty for every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it, which retraces the route Prophet Mohammad took 14 centuries ago.
Several hours of heavy rain and thunderstorms forced pilgrims to take cover in tents and trudge through puddles, with civil defense warning of possible flooding throughout the evening but denying any adverse effects on the rituals.
Some pilgrims prayed at the Grand Mosque before heading to the Mina area or towards Mount Arafat, east of Mecca, where the Prophet is believed to have delivered his final sermon to followers.
They will all arrive by Monday morning at Mount Arafat. Eid al-Adha, or feast of the sacrifice, begins on Tuesday, when pilgrims begin three days of casting stones at walls in a symbolic renunciation of the devil.
Khalaf Aziz fled his native Syria three years ago and is performing his fourth haj, this one in honor of his grandmother who died earlier this year.
""My cousin died in an air strike and my uncle was shot to death, may they rest in peace. Two years ago, I performed haj for the former, and last year for the later,"" said the 32-year-old from Deir al-Zor. ""This year, I am doing it for my grandmother.""

The authorities have been preparing for months to ensure pilgrims' safety, Health Minister Tawfiq al-Rabiah told Reuters, with more than 30,000 health workers operating 25 hospitals and offering free medical services, including complex procedures like open heart surgery.
""Praise to God, everything now is under control and health conditions are excellent,"" he said in an interview at Mina Public Hospital.
FEELING REBORN
The potential for disease spreading among pilgrims, who spend five days in close quarters, often eating outside and sleeping on the ground near holy sites, is a perennial concern.
The world's largest annual gathering of Muslims has in the past also seen deadly stampedes, fires and riots, with authorities sometimes struggling to respond.
A crush in 2015 killed nearly 800 pilgrims, according to Riyadh, although counts by countries of repatriated bodies showed over 2,000 may have died, more than 400 of them Iranians.
Saudi Arabia stakes its reputation on its guardianship of Islam's holiest sites - Mecca and Medina - and organizing the pilgrimage.
The interior ministry has put in place measures to confront any security threat from militant attacks to political protests, but no specific threats have been detected, a spokesman said on Saturday.
Yemeni Qaboos Ghalib said he felt reborn performing haj for the first time: ""I hope peace prevails in the Arab nation in general and in Yemen specifically, and that the war ends.""
Pilgrimage is also the backbone of a plan to expand tourism under a drive to diversify the kingdom's economy away from oil. The haj and year-round umrah generate billions of dollars in revenue from worshippers' lodging, transport, fees and gifts.
Officials aim to increase the number of umrah and haj pilgrims to 15 million and 5 million respectively by 2020, and hope to double the umrah number again to 30 million by 2030.
Some pilgrims on Saturday hiked 700 metres (2,300 feet) to the tiny Hira cave, where Muslims believe the Prophet was visited by the Angel Gabriel and began to receive Koranic recitations.

""It's indescribable. It's overwhelming to see how his impact has been on this world,"" said American pilgrim Nasser Mahmoud. ""But that's where it all started. It's a very humble thing, you can't even stand there.""

Nassar was at a federal transfer facility in Oklahoma City after being removed from a penitentiary in Tucson, Arizona, Federal Bureau of Prisons records showed. It was not clear to which prison he would be sent.
Last year, Nassar, 55, was given an effective life sentence by a Michigan court for sexually abusing young female gymnasts entrusted to his care. He is also serving a 60-year sentence for a federal child pornography conviction.
Nassar's lawyers said in a legal filing last month that the former doctor was assaulted soon after being released into the general population at the medium-security Tucson prison.
Officials from the Federal Bureau of Prisons and lawyers for Nassar were not immediately available to comment.
At his sentencing hearing in Michigan, more than 150 of his victims gave harrowing accounts of abuse at the hands of Nassar, who served as the program's physician through four Olympic Games and also worked at Michigan State University.

(Reuters) - The UK government said on Monday it was ending funding for some aid programs in rebel-held areas of Syria.
""As the situation on the ground in some regions has become increasingly difficult, we have reduced support for some of our non-humanitarian programming, but continue to deliver vital support to help those most in need and to improve security and stability in the country,"" a UK government spokeswoman told Reuters in an emailed statement. 
The Times newspaper had earlier reported that the attempt to create an independent police force would be scrapped from September, while projects funding local councils were being reviewed and would likely be halted by the end of the financial year.
The report added that the Foreign Office and Department for International Development had determined the aid programs in the northwestern parts of Syria to be ""unsustainable"".
The UK government said it had spent 152 million pounds ($193.85 million) on humanitarian programs in Syria for the financial year 2017-2018.
Britain had increased its aid as well as supply of armored vehicles and training to Syria's opposition in 2013 https://reut.rs/2PkklyO. 
Syria's northwest is the last major region still held by rebels.
The conflict in Syria has killed an estimated half a million people, driven more than 5.5 million people out of the country and displaced over 6.5 million within it.
In 2011, the United States adopted a policy that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad must leave power. But Washington and its Western allies, including Britain, have subsequently watched Assad's forces, backed by Iran and then Russia, claw back territory and secure his position.

MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (Reuters) - At least 19 people were killed in an Islamist militant attack on a village in northeast Nigeria in the early hours of Sunday, a survivor of the attack said.
The strike is the latest blow to Nigeria's efforts to defeat insurgencies by the Nigerian Islamist Boko Haram group and Islamic State in West Africa (ISWA). In recent months, the military has suffered its heaviest defeats in years, commanders have been repeatedly replaced, and special forces soldiers have mutinied.
The militants attacked the village of Mailari in the Guzamala region of Borno state at around 2 a.m., according to the survivor, Abatcha Umar. He said he had not been able to tell whether they belonged to Boko Haram or to ISWA. 
Umar said he had counted 19 people killed, including his younger brother. An aid worker at a camp that received the survivors, and who declined to be identified, put the death toll at 63.
The Islamist militants had been spotted around the village three days before their attack, said Umar. Locals had warned Nigerian troops stationed in the nearby town of Gudumbali, but no action was taken, he said.
The aid worker said hundreds of people from villages in the area had fled to the camp for displaced people where he worked, in Monguno.

IPIALES, Colombia (Reuters) - Dozens of furious Venezuelan migrants fleeing economic misery in Venezuela for a new life elsewhere on Sunday defied rules requiring they hold a valid passport to cross the border from Colombia into Ecuador, and authorities appeared to be allowing it. 
Hundreds of desperate people who traveled days from Venezuela, mostly by bus but some on foot, were prevented from passing the checkpoint near the southwestern town of Ipiales by a regulation set by Ecuador's President Lenin Moreno that kicked in on Saturday. 
But as tension mounted in the frigid Colombian mountain town, migrants decided to risk being detained and simply walked across the ungated and loosely guarded border, having spent days in freezing conditions at the Rumichaca crossing. 
""We have no money, we need to move on now and get our lives back,"" said Mayerly Isaguirre, out of breath from dragging her belongings up the steep hill at the Ecuadorian border. 
The primary school teacher, 37, was traveling with her boyfriend and had planned to cross legally with her Venezuelan national ID card en route to find work in Peru, where other family members successfully arrived weeks ago. But they were stopped by the new regulation. 
After more than 24 hours shivering from the cold at the border, she took the chance. 
""They haven't told us anything - we are just waiting around like idiots,"" she said, wheeling her fuchsia colored suitcase across the open check point as guards looked on. 
Peru's government announced immigration measures similar to Ecuador's on Friday, with passport requirements for Venezuelans beginning on Aug. 25. Ecuador on Sunday said children and adolescents traveling with their parents could cross without passports.
""They're in limbo,"" said Gustavo Salvador, a Red Cross Ecuador worker. ""Many people who are crossing illegally are going to be hit by fines at Peru's border, and these people don't have money.""
Ecuador's foreign and interior ministries declined to comment. A spokesman for Colombia's migration office could not immediately be reached for comment.
On Sunday morning, arguments broke out between migrants - those rallying for people to move on into Ecuador in groups while others argued they should stay and do things ""the right way."" 
More than a million Venezuelan migrants have entered Colombia over the last 15 months, according to official estimates, but Ecuador, Peru and Brazil also have received many.
Over the last two years, especially, many Venezuelans have struggled to obtain passports amid the OPEC nation's political and economic chaos. 
This year alone, 423,000 Venezuelans have entered Ecuador through the Rumichaca border. 
In Ipiales, Venezuelan migrants who said they had hitchhiked for days were huddled under blankets in tents. Exhausted and hungry, they scraped their last few pesos together to buy food. 
Many like Jorge Luis Torrealba, who traveled with 12 friends and family members, including two small children, were unable to find space in the tents and were sleeping on the freezing concrete pavement.
""We are from the Caribbean, we can't handle this cold,"" he said, shivering despite wearing four t-shirts, two sweaters, two pairs of socks and two pairs of jeans.

He said is considering trekking across the border to Peru but is afraid of what would happen to his children if he is detained. ""We just want to move on.""

1043,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2018 04:18PM ET</span>",Afghanistan announces Muslim Eid holiday ceasefire with Taliban,"By Rupam Jain and Sayed Hassib
KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan President Ashraf Ghani announced a ceasefire with Taliban insurgents from Monday to mark the Muslim Eid al-Adha holiday, days after fighting in the central city of Ghazni and a northern province.
Taliban sources said their leaders had also provisionally agreed a four-day truce during the annual Islamic feast of sacrifice, though supreme leader Sheikh Haibatullah Akhunzada still had to give his final approval.
The militant movement said it would free hundreds of prisoners, without going into further details.
Fighting has been mounting in the Taliban's insurgency against the government in Kabul and NATO coalition forces, launched after the Islamist group was ousted from power in a U.S.-led military intervention in 2001.
The truce announcement came a day after clashes erupted in the northern province of Faryab, an interior ministry official said. The Taliban had taken control of part of Bulcheragh district and more than 50 government forces were missing, he added.
This month at least 150 soldiers and 95 civilians were killed in a five-day battle for control of Ghazni. Afghan soldiers backed by U.S. forces managed to push back the heavily armed rebels last week.
Earlier on Sunday, the United Nations said blasts, suicide attacks and clashes killed more than 1,600 civilians in the first six months of the year, the highest number in the past decade.
CONDITIONAL
""The conditional ceasefire will start tomorrow and it will continue as long as the Taliban preserves and respects it,"" Ghani said in a ceremony celebrating 99 years of independence from British rule.
""We call on the leadership of the Taliban to welcome the wishes of Afghans for a long-lasting and real peace,"" he added.
A senior official in Ghani's office said the conditional ceasefire would run for three months, until the Prophet Mohammed's birthday which Afghanistan celebrate on Nov.21.
It would only cover the Taliban, not other groups including Islamic State, officials said.
Since the withdrawal of most foreign combat troops in 2014, the Taliban has made slow but steady gains, now controlling or contesting more than 40 percent of Afghanistan.
In June this year, Ghani announced an unconditional ceasefire with the Taliban for about two weeks. The Taliban observed a ceasefire over the three-day Eid al-Fitr festival but rejected the government’s request to extend it.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo welcomed the ceasefire and said the United States was ready to support and facilitate direct peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban. ""It is time for peace,"" he said in a statement.

Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of NATO, tweeted that he encouraged the Taliban ""to demonstrate their concern for Afghans by respecting (the ceasefire)"".

PACARAIMA, Brazil (Reuters) - Fearful Venezuelan immigrants lined up in smaller numbers to enter Brazil on Sunday at the only border crossing between the two countries one day after violent protests by Brazilian residents drove hundreds back across the frontier.
The Brazilian army, which reinforces security at the Pacaraima border post, said 1,200 Venezuelans, including women and children, fled back into Venezuelan on Saturday when residents went on a rampage after the stabbing and beating of a local shop owner.
The angry demonstrators destroyed tents used by Venezuelans to camp out in the street near the bus station and set fire to belongings the immigrants left behind.
""The Brazilians came running with sticks and bottles. They burnt all our things, even the children's clothes,"" said Joana Perez, a 24-year-old mother holding a 6-month-old baby. ""I'm scared. I don't know where to sleep tonight or if there will be another attack. We lost everything. All I have is my ID card."" 
The outburst was triggered by the severe beating of a shop owner by four alleged Venezuelan immigrants on Friday, the state government said. But police declined to comment and had still not found the suspects on Sunday. 
Tens of thousands of Venezuelans have poured over the border into Roraima state over the last few years, fleeing economic and political turmoil in their country. The influx has overwhelmed the state's social services and brought a rise in crime, prostitution and disease, and has sparked incidents of xenophobia, Brazilian government officials say.
""About 1,200 Venezuelans went back to their country yesterday. The flow has restarted today but evidently there are less people coming,"" Colonel Hilel Zanatta, commander of the army operation at the border post, told Reuters.
A Reuters photographer who crossed into Venezuela on Sunday morning to the border town of Santa Helena de Uairen said the streets were crowded with thousands of people seeking to leave the country but fearful of a hostile reception in Brazil.
Venezuela's government said the attacks on its citizens were fueled by xenophobia and called on Brazil to protect the immigrants and their belongings.
The Brazilian border state of Roraima repeated a call to close the border, which the federal government has refused to do for humanitarian reasons.
Brazilian President Michel Temer met on Sunday with cabinet members to study the situation, but his top spokesman, Marcio de Freitas, said closing the border was not an option.

YORK, Pa. (Reuters) - Many churchgoers said they were sickened and saddened by a grand jury report detailing widespread sexual abuse by hundreds of priests in Pennsylvania but they would not let the Roman Catholic Church's cover-up dissuade them from their faith. 
Nearly 200 parishioners filled almost all the pews for Saturday’s Mass at St. Patrick’s Church in York, Pennsylvania, where six priests who at one time worked in that parish are accused in the report https:// of sexually abusing children. 
“I can't talk about it without crying,"" said Kathy Morris, a retired steelworker and a member of St. Patrick's for over 15 years. ""I'm going to Mass to try to find some peace.""
“I’m disappointed that it happened but as far as the faith goes, I’ll never give my faith up,” said Anthony Giuffrida, 66, an usher and lifelong member at St. Patrick’s. “I was raised Roman Catholic and that’s what I’ll be till the day I die."" 
Few people attended the 9 a.m. service at St. Margaret Mary in Harrisburg where the report accuses Rev. Richard Barry of abusing boys in the 1980s. The parking lot was nearly empty, and a busload of seniors from a retirement community were among the few who entered the church.
Most attending the Mass declined to comment or made brief statements without giving their names.
""Our faith goes on,"" one woman said.
The grand jury report was the most comprehensive report on clergy abuse in American history, accusing hundreds of priests in six of Pennsylvania's eight dioceses of assaulting children for decades while the diocese covered it up, often sending priests to treatment centers and reassigning them to different parishes.
The results of the grand jury’s two-year investigation were the latest revelation in a scandal that has shaken the Catholic Church since the Boston Globe in 2002 reported on decades of clergy abuse and the attempt by the diocese to cover it up.
Allegations of clergy abuse in Europe, Australia and Chile have also emerged and prompted the resignation of several leaders within the Church, which has about 1.2 billion members worldwide.
Rev. Keith Carroll of St. Patrick’s Church said in his sermon Saturday that ""What is contained in that report is sickening and saddening."" He said he was “struggling personally” with “anger, utter embarrassment and sadness.”
Carroll implored his parish to not spurn the church because of the grand jury’s findings: “Only God himself can bring us out of this darkness.”
Many churchgoers echoed Carroll's hope that Catholics would not abandon their faith out of disgust with the church leadership's past behavior. Over 3 million people, about a quarter of Pennsylvania's population, are Catholic according to the Pennsylvania Catholic Conference.
Over 100 people attended Sunday Mass at St. Columba Church in Bloomsburg, formerly the parish of Rev. James Beeman whom the report accused of raping a 7-year-old girl while she was in the hospital.
""I’m praying for our church community to hold onto our faith because that’s still the best thing we have,"" said parishioner Mary Howe, 63, who has been a member at St. Columba since 1956.
Victims and their advocates said they were grateful that the report outed so many abusive priests. The report cited 301 priests, some of whom have died. Only two of the priests are still subject to prosecution.
""This is only the tip,"" said Mary McHale, 46, who testified before the grand jury and said she was abused by Rev. James Gaffney at her Catholic high school in Reading. ""It just multiplied inside me over the years. The shame and the guilt and the low self-esteem, that never leaves you.""
McHale supports her former classmate and state Representative Mark Rozzi, who said he was raped by his parish priest and is pushing to change a law to give victims of child sex abuse more time to file claims against their abusers.

State legislators expect to take up the bill in September, said Steve Miskin, a spokesman for House Majority Leader Representative Dave Reed.

A group of 33 MPs signed a motion accusing the minister, Masoud Karbasian, of being unable to manage the economy or form and implement policies.
That was enough votes to force Karbasian to come to parliament to answer questions on his record in the next 10 days.
If lawmakers are unhappy with his answers, they can vote to impeach and sack him - a move they took two weeks ago against Iran’s then minister of cooperatives, labor and social welfare, Ali Rabiei, after questioning his achievements.
President Hassan Rouhani is facing a growing domestic backlash since U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out in May from an international accord that had curbed Iran's nuclear ambitions in return for sanctions relief.
The rial currency has halved in value since April. A number of protests have also broken out since the beginning of the year over high prices and alleged corruption.
Washington imposed sanctions on the acquisition of U.S. dollars by Iran, and Tehran's trade in gold and precious metals this month. The United States has also said it will reimpose sanctions on Iran's oil exports and banking sector on Nov. 4.
Rouhani did not immediately comment on the motion, but defended Karbasian at a cabinet meeting earlier on Sunday, calling the minister's performance acceptable.
Parliament on Aug. 1 summoned Rouhani himself to come and answer questions within the next month, though without the threat of an impeachment vote - the first time lawmakers have taken this measure against him.
In late July, Rouhani appointed a new central bank governor, and accepted the resignation of the government spokesman, in moves seen as concessions to hardline critics.

Iran asked the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) on Sunday to protect it against the U.S. sanctions on its oil sales.

MILAN (Reuters) - Rescue workers found the bodies of three members of a family in the wreckage of Genoa's collapsed motorway bridge early on Sunday - the last people reported missing in the disaster, bringing the death toll to 43.
The bodies were recovered from a car crushed under slabs of concrete, the Genoa prefecture said, five days after a 200-metre section of the Morandi bridge gave way in busy traffic, plunging vehicles and debris to the ground 50 meters (165 feet) below. 
Nine people are still in hospital, four in a critical condition, the prefecture added.
All those listed as missing had now been accounted for, but crews would keep looking just in case, fire brigade official Stefano Zanut told Sky TG24. ""We won't stop. Our work continues in order to have the full certainty that nobody has been left under the rubble,"" he said.
Workers were also making the site secure and helping investigations to establish the cause of the disaster, he added. 
The viaduct was part of the A10 motorway linking the Italian port city with the French border to the west and was managed by toll-road operator Autostrade per l'Italia, a unit of infrastructure group  Atlantia  (MI:ATL).
Autostrade pledged half a billion euros on Saturday to rebuild the bridge and set up funds to immediately assist the families of the victims and those displaced from their homes by the collapse and reconstruction work.
The government has also allocated 32 million euros. ""Now we expect things to move fast and that people (who had to leave their homes) are given a place to stay,"" Prime Minister Conte posted on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) profile. 
HOUSING
The head of the regional government, Giovanni Toti, said the first temporary homes would be delivered on Monday and that all those who had to leave their apartments close to the bridge would be accommodated in the next two months. Around 300 houses would be made available, he added.
The government will launch a plan next month aimed at making Italy's infrastructure safe, Giancarlo Giorgetti, undersecretary in the prime minister's office, said in a newspaper interview, saying it would include motorways, bridges and viaducts but also public buildings such as schools.
""It will be a maintenance operation with no precedents, with enormous investment in public works,"" he told Il Messaggero. 
Giorgetti did not specify the cost of the plan but said ""deficit, GDP or European rules do not exist"" adding the European union ""will be benevolent"".
The European Commission limits the budget deficit of EU member states to 3 percent of GDP. 
The Italian government is due to update its economic targets in September before drawing up the 2019 budget and investors are concerned the government's spending plans might ignore EU fiscal rules and push up the country's debt, the highest in the euro zone after Greece.
On Friday, the government launched a procedure to revoke concessions held by Autostrade to operate toll highways.

Asked whether the government would halt the procedure against Autostrade if investigators found the group had no responsibility for the bridge collapse, Giorgetti did not answer.

Wael Saad and Ramon Rasmi Mansour, known by their monastic names Isaiah al-Makari and Faltaous al-Makari, were referred to the Damanhour criminal court for alleged involvement in killing Bishop Epiphanius, 64, the abbot of Saint Macarius Monastery, some 110 km (70 miles) northwest of Cairo in Wadi Natroun.
Saad was defrocked this month over what church officials called violations of monastic life, and later detained. Judicial sources said he had confessed under questioning to killing the bishop. There has been no indication of a motive.
The second monk, Mansour, threw himself from atop the monastery in an apparent suicide attempt this month. He has been treated in a Cairo hospital where he has also been questioned as part of the same investigation, judicial sources told Reuters. 
Sunday's prosecutor's statement said Saad had long had differences with his superiors, who had on one occasion investigated him for breaking monastery traditions.
It said Saad was accused of striking the bishop three times in the back of the head with a 90-cm (35-inch) steel pipe while Mansour stood guard outside.
Christians make up an estimated 10 percent of Egypt's roughly 96 million population.
Coptic Pope Tawadros this month ordered a freeze on accepting new monks, a ban on monks leaving monasteries without permission, and a ban on clergy using social media.

KOROR, Palau (Reuters) - Empty hotel rooms, idle tour boats and shuttered travel agencies reveal widening fissures in the tiny Pacific nation of Palau, which is caught in an escalating diplomatic tug-of-war between China and Taiwan.
Late last year, China effectively banned tour groups to the idyllic tropical archipelago, branding it an illegal destination due to its lack of diplomatic status.
As China extends its influence across the Pacific, Palau is one of Taipei's 18 remaining allies worldwide and is under pressure to switch allegiances, officials and business people there say.
""There is an ongoing discussion about China weaponizing tourism,"" said Jeffrey Barabe, owner of Palau Central Hotel and Palau Carolines Resort in Koror. ""Some believe that the dollars were allowed to flow in and now they are pulling it back to try and get Palau to establish ties diplomatically.""
In the commercial center of Koror, the Chinese pullback is obvious. Hotel blocks and restaurants stand empty, travel agencies are boarded and boats which take tourists to Palau's green, mushroom shaped Rock Islands are docked at the piers.
Prior to the ban, Chinese tourists accounted for about half the visitors to Palau. Of the 122,000 visitors in 2017, 55,000 were from China and 9,000 from Taiwan, official data showed.
Chinese investors had also gone on a buying frenzy, building hotels, opening businesses and securing large swathes of prime coastal real estate.
The decline since the ban was announced has been so sharp, charter airline Palau Pacific Airways announced in July it would terminate flights to China, four hours away, from the end of this month. 
The Chinese government was ""putting an effort to slow or stop tourists going to Palau"", said the Taiwanese-controlled airline, which has experienced a 50 percent fall in bookings since the China restrictions began.
China has previously used its tourism clout as a diplomatic tool, last year halting tours to South Korea after Seoul installed a controversial U.S. missile defense system.
Asked if designating Palau an illegal destination was a way of putting pressure on it to move away from Taiwan, China's Foreign Ministry said relations with other countries had to happen under the framework of the ""one China"" principle.
""The one China principle is the pre-condition and political foundation for China to maintain and develop friendly cooperative relations with all countries around the world,"" it said in a statement to Reuters, without specifically addressing the Palau issue.
The ""one China"" principle is a core government policy that states Taiwan is an inseparable part of China. 
Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs says China has lured four countries to switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in the past two years by offering generous aid packages and investment.

""While Taiwan faces serious diplomatic challenges, the government will not bow down to pressure from Beijing,"" the ministry said on its website. ""Taiwan will work with friendly nations to uphold regional peace and stability and ensure our rightful place in the international community."" 
SHIFT IN FOCUS
Palau President Tommy Remengesau Jr. said there had been no official communication from Beijing on the tourism restrictions. 
""It is not a secret that China would like us and the diplomatic friends of Taiwan to switch to them, but for Palau it is not our choosing to decide the one China policy,"" he told Reuters in an interview in Palau's second biggest city, Meyuns. 
Remengesau, whose second and final term as president ends in January 2021, said Palau welcomed investment and tourism from China but the current administration's principles and democratic ideals aligned more closely with Taiwan. 
Palau was adapting to the China pullback by focusing on higher spending visitors rather than mass tourism, which had taken a toll on the environment, said Remengesau, dressed in a lemon colored shirt and white shell necklace.
One of Palau's key tourist attractions, the saltwater Jellyfish Lake, was shut in 2017 after large numbers of swimmers were blamed for contributing to plummeting jellyfish numbers.
""The reality is that numbers did not mean big revenues for Palau. It actually made us more determined to seek the policy of quality versus quantity,"" said Remengesau, who in 2015 declared most of Palau's territorial waters a marine sanctuary the size of California. 
CEMENTING INFLUENCE
Former Palau government officials say Beijing is trying to cement its influence in the region ahead of the expiry of the Compact Funding agreements between the United States, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau in 2023 and 2024.
The United States provides around $200 million a year on average to the Compact states and is responsible for the defense of the three countries, which each hold a seat at the United Nations.
Last December, the U.S. belatedly approved $124 million in assistance for Palau through till 2024, but has not announced any plans to extend the Compact agreements.
""The United States and China are not zero-sum competitors,"" a U.S. State Department spokesperson told Reuters. ""However, we have concerns about the sustainability of debt loads for countries highly indebted to China, as well as the environmental, social, or labor conditions that often come along with Chinese-financed projects."" 
A June Security report from the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission said Beijing's increasing economic engagement in the Pacific was driven by its diplomatic and strategic priorities, including reducing Taiwan's international presence, gaining access to natural resources and developing a blue water navy.
Former Micronesian government officials said Beijing also wants to extend its Belt and Road Initiative to Palau, and could provide an important source of investment once the Compact agreement expires. 
""China is making overtures,"" said former Palau President Johnson Toribiong. ""We should be bringing in investors and that is a big factor in our Palau-Chinese relationship."" 
Toribiong, who served until 2013, told Reuters Palau should not isolate itself.
""I like Taiwan. But even Taiwanese want China now. The businessmen, they also want China. They don't care about political consequence. Think about the economics,"" Toribiong said. 
Palau receives $10 million annually from Taiwan, as well as education and medical scholarships.
Remengesau said Palau has not had any official talks with China for funding after the Compact expires but the government was discussing the issue internally. 
CHINESE MONEY 
China has quickly become one of the dominant economic players in the Pacific, spending billions of dollars in trade, investment, aid and tourism across Micronesia and the broader region. 
China's total goods trade with the Pacific Island Forum member countries reached $8.2 billion in 2017 versus $1.6 billion for the United States, according to the U.S. security report. Chinese concessional loans to Pacific islands have also risen sharply.
In contrast, Washington's efforts to strengthen its position in Palau have been largely superficial, according to locals who cite examples of bigger U.S. flags on their official vehicles and increased public signage. 
Chinese activity has slowed significantly, however.
Barabe, the resort owner, said Chinese investors had secured 99-year leases for around 60 hotel projects prior to 2017, but construction has been largely put on hold. 
At a lush forest site leased by China's Hanergy group, a rusting metal gate blocks the entrance with no sign of construction. Hanergy did not respond to requests for comment regarding the development.
At a nearby hilltop site overlooking the ocean and leased by another Chinese developer, the shell of a dilapidated mansion stands scrawled with graffiti. 
Jackson M. Henry, a real estate appraiser in Koror who helps Chinese companies lease land from local clans, said he was trying to set up channels to aid Chinese investment into Palau ahead of the next election in 2020. Pro business candidate Surangel Whipps Jr. was an early favorite to win the vote. 
Henry, whose previous roles included Palau's ambassador to Taiwan and Chairman of Palau Visitors Authority, said Palau wanted to be friends with both Taiwan and China.

""They (Chinese clients) are looking towards the next administration to improve the relationship with mainland China.""

Toninelli said on Twitter the European Union had to open ""its ports to solidarity"" and take in migrants rescued at sea. 
The government, made up of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the far-right League, has pledged to crack down on migration, even though flows are now lower than in the past. 
Italy has seen more than 650,000 arrivals on its shores since 2014.
On Wednesday, Malta did not aid a boat carrying 190 migrants which was crossing international waters, saying it was not in distress. Once closer to the Italian island of Lampedusa, the Italian coastguard vessel Diciotti picked it up.
The Diciotti has been at sea off Lampedusa for the past four days as the countries argue over where it should dock.
""They are now on board a military vessel, which practically means on Italian soil. I expect that Italy would ask other EU states to help, it is up to them, but Malta followed international law,"" Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said on Sunday in a radio interview.
Muscat did not comment on Toninelli's call for sanctions.
The row was the latest tussle illustrating how politically fraught the issue of coping with seaborne migrants remains despite a migration deal EU leaders agreed on in June. 
Over the past week Malta has rescued two boats in distress in its waters, one on Monday carrying 114 people and one on Saturday with about 60 migrants. 
There have been other stand-offs between Italy and Malta.
In July, Malta rebuffed Italian pressure to aid a boat carrying hundreds of migrants in the Mediterranean. [nL8N1U91L1]
Flows on one of the main migration routes into Europe - across the Mediterranean Sea from Libya to Italy - has tapered off as Libyan factions have cracked down on people smugglers. 
But people are still dying at sea and summer is peak season for migrants attempting the crossing, often in overcrowded, unseaworthy boats.
Since taking office in June, Interior Minister Matteo Salvini has led a campaign to stop the activity of humanitarian rescue ships out of Italy's ports and has toughened the stance on allowing ships to dock in the country's ports.

Postal workers have been sorting through thousands of mail sacks in the West Bank city of Jericho for the past several days after Israeli authorities allowed the entry of the letters and packages from neighboring Jordan.
The 10.5 tons of mail had been held in Jordan since 2010 because Israel would not permit direct transfer to the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, Palestinian officials said.
Mail for the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the borders of which are under Israeli control, first passes through Israel, enabling it to perform security checks.
Israeli authorities said the transfer was a one-time gesture and moves were under way to implement a 2016 agreement that would enable direct international mail links with the West Bank.
At the Jericho facility, a wheelchair and toys were among the items being sorted.
""A team was formed from across the city (Jericho) to deliver (the mail) to the people as soon as possible,"" said Hussein Sawafta, director general of the Palestinian Post Service.
But Ramadan Ghazawy, a Palestinian postal official, said some material could be difficult to deliver because the contents had spilled out of damaged envelopes and boxes, while the addresses on others were unclear.

""There are toys for kids. Maybe they were one year old when those gifts were sent. Now they are eight,"" Ghazawy said.

1056,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2018 09:39AM ET</span>",Baghdad gun shops thrive after Iraqi rethink on arms control,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - In the middle of Baghdad's busy commercial neighborhood of Karrada, where most retail outlets sell home appliances, shoppers can now also buy handguns and semi-automatic rifles legally for the first time in decades.
After the toppling of Saddam Hussein in 2003, illegal weapons trade flourished across the country. Looted guns from ransacked police stations and military bases were sold in streets and public areas to residents seeking to protect themselves in a state that was largely lawless.
The authorities have since been battling to curb illegal weapon sales and the government has stepped up efforts to control gun ownership through regulation.
The latest initiative came into force this summer and allows citizens to own and carry handguns, semi-automatic rifles and other assault weapons after obtaining official authorization and an identity card that also details the individual's weapons.
Previously, gun sales were restricted to firearms for hunting and sport.
Hamza Maher opened his new gun shop in Karrada after receiving official approval from the Interior Ministry and says there has been growing demand for his wares.
""Customers are mainly men, but the number of women buyers is growing,"" said Maher inside his shop, where a variety of pistols and assault rifles are on display. 
""The reason for buying is self-defense, and it's safer for citizens to buy a weapon from an authorized store instead of from an unknown source.""
Pistol prices in Maher's shop range from $1,000 to $4,000, while Kalashnikov assault rifles can be had from as little as $400 up to $2,000, depending on the brand and manufacturing origin, he said. 
Haider al-Suhail, a tribal sheikh from Baghdad, welcomed the legalization of gun stores. 
""Yes, it will decrease crime,"" he said on a visit to Maher's shop to buy assault rifles for his ranch guards. ""The criminal who plans to attack others will understand that he will pay heavy price.""

Parliament in June ordered a nationwide manual recount of the results, which were tallied electronically, after a government report said there were widespread violations and blamed the electoral commission.
Yet the recount showed little had changed from the initial results as populist Shi'ite Muslim cleric Moqtada al-Sadr retained his lead, positioning him to play a central role in forming the country's next government.
""The Federal Supreme Court issued on the afternoon of Aug. 19, 2018, its decision to ratify the names received,"" its spokesman Iyas al-Samouk said in a statement.
The ratification makes the results formal and lawmakers now have to gather and elect a speaker, then president and finally a prime minister and cabinet within 90 days.
The political uncertainty over the make-up of the new government has raised tensions at a time when public impatience is growing over poor basic services, unemployment and the slow pace of rebuilding after a three-year war with the Islamic State militant group.
Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's government, now serving in a caretaker capacity, welcomed the court's announcement.

""The government welcomes the decision by Iraq's Federal Supreme Court to certify the results of the May 12 parliamentary election. This milestone paves the way for the convening of the first session of the new parliament, and subsequently the formation of the new government,"" it said in a statement.

1058,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2018 09:05AM ET</span>",U.S. forces to stay in Iraq as long as needed: spokesman,"By Tuqa Khalid
ABU DHABI (Reuters) - U.S. forces will stay in Iraq ""as long as needed"" to help stabilize regions previously controlled by Islamic State, a spokesman for the U.S.-led international coalition fighting the militants said on Sunday.
""We'll keep troops there as long as we think they're needed ... The main reason, after ISIS (Islamic State) is defeated militarily, is the stabilization efforts and we still need to be there for that, so that's one of the reasons we'll maintain a presence,"" Colonel Sean Ryan told a news conference in Abu Dhabi.
The number of American soldiers could go down however, depending on when other forces from the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation deploy to help train the Iraqi army, he said, adding that about 5,200 U.S. troops are currently based in Iraq.
NATO defence ministers agreed in February to a bigger ""train-and-advise"" mission in Iraq after a U.S. call for the alliance to help stabilise the country after three years of war against Islamic State.
""Possibly, there could be a drawdown, it just depends on when NATO comes in and they help train the forces as well,"" Ryan said. 
Iraq officially announced victory over the militants in December, five months after capturing their stronghold Mosul.
The United States also has about 2,000 troops in Syria, assisting the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) clear pockets still under the control of Islamic State along the border with Iraq.
""We're starting to see a lot of collaboration between the SDF and ISF (Iraqi Security Forces) because it used to be that they would just come to the coalition, but now, we have them talking to each other as well,"" said Ryan.
The Iraqi military has carried out several air strikes against Islamic State in Syria since last year, the last of which a few days ago, with the approval of President Bashar al-Assad and the U.S.-led coalition.

SDF operations to finish off the militants on the Syrian side have been delayed by hundreds of explosive devices planted by Islamic State, according to Ryan.

China's military, the world's largest and currently undergoing an ambitious modernization program, has been an important focus of Xi's campaign against corruption since he took power six years ago.
Xi has repeatedly warned about the threat of corruption to the country and the party, and has vowed not to let up in the fight against it.
Dozens of officers have been investigated and jailed, including Xu Caihou and Guo Boxiong, both former vice chairmen of the Central Military Commission, which Xi heads and is in overall charge of the People's Liberation Army.
Guo was jailed for life in 2016. Xu died of cancer in 2015 before he could face trial.
Speaking at a three day-meeting of the Central Military Commission, which ended on Sunday, Xi said the fight against graft must remain ""always on the road"" and be deepened, the official Xinhua news agency reported.
""Go in hot pursuit of and strike hard against hedonism and extravagance,"" Xinhua cited Xi as saying. ""The anti-corruption fight must be unswervingly grasped, and will not change direction or form.""
There must be no no-go areas and a zero tolerance attitude maintained, with a full and comprehensive supervision system put in place to tackle the problem, he added.
China's military must ensure they and their families are upright and clean, and that they can ""resist the corrosion of unhealthy tendencies"", Xi said.
He also said efforts were needed to strengthen the leadership of the ruling Communist Party over the military ""to ensure a solid political guarantee for the building of a strong military.""
Serving and retired officers have said graft in the armed forces is so pervasive it could undermine China's ability to wage war.

The anti-graft drive comes as Xi steps up efforts to modernize forces that are projecting power across the disputed waters of the East and South China Seas and deep into the Pacific Ocean, though China has not fought a war in decades.

1060,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2018 07:45AM ET</span>",Vroom! Indonesia president a hit on social media after motorbike stunt,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian President Joko Widodo has created a buzz on social media after a video sequence shown at the opening ceremony of the 18th Asian Games culminated with the 57-year-old leader roaring into Jakarta's main stadium on a powerful motorbike. 
After his motorcade is held up by Jakarta's notorious traffic, the tongue-in-cheek video showed a formally dressed Widodo hopping onto a motorbike and apparently leaping obstacles and navigating alleyways before riding into the stadium. 
A seemingly unruffled Widodo then took his seat before opening the Games on Saturday evening at a spectacular ceremony involving around 4,000 dancers and a 600-tonne tropical landscape stage set complete with volcano.
By Sunday, the video of the president's dash across the city had more than 800,000 views on a YouTube posting by official broadcaster SCTV. 
It has also been a hit on Twitter, with the hashtags #proudtobeindonesian and #stuntman trending in the Southeast Asian country, where many of the 260 million people are avid social media users.
One Twitter user with the handle @dethabun even likened the performance of the president, who is often known by his nickname Jokowi, to actor Tom Cruise in the action movie ""Mission: Impossible"".
""This is only in Indonesia, My President looks a like @TomCruise on Mission Impossible movie, Bravo Pak @jokowi, You're da Best..,"" the tweet said. 
Some noted that the stunt appeared to draw inspiration from London's 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony where a video including a cameo performance by Queen Elizabeth and also James Bond actor Daniel Craig appeared to show the British monarch skydiving into the stadium. 
Indonesian media has speculated over what parts of the president's video were actually carried out by a stunt actor rather than Widodo, a self-confessed motorcycle fan who is often depicted riding motorbikes. 
Some commentators and social media users also suggested it would be irresponsible for him to actually do his own stunts, pointing to the risk of an accident or even militant attack. 
An opposition politician accused the country's leader of using the ceremony to try to try to burnish his image with young voters ahead of elections next year.
Rachland Nashidik, deputy secretary general of the opposition Democrat Party, said on his Twitter page the video aimed to ""masterfully"" create an image to forget the country's more fundamental problems over trade deficits which ""doesn't make us proud, let alone adoring.""
Artist-turned-activist Ratna Sarumpaet said she felt the video was ""tacky"", a waste of money and in poor taste after a recent series of deadly earthquakes in Indonesia's resort island of Lombok.

The last time Indonesia hosted the Asian Games in 1962, the country's first president Sukarno was accused by some of hosting the Games as a vanity project at a time when the economy was also struggling.

The suspects are accused of making illegal profits of 650 million yuan from the Philippines-based platform, which had more than 114,000 users, Xinhua said, citing police in Jiangsu province. 
The investigation into the gambling website was launched in January 2016 after a tip-off, the report said, adding that four of the prime suspects were traced through bank card information.
Calls to police in Jiangsu seeking comment went unanswered. 
Casino gambling is illegal in mainland China, with budding punters having to travel to the special administrative region of Macau that borders southern China's Guangdong province.
Fifty suspects in the online gambling case were arrested in Shanghai, Fujian, Zhejiang and Guangdong, Xinhua said, while another six returned to China from the Philippines and handed themselves in. They are now being transferred for prosecution.

USGS estimated the depth of the latest tremor at 7.9 km (4.9 miles) and said the epicenter was on the northeastern shoulder of the island at the foot of Mount Rinjani. There was no tsunami warning, and authorities later said there had been only minor injuries and limited damage.
Lombok, just east of Bali, the southeast Asian country's most famous tourist destination, has been rocked by a series of quakes and aftershocks since July 29, including a 6.9-magnitude tremor on Aug. 5.
Disaster mitigation agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said via Twitter that so far only one person had been lightly injured, two people had fainted and several houses were damaged in the eastern part of the island.
""It was very strong. All the lights went out,"" Asmaatul Husna told Reuters at a shopping mall where she works in Lombok's main town, Mataram.
Nugroho said activity on the island was normal and Mount Rinjani, where hundreds of trekkers were stranded after the July 29 quake, was closed and there were no tourists there.
Lombok suffered damage running to more than 5 trillion rupiah ($342 million) from the Aug. 5 earthquake, authorities said last week, putting the death toll at more than 430.
More than 350,000 people fled their homes after that quake to shelter in government-provided tents or makeshift structures in open fields. Authorities said aid was slow getting to some of the hardest-hit areas as they are remote.

1063,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2018 05:40AM ET</span>","Britain's May could face trouble over Brexit deal, Conservative lawmaker warns","LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May could face trouble getting her Brexit deal approved by the British parliament before exit day unless she changes her proposals, the head of an influential group of pro-Brexit lawmakers said in an interview published on Sunday.
Jacob Rees-Mogg, chair of the European Research Group, a faction within May's Conservative Party, is strongly opposed to the government's so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and favors a clean break with the bloc on March 29 next year.
""If she sticks with Chequers, she will find she has a block of votes against her in the House of Commons,"" Rees-Mogg, tipped as a possible successor to May, told The Sunday Times newspaper, describing the Chequers proposals as ""surrender"" to the EU.
""Of course the Eurosceptics in parliament are not in a majority on all issues, but we will inevitably be in a majority on some of them and that will make the legislation extraordinarily difficult if it is based on Chequers.""
The Chequers plan would keep Britain in a free trade zone with the EU for manufactured and agricultural goods. But some Brexit supporters have said it would mean parts of the British economy would still be subject to rules set in Brussels. 
Both London and Brussels say they want to get a divorce deal at the Oct. 18 EU Council, but diplomats think that target date is too optimistic. If May cannot get a deal by October, an agreement could be reached at the December 13/14 EU Council.
Rees-Mogg said letting it run to December would be ""very risky"", the newspaper reported, as that would only leave three months to get the deal approved by the British parliament. 
That would mean the government ""must come forward with a deal that Brexiteers like, because otherwise they might find it's much harder to get through parliament than they think"", he was quoted as saying.
Parliament will have two votes: one on the Brexit deal and one on the Withdrawal Agreement and Implementation Bill.
May is betting that the fear of a so called ""no-deal"" scenario will push many Conservative and Labour lawmakers to support a deal, but the numbers are tight. In recent votes, May commanded a majority of around six votes on major Brexit issues.
Britain's Brexit minister Dominic Raab will travel to Brussels on Tuesday in a bid to pick up the pace of talks with the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier, but the government is also stepping up planning for a ""no-deal"" Brexit.
Rees-Mogg said he believed a ""Canada-plus"" deal, a free trade pact along the lines of the EU's 2016 agreement with Canada but with deeper ties given Britain's already closer trading links, could command a majority in parliament.

""If the prime minister came to the House of Commons with a Canada-plus style Brexit, people like me would say, 'Yes, that's all right,' and people who are strongly pro-European would say, 'Yes, that's better than leaving on World Trade Organisation terms,'” Rees-Mogg said. ""So although that wouldn't be what people might choose, it could command a majority.""

He was speaking on the 65th anniversary of a U.S.-backed coup that overthrew a democratically elected Iranian prime minister, an occasion when anti-American sentiment runs particularly high in the Islamic Republic.
Comparing fresh U.S. sanctions on Tehran imposed by President Donald Trump with the 1953 coup that ousted nationalist Iranian Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh, Zarif said Tehran will not let history repeat itself.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday named senior policy adviser Brian Hook as special representative for Iran in charge of the Iran Action Group to coordinate Trump's pressure campaign against the Islamic Republic following Washington's withdrawal from an international nuclear deal with Tehran.
Zarif tweeted: ""65 years ago today, the US overthrew the popularly elected democratic government of Dr. Mossadegh, restoring the dictatorship & subjugating Iranians for the next 25 years. Now an “Action Group” dreams of doing the same through pressure, misinformation & demagoguery. Never again.""
The United States and Britain orchestrated the removal of Mossadegh after he acted to nationalize Iran's oil industry, restoring to power Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi. The Western-backed shah was toppled in Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution. 
Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani said the coup was the best historical lesson that Americans cannot be trusted.
""How dare you talk about the freedom of the Iranian nation with your dark record of the Aug. 19 coup, and the appointment of a puppet totalitarian regime,"" Larijani was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA, referring to the shah's rule. 
""Americans are imposing sanctions but they claim they are supporting freedom, human rights, and global and regional security,"" Larijani said.
The 1953 Anglo-American coup remains an open wound in Iran’s relations with the West. In March 2000, then-U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright became the first senior American official to acknowledge the American role in the coup, calling it ""a setback for Iran's political development"". 
Washington and Tehran have had no diplomatic relations since the shah's fall. Decades of hostility eased somewhat with the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and then-U.S. President Barack Obama's administration and five other world powers. But high tensions resumed after Trump pulled Washington out of the deal, calling it flawed in Iran's favor.

The suspects are said to have illegally excavated items from the Dulan tombs, which lie along the ancient Silk Road, and subsequently arranged their sale.
Several of the arrests were made in provinces further east following an investigation that began in 2017, the ministry said.

Of the 646 items recovered, 16 were classed as first-class cultural relics, according to a ministry statement.
Partial excavations of the Dulan tombs have revealed a valuable collection of ancient silk textiles and garments, including from Central Asia and Byzantium, according to the New York-based World Monuments Fund.

KOCHI, India (Reuters) - A deluge in India's flood-stricken southwestern state of Kerala finally let up on Sunday, giving some respite for thousands of marooned families, while authorities feared an outbreak of disease among two million people crammed into relief camps.
Incessant rains since Aug. 8 have caused the state's worst floods in a century, and at least 186 people have perished, many of them killed by landslides. The beaches and backwaters of Kerala are top destinations for domestic and international tourists, but far fewer visit during the monsoon season.
The India Meteorological Department forecast heavy rainfall only at one or two places of Kerala on Sunday and withdrew a red alert in several districts. Flood waters too began to recede from several places.

Using boats and helicopters, India's military has led rescue efforts to reach people in communities cut off for days by the floods, with many trapped on roof tops and the upper floors of their homes, and in desperate need of food and potable water.
Rescue teams were focused on the town of Chengannur on the banks of the Pamba River, where some 5,000 people are feared to be trapped, officials said.
More than 200,000 families have taken refuge at relief camps set up across the state, an official at the Kerala State Disaster Management office said. Kerala's chief minister had earlier said two million people had taken shelter in camps since the monsoon rains began three months ago.

Anil Vasudevan, who handles disaster management at the Kerala health department, said authorities had isolated three people with chickenpox in one of the relief camps in Aluva town, nearly 250 km (155 miles) from state capital Thiruvananthapuram.
He said the department was preparing to deal with a possible outbreak of water-borne and air-borne diseases in the camps, where an estimated two million people have taken shelter since the monsoon rains began three months ago.
Kerala, which usually receives high rainfall, has seen over 250 percent more rain than normal between Aug. 8 and Aug. 15, causing the state authorities to release water from 35 dangerously full dams, sending a surge into its main river.
As the rain abated on Sunday morning, one resident in Cheranelloor, a suburb of Kochi situated on the banks of the Periyar river, visited his home to see when he and his family could return.
""The entire house is covered with mud. It will take days to clean to make it liveable. All our household articles, including the TV and fridge have been destroyed,"" 60-year-old T P Johnny told Reuters.
Kochi's airport is closed due to waterlogging, and Jet Airways has arranged additional flights from Thiruvananthapuram for passengers holding confirmed tickets from Kochi.
India's national carrier Air India will operate ATR flights from the naval airport in Kochi to Bangalore and Coimbatore, starting Monday.
Late on Saturday, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that there was no shortage of food in the state as traders had stocked up ahead of a local festival.
""The only problem is transporting it,"" he told reporters. ""The central government and public have cooperated well in this effort to fight this disaster.""
He also said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who visited the state on Saturday, announced an assistance of 5 billion Indian rupees ($71 million) against his request for 20 billion.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum of the United Arab Emirates, where many Keralites work, has also offered assistance to the state.

The U.S. Tsunami Warning Center also said the quake was too deep to cause a tsunami.
The quake's depth at 347.7 miles (560 km) would have dampened the shaking at the surface.
The director of Fiji's Mineral Resources Department, which runs the country's seismology unit, told Reuters on Sunday the earthquake was widely felt, but there were no reports of damage.
""We are monitoring the situation and some places felt it, but it was a very deep earthquake,"" Director Apete Soro said by telephone.
The quake was initially reported as a magnitude 8.0 and then upgraded to 8.2, a magnitude that could cause tremendous damage had it not been so deep.
""I would not expect any damage. People will feel it but it's so deep that I would not expect any damage,"" USGS geophysicist Jana Pursley said by telephone.
The epicenter was located 167 miles (270 km) east of Levuka in Fiji and 275 miles (443 km) west of Neiafu in Tonga.

MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte thinks political dynasties are bad. But the way the prevailing political winds are blowing, it looks like a dynasty of his own might be taking shape.
Nine months away from mid-term elections that could determine the success or failure of his presidency, his daughter, Sara Duterte, is fast emerging as a power-broker who is aiming to shore up support for his ambitious policy agenda, and, say some experts and insiders, his eventual succession.
By his own admission, the 73-year-old president is flagging. On Tuesday, he lamented his uphill struggle to tackle illicit drugs and cut state corruption, predicting that he'll ""hardly make a dent"" in his remaining four years in office.
During a ceremony and again at a dinner afterwards, he said he was tired, exasperated and thinking about quitting, and ended his somber, one hour, 20 minute speech with: ""I'm telling you, I'm ready to step down and retire.""
That contrasts sharply from his 40-year-old daughter, who has started maneuvering to build alliances and expand her small party in the southern Davao region into a new political juggernaut, as fissures appear in her father's ruling PDP-Laban party. 
She was instrumental in bringing together political factions to stage a dramatic July 23 ousting of divisive Duterte ally Pantaleon Alvarez as lower house speaker, replacing him with veteran Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, 71, a former president with clout and connections to ensure support for Duterte and his agenda.
The move was helped by a relationship developing between Sara Duterte and Imee Marcos, 62, a provincial governor and key figure in the still influential family of late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, who ruled the Philippines for two decades before being ousted in a 1986 uprising.
The two women posed together for pictures last week, each with one hand doing Duterte's trademark clenched fist, and making a ""V"" sign synonymous with the rule of Marcos with the other.
(For a graphic on 'Philippine First Daughters' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2KV4KT7)
Rodrigo Duterte's rise has been a boon for the Marcos family. Imee Marcos frequently attends his official events and in 2016, Duterte granted her longstanding wish for her father to be buried with military honors at a Manila heroes' cemetery. 
Duterte also said last week that if he steps down, her brother, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, a former senator better known as ""Bongbong"", would have been a capable replacement for him.
Marcos Jr came a close second to Leni Robredo, a rival of Duterte, in the 2016 vice presidential election, but he has challenged the result in the Supreme Court. 
""NEW CENTER OF GRAVITY""
Richard Heydarian, an author, columnist and academic who specializes in politics, said the Marcos family wanted to stay relevant nationally and in a political culture where loyalties easily shift, Sara Duterte was now widely seen as a figure worth rallying behind.
""People around (Rodrigo) Duterte are looking for a new center of gravity. They see signs of an exhausted president and see there could be some kind of succession that can protect their interests,"" he said.
""He has a very shallow network of politicians, he's not at his peak. He just has to hold on as long as he can.""
Duterte acknowledges that, and on Tuesday said he can't resign because a constitutional succession would mean handing power to opposition leader and vice president Robredo, who was elected separately. He said Robredo isn't up to the job - which she refutes - and he'd prefer a junta takes over. 
Duterte's relationship with daughter Sara has however often appeared rocky and she has portrayed herself as his reluctant successor as mayor of Davao City. 
Like her father, she is feared and respected, and known for being blunt, unpredictable and for openly trading barbs with the president.
Despite that, few doubt her loyalty to him. Although she denies being interested, she and other Duterte allies, including his spokesman, his special assistant and his former police chief, are tipped to run for the 24-seat Senate in 2019, as is Imee Marcos. 
That could be a game-changer for the president, who has built a strong majority in the House of Representatives but needs control of the upper house to deliver on his promises.
Among a raft of plans, he wants to redraft the constitution and deliver his centerpiece economic policy, a $180 billion infrastructure spree designed to modernize the country, spur spending, create jobs and lure investment. 
""Now is the chance to further consolidate power by controlling both houses of congress and the local government units so all of us can we move forward in cadence,"" said a member of a nine-party alliance formed by Sara Duterte last week.
He requested anonymity, saying only Sara Duterte could speak about the alliance.
""The goal is, fill the Senate with people who can help ... We don't want people who will only obstruct his plans.""
Opposition lawmaker Antonio Tinio said Rodrigo Duterte was essentially a local politician thrust into the presidency and needed national level allies.
""Hence, his alliance with the Marcoses and Gloria Arroyo,"" he said. 
Tinio is skeptical about Duterte's talk of retirement and is among many opponents who suspect he'll try to continue beyond his permitted single six-year term - an idea Duterte this week said was idiotic.
Plan B, Tinio said, was his daughter succeeding him.

""If efforts to extend the term of President Duterte through charter change fail, it's very likely that the Dutertes' Davao formula for dynastic succession will prevail,"" he said.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Angry residents of the Brazilian border town of Pacaraima ran riot and drove out Venezuelan immigrants on Saturday after a local restaurant owner was stabbed and beaten, residents and government officials said.
The demonstrations forced hundreds of Venezuelans to flee back across the frontier on foot and residents set fire to the belongings they left behind and to tires to block the only road crossing between the two countries, video images released by the state of Roraima government showed.
The outburst of anger was sparked by the robbery and severe beating of a resident in his home on Friday night by four Venezuelans, Roraima state security secretary Giuliana Castro said by telephone. 
The four Venezuelan suspects stole 23,000 reais ($5,800) from the restaurant owner, identified only as Raimundo. He suffered head injuries and was taken to hospital unconscious but was reported to be out of danger, said Castro, who is also head of the state's police force. 
After crossing back into their country, Venezuelans migrants attacked a group of 30 Brazilians who were shopping across the border and who had to be taken to a shelter, Castro said.
Venezuela's government expressed concern about reports of attacks on its citizens and a ""massive eviction"" of Venezuelans, and asked Brazil to guarantee their safety. A foreign ministry statement said the violence was fueled by xenophobia.
Tens of thousands of Venezuelans have poured over the border into Roraima state over the last few years, fleeing economic and political turmoil in their country. The influx has overwhelmed the state's social services and brought a rise in crime, prostitution and disease, and has sparked incidents of xenophobia, Brazilian government officials say.
A Pacaraima resident who asked to be identified only as Ismael said by telephone that the four Venezuelans allegedly entered the restaurant owner's home, tied him and his wife up and stabbed and beat the man severely before robbing his house.
""The people here are up in arms. They are burning the belonging of Venezuelans who were camped out here,"" Ismael said. He said police were looking for the four men.
""Out, out, out! Go back to Venezuela,"" demonstrators shouted at the Venezuelans as they rushed passed the border post carrying what they could, video images distributed by the Roraima government showed.
Brazilian army soldiers stationed at Pacaraima to help maintain order asked Venezuelan immigrants to return across the border for their own safety, Castro said.
Venezuela's economy has been in steep decline and there are periodic waves of protests against the leftist government of President Nicolas Maduro. Maduro argues that he is the victim of a Washington-led ""economic war"" designed to sabotage his administration through sanctions and price-gouging.
""The only people responsible for this tragedy are Maduro and his gang,"" tweeted Venezuelan opposition politician Ismael Garcia about the flare-up in Brazil.
The Roraima government has declared the immigration influx a social crisis and asked Brazil's federal government to close the border, which it will not do for humanitarian reasons.
The Brazilian government said late on Saturday that it was sending more troops to Pacaraima to back up border police.

Scholz told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper that securing stable pension levels was a top priority for his party, which has seen its political support drop to historic lows since the 2017 election.
The ruling coalition has agreed only to keep pensions stable until 2025, but Scholz said his party was pressing for guarantees that would continue through the 2030s.
Doing so, he said, was the best insurance Germany could muster to prevent further increases in support for populist parties.
""Globalization and digitalisation create wealth, but they are also changing our world at a rapid pace. Our citizens expect, appropriately, that we do everything possible to ensure that they can still live well,"" he told the newspaper.
""Stable pensions will prevent a German Trump,"" he said, in a reference to the anti-establishment wave that swept U.S. President Donald Trump into power in 2016.
If Merkel's conservative bloc refused to agree to keep pensions stable through to 2040, the issue would become the focus of a major political fight, Scholz said.
""Then the citizens will decide this issue with their ballots,"" he said.
Germany faces its next national election in 2021, but several states - including Bavaria - go to the polls in the interim.
A new poll conducted for the Bild am Sonntag showed that the conservatives had lost one percentage point to poll at 30 percent, while the SPD was steady at 17 percent. That means that if Germany voted again tomorrow, the grand coalition would not have enough support to govern.

The poll, conducted by the Emnid institute, showed the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party gaining one point to 15 percent, and the pro-business Free Democrats adding one point to poll at 9 percent.

1073,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>",Second cardinal withdraws from Ireland congress amid abuse scandals,"By Padraic Halpin
DUBLIN (Reuters) - The Archbishop of Washington, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, withdrew on Saturday from next week's World Meeting of Families in Dublin, the second senior cleric to pull out of the Roman Catholic event amid clerical sexual abuse scandals in the United States.
The meeting, a major congress held every three years, will be closed by Pope Francis during the first papal visit in almost 40 years to Ireland where a series of abuse scandals has also rocked the church's standing in the once staunchly Catholic country. 
The withdrawal from the Dublin event followed a bombshell grand jury report this week that detailed widespread abuse by hundreds of priests in Pennsylvania and a systematic cover-up campaign by their bishops over a 70-year period.
Wuerl, who was Bishop for the Diocese of Pittsburgh in western Pennsylvania from 1988 to 2006, has not himself been accused of any wrongdoing against children.
The report found that Wuerl notified the Vatican in 1989 of several priests who had been accused of sexually abusing children but that over subsequent years he granted requests by some to be reassigned to other parishes or to retire early, and in one case approved a loan to assist one such priest with personal debts.
In a statement on Tuesday, Wuerl said that while he understood the report may be critical of some of his actions, he believed it ""confirmed that he acted with diligence, with concern for the victims and to prevent future acts of abuse."" 
A spokeswoman for the World Meeting of Families said she could confirm that Cardinal Wuerl would no longer be attending the Dublin event. No reason was provided. 
In the most wide-ranging U.S. investigation into sexual abuse by priests since the scandal burst into the public eye in Boston in 2002, the two-year Pennsylvania investigation found evidence that at least 1,000 people, mostly children, had been sexually abused by some 300 clergymen. 
The report said the numbers of actual victims and abusers could be much higher. 

The Archbishop of Boston, Cardinal Sean O'Malley, who was due to host a panel discussion on safeguarding children at the congress, withdrew earlier this week to oversee an investigation into separate allegations of inappropriate behavior at a Boston seminary.

IPIALES, Colombia (Reuters) - Tears welled up in Gabriel Malavolta's eyes on Saturday as he realized his dream of a new life in Peru was over, at least for now.
The 50-year-old mechanic fled Venezuela three days ago. He had hoped to make the overland crossing into Ecuador and then on to Lima, saying the deepening economic crisis in his homeland had left him without the basic means of survival. 
Traveling by bus with his fiance Yenny to the border town of Ipiales in southwest Colombia, Malavolta said he heard on the final leg of the trip that their plan had been ruined. 
As of 12 a.m. on Saturday, new regulations put in place by Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno prohibit Venezuelans from entering Ecuador without a valid passport. Previously, they could enter with no other document than their national ID cards.
Malavolta has a passport, but his fiancee only has an ID card. They arrived at the Rumichaca border crossing outside Ipiales just six hours after the new regulation took effect.
""I don't know what we're going to do, but we can't go back. I'm not sending my fiancee to go back and go hungry,"" he said as he sat in a Red Cross tent in Ipiales.
""You've no idea what it's like, whole families eat from the trash,"" he said of the desperate situation back home.
More than a million Venezuelan migrants have entered Colombia over the last 15 months, according to official estimates, but Ecuador has also received many refugees until now.
About 300 Venezuelans were lined up at the border crossing early on Saturday. Like Malavolta's fiancee, many indicated they had no passports to gain entry to Ecuador.
Peru's government announced immigration measures similar to Ecuador's on Friday, with passport requirements for Venezuelans beginning on Aug. 25.
In Ipiales, Venezuelan mirgrants who said they had hitchhiked for days were huddled under blankets in tents when a team of Reuters arrived there late on Friday. Exhausted and hungry from their travels, some had scraped a few pesos together to buy food. 
""I understand why Ecuador's doing this, it's for security, but we have to understand this is a particular phenomenon, given Venezuela isn't issuing IDs to people leaving the country,” Jorge Enrique Quiñónez, deputy representative of UNICEF Ecuador, told Reuters. 
Over the last two years, especially, many Venezuelans have struggled to obtain passports amid the OPEC nation's political and economic chaos. Waiting in line for her passport to be stamped, 43-year-old Berta Casteñada, a Venezuelan math teacher, said she knew people who had been waiting for the prized documents for years.
""It takes forever,"" she said.
Sitting on the floor outside a public toilet with her head in her hands, Adrianil Blanco sobbed. 
She said she had spent two weeks hitchhiking and walking to reach the Rumichaca crossing. Her tattered canvas shoes were a testament to hardship.
Blanco had arrived at the border at 11 p.m., with an hour to spare. She said she had no passport and her national ID card, a piece of laminated paper, was damaged so Ecuadorian border officials would not accept it. 
""They don't understand what it was like getting here. We got wet, we were sleeping on the streets,"" she said.
Christian Kruger, head of Colombia's migration authority, said on Friday Colombia has been bending the rules on migration issues to give a ""helping hand"" to Venezuelans.
""We're taking about 3,000 people a day. If they start to accumulate we'll see a large population around this area."" 
He did not elaborate, but a buildup of refugees in and around Ipiales now seems unavoidable.

This year alone, 423,000 Venezuelans have entered Ecuador through the Rumichaca border. But for Blanco, Malavolta and his fiance, the lack of passports means having to look elsewhere to make a new start.

Putin arrived in a car carrying a bouquet of flowers and accompanied, local media said, by a troupe of Cossack singers booked to serenade the newlyweds. He was on a stopover on his way to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel outside Berlin. 
Photographs showed Kneissl, 53, smiling in a long white and cream ""dirndl"" dress and talking to Putin as they danced in a vineyard in southern Styria province, the venue of her wedding to entrepreneur Wolfgang Meilinger. Putin - who made a toast in German at the wedding, according to the Kremlin - was pictured listening to her intently.
The invitation surprised many in Vienna and Moscow, particularly at a time when the European Union is at odds with Russia over its annexation of the Crimea region from Ukraine, and other issues.
""It was a nice trip,"" Putin said ahead of the talks with Merkel. ""It was a private visit.""
There have been no reports that Kneissl - a polyglot Middle East expert without political affiliation - has a particularly close friendship with Putin. But she was appointed to her job by the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) which has a cooperation agreement with Putin's United Russia party.
FPO leader and Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache has expressed support for Russia and called for sanctions against Moscow to be lifted.
""SYMBOLIC AND HARMFUL""
Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and his conservatives, who control Austria's EU policy, have said Austria will toe the EU line - though they have also pointed to Austria's history of neutrality and its relatively warm relations with Russia. Kurz also attended the wedding.
Strache, who joined Austria's governing coalition last year, praised Kneissl on Saturday as a ""bridge builder"" as he congratulated the married couple and wished them ""all the luck in the world and eternal love!""
The international coverage of Putin's visit would bring priceless publicity, he added. ""A better advertisement for Austria, its wonderful nature, dreamlike landscape and real life hospitality cannot exist!""
Joerg Leichtfried from the opposition Social Democrats tweeted that Austria's current presidency of the Council of the European Union put it in an especially delicate spot given tensions between Putin and the West.
""All the more symbolic and harmful to court the Russian president in this manner,"" he said.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian news agencies that Moscow rejected the criticism regarding Putin's presence at the wedding. 
Putin travelled to Germany later on Saturday to meet Chancellor Angela Merkel for talks about Syria, Ukraine, and energy matters. 
Austria did not follow other members of the EU earlier this year in expelling Russian diplomats after Britain accused the Kremlin of involvement in the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in England - a charge Moscow denies.

Putin visited Austria in June on his first trip to the West after being re-elected as president.

Many of the far-right activists, clad in red and white, hoisted the red, white and black flag of Hitler's Third Reich. One group carried a sign that proclaimed, ""I regret nothing: National Socialists Berlin."" 
""There were reports of injuries when some stones and bottles were thrown by counter demonstrators at the far-right demonstrators,"" Berlin police spokesman Thilo Cablitz told Reuters. ""At least one police officer was injured. But the event is still going on and we're still compiling the numbers.""
About 2,300 police officers were on duty to prevent violence at the Berlin event and a separate march by less than 50 people in the Berlin suburb of Spandau, where Hess, a former deputy of Germany's wartime dictator Adolf Hitler, served a life sentence handed down at the Nuremberg war crimes trials.
A broad mix of counter demonstrators staged non-violent sit-ins at intersections along the march route in the Berlin neighborhood of Lichtenberg, while others gathered to shout at the neo-Nazi demonstrators. 
Germany has tough laws that ban use of symbols of the Nazi regime, such as the swastika flag, but the far-right has grown stronger in recent years after the arrival of more than a million mostly Muslim migrants beginning in 2015.
While far-right activity remains a fringe phenomenon in Germany, it has been behind high-profile crimes, most recently 10 murders committed by the so-called National Socialist Underground (NSU), whose sole surviving leader was sentenced to life in prison in July.
The clashes took place about 65 km (40 miles) south of the town of Meseberg, where Chancellor Angela Merkel is meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday evening.

Buhari, flying home from London, is campaigning to win a second term in February elections. Although the main opposition party is yet to pick a candidate, the president's ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has been beset by a series of high-profile defections.

After Buhari spent five months in Britain last year being treated for an undisclosed ailment, opposition critics said he was unfit for office and his administration was beset by inertia.

Since then, leaves of absence have sparked chatter about the president's health, though Buhari's gaunt appearance through much of 2017 has visibly improved.

The incident is the latest in a series of killings and bombings in the southern city, the temporary headquarters of the internationally recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who was expelled from the capital Sanaa in 2014 by the armed Houthi group.
One academy officer said southern separatist forces fighting alongside a Saudi-led coalition against the Houthis had opened fire from their mountain base across from the academy.
""When the graduation ceremony began they opened fire with machine guns because the academy had flown the unification flag of Yemen,"" he told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Another witness said two people had been injured and that the ceremony was moved inside, and cut short. 
The rising tension between the southern separatists, who are allied with the United Arab Emirates, and Hadi's government comes ahead of U.N.-sponsored consultations between the warring Yemeni parties next month in a bid to end the more than three-year-old conflict.
The UAE and Saudi Arabia are leading a Sunni Muslim Arab coalition that intervened in Yemen's war in 2015 to unseat the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement and restore Hadi's government.

1080,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2018 12:51PM ET</span>",Trans students: A test of identity for U.S. girls schools,"By Tea Kvetenadze
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Secondary schools for girls across the United States are grappling with a difficult and increasingly common question: what is the best approach when a student or applicant no longer identifies as female or is going through a gender transition?
As students who are openly transgender or non-binary - those who identify as neither male nor female - have become more visible at girls schools in recent years, educators are re-defining policies on admission, retention and other issues.
The challenge, experts say, is to create policies that support and respect students while preserving the historic mission of these schools to educate and empower young women in exclusively female environments.
But many schools have yet to clarify policies related to gender identity, and that could keep some students from being open about their gender expression, said Joanne Glusman, president of the Main Line Youth Alliance, who works with adolescents who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer. 
""There are certainly kids who don't feel safe or comfortable coming out in their single-sex school,"" Glusman said.
Studies have shown transgender youth are often bullied and are more at risk of depression, anxiety, and suicide, among other mental health concerns, than their non-trans peers.
A study by the University of Minnesota published in the journal Pediatrics found that almost 3 percent of 9th through 12th graders identified as transgender or gender-nonconforming, a term used to describe those who don't conform to traditional gender conventions. On that basis, hundreds if not thousands of trans and non-binary students likely attend the about 375 girls schools in the United States, though no precise count exists. 
""Middle school and high school, that's when you really start learning more about yourself and growing,"" said Ezra Morales, 18, a trans, gender non-conforming activist who recently graduated from the Ann Richards School For Girls in Austin. 
Among the dozens of girls schools contacted by Reuters, several said they had already developed transgender policies, some said they are having early discussions or have created taskforces and a number of others have taken no action.
Many schools said they decide on a case-by-case basis whether a non-binary or transgender student who no longer identifies as a girl will stay, either as a matter of policy or in anticipation of more specific guidelines.
That approach is in keeping with recommendations from a National Coalition of Girls' Schools taskforce that educators make such decisions on ""an individual basis,"" rather than codifying rigid policies.
But making case-by-case decisions can present problems due to the conscious or unconscious biases of administrators, according to Davey Shlasko, founder of Think Again, which trains schools on issues such as trans inclusion. That raises questions about basic fairness and could put a school in legal jeopardy, he said.
Several schools, including the prestigious Marlborough School in Los Angeles and Nightingale-Bamford on Manhattan's Upper East Side, have policies considering any applicant who identifies as female, including those assigned male at birth.
When it comes to retaining transitioning students who are already enrolled, Nightingale is ""very much taking the case-by-case position,"" said Head of School Paul Burke. 
With enrolled students who identify as male or gender-nonconforming, he said Nightingale prefers to have a dialogue to make sure the school is still the best environment for them. 
In recent years, Nightingale and other schools have made more trans-inclusive accommodations such as dropping the tradition of students wearing white dresses at graduation, a practice that Burke described as ""clearly gendered.""
'WE'RE NOT THERE YET'
But there are some girls schools that have not developed policies despite having openly trans or non-binary students. 
The National Cathedral School, an Episcopal day school in Washington D.C., has no formal policy even though they've had students transition in the past. ""We're not there yet,"" said Scott Butterworth, the school's director of communications.
Stoneleigh-Burnham in Massachusetts, Carrollton School of the Sacred Heart in Miami and Kent Place in New Jersey also have no formal transgender protocols but say they are discussing the issue. 
Brearley, an exclusive private New York day school, said in its gender diversity statement it would accept any female-identifying applicant and work with and support transitioning pupils, including accommodating their choice of name and pronoun. They will, however, continue to refer to students en masse as ""girls"" or ""young women.""
Marlborough adopted practices two years ago for those who no longer identify as female: it allows students in 12th grade to graduate and treats 11th graders on a case-by-case basis, but younger students are asked to switch schools.
The school concedes that its practices could very well change in the future, however, as its thinking about the issue evolves.

""We're never going to be static,"" said Head of School Priscilla Sands. ""We're never going to say: 'That's what we wrote in 2016 and that's what it will be forever.'""

BIRQASH, Egypt (Reuters) - Muslims often slaughter sheep at the annual Eid al-Adha ""feast of the sacrifice"" which falls next week, but some Egyptians are thinking bigger.
Wealthier customers are flocking to the Birqash market, northwest of Cairo, where traders from across east Africa bring animals for auction - not sheep, but camels.
""This camel market is the biggest in the world ... it is the only one that still operates by word of honor, without paper,"" said camel trader Faraj al-Gammal, 50.
""Any businessman who comes from abroad, bringing in ... camels, knows he is safe and secure here.""
Buyers inspect camels that limp around on three hoofs, the fourth tied at the knee to restrict their movement. 
Many are sold at prices ranging from 15,000 Egyptian pounds ($840) to 40,000 pounds, while some fetch as much as 65,000. Sheep sell for as little as 3,000 pounds.
One trader pointed out that camels were reared more naturally than cattle or sheep.
""Cattle get hormone injections to increase their weight, but camels don't,"" said Azmi Mansour.
Used mostly for desert transport, camels also provide Bedouin with milk, meat and hair to weave into clothing.
Eid al-Adha commemorates Islam's version of the biblical story of God's testing of Abraham's faith by commanding him to sacrifice his son.

Meat from the animals slaughtered for Eid is traditionally shared with the poor.

1083,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2018 11:51AM ET</span>",Former U.N. chief and Nobel peace laureate Kofi Annan dies aged 80,"By Kwasi Kpodo and Stephanie Nebehay
ACCRA/GENEVA (Reuters) - Former U.N. Secretary-General and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Kofi Annan died on Saturday at the age of 80, his foundation said, after decades of championing efforts to try to end protracted conflicts in Africa, Asia and the Middle East.
Annan, a Ghanaian national, died in hospital in Bern, Switzerland, in the early hours, his close associates said.
In Geneva, the Kofi Annan Foundation announced his peaceful death after a short undisclosed illness with ""immense sadness"", saying he was surrounded in his last days by his second wife Nane and children Ama, Kojo and Nina.
After rising through the ranks of the United Nations, Annan served two terms as U.N. Secretary-General in New York from 1997-2006 and retired to live in a Swiss village in the Geneva countryside. His 10-year-old foundation promotes good governance and the transformation of African agriculture.
""In many ways, Kofi Annan was the United Nations. He rose through the ranks to lead the organization into the new millennium with matchless dignity and determination,"" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, whom Annan had chosen to head the U.N. refugee agency, said in a statement.
Annan and the United Nations shared the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize for efforts to reform the world body and give priority to human rights issues.
As head of U.N. peacekeeping operations, Annan was criticized for the world body's failure to halt the genocide in Rwanda in the 1990s. 
As U.N. boss he was linked to peace efforts to reunite the divided island of Cyprus, submitting a reunification blueprint which was rejected in a referendum by Greek Cypriots in 2004.
'NOT PERFECT' 
He staunchly opposed the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and later served as the first U.N. envoy at the start of Syria's war, but quit after world powers failed to fulfill their commitments, saying: ""I lost my troops on the way to Damascus"".
""The U.N. can be improved, it is not perfect but if it didn't exist you would have to create it,"" he told the BBC's Hard Talk during an interview for his 80th birthday in April, recorded at the Geneva Graduate Institute where he had studied.
""I am a stubborn optimist, I was born an optimist and will remain an optimist,"" added Annan, who often joked about having learned from locals to wear earmuffs against the freezing cold during his undergraduate years at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, in the United States. 
Raila Odinga, Kenyan opposition leader and former prime minister, said on Citizen TV: ""We didn't expect Kofi to pass that abruptly. Kofi Annan is a man of integrity; a great African, a great leader of the world.""
Former U.S. presidents praised Annan.
George W. Bush called him ""a gentle man and a tireless leader of the United Nations"", while Barack Obama described him as ""a diplomat and humanitarian who embodied the mission of the United Nations like few others"". 
""Kofi Annan devoted his life to making the world a more peaceful place through his compassion and dedication to service. He worked tirelessly to unite us and never stopped fighting for the dignity of every‎ person,"" U.S. envoy to the U.N. Nikki Haley said. 
The Elders, a group of former leaders including Gro Harlem Brundtland and Mary Robinson, paid tribute to their inspiring chairman, noting his visits to South Africa and Zimbabwe in July.
U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, paid tribute to Annan as ""humanity’s best example, the epitome, of human decency and grace"".
Zeid, who has criticized major powers and other countries during his four-year term that ends later this month, said that whenever he felt ""isolated and alone politically"", he would go for long walks with Annan in Geneva.
""When I told him once how everyone was grumbling about me, he looked at me — like a father would look at a son — and said sternly: ""You’re doing the right thing, let them grumble."" Then he grinned!""

Abderrahman Bouanane, a failed Moroccan asylum seeker who had seen himself as a soldier for Islamic State, stabbed two women to death and wounded eight other people in Turku's main square on Aug. 18, 2017.
About 300 supporters of the Nordic Resistance Movement, a far-right group the Finnish intelligence service says aims to create a national socialist state, marched through the city center on Saturday waving flags. 
The counter rally, with about 1,000 demonstrators, shouted ""No Nazis in Turku, no Nazis anywhere!""
The groups traded insults and bananas were thrown at the far-right group. The police kept the demonstrations apart and arrested 10 people.
The Nordic Resistance Movement was banned last year by a Finnish court but it is still allowed to demonstrate while it awaits the outcome of an appeal.
No official commemoration of last year's attack was held.
""A tragic crime or its perpetrator do not deserve a commemoration day. We respect victims... by working every day for safety, mutual understanding between cultures and improving social integration of immigrants,"" Turku mayor Minna Arve said in a statement.
In June, Bouanane was sentenced to life in prison.
Many Finns have called for tighter immigration rules after the attack. The center-right government has urged parliament to fast-track a bill that would give authorities new powers to monitor citizens online.
Some officials have also promoted establishing better-controlled ""return centers"" to monitor more closely those who have been denied asylum.

""It is a critical moment for our economy, but we are not in a dead end,"" Vice President Eshagh Jahangiri was quoted as saying by the state news agency IRNA.
""This country has plenty of human and natural resources that can rely on."" 
""The size of our oil and gas resources is number one in the world. In minerals and metals we are among the top 10 countries,” Jahangiri said.
Washington has withdrawn from a deal that had lifted sanctions on Tehran in return for curbs on its nuclear program.
Sanctions imposed in August target Iran’s trade in gold and other precious metals, its purchases of U.S. dollars and its car industry.
U.S. President Donald Trump has said a new round of sanctions will be imposed in November, targeting Iranian oil sales.
Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei last week rejected Trump’s offer of talks.

Iran's rial currency has lost about half of its value since April, driven mainly by heavy demand for dollars among ordinary Iranians trying to protect their savings.

Mohammad Ali Taheri, founder of Erfan Halgheh, which calls itself “Interuniversalism” in English, was arrested in 2011 and charged with “insulting Islamic sanctities” and “spreading corruption on earth”.
Taheri was sentenced to death by a Revolutionary Court in 2015, but acquitted on appeal in 2016. The court then re-imposed the death sentence in 2017, but the five-year sentence replaces it.
His lawyer, Mahmoud Alizadeh Tabatabaei, told the semi-official news agency he would lodge an appeal against the five-year sentence, but added: ""We are hopeful that they would release Taheri this week as promised, since he has already served half of his sentence.""
Taheri founded Erfan Halgheh after receiving what he claims were “spiritual inspirations” that empowered him to connect with a larger “cosmic consciousness”. 
He practised his beliefs, along with his thousands of followers, in “healing sessions” often involving alternative medicine. 
He has spent most of his arrest in solitary confinement, according to human rights activists.
Taheri has gone on several hunger strikes in protest at his detention, lack of access to his family and lawyer, and repeated death threats against him and his family. 
Amnesty International says he is a prisoner of conscience, targeted for the ""peaceful exercise of his rights to freedoms of belief, expression and association"".
Iranian authorities dismiss such criticism as part of an effort by the West to put political pressure on the Islamic Republic.

Rajaonarimampianina's agent submitted his application to the High Constitutional Court on Friday afternoon, while Ravalomana sent in his on Saturday.
""It's here, if you remember, that we started five years ago, in August. The story started here, and we will continue it here because you ask for it,"" Rajaonarimampianina said during a ceremony at a hotel in Antananarivo.

Rajoelina has also submitted an application.
The 2009 coup prompted an exodus of foreign investors from Madagascar, which remains one of the world's poorest countries despite reserves of nickel, cobalt, gold, uranium and other minerals.
The island's latest political crisis was sparked in April by a legal amendment that would have prevented Ravalomanana from standing for office.
In May, Rajaonarimampianina approved a new law removing that provision, and the Constitutional Court ordered him to dissolve his government and appoint a new prime minister with the support of all parties.
Sarah Ravalomanana, the daughter to Marc Ravalomanana, submitted his papers on Saturday.

MECCA, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Hisham Mostafa briefly forgot the war in Syria and his financial worries as he looked upon Islam's holiest sites for the first time, standing among hundreds of thousands of white-clad Muslims gathered in Mecca ahead of the haj pilgrimage.
""This is the first time I see the Grand Mosque and the Kaaba. It is the best feeling of my life to be able to perform the haj,"" said Mostafa, 50, as he looked at the cube-shaped structure towards which Muslims turn in prayer five times a day.
The accountant traveled to Saudi Arabia from Turkey where he has lived for five years since fleeing Aleppo in Syria. ""War destroys everything ... Life in Turkey is hard and I barely earn enough.""
But he was able to join about 2 million Muslims, including 1.68 million from abroad, flooding Mecca's narrow streets for the annual rite which starts on Sunday.
Nayef Ahmed, 37, told Reuters that in order to afford the haj he had to sell a plot of land in Yemen, which is embroiled in a three-year proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
""Because of the war the prices are very high. But being here I feel comfort and peace and I pray to God for the war to end.""
Saudi Arabia stakes its reputation on its guardianship of Islam's holiest sites and organising a peaceful haj, which has been marred in the past by deadly stampedes, fires and riots. 
The interior ministry has put in place measures to confront any security threat from militant attacks to political protests, but no specific threats have been detected, a spokesman said. 
""We will prevent any actions that are not part of the haj ritual and any act that may impact the safety of pilgrims or their ability to perform the rite,"" Interior Ministry spokesman Mansour Turki told Reuters.
Every able-bodied Muslim who has the means should perform the haj at least once in their lifetime under a quota system.
""I came for umrah (minor pilgrimage) in 2007 and today after 10 years of registering and waiting, I am here,"" said Najwa, 59, from Tunisia. ""I cannot describe the feeling. I cry every day.""
The haj itinerary retraces the route Prophet Mohammad took 14 centuries ago. Saudi Arabia has made use of technology to manage the flow of millions at the same place at the same time.
This includes electronic identification bracelets, connected to GPS, that were introduced after a 2015 crush killed hundreds.
""There is a comprehensive electronic agenda for every pilgrim and we have provided many apps that offer guidance,"" Minister of Haj and Umrah Mohammed Bintin told Reuters.
""We have a fleet of more than 18,000 buses, all of them linked to a control system that tracks their path.""
He said a high speed railway between Mecca and Medina had been completed and was being now being tested. 
Pilgrimage is the backbone of a plan to expand tourism under a drive to diversify the kingdom's economy away from oil. The haj and year-round umrah generate billions of dollars in revenues from worshippers' lodging, transport, fees and gifts.

Officials aim to increase the number of umrah and haj pilgrims to 15 million and 5 million respectively by 2020, and hope to double the umrah number again to 30 million by 2030.

1089,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>",U.S. missionary thrust to the center of Turkey-U.S. crisis,"By Ezgi Erkoyun and Humeyra Pamuk
IZMIR, Turkey (Reuters) - When Andrew Brunson saw a police summons on his door in late summer 2016, the U.S. evangelical pastor thought it was a routine appointment to sort out his residency papers in Turkey, his home for nearly a quarter of a century.
He went to the police station on Oct. 7, 2016, was detained and later charged with involvement in a coup attempt. He is still in detention and is now at the center of a diplomatic row that has fueled Turkey's most serious currency crisis for almost two decades.
""Obviously he was more than surprised"" to be detained, Brunson's lawyer, Ismail Cem Halavurt, told Reuters in an interview on Friday.
Brunson lived and preached in Izmir, a city on Turkey's Aegean coast near some of the sites of Christianity's first communities. At his first hearing in April, attended by Reuters, Brunson said he was ""raising disciples for Jesus"" in a country he deeply loved.
In July, after nearly two years in prison, Brunson was moved to house arrest. A court on Friday rejected an appeal to release him, saying evidence was still being collected and he posed a flight risk, according to a copy of the ruling seen by Reuters.
U.S. President Donald Trump has demanded Brunson's unconditional release, describing him as a ""great patriot hostage"", and has slapped sanctions and tariffs on Turkey which have helped push the lira currency to record lows.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has linked Brunson's release to the fate of Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish Muslim cleric living in the United States whom he blames for the July 2016 coup attempt. Erdogan has raised tariffs on U.S. cars, alcohol and tobacco in a tit-for-tat response.
""You have one pastor as well. Give him (Gulen) to us... Then we will try him (Brunson) and give him to you,"" Erdogan said in a speech last September to police officers in Ankara. It is a suggestion Washington has dismissed. 
The breakdown in relations between the two NATO allies has thrust Brunson's case to international prominence and made the 50-year-old American the unlikely center of attention in a currency crisis that has shaken global emerging markets.
Turkish courts have rejected several appeals for Brunson to be freed and allowed to leave Turkey. A senior Turkish official, asked about the case, said that the judiciary is independent and the verdict is up to the courts.
Halavurt, Brunson's lawyer, said the North Carolina pastor was not unduly alarmed when he first went to the police station. He expected at worst to be given a two-week deadline to leave the country - standard practice with residency violations - and to return to Turkey when his papers were sorted out. 
Instead, he was held in a detention center for two months before being formally arrested on Dec. 9, 2016.
He was charged with crimes committed on behalf of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a Kurdish militant group which has waged a three-decade insurgency against the Turkish state, and on behalf of Gulen's network, according to the indictment seen by Reuters. Both are designated terrorist groups by Ankara.
He was also charged with disclosing state information ""for political or military espionage"". 
Brunson has denied all the charges against him.
SECRET WITNESSES
His indictment, interviews with his lawyer, and three trial sessions attended by Reuters show the accusations against Brunson center around support for separatist Kurds and connections with alleged coup plotters.
""I came to Turkey in 1993 to tell people about Jesus,"" he told the judge at his first hearing in April. Dressed in a black suit and white shirt, he spoke in fluent Turkish, ignoring the two court translators.
""I've never done something secretive in my time in Turkey. The government monitored us all the time but I've never done anything against Turkey,"" he said.
The judge told Brunson he was not on trial for carrying out missionary activities but to face the charges against him.
Prosecutors questioned why he traveled hundreds of miles from his church on Turkey's western coast to the mainly Kurdish southeast interior, where the PKK is active.
Messages on his phones, travel details, testimony from his congregation and what the indictment refers to as three secret witnesses, codenamed ""Prayer"", ""Fire"" and ""Meteor"", were cited in evidence against him.
The indictment cites GPS data showing trips to Suruc, near the Syrian border, and the mainly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir, as well as a meeting in 2010 with a man described by one of the secret witnesses as a U.S. special forces soldier.
Brunson said his trips to Kurdish areas were to help refugees who had escaped war in neighboring Syria.
""I do not accept that I acted in accordance with PKK targets ... We wanted to convert Syrian refugees coming to Izmir. I do not differentiate between their ethnic identities,"" he said.
""Prayer"", the secret witness, was quoted in the indictment as saying Brunson was linked to prominent suspected members of Gulen's network.
Halavurt said the witness had failed to offer concrete evidence of any such connections.
The prosecution said in its indictment that Brunson's phone records and witness testimony did establish the connections.
Turkey has detained 160,000 people since the abortive putsch, almost half of them formally charged and kept in jail during their trials. 
Brunson was not in the country at the time of the coup attempt but returned soon afterwards, according to his lawyer. In a text message cited in the indictment, he said the coup attempt ""was a shock"".
""We were waiting for some events that would shake the Turks - preparing the conditions for Jesus' return ... I think the situation is going to get worse. We'll win in the end,"" said the message, which was dated July 21, 2016 and addressed to a fellow pastor, according to the indictment.
Brunson did not deny sending the message but said it had been misunderstood, the indictment said.
""WE DIDN'T KNOW HIM"" 
In the Alsancak district of Izmir where Brunson lived, a pharmacy owner described him and his wife as ""quiet people"".
The owner of a boutique two streets from his home said she never met him. ""I know everyone in this neighborhood and I had no idea these people lived here,"" she said.
Turkey's government says it was similarly unaware of Brunson until his case was raised by the U.S. consulate. 
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said this month that the case was triggered by a criminal complaint filed by a translator who had worked for Brunson and denied that the pastor had been detained for use as a political pawn.
""What possible benefit could we get from this person,"" Cavusoglu said at a meeting of Turkey's ruling party in the southern coastal town of Alanya.
The senior Turkish official said negotiations had been held with U.S. counterparts ""in different formats"" but declined to comment further. 
At a NATO summit in Brussels last month, Trump and Erdogan discussed Brunson. Trump thought he and his Turkish counterpart had agreed a deal to release the U.S. pastor, according to two U.S. sources.
Turkey has denied any such swap was agreed upon. 
Erdogan had sought U.S. help to persuade Israeli authorities to release a Turkish woman being held in Israel, accused of ties to the Palestinian militant group Hamas. In exchange, Ankara would release Brunson , a senior White House official said.
Israel deported the Turkish detainee, Ebru Ozkan, on July 15 and later confirmed that Trump had requested her release. Ankara has denied ever agreeing to free Brunson in return.
Brunson's transfer to house arrest 10 days later was deemed too little, too late by Washington and a phone call between the two leaders on July 26 ""did not go well"", according to the U.S. official. 
Hours later, Trump announced sanctions against two Turkish government ministers.
""They should have given him back a long time ago, and Turkey has in my opinion acted very, very badly,"" Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday, referring to Brunson.

Brunson's next court hearing is scheduled for October.

Lukashenko named Sergei Rumas, the head of the country's Development Bank, as new prime minister, the presidential press service said in a statement. Rumas replaces Andrei Kobyakov, who had served as Belarus' prime minister since 2014.

Both Moody's and Standard & Poor's ratings agencies cut Turkey's sovereign credit ratings deeper into ""junk"" territory late on Friday. 
Standard & Poor's cited extreme lira volatility and forecasted a recession next year. The rating agency downgraded the rating by one notch to B+ from BB- and kept Turkey's outlook at stable in a move which came after the lira lost some 40 percent of its value against the dollar this year.
""Today some people are trying to threaten us through the economy, through interest rates, foreign exchange, investment and inflation,"" Erdogan told the congress of his ruling AK Party.
""We are telling them: we've seen your games, and we are challenging you."" 
The lira has plunged as investors fret about Erdogan's influence over monetary policy.
Heavy selling in recent weeks has spread to other emerging market currencies and global stocks and deepened concerns about the economy, particularly Turkey's dependence on energy imports and whether foreign-currency debt poses a risk to banks.
On Friday, Turkey's battered lira weakened 3 percent after a Turkish court rejected an American pastor's appeal for release, drawing a stiff rebuke from President Donald Trump, who said the United States would not take the detention ""sitting down"".
The case of Andrew Brunson, an evangelical Christian missionary from North Carolina who has lived in Turkey for two decades, has become a flashpoint between Washington and Ankara and accelerated a widening currency crisis.

""We did not and will not surrender to those who act like a strategic partner but make us a strategic target,"" Erdogan said, in a reference to the United States.

GENOA (Reuters) - Italy mourned the victims of the collapse of a motorway bridge in the northern city of Genoa with a state funeral on Saturday, as rescue workers kept searching for the last few unaccounted people buried in the rubble.
On Tuesday a 200-metre section of the Morandi bridge in Genoa gave way in busy lunchtime traffic, killing at least 38 people.
The mass for 19 of the victims was held at the Exhibition and Trade Centre of the northern port city and led by the city's archbishop, Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco.
But some of the victims' families boycotted the event and held their own private services, as a protest against the state, seen as negligent in its role of overseeing safety on the privately run bridge.
A car was found on Saturday morning by rescue workers under slabs of concrete. The fire brigade and the Genoa prefecture said it was ""compatible"" with one believed to carry a family of three. But the official death toll has not yet been revised. 
The government has declared Saturday a national day of mourning and declared a state of emergency for Genoa, one of Italy's largest ports. 
Members of the fire brigade, rescue teams and the police force were welcomed with applause as they entered the exhibition center, where the caskets, including a small white one for a child, were lined up in front of a temporary altar.
""These things should not happen but unfortunately they still do. Now they're looking for someone to blame but dead people cannot come back,"" said Giuseppe Rondinelli, a friend of one of the victims, who was among the mourners. 
Players of the city's two soccer teams, Genoa and Sampdoria, sat among the crowd, having refused to play matches this weekend in sign of respect. Relatives of the dead stood beside the coffins, adorned with white and yellow roses, some with their hands on the caskets.
Albanian flags were draped over two caskets and the Chilean flag on two others. Another was covered with soccer memorabilia. 
""The collapse of the bridge was a gash in the heart of Genoa, it's a deep wound,"" the archbishop said in his homily. 
Italy's head of state, President Sergio Mattarella, and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte attended the ceremony as well as Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli.
A Genoa court will try to establish the exactly why the 51 year-old bridge collapsed, but experts said problems with concrete-encased cable stays were a possible cause.
The disaster has dragged toll-road operator Autostrade per l'Italia (ASPI), controlled by infrastructure group Atlantia, into a political storm. The firm manages the section of the A10 motorway linking Genoa to the French border. 
""Now it is the time of grief.. but we must think about the conditions of the roads of our region and the security of our infrastructure because these victims cannot be followed by other victims,"" Ilaria Caprioglio, the mayor of the town of Savona, said ahead of the ceremony. 
REVOKING CONCESSIONS
Italy's populist ruling coalition on Friday launched a formal procedure aimed at revoking concessions held by Autostrade to operate toll highways.
""Evidently someone did not do their job well in terms of ordinary and extraordinary maintenance. The concessionaire has faults that appear very grave,"" Toninelli said in an interview with La Stampa, adding that it was up to investigators to establish who was responsible.
The Transport Ministry has given Autostrade 15 days to show it has met all its contractual obligations, failing which Rome could consider it in breach of the terms of its concessions. 
Toninelli said he would deploy all necessary resources to avoid further disasters and said he was preparing contingencies in case the concessions were revoked.
Autostrade, which operates 3,000 km of motorways in Italy, said on Saturday it would hold a news conference in Genoa after the funerals, the company's first public appearance since the disaster. 
The group's chairman and chief executive officer would outline initiatives to support victims' families and those evacuated from their homes, as well as efforts to help traffic flow in the city, Autostrade added in a statement.

KOCHI, India (Reuters) - India deployed thousands of soldiers and dozens of helicopters to rescue people marooned by the worst floods in a century in the southern state of Kerala, where the death toll of 186 people as of Saturday could rise fast as rains continue.
The weather office warned of more heavy ""red"" category rains on Saturday as tens of thousands of people were still stuck on the rooftops of houses and community centers. Rescue workers have yet to reach many flooded areas, some too narrow for boats to navigate.
People trapped without food, water and electricity worried about being left without help as their phone batteries were dying. An adviser to the state's chief minister put the initial loss estimate at $4 billion.
""There are seven families in this apartment now. We're safe compared to many others, but we're cut off,"" said James Joseph Moolakkaat, owner of an agricultural business who lives in a 10-story building across the southwestern state's Periyar river. 
""This is my second phone and to save power I have been turning data on and off intermittently. If this goes out, I will have some charge left in my laptop and then it will be incommunicado.""
(For a graphic on 'Kerala underwater' click, https://tmsnrt.rs/2L0MiIw)
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was taken by helicopter over inundated farmland and villages, promised more helicopters, boats and other equipment needed to expand the rescue operation in the still unfolding emergency.
He said the Army, Air Force, Navy and Coast Guard were assisting disaster relief agencies in the rescue, and a total of 38 helicopters had been pressed into service along with a number of aircraft and ships to ferry resources.
""More helicopters, boats and other equipment are being sought and Modi promised to provide all of these as fast as possible,"" Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan told journalists. ""The air marshal in charge of the air operations said more helicopters are on the way.""
According to a lawmaker in Pathanamthitta district, some 10,000 people were stranded and in grave danger unless they were rescued urgently.
A Reuters witness in Aluva town, nearly 250 km (155 miles)from state capital Thiruvananthapuram, said army helicopters airlifted up to 14 marooned residents, including children and elderly people from an apartment.
FOOD SHORTAGES
With hundreds of thousands of people converging in halls and auditoriums of schools, temples, churches, and mosques with little or no toilet facilities, people from less affected areas moved in to help those badly in need.
But some people in the relief camps were finding it difficult to access food and water. Videos on social media showed groups of people breaking open shops to take food.
Chief Minister Vijayan has estimated that more than two million people have been forced to move into relief camps since the monsoon season brought torrential rains three months ago. He put the death toll from floods and landslides since the start of the rainy season at 324.
One of his advisers, Prabha Varma, told Reuters 186 people had died since Aug. 8, when the waters began to rise. She said the floods had destroyed 26,000 homes and damaged crops across as much as 40,000 hectares, with estimated losses of 277 billion rupees.
Modi declared initial assistance of 5 billion rupees ($71 million) and promised more later. He also assured that the federal government would send desperately needed grains, as storage in the state had been flooded and stocks destroyed.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum of the United Arab Emirates, where many Keralites work, said he had formed a committee to extend emergency assistance to the flood victims of the state, whose people he said ""have always been and are still part of our success story"".

1094,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>",Kofi Annan struggled to escape the curse of history,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Kofi Annan, the former United Nations Secretary-General and Nobel Peace Prize laureate who died on Saturday, will be remembered as a dedicated humanitarian whose career was tarnished by ugly conflicts that spun out of control. 
Annan was unable to bring peace to Syria and bring to rest the failures of diplomacy in Rwanda, Bosnia, Darfur, Cyprus, Somalia and Iraq, which are likely to drown out the plaudits for his softly spoken mediation and efforts to eradicate poverty and AIDS that won him the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize.
Annan was brought up in an ethnically divided culture in his native Ghana, but one where dialogue was prized and outright conflict rare. It was a time of optimism and confidence as Ghana headed for independence from Britain.
""He's driven by the idea of 'don't think no', always looking for the best outcome,"" Fred Eckhard, Annan's spokesman during his time as secretary-general, once told Reuters.
His reputation as a mediator was burnished by his success in halting a spiraling conflict in Kenya in 2007, when rival claims to the presidency caused ethnic massacres in which more than 1,200 died.
Annan put the rivals in a room and told them: ""There is only one Kenya"". He helped persuade one of them to accept the post of prime minister in a joint government. The violence ended.
But earlier in his career, Annan's record was less successful. He was head of U.N. peacekeeping in 1994, when he acknowledges he should have done more to help prevent the slaughter of 800,000 Rwandan Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
The greatest reproach was that Annan failed to act on a telegram from the U.N. peacekeeper commander, General Romeo Dallaire, urging a move against arms caches being built up by Hutu extremists as they prepared mass murder.
""I believed at that time that I was doing my best,"" Annan said years later. ""But I realized after the genocide that there was more that I could and should have done to sound the alarm and rally support.""
In a book scathing about the world's failure to act, Dallaire had only praise for Annan, describing his ""humanism and dedication to the plight of others"".
When his U.N. career ended in 2006, he listed his main achievements as establishing the concept of a responsibility to protect civilians when their rulers will not or cannot.
But his tenure was littered with diplomatic disasters. 
BLOODSHED
His worst moments, Annan said, included not being able to stop the bloodshed in Sudan's Darfur, the oil-for-food debacle and the Iraq war, after which he lost his voice for months.
The oil-for-food scandal broke in early 2004 when it emerged that Saddam Hussein had cheated the $64-billion program designed to relieve the pain of U.N. sanctions on the Iraqi people. The sanctions were imposed after Baghdad's troops invaded Kuwait.
While few U.N. officials were accused of enriching themselves, the world body was blamed for lax management and not blowing the whistle on Saddam's tactics. Although Annan was cleared of wrongdoing, his son Kojo was found to have used U.N. contacts to his improper advantage.
Then came the most painful event - the bombing of U.N. headquarters in Baghdad on Aug. 19, 2003, that killed 22 people after Annan had decided, at the urging of the United States, to send senior U.N. staff back to Iraq, including his envoy Sergio Vieira de Mello, who was among the victims.
""It hit me almost as much as the loss of my twin sister,"" Annan told his last news conference as secretary-general, his voice choking. Efua Annan died of an illness in 1991.
Annan was also at the helm at the time of the 1995 Srebrenica massacre in Bosnia, where insufficient U.N. peacekeeping forces again failed to stop the killing, and during a fiasco in Somalia that preceded Rwanda.
His defenders say he tried to get enough troops and the big power support to make a difference in Bosnia and Rwanda. Critics argue that he was held back by respect for the limits he had learned in decades as a U.N. functionary.
At an event in April to mark his 80th birthday, Annan was defensive about his role in Rwanda, joked wryly about being mistaken for actor Morgan Freeman after retiring, and decried a lack of strong leaders to help handle crises.
""We have had difficulties in the past but in some cases leadership has made a difference,"" he said, ending on an upbeat note: ""I am a stubborn optimist, I was born an optimist and will remain an optimist. The moment I lose hope all is lost, I encourage you to keep hope as well.""

RIYADH (Reuters) - Qatar has accused Saudi Arabia of barring its citizens from this year's haj, something Riyadh denies, saying a diplomatic dispute is not stopping Qataris from making the pilgrimage to Mecca.
Although 1,200 Qataris are eligible to perform the haj under a quota system, Qatar says it has become impossible to get permits, blaming the campaign by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt to cut trade and diplomatic ties with the country.
Abdullah Al-Kaabi of the state-run Qatar National Human Rights Committee said Saudi Arabia had shut down an electronic system used by travel agencies to obtain permits for pilgrims from Qatar.
""There is no chance this year for Qatari citizens and residents to travel for haj,"" he told Reuters. ""Registration of pilgrims from the State of Qatar remains closed, and residents of Qatar cannot be granted visas as there are no diplomatic missions.""
A Saudi official said Qatar had blocked several registration links set up for its pilgrims.
An official at Saudi Arabia's haj ministry said a group of Qataris had arrived for the pilgrimage which runs from Sunday to Aug. 24, but he did not say how many there were or whether they had traveled directly from Qatar. Last year, 1,624 Qatari pilgrims attended, he said.
'LOST MONEY' 
Saudi Arabia says the Qatari government is using the issue for political ends and it ""rejects any effort to politicize the haj or drag political differences"" into the pilgrimage, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Saudi Arabia, and the three other Arab countries, closed land, air and sea links with Qatar in June last year, accusing it of funding terrorism, something Doha denies.
Saudi Arabia has said Qatari pilgrims can arrive on any airline other than Qatar Airways. 
But three travel agencies in Doha told Reuters they had stopped trying to sell haj packages, which can cost up to 120,000 riyals ($33,000). 
""Last year we lost a lot of money as the crisis started after we had booked everything in Mecca and Medina and we had to pay people back,"" said a manager of one travel agency in Doha, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
""This year, nobody is really trying as people have understood there is no way to go there in these circumstances."" 
Riyadh temporarily opened the land border for the haj last year, but not this time. A travel agency catering to migrant laborers in Doha said that had hit business.
""We sell haj journeys by bus with accommodation for around 12,000 riyals,"" its manager said. ""But as nobody can get visas and land borders are closed, it is zero bookings this year.""
The diplomatic crisis has defied mediation efforts by the United States, which has strong alliances with both sides and fears the split among its Sunni Muslim allies could benefit Shi'ite Iran.
Saudi Arabia and Iran are involved in proxy wars, including in Yemen and Syria, and tensions between the two have spilled over into the haj in the past.
In 2016, Iran boycotted the haj over security concerns after hundreds of people were killed in a crush there. Iranian pilgrims returned in 2017.

(Corrects month that boycott was imposed to June, not July.)

Iran’s Revolutionary Guards confirmed earlier this month it held war games in the Gulf, saying they were aimed at ""confronting possible threats"" by enemies.
The U.S. military’s Central Command confirmed it had seen increased Iranian naval activity, extending to the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic waterway for oil shipments the Revolutionary Guards have threatened to block.
Iran has been furious over U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of an international agreement on Iran's nuclear program and re-impose sanctions on Tehran.
Iranian Navy Commander Rear Admiral Hossein Khanzadi ""reiterated that coastal and sea testing of the short range defense Kamand system were concluded successfully, and said this system was mounted ... on a warship and will be mounted on a second ship soon,"" the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported,
The Kamand has been dubbed the ""Iranian Phalanx"" after an automated machinegun produced by U.S. firm Raytheon whose heavy bullets shred incoming missiles.

Unable to import many weapons because of international sanctions and arms embargoes, Iran has developed a large domestic weapons industry to achieve self-sufficiency in producing military equipment, and often reports on its development of arms which it says are comparable with advanced Western systems.

1097,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2018 03:51AM ET</span>",Former cricketer Imran Khan sworn-in as Pakistan's prime minister,"By Saad Sayeed
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Former cricket star Imran Khan was sworn in as prime minister of Pakistan on Saturday, taking on the challenge of forming a coalition to govern as a currency crisis looms over the turbulent, nuclear-armed South Asian country.
Khan, a firebrand nationalist, won a general election last month promising to fight corruption and drastically reduce poverty among Pakistan's 208 million mostly-Muslim people.
Wearing a traditional black sherwani coat, in the style of his hero and Pakistan founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Khan recited the oath of office and vowed to respect the constitution. 
""I will bear true faith and allegiance to Pakistan,"" Khan read from the oath, standing next to President Mamnoon Hussain.
Later, he was given a guard of honor on the lawns of the prime minister's house.
Military coup's have punctuated Pakistan's 71-year history, and Khan's election was only the second democratic transfer of power. If he completes his five-year term he will be the first Pakistani prime minister to do so.
His Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), or Justice Party, holds 151 of the 342 seats in the national assembly, where a vote was held on Friday to decide who would be asked to form a government.
Khan easily defeated rival Shehbaz Sharif from the outgoing Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party, garnering 176 votes to Sharif's 96 votes. 
Pakistan has been plagued by economic boom-and-bust cycles as well as by Islamist militant violence in more recent years.
And one of Khan's first calls as prime minister will be figuring out how to deal with a looming currency crisis that threatens to derail an economy growing at around six percent annually.
The new coalition government must urgently decide whether to ask the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a bailout, or seek support from China, the country Pakistan regards as its most reliable ally.
Relations with the United States are frayed, with U.S. officials fuming over Pakistan's alleged support Taliban fighters in Afghanistan. Islamabad denies aiding the insurgents.
The oath-taking was attended by scores of Pakistani celebrities, sportsmen, and politicians, as well as former Indian cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu, who serves as tourism minister for India's Punjab province. 
Khan has promised to create millions of jobs and build world-class hospitals and schools in a country where more than 40 percent of the population is illiterate.
After spending much of his political career on the fringes, the Oxford-educated former sportsman rose to power on a populist platform, and in recent years his anti-corruption message has increasingly resonated with Pakistanis, especially the young.

Khan's opponents say he owes his ascent to covert support from the country's powerful military, though both the army and Khan deny collusion.

It will be the Chinese leader's first visit to the North Korean capital since he took power in 2012, and 13 years after the last visit by a Chinese President, when Xi's predecessor Hu Jintao visited in 2005, the newspaper said on Saturday. 
The Straits Times did not say where it obtained the information and the Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
North Korea's celebrations are set to take place on Sept. 9 and the Straits Times said that Xi's visit could still be subject to last-minute changes. 
China is the reclusive country's most important trading partner and Kim has visited China three times so far this year during which he has held talks with Xi on improving cooperation between the two countries and economic reforms. 
The United States has stepped up sanctions on North Korea to pressure Pyongyang to give up its nuclear program. This week, the United States imposed sanctions on Chinese firms for exporting alcohol and cigarette products to North Korea in breach of those sanctions.

Pope Francis had voiced optimism in June that ties between the Vatican and China were improving, as the two sides were in advanced talks to settle one of the biggest obstacles to resuming diplomatic ties that were cut almost 70 years ago.
Catholics in China are split between those in ""underground"" communities that recognize the pope and those belonging to a state-controlled Catholic Patriotic Association where bishops are appointed by the government in collaboration with local Church communities.
While restoring diplomatic relations were not part of the ongoing talks, full relations would give the Church a legal framework to look after all of China's estimated 12 million Catholics and move on to focus on Catholic growth in a country where Protestant churches are already growing fast.
The Vatican currently maintains full diplomatic ties with Taiwan, not China, which views Taiwan as merely a wayward province.
Writing in the latest issue of the bi-monthly Communist Party theoretical journal Qiushi, or Seeking Truth, Wang Zuoan, director of the State Administration for Religious Affairs, said China had to remain in charge on religious matters.
""There is no affiliate relationship between our country's religions and foreign religions. Our country's religious groups and religious matters do not accept domination by foreign forces,"" Wang wrote, without making direct reference to any religion or the talks with the Vatican.
Religion in China has to follow the principle of ""Sinification"" under the guidance of the party, he added.
China's constitution proclaims freedom of belief, but in reality the officially atheist ruling Communist Party keeps a tight rein over all religious groups, an area of frequent concern for Western governments and rights groups.
Wang said that China guaranteed the rights of believers, and that it was wrong to believe religion could be left free of government supervision or that it should be forcefully curbed or even wiped out.
Still, religion should not be allowed to interfere in administrative, legal or education matters, he added.
""The separation of government and religion must be upheld,"" Wang wrote.

In a posting on its website, the State Administration for Market Regulation said that among officials dismissed were Ding Jianhua, who headed two departments at the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA). The same statement was posted on the CFDA's website.
Changsheng was accused in July of falsifying data for a rabies vaccine and manufacturing an ineffective vaccine for babies, sparking widespread public anger and multiple probes including police investigations.
The Changsheng case exposed that the CFDA officials ""did not provide sufficient supervision, strong enough oversight, nor were they strict enough in their inspections"", the posting said. 
While there were no known reports of people being harmed by the vaccines, regulators ordered Changsheng to halt their production and recall the rabies vaccine. Changsheng has apologized and said it is cooperating with investigations.
On Friday, Beijing said it had sacked a senior provincial official and was probing a former top drug regulator. Xinhua also reported that more than 40 government officials, including seven at the provincial level, have been held accountable for the scandal and some have been sacked.
In a separate Saturday report, Xinhua said the central province of Hubei has removed six government officials from their posts in relation to another inferior vaccines case involving Chinese company Wuhan Institute of Biological Products.
The company on Friday said on its website that it has dismissed its deputy general manager in charge of production and warned or fined eight other employees.

Marines found the lab after intelligence reports indicated that tons of drugs were being produced in the area of Alcoyonqui municipality, about 12 miles (19 km) outside the state capital of Culiacan, the ministry of the navy said in a statement.
In photos provided by the ministry, two marines in hazmat suits can be seen examining dozens of plastic containers in a mountain forest. 
The statement said the drugs were hidden underground in two areas along with barrels of the chemicals used to produce meth. The drugs were incinerated on site due to the difficult access to the remote location, the ministry said. 
Mexico is a major supplier of methamphetamine to the United States and it the top source of heroin, which is fueling a surge in opioid addiction. The country is also the principal highway for cocaine trafficked north.

Sinaloa is the seat of the powerful cartel formerly run by Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, who is facing trial in the United States later this year.

The assessment, at a time of heightened U.S.-China tensions over trade, was contained in an annual report that highlighted China's efforts to increase its global influence, with defense spending that the Pentagon estimated exceeded $190 billion in 2017.
China's Defence Ministry said in a statement late on Friday that the Pentagon report misrepresented China's strategic intentions and exaggerated the ""so-called China military threat.""
""China's military expresses resolute opposition to this and has lodged stern representations with the U.S. side,"" it said.
China is on the path of peaceful development and pursues a defensive national strategy, and has always been a contributor to world peace and protector of the global order, the ministry said.
""The Chinese military's strengthening of modernization is to protect the country's sovereignty, security and development interests, as well as global peace, stability and prosperity,"" it said.
""The Chinese military's reform, weapons development and defensive capabilities in the internet space are just and reasonable. The criticism in the U.S. report is pure guesswork.""
The Pentagon report said that while the People's Liberation Army had continued to extend operations, it was not clear what message Beijing was looking to send by carrying out bomber flights ""beyond a demonstration of improved capabilities.""
This year, China's air force landed bombers on islands and reefs in the South China Sea as part of a training exercise in the disputed region.
In January the Pentagon put countering Beijing, along with Russia, at the center of a new national defense strategy.
China's Defence Ministry said the ""peaceful construction work"" in the South China Sea was its right as a sovereign country, and it criticized the United States for its freedom of navigation operations there.
It said the report by the United States harms mutual trust between the two countries, the ministry said.
""We demand the U.S. side abandons Cold War thinking, objectively and rationally views China's defense and military construction, stops issuing the relevant reports, and takes actual steps to promote and protect the stable development of military-to-military relations,"" it said. 
While Washington and Beijing maintain a military-to-military relationship aimed at containing tensions, this has been tested in recent months, notably in May when the Pentagon withdrew an invitation to China to join a multinational naval exercise.

In June, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis became the first Pentagon chief to visit China since 2014.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The protection of Palestinian civilians could be improved by the deployment of U.N.-mandated armed forces or unarmed observers, a beefed-up U.N. civilian presence or expanded U.N. assistance, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres wrote in a report on Friday.
The United Nations General Assembly requested the report in a resolution adopted in June that condemned Israel for excessive force against Palestinian civilians and denounced the firing of rockets from Gaza into Israeli civilian areas, but did not mention Hamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza. 
The resolution asked for proposals to ensure ""the safety, protection and well-being of the Palestinian civilian population under Israeli occupation, including ... recommendations regarding an international protection mechanism.""
Guterres outlined four options, but he did not make a specific recommendation. He noted that all options would need the cooperation of both parties, a sustained cessation of hostilities and additional resources to ensure they were viable.
""The combination of prolonged military occupation, constant security threats, weak political institutions, and a deadlocked peace process provides for a protection challenge that is highly complex politically, legally and practically,"" he wrote.
Armed U.N. peacekeepers or armed forces from a group of like-minded states operating under a United Nations mandate could be deployed to offer physical protection, Guterres said. This option, however, would need a Security Council mandate and the United States, a close ally of Israel, would likely wield its veto.
A U.N. or non-U.N. civilian observer mission could be deployed ""with a specific mandate to report on protection and well-being issues and provide local mediation,"" Guterres said. This would also need a U.N.-mandate. 
A third option could be expanding current U.N. programs and development and humanitarian aid to address the needs of Palestinian civilians more effectively and strengthen Palestinian institutions, he wrote. 
The final option could be to send additional U.N. human rights, coordination and political officers to boost monitoring and reporting on the situation and increase the U.N.'s visibility, Guterres said. 
The General Assembly resolution requesting the report was adopted with 120 votes in favor, eight against and 45 abstentions. It was put forward in the General Assembly after the United States vetoed a similar resolution in the 15-member U.N. Security Council.
""The best way to ensure the safety and protection of the Palestinian civilian population is still the negotiation of a comprehensive, just and final settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict,"" Guterres said.

(Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday approved a plan to reunite hundreds more families who were separated by border officials after they entered the United States from Mexico.
The plan negotiated by the U.S. government and immigrant rights advocates marked the second stage of federal efforts to reunite 2,551 children ages 5 to 17 with their parents. 
These families had been separated under President Donald Trump's now-abandoned ""zero tolerance"" policy toward illegal immigrants.
As of Thursday, 541 of the children remained separated and under care of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, while another 24 under age 5 also remained in federal care. More than 2,000 children have already been reunited with their parents.
The plan sets out processes to locate parents outside the country, assess their fitness as parents, and determine their intentions for their children.
It also includes provisions negotiated this week, including that the government arrange travel for reunited children and not impair their right to seek future asylum.
""The joint proposed plan is approved wholeheartedly by the court,"" U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw said at a hearing in San Diego attended by U.S. Department of Justice and American Civil Liberties Union lawyers.
Trump abandoned the separation policy on June 20 after widespread criticism at home and internationally.
Sabraw said he would reserve judgment on a disputed issue of whether removed parents could be reunited with their children in the United States, instead of their original countries, including parents who may want asylum for their children.
Sabraw has been overseeing the reunification process since ordering on June 26 that families be reunited.
In a related case, Sabraw on Thursday put an indefinite freeze on deporting families who were separated at the border, including those who have been reunited.
Lawyers for the families had argued that some parents may have unknowingly waived their reunification rights, and that children have a right to their parents' help in seeking asylum.
Sabraw, who was appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush, on Friday acknowledged the challenges in efficiently bringing parents and children back together.

""This is an enormous undertaking involving a situation of the government's own making, but we will never be able to come up with a process that is perfect or restores all rights, as if this incident never happened,"" he said. ""All we can do is the best we can do under the present circumstances.""

Putin arrives in Germany after a stop at an Austrian vineyard to attend Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl's wedding to entrepreneur Wolfgang Meilinger.
Merkel warned on Friday against expecting too much from her discussions with Putin at the government's Meseberg palace, but said the two countries needed to remain in ""permanent dialogue"" on the long list of problems they face.
""It's a working meeting from which no specific results are expected,"" she told reporters. The two leaders last met in Sochi in May and struggled to overcome differences.
But both Juergen Hardt, foreign policy spokesman for Merkel's conservative bloc, and Achim Post, a senior member of the Social Democrats (SPD), junior partners in the coalition government, were more upbeat.
""We can be cautiously optimistic,"" Hardt told the Stuttgarter Zeitung and Stuttgarter Nachrichten newspapers in an interview published on Saturday. ""The Russian president has maneuvered himself into a dead end on Syria and eastern Ukraine, and needs international partners. For that he has to move.""

Post said in a statement that he expected both Merkel and Putin to look for pragmatic solutions based on common interests.
""In a world that is increasingly uncertain, we must speak particularly with difficult partners like Russia,"" he said.
Russia and the West remain at loggerheads over Moscow's annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine in 2014 and the ensuing conflict between Russian-backed separatists in the country's east and the Ukrainian army.
On Syria, Germany wants Putin to finalize a lasting ceasefire there in agreement with the United States. Merkel on Friday said a four-way meeting on Syria involving Germany, Russia, Turkey and France was possible.
Germany is also under strong pressure from the United States to halt work on the planned Nord Stream 2 pipeline that will carry gas from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea.
The United States says it will increase Germany's dependence on Russia for energy. Ukraine fears the pipeline will allow Russia to cut it off from the gas transit business. Germany's eastern European neighbors, nervous of Russian encroachment, have also raised concerns about the project.

Merkel and Putin will each make statements at 1600 GMT on Saturday before the start of the talks. They do not plan to take questions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States said on Friday it had secured $300 million from coalition partners to help stabilize parts of Syria retaken from Islamic State, after President Donald Trump demanded that allies help carry the costs of the war.
The State Department said it would redirect $230 million in frozen funding for Syria to other unspecified foreign policy priorities, while emphasizing that the move did not signal a retreat by Washington from the Syrian conflict.
Trump froze the $230 million in March, threatening to withdraw United States forces from Syria, subject to a review to reassess Washington's role in the brutal seven-year-old conflict. 
Whether or not the coalition money will convince him to stay is unclear.
The State Department named veteran U.S. diplomat and former ambassador to Iraq, Jim Jeffrey, as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's adviser for Syria, a role that will include overseeing the U.S. role in talks aimed at a political transition in Syria.
While Washington has long insisted that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad should go, the Trump administration appears to have accepted that Assad could remain until the end of his current seven-year presidential term in 2021.
Brett McGurk, the U.S. special envoy to the coalition fighting against Islamic State, will remain in his role as the U.S.-coalition prepares to clean up the last remaining militants in an area around the town of Hajin in eastern Syria.
""We still have not launched the final phase to defeat the physical Caliphate. That is actually being prepared now and will come at a time of our choosing, but it's coming,"" McGurk, the U.S. special presidential envoy overseeing the fight against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, told reporters.
The U.S. believes that Islamic State has lost about 98 percent of the territory it held in Iraq and Syria 
NO RECONSTRUCTION WITHOUT TALKS
Acting U.S. Assistant Secretary David Satterfield said the United States and other countries would not contribute to Syria's full reconstruction until there was a ""credible and irreversible"" political process underway to end the conflict.
""There is not going to be by international agreement reconstruction assistance to Syria unless the U.N. ... validates that a credible and irreversible political process is underway,"" Satterfield told a conference call.
Both the Russian and Syrian governments want international funding to rebuild Syria, he said.
Russia joined the war on Assad's behalf in 2015, turning the momentum in his favor. Assad also enjoys robust support from Iran and Lebanon’s Hezbollah. 
McGurk said Saudi Arabia had contributed $100 million and United Arab Emirates had pledged $50 million in donations to stabilizing programs. Australia, Denmark, European Union, Taiwan, Kuwait, Germany and France also participated, he said.
""We are remaining in Syria. The focus is on the enduring fight against ISIS,"" said McGurk.
In its early stages, the war shattered Syria into a patchwork of areas held by different forces. The fighting has killed hundreds of thousands of people and forced more than half the pre-war population from their homes.

A report by the U.N.'s Arab countries agency ESCWA has cited experts as saying the volume of destruction of Syria’s physical capital and its sectoral distribution exceeded $388 billion.

The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the 2015 deal in which Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear work in return for the lifting of most Western sanctions, is in line with the international community's ""common interest"", the Chinese diplomat said in a phone conversation with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, according to Xinhua.
""We have openly indicated that we oppose the wrong practices of unilateral sanctions and 'long-arm jurisdiction' in international relations,"" Wang Yi was quoted as saying. 
Beijing has cultivated close commercial links with Tehran, especially in the energy sector.
China's ties with Tehran are open, transparent and lawful, its foreign ministry said earlier in August, after U.S. President Donald Trump said companies doing business with Iran would be barred from the United States.

Earlier this year, Trump took the call to pull the United States out of the JCPOA, ignoring pleas from the other world powers that had co-sponsored the deal, including Washington's main European allies, Britain, France and Germany, as well as Russia and China.

This week, Venezuela asked Peru to find two of its citizens in connection with what Caracas has called an assassination attempt against Maduro. It also asked Peru to find six military officials considered fugitives in Venezuela.
""With respect to the first two, no migratory entry or exit from our country has been registered,"" Migrations Superintendent Eduardo Sevilla told a news conference. Peru will check if the military officials have entered Peru and proceed in accordance with ""the laws in place,"" Sevilla added, without offering specifics.
Maduro's government has accused opposition politicians and activists abroad of scheming to assassinate him with drones that were laden with explosives during a military parade earlier this month.
Fourteen people have been arrested. Maduro's critics say he is using the incident to stifle dissent and cement his power in the oil-rich nation.
Peru has been a leading critic of Maduro's government in recent years. It was unclear if Peru would detain and turn over any Venezuelan citizens at Maduro's request.
Nearly 400,000 Venezuelans are now in Peru, the majority of whom have entered the Andean nation of some 32 million people in recent months, according to official statistics.
Venezuelans have been fleeing their country because of a deep economic crisis that has been marked by shortages of food, medicine and other essentials.
But Peru will start requiring passports from Venezuelan migrants starting Aug. 25, a week after neighboring Ecuador implements the same requirement, Interior Minister Mauro Medina said at Friday's news conference.
Peru and Ecuador have allowed Venezuelans, as well as citizens of some other countries in the region, to enter their borders using national ID cards. The policy had given desperate Venezuelans an easier route out of their crisis-stricken homeland, where it can be difficult to obtain passports amid chronic shortages.
Medina said the change in policy aims to beef up security following a spate of crimes spotlighted in local media involving Venezuelans, some of whom had fake national ID cards.
""There's no hostile or discriminatory attitude here,"" Medina said. ""What we want is to clearly identify every citizen that comes to our country.""
About 20 percent of Venezuelans now enter Peru without passports, according to the Interior Ministry.
It was unclear if Venezuelans seeking refugee status in Peru would have to present passports to enter the country.

1110,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>","In northeast Nigerian camp, one in 200 young children 'died over two weeks'","By Paul Carsten
ABUJA (Reuters) - More than one of every 200 children aged under five at a camp in northeast Nigeria died in just two weeks in early August, according to Reuters calculations based on data from aid agency Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF) on Friday.
The northeast has been embroiled for almost a decade in a war with Islamist insurgents Boko Haram and, more recently, Islamic State in West Africa (ISWA). 
Under a government program, hundreds of thousands of people living in the region are being moved for safety to fortified garrison towns, ringed by farms, recaptured from the militants.
In a camp in one of those towns - Bama - MSF teams found that 33 out of an estimated 6,000 children under five died in the two weeks from 2 Aug., the agency said.
""A lot of children are already in a critical state upon arrival, and poor assistance and access to healthcare further deteriorates their condition,"" said Katja Lorenz, MSF's representative in Abuja, in the statement.
Despite the presence of government and international aid agencies, ""the health and nutrition situation has been allowed to deteriorate up to the current crisis point,"" she said. 
Inhabitants of the camp include more than 10,000 people who had come in from the bush since April, many because of military activity. They had pushed the camp beyond capacity by late July, MSF said.
Bama and other similar towns also frequently come under attack.
A spokesman for Nigeria's National Emergency Management Agency, responsible for government aid in the northeast, declined to provide immediate comment. 
The government has since late 2015 been declaring the defeat of Boko Haram but last month, following a succession of military defeats, the army appointed its fourth commander in little over a year to tackle the insurgency.
At least 100 troops were killed in an ISWA attack last month on a base in Jilli in northeastern Yobe state, said three people familiar with the matter. Two of them said some of the soldiers had been buried in mass graves. 
A Nigerian military spokesman neither confirmed nor denied the death toll.

1111,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 03:57PM ET</span>",Brazil's Lula should have political rights: U.N. Human Rights Committee,"By Brad Brooks
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The United Nations Human Rights Committee, a panel of independent experts, on Friday said it had requested that the Brazilian government allow imprisoned former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to exercise his political rights as a presidential candidate.
Lula is the candidate for his Workers Party (PT) and leads presidential polls ahead of the October ballot, but is widely expected to be banned from running by an electoral court. He was jailed in April on a corruption conviction.
The U.N. Committee, which oversees countries' compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, said in an emailed statement that it asked Brazil's government ""not to prevent him from standing for election in the 2018 presidential elections, until his appeals before the courts have been completed in fair judicial proceedings.""
The statement added the Brazilian government should ensure ""that Lula can enjoy and exercise his political rights while in prison, as candidate in the 2018 presidential elections.""
""This includes having appropriate access to the media and members of his political party,"" the committee said.
Brazil's U.N. delegation in Geneva said in a written statement that the committee's conclusions were not legally binding, but that the recommendations on Lula would be passed on to the country's judiciary.
Under Brazilian law, Lula is allowed free access to his lawyers, which include some top PT figures, as well as weekly family visits. He is allowed to communicate in writing, but federal prosecutors say he is barred from making video or audio recordings. 
Lula's legal team said in a written statement that they interpret the committee's decision as meaning that ""no Brazilian government entity can present any obstacles to former president Lula's ability to run in the 2018 presidential elections, until his appeals are exhausted in a fair trial.""
Ahead of the Oct. 7 vote, Brazil's top electoral court is expected to declare Lula ineligible in the coming weeks under a ""Clean Slate"" law that bans politicians from seeking public office if they have been convicted of a crime and it has been upheld on appeal, as is the case with Lula.

Lula has said his conviction was the result of political persecution and that it is part of a right-wing conspiracy to keep him from regaining the presidency.

GAZA (Reuters) - Israeli troops killed two Palestinians and wounded scores of others taking part in weekly Gaza border protests on Friday, medics said, as Egyptian mediators tried to clinch a truce deal that would calm the impoverished enclave.
In Jerusalem's Old City, another area that Palestinians want for a future state, Israeli police said they shot dead an Arab who attacked them with a knife after leaving a mosque complex. 
After a more than four-month surge in confrontations over the Gaza Strip border, Israel this week eased its clampdown on the enclave's commercial traffic and fishing. Cairo said it was finalizing details of a longer-term accommodation between Israel and the dominant Palestinian Islamist group Hamas.
Some 20,000 people participated in Friday's protests, which took place a few hundred meters from the fence, though dozens came closer, with some rolling burning tires, witnesses said. 
Medics said Israeli gunfire killed two men and wounded at least 270 other Palestinians, 50 of them with live bullets.
An Israeli army spokeswoman said troops had responded with ""riot-dispersal means"" to prevent breaches of the border. 
Friday's deaths brought to 170 the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces since the weekly protests began on March 30. The campaign is pressing for rights to land that Palestinians lost to Israel in the 1948 war of its foundation, and for an end to the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza.
Anger in Gaza has also been stoked by funding cuts by the Western-backed administration of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, which dominates the West Bank and is the rival of Hamas, which runs Gaza. Their efforts at agreeing on a power-sharing unity deal with Egyptian mediation have not borne fruit.
Cairo had no immediate comment on Friday's incidents.
Hamas official Izzat Reshiq said the group, and other Palestinian factions, concluded a round of talks with Egyptian security officials over a possible truce with Israel and that further talks were scheduled for later this month.
""Efforts will resume after the holiday of Eid Al-Adha,"" Reshiq said on Twitter, referring to a Muslim festival that begins on Aug. 21 and ends on Aug. 24. 
Israel sees the Gaza protests as a bid by Hamas, against which it has fought three wars in the last decade, to use civilians as cover for cross-border attacks. Hamas denies this. 
Separately, Israeli police said they were attacked on Friday by a knife-wielding man after he emerged from a complex housing Al Aqsa mosque, Islam's third-holiest shrine, in East Jerusalem.
The man was shot dead, police said, describing him as a resident of an Israeli Arab town where pro-Palestinian sympathies are strong. CCTV video from the scene showed a man lunging at a police trooper with a knife, but not what followed.
Palestinians said that, after the incident, Israeli authorities barred Muslim worshippers from Al Aqsa mosque.

""This is a grave escalation that may lead to unpredictable consequences,"" Abbas said in a statement carried by the official Palestinian news agency Wafa.

1113,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 03:32PM ET</span>",U.S. imposes sanctions on Myanmar military over Rohingya crackdown,"By Matt Spetalnick and David Brunnstrom
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Friday imposed sanctions on four Myanmar military and police commanders and two army units, accusing them of ""ethnic cleansing"" against Rohingya Muslims and widespread human rights abuses across the Southeast Asian nation.
The sanctions by the Treasury Department marked the toughest U.S. action so far in response to Myanmar's crackdown on the Rohingya minority, which started last year and has driven more than 700,000 people into neighboring Bangladesh and left thousands of dead behind.
But the Trump administration did not target the highest levels of Myanmar's military and also stopped short of calling the anti-Rohingya campaign crimes against humanity or genocide, which has been the subject of debate within the U.S. government.
The measures were announced as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to U.S. officials, prepares to issue the findings of an intensive U.S. investigation of alleged atrocities by Myanmar authorities against the Rohingya in Rakhine state. 
The release of the report, compiled from interviews at refugee camps in Bangladesh, is expected to be around the August 25 one-year anniversary of the bloody crackdown.
“Burmese security forces have engaged in violent campaigns against ethnic minority communities across Burma, including ethnic cleansing, massacres, sexual assault, extrajudicial killings, and other serious human rights abuses,"" said Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Sigal Mandelker, using an alternative name for Myanmar. 
""Treasury is sanctioning units and leaders overseeing this horrific behavior as part of a broader U.S. government strategy to hold accountable those responsible for such wide-scale human suffering,” Mandelker said.
The sanctions were imposed on military commanders Aung Kyaw Zaw, Khin Maung Soe and Khin Hlaing and border police commander Thura San Lwin, in addition to the 33rd and 99th Light Infantry Divisions. The measures call for freezes of any U.S. assets the individuals hold, a prohibition on Americans doing business with them as well as bans on travel to the United States.
A Reuters special report in June gave a comprehensive account of the roles played by the two infantry divisions in the offensive against the Rohingya.
The military in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, also known as Burma, has denied accusations of ethnic cleansing and says its actions were part of a fight against terrorism.
Myanmar's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""LONG OVERDUE STEP""
Critics have accused President Donald Trump of being slow in his response to the Rohingya crisis. Human rights groups noted that while Friday's sanctions list included generals, Myanmar's powerful army chief, Min Aung Hlaing, was spared.
Rich Weir, Myanmar researcher at Human Rights Watch, called the sanctions ""an important but long overdue step.""
""The avoidance of the top military leaders is striking,"" he added. ""The likelihood that they did not know what was happening is close to infinitesimal.""
In the Treasury statement, Mandelker said: ""The U.S. government is committed to ensuring that Burmese military units and leaders reckon with and put a stop to these brutal acts.""
In November, following the lead of the United Nations and the European Union, then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson declared that the Rohingya crisis constituted ""ethnic cleansing,"" a designation that increased pressure on its civilian leader, Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.
Pompeo has yet to decide whether, once he releases the State Department's Rohingya atrocities report, to ratchet up characterization of the violence as crimes against humanity or genocide or to avoid any such label, the officials told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Such terms could commit the United States to stronger punitive measures or help set the stage for charges at the International Criminal Court in the Hague. Some within the administration worry that this could complicate Suu Kyi's relationship with the powerful military and push Myanmar closer to China, Washington's regional rival.
Until Friday's announcement, the United States had only sanctioned a single Myanmar commander and had scaled back already-limited bilateral military ties.
On Friday, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington state, called on social media companies to better protect vulnerable communities by regulating hate speech on their platforms, citing a Reuters report that found more than 1,000 examples of content published on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that attacked the Rohingya and other Muslims in Myanmar. ( https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/myanmar-facebook-hate )
""Facebook and other technology companies must find the means to address these problems head on and invest in solutions,"" said Cantwell in a statement. 
Two Reuters reporters, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, are on trial in Myanmar on charges of violating a state secrets law after being arrested in December while reporting on the massacre of 10 Rohingya men. Both have pleaded not guilty and have told the court how they were ""trapped"" by police officials who planted documents on them.

This month Pompeo called for the immediate release of the two reporters.

1114,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 03:28PM ET</span>",Italy acts to revoke motorway concession after bridge collapse,"By Ilaria Polleschi
GENOA (Reuters) - Italy's government on Friday launched a formal procedure aimed at revoking concessions held by Autostrade per l'Italia to operate toll highways after a bridge it managed collapsed this week, killing at least 38 people.
Some members of the governing coalition had earlier hinted that less drastic steps, such as a fine, may be considered, but the leaders of both ruling parties vowed a hard line and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte later said he had put words into action.
""Today the government...has formally sent to Autostrade per l'Italia the letter of complaint which launches the process for revoking the concession,"" Conte said in a statement.
The statement said the disaster was the fault of the company which ""had the obligation to look after the ordinary and extraordinary maintenance of the motorway"". It added that Autostrade now had 15 days to present its counter-arguments. 
Matteo Salvini, deputy prime minister and head of the right-wing League party that governs with the 5-Star Movement, said the procedure for revoking the license would take ""weeks or months"".
Some sector experts estimate that if it revokes the concession the government will have to pay Autostrade up to 20 billion euros ($22.85 billion) in compensation for investments the firm has made, though the government denies this.
Shares in  Atlantia  (MI:ATL), parent company of Autostrade, plunged more than 30 percent after the bridge collapse in Genoa on Tuesday, but recovered somewhat on Friday, closing up 5.7 percent.
Atlantia is controlled by the holding company for the Benetton family, famous for its clothing empire.
Conte said that from now on the government would compel holders of concessions in all Italy's creaking infrastructures to invest more of their profits in maintenance and safety.
""This disaster obliges us to take new initiatives which are far more rigorous than those contemplated by previous administrations,"" he said.
A Genoa court will try to establish the exact cause of the bridge failure, but experts said problems with the concrete-encased cable stays were a possible culprit.
An engineering study commissioned by Autostrade last year warned about the condition of the stays, said Carmelo Gentile, a professor from Milan's Polytechnic university who was on the team that carried it out.
Antonio Brencich, an engineering professor at Genoa University, said the bridge had been shown to be defective just two decades after it was opened in 1967. On Friday, he said the failure of a cable stay could have been behind the collapse. 
""The rupture of a cable stay is a serious working hypothesis,"" Brencich said. ""There are witnesses and videos that point in that direction.""
Atlantia did not respond to a written request for comment and attempts to phone a company official were not successful.
Autostrade has said it monitored the bridge on a quarterly basis, as required by law, and carried out additional checks by hiring external experts. It had no immediate comment on Friday's reports about problems with the stays.
STATE FUNERAL
As politicians responded to public outrage over the tragedy, rescue workers used jackhammers and cranes to lift giant slabs of concrete from the riverbed beneath the fallen span, hoping to find survivors buried in the rubble.
More than 300 firefighters have been working non-stop since Tuesday, though experts say chances of finding survivors are now slim. The civil protection agency said on Friday that five people feared to be near the site of the disaster were still unaccounted for. 
Vehicles on the highway that links Genoa to the French border west of the Mediterranean port city plummeted 50 meters (165 feet) when a 200-metre (660-foot) stretch of the viaduct collapsed. 
Firefighters, who are using sniffer dogs as well as heavy machinery, have not yet reached all the cars.
""We are trying to find points where we can penetrate these incredibly heavy slabs. Then the earthmoving equipment moves in to create a passageway where the dogs can enter,"" firefighter Stefano Zanut said at the scene. 
Rescuers are hoping the large chunks of debris may have created a ""triangle of survival"" when they fell, where someone could still be alive, he said.
A state funeral for many of the victims will be held on Saturday at Genoa's convention center, led by the city's archbishop, Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco, and attended by President Sergio Mattarella and Conte.
Twelve coffins have already been placed in a large hall, and family members visited them on Friday, sometimes kissing the caskets. One white coffin held the body of seven-year-old Samuele Robbiano, who died alongside his parents. 
""It is something that has touched everyone because we all used the bridge and it could have happened to anyone,"" Bishop Nicolo Anselmi said after blessing the coffins. 
Some families plan to boycott the event and hold their own private services, as a sign of protest against what they say was negligence that caused the bridge to collapse.

The funeral of four young men who were en route to a holiday together in France and Spain when the disaster struck was being held in Torre del Greco, near Naples, on Friday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday he had canceled a planned military parade for November due to high costs and would instead visit Paris to commemorate the end of World War I, a day after the Pentagon postponed the event to at least next year. 
Trump had requested a parade to honor U.S. military veterans and commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of the first world war, after marveling at the Bastille Day military parade he attended in Paris last year.
But, on Thursday, a U.S. official said the cost of such an event could top $90 million, nearly three times as much as the White House had earlier estimated. The Defense Department ultimately postponed the event, originally planned for Nov. 10 in Washington.
Trump, in a pair of tweets, said he would instead celebrate the occasion in Paris on Nov. 11, the U.S Veterans Day holiday. 
He also said he would attend a parade at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, but gave no date. A spokeswoman at the base was not able to immediately provide the date for the event.
Critics had blasted the planned Washington parade, questioning the lofty cost and the need for it as the Pentagon has sought to stabilize an over-stretched military.
But in Trump's tweets, the Republican president blamed local Washington officials for seeking a ""windfall,"" and suggested they were inflating the parade's costs.
Washington, D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, hit back at Trump, saying in a Twitter post that she was ""the local politician who finally got thru to the reality star in the White House with the realities ($21.6M) of parades/events/demonstrations in Trump America (sad).""
""A great celebratory parade costs money, Mr Trump, and it's YOUR Pentagon that's suggesting more than $90 million. Don't blame others,"" Washington, D.C. Council chairman Phil Mendelson, another Democrat, also tweeted.
Republican lawmaker Scott Taylor backed the decision to cancel the parade, saying he did not think it was appropriate to hold such an event while U.S. troops were still fighting in wars overseas.
""I don't agree that it's a good idea. We're still at war right now ... We're still out there, our people are still out there around the world right now, in harm's way,"" Taylor said in an interview with CNN.
Military parades in the United States are rare and historically have been used to mark the end of a military conflict. In 1991, tanks and thousands of troops paraded through Washington to celebrate the end of the Gulf War.

The Elysee Palace, the official residence of French President Emmanuel Macron, had no immediate comment on Trump's planned visit.

Last week Germany and Spain sealed a similar deal on returning migrants. Both deals come after a dispute between Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and their Bavarian allies over returning migrants that nearly split them and brought down the government.
""The signature of an administrative agreement with Greece is a further step on the way to more orderly conditions in European migration policy,"" German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said in a statement.
Ministry spokeswoman Eleonore Petermann told a news conference the Greek agreement, like the one with Spain, would allow Germany to send migrants entering via Germany's border with Austria to Greece within 48 hours.
In exchange, Germany agreed to deal with a backlog of family reunification applications by the end of 2018, and to reconsider disputed cases, the ministry said.
Petermann said Germany was also in ""very advanced"" negotiations on a similar deal with the Italian government and she expected a deal to be struck. Last Friday Petermann said both Italy and Greece had made counterdemands.
The deals are not likely to affect many refugees. Figures from the Interior Ministry last week showed that since mid-June around 150 people who had already applied for asylum in another EU country had been detected entering Germany from Austria.
More than 1.6 million migrants have arrived in Germany since mid-2014, provoking tensions and propelling the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) into the national parliament. 
Merkel has repeatedly defended her 2015 decision to admit hundreds of thousands of migrants as a humanitarian necessity, but has since vowed to prevent a re-run of such a migrant influx.

Speaking about the deal with Greece, she told a news conference: ""It's good that we've got a result.""

Cisse lost in a landslide to incumbent President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, picking up just 33 percent of the vote in an election in which only 34 percent of a politics-weary electorate voted. 
Although largely peaceful, the election was tainted by militant violence especially in the center and north, where hundreds of polling stations remained closed, and by allegations from Cisse that Keita's camp had stuffed ballots and toyed with the electoral roll to win votes. 
Cisse says that without any fraudulent votes he would have won 51 percent of the vote. 
""We have already filed constitutional court appeals,"" Cisse told a small crowd of cheering supporters in the capital Bamako. ""We are within the deadline and we have until midnight to make further changes."" 
The European Union observer mission and other local and international monitors have said that although there were irregularities and disruptions, they saw no evidence of fraud.

KOCHI/BENGALURU, India (Reuters) - The worst floods in a century in the Indian state of Kerala have killed 164 people and forced more than 200,000 into relief camps, officials said on Friday, with the toll expected to rise as heavy rain pushes water levels higher still.
As the southwestern coastal state's chief minister sought military reinforcements to boost rescue efforts, a disaster management official said that, since the monsoon season started about three months ago, more than 320 people had died due to flooding and landslides.
As the waters have risen, many people have found it increasingly hard to access food and other basic amenities, or to reach safety.
""In some areas, airlifting is the only option... thousands are still marooned,"" Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said.
Vijayan said he was hoping the military could step up its support for rescuers already using dozens of helicopters and hundreds of boats.
""I spoke to the defense minister this morning and asked for more helicopters,"" he told a news conference in the state capital, Thiruvananthapuram, adding that he planned to send 11 more helicopters to the worst-hit areas.
During the current monsoon, Kerala has been hit with over a third more rain than average, according to India's weather office. Vijayan said the floods were the worst in a century.
In the latest bout that began nine days ago, 164 people have died and some 223,000 moved into more than 1,500 relief camps, Vijayan said.
Further heavy rainfall has been forecast for most parts of the state on Saturday, and authorities said they planned to implement controlled releases of water from dams to manage flows and minimize damage.
Rains are expected to subside to ""light to moderate"" levels on Sunday, India's weather office said.

STRANDED AND DESPERATE
A Reuters witness in a relief helicopter in Chengannur, a town in southern Kerala, saw people stranded on roof tops and waving desperately for help.
""The town looked like an island dotted with houses and cars submerged in muddy flood waters and downed coconut trees,"" he said.
Two circling navy helicopters dropped food and water in metal baskets and airlifted out at least four people, including a three-year-old child.
Anil Vasudevan, the head of the Kerala health disaster response wing, said his department had geared up to meet victims' needs.
""We've deployed adequate doctors and staff and provided all essential medicines in the relief camps,"" he said.
His teams were also making arrangements to minimize the risk of people contracting water-borne diseases once they return home after the floodwaters subside.
The rains have also disrupted transport networks in Kerala, a major destination for domestic and foreign tourists. 
The flooded airport in the main commercial city Kochi has suspended operations until Aug. 26, and rail and road traffic has been interrupted in many places.
""Water levels continue to overflow on tracks and surpassing the danger level of bridges at different places,"" Southern Railway said in a statement, adding it had canceled more than a dozen trains.
Some crops have also been inundated. The state is a major producer of rubber, tea, coffee and spices such as black pepper and cardamom. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Twitter he would travel to Kerala ""to take stock of the unfortunate situation"".

A specialist organized crime unit arrested one, 29-year-old Chilean man in the northern city of  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO) overnight after using cellphone triangulation to locate him, police said. 
The man was arrested early Friday morning at his home, and his cellphone and other items were seized as evidence, Santiago's police chief, Jose Rivera Aedo, told a news conference. 
The man, who has not been named, was due to appear before a court in Santiago on Friday afternoon on charges of making threats of explosives contrary to national security legislation. 
A second, 33-year-old man, also Chilean and identified as Boris Chacon Flores, was detained at Santiago airport on Thursday afternoon after allegedly ""joking"" about a bomb in his bag to a friend as he went through security, a spokeswoman for the Santiago West prosecutor said. The man appeared in court on one charge of making a false bomb threat. 
There was no apparent link between the two arrested men, the spokeswoman, María Angelica Venegas, said in an interview. Police chief Rivera declined to say whether authorities were looking for more suspects. 
Hundreds of passengers and their luggage were grounded at airports around the region after threats were made toward planes operated by LATAM airlines, a major regional carrier, and Sky, a low-cost Chilean airline.

Chilean President Sebastian Pinera wrote on Twitter that his government would push for punitive charges against the suspect who allegedly made the calls ""to make an example of him.""

1120,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>","Higher living costs, fees force many Egyptians to drop haj plans","By Ali Abdelaty
CAIRO (Reuters) - Mahmoud Aouni has always wanted to make the haj pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia, an important religious duty for all Muslims, but says he might never be able to do so now because of Egypt's economic woes.
""They say charity begins at home. In the current economic climate, that's where it stays,"" said Aouni, a 47-year-old youth ministry worker who like many Egyptians has been forced to put off his plans indefinitely by the rising cost of living.
All Muslims are expected to join the annual haj at least once in a lifetime, provided they are physically and financially able. But many Egyptians have been badly hit by soaring prices, especially of fuel and electricity, as the government slashes state subsidies under IMF-backed economic reforms.
Even wealthier pilgrims are now finding the journey more difficult after Saudi Arabia and Egypt both imposed additional fees for Muslims repeating the lesser pilgrimage to Mecca, known as the 'umrah', within three years.
Unlike the last two years, when all those who signed up for the haj made the journey to Mecca, state news agency MENA quoted Parliamentary Affairs Minister Omar Marwan as saying only 64,000 of Egypt's 80,000 haj quota would now make the pilgrimage - a drop of 20 percent. Last year 80,000 Egyptians went on the haj.
Officials at Cairo airport said several flights to Saudi Arabia's Jeddah airport ahead of the pilgrimage, which starts next week, culminating in the Eid al-Adha feast, had been canceled.
COSTLY
""No one can fork out enough for religious obligations. How can I undertake the haj when I can barely afford to run a household?"" Aouni said.
""Before 2010, five or six of my neighbors would go each year. Now, it's one person from the neighborhood every three or four years.""
Ahmed Ibrahim, a tourism ministry official who works on its haj committee, said the number of Egyptians performing the umrah, which can be done at any time of the year, had dropped by almost 50 percent in 2018 from last year.
""It's because of the economic situation and the umrah fees. Egypt and Saudi's decision to make people who want to do it more than once pay more has meant many people simply aren't going back again,"" he said.
Saudi Arabia set a 2,000 riyal ($533) fee for Muslims performing the umrah journey for a second time within three years. This year Egypt also raised its own fee for citizens planning to make a second umrah pilgrimage.
Pilgrimage costs have doubled to 60,000 Egyptian pounds ($3,361) for people traveling on economy packages by land, while luxury packages - which include flights, upmarket accommodation and other services - have increased to 152,000 Egyptian pounds from 100,000 last year, haj companies say.
Hamada Radi a 55-year-old civil servant, said the total pilgrimage can end up costing as much as 120,000 Egyptian pounds (around $6,700).

""Plane ticket prices have gone up, and the haj fees here and in Saudi also, so it is those with money who get to go,"" he said. ""But it is in my plans. God willing, I will do the haj when I can get things together.""

1121,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 01:00PM ET</span>",Top Pennsylvania Catholic leader vows to ensure abuses 'never recur',"(Reuters) - Pennsylvania's top Roman Catholic official on Friday vowed to ensure the widespread sexual abuse by hundreds of priests and cover-up revealed in this week's bombshell grand jury report would never happen again.
In the most wide-ranging U.S. investigation into sexual abuse by priests since the scandal burst into the public eye in Boston in 2002, a two-year Pennsylvania investigation found evidence that at least 1,000 people, mostly children, had been sexually abused by some 300 clergymen during the past 70 years. The report said the numbers of actual victims and abusers could be much higher.
""The substance of the report is brutally graphic and profoundly disturbing as a chronicle of evil inflicted on hundreds of innocents,"" Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput said in a weekly letter to Catholics. ""The only acceptable responses are grief and support for the victims and comprehensive efforts to ensure that such things never recur.""
Chaput's archdiocese was not covered by the Tuesday report, although a 2005 grand jury report found evidence that hundreds of children had been sexually abused by at least 63 priests in the district.
Reuters this week contacted the attorneys general of the 49 other U.S. states to see if they were considering similar actions. Only two, in New York and New Mexico, said they had taken some initial steps toward doing so.
Most declined to confirm or deny any investigations, said their state laws limited their ability to take on wide-ranging criminal investigations or did not respond to requests for comment.
The Vatican broke its silence on the report late Thursday, when spokesman Greg Burke called the abuses revealed in the graphic report ""criminal and morally reprehensible.""
The nearly 900-page report describes in graphic detail decades of sexual assaults, grooming of minors to make them more vulnerable and other abuses by priests and other clergy.
Over the years the sexual abuse scandal has taken a heavy toll on the U.S. Catholic Church, driving down attendance and donations and leading to the closure of parishes as the Church paid out hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements. Victims have struggled with long-term mental health issues, substance abuse and in some cases have committed suicide, according to victim advocacy groups.

Similar reports have emerged in Europe, Australia and Chile, prompting lawsuits and investigations, undercutting the moral authority of the leadership of the Catholic Church, which has some 1.2 billion members around the world.

1122,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 12:52PM ET</span>",U.S. attorney general issues order to speed up immigrant deportations,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Thursday sought to speed up the deportation of illegal immigrants, telling immigration judges they should only postpone cases in removal proceedings ""for good cause shown.""
Sessions, in an interim order that was criticized by some lawyers, said the ""good-cause"" standard ""limits the discretion of immigration judges and prohibits them from granting continuances for any reason or no reason at all.""
Unlike the federal judiciary system, U.S. immigration courts fall under the Department of Justice and the attorney general can intervene. Sessions, a Republican former U.S. Senator appointed by President Donald Trump, has been unusually active in this practice compared to his predecessors.
Sessions has led efforts by the Trump administration to crack down on illegal immigration, including a ""zero tolerance"" policy that separated immigrant parents from their children while they were in U.S. detention. Trump abandoned the separation policy in June under political pressure.
Critical in showing ""good cause"" is whether a person is likely to succeed in efforts to remain in the United States, either by appealing for asylum or receiving some form of visa or work permit, Sessions said on Thursday.
Stephen Kang, an attorney with the ACLU immigrants rights project, described Sessions' order as ""troubling"" and one of a series that ""has moved in the direction of restricting due process rights for individuals who are in removal proceedings.""
Kang said Sessions seemed to portray immigrants seeking more time to prepare their cases as trying to ""game the system and avoid deportation.""
Kang said removal proceedings were complex and people needed time ""both to get lawyers to ensure that their due process rights are protected and time just to make sure their cases get a fair hearing.""
The Justice Department has been struggling to reduce a backlog of deportation cases. An analysis by the Government Accountability Office last year found the number of cases that drag on from one year to the next more than doubled between 2006 and 2015, mainly because fewer cases are completed per year.
Department spokesman Devin O'Malley said more immigration judges had been hired, but ""unnecessary and improper continuances ... continue to plague the immigration court system and contribute to the backlog.""
Sessions said on Thursday that the ""use of continuances as a dilatory tactic is particularly pernicious in the immigration context"" because people in the country illegally who want to remain have an incentive to delay their deportation as long as possible.

Granting continuances solely for good cause would be an ""important check on immigration judges' authority"" and demonstrate public interest in ""expeditious enforcement of the immigration laws,"" Sessions said.

1123,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>",Federal probe targets Ohio State over sex abuse allegations,"By Bernie Woodall
(Reuters) - Federal authorities have opened a civil rights investigation into how Ohio State University officials responded to allegations of sexual abuse by a now-deceased doctor who worked for its athletic department, the school said.
The investigation by the U.S. Department of Education will focus on what school officials knew about alleged crimes by the late Dr. Richard Strauss, OSU said on Thursday in a statement.
Last month, the university said that more than 100 former students have told investigators they were victims of Strauss, who killed himself in 2005. 
He had retired in 1998 after working as a university staff physician during the 1970s, '80 and '90s for several varsity sports, the school's medical center and student health clinic. The abuse allegedly occurred from 1979 to 1997, according to claims from athletes in 14 varsity sports and former patients of the student clinic, OSU has said. 
The scandal has had implications for an Ohio congressman, U.S. Representative Jim Jordan, who was an assistant wrestling coach at OSU at the same time Strauss was there. Jordan has been accused by several former student wrestlers of being told about sexual abuse by the doctor but failing to intervene to stop it. 
The Republican, considered by some to be a possible contender to succeed the retiring House Speaker Paul Ryan, has denied knowing anything about abuse allegations at the time.
The OSU said in its statement that federal investigators will examine whether the university is responding ""promptly and equitably"" to complaints and reports by former students, including allegations that employees knew or should have known about sexual misconduct but allowed the abuse to continue.
""We responded promptly and appropriately to the allegations received in April about Dr. Strauss,"" Gates Garrity-Rokous, vice president and chief compliance officer at OSU, said in the statement https://news.osu.edu/ohio-state-shares-updates-related-to-dr-richard-strauss. ""We are confident in the independence and thoroughness of the investigation we launched then as well as our ongoing commitment to transparency.""
Similar sex scandals in recent years have embroiled top officials at several major U.S. institutions of higher education, including Penn State University, Michigan State University and the University of Southern California.

A U.S. State Department statement on the sentencing of Le Dinh Luong after a one-day trial on Thursday called on Vietnam to release all prisoners of conscience immediately.
Luong, 53, was arrested last year after encouraging people to boycott a National Assembly election, writing Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) posts that expressed views against the ruling Communist Party and state, and inciting protests against a Taiwanese steel firm. He was charged with attempting to overthrow the state.
""The trend of increased arrests and harsh sentences for peaceful activists in Vietnam is troubling,"" the State Department said.
""The United States calls on Vietnam to release all prisoners of conscience immediately and to allow all individuals in Vietnam to express their views freely and assemble peacefully without fear of retribution.""
Despite sweeping economic reform and increasing openness to social change, Vietnam's Communist Party retains tight media censorship and does not tolerate criticism.
The United States has developed close ties with Vietnam in recent years, seeing it as an important regional partner in the face of China's rapid rise, but Washington has remained critical of Hanoi over human rights.
It has also criticized Hanoi over a cybersecurity law that tightens control of the internet and global technology companies operating in the country, raising fears of economic harm and a further crackdown on dissent. 
Vietnamese state media cited police as saying that Luong was a ""dangerous"" member of Viet Tan, a U.S.-based human rights group that Vietnam regards as a ""terrorist"" body.

New York-based Human Rights Watch has called the charges against Luong politically motivated.

1127,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 11:19AM ET</span>",Ex-cricketer Imran Khan elected prime minister of Pakistan,"By Asif Shahzad and Saad Sayeed
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistani lawmakers elected former cricket legend Imran Khan prime minister on Friday and he pledged to bring to justice ""all those who have robbed this country"" through corruption.
Parliament's move cleared the way for the 65-year-old Khan to set up a coalition government and his first major task will be to avert a brewing economic crisis after his party swept to election victory on July 25.
Khan saw his party sweep to victory in a July 25 general election promising to fight corruption and lift millions of people out of poverty. 
Pakistan has been plagued by boom-and-bust cycles and military coups since independence in 1947, as well as by Islamist militant violence in more recent years.
Khan, a firebrand nationalist, has promised to create millions of jobs and build world-class hospitals and school systems in the mainly-Muslim country of 208 million people. 
Among his first challenges will be to decide whether to request an International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout to ease currency pressures, or seek support from China and risk deepening Pakistan's economic dependence on its neighbor.
""I want to thank the people and I want to thank God for giving me the opportunity to bring change,"" Khan, wearing a black waistcoat over traditional white shalwar kameez robes, said in a speech in parliament. 
""First of all we have to do strict accountability,"" Khan added. ""Those who have robbed this country, I will hold each and every one of you accountable.""
In a sign of Pakistan's bitter political divisions, opposition lawmakers surrounded Khan and disrupted his speech throughout by shouting ""thief, thief Imran Khan"" and ""puppet"".
Khan's election was only the second democratic transfer of power since Pakistan's 1947 independence, and came at a time when relations with on-off ally the United States are fraying over alleged Pakistani support for militants waging war in Afghanistan. Islamabad denies aiding insurgents.
Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party holds 151 of the 342 seats in the lower chamber of parliament, short of a majority, but is expected to form a coalition government with smaller parties.
In Friday's lower house vote, Khan garnered 176 votes to defeat Shehbaz Sharif from the outgoing Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party, who won 96 votes. Khan, who will be sworn in on Saturday, has yet to announce his cabinet.
LEGISLATIVE HURDLES
His success in the election ended decades of political dominance by two dynastic powerhouses, the PML-N of three-time premier Nawaz Sharif, and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), founded and led by the Bhutto family.
But Khan will face a battle to push through his ambitious reforms and legislative agenda due to the thin majority in the National Assembly. The Senate, parliament's upper chamber, is controlled by the opposition.
""Legislative business will be difficult for him,"" said Raza Ahmad Rumi, editor of the Daily Times newspaper.
Opposition parties allege election rigging and say Khan's path to power was made easier by the tacit support of the powerful military, which has ruled Pakistan for nearly half its history. The army and Khan's PTI deny any collusion.
""The whole nation has rejected this election,"" said Shehbaz Sharif, demanding an investigation of electoral irregularities.
Murtaza Abbasi, a PML-N lawmaker, said in parliament Khan was ""brought here by aliens"", a euphemism for the military. 
Khan shot back that he had ""struggled 22 years"" to become premier. ""No military dictator raised me. I got here on my own.""
How Khan addresses historic civil-military tensions that have dogged successive governments could define his term.
No Pakistani premier has ever completed a five-year term in office, including Sharif, whose most recent stint in power was ended by the Supreme Court last year.
Sharif, who was jailed over corruption accusations several weeks before the election, saw his second stint in power ended by a military coup in 1999. 
CURRENCY CRISIS
The economy is likely to preoccupy Khan's first few months in office, with his administration facing a battle to reduce a ballooning current account gap and a high fiscal deficit, which shot up to 6.8 percent of GDP in the 12 months to end of June.
To deal with current account pressures Pakistan's central bank has devalued the rupee four times since December, while interest rates have been hiked three times this year.
A sharp increase in oil prices - Pakistan imports about 80 percent of oil needs - has contributed to a current account deficit that widened by 43 percent to $18 billion in the fiscal year that ended June 30. 
China has also provided billions of dollars in loans to shore up Pakistan's foreign currency reserves, which stand at just over $10.1 billion - enough to cover two months of imports. 

Earlier this week Asad Umar, widely expected to be appointed Finance Minister, told the English-language Dawn newspaper that Pakistan turning to the IMF would be a ""fallback option"" and that all other possibilities are being explored.

Captain Saiid Mohamed Diriye said his forces retook Af Urur without a fight. The town is important because the main road that links the cities of Garowe, Bosaso and the Somali capital Mogadishu passes nearby.
""The militants fled into the hills and we are pursuing them,"" Diriye told Reuters from Af Urur.
Al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab fighters had captured the town - which they and Puntland forces have fought over several times - last month, he said..
Al Shabaab wants to expel the African Union-mandated peace keeping force AMISOM from Somalia, topple its central government and establish an administration based on its strict interpretation of Islamic sharia law.
Attacks are relatively rare in Puntland, which has its own government and security forces patrolling its territory on the northeastern tip of the Horn of Africa, jutting out into the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea.

KAMPALA (Reuters) - European Union diplomats in Uganda on Friday deplored ""brutal treatment"" of lawmakers arrested over a stoning of President Yoweri Museveni's convoy, and a rights body called for Ugandan authorities to prosecute the perpetrators of the alleged abuses. 
Government spokesman Ofwono Opondo denied security personnel had deliberately beaten up the lawmakers and others. ""Some of these injuries could have been sustained in the course of the (convoy) confrontation,"" he said. 
Five lawmakers critical of Museveni were detained this week after supporters of an independent candidate participating in a parliamentary by-election threw stones at a passing presidential convoy. One person was shot dead in the incident.
On Thursday four of the detained lawmakers alongside dozens of others were charged with treason and unlawful possession of weapons and ammunition. Three of the detained lawmakers took part in the stoning, according to the charge sheet.
Opposition politicians and the defendants' lawyer have said the detained MPs and their co-accused were tortured during their arrest and detention.
""The reported brutal treatment of elected members of the Uganda parliament, journalists and civilians, as well as the loss of human life, are very disquieting events,"" the Kampala-based EU diplomats said in a joint statement.
""There is no room for repression nor violence in a modern democratic Uganda,"" said the statement, also signed by ambassadors of non-EU Norway and Iceland.
In power since 1986, Museveni has been accused by critics of using security forces to stifle opposition through intimidation, beatings, detentions and prosecutions on trumped-up charges.
His supporters say he has held power for so long in the East African country because of genuine mass support. 
Museveni has enjoyed Western support for having contributed to the fight against militant Islam, particularly through the Ugandan role in an African peacekeeping force in Somalia that has tackled al Shabaab jihadists.
POPULAR MUSICIAN AMONG THE ARRESTED
On Thursday, two lawyers who attended a military court session where one of the MPs, Robert Kyagulanyi, was brought in to be charged said he was unable to talk or walk, bore visible injuries and was not aware of his surroundings.
Security agents barred other people, including Kyagulanyi's wife and relatives, from attending the hearing.
Kyagulanyi, a popular musician known by his stage name Bobi Wine, was first elected to parliament last year. He has since amassed a large following among youth electrified by his scathing criticism of Museveni sometimes delivered in his songs. 
On Thursday, dozens of youths staged a protest in a suburb of the capital Kampala where Kyagulanyi has a recording studio. A police spokesman said 12 demonstrators had been arrested. 
Images have also emerged on social media of Francis Zaake, another detained member of parliament, lying on a bed, eyes closed, his face swollen and with wounds on his palm.
""If Kyagulanyi or any of the others arrested in Arua is in the condition his lawyers described, and prosecutors do not urgently work to bring torture charges against those accountable, it will make a mockery of Uganda’s constitutional provisions against torture...,"" said Maria Burnett, associate Africa director for New York-based Human Rights Watch.

He has denied wrongdoing in all three.
Authorities allege Netanyahu awarded regulatory favors to Bezeq Telecom Israel (TA:BEZQ) in return for more positive coverage of him and his wife on a news website owned by the company. 
Netanyahu, a conservative serving his fourth term as premier, said through a spokesman after around four hours of questioning that he was certain the probe, known as Case 4000, ""has finally collapsed"". 
His spokesman said that an overview of the website's reporting on the prime minister during the period in question showed that it had ""remained negative ... changing not a whit"".
Netanyahu has been questioned over the allegation several times.
He has sought to cast all three of the cases, and media coverage of them, as a politically motivated witch-hunt.
In the second investigation, known as Case 1000, he is suspected of bribery over gifts, which police say were worth nearly $300,000, from wealthy businessmen.
The third, Case 2000, involves an alleged plot to win positive coverage in Israel’s biggest newspaper by offering to take measures to curtail the circulation of a rival daily.
Police have recommended that Netanyahu be charged with bribery in both. 
The final decision about whether to prosecute him rests with the attorney general. That could be months away, and could in theory impinge on a national election scheduled for 2019. 
Polls indicate strong support for a fifth term for Netanyahu, but the probes have helped rally the center-left opposition. 
As police investigators arrived at the prime minister's official residence in Jerusalem, their car was thronged by anti-Netanyahu demonstrators who had unfurled a huge banner reading ""Crime Minister"". 

Police and the Israel Securities Agency said in a joint statement after Friday's questioning that it had been conducted as part of ""the effort against financial crime"". They did not elaborate on the case.

The story, covered by various Nigerian media outlets, disclosed a letter from national police chief Ibrahim Idris to Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, the Premium Times said. 
The newspaper said reporter Samuel Ogundipe was arrested on Tuesday for refusing to reveal the source of the letter, which identified who was blamed for a blockade on parliament last week by members of the Department of State Security.
Opposition lawmakers said the blockade was an attempt to intimidate its leaders but the presidency condemned the move and the acting president fired the head of the security agency. 
""Mr Ogundipe was released on Friday morning after he was granted bail,"" said the newspaper in a tweet, adding that his case had been heard a magistrate's court in the capital, Abuja. 
The newspaper did not state when the next court hearing would take place. 
Nigerian police said on Thursday Ogundipe was being prosecuted in relation to ""theft and unlawful possession of restricted and classified documents"" capable of compromising state security.
It said the charges against him were related to the official secret act and a cyber crime act.
The government led by President Muhammadu Buhari - a former military ruler - has frequently been accused of constricting press freedoms, which it has denied, and security services have often detained reporters. Nigeria ranks 119th out of 180 nations in Reporters Without Borders' World Press Freedom Index.
Amnesty International and the Committee to Protect Journalists have called for all charges against him to be dropped. They also called for him to be freed, prior to his release on bail. 
During the blockade, armed men wearing the black uniform of the Department of State Security stood at the gates of parliament in Abuja and were later joined by police officers blocking entry for up to an hour - evoking memories of the decades when the security forces held sway over politics.
The head of Nigeria's state security service, Lawal Daura, was fired by Osinbajo hours after the blockade. 
Ogundipe reported in the Premium Times that Idris had written to Osinbajo - in charge while Buhari takes a 10-day holiday - to say an investigation had concluded that Daura had been behind the blockade. 
The government has not responded to contents of the story. 
Earlier this week the DSS announced the appointment of a spokesman to improve transparency in the way the security agency operates. 
And, on Tuesday, Osinbajo ordered the overhaul of a special unit following allegations of repeated human rights violations that came to prominence in a social media campaign.

""The High Commissioner warns that the revocation will only serve to feed into the divisive, nationalistic rhetoric ahead of the general elections in October, and will disrupt any attempts to work towards reconciliation,"" U.N. human rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said on Friday.
The parliament of Bosnia's autonomous Serb Republic had on Tuesday voted in favor of the regional government reversing its previous acceptance of a report establishing that up to 8,000 Muslim Bosniaks were killed in and around Srebrenica in the weeks following the Bosnian Serbs' capture of the former U.N.-protected enclave in July 1995. [L5N1V561Q]
The government has confirmed it will carry out the revocation in coming days.
The motion in parliament was initiated by Serb Republic President Milorad Dodik and some analysts say it is the latest issue used by Serb ruling parties to mobilize voters around his nationalist agenda ahead of elections on Oct. 7.
More than two decades after Bosnia's 1992-1995 war ended, splitting the country into two ethnically-based regions, the Serb Republic and the Bosniak-Croat Federation, ethnic tensions remain high, halting progress towards membership of NATO and the European Union. 
Serbs in Bosnia and neighboring Serbia reject rulings by two war crimes courts, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Court of Justice, that the atrocity qualified as genocide.
""The High Commissioner fears that tensions, divisions and mistrust already perpetuated by some public and political officials and media organizations in Bosnia could be aggravated by this decision – which appears to be designed for political gain,"" Shamdasani said. ""He calls on the Republika Srpska to revisit the decision.""

The U.S. State Department said on Wednesday the vote was ""a step in the wrong direction"", aiming to revise the facts of the war, deny history and politicize tragedy. [L1N1V61Y9]

The South African Reserve Bank - which has been privately owned since it was established in 1921 - said on Friday the bill, if passed, would not affect its independence or primary mandate of price stability.
But the suggestion of following most countries by bringing the institution into state ownership was a sensitive one - particularly after the past administration was accused of meddling in the bank's appointments and decisions.
Malema's far-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party - with only 25 out of the country's 400 parliamentary seats - would have no chance of pushing the bill through on its own. 
But the ruling African National Congress (ANC) has backed the smaller party's bills before - including divisive legislation in February pushing to expropriate white-owned land without compensation.
The ANC promised on Friday to study the proposed privatization - a policy it had said it would pursue in December, when it called the central bank's ownership status a ""historical anomaly"". The party put the plan on the back-burner three months later, saying it needed more consultation.
UNFRIENDLY HEADLINES
The rand closed at 14.7275 versus dollar on Thursday and weakened further on Friday, driven by an emerging markets sell-off.
""With the independence of the central bank once again potentially in question, this combined with all of the other investor unfriendly headlines locally, (is) likely to keep the local unit on the back foot,"" Nedbank analysts said.
The bank's private shareholders have no control over monetary policy, financial stability policy or banking regulation.
On top of market concerns, the central bank has also warned that buying out those private shareholders would be expensive as some would likely sell their stakes at a premium.
Malema and his party did not make an immediate statement on their bill. But they have regularly argued for the nationalization of a wide range of assets - including mines and banks - and said the central bank should not be owned by private shareholders without a direct interest in the country.

The party - launched after Malema was expelled from the ANC in 2012 - has been pushing its plans to nationalize assets and to redress racial disparities in the build up to elections in 2019.

Brunson’s lawyer, Ismail Cem Halavurt said he’s considering renewing his bid for to secure the cleric’s freedom in the wake of the ruling by the court in the coastal city of Izmir. Brunson has been held for almost two years over what Turkey says was his role in a failed 2016 coup.
The decision sets the stage for a new round of sanctions by U.S. President Donald Trump. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Thursday the U.S. was ready to announce further sanctions if Erdogan refuses the quick release of the pastor. The specter of further punitive actions from Washington has kept the pressure on Turkish financial markets, along with the scheduled review of the nation’s debt later Friday by S&P Global Ratings.
While pledges by Treasury and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak Thursday and a crackdown on betting against the currency have helped the lira rebound this week -- after it lost a fifth of its value last week -- the prospect of renewed conflict with the U.S. again has markets on edge.
“It still looks like we’re headed to more conflict,” Kathy Jones, chief fixed-income strategist at Charles Schwab. “Neither side seems to be backing down yet.”
The lira weakened 5.2 percent to 6.1375 per dollar at 3:44 p.m. in Istanbul.

On Aug. 17 2017, a young man drove a rented van into crowds on a central boulevard, killing 14 and injuring over a hundred in Spain's worst attack in over a decade. Another man died during the attacker's getaway, and a woman was killed in a strike the following day in the coastal resort of Cambrils.
Spain's King Felipe, Queen Letizia and Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez joined the crowd for a ceremony at a central square where a choir sang and people read poetry in different languages. 
Families of the victims, many of them weeping, laid flowers at a mosaic on the Ramblas street where the van attack took place.
The relatives had asked for a truce for the occasion in the messy politics ensuing from a declaration of Catalonian independence last October which prompted Madrid to impose direct rule, but tensions crept in. 
One group marching down the Ramblas with anti-Spain banners traded insults with a group holding the Spanish flag and some of the rival camps pushed each other as police tried to maintain calm.
Catalan society is deeply divided over the question of independence, with a closely-watched poll from the Centro d'Estudis d'Opinio in July showing the proportion of Catalans who want to be an independent state at 46.7 percent. 
King Felipe, who made an unusual political intervention to criticize the independence drive, was met by both cheers and jeers when he arrived, and a banner reading ""The Spanish king is not welcome in the Catalan countries"" hung from one building. 
Sanchez has been working to defuse tension with regional authorities since taking over the premiership in June from Mariano Rajoy, whose government presided over a police crackdown on an Oct. 1 referendum. 
Some of the people attending Friday's events said they were not happy with the king's presence there.

""I absolutely disagree,"" said administrative worker Nati Puigbarraca. ""We all know what has happened in Catalonia, there is a political situation but it goes beyond that. Some of us will never forgive what happened on Oct. 1.""

1136,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 08:35AM ET</span>",Mexico union boss victory exposes crack in top graft cases,"By Michael O'Boyle and Stefanie Eschenbacher
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A Mexican court ruling allowing an ex-union boss to walk free of money laundering charges laid bare a serious flaw in a host of other high-profile corruption trials, officials and experts say, and underscored the challenge facing the incoming government.
Last week, former teachers union leader Elba Esther Gordillo walked when a judge dismissed charges that she laundered over $100 million in union funds to pay for luxury goods and plastic surgery.
Judge Miguel Angel Aguilar of Mexico City's first penal tribunal justified his decision, in part, using a November 2017 Supreme Court ruling that stated that prosecutors must first obtain court orders before requesting financial records, according to non-public court documents reviewed by Reuters.
The same argument could be brought to bear in other prominent investigations such as those into ex-state governors accused of embezzling public funds, a half-dozen government sources and legal experts consulted by Reuters said.
Mexico is awash with billions of dollars in illicit proceeds from drug trafficking, organized crime and theft of public money, but despite efforts to improve anti-money laundering laws, the country is failing to mount successful prosecutions.
Financial information has been obtained without court orders in thousands of cases under way or already resolved, said Jorge Lara, a former deputy attorney general.
Since Mexican law allows for jurisprudence that is favorable to defendants to be applied retroactively, many of those cases could be thrown out, he said.
""This is a really potent tool to topple cases,"" Lara said.
Public anger over corruption was a major factor in propelling leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to the presidency in the July 1 election. The Gordillo ruling shows that Lopez Obrador faces a tough task to fulfil his pledge to make corruption cases stick.
After a flurry of investigations toward the close of outgoing President Enrique Pena Nieto's six-year term, six former governors are in custody on pre-trial detention, according to watchdog group Mexicanos Contra la Corrupcion.
The case of Javier Duarte, a former Veracruz state governor accused of using fake companies to launder millions, has become a symbol of corruption under Pena Nieto.
Duarte, who denies wrongdoing, has been in prison since his arrest last year. His case is among those that could collapse due to the November Supreme Court ruling, according to two government sources with knowledge of the investigation.
A lawyer for Duarte declined to comment.
WEAK FOUNDATION
In Gordillo's case, Aguilar ruled that authorities did not have a court order before seeking private banking information in 2013 when she was arrested.
They therefore illegally obtained records on which to base their charges, court documents show. 
That applied the November Supreme Court decision, which was meant to be a check against abuses by prosecutors, said Angelica Ortiz, a former top official at Mexico's financial intelligence unit, the Finance Ministry's anti-money laundering arm.
Gordillo's case also shows how prosecutors are struggling with a new U.S.-style system of oral trials that gives defense lawyers more leeway to dismiss charges for procedural errors, said Carlos Perez, a lawyer and expert on money laundering.
""We are still not 100 percent ready for trials,"" Perez said. ""This is going to lead to not just letting the governors out, but also other types of criminals whose cases are under way.""
The new model is replacing an opaque inquisitorial system, and has put prosecutors on the back foot in the courtroom, said Javier Lopez, who runs the anti-money laundering committee at the Mexican Institute for Public Accountants.

Speaking of the prosecutions of the ex-governors, he said, ""The cases are not being put together properly.""

Germany deported Sami Aidoudi last month but a German court on Wednesday demanded his return, saying he may face torture in his native Tunisia, a concern the North African country denies.
Tunisian authorities initially detained Aidoudi after Germany deported him last month. It released him after two weeks for lack of evidence but has barred him from leaving the country pending the outcome of an investigation.
""The investigation is ongoing... His passport has been confiscated by a court (in case he gets charged),"" said Sofian Sliti, spokesman of Tunisia's anti-terrorist judiciary body.
""If there was a request from German authorities (to Tunisia) to hand him over it should come via diplomatic channels,"" he added, without elaborating.
A spokesman for the German government said Berlin was in constant contact with Tunis via its embassy there and would continue to discuss the case.
German opposition and rights groups criticized the decision to deport Aidoudi, saying he could face torture in his home country and citing a German court decision that he should be allowed to stay.
Aidoudi - referred to only as Sami A. in Germany - applied unsuccessfully for asylum there in 2006. German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, who has taken a tough line on immigration, accused him in May of having been bin Laden's bodyguard and said he should be deported.
Aidoudi always denied the allegation but was arrested in June and deported a month later on July 13.
Germany's interior ministry later denied opposition accusations that it had pressured authorities in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia to accelerate the deportation.
Tunisia has won praise for its transition since authoritarian leader Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali was ousted in 2011.
It has agreed on a constitution guaranteeing fundamental rights, held elections and largely avoided the political turmoil seen elsewhere in the region.
Human rights groups have on occasion accused members of security agencies of abuses against Islamist suspects - accusations denied by the authorities.

1139,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 07:26AM ET</span>",New U.S. training unit in Afghanistan faces old problems,"By James Mackenzie
CAMP DAHLKE, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Captain Joe Fontana, a team leader with the U.S. army's 1st Security Force Assistance Brigade, is part of a new unit but he is working on problems that have been stubbornly familiar to American military advisers in Afghanistan for years.
The 1st SFAB was formed last year as a new force of experienced advisers, to focus U.S. army training and support for Afghan troops and, in future, for other foreign armies.
It deployed to Afghanistan in March, putting U.S. advisers, previously largely restricted to Corps headquarters, together with front-line brigades and battalions for the first time since most international forces left in 2014.
The SFAB has arrived at a time of increasing pressure on the Afghan National Army (ANA) from Taliban fighters who overran a series of outposts and stormed the strategic city of Ghazni this week.
The problems they have found are the same ones that existed a decade ago when the NATO-led coalition began to reshape Afghan forces into an army on U.S. lines - poor logistics and organization as well as a reliance on static checkpoints that are vulnerable to attack.
Like other advisers, Fontana, who served in a combat unit in the southern Afghan provinces of Zabul and Kandahar in 2011-12 as well as in Iraq, speaks admiringly of the fighting spirit of Afghan soldiers.
But he said the army is dogged by persistent problems with supplies, maintaining equipment and making sure units get proper support, issues which for years have been an obstacle to creating Afghan forces capable of standing on their own.
""They're not scared of much, they will fight back fine, they're good shots. Some of their soldiers are pretty crack,"" Fontana told Reuters. ""But it comes down to logistics and mission command.""
The advisers help coordinate air strikes and other tactical support from U.S. forces and work with Afghan commanders on planning operations, frequently pressing them to move away from isolated checkpoints.
SFAB advisers also assisted the 203rd Corps, which is responsible for the volatile provinces south of Kabul, on the front lines in Ghazni.
But a large part of their work consists of helping commanders file requests for vehicle repair and ammunition resupply correctly or pushing units to carry out routine tasks like cleaning and maintaining their weapons and equipment.
It is the basic work of military organization and essential to ensuring army units function but it raises questions about why such problems persist despite the billions of dollars poured into training Afghan forces.
""Every kandak (battalion) we go to, regardless of where they're located, they all have major sustainment issues,"" said Command Sergeant Major Tim Bolyard, the senior non-commissioned officer in Fontana's battalion.
PURPOSE BUILT
After years of training missions by units thrown together for the purpose, the SFABs are supposed to bring more consistency to advising local forces in different parts of the world.
""We needed a purpose-built organization that's designed for advising,"" said Brigadier General Scott Jackson, the 1st SFAB's commander who was promoted this week.
The 1st SFAB, with some 800 advisers, most officers or NCOs with combat experience in Afghanistan or Iraq, is intended to be followed by five other brigades.
Working alongside mid-ranking and junior Afghan officers and soldiers, the aim is for them to obtain a better perspective on the real strength of Afghan forces.
It is a job needing patience and diplomacy, working through interpreters to coax sometimes reluctant commanders to abandon isolated checkpoints or try to develop their own solutions instead of relying on U.S. air strikes to defeat the enemy. 
During a visit to an outpost in the volatile province of Wardak this month, Fontana listened for 40 minutes while a battalion commander explained the problems he was having getting the ammunition his troops needed.
It was not clear whether the correct resupply forms had reached the right person at brigade headquarters and numerous calls ensued to try to find out. It is slow and sometimes frustrating work, but the trainers say it is vital if Afghan forces are ever to stand alone.
""An easy solution for me is, when I fly up there, to drag a couple of thousand pounds of ammunition in the bird (helicopter) and drop it off for them,"" Fontana said later.

""Great, but what does that achieve? Now you're having them become dependent on the U.S. and that is the wrong answer.""

Khan said he would consult the London Resilience Forum, which plans responses to disasters such as the Grenfell Tower Fire, about the implications for Britain of crashing out of the European Union without a deal, saying that such a ""catastrophic"" outcome looked more likely than ever. 
Britain is due to leave the EU in March 2019, and with time running out to secure agreement on future ties, both British and European politicians are warning of the increased chances of a ""no-deal"" Brexit.
""Even ministers now admit that crashing out of the EU with no deal is now more likely than ever,"" Khan said in a statement. ""We are now left with no choice but to plan for a no-deal scenario."" 
Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt told  ITV  (LON:ITV) News in an interview on Thursday that leaving the EU in a ""messy, ugly divorce"" would be a mistake that Britain would ""regret for generations"", although he tweeted on Friday to clarify that he believed Britain would ""survive and prosper without a deal"".
Denmark's finance minister Kristian Jensen told BBC radio he believed the odds that there would be no deal in Brexit negotiations were 50/50, echoing comments by Latvia's foreign minister earlier in the week.
Khan criticized the lack of engagement by the government with companies over preparations for a no-deal scenario. The government will start sending out advice to firms about such a scenario in August and September, a British official said.
Prime Minister Theresa May has repeatedly said that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed in Brexit talks, so a no-deal Brexit would jeopardize an accord reached, in principle, for a transition phase that would extend close ties to the bloc until December 2020.
Khan said he would consult businesses over their contingency plans, with agreement over the ""settled status"" of European employees dependent on successful talks with the EU over the future relationship with the bloc.

""I am calling on Theresa May to do the only sensible and humane thing and extend the offer of settled status to EU citizens currently living in the UK now, regardless of the outcome of the negotiations,"" Khan said.

1141,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 06:44AM ET</span>",The Rohingya lists: refugees compile their own record of those killed in Myanmar,"By Clare Baldwin
KUTUPALONG REFUGEE CAMP, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Mohib Bullah is not your typical human rights investigator. He chews betel and he lives in a rickety hut made of plastic and bamboo. Sometimes, he can be found standing in a line for rations at the Rohingya refugee camp where he lives in Bangladesh.
Yet Mohib Bullah is among a group of refugees who have achieved something that aid groups, foreign governments and journalists have not. They have painstakingly pieced together, name-by-name, the only record of Rohingya Muslims who were allegedly killed in a brutal crackdown by Myanmar's military.
The bloody assault in the western state of Rakhine drove more than 700,000 of the minority Rohingya people across the border into Bangladesh, and left thousands of dead behind.
Aid agency Médecins Sans Frontières, working in Cox's Bazar at the southern tip of Bangladesh, estimated in the first month of violence, beginning at the end of August 2017, that at least 6,700 Rohingya were killed. But the survey, in what is now the largest refugee camp in the world, was limited to the one month and didn't identify individuals.
The Rohingya list makers pressed on and their final tally put the number killed at more than 10,000. Their lists, which include the toll from a previous bout of violence in October 2016, catalog victims by name, age, father's name, address in Myanmar, and how they were killed.
""When I became a refugee I felt I had to do something,"" says Mohib Bullah, 43, who believes that the lists will be historical evidence of atrocities that could otherwise be forgotten.
Myanmar government officials did not answer phone calls seeking comment on the Rohingya lists. Late last year, Myanmar's military said that 13 members of the security forces had been killed. It also said it recovered the bodies of 376 Rohingya militants between Aug. 25 and Sept. 5, which is the day the army says its offensive against the militants officially ended.
Rohingya regard themselves as native to Rakhine State. But a 1982 law restricts citizenship for the Rohingya and other minorities not considered members of one of Myanmar's ""national races"". Rohingya were excluded from Myanmar's last nationwide census in 2014, and many have had their identity documents stripped from them or nullified, blocking them from voting in the landmark 2015 elections. The government refuses even to use the word ""Rohingya,"" instead calling them ""Bengali"" or ""Muslim.""
Now in Bangladesh and able to organize without being closely monitored by Myanmar's security forces, the Rohingya have armed themselves with lists of the dead and pictures and video of atrocities recorded on their mobile phones, in a struggle against attempts to erase their history in Myanmar.
The Rohingya accuse the Myanmar army of rapes and killings across northern Rakhine, where scores of villages were burnt to the ground and bulldozed after attacks on security forces by Rohingya insurgents. The United Nations has said Myanmar's military may have committed genocide.
    Myanmar says what it calls a ""clearance operation"" in the state was a legitimate response to terrorist attacks.
    ""NAME BY NAME""
Clad in longyis, traditional Burmese wrap-arounds tied at the waist, and calling themselves the Arakan Rohingya Society for Peace & Human Rights, the list makers say they are all too aware of accusations by the Myanmar authorities and some foreigners that Rohingya refugees invent stories of tragedy to win global support.
But they insist that when listing the dead they err on the side of under-estimation.
Mohib Bullah, who was previously an aid worker, gives as an example the riverside village of Tula Toli in Maungdaw district, where - according to Rohingya who fled - more than 1,000 were killed. ""We could only get 750 names, so we went with 750,"" he said.
""We went family by family, name by name,"" he added. ""Most information came from the affected family, a few dozen cases came from a neighbor, and a few came from people from other villages when we couldn't find the relatives.""
In their former lives, the Rohingya list makers were aid workers, teachers and religious scholars. Now after escaping to become refugees, they say they are best placed to chronicle the events that took place in northern Rakhine, which is out-of-bounds for foreign media, except on government-organised trips.
""Our people are uneducated and some people may be confused during the interviews and investigations,"" said Mohammed Rafee, a former administrator in the village of Kyauk Pan Du who has worked on the lists. But taken as a whole, he said, the information collected was ""very reliable and credible.""

    SPRAWLING PROJECT
    Getting the full picture is difficult in the teeming dirt lanes of the refugee camps. Crowds of people gather to listen - and add their comments - amid booming calls to prayer from makeshift mosques and deafening downpours of rain. Even something as simple as a date can prompt an argument.
What began tentatively in the courtyard of a mosque after Friday prayers one day last November became a sprawling project that drew in dozens of people and lasted months.
The project has its flaws. The handwritten lists were compiled by volunteers, photocopied, and passed from person to person. The list makers asked questions in Rohingya about villages whose official names were Burmese, and then recorded the information in English. The result was a jumble of names: for example, there were about 30 different spellings for the village of Tula Toli.
Wrapped in newspaper pages and stored on a shelf in the backroom of a clinic, the lists that Reuters reviewed were labeled as beginning in October 2016, the date of a previous exodus of Rohingya from Rakhine. There were also a handful of entries dated 2015 and 2012. And while most of the dates were European-style, with the day first and then the month, some were American-style, the other way around. So it wasn't possible to be sure if an entry was, say, May 9 or September 5.
It is also unclear how many versions of the lists there are. During interviews with Reuters, Rohingya refugees sometimes produced crumpled, handwritten or photocopied papers from shirt pockets or folds of their longyis.
The list makers say they have given summaries of their findings, along with repatriation demands, to most foreign delegations, including those from the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission, who have visited the refugee camps.
    A LEGACY FOR SURVIVORS
The list makers became more organized as weeks of labor rolled into months. They took over three huts and held meetings, bringing in a table, plastic chairs, a laptop and a large banner carrying the group's name.
The MSF survey was carried out to determine how many people might need medical care, so the number of people killed and injured mattered, and the identity of those killed was not the focus. It is nothing like the mini-genealogy with many individual details that was produced by the Rohingya.
Mohib Bullah and some of his friends say they drew up the lists as evidence of crimes against humanity they hope will eventually be used by the International Criminal Court, but others simply hope that the endeavor will return them to the homes they lost in Myanmar.
""If I stay here a long time my children will wear jeans. I want them to wear longyi. I do not want to lose my traditions. I do not want to lose my culture,"" said Mohammed Zubair, one of the list makers. ""We made the documents to give to the U.N. We want justice so we can go back to Myanmar.""
Matt Wells, a senior crisis advisor for Amnesty International, said he has seen refugees in some conflict-ridden African countries make similar lists of the dead and arrested but the Rohingya undertaking was more systematic. ""I think that's explained by the fact that basically the entire displaced population is in one confined location,"" he said.
Wells said he believes the lists will have value for investigators into possible crimes against humanity.
""In villages where we've documented military attacks in detail, the lists we've seen line up with witness testimonies and other information,"" he said.
Spokespeople at the ICC's registry and prosecutors' offices, which are closed for summer recess, did not immediately provide comment in response to phone calls and emails from Reuters.
The U.S. State Department also documented alleged atrocities against Rohingya in an investigation that could be used to prosecute Myanmar's military for crimes against humanity, U.S. officials have told Reuters. For that and the MSF survey only a small number of the refugees were interviewed, according to a person who worked on the State Department survey and based on published MSF methodology. 
MSF did not respond to requests for comment on the Rohingya lists. The U.S. State Department declined to share details of its survey and said it wouldn't speculate on how findings from any organization might be used.
For Mohammed Suleman, a shopkeeper from Tula Toli, the Rohingya lists are a legacy for his five-year-old daughter. He collapsed, sobbing, as he described how she cries every day for her mother, who was killed along with four other daughters.

    ""One day she will grow up. She may be educated and want to know what happened and when. At that time I may also have died,"" he said. ""If it is written in a document, and kept safely, she will know what happened to her family.""

The Jacksonville-based university said on Tuesday it had determined after ""careful consideration"" that the Confucius Institute, which opened a branch there in 2014 to promote language and culture, did not meet the university's mission.
A number of U.S. legislators, including Florida Senator Macro Rubio, have been critical of the more than 100 Confucius Institutes hosted at universities across the United States, saying that they are a vehicle of Chinese influence on international higher education.
""Some in the United States baselessly politicizing Confucius Institutes, a normal China-U.S. education and exchange program, is typical Cold War thinking and shows a lack of self confidence,"" China's foreign ministry said in a fax response to a Reuters question.
""We hope that the United States can properly regard the important work that the Confucius Institutes do to develop mutual respect and understanding.""
The University of North Florida said the closure was because the institute was not aligned with its goals and mission.
It did not elaborate only saying that the institute would be closed in February, once its legal obligation of six months' notice to end the contract was up.
Rubio has been among U.S. lawmakers warning that the Confucius Institute was an effort by China to expand its political influence abroad and had contributed to censorship on U.S. campuses. 
""I welcome the decision of @UofNorthFlorida to close its Confucius Institute. There is growing & well-founded concern about these Chinese Communist Party-funded Institutes. I continue to urge other FL universities to follow suit,"" Rubio said on Twitter this week.
Rubio and other lawmakers have pursued legislation that would require universities to disclose major gifts from foreign sources, at a time when U.S. politicians, including President Donald Trump, but also many Democrats, have been pushing a harder line in dealing with China.
U.S.-China relations have suffered in recent months, with the two countries locked in an increasingly bitter trade dispute.
Several other universities in Florida still host the Confucius Institute, among more than 100 such centers around the United States.

Autostrade per l'Italia, controlled by infrastructure group Atlantia, manages the section of the A10 motorway linking the French border to the port city, where the bridge gave way on Tuesday, killing at least 38 people.
The bridge had presented problems since soon after it was completed in 1967 and some of the stays were reinforced as early as the 1990s, experts have said.
Atlantia had no immediate comment on the reports in La Stampa and Repubblica newspapers, which cited a study by engineers at Milan's Politecnico university in November 2017.
Autostrade has said it monitored the bridge on a quarterly basis as required by law and that it had carried out additional checks by hiring external experts.
The newspaper reports said the university study had found that the stays of the section of the bridge that later collapsed reacted to vibration ""in a way that does not entirely conform with expectations and requires further investigation.""
The study said the anomaly in the stays' reaction may have been linked to corrosion of metal in some cables.
One of the peculiarities of the bridge was that its cables were wrapped in concrete, making it hard to assess their state.
The newspapers said the company announced a 20 million euro ($23 million) tender in May this year as it planned to strengthen the stays that had not been reinforced in the 1990s.

SAN FRANCISCO/WEST PALM BEACH (Reuters) - For two months in detention after being separated from her 14-year old son by U.S. border officials, Catalina Sales worried about how he was doing and when she would see him again.
On July 25, they were finally brought back together at a facility near El Paso, Texas. The reunion was happy but brief.
Sales, who entered the United States illegally on May 30, made a difficult choice: She refused to sign a paper agreeing that if she were deported, her son Yaiser would accompany her back to Guatemala. She wanted to give him the chance, she said, to pursue asylum in the United States even if she is sent back.
Because of that, she and her son were separated again after just two hours together, and he was sent back to the Florida children's facility where he had previously been held. 
The decision that kept them separated also gave her son a better chance of being allowed to stay in the U.S. legally, a Reuters analysis of data from the courts' Executive Office for Immigration Review suggests.
More than 2,500 families were separated at the U.S.-Mexico border in the spring as part of a zero-tolerance policy toward illegal immigration that ended in June. By separating them from their parents, the government rendered the children “unaccompanied minors,” which conferred certain advantages on them under U.S. immigration law, including a different, more child-friendly asylum process not available to children never separated from their families. 
Additionally, a network of immigration lawyers specializing in children often agree to represent unaccompanied minors for free. And should they fail at an initial hearing with an asylum officer, the children have the opportunity to present their claims anew before an immigration judge.
Overall, although this was not something Sales could have known when she made her decision, unaccompanied children from the so-called Northern Triangle of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras win their immigration cases more than twice as often as others from those countries, Reuters’ analysis found. In the last three years, 40 percent of unaccompanied children from the countries were allowed to remain in the United States compared to 19 percent for others from the countries.
There is no record of how many separated parents have opted for their children to pursue separate asylum proceedings even if it meant leaving them behind. But at least six other reunited families with Sales in El Paso on July 25 made the same decision she did, according to Taylor Levy, legal coordinator at the Annunciation House in El Paso, which is working with the parents.
Both Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE)and the Department of Health and Human Services, which arranges care for children in immigration custody, declined to comment on the Sales’ case.
On Thursday, a San Diego federal judge said the form given to separated parents to sign did not constitute a legally valid waiver of their children’s asylum claims and ordered their deportations temporarily halted until the issue was resolved. The form “was not designed to advise parents of their childrens’ asylum rights, let alone to waive those rights,” wrote Judge Dana Sabraw in his order. 
'HE WANTS A BETTER LIFE'
After being reunified that day in El Paso, parents and children were loaded on a bus and asked to sign papers agreeing to be deported with their children. Those who refused to sign, including Sales, were led off the bus, according to interviews with four detainees and a court filing, leaving their children behind.
Sales said that after speaking to Yaiser for two hours on the bus, she realized she could not sign papers that might forfeit her son’s chance to remain in the United States and study instead of returning to Guatemala, where they were unsafe and Yaiser had fewer educational opportunities. 
“He told me that he wanted to stay, that he didn’t want to go back, but that he wanted me to stay with him.... I felt sad,” Sales told Reuters by phone from the immigration detention facility where she is being held. “The simple truth is he wants a better life.” 
Sales remains hopeful that both of them will eventually be granted asylum and allowed to stay in the United States. If her asylum claim is unsuccessful, she hopes her son's will succeed, and that he can live with his aunt and uncle, who have applied to sponsor him.
In an interview with Reuters from the Florida facility where he is being housed, Yaiser said that he and the other re-separated children on the bus that day were sad when their parents were taken away again. 
“We started crying because we couldn’t say goodbye after we’d only seen them for a short time.”
Two other fathers on the bus with Sales told Reuters they felt pressured by immigration officials to choose the option of being deported with their child. 
“They told us … this was the only option,” said one of the fathers, who spoke on condition that he be identified only by his initials, S.T. 
At a July 31 congressional hearing, ICE official Matthew Albence denied that officials were coercing people into agreeing to deportation.
Albence told Congress that many parents want their children to stay in the United States. “A great many of these individuals do not wish to have their child returned home with them,” he said. “The reason most of them have come in the first place is to get their children to the United States” and many have spent their life savings to do so, he said.
The government said 154 parents had decided against reunification as of August 16, according to a court filing. The filing doesn't include the parents' reasons. 
'IT WOULD BE SAFER'
Another father on the bus, identified in court documents only by his initials J.M., spoke to Reuters about his reason for not agreeing to be deported with his 16-year-old son. 
“The problem with Honduras is that they recruit them for gangs, and I didn’t want that for him,” he told Reuters from detention. “Of course, I would have preferred to be with my son, but I made that choice for his well-being. I have to accept that.” His son was returned to the Casa Padre youth shelter in Brownsville, he said.
During their reunion on the bus, Yaiser told his mother he wanted to stay in the U.S. to study and make her proud, Sales said. But he also told her he hoped she could stay with him because “it would be safer.”
Yaiser’s attorney, Jan Peter Weiss, visited him at the Florida facility on Saturday. “He is very sad,” said Weiss. “He asked about his mother every other sentence. ‘Is my mother alright? What do you think is going to happen to her?’”

Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, the law firm representing Sales, declined to comment for this story.

GENOA (Reuters) - Rescue workers searched through tons of concrete and steel from the collapsed Genoa highway bridge for a fourth day on Friday as Italians prepared to bury the 38 victims of a disaster that has angered the public and rattled industry.
A fire among the rubble held up part of the operation, sending clouds of white smoke up before being extinguished. A spark from metal cutting equipment was thought to have caused the blaze that started in a warehouse under the ruined bridge. 
The confirmed death toll from the collapse of a 200-meter (660-foot) stretch of the bridge on Tuesday that sent vehicles plummeting 50 meters (165 feet) to the ground, remained at 38, but officials have said there still may be 10-20 people missing.
More than 600 people had to leave their apartments below the remaining spans of the bridge for fear of further collapse. Officials have decided the buildings will be demolished as it would be too dangerous to leave them there.
A state funeral for most of the victims is due to be held on Saturday morning at the port city's Exhibition and Trade Centre, led by Genoa's archbishop, Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco, and attended by President Sergio Mattarella and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.
But some families have said they will boycott the event and hold their own private services, as a sign of protest against what they say was negligence that caused the bridge to collapse.
The government has declared Saturday a national day of mourning. The state funeral will be televised live and state broadcaster RAI said will not air any advertising as a sign of respect for the victims.
Shares in the parent company of Autostrade per l'Italia which runs the highway plunged more than 30 percent in the days after the collapse, but were recovering slightly on Friday as investors said government threats to revoke its concessions might be political rhetoric rather than a likely outcome.
Atlantia shares were up 6 percent on Thursday's close by 0900 GMT, still down almost 22 percent from their level the day before the disaster.

The Transport Ministry has given Autostrade 15 days to show it had met all its contractual obligations, and wants the company to rebuild the bridge at its own expense.

The Taliban's five-day siege of Ghazni eased on Wednesday after Afghan officials declared that they had regained complete control of the city by killing hundreds of Taliban fighters.
Ghani met officials in Ghazni, a central Afghanistan city on the main highway linking the capital, Kabul, with the south, to assess security, and also met families of the victims and prayed for the deceased.
""I am here to help all those who have suffered losses, I am committed to build the city and also do everything to protect Ghazni,"" Ghani said after arriving in the city.
""Our soldiers have fought bravely and we stand committed to bringing peace,"" he said.
The assault on Ghazni exposed the fragile grip Ghani's Western-backed government has on security and its apparent inability to prevent large-scale attacks.
It also came as Ghani's government and its international partners had been pushing for a second cease-fire during next week's Eid holiday.
Thousands of Taliban insurgents entered Ghazni after destroying checkpoints, killing dozens of Afghan soldiers and police officers, cutting communications and the highway.
Police retreated after the assailants captured government offices and police headquarters, a senior security official in Kabul said. The insurgents roamed freely around Ghazni, destroyed shops, forced civilians to cook, and used some as human shields during the clashes. 
Afghan soldiers, backed by U.S. forces, drove the Taliban fighters out of the once-bustling city, which lay in a shambles, after five days of fighting.
Officials working in the presidential palace said the devastation and trauma inflicted on thousands of Ghazni residents required urgent domestic and international support.
""The five-day war has come to an end but the complex process of rebuilding the city and protecting it from fresh attacks begins now,"" said a senior official in Ghani's office in Kabul.
International aid organizations said medical supplies, food and water would be provided to thousands of residents and that ambulances were transporting the wounded to hospitals.

""Several wounded civilians were forced to sit inside homes as they could not come to the hospital during the clashes, we are now treating them,"" said Saiyed Ahmed, a doctor at the Ghazni provincial hospital.

1150,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 12:50AM ET</span>","Japan ministries may have inflated numbers of disabled employees, media say","TOKYO (Reuters) - Several ministries in Japan may have inflated their numbers of disabled employees for more than four decades, media said on Friday, while companies that miss quotas set by law face fines.
Japan, reeling from data-tampering scandals at companies ranging from Kobe Steel to Nissan Motor that prompted government inquiries, has asked all government ministries and agencies to recheck their employment numbers.
Since 1976, both the public and private sectors have been told to employ a certain percentage of the disabled, as part of efforts to provide them employment and stamp out discrimination. 
But several agencies may have overstated their numbers of disabled employees since the quotas were first adopted, including those with minor disabilities not officially certified as such, several media said.
Actual employment of disabled who qualify for the quotas may have been less than half the 2.5 percent reported last June by central government agencies, the Tokyo Shimbun newspaper said.
If true, that implies a shortfall from the requirement of 2.3 percent. The private sector must meet a lower figure of 2 percent, missed last year by a small margin. This April the quotas were raised to 2.5 percent and 2.2 percent, respectively.
The labor and welfare ministry confirmed the request for a recheck of all 34 government ministries and agencies.
A labor ministry official, Takanori Yoshida, said the request was prompted by suspicion of ""a misunderstanding"" over the categories of candidates qualifying for the disabled quota, going by the queries the ministry received from some agencies.
The ministry planned to announce its findings as soon as possible, Yoshida added, but did not elaborate.

The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the measure aims to curb a surge in immigration from crisis-stricken Venezuela that has driven hundreds of thousands of desperate migrants to Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Chile and Brazil.
Ecuador and Peru now allow Venezuelans to enter with only their national ID cards. That has been a significant advantage for Venezuelan migrants, who struggle to obtain passports amid chronic shortages.

Tepco, the utility that owns the plant hit by a tsunami in 2011 that set off meltdowns, has been widely criticized for its treatment of workers and its handling of the cleanup, which is expected to take decades.
In a statement on Thursday, the U.N. experts urged Japan to act urgently to protect tens of thousands of the workers from reported exploitation and radiation exposure, citing fears over possible coercion and adequate training and protective steps.
Japan is conducting reliable management of radiation levels for Fukushima workers, however, and had already informed the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights of this, along with data, the Foreign Ministry said on Friday.
""The fact that this statement was issued despite this is extremely regrettable, and this was conveyed to the OHCHR in Geneva on Thursday,"" it added.
The U.N. rights experts had said they were engaged in a dialogue with Japan since last year, with the government accepting to ""follow up"" on some recommendations.

A Reuters investigation in 2013 had found widespread labor abuses, including workers who said their pay was skimmed and spoke of scant scrutiny of working conditions. Tepco, or Tokyo Electric Power Co Holdings, said at the time it was taking steps to limit worker abuse.

1153,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 10:47PM ET</span>","In India's citizenship test, a spelling error can ruin a family","By Zeba Siddiqui
DHUBRI, India (Reuters) - Riyazul Islam says he had to produce family documents going back to 1951 to prove he was an Indian and not an illegal Bangladeshi immigrant. But a draft list of citizens released in July excluded him and his mother, among a total of about 4 million people left off.
A wiry 33-year-old living in the northeastern state of Assam, Islam says he and his mother have no further documents left to prove they are Indians, although his father and many others in his family have been included in the National Register of Citizens (NRC).
""If my father is an Indian citizen how come I am not?"" said Islam in an interview in the small Assam town of Dhubri, close to the border with Muslim-majority Bangladesh. ""What more proof do they need?""
Anguish like this is now commonplace in Assam, where the Hindu nationalist government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi accelerated work on the citizen's list after coming to power in the state two years ago, promising to act against immigrants accused of stealing jobs and resources from locals.
The government has not given details of the four million excluded from the list. But most are believed to be minority Bengali-speaking Muslims living in the state, which has a total population of 33 million, mostly Assamese-speaking Hindus. 
Many of those excluded are illiterate and poor, and some are victims of a spelling error in their names or a mistake in their age in documents offered for proof of citizenship, according to a review of their documents by Reuters. 
Opposition parties say Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is denying citizenship to Muslims through the Assam list, and demonstrating its Hindu nationalist credentials with an eye on a general election due by May.
The BJP's Assam spokesman, Bijan Mahajan said there was no religion-based motive behind the citizenship drive.
""(This is) being opposed for political mileage whereas at ground zero there is absolutely no tension,"" he said.
However, Arun Jaitley, one of Modi's senior-most cabinet colleagues, said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post this month that the NRC was necessary because the growth in the Hindu population of Assam had been overtaken by that of Muslims.
Ethnic Assamese have been agitating against outsiders in the state for decades. In 1983, about 2,000 people were chased down and killed by machete-armed mobs intent on hounding out Muslim immigrants. It has not been clearly established which group was behind the carnage.
The Assam NRC draft has excluded many Hindus too, but last weekend BJP chief Amit Shah assured citizenship to all non-Muslim refugees from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan by framing a new law.
It is not clear what will happen to those excluded from the final list of citizens. But lawyers say they may end up in detention camps, or at the very least be denied citizenship rights and government subsidies. 
They could also be struck off voter rolls, which will be an important factor in at least half a dozen Assam constituencies in a general election.

SPELLING ERRORS
In Dhubri, a farming town on the northern bank of the Brahmaputra River upstream from the Bangladesh border, those who did not make it to the list were fearful of discussing it in public. 
But inside their homes, several of those excluded showed a Reuters reporter tattered pieces of paper, including birth, school and marriage certificates dating back years and preserved carefully in plastic envelopes.
Such government-issued documents in the countryside often contain spelling or numerical errors, as the illiterate depend on others to write down details. Getting birth certificates made was also not common until recent years in many parts of the country.
Such mistakes can lead to loss of citizenship, said Aman Wadud, a lawyer who has handled dozens of cases of illegal immigration at Assam's foreigner tribunals.
""With Muslims, there is a problem of title (surnames),"" said Wadud. ""Because most of the accused are illiterate they don't use a constant title. Ali, Ahmed, Hussain are used interchangeably."" 
He showed Reuters a tribunal judgment on a resident named Tajab Ali, who submitted a series of voters lists as proof of his citizenship going back to 1966. He said his name had been wrongly recorded as Tajap Ali instead of Tajab Ali in the 1985 voters list, and his father's name wrongly recorded as Surman Ali Munshi instead of Surman Ali. There were also discrepancies in his age.
The tribunal said Ali submitted an affidavit ""declaring various names of himself, his projected father, and mother. But an affidavit being only a self declaration, it has no evidentiary value.""
Sajida Bibi, Islam's mother, also fell victim to a wrongly entered name. 
One of the documents she submitted to prove citizenship, and shown to Reuters by the family, was an affidavit saying her name had been wrongly recorded as ""Sabahan Bibi"" in the 1951 citizenship registry, the first one drawn up in the state after India's independence in 1947. The affidavit also said she was named as ""Sahajadi Begum"" in her school certificate, and that she changed her name to ""Sajida Bibi"" from ""Sajida Begum"" after her marriage. 
She swore in the affidavit that all three were the same person – her. The tribunal did not accept the affidavit.
Reuters reviewed copies of at least two other recent tribunal judgments in which people had been declared foreigners because of name and age-related errors and in which affidavits were not accepted.
""NOT AGAINST MUSLIMS""
Much of the over 2,500-mile-long border between India and Bangladesh is porous, through which hundreds of thousands of people fled from Bangladesh during its India-backed war of independence from Pakistan in 1971.
To be recognized as Indian citizens, all residents of Assam have had to produce documents proving that they or their families lived in the country before March 24, 1971.
New Delhi said in 2016 that around 20 million illegal Bangladeshi migrants were living in India. Activists who filed a petition in the Supreme Court in 2009 to expel such immigrants alleged over 4 million of them had been included in Assam's 2006 voter list.
""For 38 years, we've been fighting to protect the language, culture and identity of our indigenous people in our own motherland,"" said Samujjal Bhattacharya, an adviser to the All Assam Students Union (AASU), an organization that has spearheaded the campaign against illegal immigrants.
But Bhattacharya said the NRC was not biased against any community.

""It's not against Muslims, it is not against Hindus, it is not against Bengalis,"" Bhattacharya said. ""It's against illegal Bangladeshis. It is a question of citizens and non-citizens.""

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Nine planes were forced to make emergency changes to their routes within Chilean, Argentine and Peruvian airspace on Thursday because of bomb threats issued to Chile's civil aviation authority, its director general told journalists. 
At least two of the planes were operated by LATAM Airlines and three by Sky, a low-cost Chilean airline, the companies confirmed. 
Victor Villalobos Collao, the director general of Chile's civil aviation authority (DGAC), said 11 threats were made in total on Thursday, two of which were ""fictitious"" and nine of which related to existing flights. 
All of the planes were declared free of explosives, and at least one plane was later allowed to resume its flight, he said.
He said calls warning of bombs onboard flights were made to LATAM's offices, and the civil aviation authority, and police were now trying to trace their origin. 
""We always have an abandoned suitcase or two, that's normal,"" he told journalists in a briefing at Santiago airport. ""But this is a totally exceptional case."" 
For four of the flights, Santiago, Chile's capital, was either the origination or the destination, the DGAC added in a statement. 
One flight, Sky 162, took off from Santiago's Arturo Merino Benítez airport and was headed to the northern city of  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO) when it was instructed to return to Santiago, the statement said. 
Flight LATAM 2369, originating from Lima, the capital of Peru, and heading for Santiago, was forced to land in the southern Peruvian city of Pisco, it added.
Peru's transport ministry said no one had been injured and a team for deactivating explosives has been notified. ""Right now the situation is under control,"" it said on Twitter.
Another Sky flight, Sky 524, is understood according to flight schedules to have taken off from the Argentine city of Mendoza. It made an emergency landing in Santiago before proceeding to Rosario in Argentina, the DGAC said.
Sky said another of its planes, Flight 166, was prevented from taking off from Santiago because of a bomb threat. 
In addition, LATAM 800, which according to flight schedules took off from Auckland, New Zealand, performed an emergency landing in its destination of Santiago. That flight was still undergoing security checks, the DGAC added. 
Collao said other flights were checked in Iquique, another city in northern Chile, Antofagasta and Mendoza, without giving further details.
LATAM confirmed that at least two of its planes had been affected. ""The affected passengers will be transferred by LATAM onto other flights,"" it said. ""The authorities have not at this moment found any evidence that might put passengers at risk."" 

Chilean police did not respond to a request for comment.

(Reuters) - Leaders of the Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on Thursday called on people to stop referring to the faith as Mormonism, although the church acknowledged one of its central texts would still be called the Book of Mormon.
An online guide accompanying a pronouncement from the church president also asked people to stop referring to followers of the religion as Mormons and not to use the name ""LDS"" as a shorthand way of describing the faith. 
""The Lord has impressed upon my mind the importance of the name He has revealed for His Church, even The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,"" church President Russell Nelson said in a statement. ""We have work before us to bring ourselves in harmony with His will.""
Leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have long proclaimed their faith as Christian and fought any association with polygamy, which was practiced by early members of the church before they abandoned it more than 100 years ago.
Their latest campaign is related to those twin goals, said professor Patrick Mason, the chair of Mormon studies at Claremont Graduate University. 
""For many years now, the church has wanted to insist that it is a Christian church,"" Mason said, ""and a common formulation, especially among evangelical Christians, is that Mormons are not Christians.""
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has about 16 million followers worldwide.
Thousands of others in North America, who are often called fundamentalist Mormons, practice polygamy, Mason said.
The emphasis on the full name of the church is one way for its leaders to distance themselves from those breakaway groups, he said. 
The push by Nelson, who became president of the church in January, to discourage use of the term Mormon follows a similar campaign ahead of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Utah, according to the Salt Lake Tribune.
But that campaign had limited staying power, even within the church. The latest statement from Nelson was posted at mormonnewsroom.org and the church is still using the related site, lds.org, despite its disavowal of the term ""LDS."" 
A representative for the church could not be reached for comment. 
Mason, who is Mormon, said he still expected to use the term Mormon, despite the campaign by church leaders.

""I think the likelihood of it sticking outside the church is low to negligible,"" Mason said.

""This significant contribution is critical to stabilization and early recovery efforts and comes at an important time in the campaign,"" the State Department said in a statement.
It said Islamic State's territory is down to 400 square miles (1,000 square km) in Syria and nearly 150,000 people have returned to the city of Raqqa after the militant group fled.
While the State Department welcomed Riyadh's contribution, it called on U.S. partners and allies ""to do their share in this effort that helps bring greater stability and security to the region."" 
""Stabilization and early recovery programming is critical to ensure ISIS cannot reemerge and use Syria as a base to threaten the people of the region or plot attacks against the international community,"" the statement said.

The Saudi contribution comes as President Donald Trump's administration is looking to bypass the U.S. Congress to reduce foreign aid spending, including funds for programs in Syria, the West Bank and Gaza.

BELIZE CITY (Reuters) - Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen arrived in Belize on Thursday as she seeks to shore up dwindling alliances in the face of pressure from China to stamp out the island's international recognition.
Belize is one of 18 remaining countries that recognize Taiwan, with Burkina Faso and the Dominican Republic shifting diplomatic ties to China earlier this year.
The Caribbean country's decision to ditch Taiwan came after Panama, which turned from Taiwan to Beijing in June 2017.
Tsai arrived in Belize on Thursday for her first state visit to the tiny Central American country after a stop in the United States and ahead of a visit to Paraguay. She met privately with Belize's foreign minister and other government officials.
Later she was expected to receive the ""Order of Belize,"" an honor awarded to foreigners, before speaking on Friday to Belize's House of Representatives.
In a statement issued prior to Tsai's visit, the Taiwanese embassy emphasized that the trip would reaffirm the strength of the island's relationship with Belize, with which it has maintained diplomatic ties since October 1989.
Belize ""remained Taiwan's staunch ally in its bid for participation in U.N. agencies,"" the statement said, adding: ""Taiwan is Belize's loyal and trustworthy ally.""
Belize's Minister of Foreign Affairs Wilfred Elrington told Reuters this month that he was ""very content with the relationship we have with Taiwan.""
Taiwan offers Belize financial aid in the hundreds of millions of Belize dollars, ranging from scholarships to agricultural aid and healthcare, Elrington said.

Taipei has struggled internationally to maintain diplomatic relations with an increasingly assertive China, despite efforts in recent years to strengthen ties with generous aid packages.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China's military has expanded its bomber operations in recent years while ""likely training for strikes"" against the United States and its allies, a Pentagon report released on Thursday said.
The assessment, which comes at a time of heightened U.S.-China tensions over trade, was contained in an annual report that highlighted China's efforts to increase its global influence, with defense spending that the Pentagon estimates exceeded $190 billion in 2017.
""Over the last three years, the PLA has rapidly expanded its overwater bomber operating areas, gaining experience in critical maritime regions and likely training for strikes against U.S. and allied targets,"" the report said, using an acronym for China's People's Liberation Army.
The report comes as China and the United States plan to hold trade talks, offering hope they might resolve an escalating tariff conflict that threatens to degenerate into an all-out trade war.
The report said that while the PLA had continued to extend operations, it was not clear what message Beijing was seeking to send by carrying out the flights ""beyond a demonstration of improved capabilities.""
The Chinese embassy in Washington could not immediately be reached for comment.
This year China’s air force landed bombers on islands and reefs in the South China Sea as part of a training exercise in the disputed region.
In January the Pentagon put countering Beijing, along with Russia, at the center of a new national defense strategy.
While Washington and Beijing maintain a military-to-military relationship aimed at containing tensions, this has been tested in recent months, notably in May when the Pentagon withdrew an invitation to China to join a multinational naval exercise.
In June, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis became the first Pentagon chief to visit China since 2014.
The Pentagon report said that despite a projected slowdown in economic growth, China's official defense budget would be more than $240 billion by 2028.
The Pentagon report also said China's space program was progressing rapidly.
""The PLA continues to strengthen its military space capabilities despite its public stance against the militarization of space,"" it said. 
This month, President Donald Trump’s administration announced an ambitious plan to usher in a new ""Space Force"" as the sixth branch of the military by 2020.

One of the arguments in favor of developing such a force is that American rivals like China appear increasingly ready to strike U.S. space-based capabilities in the event of a conflict.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States warned Turkey on Thursday to expect more economic sanctions unless it hands over detained American pastor Andrew Brunson, as relations between the two countries took a further turn for the worse.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin assured President Donald Trump at a Cabinet meeting that sanctions were ready to be put in place if Brunson was not freed.
""We have more that we are planning to do if they don't release him quickly,"" Mnuchin said during the meeting.
The United States and Turkey have exchanged tit-for-tat tariffs in an escalating attempt by Trump to induce Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan into giving up Brunson, who denies charges that he was involved in a coup attempt against Erdogan two years ago.
""They have not proven to be a good friend,"" Trump said of Turkey during the Cabinet meeting. ""They have a great Christian pastor there. He's an innocent man.""
In a tweet later on Thursday, Trump said the United States ""will pay nothing"" for Brunson's release, ""but we are cutting back on Turkey!"" He called Brunson ""a great patriot hostage.""
Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, had issued a blunt warning to Turkish ambassador Serdar Kilic when he met him on Monday at the White House, an administration official said on Thursday.
When Kilic sought to tie conditions to Brunson's release, Bolton waved them aside and said there would be no negotiations.
""Release Brunson,"" Bolton told him, according to the official, who declined to be named. 
Turkey has sought to persuade the United States to spare Turkey's state-owned Halkbank from a threatened fine for allegedly helping Iran evade U.S. sanctions. Ankara also wanted Washington to hand over Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania and who Turkey suspects of plotting the coup against Erdogan. Gulen denies the allegations.
""They missed a big opportunity. This is very easy to resolve,"" the administration official said. ""They made a big mistake trying to tie this to other things.""
The dispute over Brunson and other frictions between Washington and Ankara have been one reason the Turkish lira has plunged 40 percent this year. Investors also fret over Erdogan's influence over monetary policy. 
The lira lost strength after Mnuchin's remarks.

Trump, who has doubled steel and aluminum tariffs on Turkey, said the steel tariffs had kicked in and the aluminum tariffs would take effect soon.

QUITO (Reuters) - Ecuador on Thursday said that Venezuelans entering the country would need a passport from Saturday, an apparent attempt to curb a rising influx of migrants fleeing their homeland. 
Members of the Andean Community - which includes Venezuela and Ecuador - have an existing agreement that allows citizens to cross borders between member countries with only their national ID cards. That has been a significant advantage for Venezuelan migrants, who struggle to obtain passports amid chronic shortages.
""As of this Saturday the government will require that anyone entering Ecuador present his or her passport,"" said Interior Minister Mauro Toscanini on Thursday.
The Foreign Ministry later issued a statement saying the measure applied specifically to Venezuelans, adding that their national ID cards were often deteriorated and lacked the necessary security features.
Venezuelan migrants have been taking days-long bus rides across South America, often crossing Ecuador on their way south to Peru or Chile, because they cannot afford flights on a minimum wage that adds up to a few U.S. dollars a month.
Quito declared a state of emergency in three provinces this month after a spike in Venezuelan migrants crossing the Ecuadorean-Colombian border high in the Andean mountains. Authorities said up to 4,500 Venezuelans were crossing daily, compared with around 500 to 1,000 previously.
Ecuador's President Lenin Moreno is left-wing like his Venezuelan counterpart Nicolas Maduro, but he has distanced himself from Caracas since taking office last year. The migration wave has also soured public opinion toward Venezuela in the country of some 16 million. 
The Ecuadorean government does not provide data on the total number of Venezuelans living in the country, but an official at the Foreign Ministry told local radio that some 600,000 Venezuelans had entered the country so far this year, with around 109,000 staying on. 

Venezuelans begging or selling knickknacks are now a common sight in Quito. And as in much of Latin America, some locals fret that desperate Venezuelans are undercutting the job market.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday named senior policy adviser Brian Hook as Washington's special representative for Iran.
The move came as the Trump administration prepared to increase economic pressure on Iran by restoring sanctions to force Tehran to end its nuclear weapons program and support for militant groups in the Middle East.
Hook will lead a newly established Iran Action Group to coordinate the State Department's pressure campaign on Iran, Pompeo told a news conference.
The announcement was not a surprise. Hook, who has pushed for tough action against Iran, has been leading the department's talks with allies in Europe and Asia to persuade them to support U.S. sanctions and cut off Iran's oil supplies as of November.
""The Iran Action Group will be responsible for directing, reviewing and coordinating all aspects of the State Department's Iran-related activity, and will report directly to me,"" Pompeo said.
""We are committed to a whole-of-government effort to change the Iranian regime’s behavior, and the Iran Action Group will ensure that the Department of State remains closely synchronized with our interagency partners,"" he added.
President Donald Trump announced in May the United States was withdrawing from an Iran nuclear deal sealed in 2015 between Tehran and six world powers. The United States has said it would only end the sanctions if Iran allowed the negotiation of a tougher deal.
Hook, who was a close adviser to former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, worked with U.S. national security advisor John Bolton on Iran sanctions while Bolton was the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations under Republican President George W. Bush.
Hook also served as an assistant secretary of state during Bush's administration and was an adviser to the Republican presidential campaigns of Mitt Romney and Tim Pawlenty.
Trump has said he would be willing to meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, although Tehran said the way back to talks was for the United States to return to the nuclear deal.
Asked whether he supported such a meeting and whether his brief would be to set up those talks, Hook said if Iran showed that it was willing to change its behavior, then Trump ""was prepared to engage in dialogue in order to find solutions.""
Washington aims to force Tehran to end its nuclear program and its support of militant groups in the Middle East, where Iran is involved in proxy wars from Yemen to Syria.
Iran and other signatories, including Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China, have been working to find a way to salvage the nuclear agreement, even as the United States has started reimposing some sanctions on Iran.
Dennis Ross, a former U.S. official in Democratic and Republican administrations, said Hook's new post might be a bureaucratic maneuver to try to inject more clarity into Washington's policy toward Tehran.
""It creates an address within the administration for ... making the approach a more coherent one, with someone being given broader responsibility across departments to try to shape the policy,"" said Ross, now a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy think tank. ""At least that would be theory.""

""The real question is ... is the policy going to continue to be just, basically, strong tough rhetoric and sanctions ... or is it going to be something more"" to curtail what Washington sees as Iran's destabilizing actions in Syria, Yemen and Iraq?"" he added.

1163,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 06:37PM ET</span>",Vatican voices 'shame and sorrow' over damning sex abuse report,"By Philip Pullella and Scott Malone
VATICAN CITY/BOSTON (Reuters) - The Vatican expressed ""shame and sorrow"" on Thursday over revelations that Roman Catholic priests in Pennsylvania sexually abused about 1,000 people over seven decades, vowing to hold abusers and those who protected them accountable.
In a long statement that broke the Vatican's silence over a damning U.S. grand jury report that has shaken the American Church, spokesman Greg Burke said the Holy See was taking the report ""with great seriousness"".
He stressed the ""need to comply"" with civil law, including mandatory reporting of abuse against minors and said Pope Francis understands how ""these crimes can shake the faith and spirit of believers"" and that the pontiff wanted to ""root out this tragic horror"".
The grand jury on Tuesday released the findings of the largest-ever investigation of sex abuse in the U.S. Catholic Church, finding that 301 priests in the state had sexually abused minors over the past 70 years. It contained graphic examples of children being groomed and sexually abused by priests.
""The abuses described in the report are criminal and morally reprehensible. Those acts were betrayals of trust that robbed survivors of their dignity and their faith,"" Burke said.
""The Church must learn hard lessons from its past, and there should be accountability for both abusers and those who permitted abuse to occur,"" he said.
His statement came hours after U.S. bishops called for a Vatican-led probe backed by lay investigators into allegations of sexual abuse by former Washington Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who resigned last month.. The Vatican did not directly address their request.
Pope Francis accepted McCarrick's resignation in July after American church officials said allegations that he sexually abused a 16-year-old boy almost 50 years ago were credible and substantiated. 
McCarrick was possibly the first cardinal to resign since French theologian Louis Billot, who according to the National Catholic Reporter, a US newspaper, left over a disagreement with Pope Pius XI in 1927. 
""The overarching goal in all of this is stronger protections against predators in the Church and anyone who would conceal them, protections that will hold bishops to the highest standards of transparency and accountability,"" Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said in a statement.
The bishops said they would create a new way to report accusations of sexual abuse by clergy members and for claims to be investigated without interference from bishops overseeing priests accused of sex abuse. They said it would involve more church members who were not clergy but had expertise in law enforcement or psychology.
Nick Ingala, a spokesman for Voice of the Faithful, a group formed to promote parishioners' voices after the abuse scandal surfaced, said it was heartening that bishops wanted to set up an independent review process but he expressed skepticism that it would be successful.
""I don't know how they are going to work that out,"" Ingala said in a telephone interview. ""I'm always hesitant to give 100 percent credence to any plan the bishops put forth based upon experiences in the past.""
The Pennsylvania grand jury report was the latest revelation in a scandal that erupted onto the global stage in 2002, when the Boston Globe newspaper reported that for decades, priests had sexually assaulted minors while church leaders covered up their crimes.

Similar reports have emerged in Europe, Australia and Chile, prompting lawsuits and investigations, sending dioceses into bankruptcy and undercutting the moral authority of the leadership of the Catholic Church, which has some 1.2 billion members around the world.

1164,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 06:31PM ET</span>",Brazil court seen keeping Lula off ballot but party could win,"By Anthony Boadle
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's top electoral court has been handed a hot potato as it must decide whether the country's most popular politician can run in upcoming elections despite being jailed for corruption.
The court is expected to declare former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva ineligible in the coming weeks, ahead of the Oct. 7 vote, but that may not stop his Workers Party (PT) winning anyway.
Justice Rosa Weber, who heads the court, has said it will quickly make a decision that political analysts expect will come before campaign advertising on TV and radio begins on Aug. 31.
Few in Brazil doubt Lula will be barred from running under a ""Clean Slate"" law that bans politicians from seeking public office if they have been convicted of a crime and it has been upheld on appeal.
""There is no doubt he will be disqualified. It is a legal fact. After all it was he who signed the Clean Slate into law,"" said Senator Katia Abreu, a farm lobby leader and vice presidential candidate for PT rival the Brazilian Labor Party.
If the electoral court bans Lula, his lawyers are expected to appeal to the Supreme Court. 
That could suspend his ban, which could delay his case beyond a Sept. 17 deadline for changing names on the ballot. 
""Lula will try to delay a final ruling as far as possible, but the Supreme Court will uphold the TSE decision,"" said Ricardo Ismael, politics professor at the Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro.
The PT registered the leftist leader's candidacy on Wednesday, with thousands of supporters chanting ""Free Lula"" outside the electoral court. Lula's running mate Fernando Haddad, a former Sao Paulo mayor, will head the ticket if he cannot run.
INHERITING LULA'S VOTES
In Brazil's most uncertain election in decades, Haddad is running a distant sixth in polls, far behind front-running far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who has capitalized on voter anger with political corruption and rising crime. 
With Lula's endorsement, Haddad would become a competitive candidate if he is able to attract a good part of the popular leftist's voters. Lula leads all polling when his name is included, taking about 30 percent of the vote, according to pollster Datafolha.
In a fragmented field of 13 presidential hopefuls, Haddad could make the run-off between the two most voted candidates with as little as 15 percent of the votes, experts say.
""If Haddad can transfer half of Lula's 30 percent, he can become a competitive candidate and get to the second round,"" said Lucas de Aragão, at Brasilia consultancy Arko Advice.
Voters in the poorest region of Brazil, Lula's native Northeast, which accounts for 26 percent of the electorate, remain extremely faithful to the president who greatly improved their quality of life and purchasing power, Ismael added.
Abreu argued that Haddad was an unknown quantity in the Northeast and that voters will back her presidential candidate, center-leftist Ciro Gomes, who is also from the Northeast, or the environmentalist Marina Silva.

""Nobody votes by power of attorney. They cannot even pronounce Haddad's name properly in the Northeast,"" she said.

1165,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 06:07PM ET</span>","U.S., ACLU agree on plan to reunite separated immigrant families","By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - The U.S. government has largely reached an agreement with immigrant rights advocates on a revised plan for reuniting hundreds more families separated by border officials after they crossed into the United States from Mexico.
In a Thursday court filing, U.S. Department of Justice lawyers said the changes would ensure an ""efficient process"" for reunifications, without requiring that parents removed from the United States be returned for that purpose.
But lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union said in a separate filing that some families could be ""made whole"" only if parents were returned to the country, and the failure to address their rights was a ""significant"" area of dispute.
They said this nevertheless should not impede ""swift reunification efforts,"" and that they ""agree to the plan as revised,"" including its provisions for locating and interviewing removed parents.
The plan is the second stage of government efforts to reunite 2,551 children with their parents, after they had been separated under U.S. President Donald Trump's now-abandoned ""zero tolerance"" policy toward illegal immigrants.
U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw in San Diego ordered the reunifications on June 26 and must approve any reunification plan.
As of last week, 559 children remained separated. Many of those separated had crossed the border illegally, while others had sought asylum at a border crossing.
An update on the reunification process is expected later Thursday, and a hearing is scheduled for Friday.
The reunification plan outlines means to locate removed parents, determine their intentions for their children, and address concerns about children's safety and parentage.
Thursday's revised plan contains dozens of changes.
One new provision would require the government to arrange travel for children being reunited with their parents in their countries of origin.
Another would ensure that such reunifications would not impair those children's future ability to seek asylum if they returned to the United States.
Justice Department lawyers urged Sabraw not to adopt a position taken by immigrant rights advocates in similar lawsuits pending in San Diego and Washington, D.C.
They said those advocates want to grant children of removed parents a legal right to demand their return to consult on asylum and related proceedings.
The government ""strongly disputes"" that this right exists, and believes granting the request would ""directly and significantly interfere"" with the reunification process, its lawyers said.

Trump abandoned the separation policy on June 20 after broad criticism at home and internationally.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Six months after Brazil sent in federal forces to take control of security in Rio de Janeiro state, both murders and the number of people killed in police confrontations have risen, official data shows, raising questions about the strategy. 
President Michel Temer on Feb. 16 announced emergency measures authorizing the army to take command of police forces in Rio de Janeiro state, where warring drug gangs and militias have driven a sharp rise in violence. 
In the first six months of the federal intervention, however, there were 3,479 murders in the state, up nearly 5 percent compared with the same period last year, according to official state data. 
Between February and the end of July, 738 people were killed in confrontations with police, the data examined by Reuters shows, up more than 35 percent from the previous year. Between February and last month, 16 police officers were killed, one fewer than in the 2017 period.
""It's very worrying, this scenario, in which the most sensitive indicators are getting worse, and we have a security policy that is focused on deepening the very issues that cause violence, such as confrontations and gun battles,"" said Silvia Ramos, a coordinator of the Center for Security and Citizenship Studies in Rio de Janeiro.
Growing violence has become a key issue ahead of October elections, with candidates from across the political spectrum seeking to play up their crime-fighting credentials and appeal to an electorate fed up with a weak economy and endemic graft. 
Although polls show most people in Rio de Janeiro state support the federal intervention, few discern much improvement since it began, and it has been widely criticized for a lack of transparency and unclear goals. 
In a statement, the federal intervention office highlighted crime statistics that had fallen, such as cargo and car thefts, adding that ""the tendency is for the reduction of the indices to proceed in the coming months.""
In an interview before the six-month anniversary, the federal intervention's spokesman, Roberto Itamar, said much of the government's work had focused on administrative and logistical fixes that would take longer to be perceived. 
He added that the hardest part of the government's work in the state was to repair relations between the people and their police. 

""Over the course of various years (that relationship) has been weakened,"" he said. ""Mutual trust needs to be built.""

1170,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 03:21PM ET</span>",Turkey will emerge stronger from lira crisis despite row with U.S.: minister,"By Daren Butler
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Finance Minister Berat Albayrak assured international investors on Thursday that Turkey would emerge stronger from its currency crisis, insisting its banks were healthy and signaling it could ride out a dispute with the United States.
In a conference call with thousands of investors and economists, Albayrak - who is President Tayyip Erdogan's son-in-law - said Turkey fully understood and recognized all its domestic challenges but was dealing with what he described as a market anomaly.
With Ankara locked in a complex rift with Washington, he also played down a decision by President Donald Trump to double tariffs on imports of Turkish metals. Washington later said it was ready to impose further economic sanctions on Turkey. 
Many countries had been the target of similar U.S. trade measures, Albayrak said, and Turkey would navigate this period with other parties such as Germany, Russia and China. 
Turkey, he said, has no plans to seek help from the International Monetary Fund or impose capital controls to stop money flowing abroad in response to the recent collapse of its lira currency.
Before he spoke, the lira strengthened more than 3 percent, despite signs that the dispute with the United States is as wide as ever.
The lira held steady during Albayrak's conference call but later weakened when Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the United States was prepared to levy more sanctions on Turkey if detained American pastor Andrew Brunson was not freed.
The Turkish currency was trading at 5.85 at 1740 GMT, more than 1 percent stronger on the day. Turkey's sovereign dollar bonds extended their gains. 
The lira hit a record low of 7.24 to the dollar earlier this week, down 40 percent this year, as investors fretted over Erdogan's influence over monetary policy and the row with the United States.
Turkey's foreign minister said Ankara did not want any problems with Washington.
""We can solve issues with the United States very easily, but not with the current approach,"" Mevlut Cavusoglu told a news conference in Ankara late on Thursday.
Facing Turkey's gravest currency crisis since 2001 in his first month in the job, Albayrak has the daunting task of persuading investors that the economy is not hostage to political interference.
Albayrak, a 40-year-old former company executive with a doctorate in finance, said Turkey would not hesitate to provide support to the banking sector. The banks were capable of managing the volatility, and there had been no major flow of cash out of deposits lately, he added.
QATARI PLEDGE
Economists gave Albayrak's comments a qualified welcome, and praised his ambition to get inflation down into single figures next year from above 15 percent now. But his father-in-law's opposition to higher interest rates may complicate that quest.
""He said all the right things, but it's one thing saying them and another thing doing them,"" said Sailesh Lad at AXA Investment Managers. ""He said capital controls weren't part of the agenda, and never will be. I think a lot of the market liked hearing that."" 
The lira gained some support from the announcement late on Wednesday of a Qatari pledge to invest $15 billion in Turkey.
Trump has used trade tariffs in a series of disputes ranging from with Turkey and China to the European Union. 
In a sign that Turkey may hope to make common cause with other affected countries, Erdogan and French President Emmanuel Macron spoke by phone on Thursday, discussing developing economic and trade ties and boosting bilateral investment, a Turkish presidential source said.
Albayrak will also meet his German counterpart Olaf Scholz in Berlin on Sept. 21.
However, in a potential complication, a foreign ministry source in Berlin said Turkish police had arrested a German citizen. ARD TV reported the man was accused of ""terrorist propaganda"" after criticizing the government on social media.
In another element of the row with Washington, a U.S. court sentenced a senior executive of state-owned Turkish lender Halkbank to 32 months in prison in May for taking part in a scheme to help Iran evade U.S. sanctions.
That case has increased speculation that the bank itself could be fined for sanctions-busting.
Halkbank has said all of its transactions were lawful and Albayrak played down the risk. ""We are not expecting any fines on Halkbank for sure,"" he said. ""But hypothetically speaking, ...if one of our public banks need help, the government will stand strong by it for sure.""
The White House said on Wednesday that it would not remove steel tariffs on Turkey, appearing to give Ankara little incentive to work for the release of Brunson, a pastor on trial in Turkey on terrorism charges.
Washington wants the evangelical Christian freed but Turkish officials say the case is a matter for the courts. 
The pastor row is one of several between the NATO allies, including diverging interests in Syria and U.S. objections to Ankara's ambition to buy Russian defense systems, that have contributed to instability in Turkish financial markets.

ECONOMIC WAR
Erdogan has repeatedly told Turks to exchange gold and hard currency into lira, saying the country was involved in an economic war with enemies.
However, Turks appeared not to be heeding his appeal. Central bank data showed foreign currency deposits held by local investors rose to $159.9 billion in the week to Aug. 10, from $158.6 billion a week earlier. 

Erdogan has called for a boycott of U.S. electronic goods and Turkish media have given extensive coverage to anti-U.S. protests, including videos on social media showing Turks apparently burning dollar bills and destroying iPhones.

Sebastian Vall, 21, was arrested on Monday at the crossing point of Murriqan with Montenegro after he boarded a bus in neighboring Kosovo, where he had procured the handguns. 
He had hidden the 7.65 mm black-and-silver pistols among his clothes in a big blue bag when the bus bound for Germany was searched with sniffer dogs at Murriqan, Albanian police said.
Wearing a red T-shirt and green shorts, Vall was ordered by the court to await trial in jail after he said he had flown from Sweden to Turkey and then to Kosovo, where he waited four days to obtain the guns.
He said he did not know the identities of either the prospective buyer of the pistols in Sweden nor the seller in Kosovo, according to Albanian media reports from the Serious Crimes Courthouse.
""I was just going to carry them to Sweden. I did it for money because I was unemployed. I wanted to study but had no money so I agreed to do it,"" Vall said.
He was charged with international weapons trafficking, a charge punishable from seven to 15 years if convicted.
Albania and Kosovo, which were hit by civil unrest and armed conflict respectively in 1997 and 1999, are awash with guns, as is the rest of the Balkans following the 1990s wars that broke up Yugoslavia.

KABUL (Reuters) - Gunmen attacked an area around a security base and training center for Afghanistan's intelligence service in the capital Kabul on Thursday, holding off security forces for hours before being killed.
The incident comes at a time of high tension after a series of attacks across Afghanistan, including a full-scale assault on the city of Ghazni by the Taliban last week that killed as many as 150 civilians and destroyed houses and a local market.
There was no immediate word on any casualties from Thursday's attack, the latest in a long series to target military and intelligence facilities in Kabul. 
Islamic State issued a statement claiming responsibility in a statement on its Amaq news agency.
Staff and officials at the training center took shelter in a protected area of the compound as gunfire came from a half-finished building near the site.
Kabul police spokesman Hashmat Stanekzai said the attackers had fired rocket-propelled grenades as well as automatic rifles, and that security forces had held back from assaulting the building where the gunmen had taken position.
Afghan Special Forces, backed by advisers from the NATO-led Resolute Support mission, surrounded the site and kept the attackers in a standoff for hours, with the occasional sound of gunfire or explosions.
After some seven hours, officials said the two attackers were killed.
Separately on Thursday, Islamic State also claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing in Kabul that tore through an educational center on Wednesday where teenagers had been studying for a university entrance examination.
The public health ministry has put the death toll at 40, and rights group Amnesty International condemned the attack as a ""war crime"".
GHAZNI CALM AFTER FIGHTING
In Ghazni, heavily damaged by five days of heavy fighting this week, there were warnings of the danger posed by unexploded ordnance and there were still problems with water and power but otherwise the situation was calm.
""Clearing operations in Ghazni continue, but violence in the city, which is recovering from the Taliban's aftermath, has abated and the city remains quiet,"" said Lt. Col. Martin O'Donnell, spokesman for U.S Forces-Afghanistan.
The latest fighting has raised questions over prospects for peace talks between the Taliban and the Western-backed government ahead of next week's Eid al-Adha, a major annual Muslim festival.
Taliban officials have told Reuters the movement's leadership was considering a ceasefire, following a three-day truce during the Eid al-Fitr holiday in June, but there has so far been no confirmation.
The last Eid truce, which saw unarmed Taliban fighters mingling with soldiers and police in Kabul and other cities, offered a rare glimpse of peace and Taliban officials say they have held preliminary meetings with U.S. diplomats.

KAMPALA (Reuters) - Three Ugandan lawmakers and dozens of others critical of President Yoweri Museveni have been charged with treason over their alleged role in the stoning of his convoy earlier this week.
Another lawmaker was charged separately in a military court martial.
One of the vehicles in the long-ruling Museveni's convoy had its rear windscreen smashed when he traveled late on Monday to campaign for a ruling party candidate in a parliamentary by-election in the northern town of Gulu. 
Museveni said on Wednesday he was unharmed, but five MPs were arrested in the moments after the incident.
Three of them, including the independent Kassiano Wadri who won the by-election, appeared in court in Gulu and were charged together with dozens of others.
They were accused of ""intent to do harm to the person of the president,"" according to the charge sheet, which also said they ""unlawfully aimed and threw stones, thereby hitting and smashing the rear windscreen of the presidential car"".
A magistrate told the defendants they could not enter pleas as their offense, classified as treason under the penal code, could only be heard in a higher court. He ordered that they be detained until Aug. 30. 
Medard Sseggona, a lawyer for the defendants, told the magistrate that some of the accused had been ""badly beaten and tortured during the process and after arresting them"" by soldiers.
He asked the magistrate to allow the sick among the accused to have immediate access to medical care. That request was granted.
Two other lawmakers, Francis Zaake and Robert Kyagulanyi, a popular musician-turned-politician who goes by the stage name Bobi Wine, did not appear in court.
On Wednesday, a leading opposition figure said Zaake had been severely beaten, as unverified images purportedly of Zaake lying on a bed emerged on social media.
Relatives and opposition MPs who traveled to Gulu to attend the court proceedings said they had been denied information on the whereabouts of Zaake and Kyagulanyi.
A statement from the Ugandan military late on Thursday said Kyagulanyi had been arraigned in a court martial in Gulu, charged with unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition, and would be held until Aug. 23.
Under Ugandan law, civilians found in possession of materials typically reserved for the armed forces are tried by courts martial.
Rights activists have long accused Museveni's government of using tactics including beatings by security forces and detentions to stifle opposition to his rule. 
Museveni has been in power for more than 30 years and officials say he has broad public support.

Last year parliament, dominated by Museveni's party, scrapped an age limit of 75 on candidates for the presidency, a move critics say means Museveni could potentially rule for life.

Cairo has brokered an interim truce that has allowed commercial goods into Gaza ahead of the Muslim Eid al-Adha feast which starts next week.
""We are putting the final touches to the terms of the truce that will be signed by all sides, and we expect to announce the terms next week if Fatah helps us to do so,"" the source said, referring to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's mainstream party which dominates the occupied West Bank.
Officials from Fatah have not joined those of Hamas, which runs the Gaza Strip, and other Palestinian factions for the talks in Cairo on the long-term truce.
But Fatah's backing is crucial for any deal as the party retains a large presence in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip and has overall control in areas under Abbas's Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank.
""The period of calm will be for one year, during which contacts will be held to extend it for another four years,"" the source told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
A long-term truce could pave the way for talks on other issues, including the easing of a blockade that has crippled Gaza's economy and allowing a possible swap of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the bodies of two Israeli soldiers. 
The source said Egyptian intelligence chief, Abbas Kamel, was expected to meet Abbas in Ramallah after similar talks in Israel, and a deal could be announced by next week. An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed Kamel had met with Netanyahu in Israel this week, but gave no details.
A Palestinian source in Ramallah said Kamel has left without seeing Abbas, who had been preoccupied with a Palestinian leadership conference. But the source said Abbas had informed Egypt that Fatah representatives would join the Cairo talks later this week or next week.
EASING BLOCKADE
Apart from the opening of its Kerem Shalom commercial crossing into Gaza, Israel also expanded the enclave's fishing zone, in waters under Israeli naval blockade, from three to nine nautical miles off the southern coast and to six nautical miles in the north, according to the head of Gaza's fishermen's union.
The Egyptian security source said the extended truce would also include opening a sea lane from Gaza to Cyprus under Israeli supervision.
A Palestinian official in Gaza familiar with the talks said Palestinian factions were demanding a ""total lifting of the blockade on Gaza, opening all crossings with Israel and Egypt and a water corridor"".
Israel says its blockade is a self-defense measure against Hamas, a group that has called for its destruction.
Israel's security cabinet, a forum of senior ministers headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, discussed the Gaza situation on Wednesday and an Israeli ""diplomatic official"" said Hamas would have to prove its commitment to the truce. 
As well as wanting calm along the border, Israel has said Hamas must return the remains of two soldiers killed in the 2014 Gaza war and release two civilians whose fate is unknown. It says they are being held by Hamas in Gaza.
""That's the only way,"" Israeli Regional Cooperation Minister Tzachi Hanegbi, a member of Netanyahu’s security cabinet, said on Thursday when asked if a broad arrangement depended on the return of the soldiers' bodies.
""Nothing will be done to enable (Gaza's) significant rehabilitation and the improvement of infrastructure and ports and other such fantasies, unless they release the bodies and the two Israeli captives,"" he told Israel radio.
The Egyptian security source said the long-term truce would also envisage Israel freeing hundreds of detained Palestinians in a prisoner swap.
However, the Palestinian official denied any talks were taking place on a swap, saying Hamas opposed mixing the issues.
Egypt has brokered a Palestinian reconciliation agreement that provides for Hamas to cede control of Gaza to Abbas's Palestinian Authority. A dispute over power-sharing has hindered implementation of the deal, but the Egyptian source said Cairo was still seeking progress on the issue.

The questioning of Peter Beinart at Ben Gurion Airport on Sunday prompted the Israeli security agency Shin Bet, in a statement issued by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, to describe the incident as ""an administrative mistake"".
After Beinart, a columnist with the Jewish daily Forward, went public with his experience, several other liberal or pro-Palestinian activists - both foreigners and Israeli citizens - said that they had been similarly treated at Ben Gurion.
""This is stupidity,"" Regional Cooperation Minister Tzachi Hanegbi said when asked about the airport interrogations of left-wingers. ""It cannot be explained. It is folly, ridiculous.""
""I am certain that now there will be someone who stands there and will check that such stupidity does not recur,"" Hanegbi told Israel's Channel 13 television.

Security screening at Ben Gurion has always been stringent, but left-wing activists accuse authorities of subjecting them to scrutiny on political grounds as the right-wing Netanyahu government tries to counter pro-Palestinian boycott campaigns against Israel.

""It has never been in our plans and it is not in our plans. There will be no federal election this fall,"" Trudeau told a news conference as he visited the province of Quebec.
Trudeau's center-left Liberals are facing challenges on trade and immigration and are essentially tied in opinion polls with the right-leaning Conservative opposition.
A prominent Toronto Star columnist, Chantal Hebert, wrote on Monday that Canadians deserved a fall election because the political context has changed so dramatically since Trudeau was elected with a surprise majority three years ago.
Most notably, the Canada-U.S. relationship has soured since Republican President Donald Trump took office in 2017 and sparked the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between Canada, Mexico and the United States. Trump has since imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada and other countries.
The United States is Canada's largest trading partner, taking some 75 percent of its goods exports.
Trudeau is also under pressure at home, with a dramatic shift in the political leadership of key provinces away from his Liberal party, setting the stage for a heated battle over climate change and carbon pricing.
Trudeau shuffled his cabinet in July, stressing the need to diversify trade away from the United States while leaving key ministers in place. [nL1N1UE0I2]

The Canadian Broadcasting Corp's poll tracker, an aggregation of the latest federal opinion polls, in July showed the Liberals with 36.4 percent support, the Conservatives with 34.7 percent, and the left-leaning New Democrats with 19.1 percent support.

F-16 fighter jets bombed and destroyed an ""operations room"" where the militants were meeting. Islamic State, which once occupied a third of Iraq's territory, has been largely defeated in the country but still poses a threat along its border with Syria.
""According to intelligence, those terrorists who were killed were planning criminal operations using suicide vests and intended to target innocents in the next few days inside Iraq,"" the military said in a statement.
The Iraqi military has carried out several air strikes against Islamic State in Syria since last year, with the approval of President Bashar al-Assad and the U.S.-led coalition fighting the militants.
Iraq has good relations with Iran and Russia, Assad's main backers in the Syrian war, and also enjoys strong support from the U.S.-led coalition.
Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared final victory over Islamic State in December but the group still operates from pockets along the border with Syria and in a rugged mountainous area in northeastern Iraq.
It has continued to carry out ambushes, killings, and bombings across Iraq since it abandoned its goal of creating a self-sufficient caliphate straddling Iraq and Syria.

The anti-Islam PEGIDA movement organized the protest against Merkel and her decision in 2015 to welcome about one million refugees mainly from Muslim countries. Merkel's move caused a rise in anti-immigrant sentiment and helped lift the far right into the national parliament after elections last year.
They chanted ""Merkel must go!"" and ""Get lost"" as she arrived in Dresden in the formerly communist east of Germany where far right views are more widespread than in the west of the country.
There were also counter-protesters in the vicinity but no clashes or other incidents had been reported so far, a police spokesman said. He declined to give figures of the protesters.
Merkel has repeatedly defended her decision to admit hundreds of thousands of migrants as a humanitarian necessity, but has since vowed to prevent a repeat of such a situation and to battle the root causes of migration into Europe.
The anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party benefited from migration concerns as it became the third largest party in the national parliament last year and complicated Merkel's efforts to re-establish a stable governing coalition.
Saxony will vote for a new state parliament in September 2019 and polls suggest that the AfD could become the second-strongest party, with the CDU likely to come in first.

Merkel was expected to address reporters later on Thursday after her meeting with CDU lawmakers in Dresden.

1179,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>","Exclusive: As Syria looks to rebuild, Finance Minister sees trade boost from forex deposits","By Kinda Makieh
DAMASCUS (Reuters) - Syria will use new foreign currency certificates of deposit to help fund trade operations, its finance minister said, as the government takes tentative steps towards reconstruction following seven years of war.
Authorities in Damascus allowed the central bank this month to begin issuing the certificates. 
""It has no relation to reserves. This will contribute to enabling the central bank to finance foreign credit line operations and import operations,"" Mamoun Hamdan told Reuters in an interview.
He said economic activity had picked up significantly since Russia entered the war on the government side in 2015, but did not put a figure on the increase. ""We cannot compare it (the growth rate) because we cannot compare zero to another number.""
In its early stages, the war shattered Syria into a patchwork of areas held by different forces. It has killed hundreds of thousands of people and forced more than half the pre-war population from their homes. 
Since Russia's entry turned the tide in 2015 President Bashar al-Assad's favor, the government has gradually retaken much of the country, including its major cities, though large areas still remain outside its control. 
""The liberation (of areas held by rebels or Islamic State) will bring in vast funds for the treasury. It is true that this (military operation) costs money, but it will economically reactivate these regions,"" Hamdan said. 
A report by the U.N.'s Arab countries agency ESCWA cited experts as saying the volume of destruction of Syria's physical capital and its sectoral distribution exceeded $388 billion. 
One of the ways military success helped the economy was via upgrades to electricity supplies in areas the government controls. Last year the army recaptured gas fields that produce fuel for power stations. 
""Now in Syria in most areas which need electricity, and especially in the industrial cities, there is 24-hour power,"" Hamdan said.
He said the relative stability of Syria's currency during the conflict ""gave advantages to investors"". 
Hamdan said the certificates of deposit, aimed at domestic banks, would pay 4.25 percent interest for a minimum deposit of $1 million or 1 million euros. Banks will offer lower rates to individuals depositing foreign currency with them. 
While Assad's allies Russia and Iran have invested in Syria, United States and European Union sanctions - which bar all dealings with the government and numerous individuals and companies - have kept most Western companies out.
Calling the sanctions ""unilateral and unjust"", Hamdan said they penalized the Syrian people just as much as its government and army.
The U.S. already had sanctions in place on Syria, but has ramped them up during the war alongside the EU, accusing the government of human rights violations, which it denies.

The European Network of Councils for the Judiciary's (ENCJ) announcement adds to widespread criticism of the nationalist government's changes to the courts since coming to power in late 2015.
The ENCJ's board said the Polish National Judiciary Council (KRS), which appoints judges and represents Poland at the ENCJ, ""is no longer an institution which is independent of the executive and ... guarantees the final responsibility for the support of the judiciary in the independent delivery of justice.""
The ENCJ, which advises the EU's executive on upholding the rule of law in the bloc, will convene its members on Sept. 17 to decide whether to suspend the KRS.
The EU has several legal cases open against Poland for its overhaul of the judiciary, but the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party says the changes are needed to clear out the legacy of communism and make the courts more effective.
The president of Poland's Supreme Court, Malgorzata Gersdorf, has defied a new law that forces her into early retirement and has called on the European Union to defend her country's judiciary from government interference.

Niger is a country of transit for migrants seeking to reach Europe by boat from Libya and Issoufou is an ally of the West in its fight against Islamist insurgents based in Mali and Nigeria.
On Wednesday, Issoufou said in a statement before talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel that his administration wanted more European assistance for Niger in the fields of security and development. 
""On Libya for example, I expressed my wish that the chancellor support us so that together we can quickly find a solution to get out of the crisis in Libya because as long as Libya remains in the current chaos, the stability and the security of the Sahel countries is at stake,"" he said.
He praised his country's efforts to fight smugglers who make fortunes from sending people on the perilous journey to Europe, saying that clandestine migration had dropped from 100,000 people a year in 2016 to 10,000 this year.
But he said the success could not last as long as Libya remained in chaos. 
The nation splintered following the 2011 NATO-backed revolt that toppled Muammar Gaddafi, and since 2014 has been divided between competing political and military groups based in Tripoli and the east.
Southern Niger, which borders Nigeria, has been the target of frequent deadly raids by Islamist Boko Haram militants.

EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Screaming, chanting, and torrents of religious-style vocals are the backdrop to Pussy Riot's Edinburgh Fringe show, which centers on the real-life trial and imprisonment of Russian frontwoman Maria Alyokhina.
A fierce critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Alyokhina, 30, retells the story of the group's 2012 protest performance in a Moscow cathedral and the two-year prison sentence she and another band-member received for it.
The group uses video footage and subtitles on two screens above the stage and rants at a delighted public, at one point spraying them with water and throwing bottles into the crowd.
The band's lyrics are sacrilegious and feminist, and make fun of Russian power in songs like ""Putin peed his pants"", with lyrics like ""The glorious Madonna will teach you how to fight/The feminist Magdalene went to a protest march"".
""Our country is not only these assholes at the Kremlin, but us as well,"" Alyokhina told Reuters before the show. 
""(We are about) freedom and truth: Maybe it sounds naive but ... you can get imprisoned because of a song or because of a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post, but it's not one or two cases, it's happening every week now.""
Her book ""Riot Days"", which she is also presenting this week at the Edinburgh International Book Festival, is part protest manual, part memoir. She aims to show what she says is the true face of Putin and to inspire others to say ""no"".
Pussy Riot's tour of the United Kingdom comes as relations with Russia are at a low after the poisoning of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia.
Britain has blamed Russia for the attack and, together with Western allies, expelled dozens of diplomats. Russia denies any involvement.
Alyokhina said the poisoning was no surprise, given that the security services are the major force in Russian politics. ""It's (the KGB Russian secret service) method. It's a method which was created 100 years ago, and it's still alive,"" she said.
To attend the Edinburgh festival Alyokhina defied an order that she stay in Russia, but she did not give details on how she did so. She said she would return to Russia, despite fraught dealings with the authorities, where she has an 11-year-old son.
Asked if she feared for her life, she said: ""No. Fear paralyses people. And if you want changes, you should overcome yourself."" 
Russia hosted the World Cup earlier this year, and what was largely seen as a successful championship was set off-kilter by a brief invasion of the pitch by Pussy Riot members during the final.
Alyokhina said she was not convinced of Putin's popularity in Russia, saying that he was aided by the repression of his opponents. In March, he secured a new six-year presidential term after more than 70 percent of voters backed him.
""In spite of the fact all the (television) channels belong to him, look what's happening in the street. Students, teenagers, people from completely different parts of society come out to protest in spite of the fact that they could find themselves behind bars at any moment for doing that,"" she said. 

""I believe that's the real Russia.""

1183,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 10:07AM ET</span>",Special Report: Children poisoned by lead on U.S. Army bases as hazards ignored,"By Joshua Schneyer and Andrea Januta
FORT BENNING, Georgia (Reuters) - Army Colonel J. Cale Brown put his life on the line in two tours of duty in Afghanistan, earning a pair of Bronze Stars for his service. In between those deployments, Brown received orders to report to Fort Benning, the sprawling Georgia base that proudly describes itself as the century-old home of the U.S. infantry.
He was pleased. His wife, Darlena, was pregnant with their second child, and the Browns owned a home in the area. Their 10-month-old son, John Cale Jr, was a precocious baby, babbling a dozen words and exploring solid foods.
Cale's duties as a battalion commander required him to live on base. So instead of moving into their own house, in 2011 the Browns rented a place inside Fort Benning. The 80-year-old white stucco home had hosted generations of officers.
Like most family housing on U.S. bases today, the home wasn't owned and operated by the military. It was managed by Villages of Benning, a partnership between two private companies and the U.S. Army, whose website beckons families to ""enjoy the luxuries of on-post living.""
The symptoms began suddenly. At 18 months, JC would awake screaming. He began refusing food, stopped responding to his name and lost most of his words.
""He was disappearing into an isolated brain,"" Darlena recalls.
For nearly a year, doctors probed: Was it colic? Autism? Ear infections? Then, in late 2012, came a call from JC's pediatrician: He had high levels of lead in his blood. When Darlena told Villages of Benning of his poisoning, contractors ordered home testing.
The results: At least 113 spots in the home had lead paint, including several peeling or crumbling patches, requiring $26,150 in lead abatement. Villages of Benning moved the Browns into another old house next door.
The heavy metal had stunted JC's brain, medical records reviewed by Reuters show. At age two, he was diagnosed with a developmental disorder caused by lead. Now eight, JC has undergone years of costly therapy. He excels at reading and swimming, but still struggles with speech, hyperactivity and social interactions.
When a reporter met JC last year, the boy looked away and repeated a phrase from a children's TV show: ""Max, what did you do? Max, what did you do?"" Later, JC sat outside and watched sunlight gliding through his fingers, seemingly lost in reverie.
""I'm sad that my son lost his future,"" Darlena said. ""It was because of where we were that this happened.""
This wasn't supposed to happen to families like the Browns, who move often between posts for the U.S. armed forces, trusting base landlords and military brass to provide safe shelter for children and spouses.
Cale Brown, a 46-year-old active-duty colonel, now works on detail to the White House on the National Security Council, helping to protect the country from complex threats like North Korea's nuclear program.
For years, he has told the Army of failures to defend children on U.S. bases from lead poisoning, a preventable household health hazard. Ingesting the heavy metal can severely affect mental and physical development, especially in children, causing brain damage and other potentially lifelong health impacts. But poisoning is avoidable if old homes containing lead paint are properly monitored and maintained.
""There is no acceptable number of children that the Army can allow to be so egregiously hurt,"" Cale wrote in a letter to the Army Office of the Inspector General last year, describing the poisoning of JC and hundreds of other military kids he was aware of. He hasn't received a response to the letter's concerns.
The Browns' story and others, told publicly for the first time here, reveal a toxic scourge inside homes on military bases. Previously undisclosed military and state health records, and testing by Reuters for lead in soldiers' homes, show problems at some of America's largest military installations.
Federal law defines lead-based paint as containing 0.5 percent or more lead by weight. Sales have been banned since 1978. But many older homes still contain lead paint, which is particularly dangerous when it peels, chips or turns to dust – easy for kids to swallow or breathe in.
Reuters tested five homes at Benning, using a methodology designed with a Columbia University geochemist. All five contained hazardous levels of deteriorating lead paint within reach of children, in one case exceeding the federal threshold by a factor of 58.
Testing turned up problems elsewhere as well. At West Point, New York, home of the United States Military Academy, paint chips falling from a family's front door contained lead at 19 times the federal threshold.
At Kentucky's Fort Knox, whose vaults hold much of America's gold reserves, Reuters found paint peeling from a covered porch where small kids play. It contained 50 percent lead by weight, or 100 times the threshold.
The Army requires http://www.campbell.army.mil/Installation/Environmental_Handbook/Documents/LBPManagementtPlan_DEC2014.pdf abatement when certified testing identifies deteriorating lead paint in base homes. Yet it also ""discourages"" this type of lead-paint inspection https://phc.amedd.army.mil/topics/workplacehealth/ih/Pages/Lead.aspx, in part because lead abatement can be costly.
These homes put military kids at risk. Reuters obtained medical data from the Army showing that at least 31 small children tested high for lead at a Fort Benning hospital over a recent six-year period. All tested above the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's threshold for elevated lead levels – 5 micrograms per deciliter of blood. Any child who tests high warrants a public health response, the CDC says.
Army data from other clinics showed at least 77 more high blood-lead tests for children at Fort Polk in Louisiana, Fort Riley in Kansas, and Fort Hood and Fort Bliss in Texas.
From 2011 to 2016, Brooke Army Medical Center in Texas – which processes blood tests from many bases nationwide – registered more than 1,050 small children who tested above the CDC's elevated threshold, the center's records show.
The thousand-plus blood results, obtained from Army bases through Freedom of Information Act requests, provide only a glimpse of the problem. A $10 finger-prick test can spot a child exposed to lead, yet millions of U.S. children are never screened. Just how many are tested across all military bases isn't clear. But for those who are, the results often go unreported to state public health agencies that attend to poisoned kids.
Reuters found that Fort Benning in Georgia was not reporting lead results for small children tested at the base's hospital. Nor was Brooke Army Medical Center in Texas. Georgia and Texas, like most states, require the reporting of all these lead testing results to state health authorities.
The Army declined to comment on the lead hazards Reuters detected at base homes. Asked about the broader findings of this article, a spokeswoman said the Army conducts yearly visits to ensure housing is safe and follows the recommendations of the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics when responding to children with high lead tests. Housing managers classify resident complaints about lead paint as ""urgent"" and seek to respond within hours, she said.
""We are committed to providing a safe and secure environment on all of our installations,"" Army spokeswoman Colonel Kathleen Turner said in a written statement, ""and to providing the highest quality of care to our service members, their families, and all those entrusted to our care.""
The two contractors that operate Villages of Benning – Clark Realty Capital and Michaels Management Services – didn't respond to requests for comment.
The military's lapses in lead safeguards leave legions of kids at risk. Private contractors house some 700,000 Americans at more than 100 military installations nationwide, including an estimated 100,000 children ages 0 through 5.
Benning alone is home to some 2,000 small children. Of its 4,001 family homes, 2,274 ""have lead-based paint present in them,"" according to a Villages of Benning memo from November 2017. The mere presence of lead paint doesn't make a home dangerous, but when the paint deteriorates, it is a ""hazard and needs immediate attention,"" the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says.
""These are families making sacrifices by serving,"" said Dr. Bruce Lanphear, a toxicity researcher at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia who reviewed Reuters' findings. ""It appears that lead poisoning is sometimes the cost of their loyalty to the military.""
Reuters began examining lead poisoning at U.S. bases last year, and in April began seeking interviews with Army officials. The Army declined to talk at the time.
After Reuters informed the Army and families that reporters had found hazards on bases, Fort Benning's garrison commander, Colonel Clinton W. Cox, wrote to residents that ""unknown persons"" were seeking to test homes for lead and advised them not to cooperate. In a June 30 ""Resident Safety Alert,"" Cox told families to call 911 or base security to report such ""suspicious behavior.""
Cox said he was unaware of who had done lead testing in base homes when he sent the letter. ""What we're most concerned about is our residents' security,"" he said in a brief phone interview.
But behind the scenes, the Army also began quietly addressing some of the problems.
After reporters asked why it often wasn't informing state health departments about poisoned children, the Army overhauled its practices to comply with state laws. When Reuters found unsafe conditions at Fort Knox, contractors announced a neighborhood-wide lead abatement program. After reporters found the neurotoxin in a child's bedroom at Benning, base command approved the family's move to another home.
A HISTORY OF NEGLECT
For most military families, living on base is an option, not a requirement, though it can be enticing. The gated enclaves are considered safe havens that build esprit de corps. They offer support for spouses of deployed troops, access to military schools, lodging for low-income families. About 30 percent of service families live on bases.
By the 1990s, the U.S. stock of military family housing – nearly 300,000 homes in all service branches – was decaying and starved of funding. ""Continuing to neglect these issues runs the risk of collapsing the force,"" the Department of Defense warned in a 1996 briefing document presented to a congressional sub-committee.
The same year, the military began privatizing its homes. The initiative was the largest-ever corporate takeover of federal housing. It was meant to rid bases of substandard accommodations and save taxpayers billions by having contractors foot the rebuilding bill. In return, contractors would enjoy a steady flow of rental income over 50-year leases.
The military knew hazards lurked in its housing. In 2005, the Army released an environmental study that said 75 percent of its 90,000 homes nationwide didn't meet its own standards of quality or safety. Of Benning, it said: ""As homes deteriorate, the risk of children's being exposed to hazardous materials … would increase.""
Twenty years after privatization began, in 2016, a DOD Inspector General report found that poor maintenance and oversight left service families vulnerable to ""pervasive"" health and safety hazards.
An increase in Pentagon housing funds – $133 million – was earmarked this fiscal year, largely for overseas bases, where the military still owns its housing. Meanwhile, in recent years the Defense Department has reduced the housing subsidies that fund upkeep of privatized homes on U.S. bases, leading to fewer maintenance staff, the Army has noted http://www.rci.army.mil/programinformation/docs/BAH%20Analysis%20-%20Impact%20to%20RCI.pdf.
The age and condition of base homes vary, and lead hazards are hardly exclusive to military housing. A two-year Reuters investigation https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-lead-newyork identified more than 3,800 neighborhoods nationwide – mostly in civilian settings – with alarming levels of poisoning.
Military families can face special difficulties if they complain about hazards in their homes, however. They are taking on landlords who are in business with their employer. Among the 60 interviewed for this story, more than half expressed fear that being identified could hurt a military member's career.
But in private, some trade stories about unsafe homes. Darlena Brown helped create a private Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) group with nearly 700 members. Many have shared photos of peeling paint, mold or other toxins at home and tales of unresponsive base landlords.
Reuters devised a plan to test for hazards in the homes and yards of some of these concerned families. Working with Columbia University scientists, reporters provided home lead testing to 11 families on seven bases. Eight homes had blatant hazards in children's play areas – visibly peeling patches of lead-based paint.
Deteriorating paint from these houses – in Georgia, Texas, New York and Kentucky – had ""very high"" or ""extremely high"" lead content that puts children at immediate risk, said Alexander van Geen, a research professor of geochemistry who oversaw the lab analysis at Columbia's Lamont Earth Observatory.
The true number of children exposed on bases is hidden by factors including the military's spotty blood-testing and lapses in reporting to civilian authorities.
To prevent further exposure, most state health departments track lead-poisoned children and mandate inspections in their homes.
Yet when Georgia health officials repeatedly sought test results from Benning, the base refused to share them, alluding to exemptions for federal facilities, state email records show. No such exemptions exist.
""They do not report to us,"" the head of Georgia's lead-poisoning prevention program, Christy Kuriatnyk, vented about Fort Benning in an internal email to colleagues last year. ""I've tried to get them to voluntarily report but that went nowhere.""
In April, Reuters presented the Army with evidence of its reporting lapses. In late July, the Army said it had ""instituted new procedures to ensure that all reporting requirements are properly observed"" nationwide.
'NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT'
At Benning, private contractors took over the base's family housing in 2006. They pledged to demolish thousands of dilapidated homes and build almost 3,200 new ones within 10 years. Estimated cost: $602 million. At the time, 99 percent of Benning homes predated the 1978 U.S. ban on lead paint.
The contractors were also required to maintain nearly 500 historic Benning homes, and agreed to control lead, asbestos, mold, basement flooding and other risks.
In 2011, a Villages of Benning agent took the Browns on a home walk-through before they moved in. Darlena expressed concern about lead paint.
""You have nothing to worry about, Mrs. Brown,"" she recalled being told. ""We've never had any problem with lead.""
The same year, Benning Martin Army Community Hospital recorded seven high lead results for small children, hospital records show. The hospital says it doesn't know whether children tested there lived on or off base.
After moving in, Darlena asked maintenance to fix paint chipping around windows, but was told by a supervisor that the crew couldn't work on historic windows, she said.
In 2012, JC and as many as five other children had high lead tests at Benning's hospital.
After JC was poisoned, Cale Brown pleaded with base leaders to enforce regular home inspections, test more kids and scrutinize contractors. ""A few small changes could mean the difference between a child having life-altering developmental problems or being completely healthy,"" he wrote Benning's garrison command in December 2012.
""Bottom line, we will do everything necessary to make sure this is addressed thoroughly and quickly,"" Colonel Jeffrey Fletcher, the garrison commander at the time, responded in an email. Fletcher declined to comment.
The next year, 2013, Benning's hospital recorded seven more high lead-test results for children. One child had lead levels more than double JC's, hospital records show.
Villages of Benning began replacing some old leaded windows and garage doors around the base that year, but left others in place, state and Army records show.
STALKED BY LEAD, GOING TO COURT
Even after the Browns moved to another Benning home, JC wasn't safe.
In 2013, he began special education preschool classes at Benning's Dexter Elementary School. Months later, Darlena received a frightening note on Defense Department letterhead: Drinking water taps in JC's classroom had tested high for lead.
One had 2,200 parts per billion lead – 147 times an EPA safety threshold and higher than all but a few of the worst taps found during the recent water crisis in Flint, Michigan. It isn't clear how many students may have been exposed. Benning didn't require or recommend they get screened.
The Army said the contamination was limited to individual taps around the base and didn't affect the underlying water system. The tainted taps were shut, and parents who wanted testing for their children were given the option, the Army said.
In 2014, the Browns filed suit in Georgia federal court against Benning's housing contractors, alleging their negligence caused JC's poisoning and seeking compensation for his disability. The contractors denied any wrongdoing and contested the suit.
Cale deployed to Afghanistan the same year. There, he pushed for housing repairs at U.S. bases in a meeting that November with Katherine Hammack, the Army's top official in charge of military installations.
She seemed to favor bold action, Cale said: preventing small children from living in older base homes altogether. Cale said his follow-ups went unanswered.
Hammack, who left the Army last year, told Reuters she explored such a plan, but Army lawyers said it could be discriminatory against families with children. ""It is up to the soldier to make a choice,"" she said.
Families who rent pre-1978 housing on bases are given lead disclosure forms before signing a lease, as required of all U.S. landlords by federal law, and can opt to live elsewhere, the Army said.
Two days before Christmas 2014, Darlena learned that JC's lead levels, which had declined over time, were rising again. Her younger son's levels were up, too, though below the CDC's elevated threshold. The agency says there is no safe level of lead in children's blood.
She removed the boys from their second Benning home that night. Nine time zones away, Cale boarded a chopper out of Forward Operating Base Gamberi in eastern Afghanistan. He was granted emergency home leave to help his family resettle.
The next year, in 2015, the Defense Department's Inspector General found that a Clark and Michaels partnership had failed to correct lead paint hazards in homes at Fort Belvoir in Virginia. The Army pledged to address the issue with contractors, IG records show.
At Benning, meanwhile, children had 14 more high lead tests.
DANGER ON RAINBOW AVENUE
Fort Benning's Rainbow Avenue seems a perfect spot for families, the yards of its 1920s homes filled with toys, American flags fluttering from front porches.
Behind this idyll, children face poisoning risks.
Since 2015, state lead inspectors have visited at least three of the 33 houses on the street in response to calls from worried residents, state environmental records show. ""The homes all have high levels of lead,"" inspectors wrote in an internal memo last year.
In one Rainbow home, they found leaded dust at 93 times the EPA's hazard level.
In another, inspector William Spain of the state Environmental Protection Department visited a mother of three in 2016. He found paint chips throughout the home and later emailed colleagues: ""Her youngest will be 5 in July and did not appear normal.""
The mother had grown concerned after the mysterious deaths of family pets. But she hesitated when the state offered additional help, pleading with Spain not to conduct lead testing in the home or to speak with neighbors.
Spain, who has since retired, said in an interview that Benning families expressed concern that notifying outsiders might anger commanders and harm careers.
""Something became obvious to me as I worked there,"" he said. ""You and your family cannot make trouble for base command.""
State environmental records show that Jana Martin, another mother on the block, had a four-year-old son who suffered for months from severe vomiting and belly pain – common symptoms of lead exposure. She and the doctors were mystified. ""I couldn't even get a job because my kid was so sick,"" Martin said. She had put in two maintenance requests to fix chipping paint, but Villages of Benning didn't respond for months, Martin said.
When Martin's husband met Cale Brown, the colonel urged the family to act. The Martins bought testing swabs online. They lit up bright red, indicating exposed lead paint.
Finally, in October 2016, housing managers moved the Martins out temporarily and replaced their windows. State inspectors only learned about the case when Martin called seeking assistance.
By the time Rainbow resident Dana Sackett left a voicemail on a state lead hotline last year, inspectors knew the street well.
""Another Rainbow row site at Ft. Benning,"" one wrote.
Sackett, a mother of two, is a PhD toxicologist. Her husband is a lawyer with the Army Rangers. After moving to the street, she spotted paint hazards and complained.
Villages of Benning initially declined to fix them, state files say. Then mold spread in an upstairs closet, and repairs for that problem went ahead while Sackett and her girls temporarily relocated. She demanded the workers address paint hazards, too.
The landlords hired workers to scrape lead paint off the home. They lacked the required safety certifications and protective gear to conduct lead abatement, Army records show.
The Army says it has since taken steps to ensure all Benning workers dealing with lead paint are properly certified.
Last fall, Villages of Benning told Sackett the work was done and her family could move back. She found paint scrapings and dust, the records show, and refused to return unless housing managers could show the home wouldn't poison her girls.
Days later, Villages of Benning declared the property a ""contamination area"" and had Sackett sign papers promising not to enter. ""It was one of the most stressful things I've been through,"" she said.
Six months later, 103 Rainbow Avenue stood vacant. At another Rainbow Avenue home, paint was peeling from doors and a window by a child's bed. A bathroom faucet leaked brown goop. A pizza-sized black mold bloom covered a ceiling. Outside, old paint crumbled from window frames, steps and a garage.
Lab testing at Columbia showed four of six paint samples from the home exceeded lead safety standards, including one from beside the child's bed. The family reported the findings to Benning officials and is now moving.
'SILENCED VERSION'
About a mile from Rainbow Avenue lies Perkins Village, a cluster of drab mid-century homes that isn't supposed to exist.
Benning's development plans called for all 180 Perkins houses to be razed years ago and replaced with 228 new Mission-style homes. Just a handful of the old homes were torn down, and none of the new ones have been built. Reuters tested two homes in Perkins Village. Both had visibly deteriorating paint with lead above federal safety standards.
The Benning contractors wound up building just over half of the 3,185 new homes that were promised back when the housing was privatized. As a result, records show, nearly three out of five Benning homes still contain lead.
The Army said it's satisfied with the results of the building project. It said it doesn't know whether any children living in Benning's older homes have tested high for lead in recent years. The base's data system can't track where children with elevated lead levels were living when they were tested.
Darlena Brown said Villages of Benning wasn't aware of JC's poisoning, either, until she spoke up.
Court records show the Browns' lawsuit was settled earlier this year. As a precondition of settlement talks, the Benning contractors demanded the Browns stop communicating with Reuters and stop mentioning the dispute publicly.
This January, on the private Facebook page where military families share their worries, Darlena Brown revised an earlier post. It still recounts her son's poisoning but omits any mention of the landlords.
She changed the title, too. It's now called ""Darlena's Story (The silenced version).""

Peter Fisher, 67, was riding through the High Holborn area on Wednesday morning when the collision occurred. Police said he had died at the scene. 
""We are all deeply shocked and saddened to learn that Dr Peter Fisher tragically died in a road traffic accident yesterday,"" Gill Gaskin, medical director at University College London Hospitals (UCLH), said in a statement on Thursday.
""Peter was director of research at UCLH’s Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine (RLHIM), and physician to Her Majesty The Queen.""
Buckingham Palace said the queen had been informed of his death.
The London Evening Standard newspaper said Fisher was a world expert in homeopathy and had worked as homeopathic physician to the British monarch for about 15 years. 
""He was much respected as a good doctor who saw homeopathy as complementary to medical care. We are all shocked by his tragic loss,"" Marcus Setchell, the queen's former surgeon-gynaecologist, told the Standard.

1185,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 09:50AM ET</span>",Special Report: Reuters' testing triggers lead cleanup at Fort Knox base,"By Joshua Schneyer
FORT KNOX, Kentucky (Reuters) - Fort Knox is famed for its ultra-secure bullion depository that holds $100 billion in U.S. gold reserves. But some families at the Kentucky Army base have concerns about another heavy metal: lead.
When Reuters offered lead testing to military families at several bases, the highest result came from a peeling paint sample one Knox family collected from their covered back porch. It contained 50 percent lead, or 100 times the federal hazard level.
In April, a reporter visited the home, where Karla Hughes lives with her husband, an Army captain, and 4-year-old daughter, who doesn't have elevated lead levels. In a grassy area where children play nearby, paint chipping from an abandoned electric switch house contained 16 percent lead.
Several historic homes on the Hughes' street had old paint peeling from exterior trim, porch or window areas.
Knox Hills, the landlord for more than 2,300 homes on base, removed exterior lead paint from many older homes in recent years, but left others untouched.
When Hughes complained about paint conditions in April, the company sent a maintenance worker, who repainted a porch beam but conducted no testing.
Later, Hughes pointed out the copious black paint peeling from a porch handrail to a housing supervisor from Knox Hills. ""That's not lead paint,"" she said he assured her. Knox Hills declined to comment on the episode.
A reporter was a block away, and later watched as Hughes collected paint falling from the handrail. Lab testing showed its lead content was 28 times a federal threshold that would require abatement.
In response, Knox Hills announced a neighborhood-wide lead paint abatement project focused on porch banisters, several home exteriors and the old switch-house. Residents said the project involves around 40 homes; it included ""complete removal of paint and repainting"" of the porch handrails.
Without Reuters' testing data, Hughes said, ""this danger may have been left undiscovered and ignored.""
""Knox Hills is taking the proper steps,"" said Army spokeswoman Colonel Kathleen Turner. No child living on base has tested high for lead in years, she said.
Knox Hills is a partnership between the Army and private contractors including Lendlease, a property developer headquartered in Sydney, Australia, that operates military housing at several U.S. bases.
""Our response to these concerns, as in all resident issues, are our highest priority,"" said Lendlease spokeswoman Meryl Exley.

The arrest comes after German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas urged Ankara on Monday to do more to improve its troubled diplomatic ties with both Germany and the United States which would also help to ease its current economic woes.
""We're aware of the case. The embassy in Ankara will initiate consular assistance,"" the foreign ministry source said.
A German foreign ministry spokesman said on Wednesday there were currently seven other German citizens arrested in Turkey on political grounds. Turkey has also arrested several U.S. citizens in recent months.
In the latest case, ARD public broadcaster reported that Turkish police arrested 46-year old Ilhami A. on Tuesday morning while he was visiting his mother in her home town Saribasak in a largely Kurdish region of eastern Turkey.
A judge in the provincial capital Elazig issued an arrest warrant against Ilhami A., who has Kurdish roots and works as a taxi driver in the northern German city of Hamburg, ARD reported. He has lived in Germany since 1992, it said.
His Turkish lawyer, Ercan Yildirim, told ARD his client had been accused of ""terror propaganda"" because he had criticized the Turkish government on social media. 
Yildrim told ARD his client had been taken to the prison of Elazig and that he would file a complaint against the arrest on Thursday.

YANGON (Reuters) - The wife of imprisoned Reuters journalist Wa Lone, who is facing up to 14 years in jail in Myanmar for allegedly violating the colonial-era Official Secrets Act, gave birth to a girl on Friday.
Wa Lone, 32, and his colleague Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, have been detained since December accused of obtaining secret state documents in a case widely seen as a test of press freedom in the Southeast Asian nation.
Wa Lone's wife, Pan Ei Mon, gave birth in a Yangon hospital early on Friday to a girl, named Thet Htar Angel. She is the couple's first child.
""I've wished Wa Lone could be free since before I knew I was pregnant, and now I want him to be free even more,"" Pan Ei Mon, 35, said as she cradled the baby.
Wa Lone has been detained for most of the time his wife was pregnant.
A Reuters Special Report published on Wednesday traced the lives of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who were arrested while reporting on the massacre of 10 Muslim men in Myanmar last year. [nL4N1UZ2MM]
The killings took place during an army crackdown that United Nations agencies say prompted about 700,000 people to flee to Bangladesh.
The Myanmar court hearing the case against Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo is due to hear final arguments on Aug 20 and the judge, Ye Lwin, will issue a verdict in the following weeks.
The journalists have pleaded not guilty to the charges and have told the court how they were entrapped by police officials who planted documents on them.
Stephen J. Adler, president and editor-in-chief at Reuters, congratulated the couple on the birth of their daughter.
""While this should be a moment of great joy for them, it is sad and troubling that Wa Lone has missed being present at the birth of his daughter as he continues to be incarcerated on baseless charges.

""We will continue to do all we can to support them during this difficult separation and we remain hopeful that both Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo will be released soon and reunited with their families.""

He was 93.
A poet-politician, Vajpayee was one of the most popular leaders of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
But unlike Modi, who critics say is a polarizing figure despite his pledge of inclusive development for India's 1.3 billion people, Vajpayee was the moderate face of Hindu nationalism, admired even by prominent political foes.
Vajpayee served as prime minister briefly in 1996 then again from 1998 to 2004.
""Former PM, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was loved and respected by millions. My condolences to his family & all his admirers. We will miss him,"" Rahul Gandhi, president of the opposition Congress party, tweeted. 
Vajpayee was one of the few leaders of the BJP to express anguish when hundreds of Muslims were killed rioting in 2002 in the western state of Gujarat, which Modi governed.
Vajpayee called the 1992 destruction of a 16th-century mosque on a disputed site by Hindu fanatics India's darkest hour. 
However, he also defended a Hindu campaign for construction of a temple on the disputed site, which Hindus believe was the birthplace of god-king Rama.
Modi said Vajpayee's stewardship had put India on a fast track to growth. 
""It was Atal Ji's exemplary leadership that set the foundations for a strong, prosperous and inclusive India in the 21st century,"" Modi said in a tweet.
Vajpayee suffered a stroke in 2009 and retreated from public view. Leaders of the BJP were gathering at his home in New Delhi to pay their respects. 
As premier, Vajpayee was not afraid to take risks. He gave the go-ahead for underground nuclear tests in 1998 believing nuclear weapons would be deterrent against China and Pakistan. 
Pakistan responded to those tests with six of its own, forever altering South Asian security, launching both countries on a race to amass the weapons.

But a year later, Vajpayee rode on the first bus to begin a new service from Delhi to the Pakistani city of Lahore in a rare trip by an Indian premier to mend ties with the neighbor.

Tanzanian opposition leaders have complained that tolerance for dissent has diminished rapidly since President John Magufuli took office in 2015 on pledges to reform the East African nation's economy and crack down on corruption.
The U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam cited ""credible"" accounts of violence and irregularities ahead of the by-elections.
In a statement published on its website on Wednesday, the embassy said the National Election Commission had refused to register opposition candidates and that they had been subject to police intimidation.
The embassy also cited unwarranted arrests of candidates and acts to suppress freedom of assembly and speech.
""Such actions undermine the rights that Tanzania’s constitution guarantees its citizens and jeopardize peace, stability, and security in the country and throughout the region,"" the embassy said.
Magufuli's government has introduced anti-corruption measures and tightened regulations on foreign companies, particularly in the mining sector.[L8N1M621N]
The vote in question involved a parliamentary by-election in the northwestern region of Kigoma and 36 local races, according to The Citizen, an English-language Tanzanian daily.
The paper reported that the electoral commission assessed the polls to be free and fair. The commission had asked the U.S. Embassy to provide evidence for its allegations, it said, citing NEC Information Officer Christina Njovu.

Explaining his decision, Andrzej Duda said the rules -- approved by parliament in July -- effectively meant that parties would need as much as 16.5 percent of the vote to win any seats in the European legislature. 
""That's moving too far away from the standards of proportional representation,"" he said.
A strong performance by eurosceptic parties across the EU in the election could have a significant impact on future policy-making in the bloc, which will have 27 members after Britain leaves next March. 
Nearly three years since winning a parliamentary vote in 2015, PiS which combines nationalist rhetoric with generous welfare policies, enjoys robust public support in Poland.
For Duda, the support of smaller parties, particularly the anti-establishment Kukiz-15, may be crucial for his re-election prospects in 2020. 

An ally of PiS, he has had a rocky relationship with its government and may need broader support to beat his likely rival Donald Tusk, a former Polish prime minister who is now President of the European Council.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The German military needs dozens of new light helicopters to cover shortfalls in flight hours for pilot training and carry out other missions, a new study completed by the German army found, according to sources familiar with the document.
The report, which has not been publicly released, concluded that the various military services needed about 70 to 80 new light helicopters, according to the sources, but no decisions about a procurement program have been made. 
German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen hinted at potential new orders of light helicopters during a visit to a helicopter air base last month, but gave no details.
The study could eventually lead to dozens of new orders for the H145M light utility helicopter built by European aircraft maker Airbus, which has already supplied 15 of the helicopters to German special forces, the sources said.
The helicopters already delivered were performing well, and had been delivered on cost and on time, they said, noting that the U.S. military operates more than 400 of an earlier model. 
A ministry spokesman confirmed completion of the internal study and said it would be used for further planning, but declined to provide any details.
""This is an internal planning document that provides a good basis for further analysis and discussions,"" the spokesman said.
Airbus had no comment on the internal army report.
A company spokesman said the H145M military helicopter, derived from the Airbus H145 commercial workhorse used by police and emergency medical services, had also been ordered or was being operated by Serbia, Thailand, Hungary and Luxembourg.
""Mission readiness of the German air force's H145M is above 99 percent, the fleet has accumulated more than 8,000 flight hours since the delivery of first aircraft in 2015,"" the Airbus spokesman said.
Hans-Peter Bartels, the military ombudsman for the German parliament, has repeatedly called attention to the urgent need for more helicopters to cover shortfalls in flight hours for pilots across the German military, or Bundeswehr.

TORONTO/OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Muslims traveling to the Hajj pilgrimage face delays coming back due to a diplomatic dispute with Saudi Arabia that is also prompting thousands of students from the kingdom to scramble to sell their assets and return home to meet a month-end deadline.
As the stalemate continues, Canada is reaching out to its allies, including the United States and European Union, to rally support, and talking to Saudi Arabia to resolve the dispute.
Riyadh abruptly severed diplomatic and trade ties earlier this month in response to Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland's tweet demanding the release of civil society activists in the kingdom. Riyadh also ended state-backed educational and medical programs in Canada, resulting Saudi students here hustling to return home.
In Halifax, the Ummah Masjid organized yard sales to help students sell their furniture, electronics and even cars.
""Some of them, they only come one week ago and they are prepared to leave,"" said Abdallah Yousri, the mosque's imam. ""Some of them, they were in Saudi Arabia for summer vacation, and they just came to sell their products and then [leave].""
As of the end of June, there were more than 5,100 Saudi students with valid study permits for post-secondary institutions in Canada.
Many Canadian Muslims had booked flights with Saudia, the Kingdom's official airline, to perform the Hajj pilgrimages in the Saudi city of Mecca, which takes place from August 19 to 24 this year.
While Saudia trips to Mecca before August 13 were not affected, returns home prove to be a concern for many.
""We're nervous as a family because we don't want her to be stranded in an airport,"" Jawad Chaudhry, a real estate broker in Hamilton, said of his mother, who is traveling via Saudia for Hajj.
SILENT ALLIES
Freeland has spoken with officials of the European Union, Germany, Sweden and the United Arab Emirates in an effort to find support, a spokesman for the foreign minister told Reuters.
""We have a dialogue that is continuing with the Saudis, that's encouraging, we know that we need to maintain an open dialogue with them to resolve this issue,"" he added.
But silence from Canada's traditional backers has sparked some soul-searching in Ottawa.
The big issue is the future of foreign relationships in a world where Canada can no longer count on support from its major allies, said Roland Paris, a former foreign affairs adviser to Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
""We're getting a glimpse of what the world looks like when the United States isn't a strong advocate of human rights, one in which liberal democracies are keeping their heads down,"" Paris said.
The U.S. State Department last week urged Canada and Saudi Arabia to use diplomacy to resolve their dispute, which did not come up during a phone call between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Monday. [L1N1UY1I1]
Bob Rae, former leader of the federal Liberal party, said Canada has to be more strategic about how to push its human rights agenda. 

""There needs to be a clearer sense of strategy about why we are intervening in some situations and not in others, and how one would ever expect countries to take criticism without responding,"" Rae told Reuters.

Librarian Jacob Meir Abdellak, who lives in east London, made the call eight minutes before his 5.47 a.m. Norwegian Air flight from Gatwick Airport was due to leave on May 11 because he was significantly late and airline staff had refused to allow him on board, a court heard.
His hoax meant passengers had to be re-screened and take-off was delayed by 90 minutes. An investigation by Gatwick revealed that the hoax call had been made using the same number linked to his booking.
When Abdellak returned to the airport to take another flight to the United States on May 22, he was arrested. 
He initially claimed he had lost his phone's SIM card but on Tuesday pleaded guilty at Lewes Crown Court to communicating false information regarding a noxious substance likely to create serious risk to human health. He was sentenced to 10 months in prison.
""This was a quite ridiculous decision made by Abdellak, who fabricated an extremely serious allegation purely for his own benefit,"" said Gatwick Police Chief Inspector Marc Clothier on Thursday.

LONDON (Reuters) - Celebrities and influencers who endorse products without labeling their social media posts as paid-for by brands were warned on Thursday that they were breaking the rules as Britain's regulator launched an investigation into the trend. 
Recommendation from celebrities and social media influencers who have millions of followers is a growing marketing strategy for brands, but the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said that such endorsements could mislead customers.
It said it had seen posts that appeared to promote items or offer a celebrity's personal endorsement of a product, without it being clear whether the post had been paid for by the brand in question. 
""If people see clothes, cosmetics, a car, or a holiday being plugged by someone they admire, they might be swayed into buying it,"" said George Lusty, the CMA’s Senior Director for Consumer Protection.
""So it's really important they are clearly told whether a celebrity is promoting a product because they have bought it themselves, or because they have been paid or thanked in some way by the brand."" 
The CMA said it had written to a range of famous people to gather more information about their business agreements with brands, and also wanted the public to share their experiences as part of the investigation.
Consumer giants such as  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP),  Unilever  (L:ULVR), Nestle (S:NESN) and Mars have all spent money on so-called influencers to promote products. 
Brands will pay anywhere from $10,000 to more than $100,000 for a single social media post, depending on the size, engagement and loyalty of the person's followers, and Unilever said it accounted for ""tens of millions"" of its 7.7 billion euro marketing last year.
The most famous can earn even more. Reality TV stars Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian, singer Selena Gomez and Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo are the top-paid celebrities per post on Instagram, earning up to 1 million dollars a post, according to social media analytics firm HopperHQ.

Their posts are often tagged ""paid partnership with"", ""#sponsored"" or ""#ad"" to indicate that the stars have been paid by the brands in question.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Bahrain's detention of activist Nabeel Rajab is unlawful and violates his right to freedom of expression, U.N. human rights experts have found, calling on the kingdom to release him immediately with compensation.
There was no immediate reaction from Bahraini authorities to the appeal by the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, which said the government had not responded to its requests for information on the high-profile case.
Bahrain, where a Sunni Muslim royal family rules over a Shi'ite-majority population, has cracked down on perceived threats since Arab Spring protests in 2011, led mainly by Shi'ites, were quashed with the help of Gulf Arab neighbors.
Rajab was sentenced to five years in prison in February for criticising Saudi Arabia's air strikes in Yemen and writing tweets accusing Bahrain's prison authorities of torture.
A leading figure in the pro-democracy protests, he was already serving a two-year term over a news interview in which he said Bahrain tortured political prisoners.
In a formal opinion posted overnight, the U.N. panel of five independent experts said that provisions of Bahrain's penal code were ""so vague and overly broad"" that people were punished for merely exercising their rights under international law.
""The Working Group therefore considers that Mr. Rajab’s deprivation of liberty is arbitrary,"" it said, adding that: ""no such trial"" should have taken place.
It considered that Rajab's political views were ""clearly at the center of the present case and that the authorities have
displayed an attitude towards him that can only be characterized as discriminatory; indeed, he has been the target of persecution, including deprivation of liberty, for many years and there is no other explanation for this except that he is exercising his right to express such views and convictions.""
Rajab, held since June 2016, should be released immediately and compensated, it said.
The opinions of the panel are based on national obligations under international human rights law that they have ratified and are thus legally-binding in nature, it says.
Separately, the U.N. Human Rights Committee called last month for Bahrain to release activists including Rajab.
The United States, which has a major naval base in the country, has expressed concern about his case.
Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei of the London-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, said in a statement: ""The U.N. has now unequivocally found that Bahrain is arbitrarily detaining Nabeel Rajab in violation of numerous international legal standards – these vital findings cannot be ignored"". 

He called for Bahrain's allies, including Britain, to back the call for his release, adding: ""Anything short of that is a tacit endorsement Bahrain’s patently criminal behavior.""

1198,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 06:51AM ET</span>","If rupee slump persists, it can hurt India's Modi","By Manoj Kumar, Suvashree Choudhury and Neha Dasgupta
NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - The rupee's plunge to a record low has worried a wide cross-section of India's society: companies, importers, those going on vacation and students planning to study overseas. But if the weakness persists, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's job could become a lot harder just before big state and national elections.
India is a big buyer of everything from crude oil and electronics to gold and edible oil, and its import bill was expected to cross $600 billion in the fiscal year ending in March 2019, from about $565 billion in the previous year.
The 9.3 percent fall in the rupee  this year has already led to a surge in local prices of goods with an imported component. July was the ninth straight month in which India's inflation was higher than the central bank's medium-term target of 4 percent.
The currency fell to a fresh low of 70.40 to the dollar on Thursday.
""The sharp rupee depreciation has come as a shock for us,"" said Kamal Singh, 50, a senior government official in Delhi visiting family in the United States. ""Now I will have to spend at least 10,000 rupees ($143) more on travel.""
Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) considers urban middle-class Indians a key voting bloc, the segment most affected by the rupee depreciation. The opposition Congress party has blamed the government's policies for the rupee slump and called it an indication of weakness in the economy.
Most political analysts agree that Modi does not yet face a significant challenge, but believe he will be hard put to repeat the BJP's sweep of the 2014 general election.
Besides the next general election due by May, three big BJP-ruled states in India's heavily populated northern plains go to the polls over the next four months.
Satish Misra, senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi, said although the rupee slide was a result of several factors, it was affecting the image of the Modi government.
""As prices shoot up and products become costlier, the middle class will begin to get angry,"" Misra told Reuters. ""Since the middle class is the opinion maker, the BJP will suffer electorally.""
The government has said the depreciation is due to the economic woes in Turkey that has dragged down currencies of emerging market countries around the world.
""Recent developments relating to Turkey have generated global risk aversion towards emerging market currencies and the strengthening of the dollar,"" said senior cabinet minister Arun Jaitley.
""However, India's macro fundamentals remain resilient and strong. Developments are being monitored closely to address any situation that may arise in the context of the unsettled international environment.""
The rupee fall, however, benefits exporters such as software companies.
The Thomson Reuters India IT Services & Consulting share index, which includes top Indian firms such as  Infosys  (NS:INFY),  Tata Consultancy Services  (NS:TCS), Wipro (NS:WIPR) and  HCL Technologies  Ltd (NS:HCLT), has risen about 31 percent this year.
CORPORATE HIT
Indian companies which have raised funds overseas are worried about the rise in servicing costs. The country's external debt rose to $530 billion at the end of March, out of which nearly 42 percent constituted debt maturing by March 31.
Several companies have said the rupee's slide will hit their margins.
New Delhi-based Jindal Stainless (Hisar) Ltd (NS:JINA) said that as it is a net importer of raw materials, the sharp rupee depreciation would badly hurt the company, which has been lobbying to reduce an import tariff on steel scrap.
""With the depreciating currency, this problem gets further aggravated,"" Managing Director Abhyuday Jindal told Reuters. 
Other companies such as JSW Steels Ltd (NS:JSTL) and the GVK Group - which has business interests in energy, resources, airports, transportation and hospitality - are also bracing for higher input costs, which if not passed on to customers, would hit profitability.
""Inherently if you look at it, inflation is at a rate of 4.5 percent per year, so we cannot expect the rupee to be stable,"" said Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director of JSW, which is a heavy importer of high-quality coal.
""Everybody is expecting (some) rupee depreciation, but it's (happening) too fast.""
To temper the inflation and arrest the rupee slide, the Reserve Bank of India has raised interest rates by a total of 50 basis points in two consecutive policy meetings since April, the latest one on Aug. 1. It has also spent around $23 billion selling dollars since April. 
If the rupee stays around current levels, the government might have to consider cutting taxes on petroleum products to soothe customer anger at higher pump prices, said a finance ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
N.R. Bhanumurthy, an economist at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy think-tank, partly funded by the finance ministry, said a further rate hike was likely, which would take a toll on growth.

The government had forecast the economy would grow by 7.5 percent this fiscal year, one of the biggest expansions by a major economy in the world, after a 6.7 percent rise a year earlier.

Najib's government secured a simple majority in April to pass the Anti-Fake News 2018 bill, which set out fines of up to 500,000 ringgit ($123,000) and jail of up to six years.
Critics denounced the law as repressive and accused Najib of trying to curb free speech ahead of a May general election as his government tried to fend off criticism over accusations of graft and mismanagement.
Najib lost the election to an opposition alliance led by former premier Mahathir Mohamad, who had promised to scrap the law.
Parliament debated a motion to repeal the law for about three hours before passing it by a simple voice vote.
Rights groups welcomed the move.
""This is a law that was clearly designed to silence criticism of the authorities and to quell public debate – it should never have been allowed to pass in the first place,"" Teddy Baguilat, a board member of ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights, said in a statement.
Co-opted by U.S. President Donald Trump, the term ""fake news"" has become part of the standard repertoire of leaders in authoritarian countries to describe media reports and organizations critical of them.
Malaysia was among the first few countries to introduce an anti-fake news law although other countries in the region, including Singapore and the Philippines, have said they are considering how to tackle ""fake news"". 
Germany approved a plan last year to fine social media networks if they fail to remove hateful postings.
Mahathir was himself accused of fake news after authorities said they were investigating him over what they said were false claims that his plane was sabotaged ahead of the election.
Other leaders who were opposed to Najib were also charged under the act.

GAZA (Reuters) - Schools teaching half a million Palestinian refugees will reopen across the Middle East as planned later this month, a U.N. agency said on Thursday, despite funding cuts by its biggest donor the United States.
The opening of the schools on Aug. 29 had been in doubt after the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said it lacked funds to pay the 22,000 teachers in its educational network in the Gaza Strip, the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, and Jordan and Syria.
UNRWA said students will return to its 711 schools on time though it still did not have enough money to fund them for a full school year.
U.N. officials said the agency needed more than $200 million from other contributors to cover its deficit after the U.S. aid cuts.
U.S. President Donald Trump said in January he would scale back aid to the Palestinians unless they cooperated with his plans to revive peacemaking with Israel. Those peace efforts stalled in 2014.
At a specially convened session of the UNRWA Advisory Commission in Amman, Commissioner-General Pierre Krahenbuhl said that since the beginning of the year the agency had received $238 million in additional contributions after a funding drive but was not ""out of the woods"".
""We currently only have funding to run the agency's services until the end of September,"" Krahenbuhl said in a statement. ""We need a further $217 million to ensure that our schools not only open but can be run until the end of the year.""
UNRWA was founded in 1949 after the first Arab-Israel war, which led to 700,000 Palestinians being forced to leave their homes or flee. It helps around 5 million Palestinian refugees, a figure that includes descendants of those displaced by the fighting.
In January, Trump tweeted ""we pay the Palestinians HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect. They don't even want to negotiate a long overdue peace treaty with Israel."" The U.S. State Department has said the agency needed to make unspecified reforms.

Israel has accused UNRWA of favoring Palestinians and welcomed Trump's move.

The victory hands Keita a second five-year term in the mostly desert West African country where militant violence and claims of fraud by the opposition marred the poll.
Keita's now faces the giant task of lifting Mali out of a spiral of Islamist and ethnic violence in the center and north where attacks worsened in the months leading up to the vote despite the presence of U.N. and French troops. 
Threats by jihadist militants forced nearly 500 polling stations - about two percent of the total - to stay closed during Sunday's run-off, the government said. One election official was killed in northern Niafunke, in Timbuktu region.
It also meant voter turnout of over 2.7 million people was a muted 34 percent of the electorate. 
Cisse has accused the Keita's campaign of ballot stuffing and tweaking electoral rolls to secure the win, accusations Keita denies.

Despite the bitter rhetoric leading up to Thursday's results, however, the streets of Bamako and other main cities remained calm this week. The country exports gold and cotton.

WELLINGTON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Pacific island nations are holding talks which could lead to a coordinated request that China forgive mounting debts in the region amid concerns Beijing may start seizing strategic assets, Tonga's Prime Minister 'Akilisi Pōhiva said on Thursday.
Tonga, one of eight island nations in the South Pacific carrying significant debt to China, is due to start repaying loans next month after borrowing heavily in the aftermath of deadly riots in 2006 that destroyed large parts of its capital. 
China's possession of a Sri Lankan port as Colombo struggled with a spiralling debt crisis meant asset seizures could not be ruled out, Pōhiva told Reuters in a phone interview from Tonga.
""If it happens in Sri Lanka, it can happen in the Pacific - so it is entirely an option for China to consider,"" said Pōhiva, who did not identify any specific assets at risk of being seized.
""If we fail to meet the requirements and conditions set out in the agreement ... we have to pay the cost for our failure to meet the conditions.""
China's Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. It has previously said there was no evidence China was responsible for creating unsustainable debt and that it retained good relations with Tonga.
In April, media reports suggested China wanted to establish a military base in the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu after funding a wharf big enough to handle warships. Both China and Vanuatu denied the reports.
Pōhiva, who came to power after the bulk of Tonga's $115 million debt to China was accumulated, said the region should negotiate as one.
""It is no longer an issue for individual countries because there are small countries who borrowed from China and we have problems with that and the option is to collectively work together to find a way out.""
Regional leaders are due to gather at a Pacific Islands Forum early next month in the island nation of Nauru where Pōhiva said they will progress plans to ask for their debt to be forgiven. 
China, which has a status as a 'dialogue partner' in the grouping, has sent an envoy to the event since 2007.

DEBTS MOUNT 
A recent Reuters analysis of the financial books of South Pacific island nations showed China's lending programmes have gone from almost zero to over $1.3 billion currently outstanding in a decade.
The relatively high debt burdens in the small economies has stoked fears the region risks falling into financial distress and becoming more susceptible to diplomatic pressure from Beijing.
Despite holding little economic sway, each small Pacific state represents a vote at international forums such as the United Nations. They also control vast swathes of resource-rich ocean and access to the region holds strategic military significance. 
China has forgiven debt owed to it by some countries in the past. 
In 2016, China cancelled about $90 million in Cambodian debt at a time when Phnom Penh was seeking exemptions to longstanding debt to the United States. 
But Beijing has also moved ahead with fresh loans and aid to the country, becoming its most important diplomatic and economic backer as Cambodia's relations with the United States have frayed.
Australia and New Zealand, traditionally the main powers in the South Pacific, have raised concerns about China's growing influence in the region, and led efforts to give more attention and aid to their island neighbours.
Australia's Minister for International Development and the Pacific, Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, said they were worried about the impact of heavy debt levels on vulnerable economies.
""This whole issue with Tonga has gone through the Pacific like a dose of salts, and understandably, because the money they now need to repay their loan means they have less money for health and education,"" Fierravanti-Wells told Reuters in a phone interview.

New Zealand's Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters said in an emailed statement that ""over-leveraging in any situation is always a bad idea"".

KABUL (Reuters) - A suicide bomb attack on a group of teenagers studying for university exams in Kabul on Wednesday shocked Afghanistan but it was only the latest in a series of attacks on schools which have proved an easy target for militant groups.
More than 1,000 schools across Afghanistan remain closed for security reasons and at least 86 have been destroyed by militant attacks this year alone, according to U.N. figures.
""Attacks on educational institutes by hardline Islamic groups are one of the most horrific issues facing our nation today,"" said Interior Minister Wais Ahmad Barmak after Wednesday's attack on the Mawoud Academy, a private study institute in west Kabul.
Islamic State claimed responsibility for the blast, which killed at least 34 people, most of them students attending an English class.
Most of the recent attacks on schools have been outside Kabul in provinces like Nangarhar, a stronghold of Islamic State, whose tactics have become notorious since it first appeared in Afghanistan some four years ago.
Malikyar Hotak high school, in Nangarhar, has been attacked twice in the past few weeks. The first time, a remote-controlled bomb failed to go off, the second time, gunmen beheaded three guards and left the school's main hallway spattered with blood.
""Unfortunately, schools and educational institutions have become an easy target and a means of pressuring the government, for any group,"" said Kabir Haqmal, a spokesman at the ministry of education in Kabul.
The Taliban, at one time notorious for attacking schools and forcing girls and women to stay at home, now seek to influence schools by negotiation with local education officials and say they do not oppose schooling for girls.
Its rival Islamic State however, has stepped up its attacks on schools.
'NO HOLDING BACK'
Before the attack on the Malikyar school, Islamic State, also known as Daesh, issued warnings through radio broadcasts and letters to schools that they would carry out attacks in retaliation for pressure their fighters were facing.
""Daesh were saying, 'if we are not safe in the mountains, if our children are not safe in their houses, then we will not hold back from attacks on children',"" said Allah Nazar Amini, the principal of the Malikyar school.
It is a view shared by U.S. commanders in Afghanistan, who said that Islamic State, while based in Nangarhar, had sought to extend its influence in other parts of Afghanistan by hitting soft targets like schools and mosques.
UNICEF executive director Henrietta Fore said in a statement the agency was ""gravely concerned"" about the growing violence across Afghanistan.
There is serious concern about more violence with the approach of parliamentary elections on Oct. 20, with 1,000 schools set to be used as polling stations, said UNICEF communication officer Alison Parker said.
For children, the risk of violence has become a grim part of getting an education.
""I saw things in our school, you wouldn't expect to see on a battlefield,"" said 19 year-old Wasiullah, a 12th grade student at Malikyar school. 

""It hurts to see books that give a message of peace and Islam, burnt by so-called Muslims.""

Duterte's single term ends in June 2022 and he has spoken often recently about quitting before that. At two separate events on Tuesday he said he was ""ready to go"", expressing frustration about his failure to tackle illicit drugs and corruption in government.
However, he said was reluctant to do that now because a constitutional succession would mean handing power to Vice President Leni Robredo, whom he said was not up to the job.
Robredo, who leads the opposition party, was not Duterte's choice for vice president and was elected separately having narrowly defeated Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the son and namesake of the ousted former ruler.
Marcos, better known as ""Bongbong"", has challenged the result alleging fraud.
The Supreme Court has ordered a recount, a complex process that got underway in April and could take several years.
Robredo says she won fairly.
Duterte's spokesman, Harry Roque, said the president had a ""real, genuine wish to step down"" if a qualified leader could replace him. Marcos was among those he would prefer, Roque said.
""If there's development and he will win the protest and he becomes the vice president, yes, he will make true his word,"" Roque told a regular news briefing.
In a statement, Marcos expressed his gratitude to Duterte for showing faith in him, but said the president should finish his term. 

""I urge him not to leave the presidency as our people still need him for the betterment of our lives and our country,"" Marcos said.

Duterte said China has no right to repel foreign aircraft and boats passing by its artificial islands in the disputed waterway, and that he hoped China would ""temper"" its behavior and stop restricting movements.
In a statement sent to Reuters, China's Foreign Ministry said the Spratly Islands are China's inherent territory and that China respects the right to freedom of navigation and overflight that all countries enjoy in the South China Sea under international law.
""But China has a right to take necessary steps to respond to foreign aircraft and ships that deliberately get close to or make incursions into the air and waters near China's relevant islands, and provocative actions that threaten the security of Chinese personnel stationed there,"" it said.
""China urges the relevant party to meet China halfway, and jointly protect the present good situation that has not come easily in the South China Sea,"" the ministry added, without elaborating.
China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam and Brunei have competing claims to the Spratly archipelago, where China has rapidly turned reefs into artificial islands that appear to be military installations, from which its personnel routinely instruct foreign vessels to leave.
Duterte has a policy of engagement with Beijing, in the hope of securing billions of dollars in grants, loans and investments, and has rejected criticism that he is acquiescing to Chinese pressure or surrendering Philippines sovereignty.
However, instead of blaming China for building and militarizing islands in disputed waters, he has said the United States was at fault for not blocking the construction when it started.

China has been angered by the United States in particular sending military ships and aircraft close to Chinese-occupied islands in the South China Sea in the name of freedom of navigation, saying the operations are highly provocative and potentially dangerous.

Indonesian Siti Aisyah and Doan Thi Huong, a Vietnamese, face the death penalty on charges of murdering Kim Jong Nam by smearing his face with VX, a nerve agent banned by the United Nations, at a Kuala Lumpur airport on Feb. 13 last year.
Trial judge Azmi Ariffin accepted the prosecution's case that the women shared a common intention, with four individuals still at large, to cause the death of Kim Jong Nam, and ordered them to enter their defense.
""I must accordingly find that the prosecution has made a prima facie case against the accused persons and must therefore call upon them to enter their defense,"" he said as he read his judgment.
While Azmi did not rule out the possibility that the killing could have been a political assassination, there was insufficient evidence to prove it, he added.
The women will take the stand between November and February next year, the court has scheduled. 
The women, who are both in their 20s, have pleaded not guilty, saying they thought they were involved in a prank for a reality TV show.
The judge, however, said he was not persuaded by the defense argument that it could have been a prank, or a prank reality show, as there was no hidden crew and no attempt to bring the target in on the joke, as is usual in such shows.
""The sole purpose of a prank is fun with no intention to cause any type of harm ... the use of the word suggests that the act must get everyone laughing at the end, even the target,"" Azmi told the court.
After the ruling, a weeping Siti Aisyah was comforted by her lawyers and officials of the Indonesian embassy. Huong did not react.
In Vietnam, responding to Thursday's events, Huong's father, Doan Van Thanh, said, ""I don’t know what to do next. I just hope they will announce her innocent so that she can return home.""
Both women behaved similarly, even though there was no evidence they knew each other or the victim, Azmi added.
""The pattern of attack was similar, it was timely done and simultaneously done,"" he added.
Defence lawyers say the killing was politically motivated, with many key suspects linked to the North Korean embassy in the Malaysian capital, suggesting the women were simply pawns.
Siti Aisyah's lawyer Gooi Soon Seng has called the evidence against his client ""flimsy and circumstantial"" as it relied only on the security footage and the traces of VX on her.
Huong's lawyer, Hisyam Teh, has said his client's conduct after the incident was that of an innocent person.
The prosecution wrapped up closing arguments in June at the court on the outskirts of the Malaysian capital, based on testimony from 34 witnesses.
Expert witnesses testified that traces of VX were found on the clothing of both women. Video recordings played in court showed them meeting two of the fugitives at the airport before the attack. They also show Huong appearing to smear something on Kim Jong Nam's face.

Pyongyang has denied accusations by South Korean and U.S. officials that Kim Jong Un’s regime was behind the killing.

Some bodies had been double-counted when they were being taken to hospital from the blast site following the attack on Wednesday, the ministry said.
The injury toll was revised to 56 from 67.
Most of the victims were students preparing for university entrance exams in a classroom at the Mawoud Academy in an area of west Kabul where many members of the city's mainly Shi'ite Hazara community live.
Investigators said the bomber entered the center from a rear entrance and made his way into a classroom where more than 100 students had gathered.
Their funerals were due to take place on Thursday.
There has been no claim of responsibility but the Taliban denied carrying it out.
The Hazara have often been targeted by the hardline Sunni Islamic State militant group.

The blast was the latest in a wave of attacks that have killed hundreds of civilians, soldiers and policemen over recent days.

Venezuela's government has accused opposition politicians and anti-Maduro activists abroad of scheming to assassinate the leftist leader with explosives-laden drones during a military parade. 
On Tuesday, two high-ranking military officers were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the incident. Fourteen people have been arrested, while others remain at large, including in neighboring Colombia and the United States, according to Venezuelan authorities.

(Reuters) - Scientists in Florida are on the cusp of developing promising methods to control toxic algae blooms like the ""red tide"" that has been killing marine life along a 150-mile (240-km) stretch of the Gulf Coast, the head of a leading marine lab said on Wednesday.
Michael Crosby, president and chief executive of the Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota, welcomed a red tide emergency order issued this week by Governor Rick Scott, designating more state money for research, cleanup and wildlife rescues.
Interest in mitigation technologies has been heightened by a 10-month-long toxic algae bloom off Florida's southwestern coast that has caused mounds of rotting fish to wash up on beaches from Tampa to Naples.
The red tide also has been implicated in at least 266 sea turtle strandings and is suspected or determined to have caused 68 manatee deaths so far this year, according to Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission figures.
In hopes of combating future outbreaks, scientists are field testing a patented process that would pump red-algae-tainted seawater into an ozone-treatment system and then pump the purified water back into the affected canal, cove or inlet, Crosby said.
Experiments carried out in huge 25,000-gallon tanks succeeded in removing all traces of the algae and its toxins, with the water chemistry reverting to normal within 24 hours, he said.
Scientists also are studying the possible use of naturally produced compounds from seaweed, parasitic algae and filter-feeding organisms that could be introduced to fight red tides.
A ""BAD BLOOM""
Red tides occur on an almost yearly basis off Florida, starting out in the Gulf of Mexico where swarms of microscopic algae cells called Karenia brevis feed on deep-sea nutrients and are sometimes carried by currents close to shore, usually in the fall.
This year's Gulf Coast Florida bloom is the worst in more than a decade, originating last October and persisting well into the summer tourist season while spreading over 150 miles of coastline spanning seven counties.
""It's a bad bloom by any standard,"" said Richard Stumpf, an oceanographer who studies red tides for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
For reasons not well understood, strong northerly winds that normally break up a red tide by December failed to materialize last winter, Stumpf said.
It remains to be seen whether a single year of altered wind patterns will turn out to be an isolated deviation or part of more long-term changes in climate, Stumpf said. 
But scientists say red tides in and of themselves are a natural phenomenon observed as far back as the 1600s.
For humans, exposure can cause respiratory difficulties, burning eyes and skin irritation. The toxins are often fatal to marine life.

The latest bloom coincided with the spawning season for snook, an ecologically important and popular game fish in Florida, Crosby said. A portion of emergency funding ordered by the governor is earmarked for assessing impacts on that fish.

(Reuters) - A Haitian woman who was charged with child abuse at a New Mexico compound has been taken into custody by immigration authorities after living in the United States illegally for over 20 years, federal officials said on Wednesday.
Jany Leveille, 35, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Taos County on Tuesday and must appear before a judge to resolve her immigration status, according to a statement by ICE.
The immigration proceeding, which could lead to Leveille's deportation, follows a raid on the compound Aug. 3 in which police said they found 11 children living in dirty conditions with no food or water. Three days later, police unearthed the body of a toddler at the ramshackle settlement north of Taos.
""Leveille has been unlawfully present in the U.S. for more than 20 years after overstaying the validity of her non-immigrant visitor visa,"" an ICE statement said.
Kelly Golightley, Leveille's lawyer, declined comment.
Leveille moved to Brooklyn from Haiti in 1998 after their father died, according to her brother Von Chelet Leveille. She then moved several times between Georgia, Philadelphia and New York, following her separation from her first husband, Von Chelet Leveille said in a phone interview from Haiti. 
Leveille had lived at the compound near Amalia, New Mexico since January with her husband Siraj Ibn Wahhaj and children, according to prosecutors. Her six children range in age between 1 and 15, her brother said.
Leveille, Ibn Wahhaj and three other adults at the compound were charged with child abuse on Aug. 8 and their 11 children were taken into protective custody. 
The body found at the compound is believed to be that of Ibn Wahhaj's severely ill 3-year-old son, Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj. Ibn Wahhaj is accused of abducting the boy from a second wife in Georgia in December. Prosecutors allege the boy later died as Ibn Wahhaj carried out a faith-healing ritual on him at the compound.
Prosecutors have accused Ibn Wahhaj of leading firearms training for two teenage boys at the compound to carry out attacks on schools, banks and police.
Lawyers for the five defendants say they are being discriminated against because they are black Muslims who practiced faith healing and taught their children how to shoot. Neighbors and relatives dispute allegations the children were starving. 
A district judge received death threats on Tuesday after she granted bail to the defendants.

DENVER (Reuters) - A Colorado baker who won a narrow Supreme Court victory over his refusal to make a wedding cake for a gay couple is suing the state after it launched another case against him for declining to create a cake for a transgender woman.
Jack Phillips, owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop in the city of Lakewood, accuses Colorado’s Civil Rights Commission of violating his constitutional rights to free speech, freedom of religion, equal protection and due process, according to the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Denver on Tuesday.
“This lawsuit is necessary to stop Colorado’s continuing persecution of Phillips,” the written complaint alleges. Also named in the lawsuit are Governor John Hickenlooper and Cynthia Coffman, the state attorney general.
Phillips seeks permanent injunctions against the state from taking any enforcement action against Phillips, who the lawsuit says was “vindicated” by the Supreme Court ruling.
In June, the Supreme Court ruled that the Colorado’s civil rights commission was hostile toward Phillips’ Christian beliefs when it cited him for refusing to bake a wedding cake for a same-sex couple in 2012, but did not rule on whether he violated Colorado’s public accommodation statute.
Through a spokeswoman, the civil rights commission declined to comment on Phillips’ lawsuit.
The lawsuit stems from a complaint filed by Denver attorney Autumn Scardina with the civil rights commission in 2017, in which she claims that Phillips refused to bake a cake that “celebrates my transition from male to female,” court documents showed.
Scardina did not immediately return a phone message left at her law office.
The director of the state’s Civil Rights Division, Aubrey Elenis, ruled in June that Phillips discriminated against Scardina.
“The evidence thus demonstrates that the refusal to provide service to (Scardina) was based on (her) transgender status,” Elenis wrote in a probable cause determination.
The finding by Elenis requires both sides to resolve the issue through “compulsory mediation,” the document said.
Phillips is also seeking $100,000 in punitive damages against Elenis “for her unconstitutional actions,” according to the lawsuit.
Daniel Ramos, executive director of One Colorado, a group that advocates for the LGBTQ community, blasted the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), the conservative Christian group whose lawyers represent Phillips.

""We have seen the ADF launch similar lawsuits across the country that target nondiscrimination laws and civil rights agencies, and this broad lawsuit they filed on behalf of Jack Phillips reads as more of the same,” Ramos said.

1214,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>",Malaysian court to rule on women accused of killing brother of North Korean leader,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - A Malaysian court will decide on Thursday whether to continue hearing a case against two women charged with the murder of the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, or acquit them.
Indonesian Siti Aisyah and Doan Thi Huong, a Vietnamese, could face the death penalty on charges of murdering Kim Jong Nam by smearing his face with VX, a nerve agent banned by the United Nations, at a Kuala Lumpur airport on Feb. 13 last year.
The women, both in their 20s, are the only suspects in custody and have pleaded not guilty, saying they thought they were involved in a prank for a reality TV show. Four North Koreans also charged in the killing have fled Malaysia.
The prosecution made closing arguments in June at a court on the outskirts of the Malaysian capital, based on testimony from 34 witnesses. Trial judge Azmi Ariffin set Thursday to rule on whether to acquit the women or ask them to enter their defense.
""My gut is telling me the defense will be called,"" said the prosecutor Wan Shaharuddin Wan Ladin.
""The most key thing is they had VX on them and VX was shown to have killed Kim Jong Nam. So they have to explain the connection there.""
Expert witnesses testified that traces of VX were found on the clothing of both women. Video recordings played in court showed them meeting the four fugitives at the airport before the attack. They also show Huong appearing to smear something on Kim Jong Nam's face.
If the judge decides the evidence is insufficient, the case will be dismissed and both women acquitted and deported.
Defense lawyers say the killing was politically motivated, with many key suspects linked to the North Korean embassy in the Malaysian capital, suggesting the women were simply pawns.
Siti Aisyah's lawyer Gooi Soon Seng has called the evidence against his client ""flimsy and circumstantial"" as it relied only on the security footage and the traces of VX on her. 
There was no clear footage of Siti Aisyah smearing Kim's face. The recordings show only a blurry image of someone the prosecution identified as Siti Aisyah hurrying from the scene.
Huong's lawyer, Hisyam Teh, said his client's conduct after the incident was that of an innocent person, citing CCTV recordings which showed her returning to the scene of the crime two days later, when she was arrested.
""We are very confident that tomorrow justice will be served,"" Hisyam told Reuters, adding that his client had been consistent and cooperative in her police statements. 
""The judge cannot ignore the evidence before him."" 

Pyongyang has denied accusations by South Korean and U.S. officials that Kim Jong Un’s regime was behind the killing.

The U.S. State Department said adoption by the Republika Srpska (Serb Republic) government of the 2004 report on the Srebrenica genocide had been an important reconciliation step.
""The August 14 session of the Republika Srpska National Assembly is a step in the wrong direction,"" a State Department statement said. 
""Attempts to reject or amend the report on Srebrenica are part of wider efforts to revise the facts of the past war, to deny history, and to politicize tragedy. It is in the interest of the citizens of Republika Srpska to reverse the trend of revering convicted war criminals as heroes, and to ensure their crimes continue to be publicly rejected.""
A vote on Tuesday by lawmakers in Bosnia's Serb Republic to revoke the 2004 report was initiated by the region's nationalist President Milorad Dodik, and some analysts say it is the latest issue used by Serb ruling parties to mobilize voters around the nationalist agenda ahead of elections in October.
Dodik, an advocate of the Serb region's secession from Bosnia, has always rejected rulings by two war crimes courts, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and The International Court of Justice, that the Srebrenica atrocity qualified as genocide.
Though acknowledging a crime occurred, Dodik says the numbers of those killed had been exaggerated in the 2004 report and it should have included Serb victims.

The parliament concluded that a new independent international commission should be formed to determine the damages suffered by all peoples in the Srebrenica region.

""Material damaging to health did not get into the environment,"" Marton Hajdu told Reuters, adding that
Terminal 2B was shut down to facilitate a fast investigation.
""Passengers are perfectly safe, "" he added.
The terminal was shut between 7.30 p.m. (1730 GMT) and about 10.30 p.m. and eight incoming and eight outgoing flights were affected, Budapest Airport spokesman Laszlo Kurucz told Reuters.
Passengers and crew of the flight that carried the container and passengers at the airport were not in danger, according to information from the Disaster Management Authority, Hajdu added.
The officials did not name the flight or the isotope.
The national news agency MTI said the material was iridium ordered by a Hungarian company from the Russian city of Dimitrovgrad, and the container arrived in Budapest on a flight which arrived in the evening from Istanbul.
Gabor Kaszas, an official of the company, Izotop Intezet Kft, was quoted by MTI as saying that a rise in temperature was normal when such materials are transported.
Izotop Intezet is a company focused on research, development and production of radioisotopes used in healthcare, research and industry.
Officials of the company were not immediately available for comment.
A Reuters photographer at the airport saw firemen enter a Turkish Airlines plane parked on the tarmac.
Neither the airport nor the disaster control authority confirmed the flight affected was operated by Turkish Airlines, Turkish Airlines officials were not immediately available for comment.

Data on the airport's website showed that flight TK1037 from Istanbul landed in Budapest at 1907 CET, shortly before the terminal was closed.

The first families to receive damages payments will be ""the most vulnerable,"" said Roberto Waak, president of the foundation. 
The disaster, Brazil's worst environmental catastrophe, occurred when a dam designed to hold back mine waste burst in November 2015, killing 19 people and leaving a trail of destruction for hundreds of kilometers (miles).
Samarco and parent companies Vale SA and BHP Billiton (LON:BLT) Ltd said in June they had signed a deal with Brazilian authorities that settled a 20 billion reais ($5.30 billion) lawsuit related to the accident.
Waak, speaking on the sidelines of a mining event, estimated the total number of families entitled to receive damages payments would eventually rise to 60,000 but he did not say how much the remaining families would receive or when.
So far the foundation has spent 4.2 billion reais to repair damages, according to information posted in its website. 
Around 500 houses built by the foundation are expected to be delivered early next year, Waak said. 
Samarco's operations have been halted ever since the disaster.

BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The latest revelation of widespread child sexual abuse by Roman Catholic clergy has given impetus to efforts by legislators, including a Pennsylvania lawmaker who has said he was raped by a priest as a child, to make it easier to prosecute such cases. 
State Representative Mark Rozzi, 47, said he has fought for years to give people who say they were sexually assaulted as children more time to report such crimes to police in Pennsylvania, one of 14 U.S. states considering bills to extend the statute of limitations for such offenses. 
""We're going to get what the victims want,"" Rozzi said in a telephone interview on Wednesday, a day after a grand jury found that 301 priests had sexually abused about 1,000 children over the past 70 years in Pennsylvania. 
""You either support victims or you support pedophiles,"" Rozzi said.
The grand jury report was the latest revelation in a scandal that has rocked the Catholic Church since the Boston Globe in 2002 reported that priests had preyed on young boys and girls and that church leaders had covered it up.
Similar reports have emerged in Europe, Australia and Chile, prompting lawsuits, sending dioceses into bankruptcy and undercutting the moral authority of the leadership of the Church, which has some 1.2 billion members around the world.
A statute of limitations is a law requiring that prosecutors bring a criminal case within a certain time frame. The advocacy group Child USA said such statutes can block justice as children may not realize they were victims of sex crimes for decades.
Amy Hill, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Catholic Conference, the bishops' political arm in the state, declined on Wednesday to say whether bishops supported or opposed eliminating statutes of limitations.
""The time to discuss legislation will come later,"" she said. ""Our focus now is on improving ways that survivors and their families can recover.""
In the past, the group had spoken out against the idea. 
The national bishops' conference did not respond to a request for comment.
Some 41 states have eliminated statutes of limitations for criminally prosecuting child sex abuse. Earlier this year, Michigan and Hawaii passed laws giving victims more time to report sexual assaults on children.
Pennsylvania was one of the first U.S. states to raise the age for reporting child sexual abuse. In 2002 it lifted the age to 30 from 23 and five years later raised it to age 50.
State legislators are ready to take up Rozzi's bill eliminating the limit, said Steve Miskin, a spokesman for House Majority Leader Representative Dave Reed.
""It's definitely something that he's looking to bring up sooner than later,"" Miskin said.
Tuesday's report could help push through bills in states from California to New Hampshire that would relax the limits for criminal or civil action on sexual assaults on children, said Marci Hamilton, chief executive of the advocacy group Child USA.
Sexual abuse of children extends far beyond the Catholic Church, with teachers and sports coaches also facing accusations. 
Given that child abusers in positions of power can continue to assault children for decades, making it easier to prosecute them could prevent future abuse if abusers are imprisoned or lose their positions, Hamilton said in a telephone interview.
""What we want to do is to find out who the hidden child predators are,"" said Hamilton, who is also a professor of religion and law at the University of Pennsylvania.
Costs related to such cases have taken a heavy toll on church coffers, reaching nearly $600 billion since July 2013, according to a May report by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.

U.S. church leaders have said that they have implemented extensive new measures to prevent the sexual abuse of children by clergy.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. and Mexican law enforcement authorities will set up a joint team based in Chicago targeting the leaders and finances of drug cartels that ship opioids into the United States, aiming to stanch a spike in overdose deaths, officials said on Wednesday.
The announcement of a fresh effort at co-operation on security issues comes at a time of strained relations between the two neighboring countries and around four months before President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a left-leaning nationalist, is due to take power in Mexico.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to shake up Mexico's war on drug cartels and wants to rewrite the rules, aides have said, suggesting negotiated peace and amnesties rather than a hardline strategy that critics say has only perpetuated violence.
He has also said he wants to reset relations with the United States, which have been rocky since Donald Trump became U.S. president.
""We are sure the next president of the republic will be willing to collaborate in the fight against organized crime,"" Felipe de Jesus Munoz Vazquez, Mexico's deputy attorney general for the specialized investigation of federal crimes unit, told a joint U.S.-Mexican news conference in Chicago.
There was no immediate comment on Wednesday from Lopez Obrador's team, but his future security minister Alfonso Durazo has said all co-operation agreements between the two countries will be reviewed.
That includes the decade-old $2.9 billion Merida Initiative that directs aid from U.S. agencies to Mexico to fight organized crime and drug trafficking, said Durazo earlier this month.
Lopez Obrador wants to refocus aid to social and economic projects, he said. 
Targeting cartel finances was key in stopping the flow of drugs because ""the sole purpose of these entities is one thing and one thing only - money,"" said Anthony Williams, chief of operations for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, on Wednesday.
Mexico remains the principal highway for cocaine to the United States and has become the top source of heroin, which is fueling a surge in opioid addiction in the United States. It is also a major supplier of methamphetamines.
Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Mexican cartels were responsible for much of the illegal drugs flowing into the nation's third-largest city, which has been plagued by gang violence and shootings.
Officials and security experts in the United States have applauded long-running bilateral efforts to crack down on drug gangs during the administration of outgoing Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and previously.
For the past 12 years, Mexico has fought the violent cartels by deploying thousands of police, soldiers and intelligence officers.
On Wednesday, Mexico said it was offering a 30 million peso ($1.6 million) reward for information leading to the arrest of Nemesio Oseguera, whose cartel is blamed for driving heroin shipments to the United States.
Known as ""El Mencho,"" Oseguera has risen to become Mexico's most-wanted drug lord after Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman was extradited to the United States last year to face trial.
In March, U.S. agents in Chicago named El Mencho public enemy No. 1 and blamed his gang for using ""extreme violence"" to expand their share of the heroin trade. The United States is offering $5 million for information leading to his capture.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia's ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) won all 125 parliamentary seats in a national election in July, electoral authorities said on Wednesday as the opposition called the result illegitimate.
Within hours of the National Election Committee (NEC) announcement, the United States said it was expanding visa restrictions on individuals responsible for ""anti-democratic"" actions in the run-up to the July 29 vote.
Rights groups say the poll vote was neither free nor fair given the absence of a significant challenger to Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has ruled the country for more than three decades.
NEC spokesman Dim Sovannarom told Reuters the CPP won all seats and took 4.8 million of 6.9 million votes.
The only viable opposition party, the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), was dissolved last year by the Supreme Court and 118 of its members were banned from politics for five years.
CNRP leader Kem Sokha was jailed on treason charges in September. He remains in pre-trial detention.
Authorities also launched a sweeping crackdown in the lead-up to the vote targeting non-governmental organizations, rights groups and independent media.
The CPP eventually contested the ballot along with 19 other parties, none of which were particularly critical of the government. The royalist Funcinpec party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh, once Hun Sen's main rival but now aligned with him, came second with 374,510 votes.
Mu Sochua, CNRP's vice president, who lives in self-imposed exile abroad, called the new members of parliament illegitimate.
""The CPP is leading the nation to a one-party state with one man making all decisions for the entire nation through a sham election rejected by democratically elected governments,"" she told Reuters. 
""Sham elections cannot produce a legitimate National Assembly.""
Voter turnout was 83 percent, the NEC said in a separate statement on Wednesday, up from 69.6 percent in the previous election in 2013.
The CPP was banking on a high voter turnout to bestow a veneer of legitimacy on the election which many, including the United Nations and some Western countries, had criticized.
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the poll was ""flawed"" and ""neither free nor fair.""
She said the expanded visa restrictions may apply to individuals inside and outside the government ""responsible for the most notable anti-democratic actions"" in the run-up to the election and in certain circumstances to their immediate relatives.
""We reiterate our call for the Cambodian government to take tangible actions to promote national reconciliation by allowing independent media and civil society organizations to fulfill their vital roles,"" she said.
Nauert repeated U.S. calls for the release of Kem Sokha and other political prisoners and for an end to a ban on the political opposition.
Former CNRP leader Sam Rainsy, in exile in France since 2015, accused the NEC of ""artificially inflating voter turnout"" and being under the ruling party's control.
""The NEC was able to play all sorts of tricks because, after the forceful dissolution of the CNRP, the election body was placed under the absolute control of the CPP,"" he said in an emailed statement. 
Sovannarom rejected the accusations.

Following the official result, Hun Sen thanked his supporters in a message posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). ""People have decided to choose peace, development and continue to democracy in the country,"" he said.

ORLAND AIR BASE, Norway (Reuters) - Two U.S. F-22 stealth fighter jets squared off in simulated dogfights with two of Norway's expanding fleet of F-35 aircraft on Wednesday as part of an exercise aimed at strengthening the NATO alliance and increasing its deterrent power.
The two U.S. F-22s are among 13 in Europe for a series of short-term deployments in places such as Greece and Poland, with further training missions planned in undisclosed locations in coming days. 
The Norwegian deployment lasted just one day but will lay the groundwork for NATO allies as they work to integrate their stealth warfare capabilities, Colonel Leslie Hauck, chief of the fifth generation integration division at the U.S. Air Force's headquarters in Europe, told reporters in Norway.
The deployment is part of U.S. efforts to reassure European allies after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea.
Growing numbers of  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) F-35s are arriving in Europe as the world's most advanced warplane and most expensive weapons program matures following a raft of cost increases and technical challenges in its early years. 
""Every training opportunity that we have betters our readiness for any potential adversary of the future,"" Hauck said at the Orland air base, already home to six of Norway's expected 52 F-35s.
Hauck leads a new office at Ramstein Air Base in southwestern Germany, that is working to ensure a smooth transition for some 40 F-35s due to be on site in Europe by year end. The first U.S. F-35s are set to arrive in 2021.
Next month, a group of senior officials from the United States and seven other F-35 operator countries - Norway, Denmark, Italy, Turkey, Israel, Britain and the Netherlands - will meet to compare notes on the new warplane, which was first used in combat by Israel in May.
The United States already has more than 150 of the aircraft, whose sensors pilots say give them the most extensive overview about a battlefield of any combat jet available.
Norwegian Air Force Major Morten Hanche, who piloted one of the Norwegian F-35s, said the mock fight with the F-22s was great practice, especially since the F-35s generally surprise and overpower other non-stealthy aircraft.

He declined to name the winning aircraft, saying only: ""The F-22 is a very formidable opponent.""

The State Department said the move followed on from its Dec. 6 announcement that it would restrict entry to the United States of people involved in Cambodian government actions to undermine democracy, including the dissolution of the main opposition party and imprisonment of its leader Kem Sokha.
""The expanded entry restrictions may apply to individuals both within and outside the Cambodian government who are responsible for the most notable anti-democratic actions taken in the run-up to the flawed July 29 election,"" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told a news briefing.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's Workers Party registered imprisoned former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Wednesday as its candidate for the October presidential election, despite his serving a 12-year sentence for corruption and facing several more graft trials.
Several thousand supporters marched to Brazil's top electoral court chanting ""Free Lula"" and ""Lula for President"" as they accompanied top members of his PT party to register his candidacy just hours before the deadline.
While he was nominated earlier this month to be his party's candidate, Lula is expected to be barred from running by the country's top electoral court since Brazilian law bars candidates whose conviction has been upheld on appeal, which is Lula's situation. Lula has been jailed since April but still leads all election polling.
The PT will use all appeals to delay any final ruling on Lula's registration, and says he is its only candidate. Lula has chosen former Sao Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad to lead the PT ticket when he is likely barred, according to party sources. 
Police said 10,000 people participated in the march. No incidents or arrests were reported.
Lula governed Brazil for two terms from 2003-2011 and left office with a record approval rating of 87 percent due to a booming economy and social programs that lifted millions of Brazilians from poverty. 
His popularity has been hurt by corruption indictments and scandals involving his party, which was ousted from power in 2016 when his hand-picked successor was impeached for breaking budget rules.

Still, polls show about one-third of Brazilians would vote for him if he is allowed to run, almost double his nearest rival, far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro, and many of his supporters are expected to vote for whomever replaces him in the race.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel will not conduct a criminal investigation into a deadly raid in Rafah during the 2014 Gaza war, the military's judicial arm said on Wednesday after a ""comprehensive examination"" of events, prompting condemnation from the Palestinian group Hamas.
Israel launched its raid after Hamas militants, emerging from a tunnel inside Gaza, ambushed three Israeli soldiers, killing two and seizing the third. 
In their air and artillery bombardment Israeli forces killed 150 people in a matter of hours as they tried to retrieve the third soldier who was also killed.
""The findings clearly provide that the Israel Defence Force's (IDF) actions were aimed to serve a clear military purpose – to thwart the abduction of Lieutenant Hadar Goldin and attack the terror organizations in the area, by targeting military targets and military operatives,"" the judicial body, the Military Advocate General, said in a statement.
Goldin was believed at the time of the raid to still be alive, it said, adding that operations had been conducted ""with an effort to mitigate, as much as possible, harm to civilians"". 
The investigation found no evidence to suggest the IDF had intended to exact revenge for the abduction, it said.
Hamas condemned the decision.
""This emphasizes the unfairness of the Israeli inquiry and the need for an international investigation committee to probe Israel's crimes in Rafah and in all the Gaza Strip and Palestinian lands,"" Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters.
As well as the 150 people killed on August 1, 2014, medics in Gaza said around 200 were wounded, the majority civilians. It was the deadliest day of the seven-week conflict, in which more than 2,100 Palestinians, mostly civilians, were killed, as well as 67 Israeli soldiers and six civilians in Israel.
Hamas has still not returned the remains of Goldin and another soldier killed in the 2014 war. Israel is also demanding the release of two civilians whose fate is unknown and who it says are being held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

1228,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 02:14PM ET</span>",Man arrested after suspected UK parliament attack named - source,"By Darren Staples and Sarah Young
BIRMINGHAM, England/LONDON (Reuters) - A man detained on suspicion of carrying out a terrorist attack outside Britain's parliament is Salih Khater, a British citizen of Sudanese origin, a European security source told Reuters on Wednesday.
Police believe a car was deliberately driven into pedestrians and cyclists, injuring three people, before ramming a security barrier outside parliament on Tuesday morning.
The 29-year-old driver was arrested by armed officers at the scene moments later. He is currently being questioned on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism and on Wednesday was further arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, although police have said he is not co-operating with detectives.
On Wednesday police said that they had obtained a warrant to detain him for longer before deciding whether to charge him.
The security source told Reuters that Khater was from Birmingham, central England, and was not known to security services before Tuesday.
Nassar Mahmood, a trustee at Birmingham Central Mosque, said that he had spoken to members of the local Sudanese community, and understood that Khater had gone to London for visa reasons and had paperwork with him.
""He was actually trying to apply for a visa, through the Sudanese embassy, to go back to Sudan,"" he told reporters. 
Mahmood said he had heard that Khater did not worship at the mosque and had not shown signs of radicalization.
A spokesman for Coventry University, also in central England, told the Daily Telegraph newspaper Khater had studied accountancy from September 2017 until May 2018 but failed his first year course and lost his place.
On Wednesday, London police confirmed that they were satisfied they knew the identity of the arrested man, saying he was originally from Sudan although they did not name him.
In a statement, police said officers were still searching one address in the city of Birmingham but had concluded their investigations at two other properties in Birmingham and Nottingham, also in central England.
""The priority of the investigation team continues to be to understand the motivation behind this incident,"" the statement said.
Speaking shortly after the incident, Britain's counter-terrorism police chief said that given the iconic location and the method used, it appeared the incident was ""a deliberate act"" and was therefore being treated as a terrorist incident. 
Video footage showed the car veering across the road and into a security lane leading to parliament before smashing into the barrier. No one else was in the vehicle at the time and no weapons have been found.
The car involved, a silver Ford Fiesta, has been removed and the security lane was open as usual.
The Fiesta was driven down to the British capital from Birmingham on Monday night and was then in the Tottenham Court Road area, near central London's main shopping district, for about four hours, police said. 
At about 0500 GMT it headed to the Westminster and Whitehall area where parliament and most central government departments are located before the incident occurred at 0637 GMT.
PEDESTRIANIZING PARLIAMENT 
Police said the incident appeared to be the second terrorist attack at the parliament building in just under 18 months, after a British-born Muslim convert killed four people on nearby Westminster Bridge in March 2017. 
He also stabbed to death an unarmed police officer in the grounds of parliament before being shot dead.
That was the first of five attacks in Britain last year that police designated as terrorism, three of which used vehicles as weapons.
The latest attack has prompted a debate about banning traffic from the square and making it a pedestrian area, an option favored by London Mayor Sadiq Khan.
""I've been an advocate for a while now of part-pedestrianizing Parliament Square (NYSE:SQ), but making sure we don't lose the wonderful thing about our democracy which is people having access to parliamentarians, people being able to lobby parliament, and visitors being able to come and visit parliament,"" he told BBC radio.
London police chief Cressida Dick said they would discuss the idea with Khan, parliament's authorities and the intelligence agencies.
""As with anything, there is a balance to be drawn. Vehicles are on our streets all the time. We have crowds on our streets as well. The terrorists want us to completely change our way of life,"" she told LBC radio.

""We're not going to just change our lifestyle but it is important that we take reasonable measures, as I think we have been doing over the last several months to try to make sure that the most iconic sites, including those in central London, are well protected.""

HAVANA (Reuters) - A leading Cuban dissident said he was freed from jail on Wednesday, 12 days after his arrest for attempted murder following a car crash in which he hit and injured an official from the Communist-run island's interior ministry.
Jose Daniel Ferrer, leader of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), told Reuters he had been held incommunicado since his arrest over the traffic incident on Aug. 3.
Ferrer is accused of deliberately trying to run over a government official. Amnesty International, the U.S. State Department and others had demanded his release.
""They have not taken away the charge of attempted murder. They simply lifted my preventive detention,"" Ferrer said in a telephone interview.
Based on previous experience, he suggested it could be months or even years before authorities offer any clarity about his legal status and how the case against him might end.
""The investigation is continuing to decide if it goes to court. In 2012 they charged me with organizing public disturbances and six years later they have not brought me before the court,"" he said. 
Ferrer claims the incident was an accident and the official was only slightly injured.
Ferrer was on his way to visit his daughter with UNPACU member Ebert Hidalgo Cruz when the vehicle he was driving struck the government official, according to a statement UNPACU posted on YouTube. 
It said he has no license to drive but had taken the wheel to practice, when the official suddenly drove his motorcycle in front of the vehicle. 
Hildago, who was also arrested but freed earlier this week, said Ferrer swerved to avoid the official, who was only slightly injured and drove away from the scene.
The two men were arrested in their Santiago homes later in the day.
Government officials were not immediately available to comment on Ferrer's release and the status of the case against him.
The Cuban government considers all dissidents to be agents of the United States. It regularly detains them for a few hours or days, as part of what critics and human rights groups describe as a long-running campaign of harassment and repression. 

Ferrer was imprisoned in 2003, along with 74 other dissidents in a nationwide crackdown. He was released on parole in 2011 and soon after formed UNPACU, which has become one of Cuba’s largest and most active opposition organizations.

It said the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had failed to pressure prison officials into providing proper medical care for those on hunger strike.
""Therefore the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan announces the withdrawal of security commitment that had given to the International Red Cross for their activities in Afghanistan,"" it said in a statement.
""The Islamic Emirate henceforth does not guarantee the protection of their lives and property until they come to an agreement with the Islamic Emirate to correct their actions.""
ICRC spokeswoman Sanela Bajrambasic said Red Cross representatives last visited Pul-e Charkhi prison on Monday to follow up on medical services provided to prisoners on hunger strike and provide intravenous solution.
As a neutral organization, she said the Red Cross took no position on the reasons or goals of the hunger strike and was neither trying to persuade the prisoners to end the hunger strike nor authorities to accept their demands.
She said the Red Cross tried to build relationships with all parties to the conflict in Afghanistan, where it has worked for more than 30 years.
""We rely on the parties to allow us to work in safety to protect and assist victims of the conflict. This is our sole objective,"" she said.
She said the organization would engage directly with the Taliban and would not comment publicly. 
The Red Cross announced last year it was scaling back operations in Afghanistan after attacks killed a number of its staff.

ASUNCION (Reuters) - Former senator Mario Abdo Benitez took office as Paraguay's new president on Wednesday, pledging to cut poverty and fight corruption after winning national elections in April, but major changes to economic policy were not expected.
Abdo, 46, a conservative Colorado party politician, replaces businessman and Colorado party member Horacio Cartes, a former soft-drink and tobacco executive who oversaw one of Latin America's highest growth rates and raised Paraguay's presence in global bond markets in his five-year term.
The presidential ceremony was attended by South American leaders and Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen. Paraguay is one of the few countries to maintain regular diplomatic relations with Taiwan.
Cartes, who was not eligible for re-election, tried to resign in July to become a national senator, but Congress rejected his resignation, obliging him to complete his mandate.
""Paraguay will continue to grow, but we need more inclusive economic growth, to get our people out of extreme poverty, to reduce unemployment,"" Abdo said.
More than a quarter of Paraguayans live in poverty, according to World Bank statistics.
While Abdo campaigned on a promise to continue Cartes' business-friendly policies, he also said the country would pursue more aggressive tax policies to increase government coffers.

The landlocked South American country is one of the world's largest exporters of soybeans.

KAMPALA (Reuters) - Ugandan legislator Francis Zaake, detained after the president's convoy was stoned, has been ""brutalised"" by security personnel, an opposition figure said on Wednesday as images of the bruised lawmaker emerged on social media.
Supporters of an independent candidate running in a parliamentary by-election threw stones at President Yoweri Museveni's motorcade on Monday in the West Nile region near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo, police and Museveni said.
Police used tear gas and shots to halt the stoning and detained at least five members of parliament along with several other people.
Those arrested included Robert Kyagulanyi, an independent lawmaker and musician who has gained popularity since he joined parliament last year through scathing criticism of Museveni's government, sometimes expressed through music.
During Monday's incident, Kyagulanyi's driver was shot dead, according to police who have said they are not yet able to identify who shot him. 
Mugisha Muntu, a former head of Forum for Democratic Change (FDC), Uganda's biggest opposition party, said on Twitter: ""Hon. Zaake was badly brutalized by security forces ... journalists too weren't spared. We must reject this lawlessness.""
Images circulated on WhatsApp and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) showing Zaake apparently lying on a bed, eyes closed, with a swollen face and a cut ear. One of his hands was swollen while the other had a wounded palm. 
Muntu also said on Twitter that Kyagulanyi was being held incommunicado and was ""in urgent need of medical attention.""
Police did not answer repeated calls for comment and Museveni's spokesman Don Wanyama also did not answer a Reuters' call for comment.
Deputy Prime Minister Moses Ali told parliament Kyagulanyi ""was found with a gun"" and would appear before a court martial in Gulu, northern Uganda, on Thursday. Ali said 33 people had been arrested in connection with the incident.
Rights activists have long accused Museveni's government of using tactics including beatings by security forces and detentions to stifle opposition to his rule.
Officials reject those accusations and say Museveni's rule is based on mass support.
Critics say Museveni, who has been in power since 1986, is set to rule for life after parliament last year scrapped an age limit for presidential candidates.
Kizza Besigye, who has run against and lost to Museveni four times, has been jailed dozens of times for alleged offences including illegal assemblies, rape and treason. Besigye says the prosecutions are politically motivated. He has won some cases in court while others are pending.
Museveni blamed the stoning on ""weak management by the police and the criminal behavior of some of the opposition leaders.""
""Some leaders have been acting with impunity ... these acts are strongly rejected and will be punished,"" he said in a statement, adding he was unharmed in the incident.
Police have said they are investigating the MPs for blocking Museveni's convoy among other offences.

(Reuters) - Voter engagement in the 2018 U.S. midterm races remains feverish, primaries in notable swing states Wisconsin and Minnesota showed on Tuesday.
Both states showed sharp increases in participation as voters picked candidates for Congress, Senate and governor, with Minnesota's turnout surpassing a two-decade high and Wisconsin's hitting levels not reached for a state primary since at least 2002. [L1N1V50KY] 
Democrats are hoping to replicate successes seen around the nation throughout the past 18 months in local and state special elections, where high levels of enthusiasm have propelled them to victories in races from Alabama's Senate seat in December to a southwest Pennsylvania congressional district in March. 
The party is desperately seeking to flip control of Congress and capture more statehouses across the nation, as Republicans have control of both houses of Congress and the majority of state legislatures.
In Minnesota, more than 900,000 voters turned out in a state known for high levels of voter engagement, according to unofficial state figures on Wednesday. That equals a turnout rate of roughly 22 percent, according to Minnesota's secretary of state.
It was also the highest for state primary nominating contests since 1994, not including presidential primaries, according to state data. More than 580,000 people voted on the Democratic side.
""Competitive races for open seats, and partisan enthusiasm for many of the candidates in a highly polarized climate, fueled the high turnout,"" said Kathryn  Pearson  (LON:PSON), political science professor at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.
'ENTHUSIASM IS HIGH'
In Wisconsin, nearly 1 million voters cast ballots, or about 22 percent of the voting-age population, surpassing the 14 percent rate posted in both 2016 and 2014, according to a spokesman for the Wisconsin Elections Commission. That is the highest since a 22.5 percent turnout rate in 2002, but the official figure could still exceed that when all votes are counted.
Turnout was strong in Democratic strongholds such as Madison, the state capital, and the largest city, Milwaukee, but also in Republican suburbs around Milwaukee. 
Democrats picked Tony Evers to challenge Governor Scott Walker, who is seeking a third term, while Republicans chose state senator Leah Vukmir as their opponent to Democratic U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin. Early polls have shown the governor's race to be close, with Baldwin holding larger leads in polls of the Senate race.
""Democratic enthusiasm is obviously high: They've won two key special elections for state senate seats and a Supreme Court election. If the election were held today, it's highly unlikely that Trump would carry Wisconsin again,"" said Charlie Sykes, a conservative commentator and longtime Trump critic. 
Trump became the first Republican to win Wisconsin in 32 years when he edged out Hillary Clinton there in 2016.
However, David Canon, professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison, said not too much could be read into Tuesday's turnout given several hot contests in the state. 
All 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate will be decided in November's contests.
Democrats are trying to recapture at least one house of Congress to stall Trump's agenda and have promised additional oversight of the president. Republicans are trying to motivate voters by promoting the strong economy and tax-cut legislation while Trump's approval rating remains in the low 40s.

The ship, run by the Franco-German charity SOS Mediterranee and Doctors without Borders (MSF), was allowed in after France, Germany, Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain agreed on Tuesday to take in the migrants, who were rescued off the coast of Libya. 
Aid groups said there were more than 70 children on board. 
The EU countries will also take some of a group of 114 migrants who were rescued by the Maltese armed forces and brought to Malta on Monday.
The row was the latest tussle illustrating how politically fraught the issue of coping with seaborne migrants remains despite a deal on migration that EU leaders agreed on at a summit in June.
Malta had initially argued that the migrants on board the Aquarius should be taken to Libya, Tunisia or the Italian island of Lampedusa, all closer to the rescue points.
As the ship docked, members of a right-wing group Moviment Patrijotti Maltin (Malta Patriotic Movement) unfurled a banner reading ""Stop Human Trafficking"". Next to them, crew members of another rescue vessel, the MV Lifeline, held up a banner of their own reading ""Everyone has a right to life.""
A government spokesman said the ship's migrants, mostly from Eritrea and Somalia, would be given an initial medical check before being taken to a reception center.

This was the second time in as many months that the Aquarius was at the heart of a Mediterranean standoff. It was refused entry by Italy and Malta in June, and the boat eventually docked in Spain, which took in its migrants.

KABUL (Reuters) - A suicide blast in a mainly Shi'ite area of Kabul killed at least 48 people on Wednesday, the latest in a wave of attacks that have killed hundreds of civilians, soldiers and policemen over recent days.
The explosion, targeting an educational center in the west of the Afghan capital, tore through a large tent set up as a classroom in the courtyard, killing dozens of teenagers studying for a university entrance examination. The blast, which shattered weeks of relative calm in Kabul, also wounded at least 67, including both male and female students.
""Most of the boys at the educational center have been killed,"" said Sayed Ali, who witnessed the blast. ""It was horrific and many of the students were torn to pieces.""
Doctors at city hospitals, where people had gathered to try to find relatives who had been studying at the center, said many of the victims were severely burned.
""My brother was studying at the center and he was killed. I'm here to get his body,"" said Abdul Khaliq, waiting outside the Isteqlal hospital.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the Kabul blast but the attack bore the hallmark of Islamic State, which has conducted many previous attacks on Shi'ite targets. The Taliban issued a statement denying it was involved. 
The explosion, which came as the central city of Ghazni struggles to recover from five days of intense fighting between the Taliban and government forces, underlined how badly security in Afghanistan has degenerated, some two months before parliamentary elections scheduled for October.
Earlier on Wednesday, local officials said at least nine policemen and 35 soldiers were killed in an attack on their base in the northern province of Baghlan, the latest of a series that has killed dozens of members of the security forces nationwide.
The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan called for the fighting to stop, saying up to 150 civilians are estimated to have been killed in Ghazni, where the public hospital was overwhelmed and water and electricity supplies cut.
""The extreme human suffering caused by the fighting in Ghazni highlights the urgent need for the war in Afghanistan to end,"" the top U.N. official in Afghanistan, Tadamichi Yamamoto, said in a statement.
TALIBAN PULLBACK
The Taliban, who launched their Ghazni assault last Friday and battled Afghan forces backed by U.S. air strikes in the middle of the city for days, said their fighters had been pulled out to prevent further harm to the city's population. 
""They were facing severe shortages of food and drinking water as the power supply was also suspended two days ago,"" a Taliban commander, who declined to be identified, said by telephone.
The International Committee of the Red Cross said it was providing dressing packages and oral and intravenous medicine to treat the wounded, along with electricity generators and fresh water for about 18,000 people.
The Ghazni attack, one of the Taliban's most devastating in years, has clouded hopes for peace talks that had been prompted by an unprecedented ceasefire during the Eid celebration in June and a meeting last month between Taliban officials and a senior U.S. diplomat.
Two senior Taliban leaders told Reuters this week the group was considering announcing a ceasefire for the feast of Eid-al Adha, which begins next week, but the future of any peace process remained uncertain.
With parliamentary elections due on Oct. 20, authorities had been bracing for more attacks in Kabul and other cities, but even so, the scale of the violence has come as a shock to a government facing bitter criticism over its handling of the war.
In the southern province of Zabul, Taliban insurgents clashed with soldiers on Tuesday, forcing the government to send reinforcements from neighboring provinces to retain control of two checkposts. 
The clashes killed 11 soldiers and one policeman, with three soldiers wounded, said Haji Atta Jan Haqbayan, a Zabul provincial council member.

Separately, six girls younger than 10 were killed when an unexploded mortar they picked up to play with suddenly exploded on Wednesday, officials in the eastern province of Laghman said.

1237,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 11:54AM ET</span>",Anger at Italy bridge operator as hunt for survivors goes on,"By Ilaria Polleschi
GENOA, Italy (Reuters) - Italian rescuers searched for survivors among towering slabs of concrete wreckage in Genoa on Wednesday after a bridge collapse killed 39 people and sparked a furious government reaction against the viaduct's operator.
The 50-year-old bridge, part of a toll motorway linking the port city of Genoa with southern France, collapsed during torrential rain on Tuesday, sending dozens of vehicles crashing onto a riverbed, a railway and two warehouses.
Eye-witness Ivan, 37, evacuated on Tuesday from the nearby building where he works, described the collapse as unbelievable.
""To see a pylon come down like papier-mâché is an incredible thing,"" he said. ""It's been a lifetime that we've known there were problems. It is in continual maintenance."" 
""In the '90s they added some reinforcements on one part, but also underneath you can see rust.""
As cranes moved in to shift truck-sized chunks of broken concrete, hundreds of firefighters searched for survivors, while public shock and grief turned to anger over the state of the 1.2 km-long bridge, completed in 1967 and overhauled two years ago.
Italian Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli, visiting the disaster scene, said bridge operator Autostrade per l'Italia would have to contribute to the cost of its reconstruction as well as pay heavy fines.
But Autostrade, a unit of Milan-listed Atlantia group, said it had done regular, sophisticated checks on the structure before the disaster, relying on ""companies and institutions which are world leaders in testing and inspections"" and that these had provided reassuring results.
""These outcomes have formed the basis for maintenance work approved by the Transport Ministry in accordance with the law and the terms of the concession agreement,"" it said.
A source close to the matter said Autostrade per l'Italia would hold an extraordinary board meeting next week following the disaster.
WEIGHT OF TRAFFIC
The bridge's condition, and its ability to sustain large increases in both the intensity and weight of traffic over the years, have been a focus of public debate since Tuesday's collapse, when an 80-metre (260-foot) span gave way at lunchtime as cars and trucks streamed across it.
Salvatore Lorefice, 58, a pensioner who lives a few hundred meters (yards) from the bridge, said cement had fallen off the structure as early as the 1980s when he worked at a warehouse directly under the bridge.
He recalled a visit by a team of Japanese technicians who ""came to find out how the structure had deteriorated in such a short time"".
Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said the private sector manager of the bridge had earned ""billions"" from tolls but ""did not spend the money they were supposed to"" and its concession should be revoked.
He was apparently referring to Autostrade.
""Imposing the highest penalties possible and making sure that those responsible for the dead and the injured pay up for any damages and crimes is the very least,"" he said.
The Pope offered a prayer for the victims and their loved ones in a public address at St Peter's Basilica.
Fire brigade spokesman Luca Cari said 400 firefighters were at the site, helped by cranes that cleared away large rubble and created spaces for rescue teams to check for survivors.
In Paris, France's foreign ministry said four French nationals were among the dead.
Toninelli earlier said he had begun a process to strip Autostrade of its concession and he demanded top managers at the firm resign.
""Autostrade per l'Italia was not able to fulfill its obligations under the contract regulating management of this infrastructure,"" Toninelli said on RAI 1 state TV, adding he would seek to levy heavy fines against the company that could reach up to 150 million euros.
Autostrade's top two officials have no plans to resign, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
STRUCTURAL INSPECTIONS
The Morandi Bridge, named after the engineer who designed it, forms part of the A10 motorway run by Autostrade. The 55-km (34 mile) stretch of the A10 accounts for around 1.7 percent of total network traffic for Italy's biggest toll road operator, according to one analyst's estimate.
Autostrade's parent, Atlantia, also runs toll-road concessions in Brazil, Chile, India and Poland.
""The top management of Autostrade per l'Italia must step down first of all,"" Toninelli said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post.
He also said the government would inspect the structure of ageing bridges and tunnels across the country with a view to launching a program of remedial works if required.
Within hours of the disaster, the anti-establishment government that took office in June said the collapse showed Italy needed to spend more on its dilapidated infrastructure, ignoring EU budget constraints if necessary.

Genoa police put the death toll at 39, with 16 injured.

Khamenei, who rarely admits in public to making errors, said he had done just that over the nuclear talks. ""With the issue of the nuclear negotiations, I made a mistake in permitting our foreign minister to speak with them. It was a loss for us,"" he said.
The comments made by Khamenei, the highest authority in the country, were tweeted on Wednesday by the Khat-e Hezbollah newspaper, a weekly affiliated with his official website.
Khamenei made the remarks on Monday, but the newspaper said it was now quoting them due to inaccurate accounts published previously by other media. 
Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif negotiated the deal with counterparts from six powers, including then U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. Tehran undertook to curb its nuclear program in return for relief from the international sanctions which have been throttling its economy.
New U.S. sanctions against Iran took effect last week, and Trump said companies doing business with the country will be barred from the United States. Washington had said Tehran’s only chance of avoiding the sanctions would be to accept an offer by Trump to negotiate a tougher nuclear deal.
Iranian officials, from Khamenei down, have rejected the offer. Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri said on Wednesday that the United States is trying to make Tehran surrender through the imposition of sanctions.
“The first priority for all of us under a sanctions situation is to work toward managing the country in a way that brings the least amount of damage to people’s lives,” Fars News quoted Jahangiri as saying. “America is trying by applying various pressures on our society to force us to retreat and surrender.”
The new sanctions targeted Iranian purchases of U.S. dollars, metals trading, coal, industrial software and its auto sector, though the toughest measures targeting oil exports do not take effect for four more months.
Few U.S. companies do much business in Iran so the impact of sanctions mainly stems from Washington’s ability to block European and Asian firms from trading there.
President Hassan Rouhani made similar comments to Jahangiri, although he did not specifically refer to the United States. ""We will not let the enemy bring us to our knees,"" Rouhani said, according to state TV.
""America itself took actions which destroyed the conditions for negotiation,"" Rouhani also said, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA). ""There were conditions for negotiation and we were negotiating. They destroyed the bridge themselves,"" he said. ""If you're telling the truth then come now and build the bridge again."" 
The Iranian economy is beset by high unemployment and a rial currency which has lost half its value since April. The reimposition of sanctions could also make the economic situation worse.
Rouhani said the economy is the biggest problem facing the country. 

Thousands of Iranians have protested in recent weeks against sharp price rises of some food items, a lack of jobs and state corruption. The protests over the cost of living have often turned into anti-government rallies.

1240,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 11:24AM ET</span>",Florida school opens for class with new security after massacre,"By Bernie Woodall
PARKLAND, Fla. (Reuters) - The Florida high school where a gunman killed 17 people in February opened on Wednesday for a new school year with three armed guards and other new security measures that some parents and students worried would not be enough.
Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, doubled its campus security detail to 18, including three armed uniformed sheriff's deputies. The school's 3,300 students wore new identification badges as they funneled through three entrances at the sprawling 45-acre campus.
During the school year, only one heavily monitored entrance will allow visitors on campus.
""I know the extra security is necessary, but it makes you know that your school isn’t normal,"" Nariah Depina, a 15-year-old sophomore, said as she arrived for the first day of class.
School administrators considered and then opted against requiring students to use see-through backpacks or installing metal detectors, finding it would be too difficult to screen all students each morning before class.
On Feb. 14, in the third deadliest shooting by a single gunman at a U.S. school, police say Nikolas Cruz, 19, opened fire on teenagers and teachers with an assault-style weapon. Cruz, who had been expelled from Stoneman Douglas, is awaiting trial on 17 counts of first-degree murder. 
The latest outburst of violence in a decades-long series of shootings at U.S. schools and colleges prompted Stoneman Douglas students to help form a nationwide youth-led gun control movement. The U.S. House of Representatives did not tighten gun laws but did approve more spending for school security.
Broward County schools Superintendent Robert Runcie defended the security decisions, including the lack of metal detectors, from criticism by parents and some school board members, but acknowledged that anxieties remained high.
In addition to more security personnel, including the number of armed law enforcement officers increased to three from one, students were greeted with classroom doors that lock automatically.
There are also new gates and fences on the campus. The building where most of the killing occurred is fenced-off, replaced by 32 temporary structures housing classrooms, restrooms and administrative offices.
The county school board in April rejected funding from a new state program intended to arm teachers.
Runcie told reporters that checking student backpacks and the newly required identification cards did not create significant delays. Most students expressed confidence that the school was as secure as possible.
Sophomore Orion Jean, 15, said he was not concerned about the lack of metal detectors, which he believed would only ""keep honest people honest.""
Anyone intent on killing would still ""find a way to do it,"" he said.
Anthony Erale, 16, a junior who plays on the football team, said he did not think all the security was necessary.

""We already had our tragedy,"" he said.

1241,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 11:01AM ET</span>",Special Report: Why Facebook is losing the war on hate speech in Myanmar,"By Steve Stecklow
YANGON, Myanmar (Reuters) - In April, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) founder Mark Zuckerberg told U.S. senators that the social media site was hiring dozens more Burmese speakers to review hate speech posted in Myanmar. The situation was dire.
Some 700,000 members of the Rohingya community had recently fled the country amid a military crackdown and ethnic violence. In March, a United Nations investigator said Facebook was used to incite violence and hatred against the Muslim minority group. The platform, she said, had ""turned into a beast.""
Four months after Zuckerberg's pledge to act, here is a sampling of posts from Myanmar that were viewable this month on Facebook:
One user posted a restaurant advertisement featuring Rohingya-style food. ""We must fight them the way Hitler did the Jews, damn kalars!"" the person wrote, using a pejorative for the Rohingya. That post went up in December 2013.
Another post showed a news article from an army-controlled publication about attacks on police stations by Rohingya militants. ""These non-human kalar dogs, the Bengalis, are killing and destroying our land, our water and our ethnic people,"" the user wrote. ""We need to destroy their race."" That post went up last September, as the violence against the Rohingya peaked.
A third user shared a blog item that pictures a boatload of Rohingya refugees landing in Indonesia. ""Pour fuel and set fire so that they can meet Allah faster,"" a commenter wrote. The post appeared 11 days after Zuckerberg's Senate testimony.
The remarks are among more than 1,000 examples Reuters found of posts, comments, images and videos attacking the Rohingya or other Myanmar Muslims that were on Facebook as of last week. Almost all are in the main local language, Burmese. The anti-Rohingya and anti-Muslim invective analyzed for this article – which was collected by Reuters and the Human Rights Center at UC Berkeley School of Law – includes material that's been up on Facebook for as long as six years.
The poisonous posts call the Rohingya or other Muslims dogs, maggots and rapists, suggest they be fed to pigs, and urge they be shot or exterminated. The material also includes crudely pornographic anti-Muslim images. The company's rules specifically prohibit attacking ethnic groups with ""violent or dehumanising speech"" or comparing them to animals. Facebook also has long had a strict policy against pornographic content.
The use of Facebook to spread hate speech against the Rohingya in the Buddhist-majority country has been widely reported by the U.N. and others. Now, a Reuters investigation gives an inside look at why the company has failed to stop the problem.
For years, Facebook – which reported net income of $15.9 billion in 2017 – devoted scant resources to combat hate speech in Myanmar, a market it dominates and in which there have been regular outbreaks of ethnic violence. In early 2015, there were only two people at Facebook who could speak Burmese reviewing problematic posts. Before that, most of the people reviewing Burmese content spoke English.
To this day, the company continues to rely heavily on users reporting hate speech in part because its systems struggle to interpret Burmese text.
Even now, Facebook doesn't have a single employee in the country of some 50 million people. Instead, it monitors hate speech from abroad. This is mainly done through a secretive operation in Kuala Lumpur that's outsourced to Accenture, the professional services firm, and codenamed ""Project Honey Badger.""
According to people familiar with the matter, the project, which handles many Asian countries, hired its first two Burmese speakers, who were based in Manila, just three years ago. As of June, Honey Badger had about 60 people reviewing reports of hate speech and other content posted by Myanmar's 18 million active Facebook users. Facebook itself in April had three full-time Burmese speakers at a separate monitoring operation at its international headquarters in Dublin, according to a former employee.
Honey Badger employees typically sign one-year renewable contracts and agree not to divulge that the client is Facebook. Reuters interviewed more than a half-dozen former monitors who reviewed Southeast Asian content.
A Facebook official said outsourcing its content monitoring is more efficient because the companies it uses are specialists in ramping up such operations. He declined to disclose how many Burmese speakers the company has on the job worldwide, saying it was ""impossible to know, to be definitive on that.""
""It's not enough,"" he added.
For many people in this emerging economy, Facebook is the internet: It's so dominant, it's the only site they use online. Yet, the company ignored repeated warnings as far back as 2013 that it faced trouble.
Researchers and human rights activists say they cautioned Facebook for years that its platform was being used in Myanmar to promote racism and hatred of Muslims, in particular the Rohingya.
""They were warned so many times,"" said David Madden, a tech entrepreneur who worked in Myanmar. He said he told Facebook officials in 2015 that its platform was being exploited to foment hatred in a talk he gave at its headquarters in Menlo Park, California. About a dozen Facebook people attended the meeting in person, including Mia Garlick, now the company's director of Asia Pacific policy, he said. Others joined via video. ""It couldn't have been presented to them more clearly, and they didn't take the necessary steps,"" Madden said.
In a statement, Garlick told Reuters: ""We were too slow to respond to the concerns raised by civil society, academics and other groups in Myanmar. We don't want Facebook to be used to spread hatred and incite violence. This is true around the world, but it is especially true in Myanmar where our services can be used to amplify hate or exacerbate harm against the Rohingya.""
She added that Facebook is focused on addressing challenges that are unique to Myanmar ""through a combination of people, technology, policies and programs."" The company also said it has banned several ""hate figures and organizations"" on Facebook in Myanmar.
Facebook's struggles in Myanmar are among much broader problems it faces. Zuckerberg's congressional testimony in April primarily focused on the company's mishandling of user data, whether it censors conservative views and Russia's exploitation of Facebook to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Of all of Facebook's travails, though, Myanmar may be the bloodiest. The Myanmar military stands accused by the U.N. of having conducted a brutal campaign of killings, mass rape, arson and ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya. The government denies the allegations.
The social media giant doesn't make public its data on hate speech in Myanmar. It says it has 2.2 billion global users and each week receives millions of user reports from around the world about problematic content.
In compiling examples of hate speech for this article, Reuters found some that Facebook subsequently removed. But the vast majority remained online as of early August.
After Reuters alerted Facebook to some of the derogatory posts included in this story, the company said it removed them. ""All of it violated our policies,"" it said.
Reuters itself sometimes flags to Facebook threats posted on the platform against its reporters. These include the Burmese journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who are on trial in Myanmar on charges of violating a state secrets law. The two were arrested in December while reporting on the massacre of 10 Rohingya men and have received a deluge of death threats on social media over their story. Facebook has removed such content several times at the news agency's request.
'SENDING FLOWERS'
Myanmar emerged from decades of military rule in 2011, but religious violence has marred its transition to democracy. In 2012, clashes in Rakhine State between ethnic Rakhine, who are Buddhists, and the Rohingya killed scores of people and left 140,000 displaced – mostly Muslims.
Facebook's extraordinary dominance in Myanmar began taking root around the same time. But not by design.
As recently as six years ago, Myanmar was one of the least connected countries on earth. In 2012, only 1.1 percent of the population used the internet and few people had telephones, according to the International Telecommunication Union, a U.N. agency. The junta that had ruled the country for decades kept citizens isolated.
That all changed in 2013, when a quasi-civilian government oversaw the deregulation of telecommunications. The state-owned phone company suddenly faced competition from two foreign mobile-phone entrants from Norway and Qatar.
The price of SIM cards dropped from more than $200 to as little as $2 and people purchased them in droves. By 2016, nearly half the population had mobile phone subscriptions, according to GSMA Intelligence, the research arm of the industry's trade association. Most purchased smartphones with internet access.
One app went viral: Facebook. Many saw it as an all-in-one solution – offering a messaging system, news, and videos and other entertainment. It also became a status symbol, said Chris Tun, a former Deloitte consultant who advised the government. ""If you don't use Facebook, you're behind,"" he said. ""Even grandmas, everyone was on Facebook.""
To capture customers, Myanmar's mobile phone operators began offering a sweet deal: use Facebook without paying any data charges.
""Facebook should be sending flowers to me, because we have been an accelerator for bringing the penetration,"" said Lars Erik Tellmann, who until July was chief executive of Telenor Myanmar, part of Norway's Telenor Group. ""This was an initiative we took fully on our own. And this was extremely popular.""
In Myanmar today, the government itself uses Facebook to make major announcements, including the resignation of the president in March.
'GENOCIDE ALL OF THE MUSLIMS'
In the fall of 2013, Aela Callan, an Australian documentary filmmaker studying at Stanford University, began a project on hate speech and false reports that had spread online during conflicts between Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims the prior year. In June 2012, at least 80 people had died in riots and thousands of Rohingya were moved into squalid internment camps. Anti-Rohingya diatribes appeared on Facebook. One Buddhist nationalist group set up a page called the ""Kalar Beheading Gang.""
In November 2013, she met at Facebook's California headquarters with Elliott Schrage, vice president of communications and public policy. ""I was trying to alert him to the problems,"" she said.
Emails between the two show that Schrage put Callan in touch with internet.org, a Facebook initiative to bring the internet to developing countries, and with two Facebook officials, including one who worked with civil-society organizations to assist the company in coping with hate speech.
""He didn't connect me to anyone inside Facebook who could deal with the actual problem,"" she said.
Asked for comment, Schrage referred Reuters to a press person at Facebook. The company didn't comment on the meeting.
Matt Schissler, a doctoral student at the University of Michigan, said that between March and December 2014, he held discussions with Facebook officials in a series of calls and online communications. He told them how the platform was being used to spread hate speech and false rumors in Myanmar, he said, including via fake accounts. He and other activists provided the company with specific examples, including a Facebook page in Burmese that was called, ""We will genocide all of the Muslims and feed them to the dogs."" The page was removed.
Schissler belonged to a private Facebook group that was set up so that Myanmar human rights activists, researchers and company employees such as Asia Pacific policy chief Garlick could discuss how to cope with hate speech and other issues. The activists brought up numerous problems with Facebook's multi-step reporting system for problematic content. As one example, they cited a photograph of an aid worker in Rakhine State in a post that called him ""a traitor to the nation."" It had been shared 229 times, according to messages reviewed by Reuters.
One of the private group's members had reported it to Facebook as harassment of an individual but later received a message back: ""We reviewed the photo you reported for containing hate speech or symbols and found it doesn't violate our Community Standards."" After multiple complaints by activists over six weeks, a Facebook employee finally explained to the activists that the takedown request was rejected because the photo had been reported, but not the comment above it. It eventually was taken down.
In March 2015, Schissler gave a talk at Facebook's California headquarters about new media, particularly Facebook, and anti-Muslim violence in Myanmar. More than a dozen Facebook employees attended, he said.
Two months later, Madden, the tech entrepreneur, gave a talk at Facebook headquarters about tensions and violence between Buddhists and Muslims. He said he showed a doctored picture that had spread on Facebook of the country's de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, who is Buddhist, wearing a Muslim head scarf. The image, Madden said, was meant to imply she was sympathetic to Muslims – a ""very negative message"" in Myanmar.
""The whole point of this presentation was really just to sound the alarm, to show very vividly the context in which Facebook was operating, and already the evidence of how it was being misused,"" he said. He left the meeting thinking his audience took the talk seriously and would take action.
Madden had founded a technology hub and start-up accelerator in Yangon called Phandeeyar. He said he and others involved with the venture interacted with Facebook ""many dozens"" of times over the next several years, including via email, in the private Facebook group and in person, showing how the network's systems for detecting and removing dangerous content were ineffective. He isn't sure what steps the company took in response. ""The central problem is that the mechanisms that they have to pull down hate speech in a timely way, before it does real world harm, they don't work,"" he said.
Madden and Jes Kaliebe Petersen, Phandeeyar's chief executive, said Facebook was still relying too much on their group and other volunteers to report dangerous posts. ""It shouldn't be incumbent on an organization like ours or people who happen to be well-connected with folks inside Facebook to report these things,"" Petersen said.
In April, shortly before Zuckerberg's Senate testimony, Phandeeyar and five other Myanmar groups blasted him for claiming in an interview with Vox that Facebook's systems had detected and removed incendiary messages in September last year. ""We believe your system, in this case, was us,"" they wrote. Zuckerberg apologized.
Back in 2014, tech organizations and researchers weren't the only ones sounding alarms with Facebook. So was the Myanmar government.
In July of that year, riots broke out in the central city of Mandalay after false rumors spread online, on Facebook and elsewhere, that a Muslim man had raped a Buddhist woman. A Buddhist man and a Muslim man were killed in the fighting.
The Myanmar government asked Tun, then a Deloitte consultant, to contact the company. He said he didn't succeed at first, and the government briefly blocked Facebook.
Tun said he eventually helped to arrange meetings between the government and Facebook. ""What they promised to do was, when you spot fake news, you could contact them via email,"" Tun said of Facebook. ""And they would take action – they were willing to take down pages after their own verification process.""
The government began reporting cases to Facebook, but Tun said he quickly realized the company couldn't deal with Burmese text. ""Honestly, Facebook had no clue about Burmese content. They were totally unprepared,"" he said. ""We had to translate it into English for them.""
'I DON'T KNOW THE LANGUAGE'
In August 2013, Zuckerberg announced a plan to make the internet available for the first time to billions of people in developing countries.
""Everything Facebook has done has been about giving all people around the world the power to connect,"" he said. The company would now work, he added, to make ""internet access available to those who cannot currently afford it.""
But in Myanmar, the language barrier would cause trouble. Most people here don't speak English. Although Myanmar users at the time could post on Facebook in Burmese, the platform's interface – including its system for reporting problematic posts – was in English.
Making matters worse, the company's operation for monitoring content in Burmese was meagre.
In 2014, the social media behemoth had just one content reviewer who spoke Burmese: a local contractor in Dublin, according to messages sent by Facebook employees in the private Facebook chat group. A second Burmese speaker began working in early 2015, the messages show.
In Manila – the original site of the outsourced Project Honey Badger – there were no content reviewers who spoke Burmese. People who reviewed Myanmar content there spoke English.
""In cases like hate speech where we didn't understand the language, we would say, 'I don't know the language,'"" said a person who worked there. ""So the client had to solve that,"" the person said, referring to Facebook.
By 2015, Facebook had around four Burmese speakers reviewing Myanmar content in Manila and Dublin. They were stretched thin: that year Facebook had 7.3 million active users in Myanmar.
Accenture slowly began to hire more Burmese speakers. With the help of volunteer translators, Facebook also introduced a Burmese-language interface.
By 2016, the Honey Badger project had moved to Kuala Lumpur after Accenture convinced Facebook it would be easier to recruit Burmese and others to work in Malaysia's capital than in further-off Manila, according to a person familiar with the matter.
In an office tower in Kuala Lumpur, teams of content monitors are assigned to handle different Asian countries, not just Myanmar. They are paid around $850 to $1000 a month and are often employed by temporary staffing agencies, according to ex-employees and online recruitment ads.
Facebook said in a statement: ""We've chosen to work only with highly reputable, global partners that take care of their employees, pay them well and provide robust benefits - this includes Accenture in Asia Pacific.""
A spokesperson for Accenture confirmed it partners with Facebook. ""The characterization of our operations as 'secretive' is misleading and confidentiality is in place primarily to protect the privacy and security of our people and the clients we serve,"" the spokesperson said.
THE COMMUNICATIONS MAN
Former content monitors said they often each had to make judgments on 1,000 or more potentially problematic content items a day, although the number is now understood to be less.
Facebook's complete rules about what is and isn't allowed on its platform are spelled out in its internal community standards enforcement guidelines, which the company made public for the first time in April. It defines hate speech as ""violent or dehumanising speech, statements of inferiority, or calls for exclusion or segregation"" against people based on their race, ethnicity, religious affiliation and other characteristics.
In response, Facebook said: ""Content reviewers aren't required to evaluate any set number of posts … We encourage reviewers to take the time they need.""
A Facebook official also told Reuters the community standards policy is global, ""but there are local nuances,"" such as slurs, that content reviewers who are native speakers can consider when making decisions. But former content monitors told Reuters the rules were inconsistent; sometimes they could make exceptions and sometimes they couldn't.
Former content monitors also said they were trained to err on the side of keeping content on Facebook. ""Most of the time, you try to give the user the benefit of the doubt,"" said one former Facebook employee.
The ex-monitors said they sometimes had as little as a few seconds to decide if a post constituted hate speech or violated Facebook's community standards in some other way. They said they didn't actually search for hate speech themselves; instead, they reviewed a giant queue of posts mostly reported by Facebook users.
Many of the millions of items flagged globally each week – including violent diatribes and lurid sexual imagery – are detected by automated systems, Facebook says. But a company official acknowledged to Reuters that its systems have difficulty interpreting Burmese script because of the way the fonts are often rendered on computer screens, making it difficult to identify racial slurs and other hate speech.
Facebook's troubles are evident in a new feature that allows users to translate Burmese content into English. Consider a post Reuters found from August of last year.
In Burmese, the post says: ""Kill all the kalars that you see in Myanmar; none of them should be left alive.""
Facebook's translation into English: ""I shouldn't have a rainbow in Myanmar.""
In response, Facebook said: ""Our translations team is actively working on new ways to ensure that translations are accurate."" The company said it uses a different system to detect hate speech.
Guy Rosen, vice president of product management, wrote in a blog post on Facebook in May about the problems the company faced in identifying hate speech. ""Our technology still doesn't work that well and so it needs to be checked by our review teams,"" he wrote.
Facebook officials say they have no immediate plans to hire any employees in Myanmar itself. But the company does contract with local agencies for tasks unrelated to content monitoring. One is Echo Myanmar, a communications firm whose managing director is Anthony Larmon, an American.
Larmon has expressed strong opinions on the Rohingya. Toward the end of 2016, the Myanmar army launched an onslaught across some 10 villages after Rohingya militants attacked border posts. At the time, a U.N. official accused the government of seeking ""ethnic cleansing"" of the Rohingya.
In November 2016, Larmon wrote that an article about the U.N. allegation was ""misleading."" He cited what he said were claims by multiple ""local journalists"" that the ethnic minority ""purposely exaggerate (lie about)"" their situation to ""get more foreign aid and attention.""
He also wrote: ""No, they aren't facing ethnic cleansing or anything remotely close to what that incendiary term suggests."" He said he later removed the post.
A Facebook spokesperson said that Larmon's post ""does not represent Facebook's view.""
Larmon told Reuters: ""It was overly-emotional, under-informed commentary on a highly nuanced subject that I do regret. My view on the Rohingya, same today as then, is that they should be safely repatriated and protected.""

The platform on which he aired his views about the Rohingya? Facebook.

1242,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>",Some Russian ships stop cargoes to Ukraine after tanker detained: sources,"By Natalia Chumakova and Natalia Zinets
MOSCOW/KIEV (Reuters) - Some Russian ships have stopped transporting cargo to Ukraine, deeming it risky after a Russian tanker was detained in a Ukrainian port as Kiev made good on sanctions against Moscow, two sources at shipowners said.
    It is the latest fallout from Russia's annexation of the Crimea peninsula in 2014 and the emergence of a pro-Moscow insurgency in eastern Ukraine.
    The Mekhanik Pogodin oil tanker, under the Russian flag, has been moored in the port of Kherson since Aug. 10, Reuters ship tracking data shows.
A spokeswoman for a regional unit of the Ukrainian state security service (SBU) said the tanker had been detained in the port and prevented from offloading because its owner is on a list of sanctions imposed by Kiev.
""We are just following the law, the presidential order, which has approved the (sanctions) list... I think this is the first (detention) of such kind,"" Veronika Frolova said.
The vessel is owned by VEB-Leasing, part of Russian banking group VEB and among Russian companies subject to sanctions imposed by Ukraine in May as a response to ""Russian aggression in Ukraine"".
The tanker was leased by V.F. Tanker to carry diesel from Turkmenistan to Ukraine on behalf of the Canadian company Oil Marine Shipping and Chartering Inc., the captain, Mikhail Zamyatin, said via a statement sent by V.F. Tanker, one of the largest shipping companies in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov region.
VEB-Leasing declined to comment. The Russian Ministry of Transport did not respond to a request for comment.
Reuters tracking data shows that some Russian vessels that are not subject to sanctions are still bound for Ukrainian ports. 
However, industry sources said that other Russian shipowners which are also not subject to sanctions have now stopped shipping to Ukraine for fear of losing their cargo.
    ""Of course we won't go to Ukraine, we have suspended the shipments for now. If needs be, we will be searching for other destinations,"" a shipping industry source told Reuters.
    SUNFLOWER TRADE
Ukraine's presidential office imposed sanctions on more than 700 mostly Russian companies, including VEB Leasing, in May. Those entities - including banks, transport, media and defense companies - were banned from doing trade in Ukraine and their assets in Ukraine would be seized, it said. 
    Many Russian companies have already sought to wind up their Ukraine-linked activities due to earlier sanctions since the Crimea conflict in 2014.
    Russian ships typically carry oil products from Turkmenistan via Russian ports and the Sea of Azov to the Ukrainian ports of Odessa, Kherson and Nikolayev during summer, partly by river.
    They also ship sunflower seed oil from Ukraine, and those operations have also been suspended, according to the sources.
    ""No one wants their ship to get stuck (in Ukrainian waters) with a cargo, which had been paid for,"" another source at a Russian shipping company said. 
V.F. Tanker, in its statement, said Mekhanik Pogodin's captain was still on the ship as the Kherson harbor master had barred the vessel from leaving the port. The harbor master declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
    Ukraine's coast guard detained a Russian fishing boat, Nord, in the Sea of Azov on March 25, accusing the crew of entering ""territory, which has been under a temporary occupation"". The crew was released, but the boat is still detained.

1247,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>",EU acting too slowly with Poland on court independence: top judge,"By Justyna Pawlak and Anna Wlodarczak-Semczuk
WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's top judge Malgorzata Gersdorf, who is locked in a dispute with the ruling party, has urged the European Union to move faster to defend her country's judiciary from government efforts to increase its influence over the courts.
The EU's executive Commission appears ""to have put faith"" in the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party's openness to negotiate, even as the government was ""playing for time"", she told Reuters in an interview.
Gersdorf, who is president of the Supreme Court, is at the centre of a dispute over the rule of law in Poland, the largest ex-communist state in the EU. She has defied PiS legislation to force her early retirement, insisting her constitutional term expires in 2020.
Last month, Polish President Andrzej Duda declared Gersdorf retired and she isn't hearing cases, but she is still working out of her office at the Supreme Court building and receiving a salary.
After months of on-and-off negotiations, the EU has launched a series of legal steps against Poland's rules on the Supreme Court and other judicial reforms that it believes contravene the bloc's democratic standards.
The government says the overhaul is needed to improve the efficiency of the courts and rid the country of a residue of communism, which collapsed in Poland almost 30 years ago. Further negotiations are due to take place with Brussels but so far Warsaw has offered only cosmetic concessions.
""What may happen is ... judges will be fired and (the government) will take a step back but it won't need to because the judges will be gone,"" said Gersdorf, adding that the EU is acting ""too late"".
PiS says everything it is doing is legitimate and backed by the majority of voters.
Sitting in a courtroom at the Supreme Court, Gersdorf, 65, said the EU was probably preoccupied with the rising tide of populism elsewhere in Europe to focus squarely on Poland.
She expressed hope that PiS - an economically left-leaning party with a nationalist agenda - would back down over the Supreme Court, but said she would walk away once a new chief was appointed constitutionally.
""We can't dig trenches here. (I will) have to leave with dignity,"" she said.
Gersdorf and judges' groups in Poland believe efforts to push her out of the Supreme Court, which validates general election results in Poland, are unconstitutional.
Through a series of hastily-approved laws, PiS has dismissed or replaced many judges from the Constitutional Tribunal and the National Judiciary Council, as well as heads of regular courts. 
Replacements have been appointed under revised procedures that give parliament more say.
Once new judges are brought into the Supreme Court, it will face significant difficulties in adjudicating cases for years because of their lack of experience or a lack of continuity in the judicial process, Gersdorf said.
A politicisation of Polish courts which the EU has warned about has yet to show its full impact on how the courts function, she said. 
However, some judges have already faced criticism from politicians over their decisions. In particular, Gersdorf pointed to a statement by the Supreme Court this month that its judges should continue working until the EU's court rules on the legality of measures that effectively allow the government to choose the court's staff.

""It's been said that (Supreme Court) judges ... should face disciplinary proceedings. This is very dangerous.""

CARACAS (Reuters) - At one of Caracas' biggest public hospitals, most bathrooms are closed. Patients fill jugs from a tiny tap on the ground floor that sometimes has a trickle of water. Operations are postponed or canceled.
The Central Venezuelan University hospital, once a Latin American leader, is reeling as taps run dry. 
""I have gone to the operation bloc and opened the tap to wash my hands, as you must do before a surgery, and nothing comes out,"" said gynecologist Lina Figueria. 
Water cuts are the latest addition to a long list of woes for Venezuelans hurting from a fifth year of an economic crisis that has sparked malnutrition, hyperinflation and emigration.
Malfunctions in the capital's water network due to lack of maintenance have taken a turn for the worst in recent months, depriving many in this city of 3 million people of regular running water. 
Caracas is nestled in a verdant valley perched at around 900 meters (2,953 feet) and its water is pumped from much lower sources. But the pumps have not been maintained, spare parts are scarce and President Nicolas Maduro's administration is short of cash.
""For many years this deterioration process was not noticeable. But now the water transport systems are very damaged,"" said Jose De Viana, former president of Hidrocapital, the state-run utility in charge of Caracas' water supply. 
Venezuela's socialist government typically says water cuts are due to sabotage by right-wing ""terrorists.""
Information Minister Jorge Rodriguez in July announced a ""special plan"" to fix the issues, but did not provide details. The Information Ministry and Hidrocapital did not respond to a request for information. 
Lack of water - and taps that sometimes spurt out brown liquid - have triggered health concerns in a country lacking basic antibiotics and vaccines.
About 75 percent of Caracas residents said they do not receive water regularly, according to a survey published by two Venezuelan non-governmental organizations this month. Around 11 percent said they thought dirty water had caused skin and stomach problems. The survey does not have comparative figures. 
Medical consequences are hard to gauge as the Health Ministry no longer releases once-weekly data, but doctors say scabies and diarrhea are on the rise.
Water shortages have also made some basic daily activities untenable. Poor residents say they take fewer showers. 
In the low-income neighborhood of Catia, university professor Mariangela Gonzalez, 64, has 127 bottles, gas containers and pots clogging the entrance to her house.

""When the water comes on, we have to run,"" said Gonzalez.

Plans to increase the number of Marines in Norway to 700 from 330 and moving some of them closer to the border with Russia had triggered a sharp reaction from Moscow, which called the plans ""clearly unfriendly"".
The government in Oslo, increasingly concerned about Russia since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, insists the increased U.S. presence is only for training purposes and should not be interpreted as a military escalation.
The Marines had been scheduled to leave Norway at the end of this year after an initial contingent arrived in 2017 to train for fighting in winter conditions. They are the first foreign troops stationed in Norway since World War Two.
Foreign Minister Ine Eriksen Soereide has previously told reporters the decision did not constitute establishing a permanent U.S. base in Norway and did not target Russia.
The rotation of forces will last for up to five years compared with an initial posting that ran for six months from the start of 2017, and then was extended last June.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A staunch ally of cricketer-turned politician Imran Khan was elected speaker of Pakistan's lower house on Wednesday, a key position to support Khan's legislative agenda after he won a disputed election last month.
Asad Qaiser, a Khan loyalist, defeated Pakistan Peoples Party candidate Syed Khurshid Shah, who was backed by lawmakers from the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) that held power last term. Qaiser won by 176 votes to 146.
Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party won 116 of the 272 elected seats in the National Assembly, which is expected to vote in the former sportsman as prime minister on Friday.
A swearing-in ceremony is scheduled for Saturday.
""Mr. Asad Qaiser has been declared to have been elected as speaker of the national assembly of Pakistan,"" said outgoing speaker Ayaz Sadiq.
Qaiser previously served as the speaker of the provincial assembly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa from 2013 to 2018. He was elected to the National Assembly for the first time in last month's polls. 
In a raucous ceremony, protesting PML-N lawmakers shouted ""give honor to the vote"" after Qaiser was announced as the new speaker.
They also chanted the name of PML-N founder Nawaz Sharif, who was ousted from office in 2017 and who was jailed ahead of the July polls.
The PML-N and PPP, two parties which have dominated Pakistan's politics for decades, have both called into question the fairness of last month's election, citing irregularities after polls closed. 
They also allege Khan's PTI path to power was enabled by clandestine assistance from Pakistan's powerful military, which has ruled Pakistan for about half its history since independence in 1947. The army denies playing a role in the elections.
Following the elections, the PPP and PML-N said they would join forces to field Sharif's brother and PML-N leader Shehbaz Sharif as their candidate for prime minister in parliament but the alliance, which includes several smaller parties, is unlikely to derail Khan's election.

KOCHI, India (Reuters) - The death toll from the worst floods in nearly a century in the Indian tourist state of Kerala rose to 43 on Wednesday as rising water stranded tens of thousands of people and forced the closure of one of its main airports.
The five latest fatalities from the rain that began a week ago came when authorities in the southern state were forced to release water from 35 dangerously full dams, sending a surge into its main river.
""Presently, 35 reservoirs in the state are releasing water. Many districts in the state are facing floods,"" the state's chief minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, said on Twitter.
The Indian Meteorological Department has forecast heavy to very heavy rain in the state until Saturday, and it has issued a ""red alert"" for 12 out of its 14 districts. 
The airport in the port city of Kochi will stay shut until Saturday afternoon.
The rain and floods have destroyed and damaged hundreds of houses in the past week and caused significant losses to crops in the state known for its spices and coffee.
A senior official with the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority, Sekhar Lukose Kuriakose, said the seasonal rains have killed more than 200 people in the state since May and displaced many.
The state last saw such devastating flooding in 1924.

Famous for its coastline and picturesque backwaters, Kerala has become a major destination for domestic and international tourists.

1252,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 07:00AM ET</span>",Can Britain alone stop Brexit? Scottish court hears appeal,"EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Pro-EU campaigners seeking to establish legally that Britain alone could stop the Brexit process took an appeal to Scotland's top court on Wednesday.
They want judges to ask the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to clarify whether Britain could choose to remain in the world's biggest trading bloc without permission from the other 27 members. That would require Britain's parliament to first decide that the final Brexit deal, if and when it is reached, was not good enough.
The case is of renewed relevance as Britain's Conservative government works against the clock to reach agreement with Brussels on the terms of its departure ahead of the March 2019 departure date.
The possibility of Brexit happening without an agreement has pummeled the value of sterling on foreign exchange markets, and the government says it has stepped up planning for that possibility.
The Edinburgh Court of Session hearing, backed by British and Scottish lawmakers, is an appeal against a June ruling. Judges then said they could not refer the matter to the ECJ because Britain had not decided to overturn Brexit, and the case was therefore hypothetical.
The Scottish court's decision, which can be appealed at Britain's Supreme Court in London, will be announced in the coming weeks, a court spokesman said.
Knowing whether Article 50, the part of the European Treaty which triggers a member state leaving, can be reversed is essential to keeping Britain's options open, said Jo Maugham, a lawyer supporting this and other legal challenges to Brexit.
""This case - if it succeeds - means that when parliament looks again it will know whether we can just withdraw the Article 50 notice and keep all the opt-outs we presently enjoy,"" he said. 
""(We) will have the option of treating Brexit as just a bad dream.""
The British government has argued that the question of whether Britain could unilaterally stop Brexit is irrelevant because the will of the voters was made clear in the 2016 referendum and ministers will not reverse the decision.
However, with increasing worries that Brussels and London will not reach a deal in time, a recent poll found 45 percent of voters supported holding a new referendum whatever the outcome of talks with the EU, while 34 percent opposed it.

Prime Minister Theresa May has repeatedly ruled out another vote on Brexit, saying the public made their decision when they voted 51.9 percent to leave and 48.1 percent to stay in 2016.

The Jacksonville-based university said on Tuesday it had determined after ""careful consideration"" that the Confucius Institute, which opened a branch there in 2014 to promote language and culture, did not meet the university's mission. 
""After reviewing the classes, activities and events sponsored over the past four years and comparing them with the mission and goals of the university, it was determined that they weren't aligned,"" the university said in a statement.
It did not elaborate on the reasons for ending the partnership, but said the institute would be closed in February, fulfilling a legal obligations to provide six months' notice for ending the contract.
The Confucius Institute headquarters in Beijing and China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The ministry has in the past said the institute is aimed at increasing mutual understanding, and it has urged anyone suspicious of its programs to abandon their ""outmoded ideas"". 
Florida Senator Marco Rubio welcomed the university's decision.
Rubio has been among U.S. lawmakers warning that the Confucius Institute was an effort by China to expand its political influence abroad and had contributed to censorship on U.S. campuses.
""I welcome the decision of @UofNorthFlorida to close its Confucius Institute. There is growing & well-founded concern about these Chinese Communist Party-funded Institutes. I continue to urge other FL universities to follow suit,"" Rubio said on Twitter.
Rubio and other lawmakers have pursued legislation that would require universities to disclose major gifts from foreign sources, at a time when U.S. politicians, including President Donald Trump, but also many Democrats, have been pushing a harder line in dealing with China.
U.S.-China relations have suffered in recent months, with the two countries locked in an increasingly bitter trade dispute.
Several other universities in Florida still host the Confucius Institute, among more than 100 such centers around the United States.
Other major U.S. colleges, including Pennsylvania State University and the University of Chicago, have cut ties with the institute after professors complained its programs were Chinese propaganda wrapped in culture and language education.

The first election since Robert Mugabe was forced to resign after a coup in November had been expected to end Zimbabwe's pariah status and launch an economic recovery but post-election unrest has brought back uncomfortable reminders of its violent past.
Mnangagwa has urged Zimbabwe to unite behind him but questions remain over the death of six people in an army crackdown on protests against the ruling party's victory.
Chamisa has said the vote was rigged and has challenged the result by the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission, which gave Mnangagwa 2.46 million votes against 2.15 million votes for the 40-year-old Movement for Democratic Change leader.
Paul Mangwana, the ruling party's legal affairs secretary and one of Mnangagwa's lawyers said Chamisa would now be required to respond to Mnangagwa's application before the matter is set down for a hearing.
""We have successfully filed our opposition papers to this application, which we think is just a waste of time but that's for the courts to decide,"" Mangwana told reporters outside the Constitutional Court. 
""Our team of legal practitioners is ready to meet the MDC Alliance in court,"" he said.
Another of Mnangagwa's lawyers, Lewis Uriri told the official Herald newspaper's online edition that he had asked the court to dismiss Chamisa's application, which he said had missed a 10 a.m. (0800 GMT) deadline last Friday.
A lawyer representing Chamisa said he could not comment because he had not yet been served with Mnangagwa's papers.
The constitution requires a losing presidential candidate to file any challenge within seven days of a winner being declared.
The Constitutional Court, whose decision is final, can uphold the result, declare a new winner, order a fresh election within 60 days or make any other ruling it deems fit.
The court must rule within 14 days of an election challenge being lodged. The days do not include weekends and public holidays according to the court rules.

GAZA (Reuters) - Israel allowed commercial goods back into the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, in a sign of an easing of tensions as neighboring Egypt pursued a long-term ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the Palestinian enclave's dominant armed faction.
But the prospect of an agreement between Israel and the Islamist group prompted concern within Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing government that Hamas would take advantage of any respite from fighting to build up its rocket arsenal.
At Israel's Kerem Shalom commercial crossing with Gaza, consignments of fruits and vegetables, fuel and construction material moved into the territory of two million people on Wednesday morning, a Reuters camera crew said.
Israel announced on Tuesday it would lift the commercial goods ban it imposed on July 9 in response to the launching by Palestinians of incendiary balloons across the frontier.
There have been fewer reports in recent days of such incidents, which have burned large tracts of agricultural land and forests in southern Israel.
Israel also expanded Gaza's fishing zone, in waters under Israeli naval blockade, from 3 to 9 nautical miles off the southern coast and to six nautical miles in the north, the head of Gaza's fishermen's union said.
The Oslo interim peace accords in the early 1990s set a 20 nautical mile limit, which was never implemented. Since then the zone has ranged in size between 3 and 6 nautical miles.
""We are hoping for a big catch at nine miles now,"" said Khader Baker, 25, who owns two fishing boats. ""There had been almost no fish within three miles. We nearly starved.""
Prior restrictions on the import of commercial goods that Israel says could also be used for military purposes remained in effect, a Palestinian border official said. He said they included balloons and tires.
COMPREHENSIVE TRUCE
Egypt and the United Nations have been trying to broker a comprehensive truce to prevent more fighting and to ease the deep economic hardship in Gaza.
Hamas officials said Palestinian factions were in Cairo to discuss terms for a ceasefire with Israel, whose security cabinet convened on Wednesday to consider the issue.
Israeli Education Minister Naftali Bennett, who heads the ultranationalist Jewish Home party in the governing coalition, put Netanyahu on notice that his faction would vote against an agreement with Hamas.
""This 'quiet' will give Hamas total immunity so that it can rearm itself with tens of thousands of rockets,"" Bennett said in a statement.
For more than a decade Gaza has been controlled by Hamas and subject to an Israeli-Egyptian blockade that has wrecked its economy, creating what the World Bank has described as a humanitarian crisis with shortages of water, electricity and medicine.

Israel says it has no choice but to enforce its blockade to defend itself against Hamas, a group that has called for its destruction.

KABUL (Reuters) - A Taliban attack on a military outpost in Afghanistan's northern province of Baghlan on Wednesday killed up to 44 Afghan police and soldiers, provincial officials said, as the insurgents kept up pressure on government forces.
The attack, which came as the central city of Ghazni struggles to recover from five days of intense fighting, underlined how hard the insurgents have been pressuring badly stretched local security forces.
The defence ministry confirmed the incident early on Wednesday, but gave no details. Officials in the area said nine police and 35 soldiers were killed in the latest attack of a series that has killed dozens of security forces nationwide.
A Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, said the group targeted a military base and two checkposts in Baghlan, killing 70 Afghan security forces, and seizing armoured vehicles and ammunition.
The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan called for the fighting to stop, saying up to 150 civilians are estimated to have been killed in Ghazni, where the public hospital was overwhelmed and water and electricity supplies cut.
""The extreme human suffering caused by the fighting in Ghazni highlights the urgent need for the war in Afghanistan to end,"" the top U.N. official in Afghanistan, Tadamichi Yamamoto, said in a statement.
The International Committee of the Red Cross said it was providing dressing packages and oral and intravenous medicine to treat the wounded, along with electricity generators and fresh water for about 18,000 people.
The Taliban, who launched their Ghazni assault early on Friday and battled Afghan forces backed by U.S. air strikes in the middle of the city for days, said their fighters were pulled out to prevent further destruction. 
""They were facing severe shortages of food and drinking water as the power supply was also suspended two days ago,"" a Taliban commander, who declined to be identified, said by telephone.
The Ghazni attack, one of the Taliban's most devastating in years, has left questions over hopes for peace talks aroused by an unprecedented ceasefire during the Eid celebration in June and a meeting last month between Taliban officials and a senior U.S. diplomat.
Two senior Taliban leaders told Reuters this week the group was considering announcing a ceasefire for the feast of Eid-al Adha, which begins next week, but the future of any peace process remained uncertain.
In the southern province of Zabul, Taliban insurgents clashed with soldiers on Tuesday, forcing the government to send reinforcements from neighbouring provinces to retain control of two checkposts. 
The clashes killed 11 soldiers and one policeman, with three soldiers wounded, said Haji Atta Jan Haqbayan, a Zabul provincial council member.

Separately, six girls younger than 10 were killed when an unexploded mortar they picked up to play with suddenly went off on Wednesday, officials in the eastern province of Laghman said.

Skilled labor shortages and a lack of young people willing to start on-the-job training for up to 3-1/2 years have become the biggest concerns for managers in Europe's largest economy.
The number of vacancies for training positions has reached its highest for more than 20 years as more than a third of companies can not fill all of their training places, according to business surveys.
However, the arrival of more than 1 million asylum seekers in Germany since 2015 has helped to ease the problem slightly, data from the Federal Statistics Office showed on Wednesday.
The number of new trainees with no German citizenship rose by 10,500, helping to lift the overall number of new vocational training contracts by 5,700 to 515,700 in 2017, the data showed.
Interest in vocational training was particularly strong among young men from Afghanistan and Syria as their number among the new apprentices more than tripled, the office said.
Without the applications from Syrians and Afghans, German companies would have ended up with fewer new trainees.
Germany's dual-track training system, which also includes theory lessons at vocational schools, is being exported in various forms to Europe, Asia, Africa and the United States. But its popularity is waning at home as young people increasingly prefer the higher status of a university degree.
That could hurt growth in Europe's biggest economy by exacerbating a skilled labor shortage, which is partly caused by hundreds of thousands of ageing employees leaving the labor market every year.

The statistics office said that the number of dropouts in vocational training fell slightly last year as roughly 146,000 training contracts were terminated prematurely.

The clouds carried little rain and offered little chance of a break from the bone-dry conditions plaguing the region, the National Weather Service said.
""Initial attack resources could be overwhelmed,"" it added in a red flag announcement. 
Elsewhere, crews made slow but steady progress against wildfires including one, called the Mendocino Complex, which has become largest in California's history and killed one firefighter from Utah on Monday.
Emergency crews had managed to set up containment lines around almost two thirds the fire which has raged through the southern end of the Mendocino National Forest, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said. 
That fire has scorched 355,000 acres (144,000 hectares) and destroyed 265 structures, it added.
To the northeast, firefighters have been able to carve containment lines around 65 percent of the Carr Fire, which has killed three firefighters, four civilians and a utility worker and burned more than 1,500 structures. The Carr Fire has blackening 211,000 acres, Cal Fire said. 
The heart of Yosemite National Park in California was reopened to the public on Tuesday after it was shut down for nearly three weeks due to the Ferguson Fire, which has caused two deaths. But smoke lingered in the air and a key route to the park's best known landmarks remained closed.

Evangelical pastor Andrew Brunson is standing trial in Turkey over terrorism charges. His case now lies at the heart of a diplomatic crisis between Turkey and the United States that has sent Turkish lira into free-fall.
It usually takes a court between 3 to 7 days to process an appeal but a ruling could come sooner in this case, Brunson's lawyer Ismail Cem Halavurt told Reuters.
""A ruling can come tomorrow, or even tonight. These are appeals that require fast decision making because they are related to an individual's freedoms,"" he said.
A previous appeal by Halavurt on behalf of Brunson was rejected by the court.
The case now lies at the heart of a bitter row between NATO allies Turkey and United States, who have been growing apart for years over a series of disagreements on Syria, their perception of security threats and defense deals.
The evangelical pastor is accused of terrorism charges and aiding the network of a U.S.-based Islamic preacher blamed by Ankara for masterminding a coup attempt in July 2016 against Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his vice president Mike Pence have repeatedly called for the pastor's release and have sanctioned two Turkish ministers after a Turkish court moved him to house arrest after 21 months in prison. Washington said the move was inadequate.
Last week Trump said he was doubling tariffs on metal imports. Ankara retaliated on Wednesday by doubling tariffs on some U.S. imports including cars, alcohol and tobacco.

Brunson faces up to 35 years in prison if found guilty. He has denied the charges. His next trial hearing is scheduled for October 12.

TAOS, N.M. (Reuters) - A New Mexico judge received death threats and Islamophobic abuse on Tuesday a day after she granted bail to five Muslims charged with child abuse and accused of training children at their compound to carry out attacks, court officials said.
Police raided the compound in Taos County on Aug. 3 following a tip-off that children held there were starving. They found 11 children in need of food and water, and three days later unearthed the body of a toddler.
In an order published on Tuesday, district Judge Sarah Backus said prosecutors had produced evidence that was ""troubling and unusual"" but failed to show the defendants abused the children and were a threat to society if released on bail.
One caller on Tuesday told Backus ""her throat would be slit"" while another said he wished ""someone would smash her head,"" New Mexico courts spokesman Barry Massey said. 
Backus was bombarded with abuse and criticism on Twitter, and received hundreds of calls and emails, most of which referred to her using terms like ""Islamic terrorism sympathizer"", Massey said.
Backus closed her court and the Taos County courthouse went into lockdown after threats of violence against all staff.
Prosecutors alleged the dead toddler was a severely ill boy abducted from Georgia by his father, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, the son of a prominent New York imam. Prosecutors said the boy died at the compound in February as Ibn Wahhaj tried to heal him through prayer.
Prosecutors allege Wahhaj gave firearms training to two teenage boys at the compound to attack ""corrupt institutions.""
New Mexico's Republican Governor Susana Martinez slammed Backus' bail decision in a statement, saying the state's Supreme Court had been ""dictating pretrial release for all kinds of dangerous criminals.""
The five defendants - two men, their wives and a sister - must wear GPS ankle bracelets once released on $20,000 bail each and are not allowed back to the compound, Backus ruled.
DIVIDED COMMUNITY
Their 11 children are in protective care and the defendants may visit them once released, Backus said. 
The case has split the Taos County community between those who believe the group was involved in a failed attempt to live ""off the grid,"" and others who fear they were hatching a plot to attack schools, banks and police, as prosecutors alleged.
""There's a murderer in the bunch,"" said Larry Salazar, 67, a rancher who lives about 2 miles from the high-desert compound. ""What are we going to do to protect ourselves? Where are they going to be going to?"".
Another resident, named Quincy, who requested his full name not be used, said he didn't think the defendants were dangerous, ""especially when they came in here using their real names and introduced themselves to every possible person who was their neighbor."" 
Ibn Wahhaj has not entered a plea but the other four adults have plead not guilty. Wahhaj must remain in custody as he still faces a Georgia arrest warrant for the abduction of his son.

""Such contacts are indeed planned and being prepared,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call on Wednesday. Peskov did not elaborate further. 
U.S. President Donald Trump faced criticism at home after he met Vladimir Putin in the Finnish capital in July, and refused to blame the Russian leader for meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.
A new round of U.S. sanctions targeting Russia was announced in the wake of that criticism, prompting the Russian rouble to fall sharply. 
Last week, Rand Paul, a Republican senator and Trump ally, traveled to the Russian capital, saying his trip aimed to encourage diplomacy amid the tense relations between Moscow and Washington. 

Washington had said on Tuesday Bolton would meet Russian officials as a follow-up to the Helsinki summit.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and all major political parties on Wednesday condemned a speech by a minor senator who used the term ""final solution"" in calling for a revival of a ""White Australia"" restrictive immigration policy.
In one of the most divisive speeches seen in parliament since 1996 when far-right politician Pauline Hanson declared incorrectly that Australia was being swamped by Asians, Senator Fraser Anning on Tuesday called for a national vote on whether to ban Muslim migration.
Anning said Muslims were responsible for acts of terror and crime and were dependant on welfare. Muslims account for less than three percent of Australia's population, census data shows.
Amid national outrage Turnbull, who will head to the polls within nine months, quickly condemned Anning.
""We reject, we condemn racism in any form, and the remarks by Senator Anning are justly condemned and rejected by us all,"" Turnbull told Australia's parliament. 
Opposition Labor party leader Bill Shorten told parliament on Wednesday: ""You have to be pretty outrageous to be condemned by everybody in the Australian parliament, but Senator Anning has managed to do just this"".
Australians will return to the polls by May 2019, and recent polls show the majority of the electorate back multiculturalism, but far-right politicians are expected to pose a challenge to the mainstream parties.
""Turnbull can and must bat this away,"" said Haydon Manning, a political science professor at Flinders University in South Australia.
Anning, who has been in parliament for less than a year has entered into a lose alliance with several conservative independent lawmakers that has boosted his otherwise inconsequential role in Australia's upper house.
Anning split from Hanson's One Nation party shortly after being sworn in, though his speech had many of the hallmarks of his former leader who has called for cuts to Asian and Muslim immigration.
""The final solution to the immigration problem, of course, is a popular vote,"" Anning told parliament in his maiden speech.
The Final Solution or the Final Solution to the Jewish Question was a Nazi plan for the genocide or extermination of the Jews during World War Two. Anning has since said he did not know the history of the phrase.
Hanson joined the condemnation, telling the Senate she was appalled by Anning's speech.
""We are a multi-racial society and I have always advocated you do not have to be white to be Australian,"" she said.

Under what was commonly called a ""White Australia"" policy Australia restricted non-European immigration from 1901 until the late 1960s using various laws.

The abbot of Longquan Temple on the outskirts of Beijing, who is also a member of the Communist Party's top political advisory body, has denied accusations of harassing and demanding sexual favors from several nuns.
The Buddhist Association of China said in a statement on its website that it had accepted Master Xuecheng's offer to resign from the chairmanship and other posts on Wednesday, without elaborating on the reasons.
China's religious affairs administration launched an investigation following accusations leveled against the abbot in a document prepared by two former monks at the monastery.
Xuecheng issued a denial on his Weibo microblog account, saying the allegations stemmed from ""fabricated material"" and ""distorted facts"". 
The case is one of the most prominent to have arisen since the #MeToo movement began to gain momentum in China.

The Chinese #MeToo-style movement came in December last year and the hashtag #MeToo has so far appeared more than millions of times on Weibo, and while issues like sexual assault have traditionally been brushed under the carpet, the movement is changing mindset among the younger generation.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A third summit of Korean leaders planned for next month will be a further step toward denuclearization of the peninsula and a peace treaty to end the Korean War, South Korea's President Moon Jae-in said on Wednesday.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to work toward denuclearization at a landmark summit in Singapore with U.S. President Donald Trump in June, but the two countries have since struggled to agree on how to reach that goal.
Advancement in ties between North and South Korea is the ""driving force"" behind denuclearisation, Moon said in a speech, lauding Monday's pact for next month's summit in Pyongyang, the North's capital.
The two leaders will ""take an audacious step to proceed toward the declaration of an end to the Korean War and the signing of a peace treaty as well as the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,"" Moon added.
The neighbors remain technically in a state of war since the Korean War of 1950 to 1953 ended in a truce rather than a peace treaty.
Moon said he hoped for speedy progress in talks between the United States and North Korea, with steps by Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear programs matched by ""corresponding comprehensive measures"" from Washington. 
""When the deep-rooted distrust between the two Koreas and between the North and the United States is lifted, the mutual agreement can be implemented,"" he said on the peninsula's 73rd anniversary of liberation from Japanese rule, which lasted from 1910 to 1945. 
During their first summit in April, Moon and Kim had agreed to push for an end to the Korean War together with the United States this year, but Washington has said its focus is on denuclearisation, although Trump in Singapore had promised security guarantees for the North. 
""When peace is established on the Korean peninsula along with complete denuclearisation, economic cooperation can be carried out in earnest,"" Moon said. 
Plans to build a railway across the peninsula will kick off this year, he added, proposing an East Asian railroad community that groups China, Japan, Mongolia, Russia and the United States. 
Moon seeks to resume business cooperation with the North, including the railroad and a joint industrial park, but has been cautious because of international sanctions, chiefly spearheaded by Washington, over Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.
Moon said he aimed for ""unification economic zones"" along border provinces when military tension eases and there is lasting peace.

He estimated cross-border economic cooperation could be worth at least 170 trillion won ($149.9 billion) over the next 30 years, citing a study by a state-run think tank.

Japan's Meteorological Agency said that volcanic earthquakes and sulfur emissions had increased at a peak on Kuchinoerabujima island, located roughly 1,000 km (621 miles) southwest of Tokyo, and raised its warning level to 4 out of 5.
The mountain erupted explosively three years ago, sending ash and smoke thousands of meters into the sky and releasing potentially deadly pyroclastic flows, flows of super-heated ash and gas, that reached the sea.
At that time, the island's entire population evacuated but eventually returned. Some 100 people live there at present.
Japan has 110 active volcanoes and monitors 47 constantly. When 63 people were killed in the volcanic eruption of Mount Ontake in September 2014, it was the country's worst such toll for nearly 90 years.
In January, a member of Japan's military was struck and killed when rocks from a volcanic eruption rained down on skiers at a central mountain resort.

SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - When Shen Mengyu graduated with a master's degree from a top Chinese university in 2015, she could have landed a comfortable job in government or at one of China's internet giants.
Instead, she went to work at a car parts factory in the southern city of Guangzhou, pursuing her interest in labor activism. 
In May, she was fired for organizing workers at the plant. Undeterred, she began advocating for workers trying to form an autonomous trade union at Jasic International, a welding machinery exporter in nearby Shenzhen.
Shen is part of a cohort of activists across China who have been supporting and publicizing worker protests and detentions at a time of slowing economic growth. 
The activists include students and recent graduates, as well as retired factory workers and Communist Party members.
While they appear to be small in number, the activists are drawing rare attention to calls for greater union representation from Chinese workers, particularly in the south, where demands for more pay are growing.
This unrest poses a challenge for the ruling Communist Party, which opposes independent labor action and punishes protesters. It also views the activists as a threat to its authority. 
Shen told Reuters last week she believed the authorities had been intimidating her parents to get her to stop her activism.
On Saturday night, after dining with her parents near the Jasic factory, Shen was bundled into a car by three unidentified men, two student activists from Peking University who were at the scene told Reuters.
""Mengyu was shouting 'What are you doing? Let me go, let me go',"" one of the activists said. ""Everything happened so quickly, we ran to get help and by the time we came back she and the car had disappeared.""
The students said they reported the abduction to the police, who doubted their account and refused to take down crucial parts of their statement. They were also told that video cameras at the location of the incident were broken.
Calls to Shen and the police went unanswered on Monday.
Local police said on their official social media account Monday that they had been in contact with Shen's parents.
""This is a matter regarding a family dispute, it is not a kidnapping,"" it said, without further explanation. Reuters was unable to reach Shen's parents.
WORKER PROTESTS
Protests at the Jasic factory broke out in early July after seven workers attempting to form a union and elect their own leaders were laid off. On July 27, after two weeks of protests, the police detained 29 people, including laid-off workers, their families and supporters. 
Hundreds of Chinese university students penned open letters on social media in support of the workers, and around 20 traveled to Shenzhen, in Guangdong province.
Unions in China have to register with the official All-China Federation of Trade Unions. Rights groups, however, say the federation is often more responsive to the demands of management than workers.
On August 6, around fifty student activists and supporters of the Jasic workers protested outside the police station where the workers were detained in Shenzhen. 
""Lots of fellow students say: this incident is about workers, what does this have to do with students? I'll tell them one thing: today's students are tomorrow's workers,"" said Yue Xin, 22, a recent graduate of Peking University, in a video from the protest she shared online.
Yue, currently a factory worker in southern China, gained prominence in April for pressing her university to make public an investigation into a decades-old rape and suicide case.
The people who traveled to Shenzhen have been facing pressure from their universities, parents and officials, according to nine activists interviewed by Reuters. 
""My university advisor has called me repeatedly, accusing me of being involved in illegal activities, "" said one activist from a Guangdong university. The activist said he had been told ""to think very carefully about what I was doing and how it might impact my studies and my future.""
Some supporters were intercepted on their way to Shenzhen and sent home, the students said.
In interviews, some activists said they were motivated by growing inequality in China, and heard about worker protests in online forums before posts were removed by authorities. 
They said they were also exposed to labor issues at student-run university clubs and reading groups.
""Both my parents are factory workers so I have always had an interest in labor rights,"" said one of the activists who saw Shen taken away.
The students often speak the same language of Marxist theory and egalitarianism used by the Communist Party, yet have found themselves at odds with the authorities.
Last November, a Peking University graduate, Zhang Yunfan, was detained in Guangzhou after founding a reading group focused on improving the plight of factory workers.
In an online statement on July 29, Jasic denied mistreating workers or blocking their union. It said it fired some workers in accordance with the law and that a union was being established. Jasic did not respond to a faxed request for further comment.
Shenzhen police said a group of former Jasic workers who illegally entered the factory were being held for investigation. The Shenzhen ministry of public security and the detention center where the workers are being held did not respond to faxed requests for comment.
ACTIVISTS HARASSED
The authorities have been keeping close tabs on the factory workers, students and other supporters, according to interviews and eyewitness accounts.
The students - who are renting accommodation near the Jasic factory – say they have had to move three times, as police pressure landlords to evict them. 
People who appeared to be plain clothes police were keeping a close eye on the building where the activists were staying during a recent visit by Reuters.
The activists said police had also set up a fake factory recruitment stand outside the building and infiltrated into the group a mole posing as a former factory worker. The activists' claims could not be verified by Reuters.
The factory workers and their supporters communicated with Reuters through multiple phone numbers and WeChat accounts that were continuously shut down.
China does not publish official statistics on numbers of worker protests and strikes. 
DIRE CONDITIONS
Former workers at Jasic, which employs more than 1,000 people, say conditions in the company's factory are dire.
""Sometimes we would work for one month straight without any time off,"" said Huang Lanfeng, 25, a former Jasic employee who was detained for protesting. ""They wouldn't let us freely quit and they even watched us go to the toilet."" 
She added: ""I've worked at a lot of factories and none were as bad as Jasic.""
Geoffrey Crothall, communications director at the Kong Kong-based China Labour Bulletin, said the protests could resonate at other factories.
""It certainly has the potential to be replicated if the workers from another factory are similarly motivated and well organized,"" he said.
The Communist Party has pushed for unions to better protect workers, but the efforts were ""superficial"", he said. 
""It really does impinge on the party's legitimacy.""
HARSH TREATMENT
As of Sunday, 15 of the detained workers and supporters had been freed. Four detainees told Reuters they were treated harshly in detention, with police threatening them with death and saying they would not be released unless they confessed.
The workers' accounts jibe with stories from detained advocates in other incidents and follow an established pattern of Chinese police interrogation, according to Patrick Poon, a Hong Kong-based researcher at Amnesty International.
The detentions have become an even greater rallying cry for the activists.

""What started out as a labor dispute turned into unfair dismissals and police abuse which has galvanized supporters from both around the country and around the world,"" Shen told Reuters on August 6, before she was taken away in the car.

Duterte said he hoped China would ""temper"" its behavior and stop restricting movements, which could lead to a confrontation, possibly with treaty ally the United States. The Philippines was close enough to be put in danger, he said. 
China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam and Brunei have competing claims to the Spratly archipelago, where China has rapidly turned reefs into artificial islands that appear to be military installations, from which its personnel routinely instructs foreign vessels to leave.
""They have to rethink that because that would be a flashpoint someday,"" Duterte said in a speech late on Tuesday.
""You cannot create an island. It's man-made and you say that the air above this artificial island is yours. That is wrong because those waters are what we would consider international sea. And the right of innocent passage is guaranteed,"" he said.
China's Foreign Ministry did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
Duterte has a policy of engagement with Beijing, in the hope of securing billions of dollars in grants, loans and investments, and has rejected criticism that he is acquiescing to Chinese pressure or surrendering Philippines sovereignty.

However, instead of blaming China for building and militarising islands in disputed waters, he has said the United States was at fault for not blocking the construction when it started.

Past visits by Japanese leaders to Yasukuni have outraged China and South Korea because the shrine honors 14 Japanese wartime leaders convicted as war criminals by an Allied tribunal, along with war dead. 
Ruling Liberal Democratic Party lawmaker Masahiko Shibayama, who made the offering on Abe's behalf, said the prime minister asked him to pray for the souls of the departed and that Abe regretted being unable to pay his respects in person.
Abe has only visited the shrine in person once since taking office in 2012 but has previously sent offerings.
China's relations with Japan have long been haunted by what Beijing sees as Tokyo's failure to atone for its occupation of parts of China before and during World War Two, although ties have thawed somewhat recently. Japan occupied Korea from 1910-1945 and bitter memories still rankle.
Abe was due to speak at a separate annual memorial ceremony for war dead later on Wednesday that will also be attended by Emperor Akihito - the last time he will take part in the event before abdicating next year.
Akihito, 84, has carved out an active role as a symbol of peace, democracy and reconciliation during his three decades on the throne, visiting wartime battlefields to pray for the war dead of all nationalities.
Akihito expressed ""deep remorse"" over the war on the 70th anniversary of Japan's defeat in 2015. That departure from his annual script - repeated on subsequent anniversaries - was seen by many liberals and moderate conservatives as a subtle rebuke to the conservative Abe, who has said future generations of Japanese should not have to keep apologizing for the conflict.

Akihito's father, Emperor Hirohito, in whose name Japanese fought World War Two, stopped visiting Yasukuni after the wartime leaders were first honored by the shrine in 1978, and Akihito does not pay his respects there.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand school teachers went on strike on Wednesday for the first time in more than 20 years, challenging the Labour government's plans to balance promised fiscal responsibility against growing demands to increase public sector salaries. 
The government's first budget in May was stretched to fulfil its promise to juggle investing in much-needed infrastructure with a self-imposed rule to pay down debt and insulate the economy from potential shocks. 
Almost 30,000 primary school teachers did not turn up to work on Wednesday and held protests across the country, leaving parents of children aged 5 to 13 at public schools scrambling to find childcare.
""Teachers and principals voted for a full day strike...to send a strong message to the Government that the current collective agreement offers from the Ministry of Education would not fix the crisis in teaching,"" said Louise Green, lead negotiator at NZEI, the union that represents teachers, in a statement. 
NZEI said it has asked for a 16 percent pay increase for teachers over two years, whereas the government has offered between 6.1 and 14.7 percent payrises, depending on experience, over three years.
""Our view is that we need to have those discussions around the negotiating table but...there isn't an endless amount that we have available to us in order to meet those expectations,"" Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said at her weekly news conference on Monday. 
The action comes in the wake of a one-day nationwide nurses' strike in July and a series of smaller actions by government workers, challenging Ardern's center-left government, which ended almost a decade of center-right National Party rule in October.
The stand-off with its traditional union support base comes nine months after Labour formed a coalition government, promising to pour money into social services and rein in inequality, which has increased despite years of strong growth.
Wage growth has remained sluggish in the island nation for years, despite soaring housing costs, which labor groups and economists say has left workers struggling despite robust growth.
The government is also struggling with gloomy business confidence, which has sunk to decade lows and contributed to a surprise signal from the central bank on Thursday that it planned to keep rates on hold into 2020 and saw downside risks to its growth forecasts.

(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Tuesday revived a lawsuit by border policy activists challenging the constitutionality of a U.S. government policy requiring advance permission to take photos or shoot film at ports of entry on the U.S.-Mexico border.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Pasadena, California, ruled 3-0 that a lower court judge acted too hastily in dismissing Ray Askins' and Christian Ramirez's First Amendment claims against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection officials.
It faulted the judge for deciding in a ""conclusory fashion"" that the case should be dismissed because of the government's ""extremely compelling interest"" in border security and general interest in protecting U.S. territorial sovereignty.
While reasonable restrictions on speech might be justified, ""it is the government's burden to prove that these specific restrictions are the least restrictive means available to further its compelling interest,"" Circuit Judge Jay Bybee wrote for the appeals court.
""They cannot do so through general assertions of national security, particularly where plaintiffs have alleged that CBP is restricting First Amendment activities in traditional public fora such as streets and sidewalks,"" he added.
Andy Reuss, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Justice, declined to comment.
Mitra Ebadolahi, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said the decision lets her clients proceed with discovery.
According to Tuesday's decision, Askins had taken three or four photos of a vehicle inspection area when CBP officials briefly handcuffed him and confiscated his camera, deleting all but one of the photos.
The decision said Ramirez had taken about 10 photos of male border officials inspecting and patting down female travelers, before his camera was confiscated and the photos deleted. Both cameras were returned.
Bybee said ""further factual development is required before the (lower court judge) can determine what restrictions, if any, the government may impose in these public, outdoors areas.""

The case is Askins et al v U.S. Department of Homeland Security et al, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 16-55719.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (Reuters) - Roman Catholic priests in Pennsylvania sexually abused thousands of children over a 70-year period and silenced victims through ""the weaponization of faith"" and a systematic cover-up campaign by their bishops, the state attorney general said on Tuesday. 
An 884-page report made public by Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro after a two-year investigation contained graphic examples of children being groomed and sexually abused by clergymen. It was largely based on documents from secret archives kept by the dioceses, including handwritten confessions by priests, he said. 
""It was child sexual abuse, including rape, committed by grown men - priests - against children,"" Shapiro told a press conference. 
Representatives of the six Pennsylvania dioceses included in the report could not be reached for comment. 
The attorney general said it was the most comprehensive report on Catholic clergy sex abuse in American history, nearly two decades after an expose of widespread abuse and cover-up in Boston that rocked the Roman Catholic church.
Several of the dioceses issued statements apologizing to victims and saying they were taking steps to ensure any criminal behavior was stopped. ""The grand jury has challenged us as a Catholic diocese to put victims first and to continue to improve ways to protect children and youth,"" Bishop Lawrence Persico of the Erie Diocese said in a statement. 
As accusers wept behind him, Shapiro described alleged abuse by priests in six of the state's eight dioceses, including a group of Pittsburgh clergymen accused of ordering an altar boy to strip naked and pose as Christ on the cross while they photographed him. 
""The pattern was abuse, deny and cover up,"" Shapiro said, adding that church officials sought to keep abuse allegations quiet long enough so they could no longer be prosecuted under Pennsylvania's statute of limitations. 
""Priests were raping little boys and girls,"" Shapiro said. ""They hid it all for decades."" 
The report cited 301 priests, some of whom have died. Only two of the priests are still subject to prosecution.
A few of the clergymen accused in the report succeeded in having their names redacted, and Shapiro said he would argue at a Sept. 26 court hearing for making all the names public. 
He said the grand jury identified about a thousand victims, but believed there may be many more.
Shapiro said that one priest had molested five sisters in one family, he said. The diocese settled with the family after requiring a confidentiality agreement, he said.
The attorney general said that Catholic bishops covered up child sexual abuse by priests and reassigned them repeatedly to different parishes. “They allowed priests to remain active for as long as 40 years,” he said.
Describing the ""weaponization of faith"" to silence victims, Shapiro cited several examples including one priest who allegedly told children ""how Mary had to lick Jesus clean after he was born"" to groom them for oral sex.
""Children were taught that this abuse was not only normal but that it was holy,"" Shapiro said.
Since the Boston abuse scandal erupted in the 1990s, accusations involving American clerics have sporadically surfaced.
Theodore McCarrick, a former archbishop of Washington, resigned as a cardinal last month after accusations resurfaced that he abused a 16-year-old boy decades ago.

In recent months, Pope Francis accepted a number of resignations from Chilean bishops in a sex abuse scandal that has rocked that country.

Nasrallah was speaking on live television to mark the anniversary of a 2006 war it fought with Israel, which regards Iran as its biggest foe and Hezbollah as the top threat on its borders. 
""The resistance in Lebanon today, in its possession of weapons and equipment and capabilities and members and cadres and ability and expertise and experience, and also of faith and determination and courage and will, is stronger than at any time since its launch in the region,"" Nasrallah said. 
Israel has repeatedly struck Hezbollah in Syria, where the group and its Iranian ally have played a key military role in fighting rebels alongside Assad's forces, backed by massive Russian air power. 
Assad now holds most of Syria, although a swathe of the northwest remains in rebel hands and U.S.-backed Kurdish forces control the quarter of the country east of the Euphrates river. 
Israel has told Iran it must quit Syria, and said last year it had carried out air strikes there to stop Iranian weapons shipments to Hezbollah. 
Assad and his allies last month recaptured the area bordering the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, while avoiding a wider escalation involving Israel, Iran and Hezbollah. 

Concerns about such an escalation rose sharply in May, when Israel said it had launched its heaviest barrage since the Syrian war began in 2011 at Iranian targets in the country, prompting retaliatory rocket fire in the following days.

Chilean prosecutors said in a statement that the Chilean foreign ministry, through its embassy in Italy, had requested from the Vatican information related to nine clergy members accused of abuse. 
Prosecutors said in a statement that police had searched the offices of the Episcopal Conference, the Church leadership in Chile, looking for evidence of accusations made about members of the Marist Brothers religious community.Prosecutor Raul Guzman told reporters on Tuesday that police had collected documents and computers from the Episcopal Conference and had begun to process the information.
""This is a particular case which has to do with an ongoing investigation. The prosecutor wanted to complement the background that he already received by researching new information today,"" Jaime Coiro, a spokesman for the Episcopal Conference, told reporters after the raid. 
Several offices of senior church figures have been raided as prosecutors search for evidence of accusations of sexual abuse by clergy not reported to the civilian police, and evidence of cover-ups.
Earlier in August, the Episcopal Conference said it was committed to collaborating with civil authorities on accusations of abuse.
The scandal has rocked the Church in Chile. In June, the country's 34 bishops were summoned to Rome by the pope after Vatican investigators produced a 2,300-page report alleging that senior Church officials in Chile had failed to act on abuse claims and in some cases hid them.
Pope Francis has accepted resignations by five of those bishops.

Chilean prosecutors have said they are investigating 38 cases of sex crimes committed by clergy and lay people against minors and adults. There are 73 people under investigation and 104 victims, most of whom were minors at the time of the abuse.

Vice President Yemi Osinbajo is temporarily head of state while President Muhammadu Buhari, who plans to stand for re-election, takes a 10-day holiday in Britain.
Buhari came to power in 2015 on pledges to make Nigeria safer but violent crime remains endemic, a jihadist insurgency continues in the northeast, and security forces are regularly accused of acting with impunity.
Osinbajo instructed the head of the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) to reform the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) and ordered an independent investigation after ""persistent complaints and reports"" that bordered on ""allegations of human rights violations"", a presidency statement said.
The unit - responsible for tackling serious crime such as armed robbery, kidnapping and cattle rustling - has been dogged by allegations of abuses for years, although the NPF has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.
Following Osinbajo's instruction, NPF chief Inspector General Ibrahim Idris ""ordered the immediate overhauling"" of the unit, which would have a new head and human rights desk officers, and be renamed the Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (FSARS), the NPF said in a statement.
Last year, a social media campaign called for SARS to be disbanded as people shared stories, photographs and videos of alleged mistreatment.
The upper house of parliament voted in December 2017 to investigate SARS and, in the same month, Idris announced that the unit would be reorganized. The findings of the inquiry have yet to be announced.
Last week, Osinbajo fired Lawal Daura, head of the state security police, in the wake of a blockade of parliament by its agents.
On Tuesday, police detained a journalist for refusing to reveal the source of an article on a confidential letter from Idris to Osinbajo saying Daura had been behind the blockade, the reporter's newspaper said.

The story disclosed a letter from Inspector General Ibrahim Idris to acting president Yemi Osinbajo, Premium Times said. Other media also covered the letter.
President Muhammadu Buhari's administration has frequently come under fire for constricting press freedoms, and security services have often detained reporters. Nigeria ranks 119th out of 180 countries in Reporters Without Borders' World Press Freedom Index.
Reporter Samuel Ogundipe's phone was turned off when Reuters tried to contact him. Nigerian police did not respond to phone calls and messages seeking comment.
Premium Times said its editor-in-chief and another reporter had also been detained but released within a few hours. While in custody, they heard police asking Ogundipe for the source of the letter, the newspaper said.
Another reporter, Jones Abiri, has been in state security service custody since July 2016, appearing in court only this year after two years in detention without trial or family visits.
The chief of Nigeria's state security service, Lawal Daura, was fired by Osinbajo last week after his agents stopped lawmakers entering parliament, a blockade seen by the opposition as a bid to intimidate its leaders.
Ogundipe reported in the Premium Times that Idris had written to Osinbajo - Nigeria's vice president, in charge while Buhari takes two weeks' leave - to say an investigation had concluded that Daura had been behind the blockade.
The police force has also been dogged by problems recently. Osinbajo on Tuesday also ordered the overhaul of a controversial special unit following allegations of repeated human rights violations.

1278,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2018 02:20PM ET</span>",U.S. official warns of more actions against Turkey if pastor not freed,"By Steve Holland
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is warning more economic pressures may be in store for Turkey if it refuses to release a jailed American pastor, a White House official said on Tuesday, in a dispute that has further strained relations between the NATO allies.
The tough message emerged a day after White House national security adviser John Bolton met privately with Turkish ambassador Serdar Kilic about the case of evangelical pastor Andrew Brunson. Bolton warned him that the United States would not give any ground, a senior U.S. official said. 
The White House official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said ""nothing has progressed"" thus far on the Brunson case.
“The administration is going to stay extremely firm on this. The president is 100 percent committed to bringing Pastor Brunson home and if we do not see actions in the next few days or a week there could be further actions taken,"" the official said.
Further actions would likely take the form of economic sanctions, the official said, who added: “The pressure is going to keep up if we’re not seeing results.”
Relations between Turkey and the United States have been soured by Brunson’s detention, as well as diverging interests on Syria. Trump doubled tariffs on imports of Turkish steel and aluminum last week, contributing to a precipitous fall in the lira .
The United States is also considering a fine against Turkey’s state-owned Halkbank for allegedly helping Iran evade U.S. sanctions. Earlier this month, the United States imposed sanctions on two top officials in President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s cabinet in an attempt to get Turkey to turn over Brunson.
Brunson is accused of backing a coup attempt against Turkish Erdogan two years ago, charges that he has denied. He is being tried on terrorism charges.

Brunson has appealed again to a Turkish court to release him from house arrest and lift his travel ban, his lawyer told Reuters on Tuesday.

GAZA/RAMALLAH, West Bank (Reuters) - The United Nations agency dealing with Palestinian refugees may not be able to open schools for half a million children because it has run out of money since the United States cut its funding, U.N. officials say.
UNRWA already faces what it described as a ""very tense"" situation in Gaza after job cuts drew protests by its own employees, leaving some senior staff unable to work in their offices.
Some fear for the survival of the agency, which this month must decide whether it can open its network of schools across Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon for the coming academic year.
""We are running on empty. We simply don't have enough money to pay 22,000 teachers who in 711 schools provide a daily education for over half a million children,"" said UNRWA spokesman Chris Gunness, who described the situation as ""catastrophic"" and unprecedented.
U.N. officials say that aid cuts by the United States, the single largest donor to UNRWA, were a major cause of the crisis.
In January, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would scale back aid to the Palestinians unless they cooperate with his plans to revive peacemaking with Israel. Those peace efforts stalled in 2014.
""The actions that we are now seeing are consequences of the decision by the Trump administration to withhold $305 million for UNRWA this year, so whether it is political or not it has catastrophic implications and consequences for us on the ground,"" said Gunness.
WORRY AT SCHOOLS
Palestinian families, children and teachers said they were worried about whether schools will open at the end of August.
In the Israeli occupied West Bank, Reem Nakhla's children attend an UNRWA school in Jalazone refugee camp. In June staff and pupils were thrilled to be visited by Britain's Prince William during his tour of Israel and the West Bank. But now there is confusion outside the school gates.
""Of course I am worried, I think about where should I send them,"" said Nakhla. ""The UNRWA school is a big help to people,"" she added. ""Our situation in the camp is very difficult.""
UNRWA was founded in 1949 in the aftermath of the first Arab-Israel war.
That conflict saw 700,000 Palestinians forced to leave their homes or flee. UNRWA now helps around 5 million Palestinian refugees, who include descendants of those displaced by the fighting nearly 70 years ago.
Funded almost entirely by voluntary contributions from U.N. member states, the United States has long been its largest donor. But officials say that after the Trump administration slashed its contribution, UNRWA now needs more than $200 million from other donors to cover its deficit.
In January Trump tweeted ""we pay the Palestinians HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect. They don't even want to negotiate a long overdue peace treaty with Israel."" The U.S. State Department has said the agency needed to make unspecified reforms.
Israel has accused UNRWA of favoring Palestinians, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed Trump's decision to cut funding. ""This is how to rid the world of UNRWA and deal with genuine refugee problems, to the extent that such remain,"" he said in January.
In Gaza, Amal Al-Batsh, deputy chairman of the union of Palestinian employees at UNRWA, feared that the United States was targeting UNRWA's existence ""not as an institution but as a symbol and a witness to the issue of Palestinian refugees"".

President Mahmoud Abbas's Western-backed Fatah faction said the Palestinian leader would seek donations for UNRWA at the upcoming U.N. General Assembly meeting in September.

Greece has said the soldiers accidentally crossed into Turkey while following the trail of suspected illegal migrants. Turkish courts ordered their detention in March on suspicion of illegal entry and attempted military espionage.
The two soldiers said in their defense statement that they had crossed the border by mistake and the court then ruled for their release, Anadolu reported.
Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras welcomed the ruling.
""The release of the two Greek officers is an act of justice which will contribute to friendship, good neighborly relations and stability in the region,"" his office said in a statement.
Following a meeting with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on the sidelines of a NATO summit in July, Tsipras said that Greece and Turkey had agreed to focus efforts on easing tensions in the Aegean.
The two neighbors have been at odds over a host of issues from ethnically divided Cyprus to rights in the Aegean Sea.
In past decades relations between the two have at times been tense but recently rhetoric on both sides had taken a marked turn for the worse, particularly after the collapse of peace talks in Cyprus in July 2017.

Turkey has also called on Greece to return eight Turkish commandos who have sought asylum there after commandeering a helicopter to flee Turkey as a coup against Erdogan crumbled in July 2016. Turkey says they were involved in the putsch and demands they be returned to face trial.

Following several days of torrential rain throughout the northeastern United States, the National Weather Service issued new warnings for flooding in areas around Binghamton, New York, near the Pennsylvania border, and in New Jersey.
Federal forecasters warned that areas in the region could see as much as 4 inches (10 cm) more rain on Tuesday.
New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said in a statement five of the state's 21 counties were under a state of emergency, where additional rainfall could further complicate flood cleanup.
""Parts of our state have received nothing less than historic amounts of rain, and some communities received an entire month's worth in just a few hours,"" said Murphy.
The police department in Brick, a town of 75,000 on the Atlantic coast, said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that residents were barred from returning to 105 homes without a security escort until township officials finished inspecting them.
In Seneca County, New York, emergency crews were evacuating some residents by boat and taking them to a nearby shelter, the sheriff's office said in a statement.
""Flooding is one of the primary killers with regards to weather. It's not tornadoes. It's not wind damage,"" said Brett Rossio, an Accuweather meteorologist. ""It doesn't take much. Even just a foot of water can pull you away very easily.""
More than 8,000 people had lost power in areas drenched by the storms and the Red Cross said it was operating shelters. It was not immediately clear how many people were in them.
""It's Mother Nature so it's a fluid situation, watching where the rain falls and if there's additional evacuations necessary,"" said Jay Bonafede, the Red Cross spokesman.
Both Pennsylvania and New York have already activated their emergency response centers for the storms, which started over the weekend.
Molly Dougherty, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency, said some people affected by the flooding had been recovering from deluges three weeks ago.

""People are looking at losses of most of their belongings and, in some cases, we're still concerned about the safety of folks and making sure they're able to stabilize,"" said Dougherty.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia (Reuters) - Lawmakers in Bosnia's autonomous Serb-dominated region asked the regional government on Tuesday to revoke a 2004 report which concluded that Bosnian Serb forces killed about 8,000 Muslims in and around Srebrenica during the country's 1992-95 war.
The vote was initiated by Serb Republic nationalist President Milorad Dodik, and some analysts say it is the latest issue used by Serb ruling parties to mobilize voters around the nationalist agenda ahead of elections in October.
Dodik, an advocate of the Serb region's secession from Bosnia, has always rejected rulings by two war crimes courts, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and The International Court of Justice, that the atrocity qualified as genocide.
Though acknowledging a crime occurred, Dodik says the numbers of those killed had been exaggerated in the 2004 report.
""The report is irrelevant, extremely selective, incorrect and tendentious,"" Dodik told the parliament, saying it should have included Serb victims in Srebrenica. 
The parliament concluded that a new independent international commission should be formed to determine the damages suffered by all peoples in the Srebrenica region.
The Bosniaks dismissed the motion. ""No revision of this report can change the evidence proven in courts about this and other cases of grave war crimes,"" said Ramiz Salkic, the Bosniak vice-president of the Serb Republic. 
The EU delegation in Bosnia said in a statement: ""The European Union rejects any denial, relativisation or misinterpretation of the genocide in Srebrenica. We also condemn the use of inflammatory ethno-political rhetoric and actions.""
A joint statement from three other bodies including the U.S. Embassy to Bosnia was also critical, saying they ""strongly condemn the cynical utilization of the Srebrenica Commission’s Report of 2004 for political purposes in the run-up to the elections.""

The gang ransacked 73 deposit boxes at the Hatton Garden Safety Deposit building in the London jewelry district three years ago, stealing gold, silver, diamonds and jewellery worth 14 million pounds. Two-thirds of the haul was not recovered.
Daniel Jones, 63, was sentenced to seven years in prison in 2016, and on Tuesday he was given another six years and 287 days after failing to pay 6.6 million pounds, comprising his part of a joint confiscation order and his other assets.
""Daniel Jones gained millions of pounds of criminal cash from the Hatton Garden burglary,"" Heather Chalk of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said in a statement.
""The CPS showed the court that Jones had the funds to pay back his ill-gotten gains and today we have successfully argued that his default sentences should be activated.""
Jones, along with other gang-members Brian Reader, John Collins and Terry Perkins, were given a joint confiscation order of 6.4 million pounds, plus extra sums dependent on their personal circumstances.
Perkins died in jail in February, and the CPS said that it would take steps to recover funds from his estate.

""Perhaps we need more time to arrive at a final formula,"" he said to reporters before a meeting of members of parliament from his party in Beirut. 
Lebanese politicians have repeatedly warned that the country - which has one of the world's highest rates of public debt - urgently needs to put a government in place, but they have jostled over cabinet positions. 
""There is no doubt that some sides still stick to their terms, but, as we see, all of them retreat and concede a little,"" he said, adding that the new government needed to include all sides. 
The May 6 elections delivered a majority for the Shi'ite Hezbollah and its parliamentary allies, a reversal of the previous vote in 2009, when groups with Western and Saudi support won most seats.
The result has further complicated Lebanon's tangled sectarian politics, as Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims, Christians and Druze compete among themselves for ministries. 
The delay in forming the government has prompted recriminations between rival parties. 
Last week, Hezbollah members of parliament warned that the delay risked Lebanon ""sliding towards tensions"".
""We are a state that has problems, and we must form a national unity government in which cooperation between all the parties. Otherwise we will create a problem in the cabinet,"" Hariri said. 
The International Monetary Fund has warned that Lebanon needs ""an immediate and substantial fiscal adjustment"" to make its public debt - which measures about 150 percent of gross domestic product - sustainable.

BAMAKO (Reuters) - Malian President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita has won re-election ""comfortably"" based on his campaign's vote count, his spokesman said on Tuesday, dismissing claims from the opposition that they won.
With official results not expected for a few days, the two sides have been swapping counterclaims and accusations since Monday's second-round run-off. 
The ballot pitted Keita, who is seeking a second term to rule the West African gold- and cotton-producing country, against opposition leader Soumaila Cisse, who said on Monday that the vote was fraudulent and that he was victor.
Cisse has not provided concrete evidence for his accusations and Keita has denied any wrongdoing. 
The poll was tarnished by voting irregularities and militant violence that shut nearly 500 polling stations on Monday, about 2 percent of the total. Turnout was also low. 
""The results issued from our campaign headquarters indicate that Ibrahim Boubacar Keita would be comfortably re-elected,"" his campaign manager Bocary Treta told reporters. 
European Union observers said on Tuesday they saw irregularities but not fraud.
""The vote generally took place calmly, despite security incidents in the center and north,"" EU mission head Cecile Kyenge told reporters in the capital Bamako. 
""Our observers did not see fraud but problems of irregularities,"" she said, citing threats by armed groups and a lack of communication between election officials. 
Mali is a major concern for Western powers due to the presence of militant groups with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State.
EU observers did not deploy to some regions in the north and center due to repeated attacks there by jihadist groups and ethnic militia this year that have killed hundreds of civilians, Malian troops and U.N. peacekeepers. 
A Malian observer group estimated turnout for the second round at only about 27 percent of 8 million registered voters due to security fears and voter apathy. 

Keita won the first round on July 29 with about 41 percent of the vote despite his government's failure to slow the surging violence.

PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - The Taliban are considering announcing a ceasefire during next week's Eid holiday, despite heavy fighting seen over recent days in the central Afghan city of Ghazni, two senior Taliban officials said.
They said no decision had been taken but senior leaders would meet either on Tuesday evening or Wednesday to discuss the option, which was being pushed by some Muslim states and other parties with good relations to the movement.
If agreed, it may be announced in Ghazni province, where the Taliban say they control most of the districts around the provincial capital.
Prior to the fighting in Ghazni, which has killed and wounded hundreds, there had been strong hopes of a repeat of the three-day truce during the Eid-al Fitr holiday in June, the most concrete sign of progress towards peace since talks between the government and Taliban broke down in 2015.
The government said last month it was considering offering a ceasefire during Eid-al Adha, the annual feast of sacrifice, which begins next week but has so far not confirmed the offer and there has been no response from the Taliban.
""Our friends are advising us that we should announce a four-day ceasefire for the upcoming Eid-al Azha so that the people of Afghanistan can peacefully celebrate their Eid like they did two months ago,"" one of the Taliban officials said.
""As usual there would be divided opinion on a ceasefire like we faced last time during Eid-al Fitr but our supreme leader Sheikh Hahahahah Akhunzada would then play his role and would either announce the ceasefire or may ask the fighters to continue their fight,"" said the official, a member of the shura, or leadership council.
Another Taliban leader said he hoped their leadership might announce a ceasefire as last time it had helped win hearts and minds of the people of Afghanistan, with unarmed fighters and soldiers seen mingling on the streets of Kabul and other cities.
""The demand is for one week but our leadership may announce four days of ceasefire to enable the Afghan people to buy sacrificial animals and celebrate Eid-ul-Azha in a peaceful environment,"" he said.
Asked who the ""friends"" were, the first official said the Taliban had friends and allies in many parts of the world.
In January, President Ashraf Ghani offered the Taliban peace talks without conditions and the United States has dropped its previous refusal to talk to the Taliban, saying it would be willing to participate in an Afghan-led process.
Taliban officials say they have spoken directly to the top U.S. official on Afghanistan and Pakistan in Qatar, where the Taliban maintains a political office and a delegation travelled to Uzbekistan this month to discuss issues including peace.

The South American country's government has accused opposition politicians and anti-Maduro activists abroad of scheming to assassinate the leftist leader with the drones, which were laden with explosives, during a military parade. 
Fourteen people, including a lawmaker and several young men, have been arrested, while another 20 suspects remain at large, including in neighboring Colombia and the United States, according to authorities.
Saab said Colonel Pedro Zambrano and General Alejandro Perez had been presented in court on Monday. 
Further details were not immediately available about the detainees. 
The Information Ministry, which handles media inquiries on behalf of the government, did not respond to a request for comment. Reuters was unable to contact the two officers.
The alleged involvement of military officials in the drone incident is notable in the convulsed oil-rich nation where the armed forces have long been powerbrokers. 
Open calls for military intervention have grown after massive anti-government protests last year failed to unseat Maduro and he was re-elected in a May vote widely decried as a sham. 
Scores of soldiers have been detained on accusations of conspiring against Maduro or of desertion, as they too sometimes struggle to eat three square meals a day amid the worst economic crisis in the country's history and a severe food shortage.
The government has said the drone attack was carried out by 11 hit men recruited during anti-Maduro demonstrations and trained across the porous border with Colombia. 
Authorities have said financiers in Bogota and Florida promised the group $50 million and a stay in the United States in exchange for killing Maduro.
Maduro's critics say he is using the incident to stifle dissent and cement his power in the oil-rich nation amid the economic crisis that has brought with it salary-destroying hyperinflation and frequent power cuts.
He says his government is the victim of an ""economic war"" led by opposition activists with the help of Washington, and that the United States government is seeking to undermine him as it did in the past with other Latin American leftists.

Around 100,000 mostly peaceful protesters were demonstrating against the Social Democrat (PSD) government on Friday when riot police used a water cannon on them and indiscriminately sprayed tear gas into the crowd. More than 400 required medical assistance and dozens were taken to hospital.
Some protesters threw bottles and rocks at riot police, who chose not to remove them from the crowd. Video recordings show police beating journalists and non-violent protesters holding their hands up. 
Prosecutors said they were investigating the riot police, Interior Minister Carmen Dan and Speranta Cliseru, the Bucharest prefect who authorized the use of force, on suspicion of abusive behavior, abuse of office and negligence. 
Among Friday's victims of violence were a cameraman from Austrian public television as well as some Israeli tourists who were not attending the protest and were taken out of a taxi by riot police and beaten. Austrian and Israeli officials condemned the violence and asked Romania for an explanation.
""We consider this incident as unacceptable and extremely serious,"" the Israeli embassy said. 
Riot police have said the use of force was justified and that their intervention was gradual and proportionate. The interior minister said she had nothing to blame herself for.
The violence was criticized by centrist president Klaus Iohannis, rights groups and the European Commission.
On Tuesday, Amnesty International expressed serious concerns about the ""allegations of disproportionate and indiscriminate use of chemical irritants ... which may contravene Romania's obligations under international law"".
There have been repeated protests since the Social Democrats took power in early 2017 and tried to decriminalize several corruption offences. Smaller, peaceful rallies continued over the weekend and on Monday. 
Earlier this year, changes to the criminal code raised concerns from the European Commission and the U.S. State Department. The changes have been challenged in the Constitutional Court.
Romania ranks as one of the EU's most corrupt states and Brussels keeps its justice system under special monitoring.
""The protesters have criticized the reversal of progress in the fields of judicial reform and the fight against corruption,"" a Commission spokesperson said on Tuesday. 

""Peaceful protests ended in violence. Violence can never be a solution in politics.""

Part of the Old City, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, has been razed by bombing. Now only rubble and straggly palm trees remain, where unique tower houses once stood.
""Many buildings have been badly damaged and are only skeletons now,"" Umat al-Razzak, manager of traditional housing, told Reuters.
The Old City is dominated by two hues - that of the baked mud bricks and of the lighter gypsum used for the houses' ornate arched window frames and external geometric decorations.
Sanaa is said to have been founded two and half millennia ago and its old heart once bustled with traders and drew tourists in calmer times.
The ancient city remained an area of relative calm during the 2011 uprising in Yemen which led to the downfall of late President Ali Abdullah Saleh, but the war between the alliance of Sunni Muslim Arab states and the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement that now controls the capital has brought havoc.
Resident Abu Hani-Elaifa said he remembers clearly the night in September 2015 -- the year that a Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen's war -- when his neighborhood was hit.
""I was standing outside my house. There were warplanes overhead and then they hit this house while the family was having dinner,"" he told Reuters, pointing to the rubble which still lies there.
UNESCO said it is assessing the impact of the conflict on the Old City and other sites in Yemen, but it was too early to quantify the extent of the damage.
""Unfortunately, it is not a situation unique to Sanaa, as heritage has been affected in all parts of the country,"" Director of the World Heritage Centre, Mechtild Roessler, said in a statement to Reuters.
The organization listed the al-Qasimi area in Sanaa, the Old City of Saadah and Marib Dam, the archaeological city of Baraqish, Al Qahirah citadel in Taiz and Hadramout's ancient tombs as being severely damaged. It said the 9th century mosque of Bani Matar and Dhamar Museum have been completely destroyed.
""UNESCO reiterates the utmost need for all actors in the conflict to avoid destruction of irreplaceable sites, monuments and museum collections in Yemen, which are critical to the identities of local people and of global significance for the history of art, architecture, science and culture.""
Residents in Sanaa hope the Old City will not be forgotten.

""Protecting this city is an international responsibility, not just a Yemeni responsibility,"" said Abdullah Ahmed al-Kabsi, the official in charge of culture in the Houthi administration.

PRISTINA (Reuters) - A redrawing of the border to bring parts of Serbia with a majority Albanian population into Kosovo could end persistent tensions between Belgrade and Pristina and allow both nations to move towards EU membership, Kosovo's president said on Tuesday.
Hashim Thaci told Reuters in an interview that he would present his plan to Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic when they meet in September in Brussels as part of a dialogue sponsored by the European Union.
Normalizing bilateral relations is a key condition for both Serbia and Kosovo to advance towards their eventual goal of EU membership. The Balkan neighbors agreed in 2013 to resolve all pending issues but have so far made little progress.
""Definitely now is the moment to correct the border between Kosovo and Serbia, which is around 400 kilometers (250 miles) long,"" Thaci said.
""This would help avoid inter-ethnic problems and creating any sort of autonomous region such as the Serb Republic (in Bosnia).""
Thaci did not say what Serbia might receive in return for giving up such territory - home to up to 70,000 ethnic Albanians - and rejected any partition of Kosovo along ethnic lines. 
""Correcting borders will definitely avoid Kosovo's partition, swapping territories, more crises or problems or even possibly a new war,"" he said. 
""EU PERSPECTIVE"" 
Kosovo, whose population of 1.8 million is mainly ethnic Albanian, declared independence from Belgrade in 2008, a decade after NATO bombed rump-Yugoslavia to end the killing of Albanian civilians by Serb forces during a two-year insurgency. 
It is now recognized by more than 100 nations but not by Serbia, Russia and five EU states. Belgrade and Moscow have blocked Kosovo from joining the United Nations.
Some Serbian media and politicians have suggested redrawing the border to bring a part of northern Kosovo populated mainly by Serbs into Serbia and in return to give parts of southern Serbia with an Albanian majority to Kosovo. 
Around 100,000 Serbs live in Kosovo, half of them north of the Ibar River in towns where they form a majority. The rest lives south of the river in areas with an Albanian majority. 
A majority of the Serbs living in Kosovo do not recognize that country's institutions and still regard Belgrade as their capital. 
Vucic suggested last week he was prepared to compromise on defining Serbia's borders with Kosovo, though observers say the two sides remain far apart. Most Serbs view Kosovo as the cradle of their nation and Orthodox Christian faith.
Western countries are also uneasy about any redrawing of borders in the Balkans.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday that the territorial integrity of Western Balkan states was ""sacrosanct"". 
The British embassy in Pristina said ""calls for re-drawing national borders could be de-stabilizing"".
But Thaci said he was confident that Western countries would support any agreement signed between him and Vucic, which he believes can be reached by February 2019. 
""If the parties agree in the process of the dialogue and they reach an agreement, the EU and the United States will support any deal on border correction,"" Thaci said.

""We are following a peaceful process and this will avoid problems, avoid crises and will open an EU perspective for both countries.""

It was unclear what triggered Monday night's unrest but Sweden has seen a rise in violence in areas with high unemployment and other social problems and the incident echoed rioting in the capital Stockholm in 2013.
Mounting public concern about gang-related and other violence has become a central issue in campaigning ahead of a national election on Sept. 9.
Police said that up to 100 cars were either set fire to or vandalized in Gothenburg, Sweden's second-biggest city located in the western part of the country, and in nearby towns such as Falkenberg and Trollhattan, an industrial area with high unemployment. There were no reports of injuries.
Two men, 16 and 21 years old, were arrested on Tuesday and police said it expected to make more arrests during the day.
Police said gangs were involved but gave no details.
Swedish towns have seen sporadic violence on a smaller scale in mid-August in recent years at the end of the school summer break.
""We believe that up to 100 cars have been burned or damaged,"" police spokeswoman Ulla Brehm said.
""They were organized and prepared.""
A handful of cars were also burned overnight in Stockholm. 
""It seems very organized, almost like a military operation,"" Lofven said in an interview on Swedish radio. ""Society is always going to react strongly to this kind of thing."" Lofven visited the region on Tuesday and met police.
The violence echoed rioting by hundreds of youths in Stockholm and some of its poorer suburbs in 2013, sparked by the police killing of a 69-year-old man wielding a machete in a suburb that prompted accusations of police brutality. 
Law and order is a key issue ahead of the election after a spike in gang violence saw more than 40 people shot dead last year.
Despite economic growth that has for years been the envy of most of Europe, Lofven's Social Democrats, the bigger party in the current minority coalition, are on track for their worst ever election result, according to opinion polls.
Voters also worry about the welfare system, falling school results and the effects of a surge in immigration that saw around 160,000 people seek asylum in Sweden in 2015.
The concerns have benefited the populist, anti-immigration Sweden Democrats who look poised to become one of the three biggest parties in parliament after the vote.

1296,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2018 09:10AM ET</span>",Turkey hopes to find solution on Syria's Idlib with Russia,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey's foreign minister said on Tuesday he hoped his country and Russia could find a solution over the northern Syrian region of Idlib, a rebel-held enclave which the Syrian government says it aims to recapture.
The Idlib region, a refuge for civilians and rebels displaced from other areas of Syria as well as powerful jihadist forces, was hit by a wave of air strikes and shelling last week, in a possible prelude to a full-scale government offensive.
Turkey, which has backed some rebel groups in the region and set up a dozen military observation posts, is trying to avert an attack by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who is backed by Moscow.
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said it was important to distinguish between ""terrorists"", rebel fighters and up to three million civilians in Idlib.
""We need to determine these terrorist (groups) and eliminate them with intelligence and military forces,"" he said in Ankara ahead of talks with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, whose country has backed Assad militarily.
""It would be a massacre to bomb Idlib, civilians, hospitals, schools just because there are terrorists.""
Idlib is controlled by an array of insurgent groups, with Sunni Muslim jihadists believed to be the dominant force there.
""We need to differentiate between moderate rebels and radicals. The local people and the moderate rebels are very disturbed by these terrorists so we need to fight against them all together,"" Cavusoglu said.
Last week U.N. humanitarian adviser Jan Egeland said that Turkey, Russia and Iran had all agreed to ""do their utmost to avoid"" a battle in Idlib.
The Syrian army dropped leaflets over Idlib province on Thursday, urging people to agree to a return of state rule, telling them the seven year war was nearing its end. (nL5N1V06HT)
Lavrov, speaking at a news conference with Cavusoglu, also said Moscow was surprised at what he said was Western opposition to refugee returns to Syria.
""A huge (portion) of Syria has been freed of terrorists. It’s time to rebuild infrastructure, all living necessities for refugees from Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and from Europe to start returning to their home,"" he said.
Russia's foreign ministry said on Monday a four-way Syria summit ""is planned in the upcoming future"", with the leaders of Russia, France, Turkey and Germany attending.

A section of the bridge crashed down from a height of about 50 meters over a river and some railroad tracks and buildings. It collapsed at about 11:30 a.m. (0930 GMT) during torrential rainfall, the local fire brigade said.
The head of the ambulance service said there were ""dozens of dead"", according to Italian news agency Adnkronos. At least 10 people were killed and 20 vehicles were involved, local police sources said. 
Helicopter footage on social media showed trucks and cars stranded on either side of the roughly 80-metre long collapsed section of the bridge, which was built on the A10 toll motorway in the 1960s.
An ambulance official told Reuters the service could only confirm two injured people so far, ""but we suppose there are unfortunately a lot of dead.""
Restructuring work on the bridge, which was 1.2 km long in total, was carried out in 2016. The highway operator said work to shore up the foundation of the bridge was being carried out at the time of the collapse, adding that the bridge was constantly monitored.
The highway is a major artery to the Italian Riviera and to France's southern coast. Train services around Genoa have been halted.
A witness told Sky Italia television he saw ""eight or nine"" vehicles on the bridge when it collapsed in what he said was an ""apocalyptic scene"".
Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli said in a tweet that he was ""following with great apprehension what seems like an immense tragedy"".
The office of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said he was heading to Genoa in the evening and would remain there on Wednesday. Defence minister Elisabetta Trenta said the army was ready to offer manpower and vehicles to help with the rescue operations.

Shares in Atlantia, the toll road operator which runs the motorway, were suspended after falling 6.3 percent after news of the collapse.

1299,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2018 08:50AM ET</span>",Outcry in Malaysia over two women sentenced to caning for lesbian sex,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Human rights activists called on Tuesday on Malaysian authorities to review a religious court decision sentencing two women to six strokes for having sex.
The lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community is routinely persecuted in Muslim-majority Malaysia, where they are seen as a threat to conservative values.
Media on Sunday said the women were charged under Islamic laws forbidding lesbian sex at the Shariah High Court in Terengganu, a conservative state ruled by the Islamist opposition party Pan-Malaysian Islamist Party (PAS).
The women, aged 32 and 22, pleaded guilty and were sentenced to caning and a 3,300 ringgit ($806) fine, according to the Malay-language newspaper Sinar Harian.
""Adequate punishment must be meted out so that this becomes a lesson and reminder to not just the two of you, but the members of society,"" the daily quoted Shariah judge Kamalruazmi Ismail as saying.
Reuters' calls to the Shariah High Court in Terengganu were not answered. 
Malaysia's minister for religious affairs was overseas and could not be reached for comment, his spokesman said. 
Amnesty International Malaysia said caning amounted to torture and called on the government to repeal laws that impose punishment against marginalized communities.
The court ruling indicated a ""concerning climate"" of LGBT discrimination and a ""growing threat on the lives and the safety"" of LGBT people in Malaysia, the group's interim executive director, Gwen Lee, said in a statement to Reuters.
Malaysia describes oral and anal sex as against the order of nature. Civil law stipulates jail for up to 20 years, caning and fines for offenders.
Muslims are also governed by state-level Islamic laws, most of which carry provisions outlawing gay and lesbian sex.
A coalition of Malaysian human rights organizations said in a joint statement it was concerned about the impact of the sentence not only on the two women but on the wider LGBT community.
""Consensual sex acts between adults is not a crime,"" said the coalition, which included transgender rights group Justice for Sisters and the All Women's Action Society. 
Activists say intolerance towards the LGBT community has increased in recent years in Malaysia.
Last week, authorities removed the portraits of two LGBT activists from a public photography exhibition, saying they promoted LGBT activities.
In February, a newspaper article detailing how to identify LGBT individuals sparked outrage on social media. ($1=4.09 ringgit)

KAMPALA (Reuters) - Ugandan police arrested three opposition lawmakers and scores of others after stones were thrown at the convoy of President Yoweri Museveni, who has ruled the country since 1986.
Supporters of independent candidate Kasiano Wadri obstructed and attacked Museveni's convoy in the northern town of Arua late on Monday and one vehicle bearing the presidential coat of arms had its rear windscreen shattered, police spokesman Emirian Kayima said.
""Security officers intervened to contain the situation and they indeed halted it from further escalation by use teargas and shooting,"" Kayima told a news conference, adding that scores of suspects had been arrested.
Those arrested included Robert Kyagulanyi, an independent lawmaker and musician who has gained popularity since he joined parliament last year through scathing criticism of Museveni's government, sometimes expressed through music.
Government officials see his appeal, especially to young people, as a threat to Museveni, whose popularity has suffered due to what some voters say are deteriorating public services, corruption and rights abuses.
Parliament last year removed an age limit from the constitution that would have barred Museveni from seeking re-election in 2021.
Late on Monday, Kyagulanyi, known as Bobi Wine, said police shot at his vehicle and killed his driver during campaigning for a parliamentary by-election due to be held on Wednesday in Arua. Kayima said he was unsure who killed the driver. 

Kayima said two journalists had also been arrested during the incident and released on police bond.

1301,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2018 08:02AM ET</span>",Man suspected of terrorism attack on UK parliament after driving into pedestrians,"By Kylie MacLellan and Hannah McKay
LONDON (Reuters) - British police said they believe a man deliberately drove a car into pedestrians and cyclists on Tuesday before ramming it into barriers outside London's parliament in what appeared to be the second terrorism attack on the building in just under 18 months.
Three people were injured after the vehicle was driven through a group of cyclists and pedestrians during the early morning rush hour before smashing into a protective barrier on a lane used for accessing parliament.
The driver, a man in his 20s, was arrested by armed officers at the scene moments later. 
""Given that this appears to be a deliberate act, the method, and this being an iconic site, we are treating it as a terrorist incident,"" London Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said.
In March 2017, Khalid Masood, 52, killed four people on nearby Westminster Bridge and stabbed to death an unarmed police officer in the grounds of parliament before being shot dead. 
It was the first of five attacks on Britain last year which police blamed on terrorism, three of which involved vehicles being used as a weapon. 
Basu said the suspect in Tuesday's incident was in custody but was not co-operating with detectives. Although he had not been formally identified, the man was not believed to be known to security forces, Basu added.
""At this early stage of the investigation, no other suspects at the scene have been identified or reported to police,"" Basu said. ""There is no intelligence of further danger to Londoners or the rest of the UK in connection with this incident.""
Police said a silver Ford Fiesta had collided with a number of cyclists and pedestrians before crashing into barriers outside the Houses of Parliament at 0637 GMT. No other weapons had been found, Basu said.
Camera footage showed the vehicle taking a wrong turn into a group of cyclists waiting at traffic lights before veering across the road and into a lane leading to parliament before hitting the barrier as two police officers jumped to safety.
Two people were taken to hospital and one woman was still receiving treatment for serious but not life-threatening injuries. 
Armed officers swarmed the scene and cordoned off a large area around the parliament building in central London, usually bustling with tourists and government workers.
""IT LOOKED PLANNED""
""I saw the cyclists, injured cyclists. I don't know if he's hit these people, or if they've just dived to escape,"" witness Jason Williams told reporters. ""It didn't swerve, there was not another car going behind him. It looked like it was planned."" 
Images shot by a Euronews journalist showed police pointing their guns at the vehicle shortly after the crash. Footage on social media showed a handcuffed man being led away by heavily armed police. 
British Prime Minister Theresa May, who like other lawmakers is on holiday during parliament's summer recess, said her thoughts were with the people injured. Government security officials were due to hold a meeting of their emergency committee at 1300 GMT to discuss the incident.
""All Londoners, like me, utterly condemn all acts of terrorism on our city,"" London's Mayor Sadiq Khan said on Twitter.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who has previously spoken out about security issues in London, also commented on the incident.
""These animals are crazy and must be dealt with through toughness and strength,"" Trump said on Twitter.
Westminster Underground station, close to parliament, was closed to the public and the building cordoned off. 
Nigel Evans, a lawmaker from May's Conservative Party, said the incident had shown security measures at parliament were effective but might still need to be reviewed.
""I’m sure that (debate about) pedestrianization of Parliament Square (NYSE:SQ) and which vehicles should be able to access so closely in parliament will be reignited,"" he told BBC TV.
Britain is on its second-highest threat level of ""severe"", meaning an attack is considered highly likely and the authorities say a dozen Islamist plots had been foiled since Masood's attack in Westminster last year. 
Last week, a Muslim convert admitted plotting to kill more than 100 people by driving a truck into pedestrians on London's Oxford Street, the capital's major shopping thoroughfare.

In October last year, 11 people were injured when a car collided with pedestrians near London’s Natural History Museum, raising fears of an attack, but police later said the incident was a road traffic accident.

1302,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2018 07:50AM ET</span>","As forgiveness sweeps Ethiopia, some wonder about justice","By Maggie Fick
NAIROBI (Reuters) - Ethiopia has released thousands of prisoners as a new prime minister reverses decades of security abuses. No-one knows how many were tortured. 
But some of those torture victims are now talking openly - to the media, to their relatives and to their friends - about what happened to them after they were jailed, in many cases for protesting against the government. 
Their stories raise a hard question for the government: how will it address the injustices committed by security forces behind prison walls? 
Since coming to power in April, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, 41, has made peace with Eritrea, ended a state of emergency, freed political prisoners and announced plans to sell shares in state-owned firms to promote growth and create jobs.
Abiy acknowledges that many prisoners suffered abuses, which he has denounced as acts of ""state terrorism"".
He has not, however, announced plans to investigate abuses committed by the security forces or set up a process for victims to seek redress. But he has preached forgiveness.
""I call on us all to forgive each other from our hearts. To close the chapters from yesterday, and to forge ahead to the next bright future through national consensus,"" Abiy said in his inaugural address.
Rights groups that have documented the torture - from psychological torment to the use of water and ceiling hooks - say there must now be a greater focus on justice.
""Despite all the reforms, there have yet to be any detailed commitments regarding investigations into abuses or justice for victims,"" said Maria Burnett of Human Rights Watch.
Since late 2015, when protests against ethnic marginalization and inequality began, tens of thousands of people were detained, according to Human Rights Watch.
The attorney general's office and government spokesman Ahmed Shide did not respond to calls and messages requesting comment. 
""WE NEED HELP""
Those who spent years imprisoned and were recently released say they are cautiously hopeful. 
""I never expected such changes were possible as long as the EPRDF (ruling coalition) remained in power. But even now we don't know what will come of all this,"" said Keyfalew Tefera, 33, who says his legs were amputated in a prison hospital after security forces shot him in 2006 when he was passing by a student protest. 
Keyfalew, who studied plant science before he was detained, says his suffering should not be forgotten. 
""I'm still a prisoner. I left half my body in there, I have no legs,"" he said, in an interview in a friend's living room. His mother and father died during his 12 years in prison. ""I don't consider myself free.""
Another former prisoner, Mesfin Etana, 43, spent 16 years behind bars for alleged membership in the Oromo Liberation Front, a group removed from the government's banned list of ""terrorist"" groups in June. 
No evidence against him was produced by authorities, he said, but after six years in prison, a court gave him a life sentence. 
He told Reuters that he was repeatedly stripped naked and sexually humiliated by warders during a five-month stint at Maekelawi, a detention center shut down after Abiy took office.
He cannot afford treatment for health problems that are mainly related to torture. It is not only physical injuries he is confronting. 
Before Mesfin's arrest in 2002, he was a trader and shop owner and was preparing to marry his fiancée Zinash. 
He was released on July 4. One of the first things he did was call Zinash, to find she had married another man at her family's insistence.
""It was very sad,"" he said of their conversation.
He was happy to be alive, but without earnings from his business, his family had fallen into poverty.
""We don't want revenge, but we need help,"" he said. 
""We would be happy if the government returned what we used to have,"" he said, adding that he felt justice was important to prevent the country from ""going backward"". 
PAST CRIMES
Due process for victims will require overhauling the institutions that failed Ethiopians in the past, some argue.
""A lot of work needs to be done because the judiciary has been disgraced,"" said lawyer Wondimu Ebsa, who represented hundreds of prisoners and opposition leaders in trials he decried as a mockery of justice. 
Many of his clients have been freed but they are struggling.
""They don't have money for food, they can't get work,"" he said. ""So many of them are living in worse conditions than they were in prison.""
Ethiopia's constitution requires the state to compensate torture victims, he said, because the government failed to protect them from harm. 
Concerns that past crimes may be papered over were raised by an encounter in Zimbabwe earlier this month that went viral on social media. 
Former prime minister Hailemariam Desalegn, who resigned in February and was in Harare observing elections, met Ethiopia's exiled former Marxist dictator, Mengistu Haile Mariam. 
During Mengistu's 17 years in power, millions of Ethiopians died of famine amid ""Red Terror"" purges. In 2007, he was sentenced in absentia to life in prison, but Zimbabwe declined to extradite him.

""This photo (of Hailemariam and Mengistu) ... is confounding,"" Ethiopian law professor Awol Allo wrote on Twitter. ""It is fantastic that our government is talking about love, forgiveness, & reconciliation but does that mean we are prepared to give a free-for-all, no-questions-asked, amnesty?""

Singapore authorities had not previously confirmed that the $35-million private jet, which Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has said he is seeking to repossess, was in the city.
Aviation services firm Jet Aviation said on Monday a jet, which the U.S. Department of Justice alleges was bought by fugitive financier Low Taek Jho using funds taken from 1MDB, was at their facility at Singapore's Seletar Airport.
""Singapore has not received any formal request from the Malaysian authorities seeking the return of the aircraft,"" a police spokesman said.
""Any such request, along with other requests for the return of seized 1MDB-related assets, will be dealt with in accordance with Singapore's legal framework.""
Singapore authorities in 2016 said they had seized S$240 million ($175 million) in funds and properties as part of investigations into 1MDB-related fund flows through Singapore, of which about half belonged to Low and his family. 
Malaysian authorities have issued an arrest warrant for Low, whose whereabouts are not known. Low, whose Malaysian passport has been revoked, has previously denied any wrongdoing.
Last week, the $250 million superyacht Equanimity, which the U.S. Department of Justice says was also bought by Low, was handed over to Malaysia by Indonesia, which had seized the vessel this year.
A representative for Low has said the handing over of the yacht to Malaysia was illegal and in violation of Indonesian and U.S. court orders.

Their cheesemaking exploits have since blossomed into a business and the couple sell 10 types of cheese, from their home in the foothills of the Sayan mountains that range from southern Siberia to northern Mongolia. These include a type of Cheddar, Emmental, Edam, and Lambert.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A firefighter has been killed battling the largest wildfire in Californian history that has been stoked by prime fire weather conditions as it has destroyed dozens of homes. 
The unidentified firefighter was killed on Monday while battling the Ranch Fire, one of two blazes that make up the Mendocino Complex, which has already charred about 349,000 acres (141,200 hectares), the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said. 
The Utah firefighter was airlifted to a hospital where he died, fire officials said during a news conference late on Monday. 
""We are extremely heartbroken for this loss,"" Mendocino Complex incident commander Sean Kavanaugh said, adding that officials will release more information as it becomes available.
The firefighter was the sixth person killed battling California's intense wildfires this year, which have been some of the most destructive in more than a decade as they have forced tens of thousands to evacuate. 
The Mendocino Complex, which has destroyed 146 homes since it began on July 27, has been stoked by persistent hot, dry and windy conditions. Crews have been able to cut containment lines around 68 percent of the northern California fire, Cal Fire said. 
The complex is one of about 110 major wildfires burning across the western United States which have burned more than 8,900 sq miles (23,000 sq km), an area larger than the state of New Jersey, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.
Though temperatures had dropped from their triple-digit highs in recent days, they were expected to stay above 90 degrees F (32 C) through Friday. The cooler temperatures gave firefighters on Monday a chance to attack the string of major wildfires across California, fire officials said. 
Another massive blaze, the Carr Fire, has blackened about 207,000 acres and killed eight people in and around Shasta County, north of Sacramento near the Oregon state line. It was 63 percent contained as of Monday afternoon, Cal Fire said.

In Southern California the Holy Fire, which authorities say was set on Aug. 6 by a disgruntled homeowner in an Orange County canyon, was 59 percent contained after torching more than 22,000 acres and destroying a dozen cabins.

Relations between the two NATO allies have spiraled into a full-blown crisis over the trial of Christian pastor Andrew Brunson, who was held for 21 months in a Turkish prison until his transfer to house arrest last month - a move Washington dismissed as insufficient.
The appeal document seen by Reuters said the court should halt any unlawful political interventions and lift judicial control provisions imposed on Andrew Brunson.
Brunson, who has been living in Turkey for more than two decades, was accused of helping supporters of Fethullah Gulen, the U.S.-based cleric who Turkish authorities say masterminded the 2016 coup attempt against President Tayyip Erdogan.
""The court should prevent unlawful political interventions by lifting judicial control provisions on the defendant,"" the document said.
Turkish lira plunged on concerns over the deepening rift between Washington and Ankara, hitting a record low of 7.24 against U.S. dollar and weakening some 45 percent so far this year.
The United States imposed sanctions on two Turkish ministers and doubled customs tariffs on Turkish aluminum and steel imports after Brunson was placed in house arrest.
Brunson's lawyer, Ismail Cem Halavurt, said the court had up to seven days to decide. Brunson, who faces up to 35 years in jail if found guilty, denies the charges.

May next year is the most recent deadline Prayuth's junta has set for an election its critics hope will return Thailand to civilian rule after more than four years of the military government, although it has repeatedly pushed back the timeline.
As army chief, Prayuth, 64, led a 2014 coup that ousted a civilian government to end a prolonged period of sometimes deadly unrest.
But he has shown signs of wanting to stay in power after next year's vote.
""If I will stay on, I will have to look at the law,"" Prayuth told reporters at Bangkok's Government House.
""In September you will know,"" he added, but gave no details.
His backers, including some veteran politicians, have made no secret of their support for Prayuth and want him to return as prime minister. 
Technically Prayuth cannot stand for election under the constitution, because he would have needed to have resigned from his post since 2017 to do so.
However, he could return as prime minister if a political party nominated him its frontrunner.
The military-backed constitution also offers Prayuth another route.
He could be chosen as an ""outside prime minister"" if the House of Representatives and the military-appointed upper house Senate nominate him if the winning party's candidate fails to get enough votes.
The junta, formally known as the National Council for Peace and Order, has promised to relax its curbs on political activities before the vote, to allow political parties to complete administrative tasks between September and December.

1311,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2018 05:59AM ET</span>","South Korea marks first 'comfort women' day, joined by protestors in Taiwan","By Joyce Lee and Yimou Lee
SEOUL/TAIPEI (Reuters) - People in South Korea and Taiwan unveiled monuments and staged protests on Tuesday to mark Japan's wartime use of ""comfort women"", a euphemism for girls and women forced to work in Japan's wartime brothels. 
In South Korea, a new monument was unveiled as part of its first ""Memorial Day for Japanese Forces' Comfort Women Victims,"" which threatens to exacerbate a sensitive diplomatic issue with Japan, South Korea's neighbor and a key ally of the United States in efforts to contain North Korea. 
""My hope is that this issue will not lead to a diplomatic dispute between South Korea and Japan. I also do not think that this will be solved by a bilateral diplomatic solution,"" South Korean President Moon Jae-in said in commemoration of the day.
Moon said the issue involves ""the entire world"" and human rights of women as a whole, and pledged the South Korean government will respect the women as the main parties of the issue, and pursue commemorative projects to restore their honor and dignity including discovery, preservation and propagation of records. 
Japan has said the issue was resolved by a 2015 deal, struck by a previous, conservative South Korean administration, under which Japan apologized to the victims and provided 1 billion yen ($9.03 million) to a fund to support them. 
But South Korean President Moon Jae-in's administration has spotlighted the emotionally-charged issue and has called for Japan to do more, despite backing down in January from formally renegotiating the deal. 
In March, Moon described Japan's wartime use of comfort women as ""crimes against humanity"", with Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga calling Moon's remarks ""extremely regrettable."" 
Tokyo has protested over other existing monuments in South Korea dedicated to comfort women, including one in front of the Japanese embassy in Seoul, as well as the move late last year to establish a day to remember comfort women. 
August 14 was chosen because on August 14, 1991, South Korean comfort woman victim Kim Hak-sun became the first to give a public testimony about her experience, according to the country's Ministry of Gender Equality and Family. 
A think-tank funded by the South Korean government devoted to researching the issue also opened earlier this month. 
The comfort women issue has been a regular cause for contention between Japan and neighbors including China and North and South Korea since the war. 
On Tuesday morning, over 50 activists joined a sit-in protest in front of Japan's de facto embassy in Taiwan's capital, Taipei, asking for a formal apology and demanding monetary compensation for Taiwanese who were forced to work in its wartime brothels. 
""Japanese government should apologize,"" the crowd shouted, wearing black shirts with their faces covered by white masks. 
A bronze statue symbolizing comfort women was also unveiled in the southern Taiwanese city of Tainan on Tuesday morning, according to Taiwan’s leading newspaper United Daily News. 
The unveiling, attended by former President Ma Ying-jeou, was organized by a local group and had nothing to do with the city government, an official from Tainan's Department of Information and International Relations told Reuters. 
Japan colonized the Korean peninsula between 1910 and 1945 and occupied parts of China before and after the war. 
Japan says the matter of compensation for the South Korean women was settled under a 1965 treaty. It says that in 2015, it agreed to provide the funds to help them heal ""psychological wounds"".

Ramaphosa, who replaced former president Jacob Zuma in February, has made the fight against corruption a key plank of his administration as he seeks to restore investor confidence after the scandal-plagued Zuma era.
The Special Investigating Unit (SIU), a state entity which probes malpractice in government, will look into hundreds of cases where state attorneys are accused of colluding with private lawyers to agree the settlement of fictitious claims.
""The investigation will help the Department of Justice to lay to rest concerns that have been raised,"" Justice Minister Michael Masutha told reporters.
""Where appropriate ... disciplinary action as well as criminal investigations will be initiated against alleged perpetrators to ensure that firm action is taken to uproot corrupt activities.""
In the health ministry, one of the departments worst affected by the alleged fraud, claims totaling 56 billion rand ($4 billion) will be investigated, Minister of Health Aaron Motsoaledi said at the same briefing.

FUKUSHIMA, Japan (Reuters) - A statue of a child wearing what appears to be a hazardous material suit unveiled near the site of a Japanese nuclear disaster has drawn a barrage of criticism from residents and forced the sculptor to apologize.
The 6.2-meter high statue, ""Sun Child"", was put up in the city of Fukushima, north of Tokyo, this month and shows a child in what appears to be a bright yellow ""hazmat"" suit holding a helmet in one arm.
On the child's chest is a radiation counter reading zero.
A major earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011, led to meltdowns at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant, the world's worst nuclear disaster since the Chernobyl accident in 1986.
Many thousands of people were displaced by leaking radiation and many have still been unable to return home.
Residents said the statue would only prolong the painful memories of an accident that seemed destined to forever link the name Fukushima with nuclear disaster.
""I don't think Fukushima will be able to escape from its tainted reputation, so I understand what the sculptor wanted to say,"" said Ikue Tsunoda.
""However, residents don't wear hazmat suits, so I think that was provocative,"" she said.
Sculptor Kenji Yanobe said he had worked on the theme of radioactivity since 1991, as a way of showing how difficult it was for humans to deal with nuclear power. 
He said he wanted to show the air was now safe - the child in is shown with the helmet off, and the counter on its chest points to zero, though he said he was sorry the work had disturbed people.
""I sincerely apologize to those who were upset by my artwork,"" Yanobe said in a statement on his website.
City officials sought to smooth over the controversy.
""The statue represents the future free from nuclear disaster,"" said Mariko Furukawa, manager of the city's Board of Education.
Some 18,000 people were killed by the 2011 earthquake, most of them by the tsunami waves that swept ashore.

A spokesman for Netanyahu had declined to comment on the meeting after it was first reported on Monday by Israel's Channel Ten News.
Egypt and the United Nations have been trying to mediate a long-term truce between Israel and Hamas, the Islamist group that rules Gaza, following a spike in cross-border violence in the past few months. 
The two leaders discussed the easing of an Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza, rehabilitation of its infrastructure and terms for a ceasefire, the Channel Ten report said. 
Asked on Israeli Army Radio whether he had known of the meeting, Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon replied ""Yes."" He added that ""everything that will happen in Gaza will be done with Egyptian mediation and involvement"". 
More than two million Palestinians are packed into the Gaza Strip, which is experiencing deep economic hardship. The World Bank has described the situation as a humanitarian crisis with shortages of water, electricity and medicine.
Citing security concerns, Israel and Egypt keep tight restrictions on their border crossings with Gaza, which have reduced the enclave's economy to a state of collapse. 
Israel says the blockade is intended to prevent weapons reaching Hamas and other Gaza militant groups that have launched hundreds of rockets across the border in the past few months, during which time Israel has also carried out dozens of air strikes, targeting what it said were Hamas sites.
At least 161 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli gunfire in weekly protests along the Israel-Gaza border that began on March 30, and one Israeli soldier has been killed by a Palestinian sniper.

YANGON, August 14 (Reuters) - Muslims in Buddhist-majority Myanmar usually keep a low profile for fear of intimidation, but Win Lae Phyu Sin, one of the community's rare bloggers on beauty care, has gone the other way.
The 19-year-old was the center of attraction at a recent launch of beauty products in Yangon, her striking multi-colored make-up offset by a long-sleeved green-and-white gown and matching hijab, a headscarf worn by some Muslim women.
""I don't regret my decision to wear the hijab,"" the blogger said. ""Our God opens many ways for me. Hijab is like a key for me. I can use it to go where I want to go, and do what I want."" 
Muslims, who make up about 5 percent of the nation of around 50 million, say they have not been able to open new mosques in decades and struggle to rent apartments from Buddhist landlords.
Systematic persecution of Muslims is growing in Myanmar, rights groups say, though world attention has focused on its stateless Rohingya Muslims, with the United Nations and aid groups saying more than 700,000 were driven into neighboring Bangladesh after an army crackdown last year.
But many Muslims of all ethnicities had been refused national identity documents, and denied access to some places of worship, Burma Human Rights Network said in a report last year.
For some of Win Lae Phyu Sin's students, her tutorials are not merely about applying eyeshadow and highlighter, but also about building confidence and pride in an identity constantly questioned by Buddhist fellow citizens.
""I saw her applying make-up while wearing the hijab and it's amazingly beautiful,"" said Hay Mann Aung, 20.
""I wanted to be as beautiful as her."" 
Win Lae Phyu Sin's effort to impart a cool, chic vibe to the image of Myanmar Muslims, deploying stylish clothes that match her hijabs, elaborate mascara, and eyeshadow layered in bold colors, has drawn admirers.
She has 6,000 followers on social media site Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and 600 students have attended more than 150 classes on the use of cosmetics run in a makeshift studio.
(For photo essay, click on https://reut.rs/2Oxv6wu)
CRITICISM
But her high profile has drawn criticism and even discrimination: a Buddhist woman who enrolled in her class backed out on discovering Win Lae Phyu Sin was Muslim. 
Some Facebook commenters have attacked her for being too flamboyant and using make-up, which conservative Muslims regard as taboo, but the blogger refuses to let critics waste her time.
""When people attack or criticize me outside and online, I choose to ignore them,"" she said. ""I have a lot of work to do.""
Her growing fame, fed by dozens of online make-up tutorials and events at shopping malls, has prompted trips to Myanmar's second largest city, Mandalay, and she plans to visit Kuala Lumpur, the capital of neighboring Malaysia.
Win Lae Phyu Sin started with tutorials on make-up filmed in a bedroom shared with her sister, posting them on Facebook before offering classes.
""After I graduated from high school, my boyfriend gave me make-up palettes as a present,"" she said. ""I didn't know how to use them so I Googled it and learned."" 
But acquiring professional expertise proved too expensive, so Win Lae Phyu Sin came up with the idea of six-hour sessions, aimed at regular ""girls like me"", that cost less than $25.
A year on, she brings to every lesson two bags packed with eyeliners, brushes and small mirrors for every student. At one recent session, she discussed skin types before handing out bottles of foundation and eyeshadow for students to try.
Win Lae Phyu Sin is undeterred by those who denigrate her for being a Muslim and wearing a hijab that exposes the face.
""'Don't you know you will go to hell if you do that? Why don't you take off the hijab during shooting?'"" she quoted some Facebook critics as asking.

But she added, ""I will keep on doing this, because this is my passion.""

A delegation including members of the U.S.-backed SDF, which controls roughly a quarter of Syria, held talks with Damascus this month in their first declared visit to the capital. 
The visits highlight efforts by the Kurdish-led authorities to open new channels to President Bashar al-Assad's government, as they seek to negotiate a political deal that keeps their autonomy within Syria.
Negotiations could also raise new questions for U.S. policy in Syria, where the U.S. military has deployed into SDF territory during the battle against Islamic State. 
The SDF is spearheaded by the Kurdish YPG militia, which has mostly avoided conflict with Assad and has said it aimed to secure Kurdish rights rather than topple the government. 
This has set them apart from rebel factions fighting to bring down Assad since 2011, which have now been defeated in much of the territory they once held.
The Syrian Democratic Council (SDC) went for new talks on decentralization and the constitution, co-chair Riad Darar said on Tuesday. 
The ""long dialogue"" included a proposal from Damascus for the de facto autonomous region to take part in the state's local elections next month, he told Reuters. 
The SDC insists on preserving its structure of governance and self-rule in any future elections, he said. ""The delegation from Qamishli decided it would return for more discussions.""
State officials tabled many issues that the SDC saw as premature, Darar added. ""We need to agree on service provision first and this could build trust between us and with the people."" 
The SDF seized swathes of land with U.S. help, though Washington opposes their ambitions of autonomy. The region they control spreads across much of northern and eastern Syria, rich in farmland, oil, and water.
Damascus says the U.S. forces are occupiers. For the first time, Assad said in May that he was ""opening doors"" for talks with the SDF, but also threatened force and said the Americans would leave one way or another.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Pro-China groups rallied outside Hong Kong's Foreign Correspondents' Club (FCC) on Tuesday over a speech by an independence activist that has riled Beijing and sparked debate about the viability of the city's freedoms. 
The invitation to Andy Chan, a founder of the Hong Kong National Party, drew strong criticism this month from China's Foreign Ministry which urged the club to cancel the speech. The FCC pressed on with the event.
A number of Reuters journalists are FCC members.
In his speech, Chan, dressed in a black suit and gray tie, said his ideals were no different than many of his fellow citizens in chasing ""the dream of democracy"".
""If Hong Kong were to become truly democratic, Hong Kong's sovereignty must rest with the people of Hong Kong,"" he said.
""China is, by its nature, an empire, a threat to all free peoples in the world,"" Chan added.
About 50 pro-China supporters rallied outside the historic FCC building, waving red China flags and denouncing Chan and the club through loudhailers as police looked on.
""He's a traitor,"" said protester Jimmy Tso, who wore a black cap and T-shirt emblazoned with a China flag.
""We want harmony in Hong Kong but people like him are trying to subvert China, backed by foreign forces,"" he said.
Around a dozen pro-independence activists with banners supporting Chan were blocked by police from getting near the club's main entrance and the pro-Beijing groups.
The FCC, which has a membership that includes local and international journalists, is known as a spirited institution fostering and defending free speech. 
""I won't change my stance,"" said Chan, 27, acknowledging his calls for independence had angered some Hong Kong democrats who fear Beijing will crack down on all opposition groups.
""Hong Kong faces national cleansing from China...We are on our own, and we are a nation that is quickly being annexed by China,"" he said.
Hong Kong's government said it deeply regretted the FCC's decision to host Chan.
""It is totally inappropriate and unacceptable for any person to openly promote and advocate the independence of Hong Kong,"" a government spokesman said.
""As such, it is also totally inappropriate and unacceptable for any organization to provide a public platform to espouse such views,"" the spokesman said.
DEBATE OVER FREEDOMS
Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law, states that the former British colony, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997, is an ""inalienable"" part of China.
But Hong Kong operates under a ""one country, two systems"" agreement that promises it a high degree of autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed in China.
The incident has opened a new battlefront over the city's relative freedoms compared with mainland China, as pro-establishment figures demand tough new national security laws.
The independence activists say separation from China would safeguard the city's freedoms from Beijing's tightening grip over politics, academia, the law and the media.
China's Foreign Ministry, which has an office in Hong Kong, this month urged the club to cancel the event.
Leung Chun-ying, a former Hong Kong chief executive who is now vice chairman of a leading advisory body to China's parliament, had criticized the FCC for hosting a ""secessionist"".
Leung said the club paid ""token rent"" to the government for its building in the central business district - comments that stoked concerns among some members about the FCC's future.
Leung did not respond to an emailed request for comment.
FCC vice president Victor Mallet said the club has over the years neither endorsed nor opposed the diverse views of speakers.
""The FCC does believe that its members, and the public at large, have the right ... to hear the views of different sides in any debate,"" Mallet said.

""We at the FCC, we fully respect the law and we champion free speech and freedom of the press across Asia,"" he said.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Up to 50 Chinese nationals have been detained in Cambodia as part of a crackdown on prostitution rings in Sihanoukville province, a Chinese investment hub, the provincial governor said on Tuesday.
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen is a close ally of Beijing and the Southeast Asian country has attracted a surge of Chinese investment in the capital, Phnom Penh, and cities like Sihanoukville, where the development of casinos and hotels has expanded rapidly.
Sihanoukville, a coastal city 225 km (140 miles) west of Phnom Penh, has seen a construction boom in recent years supported by a steady stream of Chinese money. 
However, the influx of Chinese workers and money has also stirred local resentment and what some authorities say is a rise in criminality in the once-sleepy port town.
Governor Yun Min said Chinese investment in the province had topped $1 billion but the money came with a rise in illegal sex services provided by and for Chinese nationals in the area.
""When a lot of them come, there are also a lot of demands for the service,"" Yun Min told Reuters.
""It is illegal in our country so we have to stop it and crack down,"" he said. ""The crackdown will continue indefinitely.""
China's embassy in Phnom Penh did not respond to an emailed request for comment.
Sihanoukville police chief Phul Phorsda said the crackdown was continuing but declined to comment further.
A police report obtained by Reuters said police had confiscated leaflets offering sex services, featuring naked women and phone numbers, during raids at massage parlors. 
China's support allowed Hun Sen to defy Western criticism of a crackdown on his opponents in the lead-up to a general election last month in which his ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) said it won all 125 parliamentary seats.
Official election results are expected on Wednesday.
The opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party was dissolved by a court last year at the request of Hun Sen's government, prompting condemnation from several Western countries.
Yun Min, who complained in a letter to the interior minister in January that the Chinese influx had pushed up crime in Sihanoukville, downplayed his earlier comments on Tuesday, saying that Chinese investment was positive on the whole.
""China has a lot of other good citizens, the 50 people in detention don't represent the whole Chinese population,"" he said.

Hundreds of people have been killed or wounded during clashes there since last week, and hard-pressed Afghan forces received air support from U.S. forces.
Residents who had fled the Ghazni city, the provincial capital, reported that the Taliban had cut telecommunications, electricity and water supplies, hospitals were running out medical supplies, while shops, homes and some government buildings had been destroyed.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A former provincial governor accused of sexual abuse in one of South Korea's most high-profile cases inspired by the ""MeToo"" movement was found not guilty by a Seoul district court on Tuesday, according Yonhap news agency.
An Hee-jung was a rising star in South Korea’s ruling party before he quit his post in March, just hours after an aide accused him of repeated sexual assault.
Police opened an investigation into the allegations, as the snowballing #MeToo movement rattled the country’s political establishment.
""I am sorry and ashamed, I have disappointed the citizens,"" An apologized to the public after the verdict on Tuesday, Yonhap reported.
Kim Ji-eun, An's former assistant, went on national TV to accuse him of sexually harassing and repeatedly assaulting her.
An’s office initially claimed that the sex was consensual, but just a few hours after the TV interview was aired, An took to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to announce he planned to resign as governor and retire from political life.
The ruling Democratic Party quickly moved to expel An from the party.
An was indicted in April on charges of abusing his authority and forcing sexual intercourse on Kim multiple times from July 2017 to February 2018.
In finding An not guilty, however, the court ruled that the case was ""between two adults with normal judgment"" and that ""the evidence presented by the prosecution is insufficient to substantiate the charges that his actions infringed on the victim's sexual freedom,"" according to Yonhap.

An became an unexpected challenger to Moon during last year’s presidential primaries, and his strong showing raised speculation he could emerge as a future leader. He was one of a number high-profile political, entertainment, and religious figures ensnared in South Korea's growing ""#MeToo"" campaign against sexual harassment and assault.

Newcastle Court Magistrate Robert Stone allowed Philip Wilson, 67, to serve his detention at home after an assessment by prison authorities due to a range of health issues, including heart disease, faced by the former archbishop.
Wilson was ordered to begin serving his detention on Tuesday in New South Wales state and would be eligible for parole in February 2019, the court said, without disclosing the address of where he would be held.
Australian Broadcasting Corp. Television showed Wilson being driven away from the court in Newcastle, about 170 km (105 miles) north of Sydney. It said he would be staying at his sister's house.
Wilson has said he planned to appeal against his conviction for failing to disclose to police abuse by a priest, Father James Fletcher, after being told about it in 1976 by two victims.
Wilson resigned as archbishop of Adelaide in July, two months after being convicted. He wanted to hold on to the position until he completed his appeal but came under pressure from Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, fellow clerics and abuse victims to quit.

The Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, the country's top Catholic body that Wilson once led, had no immediate comment on his sentencing to home detention.

GYODONG ISLAND, South Korea (Reuters) - Retired South Korean farmer Hwang Rae-ha would love to see his mother again, but nearly 70 years after he last set eyes on her, he says he would settle for a photograph. 
""Too much time has passed by, and it is over now,"" he told Reuters, standing near his home within sight of the North Korean border. ""I don’t think she is alive.""
During the Korean War, which raged up and down the peninsula for three years, Hwang's family fled here to Gyodong Island, in what is now South Korea.
But his mother returned to their home in the North to prepare for a hoped for peace and was caught on the northern side of the heavily fortified border that divided the two Koreas after the 1953 armistice.
Hwang, now 77, stayed on Gyodong Island, even building a home within sight of North Korea, hoping one day his mother would return.
So far, there has only been silence.
With tensions on the Korean peninsula easing, North and South Korea plan to revive the cross-border family reunions that were halted three years ago as concerns over Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs mounted.
More than 57,000 South Korean survivors are registered with the South Korean government, hoping for a shot at a brief meeting with loved ones.
Just 93 South Koreans and 88 North Koreans have been selected for a new round of reunions that will begin on August 20 at a resort in North Korea's Mt Kumgang, a popular tourist region.
""I still cry whenever I talk about my family, I will probably cry again once I see them,"" said 82-year-old Bae Soon-hui, who was picked to meet her sisters for the first time since the war. ""I was utterly in shock after hearing that I was selected."" 
AGING SURVIVORS
Hwang, the retired farmer, was not one of the few picked for this new round of meetings.
""When can we meet our loved ones?"" he asked. ""After all of us are dead? 100 people per each event is just meaningless. There are 50,000 people waiting all over the country.""
His question is not entirely rhetorical.
Since 1988, 132,484 South Koreans have added their names to a government registry, hoping to reunite with their families. 
But survivors of the war are aging rapidly, and 75,425 people on that list have already died, the vast majority without ever having seen their relatives again.
In a decade, most of the survivors - already in their 80s or 90s - will have died, said Cheong Seong-chang, Vice President of Research Planning at Seoul's Sejong Institute.
""That is why the state-run reunion program is a matter of urgency, an extremely pressing matter,"" he said.
Park Kyung-sun, 81, who lives in Goyang city near the North Korean border, didn't want to wait on the government.
During a period of closer relations in the 2000s she unsuccessfully searched for her family during three tightly controlled tours in North Korea, once glimpsing her old home briefly from the window of a tour bus.
""All I wanted was to tell my mom how I lived, but she is dead now,"" Park said. ""I miss my brothers. It’s so hurtful leaving them behind.""
A LIFETIME OF TRAUMA
For many survivors the reunions offer the first details of their family's fate following the war that left more than 1.2 million dead.
""I will probably ask them how they have been, and when mother died,"" Bae said of her sisters. ""That’s what I want to know."" 
South and North Korea first agreed to hold reunions after a historic inter-Korea summit in 2000. The reunions were held every year until 2015.
Over that period, 2,046 people were picked by a computer which prioritizes them on factors including their age and family background.
Others are selected when their relatives in the North request a meeting.
""I could not believe it at first, I thought I was being scammed,"" said Kim Hyun-sook, 91, describing her shock when her daughter and granddaughter in North Korea asked to meet her in 2015.
Many of those selected, however, say being torn away after seeing their relatives for only a few hours under the watchful eye of North Korean guards is a traumatic experience.
""When the time was up, I let go of my daughter’s hand, and went to the bus,"" Kim said. ""The moment I sat down, I could not speak.""
Kim said she wants to see her family again before she dies, but with North Korea still largely cut off from the rest of the world and those who have already had reunions ruled out of the selection process, that seems increasingly unlikely.

“She is alive, and I can’t see her anymore for the rest of my life, can you even imagine that?”

1327,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 07:11PM ET</span>","As Canada faces rising gun violence, tighter laws are a tough sell","By Anna Mehler Paperny
TORONTO (Reuters) - Rising violence in Canada has prompted calls for the federal government to tighten gun laws but tougher regulations could cause a political backlash in a country where 2 million people are licensed to own a firearm.
In 2016, 223 people were murdered with a gun, a 23 percent increase from 2015 and the highest rate since 2005, according to Statistics Canada.
One of the deadliest shooting sprees so far this year took place on Friday when four people were shot to death in the Eastern Canadian city of Fredericton. Weeks earlier, a gunman opened fire on a bustling Danforth Avenue in Toronto, killing two and injuring 13 before turning the gun on himself.
In Fredericton, a commonly available ""long gun"" such as a rifle or shotgun was used, police said Monday, adding that the suspect had a permit to use it. In Toronto the gunman used a handgun. It is not clear how the suspects obtained the guns.
Canada's firearm homicide rate of 0.61 per 100,000 people is about 10 times greater than the rate in the United Kingdom. In the United States, by contrast, four in every 100,000 residents are killed with a gun, or almost 13,000 annually.
Canada's federal government introduced gun laws earlier this year that would require retailer record-keeping and beef up background checks. The government is open to considering tougher ones after Toronto called for a ban on handguns in the wake of the Danforth shooting, said Bill Blair, the minister charged with tackling gun violence.
""We're prepared to look at any measure that will reduce gun violence,"" he said in an interview, adding that ""it's a vast country and the way in which guns are viewed in Toronto is different than they might be viewed in different municipalities or communities.""
The bill has passed second reading and is likely to pass in the House of Commons, where Liberals hold a majority, but may face headwinds in the Senate.
But any move by the Liberal government to more heavily regulate ownership could prompt a backlash by the opposition Conservatives, who tend to do well in rural areas where hunting is popular and many farmers have guns. 
Canada requires residents to obtain a license and pass a safety course to buy a gun. According to the Firearms Commissioner, more than 2 million people have such licenses in a country of 36 million.
There is a national registry of handguns and other restricted and prohibited guns. The government ended a similar registry for long guns such as rifles in 2012 due to its unpopularity with gun owners and conservative voters.
Under proposed legislation, retailers would keep records of everyone who buys a long gun.
The National Firearms Association, a lobby group similar to the U.S. National Rifle Association but with less clout, said it would campaign against the Liberals' proposed legislation, which the Conservatives said ""treat law-abiding firearms owners as criminals"" because of the background checks and requirements for record-keeping.
National Firearms Association Executive Vice President Blair Hagen said his group, which has 150,000 members, has been in touch with the opposition Conservative party and hopes to make gun control an election issue. 
""It's one of those flashpoint issues,"" he said Monday. ""As soon as you touch that third rail, you're setting yourself up for a very, very serious political fallout.""
The Liberals criticized the former Conservative government’s 2012 move to scrap a registry of shotguns and rifles but the issue became so politically toxic that the party has promised not to bring it back. ""That is not part of our plan and has never been,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters in Prince Edward Island Monday.
The registry's elimination left a crucial gap when it comes to tracking guns, says Wayne Rideout, a former Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officer now working with the British Columbia government to tackle gun crime. 
Now, someone with a license buying a rifle ""can buy 10 guns, 20 guns, 100 guns and they don’t know who you are, they don’t keep a record,"" he said in an interview.

""There's a number of broken pieces in the chain that need to be fixed.""

TORONTO (Reuters) - Ontario's newly elected conservative government said on Monday it will delay the start date of recreational marijuana sales in the province and will allow private retailers to sell cannabis rather than government-run stores. 
Ontario will allow private retailers to sell recreational marijuana starting on April 1, officials from the province's Progressive Conservative government told a news conference, abandoning its predecessor's plans for government-controlled stores starting on Oct. 17.
While Canada will be the first Group of Seven nation to legalize recreational cannabis in October, it has chosen to make a cautious start. Many provincial governments, including the previous Liberal government in Ontario, have planned a small number of stores to start with and tight control over supply.
Ontario's new conservative Premier Doug Ford, however, prefers a more laissez-faire approach and had hinted at a shift to a private retail model before his election in June. In March, he told CBC Radio he did not believe in ""the government sticking their hands in our lives all the time.""
The province will begin consultations with several groups including businesses, consumer groups, municipalities and law enforcement next week and will examine the retail models planned by Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, Ontario Attorney General Caroline Mulroney said at the news conference. 
Between October and April, cannabis will be available only online, Ontario Finance Minister Vic Fedeli said at the news conference, which was broadcast by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. 
""The system we’re proposing marks a significant departure from the approach of the previous government,"" Fedeli said. ""Implementing this new approach will take time."" 
The initial Liberal government plan was for 40 stores across Ontario in the first year, rising to 150 by the end of 2020 - all run by the provincial liquor board.
Fedeli and Mulroney did not say how many retail licenses will be issued or whether any of the multitudes of illegal dispensaries that currently operate will be able to apply, but added that more details will be released as the consultation advances.
The province will remain the wholesaler to retailers under the new framework, similar to the previous one. 
Fedeli emphasized that safety and prevention of sales to underaged users will remain paramount. 

""If a private retailer is caught selling cannabis to any underage buyer even once, their license is done,"" he said. ""And for those engaged in the underground today, our message is simple: stop.""

""At the Turkish ambassador's request, Ambassador John Bolton met with Ambassador Serdar Kilic of Turkey (on Monday) in the White House. They discussed Turkey's continued detention of Pastor Andrew Brunson and the state of the U.S.-Turkey relationship,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said.
U.S. officials said no deadline had been set for Brunson's release, contradicting some media reports. Brunson is accused of backing a coup attempt against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan two years ago, charges that he has denied.
""The fact that there's ongoing discussions between the two countries regarding Brunson's return to the U.S. is positive,"" said Jay Sekulow, an attorney for U.S. President Donald Trump who is also representing Brunson's family. ""I look forward to the Brunson family returning to the U.S.""
Relations between NATO allies Turkey and the United States are at a low point, hurt by Brunson's detention, as well as diverging interests in Syria. Trump doubled tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminum imports last week, contributing to a precipitous fall in the lira.
U.S. officials have given no indication that the United States has been prepared to give any ground over the Brunson issue, with Trump seemingly content to keep up economic pressure.
The United States is also considering a fine against Turkey's state-owned Halkbank for allegedly helping Iran evade U.S. sanctions. Earlier this month, the United States imposed sanctions on two top officials in Erdogan's cabinet in an attempt to get Turkey to turn over Brunson.
Last week, Trump tweeted that ""our relations with Turkey are not good at this time!""
White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said the Trump administration was carefully monitoring the financial situation in Turkey after its currency fell to a record low against the U.S. dollar on Monday. 

""We're monitoring it very closely. Treasury Secretary (Steven) Mnuchin is monitoring it very closely,"" Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told MSNBC.

More than two dozen witnesses painted a picture of Manafort, 69, as a lavish spender with little regard for the law. A political consultant in the Ukraine, Manafort stashed his money in 31 undisclosed offshore bank accounts, and skirted taxes on that income by wiring it directly to vendors to snap up real estate, bespoke suits, cars and antique rugs, the witnesses said.

1331,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 04:39PM ET</span>","Tunisian president proposes inheritance equality for women, with exceptions","TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia's president on Monday proposed giving women equal inheritance rights despite protests from thousands of people objecting to any challenge to Islamic law.
The North African Muslim country, which toppled autocrat Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in 2011, grants women more rights than other countries in the region, and since last year has allowed Muslim women to marry non-Muslim men.
But in a show how divided society remains, thousands demonstrated on Saturday in front of parliament against any changes to inheritance rules.
The current system is based on Islamic law which typically allows men to inherit double what a woman would receive.
""I propose equality inheritance to become law,"" President Beji Caid Essebsi said in a speech.
But in the face of the opposition from conservatives, he left the door open for some exceptions, saying families who wished to continue the allocation based on Islamic law would be able to do so.
Parliament now needs to decide on a bill.
Thousands of women and men rallied in central Tunis in the evening to demand a law granting women equal heritage rights.
Tunisia is ruled by a coalition of moderate Islamists and secular forces which have been managing its democratic transition since 2011, avoiding the upheaval seen in Egypt, Libya or Syria.
They had agreed in 2014 on a constitution granting far-reaching political rights, limiting the role of religion and holding free elections, which stands out in a region often run by autocrats.
But one of the few areas where the Islamists have resisted change is the inheritance law.
To break the standoff Essebsi, a secular politician, had in August 2017 set up a committee to draft proposals to advance women’s rights, winning praise from secular-minded women.

While Tunisia has been hailed as the only ""Arab spring"" success story economic growth has been disappointing, however, with high unemployment driving many young Tunisians abroad who had joined the uprising.

1332,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>",UK Labour's Corbyn trades barbs with Netanyahu on Mideast violence,"(Reuters) - A furor over alleged anti-semitism in Britain's main opposition party widened on Monday when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn exchanged accusations on Twitter over Israeli-Palestinian bloodshed.
Labour has been wrestling accusations of anti-semitism for months, and Corbyn has previously apologized for what he has described as ""pockets"" of anti-semitism in the organization.
Britain's right-leaning Daily Mail on Friday reported that Corbyn, on a visit to Tunisia in 2014, had laid a wreath at the graves of members of a Palestinian group that killed 11 Israeli athletes and a German policeman at the 1972 Munich Olympics.
It said the cemetery houses a memorial to the dozens killed in the 1985 Israeli bombing of the Palestine Liberation Organisation headquarters in exile in Tunis, as well as the graves of members of Black September, a PLO splinter group that carried out the Munich attack.
It published a photograph it said showed Corbyn standing near the graves of Black September members.
Labour said Corbyn, a staunch supporter of the Palestinian cause, was in Tunis to honor the victims of the 1985 raid.
Unimpressed, Netanyahu said in a tweet: 
""The laying of a wreath by Jeremy Corbyn on the graves of the terrorists who perpetrated the Munich massacre and his comparison of Israel to the Nazis deserves unequivocal condemnation from everyone – left, right and everything in between.""
Corbyn responded: ""Netanyahu's claims about my actions and words are false. What deserves unequivocal condemnation is the killing of over 160 Palestinian protesters in Gaza by Israeli forces since March, including dozens of children.""
The Labour Party said Corbyn did not lay a wreath at the graves of anyone linked to Black September and he condemned the Munich attack. Corbyn however told reporters on Monday: ""I was present when (a wreath) was laid, I don't think I was involved in it,"" adding that the visit was a peace-seeking exercise.
Despite deep divisions in the Conservative government as it negotiates Britain's exit from the European Union, Labour's poll standing appears to have been damaged by the anti-semitism row.

A YouGov poll last week showed that 39 percent of those asked would vote for the Conservatives, a gain of one point for May's party compared to last week when the two biggest parties were level. Labour dropped three points to 35 percent.

Robert Kyagulanyi, a popular independent who is an outspoken critic of President Yoweri Museveni, said the shooting happened while he was canvassing for his preferred candidate.
""Police has shot my driver dead thinking they've shot at me,"" Kyagulanyi, known as Bobi Wine, said on Twitter, where he also posted a picture of a vehicle in which a man in blood-soaked clothing was slumped in the driver's seat.
Reuters could not immediately verify the content of the picture or the circumstances under which it was taken.
Police spokesman Emirian Kayima declined to comment on the allegation that police had shot the driver, and said authorities were still gathering details about the incident.
""Police are handling a riotous situation in that area right now. We're still gathering details of what happened and we will share when we have them,"" Kayima said.
Kyagulanyi also said in his Twitter post that police and the military had cordoned off his hotel in Arua, some 350 km (220 miles) from the capital Kampala.
Since he joined parliament last year, Kyagulanyi has gained in popularity through his often biting criticism of Museveni's government, which at times he expresses through his music. 
Government officials see his appeal, especially to young people, as a threat to Museveni's hold on power which is fraying due to public anger over deteriorating public services, corruption and rights abuses.
Critics say Museveni is set for a life presidency after parliament last year removed an age cap from the constitution that would have barred him from seeking re-election in 2021.

The mostly African workers had been paying up to 200 euros ($230) a month to live in the building, which had been sub-divided into small rooms with beds.
The farm near the capital ""was illegally housing over 110 foreign workers in inhumane conditions... The shower and lavatory facilities were a health hazard,"" Planning Authority official Charles Gafa said.
The migrants said they had reached Malta by ferry from Italy. Some told local reporters they were moving in with friends but about 80 said they had nowhere to stay and were asking for help.
The planning authority said it would ensure the farm was no longer used to house migrants.
The Aditus foundation, a Maltese rights charity, called for an investigation. 
It said there had been repeated reports of ""severe labor exploitation of migrant workers in the agriculture sector, at times amounting to forced labor, slavery and trafficking for labor exploitation.""

A spokesman for Netanyahu declined to comment on the report and there was no immediate comment from Egyptian officials. Channel Ten, citing unnamed senior U.S. officials, said the meeting was held on May 22. 
Egypt and the United Nations have been trying to mediate a long-term truce between Israel and Hamas, the Islamist group that rules Gaza, following a spike in cross-border violence in the past few months.
The two leaders discussed the easing of an Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza, rehabilitation of its infrastructure and terms for a ceasefire, the report said. 
More than 2 million Palestinians are packed into the Gaza Strip, which is experiencing deep economic hardship. The World Bank has described the situation as a humanitarian crisis with shortages of water, electricity and medicine.
Citing security concerns, Israel and Egypt keep tight restrictions on their border crossings with Gaza, which have reduced the enclave's economy to a state of collapse. 
Israel says the blockade is intended to prevent weapons reaching Hamas and other Gaza militant groups who have launched hundreds of rockets across the border in the past few months, during which time Israel has also carried out dozens of air strikes, targeting what it said were Hamas sites.

At least 161 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli gunfire in weekly protests along the Israel-Gaza border that began on March 30, and one Israeli soldier has been killed by a Palestinian sniper.

(Reuters) - A Florida man was charged with manslaughter on Monday for fatally shooting another man on July 19 during an argument over a parking spot, after police initially declined to arrest him due to the state's ""stand your ground"" self-defense law, officials said.
Alleged shooter Michael Drejka was taken into custody on Monday, the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. The suspect was 47 at the time of the crime but turned 48 last week, according to the county jail.
Police had initially not charged Drejka over the July 19 shooting due to the 2005 law, which grants residents the right to use deadly force if they reasonably believe they are at risk of great harm or death. The case was sent to the state attorney's office for further review. 
""I support the state attorney's decision and will have no further comment as the case continues to work its way through the criminal justice system,"" said Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri in a statement on Monday.
The shooting occurred when Drejka got involved in a shouting match outside a Clearwater, Florida, grocery store with a woman who allegedly parked in a spot reserved for handicapped people without the proper permit, the sheriff's office said.
The woman's boyfriend, 28-year-old Markeis McGlockton, approached Drejka and shoved him to the ground, at which point Drejka drew his licensed concealed handgun and shot McGlockton in the chest while his girlfriend and 5-year-old son were inside the store, the sheriff's office said. It said that Drejka said he was in fear for his life at the time.
Surveillance video of the event went viral online, sparking criticism of the ""stand your ground"" law on social media. The fact that alleged shooter Drejka is white and victim McGlockton was black also sparked charges that way the law is applied ignored racially-fueled crimes. 
The law removed the legal responsibility to retreat from a dangerous situation and allowed the use of deadly force when a person felt greatly threatened. It inspired similar laws in other states and was cited as a factor in the fatal 2012 shooting of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin by a volunteer neighborhood watch member.
Backers of ""stand your ground"" laws say they deter crime.
It was not immediately clear if Drejka had retained a lawyer or if he remained in custody on Monday afternoon.

Clearwater is located on Florida's Gulf Coast, about 20 miles (32 km) west of Tampa.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - At least 40 people were killed by paramilitary forces in eastern Ethiopia over the weekend, a senior regional official said on Monday, in the latest spate of violence driven by ethnic divisions.
Unrest first broke out along the border of the country's Somali and Oromiya provinces in September, displacing nearly a million people, though the violence had subsided by April. 
On Monday, the Oromiya regional administration's spokesman Negeri Lencho said heavily armed members of a paramilitary force from the Somali region had carried out cross-border attacks in Oromiya's East Hararghe district.
""We still do not know why Liyu forces raided the areas on Saturday and Sunday,"" he said, referring to the paramilitary soldiers. ""But we know that all the victims were ethnic Oromos. At least 40 were killed in the attacks.""
A week earlier, mobs looted properties owned by ethnic minorities in the Somali region's capital Jijiga. The central government said the unrest had been stoked by regional officials who had fallen out with central authorities trying to address rights abuses in the region.
The spokesman said the officials had said the government was illegally forcing them to resign, and that Liyu forces had taken part in the attacks under their orders.
The forces are seen as loyal to the region's leader Abdi Mohammed Omer, who has since resigned.
Authorities in the Somali region were not immediately available for comment.
Ethnic violence has spread in the diverse country of 100 million people, where anti-government protests broke out in the Oromiya region over land rights in 2015. Hundreds were killed by security forces over a two-year period.
The violence is the biggest domestic challenge facing reformist prime minister Abiy Ahmed, who took office in April.
In a separate incident, a stampede among thousands who attended a visit by a prominent political activist in the town of Shashemene killed three people on Sunday, officials from the Oromiya regional government said.
The event was held to mark the return to Ethiopia of Jawar Mohammed, an activist who had been in exile in the United States but played a key role in mobilizing Oromo youths through social media.
Amid the chaos, another person was beaten to death by a mob after rumors circulated he had carried a bomb, residents said. ""Police did not take action while all that took place,"" the witness told Reuters. ""It is an example of the lawlessness that is taking root in the country.""

Peter Beinart, a contributing editor at The Atlantic and a columnist at the liberal Jewish Forward daily, said on Twitter that he had been detained at Israel's Ben Gurion airport when he arrived for a family visit on Sunday.
In an article in The Forward, Beinart said he was taken into a room at the airport and questioned by an Israeli security official on the reasons for his visit.
""Then the political questions began. Was I involved in any organization that could provoke violence in Israel? I said no. Was I involved in any organization that threatens Israel democracy? I said no — that I support Israeli organizations that employ non-violence to defend Israeli democracy,"" he wrote.
Beinart said he was also questioned about a protest he had attended during a previous visit, in the Palestinian city of Hebron in the occupied West Bank. He was released after about an hour, he said.
A few hours after Beinart Tweeted about the incident, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office released an English statement which said:
""Prime Minister Netanyahu heard of Mr. Beinart's questioning at Ben Gurion airport and immediately spoke with Israel's security forces to inquire how this happened. He was told it was an administrative mistake,"" the statement said.
""Israel is an open society which welcomes all – critics and supporters alike. Israel is the only country in the Middle East where people voice their opinions freely and robustly,"" the statement said.

Speaking at a joint press conference with his Yemeni counterpart, President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi also said Cairo was committed to helping Yemen regain its security after more than three years of war that has killed thousands of people.
""We categorically reject that Yemen would become a foothold for the influence of non-Arab forces, or a platform for security and stability threats against the brotherly Arab countries or freedom of navigation in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandab Strait,"" Sisi said, speaking alongside President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.
Last month, Saudi Arabia temporarily halted oil shipments through Bab al-Mandab citing security concerns after Iran-aligned Yemen's Houthis attacked two oil tankers in the Red Sea near the strait with missiles, damaging one vessel.
Although Saudi Arabia resumed oil shipments through the strait several days later, the incident has highlighted the volatility of the situation in the area, where fighting between the Houthis and supporters of Hadi's government has been raging since 2015.
Yemen lies along the southern end of the Red Sea, one of the most important trade routes in the world for oil tankers. The tankers pass near Yemen's shores while heading from the Middle East through the Suez Canal to Europe.
Speaking after talks with Hadi in Cairo, Sisi said Egypt supported the internationally-recognized Yemeni government and was committed to helping it restore stability to the country.
Egypt, the most populous country in the Arab world, is a member of the Saudi-led coalition which intervened in Yemen's civil war in 2015 to try to restore Hadi to power against what it sees as Iranian support for the Houthis.
But its role has been mainly to patrol Bab al-Mandab with naval vessels.
Hadi said he had briefed Sisi on what he called Iranian support for the Houthis in endangering security in the Red Sea.
""We discussed the dangers that the Red Sea had been exposed to because of the terrorism of the Houthi militias and its supporter, Iran, which aims not only to impact Red Sea security but Arab national security as a whole,"" Hadi said.

Iran denies providing military support to the Houthis.

The comments were picked up on by Chilean media at the weekend, sparking a wave of criticism from politicians on the left and right, and calls by Chilean actors, writers and musicians for Rojas to resign. 
Rojas, who made the comments in a book he co-authored that discussed his move from the left side of the political spectrum to the right, said on Twitter on Saturday that those comments did not reflect his current view, and that he had ""never diminished nor justified unacceptable, systematic and grave human rights violations that happened in Chile."" 
The scandal represents a fresh headache for Pinera, who has seen his approval ratings fall amid a series of gaffes by his ministers, coupled with continuing high unemployment figures. Last week, just five months into his term, he removed three ministers in a reshuffle. 
Pinera rejected Rojas' comments about the museum. 
""In the best interests of our country, for the wellbeing of all our compatriots and the good functioning of our government, I have decided to accept his resignation,"" he said. 
He said that Rojas' replacement will be Consuelo Valdes, an archeologist. 
An estimated 3,000 people disappeared or lost their lives during the Pinochet dictatorship, and 28,000 were tortured.

1342,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 01:06PM ET</span>","Low turnout in Mali election due to security fears, opposition charges fraud","By Tiemoko Diallo
BAMAKO (Reuters) - Voters stayed away in droves from Mali's run-off presidential election due to fears over security and simple apathy, but the voting process was generally fair despite a number of incidents, election monitors said on Monday.
The vote pitted President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita against opposition leader Soumaila Cisse after an inconclusive first round last month, when Keita won about 41 percent of the vote.
Official second-round results are not expected for a few days but Keita - known as IBK - is predicted to seal a second term in office.
Cisse, who had accused the government camp of cheating in the first round, on Monday again alleged fraud and said he had won.
""We have a large lead. We do not accept that our voice is stolen,"" he told a news conference in the capital Bamako.
Threats by jihadist militants forced nearly 500 polling stations - about two percent of the total - to stay closed during Sunday's run-off, the government said. One election official was killed in northern Niafunke, in Timbuktu region. 
Security fears severely dampened the turnout, which a civil society group, the Mali Citizen Observation Pool (POCIM) estimated at just over 27 percent of the eight million registered voters. Turnout is usually about 40 percent in Malian elections. 
Mali is high on the list of Western powers' security concerns due to the presence of militant groups with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State. A successful election is seen as vital in the effort to restore stability as the government tackles the resurgent Islamist threat and outbreaks of ethnic strife. 
The vast nation is also a main transit route for illegal migrants trying to reach Europe, a concern in European Union capitals.
As votes were being counted on Monday, Cisse, who heads the Union for the Republic and Democracy (URD) party, called on his supporters to challenge Keita's expected victory.
""We will not accept that a president wins through fraud. And we will show that there is fraud,"" he said. ""This fight is in your hands, dear supporters... Let's get engaged to save Mali""
But Mohamed Dileita, head of an observation mission from the Paris-based OIF, a federation of French-speaking nations, said: ""Everyone has more or less accepted the verdict... the vote took place.""
""At the time I speak, at least, it is a calm election, credible. At the moment we do not see any reason why it changes,"" Dileita told Radio France Internationale.
Mali's constitutional court rejected Cisse's claims of fraud in the first round, held on July 29.
LACK OF ENTHUSIASM
Most of the shuttered polling stations were in the Timbuktu region and the conflict-hit central region of Mopti, Security Minister Salif Traore told reporters.
In 2013 French troops pushed Islamist militants out of areas they had seized in the desert north, but they have since regrouped and routinely attack civilians, Malian soldiers and U.N. peacekeepers. 
Thousands of troops had been deployed across Mali to protect voters on Sunday after widespread violence in the first round. 
POCIM said in its report: ""Voters did not mobilize much to fulfill their civic duty.""
""The reasons given relate to the security problem and the lack of enthusiasm following the publication of the results of the first round.""
POCIM estimated turnout in the capital Bamako at just 26 percent, while in northern Timbuktu, which was in the hands of jihadists just five years ago, it was 40 percent. Turnout in Mopti was 24 percent.
It reported isolated incidents of ballot stealing and attacks on polling stations, including two which were torched.
A report by an EU observer mission will be important for the credibility of the election, though it was not clear on Monday when it would be published.

On Sunday the EU mission said the voting had passed peacefully for the most part, although it had no monitors in Mopti, Kidal and Timbuktu regions due to the security threat.

Trump said the former ""The Apprentice"" contestant had begged for a job in the White House but was hated by others, missed work and was ""nasty."" Still, he said he directed his chief of staff, John Kelly, to try to smooth things over with her.
""When Gen. Kelly came on board he told me she was a loser & nothing but problems. I told him to try working it out, if possible, because she only said GREAT things about me - until she got fired!"" he wrote in a series of posts on Twitter.
Ahead of the Tuesday release of her book ""Unhinged,"" which describes her time in the White House, Omarosa - known commonly by her first name - has released recordings of conversations she had with Kelly and Trump when she was fired in December. 
The White House has pushed back, saying the recordings raise questions about her integrity. Spokeswoman Sarah Sanders on Sunday also said the recordings, including one in the White House's secure Situation Room, showed ""a blatant disregard for our national security.""
Asked if she was concerned about any legal consequences, Omarosa told NBC's ""Today"" program: ""No, absolutely not."" 
She was previously best known for repeatedly being fired on NBC's ""The Apprentice"" and was one of Trump's more visible African-American supporters during his 2016 election campaign.

""It's sad that with all the things that's going on in the country that he would take time out to insult me and to insult my intelligence,"" she told MSNBC in reaction to Trump's tweets. ""This is his pattern with African-Americans, and he doesn't know how to control himself.""

1344,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>",Cuba's proposed new constitution: what will change,"By Marc Frank
HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba has begun a public debate on issues ranging from one-party rule and socialism to inequality, gay rights, private property and restructuring of the country's government as it moves to replace a Cold War-era constitution. 
A Communist Party-proposed overhaul of the island's 1976 Magna Carta will be discussed in 35,000 workplaces and community meetings into November after its recent approval by the Parliament. Once the debate is wrapped up, the legislature will approve a new draft and submit it to a nationwide vote early next year.
The proposed version of the constitution in part codifies changes in Cuban society that have occurred since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, long the country's benefactor, and in part modifies how the nation will function in the future.
Here are the basics of how the new version would transform Cuba, how open the process really is, and what it means for investors.
COMMUNISM
The new version keeps the Communist Party as the only legal party and its role as the guide of the nation, stating this is irrevocable. Yet, it eliminates a reference in the current constitution to reaching a utopian communism and another banning the use of private property to exploit the labor of others. 
SOCIALISM
The new version doubles down on the state's dominance over the means of production and land and the role of centralized planning. This too is deemed irrevocable. Still, for the first time there it recognizes the market as a fact of economic life, though it can be countermanded at will by the government. 
GOVERNMENT
An appointed prime minister has been added at the national level to supervise the day-to-day operations of the government, in particular the state-owned economy.
REGIONS
Provincial assemblies modeled after the national assembly are eliminated in the new version and replaced by an appointed governor and deputy governor. The governor will preside over a provincial council made up of municipal leaders.
MUNICIPALITIES
Terms of ward delegates to municipal assemblies are doubled to five years. The position of mayor has been added to that of president of the municipal assembly.
PRIVATE BUSINESS AND FOREIGN INVESTMENT
Private businesses and non-farm cooperatives are included for the first time in the new version as legitimate economic activity, and the role of joint ventures and other forms of foreign investment are upgraded from secondary to ""important"" or ""fundamental."" At the same time the ""accumulation"" of private property by citizens is banned. 
LGTB RIGHTS 
All prohibitions of discrimination in the new version add gender identity and the clause on marriage now refers to “persons” rather than man and woman.
LEGAL RIGHTS
The new version adds the presumption of innocence in criminal cases and the right to habeas corpus. For the first time a person can sue the state for damages and negligence. However, the judicial system remains unchanged and all lawyers are government employees.
OPPOSITION DOUBTS
Government opponents have blasted the top down process as a ""fraud"" and say the proposals will be pushed through with few substantive changes.
They question whether citizens will be free to speak their minds on issues such as one-party rule and capitalism versus socialism in a land where public debate on these subjects is taboo. 
BOTTOM LINE
The proposals do not by themselves reduce risk or change the rules of doing business in Cuba, but they do further foreign investment and are another step toward a mixed economy and modern society, foreign businessmen and diplomats said.

Cuban officials say changes in government structure aim to improve accountability and administration of the state-run economy.

ON BOARD THE OPEN ARMS, Mediterranean (Reuters) - The wreck of the raft was a dot on the sea but as our rescue boat approached we saw a woman make an effort to wave, so at least there was life.
Once speed boats launched from the Open Arms drew alongside, though, it was clear she was the only survivor. The woman, who gave her name as Josepha, was brought aboard in a state of deep shock and treated by doctors.
We found her early on July 17 and she told the doctors she had spent the previous night clinging to the wreckage, singing hymns and calling on God for deliverance. Two doctors recounted her story to me.
Face down amid the raft's mass of loose planks and deflated rubber lay the corpse of a woman in a striped T-shirt and trousers. She had been dead for some time, medics said.
Then there was a four-year-old boy, who the boat's doctors said had died hours before.
The crew lifted the two bodies onto the Open Arms, covered them and put them on ice on deck. The crew's emotions swung from a sense of accomplishment at the rescue to sadness.
I spent 29 days taking pictures on the flagship rescue boat of Spanish charity Proactiva Open Arms as it patrolled the designated Search and Rescue zone off the coast of Libya. Click here for a photo essay - https://reut.rs/2vAi36G.
In that time, we saw no other rescue boats and the crew said there were none active in the zone. Reuters was unable to verify this.
The rescue was just one drama in a migration of almost 1.8 million people across the Mediterranean from the Middle East and Africa since 2014 that has seen hundreds of thousands embark from Libya on small boats, according to United Nations figures.
Thousands have drowned and boats like the Open Arms, a retired 36-metre tugboat built in 1973, have taken up the task of offering rescue.
NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK
After being lifted aboard the Open Arms and during her medical examination, Josepha told doctors she was from Cameroon.
They said she did not give them her last name or any details of her story or explain who the other passengers on the raft were. It was also unclear how the raft was damaged.
Locating migrants adrift is like finding a needle in a haystack, but on the night of July 16 the crew say they got lucky as they scanned radio frequencies.
Just before 9 p.m. we heard a commercial ship, Triades, tell the Libyan coastguard that they had seen a raft adrift. The captain swung the Open Arms toward its reported location and spotted the remains of the raft at 7.30 a.m. the next day.
After the rescue, it was three and a half days before we arrived at the only harbor that would take her, in Spain's Palma de Mallorca. By the time we reached land, she was still unable to walk unassisted.
The drama did not end there.
The founder of Open Arms, Oscar Camps, filed a lawsuit in Palma accusing the captain of Triades and the captain of the Libyan coast guard of involuntary manslaughter and failing to help the migrants.
Under international maritime law, ships should attempt the rescue of anyone in danger at sea.
In Spain, an accuser files a lawsuit to the local court, in this case in Palma, and the presiding judge decides whether to take the case further. 
The court in Palma said the claim was still being processed and an investigating magistrate had consequently not yet been assigned. 
The Triades, a merchant ship flying under a Panamanian flag and owned by Greek shipping company Newport SA, was docked at the Turkish port of Dortyol on Monday.
Newport declined to comment. Reuters could not contact the captain of the Triades through Newport, which declined to give the captain's contact details, or through the port authorities at Dortyol. 
Reuters talked to Ibrahim Ozen, a general manager at Global Container Line, a company that provides information about the port's activities, for contact with the ship.
Ozen said on Thursday he would attempt to reach someone on the Triades. He had not replied by Monday and did not respond to further questions.
A spokeswoman for Open Arms said Josepha would answer no further questions because of the lawsuit.
Camps said radio traffic between the Triades and Libya's coast guard showed the ship's crew had seen the raft but failed to provide help. I heard the radio exchange between the Triades and the coast guard which corroborates Camps' account.
Camps also accused Italy and Malta of refusing to let Open Arms dock after the rescue, forcing it to make a much longer journey to Spain. Italy said this was not the case and accused the charity of lying about the circumstances of the rescue.
In a Twitter post, Italy's interior minister denied that the country had refused to let Open Arms dock with Josepha and the bodies on board.
""Despite the willingness of our Sicilian ports (to let the boat dock) the NGO ship is going to Spain,"" Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini wrote on Twitter.
Camps, citing Josepha's account, said the Libyan coastguard had abandoned the three migrants amid the shattered remains of the raft because they refused to board their patrol ship. It was unclear how the raft came to be partially destroyed.
Libya's coastguard denied in a statement it abandoned the raft at sea.

""It is not in our religion, our ethics or our conduct to abandon human lives at sea, where we only came to save them,"" it said in a statement that also disputed Camps' version of events.

Bernardino Rafael, chief of police, said Abdul Faizal, Abdul Remane, Abdul Raim, Nuno Remane, Ibn Omar and a sixth known only as Salimo, were leading attacks in Cabo Delgado - a poor province on the border with Tanzania where companies are developing one of the biggest gas finds in a decade.
The names are the first clear sign that authorities have detailed information about the people behind the attacks that began last October and have grown into the potential beginnings of an Islamist threat. Previously, authorities would only say that attacks had been carried out by ""unknowns.""  
The move also comes as security sources say Mozambican forces are carrying out a series of large offensives to try and fatally weaken the insurgency.
""We regard these as the ringleaders,"" Rafael said during a visit to Pemba, the capital of Cabo Delgado. The comments were aired on national radio, according to Lusa.
""We ask anyone that has any possible information that could lead to the capture of these names we've indicated to contact the Police of the Republic of Mozambique,"" he added.
The group behind the attacks goes by the name Ahlu Sunnah Wa-Jama, or ""followers of the prophetic tradition."" 
Its aim is to impose a radical form of Islam as an antidote to what it regards as corrupt, elitist rule that has broadened gaping inequality. Its activities have drawn comparisons with the start of Boko Haram in Nigeria.

""This is welcome. Out intense work continues and will be followed up in different ways,"" she said.
""Sweden's position is known and remains - Gui Minhai must be set free and able to reunite with his family.""
Sweden complained in March that Chinese authorities had denied a promised visit to Gui by a Swedish doctor, calling the move ""unacceptable."" China responded, saying the publisher himself had rejected the visit.

ANKARA (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan on Monday accused ""economic terrorists"" of plotting to harm Turkey by spreading false reports and said they would face the full force of the law, as authorities launched investigations of those suspected of involvement.
The lira currency, which has lost more than 40 percent against the U.S. dollar this year, pulled back from a record low of 7.24 earlier on Monday after the central bank pledged to provide liquidity, but it remained under selling pressure and its meltdown continued to rattle global markets.
""There are economic terrorists on social media,"" Erdogan told a gathering of Turkish ambassadors at the presidential palace in Ankara, adding that the judiciary and financial authorities were taking action in response. 
""They are truly a network of treason,"" he added. ""We will not give them the time of day... We will make those spreading speculations pay the necessary price"".
Erdogan, who gained sweeping new powers following his re-election in June, said rumors had been spread that authorities might impose capital controls in response to the slump in the currency, which tumbled as much as 18 percent on Friday alone.
The interior ministry said it had so far identified 346 social media accounts carrying posts about the exchange rate that it said created a negative perception of the economy. It said it would take legal measures against them but did not say what these would be.
Separately, the Istanbul and Ankara prosecutor's offices launched investigations into individuals suspected of being involved in actions that threaten Turkey's economic security, broadcaster CNN Turk and state news agency Anadolu reported.
Turkey's Capital Markets Board (SPK) and financial crime board have also said they would take legal steps against those who spread misinformation about financial institutions and firms, or reports that the government would seize foreign-currency deposits.
Earlier on Monday, Finance Minister Berat Albayrak, who is also Erdogan's son-in-law, said Turkey would start rolling out an economic action plan on Monday.
Albayrak stressed the importance of budget discipline, and ruled out any seizure or conversion of dollar-denominated bank deposits into lira.
Economists say the lira's fall is due to worries about Erdogan's influence over the economy, his repeated calls for lower interest rates, and worsening ties with the United States over the detention of a Christian pastor and other disputes.
Erdogan reiterated on Monday his view that the currency's crash had no economic basis, saying that U.S. sanctions imposed on Turkey over the terrorism trial of the pastor, Andrew Brunson, represented a ""stab in the back"" by a NATO ally. 

The lira stood at 6.89 against the U.S. dollar at 1511 GMT - after Erdogan's comments - up from a record low of 7.24 to the dollar reached in early Monday trade.

Mammadov, leader of a rights group called Republican Alternative (ReAl), was convicted and sentenced in 2013 for organizing and taking part in demonstrations in the northern town of Ismailli against a provincial leader.
Fellow activists and lawyers of the accused said at the time that the court's verdict was politically motivated while the European Court of Human Rights said in May 2014 that the courts in Azerbaijan had violated Mammadov's right to liberty.
The European court ordered the Baku government to pay him 22,000 euros ($30,000) in compensation and free him, though this never happened.
A court in Baku on Monday released him before the end of his sentence, putting him on probation for two years and banning him from leaving Azerbaijan, a Reuters correspondent reported from the court.
""I'm not happy with the decision of the court. This is not a complete, but a partial victory,"" Mammadov told journalists at his home soon after the release.
The mainly Muslim country, sandwiched between Russia and Iran, has been governed by President Ilham Aliyev since he succeeded his father in 2003.
It has been courted by the West because of its role as a counter-balance to Russia for supplies of oil and gas to Europe, while rights groups accuse Baku of muzzling dissent and jailing opponents, charges which the government denies.

ON BOARD THE AQUARIUS (Reuters) - Italy on Monday denied safe harbor to the 141 people rescued by the humanitarian ship Aquarius off the coast of Libya last week, setting up another stand-off with European Union allies over who would take them in.
The Aquarius, run by Franco-German charity SOS Mediterranee and Doctors without Borders (MSF), picked up the people in two separate operations and is now in international waters between Italy and Malta.
Malta said on Saturday it would not welcome the ship while Spain said its ports were not the safest destination for the vessel.
More than 650,000 migrants have come to Italy's shores since 2014, prompting Rome to accuse its EU peers of not sharing the burden of caring for those who arrive on the bloc's southern border.
The Aquarius spent nine days at sea in June after Italy's new populist government took office and shut its ports to all humanitarian boats, calling them a ""taxi service"" and accusing them of helping people smugglers — charges the charities deny.
""It can go where it wants, not in Italy!"" far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said of the Aquarius on Twitter on Monday, mentioning France, Germany, Britain or Malta as destinations. 
""Stop human traffickers and their accomplices,"" he wrote. 
Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli, who oversees ports and the coast guard, said the ship's flag country, which is Gibraltar, should take responsibility.
""At this point, the United Kingdom should assume its responsibility to safeguard the castaways,"" Toninelli said on Twitter. 
The British foreign office was not immediately available for comment.
The European Commission was in touch with several EU states and trying to help resolve the ""incident"" with the Aquarius, a spokesman in Brussels said. She added that while Britain could theoretically be considered as a destination port, it was not practically feasible to bring the ship there. 
Malta's rescue coordination center told the Aquarius on Saturday that it would not welcome the ship, according to the charity ship's online log. 
On Monday, Malta's armed forces said that it rescued 114 migrants from a rubber dinghy taking on water 53 nautical miles south of the Mediterranean island. The migrants will be brought to Malta in the afternoon, sources said. 
In June, the Aquarius ended up taking some 630 migrants to Spain, which welcomed it. But on Monday, Madrid did not repeat its offer, with a government spokeswoman saying: ""At the moment, Spain is not the safest port because it is not the nearest one"" for Aquarius to dock. 
Due to pressure from Italy and Malta, most charity ships are no longer patrolling off the coast of Libya. 
Though departures from Libya have fallen dramatically this year, people smugglers are still pushing some boats out to sea and an estimated 720 people died in June and July when charity ships were mainly absent, Amnesty International estimates.
""Aquarius is now standing by at 32 Nautical miles from the European coast,"" the ship's digital log said on Monday. 
""Aquarius already requested a place of safety to Malta and Italy,"" it said. ""Both refused to coordinate the disembarkation of the survivors to a place of safety.""
Protracted feuds between EU states over how to handle immigrants have thrown the issue back onto the European agenda. That is despite overall Mediterranean arrivals having dropped sharply since the 2015 peak when a million people arrived. 

EU border agency Frontex said on Monday it counted 73,500 ""irregular border crossings"" into the bloc so far this year via the sea and the Western Balkans route, more than 40 percent fewer than in the first seven months of 2017.

The two leaders, who last met in May, will each make statements at 1600 GMT before the start of the talks at the Meseberg palace outside the German capital, said Steffen Seibert, adding that Merkel and Putin would take no questions.
""You could expect the talks to focus on bilateral relations, and certainly the issue of the Syrian conflict as well as the situation in east Ukraine and energy,"" he said on Monday.
Germany wants Russia to finalize a ceasefire in Syria with the United States as well as to solve the conflict in eastern Ukraine, where the Kremlin backs separatists against Ukrainian government forces.
Relations between the two countries have also been strained by the Nord Stream 2 project that will carry gas direct from Russia under the Baltic Sea to Germany.
The United States says the project will increase Germany's dependence on Russia for energy. Ukraine fears the pipeline will allow Russia to cut it off from the gas transit business. Germany's eastern European neighbors, nervous of Russian encroachment, have also raised concerns about the project.
Seibert said the European Union was in talks with Russia to ensure that Ukraine continues to play a role in the lucrative energy transit business even after Nord Stream 2 was completed.
Asked if Russia had signaled a willingness in the talks to fulfill European demands that Ukraine remained a conduit for Russian gas to Europe, Seibert said: ""The talks have not concluded."" 

Merkel and German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Berlin last month, along with the head of Russian's military general staff, Valery Gerasimov.

1354,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 10:06AM ET</span>",Malaysia seeks financier's $35 million jet linked to 1MDB scandal,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia is seeking to repossess a $35 million private jet owned by financier Low Taek Jho as part of investigations into a multi-billion dollar scandal at state fund 1MDB, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has said.
The financier, also known as Jho Low, bought the Bombardier Global 5000 jet for $35.4 million in 2010 using funds allegedly taken from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has said. 
Authorities in Malaysia and the United States are investigating how billions of dollars went missing from 1MDB. The DOJ says over $4.5 billion was misappropriated from the fund, with some of the money used to buy the private jet, a superyacht, Picasso paintings, jewelry and real estate. 
Last week, the $250 million superyacht Equanimity, which the DOJ says was also bought by Jho Low, was handed over to Malaysia by Indonesia, which had seized the asset earlier this year. 
When asked if Malaysia would also seek to take possession of the Bombardier jet, Mahathir said: ""Yes, I think so. We have to bring it back,"" state news agency Bernama reported on Sunday.
The jet was grounded last year in Singapore, according to some media reports. 
Aviation services firm Jet Aviation said a Bombardier Global 5000 with the same registration number as the one identified by DOJ was at its facility at Seletar Airport in Singapore.
A spokeswoman for Jet Aviation said the firm was ""working closely with the local authorities"". She declined to say how the firm came to be in possession of the aircraft. 
Singapore's foreign ministry did not immediately comment.
Singapore, one of at least six countries investigating 1MDB, said in 2016 it had frozen about S$120 million ($87.24 million) of funds and properties in the city-state belonging to Low and his immediate family. 
Malaysian authorities have issued an arrest warrant for Low, whose whereabouts are unknown. Low, whose Malaysian passport has been revoked, has previously denied any wrongdoing.
A representative for Low has said the handing over of the Equanimity yacht to Malaysia was illegal and in violation of Indonesian and U.S. court orders.
A spokesman for Low, through his attorneys, on Monday said if Mahathir's intention to seize the private jet was ""anything like his illegal seizure of the Equanimity,"" Mahathir will ignore ongoing legal processes and conduct a trial by media.
Mahathir's office was not immediately available for comment.

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan security forces backed by U.S. advisers and air strikes fought on Monday to drive Taliban fighters out of the embattled city of Ghazni, where hundreds of people have been killed or wounded during four days of fighting.
The Taliban attack on Ghazni, a strategic center on the main highway linking the capital Kabul with southern Afghanistan, is a blow to President Ashraf Ghani weeks before parliamentary elections are due and dampens hopes of a start to peace talks.
The insurgents seized control of the districts of Khawaja Omari north of the city and Ajrestan in the west, with officials saying dozens of Afghan security forces were killed or missing.
However Interior Minister Wais Barmak said the situation had improved by Monday afternoon, with reinforcements pressing the city's last pocket of Taliban resistance.
""Afghan forces are in complete control of the city,"" he told a news conference in Kabul.
Diplomats in Kabul said the government had admitted being taken by surprise by the attack and after days with minimal public comment from the presidential palace, Ghani announced on Twitter that reinforcements would be sent urgently.
Afghan officials said U.S. special forces units were on the ground helping to coordinate air strikes and ground operations and the U.S. military said its aircraft had launched two dozen air strikes since Friday.
""U.S. advisers are assisting the Afghan forces and U.S. airpower has delivered decisive blows to the Taliban, killing more than 140 since August 10,"" said Lt Col Martin O'Donnell, the spokesman for U.S Forces-Afghanistan.
The Afghan government controls Ghazni, he said, adding there was no threat of collapse from ""isolated and disparate"" Taliban forces, with Highway 1, the main route from Kabul, open.
""That said, clearing operations are ongoing and sporadic clashes with the Taliban, particularly outside the city, continue,"" he said.
The fighting fueled an increasingly fevered political atmosphere ahead of October's parliamentary elections, as concern grows over potential security threats from the Taliban and other armed groups.
As the battle raged in Ghazni, a suicide bomber in Kabul detonated explosives near the office of the independent election commission, where dozens of protesters had gathered, killing at least one police officer and wounding another, said a security official who sought anonymity.
The protesters had turned out in support of a parliamentary candidate disqualified by electoral officials over suspected links with illegal armed groups, as barred lawmakers encourage protests to disrupt the panel's activities.
DESTRUCTION
News from Ghazni remains patchy and incomplete four days after the insurgents launched their assault on Friday, with communications hit after fighting destroyed most of the city's telecoms masts.
But people escaping the city have described widespread destruction and bloodshed and Afghanistan's largest television station, Tolo News, broadcast shaky phone footage showing fires apparently raging across the blacked-out center.
Details of casualties were confused. Barmak said 70 police were killed in the fighting, while a security official earlier said about 100 soldiers and police had been killed.
The official said the Taliban suffered heavy casualties including about 50 fighters killed by an air strike on Sunday.
The number of civilian casualties was unknown but people fleeing the city have described bodies lying in the streets and aid groups said hospitals were struggling to cope with the wounded.
""Medication at the main hospital is reportedly becoming scarce and people are unable to safely bring casualties for treatment,"" Dr. Rik Peeperkorn, the acting U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator for Afghanistan, said in a statement.
The attack on Ghazni, the Taliban's heaviest blow since they came close to overrunning the western city of Farah in May, has hit hopes of peace spawned by a surprise three-day truce during June's Eid al-Fitr holiday.
""Clearly the Taliban have paid no heed to the Afghan people's calls for them to reconcile and join the peace process,"" O'Donnell said. 
Officials said Taliban fighters in residential areas knocked down walls to ease movement and make the security forces' task of targeting them harder.

""The militants know our forces will not attack civilians, so they are using young men as human shields to walk around the city and set buildings on fire,"" said one official in Kabul.

In his first national address since being declared winner in a disputed presidential vote, Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe had showed the world it could hold a free and peaceful vote but blamed the main opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) for violence that followed. 
""It is now time to put the election period behind us and embrace the future,"" Mnangagwa said during Heroes Day commemorations in the capital Harare.
""We should never be deterred by temporary setbacks or regrettable events which we encounter in our cause to build an open, free and democratic, prosperous Zimbabwe.""
The July 30 election, the first since Robert Mugabe was forced to resign after a coup last November, was cast as a watershed vote that could pull a pariah state back into the international fold and spark an economic revival.
But the violence that erupted after Mnangagwa's ruling ZANU-PF party won the national elections and the heavy-handed army response was another reminder that Zimbabwean society remains deeply divided even after Mugabe's near four decades rule.
MDC leader Nelson Chamisa and Mnangagwa's main rival who has challenged the election result at the Constitutional Court said in a message to mark Heroes Day that Zimbabwe was a broken and divided nation that needed healing and reconciliation.
The vote, he said, had been held in a ""scandalous"" way. 
""We must resolutely do everything in our power under our constitution to say 'No' to fraud and repression either in our electoral politics or justice system,"" Chamisa said.
ZANU-PF legal secretary Paul Mangwana said lawyers would respond to Chamisa's case by Wednesday.
The Constitutional Court, whose decision is final, can uphold the result, declare a new winner, order a fresh election within 60 days or make any other ruling it deems fit. 
The court must rule within 14 days of an election challenge being lodged. The days do not include weekends and public holidays according to the court rules.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Iran's Supreme Leader on Monday rejected U.S. President Donald Trump's offer of unconditional talks to improve bilateral ties and he also accused the Iranian government of economic mismanagement in the face of reimposed U.S. sanctions.
Washington reimposed the sanctions last week after pulling out of a 2015 international deal aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear program in return for an easing of economic sanctions. Trump has also threatened to penalize companies that continue to operate in Iran.
""I ban holding any talks with America... America never remains loyal to its promises in talks,"" said Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say on policy in the Islamic Republic. 
""America's withdrawal from the nuclear deal is a clear proof that America cannot be trusted,"" state TV quoted Khamenei as telling a gathering attended by thousands of Iranians.
The sanctions target Iran's trade in gold and other precious metals, its purchases of U.S. dollars and its car industry. 
Washington had said Iran's only chance of avoiding the sanctions would be to accept Trump's offer to negotiate for a tougher nuclear deal. Iranian officials already rejected the offer but it is the first time Khamenei has publicly commented.
But Khamenei ruled out the possibility of war with the United States.
""They (the Americans) are exaggerating the possibility of a war with Iran. There will be no war... We have never started a war and they will not confront Iran militarily,"" he said. 
ECONOMIC WOES
Khamenei, whose remarks on Monday come amid a sharp fall in the rial currency that has prompted angry protests, criticized the government of President Hassan Rouhani, a pragmatist cleric who championed the 2015 deal aimed at ending Iran's political and economic isolation. 
""More than the sanctions, economic mismanagement (by the government) is putting pressure on ordinary Iranians... I do not call it betrayal but a huge mistake in management,"" state TV quoted Khamenei as saying.
""With better management and more efficient planning we can resist the sanctions and overcome them,"" Khamenei said, in an apparent effort to deflect public anger over the deteriorating economy towards Rouhani's government.
European countries, which still back the 2015 deal, fear Trump's moves will undermine Rouhani and strengthen the hand of his hardline rivals in the clerical establishment.
The rial has lost about half of its value since April in anticipation of the renewed U.S. sanctions, driven mainly by heavy demand for dollars among ordinary Iranians trying to protect their savings.
Iranian officials have blamed ""enemies"" for the fall of the currency and a rapid rise in the price of gold coins, and more than 60 people, including several officials, have been arrested on charges that carry the death penalty.
""The corrupt people (officials) should be punished firmly,"" Khamenei said on Monday. 
Thousands of Iranians have protested in recent weeks against sharp rises in the prices of some food items, a lack of jobs and state corruption. The protests over the cost of living have often turned into anti-government rallies.
Defying U.S. demands to curb its missile program, Iran unveiled a new generation of its ""Fateh Mobin"" short-range ballistic missile on Monday, state TV reported.
""Our will to enhance our defense power in all fields will increase if the pressure mounts on Iran,"" Defence Minister Brigadier General Amir Hatami said after unveiling the ""fully home-made precision-guided"" missile.

Trump has said Iran must also stop meddling in conflicts in Syria and Yemen, but Foreign Minister Javad Zarif struck a defiant tone on Monday, telling Qatar's al Jazeera TV: ""Iran will not change its policies in the region because of U.S. sanctions and threats.""

QUETTA, Pakistan (Reuters) - A mine explosion in Pakistan's southwestern city of Quetta killed at least seven coal miners, a mining official said on Monday, with authorities expecting the death toll could rise.
The bodies of the dead were recovered on Monday morning, with efforts being made to retrieve six more men trapped in the mine but feared dead. 
""The explosion was caused by accumulation of methane gas,"" Iftikhar Ahmed, the chief inspector of mines in Baluchistan, the province home to Quetta, told Reuters. ""The miners were working at the depth of 400 feet at the time.""
The figure is equivalent to 122 m.
Explosions are not uncommon in Pakistan's coal mines, most of which are in Baluchistan and the neighboring province of Sindh, where safety measures can be lax.
In May, more than 20 miners were killed in a mine blast in Quetta.
Pakistan has huge reserves of coal, estimated at more than 184 billion tonnes. It produces 4 million tonnes of coal annually, most of which is consumed by brick-making kilns.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Vowing that ""no one can obliterate Taiwan's existence,"" President Tsai Ing-wen left on Sunday for the United States and two of Taipei's remaining diplomatic allies, amid pressure from China to try to stamp out references to the island internationally.  
China, which claims self-ruled and democratic Taiwan as its own, has stepped up a campaign against the island as it tries to assert Chinese sovereignty. Beijing has ordered foreign companies to label Taiwan as part of China on their websites and is excluding Taiwan from as many international forums as it can.
Also, China has also been whittling down the number of countries that recognize Taiwan - now just 18 - with Burkina Faso and the Dominican Republic switching relations to Beijing this year.
Speaking before her flight to Los Angeles, where she was stopping en route to Belize and Paraguay, Tsai struck a defiant tone.
""In going abroad, the whole world can see Taiwan; they can see our country as well as our support for democracy and freedom,"" Tsai said. ""We only need to be firm so that no one can obliterate Taiwan's existence.""
Tsai arrived in Los Angeles on Sunday and was scheduled to address a banquet for Taiwanese-Americans there on Sunday evening, then pay a visit to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library outside of Los Angeles on Monday, according to Phi Lin Chuang, a Taiwanese government spokeswoman.
China, which believes Tsai wants to push for Taiwan's formal independence, has already complained to Washington about her U.S. stopovers, which include Houston on her way back.
The trip starts one day after Taiwan's state-run refiner CPC Corp announced a deal valued at $25 billion to purchase liquefied natural gas from the United States over the next 25 years.
The deal was aimed at boosting trade relations with the United States by reducing its trade surplus and was also a sign of goodwill ahead of Tsai's visit, a person familiar with the government's thinking told Reuters.
Tsai, who says she wants to maintain the status quo with China, will also be looking to reaffirm Washington-Taipei ties and to shore up support ahead of local elections in Taiwan in November amid the escalating pressure from China. 
During her U.S. stops, Tsai intends to meet Ed Royce, chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, according to two people with knowledge of the plans. 
She will also meet with business representatives to discuss how Taiwan could drum up investment and procurement with the United States, they said. 
Washington has no formal ties with Taiwan but is the island's strongest ally and sole foreign arms supplier.

Tsai's U.S. stopovers come as China and the United States are engaged in a trade war, adding to Beijing's irritation with Washington.

GENEVA (Reuters) - China rejected on Monday allegations raised by a U.N. panel that 1 million Uighurs may be held in internment camps in the restive Xinjiang region, but said that some people underwent re-education after being deceived by extremists.
Hu Lianhe, deputy director general of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, said that authorities in the far western Xinjiang region protected the full rights of all citizens equally.
China says that Xinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists who plot attacks and stir up tensions between the mostly Muslim Uighur minority who call the region home and the ethnic Han Chinese majority.
""The argument that 1 million are detained in re-education centers is completely untrue,"" Hu told the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination on the second day of its regular review of China's record.
""On freedom of religious belief, Xinjiang guarantees citizens freedom of religious belief and protects normal religious activities,"" he said.
""Those deceived by religious extremism ... shall be assisted by resettlement and re-education,"" he added.
Gay McDougall, a panel member, said on Friday it had received many credible reports that 1 million ethnic Uighurs in China are held in what resembles a ""massive internment camp that is shrouded in secrecy, a sort of no rights zone"".
""To say that they don't violate rights of minorities does not prove anything. We have to more than a denial of allegations,"" she told the Chinese delegation on Monday.
""I notice that you didn't quite deny that these re-education or indoctrination programs don't take place,"" she added, seeking clarification on how many people undergo re-education.
Hu said China has clamped down on ""extremist and terrorist crimes"" in Xinjiang in accordance with the law, saying that there had been assassinations, explosions and poisonings there.
But, he said, it did not target any particular ethnic minority or seek 'de-Islamisation"" of the region.

Earlier on Monday, in the country's first response to the U.N. criticism, a state-run newspaper said that massively stepped-up security in Xinjiang has helped prevent ""great tragedy"".

1365,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 06:52AM ET</span>",Fatal crashes reveal plight of Italy's African laborers,"By Crispian Balmer
FOGGIA, Italy (Reuters) - Smears of blood and oil mark the spot on the road where a van full of migrant farm laborers slammed into an oncoming truck and somersaulted across the tarmac on Aug. 6, killing 12 of the men packed inside.
Just 48 hours earlier, a near identical crash on a neighboring road killed four other African workers as they too returned home from a grueling day harvesting tomatoes in this sun-roasted corner of southern Italy.
The twin tragedies - so close together and with such a high death toll - have brought into focus the dire working and living conditions imposed on thousands of migrant farmhands whose cut-price labor allows Italy to be one of the biggest fruit and vegetable exporters in Europe.
Ludovico Vaccaro, the magistrate investigating the Aug. 6 deaths, says rampant exploitation of foreign laborers has gone largely unchecked for years. ""They should rebel, but they are so poor they have to accept the unacceptable,"" he told Reuters. 
The multiple deaths have come at a time of rising anti-immigration sentiment in Italy, with the newly installed government moving to halt the arrival of migrants to the country and promising mass deportations for those already here.
Many of those toiling in the fields of Italy's Puglia region have been here for years, no closer to integrating into local society than the day they arrived by boat from Libya.
""I arrived in Italy on Aug. 26, 2013. I haven't created any problem, I don't have a criminal record, I didn't come here for fun. I just want to work,"" said Sutay Darboe, 42, from Senegal.
""Do Italians have any idea how we are treated? Do they even care?"" he said, taking a precious day off work to travel round various hospital morgues looking for the body of a relative of his who died in the Aug. 6 crash.
Darboe, tall and thin, wearing pink-rimmed glasses, was a distant cousin of Alasanna Darboe, a 28-year-old Gambian. They had worked together in the fields to make money to send home.
""He was a good man. A pious man. He had a wife and two children. They don't know he is dead yet.""
GANGMASTERS
The other dead came from Nigeria, Mali, Guinea, Ghana and Morocco. There is no suspicion of foul play in the crash, but Vaccaro believes the men were victims of the so-called ""caporalato"" system which exploits farm workers across Italy.
Rather than employing pickers directly and putting them on regular contracts, farmers turn to caporali, or gangmasters, who gather the laborers from various camps and ghettos that dot the countryside and drive them to the fields in overcrowded vans.
These middlemen hand out the wages, keeping a handsome share for themselves, migrants say. Several workers said that although they had signed contracts that promised them more than 5 euros ($5.71) an hour, in the end they got between 3.0-3.5 euros.
""You can earn about 35 euros a day, but you have to pay 5 euros for the transport,"" said Njie, a 23-year-old Gambian who only gave his surname. ""It is donkey work. White men check the plants and start yelling if just one tomato is left unpicked.""
Puglia labor accords stipulate that employers must pay for transport and say workers should spend a maximum 39 hours a week in the fields for a minimum salary of around 50 euros a day. 
Migrants say they put in much longer hours than that. They also have to bring their own food and water and are allowed only brief breaks even as temperatures soar to 40C (104°F) on the bleak Puglia plains, which lie far from the tourist trail.
Italy introduced a law in 2016 aimed at eliminating the caporalato phenomenon, but it has had little apparent impact. 
The prosecutor Vaccaro blamed this failure on a lack of police, labor inspectors and magistrates to enforce the law, as well as limited cooperation from the victims themselves.
""In order not to lose the chance of work, however bad it may be, the migrants don't talk,"" he said.
Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, who is head of the far-right League, said mafia groups controlled much of the farm labor system in the region.
Farmers' associations claim that many laborers are employed legally, but, in a tacit acknowledgment that pay is kept to a minimum, they also accuse major retailers of imposing low prices for their tomatoes and squashing margins.
""Prices of (canned) tomatoes have remained virtually unchanged since 1985, while the cost of production has risen,"" said Gianni Cantele, head of the farmers' group Coldiretti in Puglia. ""When you buy a bottle of tomato pulp you pay more for the bottle than you do for the contents.""
RED GOLD
Coldiretti says 345,000 foreigners from 157 countries work in agriculture, helping to harvest every fruit and vegetable grown here, from oranges to apples, from grapes to olives. But tomato is the predominant crop and is known locally as ""red gold"".
The World Processing Tomato Council says Italy will overtake China this year to become the world's second largest producer of processed tomatoes after the United States. The export of tomatoes generated 1.6 billion euros in 2017.
The business is built on the backs of men like Idrissa Diassy, a 24-year-old from Senegal who accuses the industry of taking advantage of migrants, many of whom can't go back home because of war, political persecution or lack of any papers.
""They treat us like slaves. We cannot go anywhere else. We aren't allowed into other places in Europe. It is a trap.""
Diassy is lucky, to the extent that he lives in an official, albeit overcrowded and decrepit refuge for migrants, which has running water and electricity. 
It was set up last year after a nearby camp, known as the Great Ghetto, was bulldozed by the authorities following a fire that killed three migrants. 
But with accommodation at a premium, the ghetto has risen again from the rubble - a shanty town of tiny shacks made of corrugated iron and wooden planks. Home to up to 1,000 people, it has zero amenities.
Coming down to Foggia in the wake of the road deaths, Salvini vowed to close the ghettos.
""It is not possible that in a progressive society such as ours ghettos should still exist,"" he told reporters, without saying where the shanty-town dwellers should go instead.
African laborers themselves see little chance that their lot will improve in a country where integration has proved notoriously difficult, even for those whose asylum requests are accepted and receive work papers.
Mahamadou Sima, who is from Mali and lives in the ghetto, has the right to work in Italy, but his efforts to get a regular job have failed, forcing him to stay in the fields.
""If you go for a job in Italy, you don't stand a chance if you are black,"" said Sima, describing how he had traveled to the northern city of Bologna to apply for a position in a cleaning company. 
""I handed over my CV. I have all the papers you need, but the person in the firm threw my application in the bin. It broke my heart.""

At least 40 children were killed in Thursday's raid which hit the bus as it drove through a market of Dahyan, a town in Saada, the armed Houthi group which controls the province said.
Cars bearing the logo of the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement transported the bodies, wrapped in white shrouds, from the hospital to a large square for prayers before heading to the graveyard, where rows of graves were dug on Friday.
People carried pictures of those killed as armed Houthi fighters managed the crowd attending the funeral. 
""My son went to the market to run house errands and then the enemy air strike happened and he was hit by shrapnel and died,"" said Fares al-Razhi, mourning his 14-year-old son.
""For my son, I will take revenge on Salman and Mohammed Bin Zayed,"" he said, referring to leaders of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
The Gulf Arab states are leading the alliance of Sunni Muslim countries that intervened in Yemen's war in 2015 to try to restore the internationally recognized government that was expelled from the capital Sanaa by the Houthis in 2014. 
The coalition said on Friday it would investigate the strike after U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the attack and called for an independent probe. 
But on Saturday, the Saudi state news agency SPA said Saudi Arabia's mission to the world body had delivered a message to Guterres reiterating that the military action was ""legitimate"" and had targeted Houthi leaders responsible for ""recruiting and training young children"".
TALKS PLANNED
The coalition initially said after the attack that the strike had targeted missile launchers that were used by the Houthis to attack the southern Saudi province of Jizan.
The Houthis' health minister Taha Mutawakil said last week that the estimated number of casualties stood at 51 killed including 40 children, and at least 79 people wounded, of which 56 were children. The International Committee of the Red Cross reported the same toll on Friday, citing authorities in Saada.
The head of the Houthis' supreme revolutionary committee, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, attended the funeral and blamed the United States ""for this crime and all the crimes that have been committed against Yemen"", the Houthi-held al-Masirah TV said.
The United States and other Western powers provide arms and intelligence to the alliance, and human rights groups have criticized them over coalition air strikes that have killed hundreds of civilians at hospitals, schools and markets.
A U.S. military spokeswoman said U.S. forces were not involved in Thursday's air strike. The U.S. State Department urged the Saudi-led coalition to ""conduct a thorough and transparent investigation"".
The coalition says it does not intentionally target civilians and has set up a committee to probe alleged mass casualty air strikes, which has mostly cleared it of any blame.
The Houthis have also been criticized by rights groups.

The U.N. special envoy to Yemen has been shuffling between the warring parties ahead of holding consultations in Geneva on Sept. 6 in an effort to end the conflict that has killed more than 10,000 people and pushed the impoverished Arab country to the verge of starvation, according to the United Nations.

TAOS, N.M. (Reuters) - Five parents arrested on charges of abusing their 11 children at a New Mexico compound where a 12th child died under suspicious circumstances were due back in court on Monday for a hearing to decide whether the defendants should remain jailed without bond.
The five, all close relatives of a prominent New York City Muslim cleric who is the biological grandfather of most of the children involved, were taken into custody after a raid on the ramshackle settlement 10 days ago in the high desert north of Taos.
The principal suspect, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, 39, also has been charged with custodial interference in the alleged abduction of his sickly 3-year-old son, Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj, last December from the Atlanta home of the boy's mother.
A cross-country search for the missing boy and his father ultimately led investigators to the 10-acre compound on the outskirts of the community of Amalia near the Colorado border. Eleven children, ranging from one to 15 years of age and described by authorities as clothed in rags and starving, were placed in protective custody during the Aug. 3 raid.
The remains of a young boy, believed to be Abdul-Ghani, were found buried at the site three days later. Authorities have said they were awaiting autopsy results to positively identify the remains and determine a cause and manner of death.
Siraj Ibn Wahhaj and his wife, Jany Leveille, along with his brother-in-law and sister - Lucas Morton and Subhannah Wahhaj - and a second sister, Hujrah Wahhaj, were each charged with 11 counts of felony child abuse.
Prosecutors also have alleged in court documents that all five adults conducted weapons training with their children ""in furtherance of a conspiracy to commit school shootings."" 
It was on that basis that prosecutors filed petitions with state District Judge Sarah Backus seeking to keep the five detained without bail. No charges related to the weapons allegations were known to have been filed prior to Monday's hearing.
The allegation stemmed from a statement to investigators by a foster parent for one of the children involved, prosecutors said.
Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe has said authorities found a shooting range at one end of the compound, and that Wahhaj was heavily armed when taken into custody.

One neighbor told Reuters last week that target shooting that had gone on at the property on an almost daily basis until police drones were first spotted circling the area in late May or June, as authorities launched aerial surveillance of the compound.

Those sacked were accused of involvement in 17 cases of bogus purchases of supplies, drugs and equipment at inflated prices, the spokesman, Harry Roque, told reporters.
Civilians and military officials were among those sacked. The servicemen faced a court martial, he added. 
Duterte was ""personally aggravated and angered"", having recently ordered that 50 million pesos ($936,908) be made available to the main military hospital where the offences took place, Roque said.
Military chief Carlito Galvez said he was angered to learn that men in uniform had profited by inflating the prices of prosthetics bought for soldiers who had lost limbs in battle. 
In his campaign against corruption, Duterte has sacked dozens of officials, including many of his own appointees.

1372,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 05:24AM ET</span>","North, South Korea agree on third summit in North in September","By Hyonhee Shin and Joyce Lee
SEOUL (Reuters) - North and South Korea agreed on Monday to hold a summit in the North in September, another step towards boosting cooperation between the old rivals, even as doubts grow over efforts to end the North's nuclear weapons program.
Officials from both sides meeting in the truce village of Panmunjom, in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) that separates the two Koreas, reached an agreement on a September summit between the countries leaders in the North's capital of Pyongyang.
No date was announced for what will be the third meeting this year between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in.
They first met in April in Panmunjom, a remarkable thaw in ties after more than a year of rising tension and fears of war over the North's development of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.
There they agreed that Moon would visit the North's capital in the autumn, though the pair met again in May in an unannounced meeting at Panmunjom. 
No details on an agenda for next month's talks was announced, but the two Koreas have been discussing a range of issues, from a possible peace declaration to joint economic and infrastructure projects.
The progress between the two Koreas comes as North Korea and the United States are struggling to agree on how to bring about the North's denuclearisation, after Kim vowed to work toward that goal at a landmark summit in June in Singapore with U.S. President Donald Trump. 
U.S. officials have told Reuters that North Korea had yet to agree to a timeline for eliminating its nuclear arsenal or to disclose its size, which U.S. estimates have put at between 30 and 60 warheads.
After Monday's talks, Ri Son Gwon, the chairman of a North Korean committee aiming for the ""peaceful reunification"" of the peninsula, told reporters it was important to clear ""obstacles"" preventing inter-Korean relations from moving forwards.
""If the issues that were raised at the talks aren't resolved, unexpected problems could emerge and the issues that are already on the schedule may face difficulties,"" Ri said, without giving details.
PROBLEMS
One issue that has angered North Korea recently has been the case of a dozen North Korean restaurant workers who came to the South in 2016 via China.
The North says they were abducted by the South and should be returned, and has raised the possibility of the issue creating an obstacle to the reunion of some families divided by the 1950-53 Korean War, planned for next week.
South Korean Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon, who represented his country at the talks, declined to say if North Korea had raised the restaurant workers on Monday, merely saying it had not raised new issues.
""There were mentions that if there are problems to be resolved by both sides, on humanitarian issues or for the development of inter-Korean relations, we should do it,"" the minister told reporters.
Cho also said the two sides had exchanged views on the North's denuclearisation and on a peace mechanism to replace the armistice that ended fighting during the Korean War.
Moon and Kim agreed during their first summit to push for a declaration of an end to the Korean War together with the United States this year, but Washington has said it would only be possible after the North abandons its nuclear program.
Last month, the North's state media criticized the South accusing it of only caring only about the views of the United States and failing to take practical steps to advance inter-Korean relations.
South Korea hopes to restart efforts on a cross-peninsula railway but has been cautious about major projects due to international sanctions chiefly engineered by Washington over the North's nuclear and missile programs.
The North has urged the United States to end the sanctions, saying it had made goodwill gestures, including a moratorium on nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of a nuclear site, and the return of the remains of some U.S. soldiers killed in the Korean War.
Ri said the two sides had agreed on a date for the summit, but he declined to elaborate 

Kim Eui-kyeom, a spokesman of South Korea's presidential office, said it would be difficult for the summit to happen before the Sept. 9 anniversary of North Korea's founding, a major holiday there.

More than 350,000 people fled their homes after the 6.9-magnitude quake to shelter in government-provided tents or makeshift structures in open fields. Authorities say aid is slow in getting to some of the hardest-hit areas as they are remote. 
""The damage and losses are huge,"" Sutopo Nugroho, the spokesman of Indonesia's National Disaster Mitigation Agency, said in a statement.
""It will take trillions of rupiah...and a lot of time to heal the lives of the people and the economy of Nusa Tenggara Barat,"" he said, referring to the province home to Lombok.
Residential homes and public infrastructure suffered the bulk of the damage, he added.
On Monday, President Joko Widodo visited the island, which lies just east of Bali, the southeast Asian country's most famous tourist destination, for the second time since a slightly smaller quake on July 29.
He has called for search operations and relief efforts to be stepped up.
""I have ordered that the evacuation of victims who have not yet been found be made a priority,"" Widodo said in a statement at the weekend.

China has already sentenced dozens of followers of Quannengshen, or the Church of Almighty God, since the murder of a woman at a fastfood restaurant by suspected members of the group in 2014 sparked a national outcry.
In the latest case, an unspecified number of members of the group have been on trial in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang since July 31, state news agency Xinhua said late on Sunday.
""Heilongjiang police arrested the leader and some key members of the cult branch in northeast China in June 2017,"" the report said, citing local police.
It provided no other details of the case and it was not possible to reach a representative of the group in China for comment.
The group, which originated in central Henan province, believes that Jesus was resurrected as Yang Xiangbin, wife of the sect's founder, Zhao Weishan, Xinhua said. Zhao is also known as Xu Wenshan, Xinhua said, adding that the couple fled to the United States in 2000.
The group mainly recruits less-educated women who have family problems, and ""lures"" them in with normal Christian teachings, the report said.
""In the beginning new recruits were not forced to donate or attend the gatherings but after becoming a convert they were manipulated to leave their family and devote everything to the cult,"" it quoted an anonymous Heilongjiang police officer as saying.
Members are banned from using mobile phones, watching television or reading non-religious books and are made to ""watch videos made for brainwashing"", Xinhua added.
In 2012, China launched a crackdown on ""Almighty God"" after it called for a ""decisive battle"" to slay the ""Red Dragon"" Communist Party, and preached that the world would end that year.
China's constitution proclaims freedom of belief, but in reality the officially atheist ruling Communist Party keeps a tight rein over all religious activities and has cracked down on sects it says threaten social stability and promote violence.

A Newspoll for The Australian newspaper showed Turnbull's lead as preferred prime minister over opposition Labor leader Bill Shorten fell 4 percentage points in the past two weeks, a result that weakens his hand ahead of a critical meeting of the centre-right government on Tuesday.
Turnbull's personal popularity has so far safeguarded his leadership in a country where leadership changes have become common in recent years when polls have shown the government on course for an election defeat.
""Turnbull is again on the back foot. If he can't regain the momentum and get through his centrepiece policies, those leadership questions will again emerge,"" said Haydon Manning, a political science professor at Flinders University in South Australia state.
Turnbull's Liberal-National coalition government still trails Labor, the Newspoll opinion poll showed, although the margin was unchanged at 49-51.
Australia's government will convene on Tuesday after a six-week recess, the first time it will meet since a series of by-election defeats late last month. 
Those results fueled pressure on Turnbull to resolve more than a decade of battles over climate and energy policies and spur investment in new power supply, as well as to provide clarity over whether he intends to pursue corporate tax cuts despite polls showing voters oppose them.

Turnbull's coalition failed to win any of the five by-elections in July, defeats widely seen as an indication he faces an uphill task to be re-elected at a national poll due by May 2019.

1381,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2018 10:35PM ET</span>",Arrested and killed: inside the Bangladesh prime minister's war on drugs,"By Clare Baldwin and Ruma Paul
DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh police arrested Riazul Islam as he was walking home from his in-laws' house. At 3:15 a.m., he was shot dead in a sandy field beside a set of railroad tracks north of Dhaka.
Police say he was killed in a gunfight with other drug dealers, and they recovered 20 kg of marijuana from the site. His parents say the officers extorted money from them and then killed him.
""I knew my son was in police custody. All of a sudden my son was dead. I couldn't believe it. The police took money and they still killed him,"" said his mother, Rina Begum. 
Bangladesh is the newest frontline in state-backed drug crackdowns in Asia, and Islam is one of more than 200 people shot dead by police in Bangladesh since May, when Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina announced the campaign.
Critics say the crackdown reflects Hasina's increasingly authoritarian rule ahead of a general election, due by December. That was also shown in its response to recent student demonstrations over road traffic deaths, including the use of rubber bullets and the arrest of a prominent photographer.
Hasina emphasized that the police and intelligence agencies would now tackle the drug problem in the same tough way they had countered violent extremism in recent years. 
Such campaigns can be popular with voters as has been shown by President Rodrigo Duterte's bloody drug war in the Philippines.
Hasina's office did not respond to questions about whether the drugs campaign was a populist ploy.
Bangladesh's drug war - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Mx0jzz
MOUNTING DEATH TOLL
The bodies appeared rapidly after Hasina's pronouncement. And, just like the Philippines, the killings appeared to follow a script: suspects  died in ""gunfights"", typically at night, and weapons and drugs were found nearby.
In more than a third of the 211 killings recorded by Dhaka-based human rights group Odhikar since mid-May, the suspects were arrested before they were killed.
The police are overseen by Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan, who denied the police were executing suspects.
""Our law enforcement people don't kill, they don't execute anyone. It is impossible. If they do so they will be fired at that moment,"" he told Reuters. ""It is not a lawless country.""
After Islam was arrested, according to the police report, officers took the ""top terror"" of the neighborhood to the field beside the railroad tracks to draw in and arrest other drug dealers. The other dealers ""sensed"" the officers' presence and began firing randomly, and ""to save life and government property"", the officers fired back. 
""Roni [Islam] was shot and fell down. He died on the spot,"" according to the report, which said two officers were wounded.
Islam's autopsy report, read to Reuters by a hospital official, noted that a single bullet entered his head near his left ear and exited near his right. Each of the two officers were treated for small areas of tenderness and swelling on one of their hands, according to records at another hospital.
None of the six witnesses in the police report saw Islam die, they told Reuters. 
One of the six, handyman Mohammad Bappy, who lives at the edge of the field where Islam was shot, snapped photos of Islam's dead body. One of the pictures shows blood on the ground beneath Islam’s head. 
""There was no gun,"" he said. ""If there had been a gunfight we would have heard lots of firing from two sides. That didn't happen.""
Kamal Hossain, the officer in charge of the operation, said drug use leads to crime and arrests don't work.
""They come out on bail and they do the same thing, selling and using drugs,"" he said. ""Every drug dealer should be killed. Then drugs can be controlled.""
LITTLE DATA
The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, U.S. ambassador to Bangladesh and the European Union have all expressed concern about the killings of drug suspects in Bangladesh. 
After a government official in the southern city of Teknaf was gunned down by Rapid Action Battalion police in May, the state-funded National Human Rights Commission sent a letter to the ministry in charge of the police to remind it of human rights. 
But Hasina pressed on. 
""Drugs destroy a country, a nation and a family,"" she told parliament in June. ""We will continue the drive, no matter who says what.""
Most of the killings took place in May, when there were 129 as the campaign began, but then dropped to 38 in June before picking up to 44 in July.
Drugs have long been a concern for the Bangladesh government, which bans consumption of alcohol by Muslims, who make up the vast majority of the population.
But it's not clear how much drug use has grown or even how many people use drugs. Asked for figures, Bangladesh's narcotics deputy intelligence chief said there were none.
""We have no government statistics or non-government statistics about users,"" Nazrul Islam Sikder said, adding: ""But we guess 7 to 8 million.""
Drug seizures data from the Department of Narcotics Control suggests the drug trade has grown, but much of the increase happened three years ago, long before Hasina launched the crackdown. The data shows a dramatic increase in methamphetamine or ""yaba"" pill seizures beginning in 2015.
No one believes the official accounts of the killings, said Rashid Alam, a 50-year-old manager of a garment factory near the field where Islam was shot, but he is more concerned about the scourge of drugs use for communities.
""We understand he is a drug dealer and the police shot him,"" he said. ""That kind of death is okay. Good job, really.""
Critics of Hasina say the crackdown is meant to show voters she is responding to popular concerns and to strike fear in political opponents ahead of the election. According to media reports, some of those killed were activists of the opposition Bangladesh National Party. 
For Ashrafuzzaman Zaman, liaison officer of the Hong Kong-based Asian Human Rights Commission, the politics of the drug crackdown are clear.
""You kill 200 people and you make 150 million afraid: today or tomorrow you can also be one of them. That is the message the government is giving to the people,"" he said.
Hasina's office did not respond to the allegations from her critics.
But Home Minister Khan denied the campaign was a cover to target opposition politicians, and said no drug offender is treated differently from another.

""His identity is only as a criminal,"" he said. ""Even if he has a link with the ruling party, he will not be spared.""

A U.N. human rights panel said on Friday that it had received many credible reports that 1 million ethnic Uighurs in China are held in what resembles a ""massive internment camp that is shrouded in secrecy"".
China has said that Xinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists who plot attacks and stir up tensions between the mostly Muslim Uighur minority who call the region home and the ethnic Han Chinese majority.
Hundreds have died in unrest there in recent years.
In joint editorials in its Chinese and English versions, the widely-read Global Times tabloid said criticism of the rights record in Xinjiang was aimed at stirring trouble there and destroying hard-earned stability.
China's security presence there has prevented Xinjiang from becoming another Syria or Libya, it added.
""There is no doubt that the current peace and stability in Xinjiang is partly due to the high intensity of regulations. Police and security posts can be seen everywhere in Xinjiang,"" the paper wrote.
""But it's a phase that Xinjiang has to go through in rebuilding peace and prosperity and it will transition to normal governance.""
Maintaining peace and stability there is in the basic interest of people in Xinjiang and all of China, it added.
""The turnaround in Xinjiang's security situation has avoided a great tragedy and saved countless lives, thanks to powerful Chinese law and the strong ruling power of the Communist Party of China,"" the paper wrote. 
""What the West has been hyping has destroyed numerous countries and regions. When the same evil influence was spreading in Xinjiang, it was decisively curbed.""
Xinjiang has ""no room for destructive Western public opinions"", and all steps must be taken to ensure its stability, it said. 
""Peace and stability must come above all else. With this as the goal, all measures can be tried. We must hold onto our belief that keeping turmoil away from Xinjiang is the greatest human right.""

1383,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2018 07:58PM ET</span>",Japan's Akihito pushed imperial boundaries to reach out to Asia,"By Linda Sieg
TOKYO (Reuters) - When Japanese Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko stood, heads bowed, at a seaside cliff on Saipan 60 years after a bloody World War Two battle, their silent prayers conveyed a message many felt resonated louder than words. 
On that June 2005 visit - one of many war-related trips during Akihito's three-decade reign - the royal couple paid their respects at memorials not only for Japanese but also American and Korean war dead.
""I think the emperor felt heartfelt pain and mourning for those who died, and that we must not forget the tragedy of the war and should convey that to the generations who have not experienced it,"" Shingo Haketa, former grand steward of the Imperial Household Agency, which manages the monarch's affairs, told Reuters in an exclusive interview.
Haketa and a half-dozen other associates of the emperor recounted to Reuters how after the death of his father on Jan. 7, 1989, Akihito carved out an active role as symbol of peace, democracy and reconciliation.
Although he cannot directly influence government policy, Akihito has created a broader consciousness of Japan's wartime past, experts say. 
That is a sharp departure from the legacy of his father, Hirohito - once revered as a ""living god"" in whose name Japan fought World War Two. Hirohito's comments about the conflict were vague after Japan's defeat, and he remained a divisive figure because of his role. 
Akihito, 84, will abdicate next year. On Aug. 15, he will for the last time as reigning emperor take part in an annual memorial ceremony honoring war dead held on the anniversary of Japan's surrender.
His retirement comes amid tensions with China and the Koreas, and his legacy appears threatened by a Japanese drift to the right mirrored in Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's conservative agenda.
Japanese political leaders have expressed regret, remorse and apology for their country's wartime actions. But remarks by the emperor have a different weight, experts say.
""Emperors are like popes - their gestures carry a symbolic message,"" said Andrew Horvat, a visiting professor at Japan's Josai International University.
PUSHING THE ENVELOPE
Politicians have sometimes undercut official apologies, but Akihito's message has remained consistent.
""People see (Akihito and Michiko) as sincerely and respectfully trying to reach out to wartime victims in a deeply symbolic and very reconciliatory way,"" said Jennifer Lind, a Dartmouth College professor who has written about apologies.
Friends and scholars credit Akihito's post-war education with laying the foundations for how he forged his role. Influences included Quaker tutor Elizabeth Vining and former Keio University head Shinzo Koizumi, who saw many of his students die in the conflict.
""Currently, most Japanese people think that the emperor is gentle and kind,"" Mototsugu Akashi, a former classmate, told Reuters. ""But that is clearly a post-war phenomenon.""
The makeover of the monarchy began after Japan's surrender in 1945, when Akihito was 11.
In theory, the emperor can say what he likes as long as his remarks don't violate the post-war constitution, which defines the emperor as ""the symbol of the State and the unity of the People"", devoid of governmental power and unable to interfere in politics.
In practice, Akihito's public remarks are carefully vetted to ensure they don't violate those rules, with delicate discussions determining how forthright he can be.
Akihito strained against those limits, say those who know him.
""I know that for one or two speeches, he was angry with the Imperial Household Agency and foreign ministry about the words to be used,"" said Michael Barrett, who knew Akihito while head of the British Council in Japan during the 1990s.
""It was said that they (the imperial couple) were birds in a gilded cage, but he opened the door of that cage,"" he added.     
CONSERVATIVE BACKLASH
In one early example, Seoul in May 1990 wanted the new emperor to apologize for Japan's often brutal 1910-1945 colonization of the Korean peninsula. 
Ruling party lawmakers objected, and prime minister Toshiki Kaifu offered to apologize instead to South Korean president Roh Tae Woo. 
Akihito, however, had his own ideas.
""The current emperor wanted to make clear that it was Japan that caused the suffering of the Korean people,"" Makoto Watanabe, a former imperial grand chamberlain, an aide to the emperor, told Reuters in an interview.
Ultimately, Akihito had his way after private negotiations with government officials.
""I think of the sufferings your people underwent during this unfortunate period, which was brought about by my country, and cannot but feel the deepest regret,"" he said at a banquet for Roh. 
The early years of Akihito's reign saw a flourishing of debate over Japan's responsibility for World War Two and a series of government apologies.
The statements, and efforts to teach children about Japan’s wartime actions, sparked a conservative backlash against a view of history seen as undermining national pride and identity.
In 1992, Akihito became the first modern Japanese monarch to visit China. Domestic right-wing groups opposed the trip, while Chinese activists demanded an apology.
While in China, the emperor said he felt ""deep sorrow"" for the suffering Japan inflicted on the Chinese people. 
The next year, he began visits to wartime sites, beginning in Okinawa, where resentment lingered against mainland Japan over the islanders' wartime sacrifices. 
OVERSEAS BATTLEFIELD
Six decades after the war's end, he visited Saipan, a U.S. territory, on his first trip to a foreign battleground.
""He had felt strongly that he wanted to pray for all the souls who died in the war, not just domestically but overseas, not just Japanese but all the people of the world,"" Haketa said. 
""Usually, the emperor's overseas trips are in response to requests by the government, but this trip was based on his strong personal desire,"" he added. 
Despite Akihito's age and health problems - he has had heart surgery and been treated for prostate cancer - he has continued his travels.
In 2015 he and Michiko went to Palau's tiny Peleliu island, site of a fierce battle in 1944. In 2016 they visited the Philippines and this year returned to Okinawa.
On the 70th anniversary of Japan's defeat, Akihito expressed ""deep remorse"" over the war, a nuanced departure from his annual script.
Many liberals and moderate conservatives saw it as a subtle rebuke to Abe, who a day earlier had expressed ""utmost grief"" for the suffering Japan inflicted but said future generations should not have to keep apologizing.
Months later, Akihito told a news conference to mark his 82nd birthday: ""I believe having thorough knowledge about the last war and deepening our thoughts about the war is most important for the future of Japan."" 
Akihito's heir, Oxford-educated Crown Prince Naruhito, 58, holds similar views on teaching about the tragedy of the war.
“It is important to look back in a humble way on the past and pass on correctly the tragic experiences of war ... from the generation that experienced the war to those who have grown up without first-hand knowledge of it,” Naruhito told a news conference ahead of his 55th birthday.
But it is unclear how much impact Naruhito will have, partly because like most Japanese, he did not experience the war.

""If he speaks of remorse, many people will ask, 'Remorse for what?'"" said Keio University imperial law professor Hidehiko Kasahara.

A military tribunal in 2016 pardoned six of seven soldiers allegedly involved in killing the 22 suspected cartel henchmen in Tlatlaya, a small town a couple of hours southwest of Mexico City.
Authorities said at the time that those killed were members of a cartel and that the armed forces acted in self defense.
Later, international media organizations reported that there was evidence the killings were extrajudicial, and Mexico's National Human Rights Commission later echoed that conclusion.

Discontent in some parts of the military is one of the challenges related to the insurgency faced by President Muhammadu Buhari months ahead of a February election he plans to contest in which security looks set to be a campaign issue.
The soldiers - who witnesses said were shooting for around four hours from 06:30 p.m. (1730 GMT) - said they were protesting against their redeployment from their base in Maiduguri, state capital of Borno, to Marte, a restive district in the state.
""We are angry and that is why we are shooting. Why are they taking us again to another place after spending about four years?"" said a soldier, adding that they were previously told they would only fight insurgents for a maximum of three years. 
A military spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment.
Henrietta Yakubu, a spokeswoman for the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), said she was told the protest had ended. ""The situation has normalized,"" she said, adding that the protest had not forced the airport to shut down. 
Reuters was unable to independently verify whether the protest had ended. 
The unrest comes amid problems within the military's ranks as the fight against Boko Haram continues, despite the government having said since December 2015 that they had technically been defeated. 
In July a fourth commander in 14 months was named to lead the fight against the militants after a number of embarrassing defeats. Last week at least 15 soldiers and an official from Nigeria's disaster agency were killed by suspected militants.

1386,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2018 05:42PM ET</span>",Splits deepen over British ex-minister Johnson's burqa comments,"THAME, England (Reuters) - Former British foreign minister Boris Johnson returned from his summer holiday to face both criticism and support over his remarks about burqas, amid deepening divisions in Britain's ruling Conservative Party on Sunday.
Johnson, seen as the biggest threat to Prime Minister Theresa May's struggling leadership, has become a lightning rod for discontent within the party after a newspaper column in which he said Muslim women who wear burqas look like letter boxes or bank robbers.
The comments came in a Aug. 5 piece arguing against a ban on the Islamic full-face veil, but have been criticized as Islamophobic. Others saw the remarks as colourful rhetoric that strikes a chord with many Britons.
May has scolded Johnson, stirring anger amongst those of his supporters who see him as the focal point for resistance to her proposed ""business-friendly"" Brexit plan. The party has also launched an investigation into his remarks.
Under the headline ""Boris sparks cabinet war"" the Sunday Times said four unnamed senior ministers were dismayed at May's handling of the situation.
""They have managed to engineer a total disaster,"" one minister was quoted as saying. ""Trying to silence Boris is stupid, especially when the majority of people agree with him.""
Johnson spent Sunday at his residence in the small town of Thame, around 80 km (50 miles) northwest of London, emerging only to bring cups of tea to reporters. Asked whether he regretted his comments, he declined to comment.
Johnson resigned from the cabinet last month in protest at May's Brexit plan, setting himself up as a talisman for the many Conservatives who want a more radical departure from the European Union.
Meanwhile, May has struggled to hold her cabinet together on Brexit and faces a testing few months in which she hopes to secure a deal on leaving the EU, face the party's unhappy grassroots, and win a crucial vote in parliament. 
Johnson's burqa remarks were defended by, amongst others, Donald Trump's former political strategist Steve Bannon, who told the Sunday Times that his overall message had been lost because of a ""throwaway line"". 
Bannon has previously called on Johnson to challenge May's leadership.
But a Conservative member of the upper house of parliament and former government polling adviser, Andrew Cooper, accused Johnson of ""moral emptiness"" and populism over the remarks.
""The rottenness of Boris Johnson goes deeper even than his casual racism & his equally casual courting of fascism. He will advocate literally anything to play to the crowd of the moment,"" Cooper said on Twitter.
Johnson, who has made clear that he does not intend to apologize over his burqa comments, did not address the row in his latest column which was published late on Sunday evening.

Instead he focused on housing policy, saying stamp duty land tax, a tax which is applied to property purchases, was ""absurdly high"" and was stalling the property market. He also criticized developers for delivering poorly built homes and hoarding land.

U.S. aircraft conducted at least four air strikes but details of the fighting were unclear as most of the city's telecoms masts were destroyed in fighting over recent days.
A senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said around 80 members of the security forces, as well as an unknown number of civilians had been killed.
Mohammad Sharif Yaftali, Afghan army chief of staff, said the city was not under threat of collapse and heavy fighting was underway to push back the Taliban from the city limits.
""Strategic locations and centers in the city are under the control of Afghan forces and the Taliban are hiding inside people's homes and shops and resisting,"" Yaftali told reporters at a news conference in Kabul.
But lawmakers from Ghazni who managed to talk to some residents said the Taliban were in control of much of the city after launching an initial attack in the early hours of Friday.
""Only the governor's office, police headquarters and intelligence agency's compound are in the hands of the government and Taliban are pushing to take them,"" said Chaman Shah Ehtemadi, a lawmaker from Ghazni.
The attack, the heaviest blow struck by the Taliban since they came close to overrunning the western city of Farah in May, dampened hopes of peace talks which had grown since a surprise three-day truce during the Eid al-Fitr holiday in June.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the insurgents had taken the district center of Khwajaumari, north of the city, and several areas in other districts of Ghazni province. Many members of the security forces had surrendered, he said.
Local officials have warned for months that Ghazni, a city on the main highway linking Kabul with Afghanistan's south, was under threat, with the Taliban in control of most of the surrounding province.
Mohammad Rahim Hasanyar, a member of the provincial council, said heavy fighting was continuing in several areas of the city and Afghan forces were in defense mode.
""No one knows what the exact situation is because there is no communication service,"" he said.
""FIRE AND DEAD BODIES""
With the highway heavily mined to prevent reinforcements from arriving, residents were largely trapped inside but some who managed to escape across fields on the city's periphery said many government buildings were ablaze.
""There was burning and fire and dead bodies everywhere in the city,"" Abdul Wakil, a resident who escaped, told Reuters at a checkpoint into Kabul.
The Red Cross said on Twitter that it was watching the situation closely. It had supplied body bags to the provincial hospital and was ready to provide more assistance.
President Ashraf Ghani made no mention of the crisis during an extended speech on youth affairs on Sunday and with little coming out from the government, people were left to rely on alternative sources of information.
Short videos circulating on social media, purported to be from Ghazni, showed a number of heavily armed Taliban patrolling in the city with a large plume of smoke and flames coming out from the town.
""It is over and the city is taken,"" said a man standing outside his home, with several Taliban insurgents nearby.
The videos could not be independently verified by Reuters but they generated heavy commentary by social media users that underlined the shock caused by the attack.
U.S. military headquarters in Kabul said sporadic clashes were occurring and American aircraft had conducted five strikes on Saturday and four more on Sunday.
""The Afghan National Defence and Security Forces continue to hold their ground and maintain control of all government centers,"" Lt Col Martin O'Donnell, U.S. Forces Afghanistan spokesman, said in an emailed statement.

The Taliban have not taken a major provincial center since they overran the northern city of Kunduz in 2015 and the assault on Ghazni was a major blow to the Western-backed government just weeks before parliamentary elections scheduled for Oct. 20.

No one was injured in the incident, it said.
The NOS cited the Turkish consul, Tolga Orkun, as saying the man was a 34-year-old Dutchman. Dutch police did not disclose the man's nationality or possible motive but confirmed an arrest took place shortly after the incident occurred on Saturday evening.
Orkun said the man threw three homemade devices at the consulate and that security footage showed that two of them - a cluster of spray paint cans held together with tape and a Molotov cocktail - failed to ignite. The third, another Molotov cocktail, caused the fire in the garden, he said.

The protests in Bucharest and in several other major cities were peaceful, in contrast to the first night of demonstrations on Friday when riot police fired tear gas and used water canon on a huge rally in central Bucharest, with hundreds of people needing medical attention.
About 15,000 people rallied in front of the government headquarters in the capital on Sunday, whistling, blowing vuvuzelas and shouting ""Corruption kills! Resignation!"". They also chanted ""Thieves, thieves,"" waving Romanian, U.S., NATO and European Union flags.
Peaceful rallies have repeatedly been held since the Social Democrats took power in early 2017 and tried to decriminalize several graft offences.
Earlier this year, ruling party legislators pushed changes to the criminal code through parliament, drawing concern from the European Commission and U.S. State Department. The changes are being challenged in the Constitutional Court.

Social Democrat leader Liviu Dragnea was sentenced to three and a half years in prison by the Supreme Court in June for incitement to abuse of office, a ruling which is not final as it is pending an appeal.

A militant wearing a suicide vest blew himself up 250 meters from a Coptic Christian church in Qalyubiyah, a governorate north of Cairo, killing himself but no one else according to eyewitnesses and state media.
The attack was the latest directed at Egypt's large Christian minority, who make up around 10 percent of the country's 96 million people.
Islamist militants carried out two deadly bombings on Palm Sunday in April 2017 and a blast at Cairo's largest Coptic cathedral in December 2016 that killed 28 people, while a church shooting last December killed eleven. 
State news agency MENA said Saturday's bomb attack was thwarted by a strong security presence around the church that prevented the assailant from getting too close.
An interior ministry statement identified the attacker as 29-year-old Omar Mohamed Ahmed Mostafa from Cairo but did not link him to a particular militant group. 
No group has claimed responsibility.
The statement said the seven arrested were plotting a ""series of hostilities"" and that among them were two women, including one living in the upscale Cairo neighborhood of Zamalek who ""played a prominent role ... in promoting extremist ideas and providing financial support"".
Egypt has fought an insurgency led by Islamic State in the Sinai Peninsula that has killed hundreds of soldiers and policemen in recent years, but attacks in the country's mainland are less common.

Arison's investment arm Arison Group recently sold control of Shikun & Binui to U.S.-Israeli businessman Naty Saidoff.
Arison was summoned along with another executive of Arison Group, Efrat Peled, by the Israeli police's anti-corruption unit, Arison Group said in a statement.
""They cooperated fully and are certain there was no flaw in their conduct, and that this will also be the conclusion of the enforcement agencies,"" it said.
Arison Group completed the sale of its 47.5 percent stake in Shikun & Binui to Saidoff last week for 1.1 billion shekels ($296 million).
Shikun & Binui said in February that four current and former employees of a foreign subsidiary had been detained for questioning by Israeli police on suspicion of bribery in Africa.
Shikun said at the time that the subsidiary was conducting its own examination using an independent firm from abroad. It said it was not yet able to assess the accuracy of the allegations.
In a joint statement on Sunday, the Israeli police and the Israel Securities Authority said their investigation was focusing on suspicions that the company bribed foreign government officials to advance projects worth hundreds of millions of dollars in Kenya and other countries. 
The Israel Securities Authority and police said they were working with foreign enforcement agencies.
Arison along with her brother inherited billions of dollars from her late father Ted Arison, who founded Carnival (LON:CCL) Corp, the world’s biggest cruise ship operator. Through Arison Group she controls Israel's biggest bank, Hapoalim (TA:POLI).

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - An Ethiopian rebel group declared a unilateral ceasefire on Sunday, the latest dissident movement to aim for an end to hostilities in the wake of reforms.
The Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) launched its bid for secession of the Somali Region, also known as Ogaden, in eastern Ethiopia in 1984. In 2007, Ethiopian forces waged a large-scale offensive against them after the group attacked a Chinese-run oil facility, killing 74 people.
But the ONLF was among two other groups that were removed by parliament from a list of banned movements - part of a reform drive being led by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who has extended an olive branch to dissidents.
In a statement, the ONLF said it had ""taken into account the positive steps taken by the Ethiopian government to lay the groundwork for talks and peaceful negotiations"".
The group ""will cease all military and security operations to find a available and lasting solution to the Ogaden conflict"", it added.
The region the ONLF operates in contains four trillion cubic feet of gas and oil deposits, the government says. China's GCL-Poly Petroleum Investments has been developing two gas fields since 2013.
Abiy, who took office in April, is presiding over a bold push to shake the African nation of 100 million people from decades of security-obsessed rule.

He has also acknowledged and condemned widespread abuses by security forces, likening it to state terrorism, as well as forging peace with Eritrea, with which Addis Ababa has been locked in a lengthy military standoff that followed a 1998-2000 border war in which 80,000 people are thought to have died.

1393,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>",Humanitarian ship seeks European port for rescued migrants,"By Antonio Denti
ON BOARD THE AQUARIUS (Reuters) - Human rights groups called on European governments on Sunday to tell a charity ship where it can dock and let more than 140 migrants rescued in the Mediterranean disembark in safety.
The Aquarius, run by Franco-German charity SOS Mediterranee and Doctors without Borders (MSF), rescued 141 people in two separate operations off the Libyan coast last week.
The boat had just started heading north on Sunday toward Europe when Libyan coastguards called it back to pick up 10 migrants spotted aboard a small fiberglass boat.
As that rescue was underway, SOS Mediterranee and MSF asked for guidance on where to take those they had saved.
""What is of utmost importance is that the survivors are brought to a place of safety without delay, where their basic needs can be met and where they can be protected from abuse,"" said Nick Romaniuk, search and rescue coordinator for SOS Mediterranee.
The Aquarius has operated in the central Mediterranean since early 2016 and says it has helped more than 29,000 people in distress, many of them African migrants, who, until this summer, were brought swiftly to Italy without any incident.
However, when a populist government took office in Rome in June, it immediately shut its ports to all NGO boats, accusing them of encouraging illegal immigration and helping human smugglers -- charges the charities deny.
In June, the orange-hulled Aquarius picked up 629 migrants, including scores of children and seven pregnant women, but first Italy and then Malta refused to let it dock, provoking a row within the heart of the European Union over immigration policy.
Spain eventually agreed to take in the boat, but there was no indication of where the Aquarius might head on Sunday, with Malta immediately refusing it access and Italy saying at the weekend it would not be welcome at any of its ports.
SOS Mediterranee and MSF accused the Libyan coastguard on Sunday of endangering lives by not telling the Aquarius there were boats close to it that were in distress. They also said other ships in the area had apparently ignored the migrants.
""Ships might be unwilling to respond to those in distress due to the high risk of being stranded and denied a place of safety,"" said Aloys Vimard, MSF's project coordinator on board the Aquarius.
""Policies designed to prevent people from reaching Europe at all costs are resulting in more suffering and forcing those who are already vulnerable to take even riskier journeys to safety.""
More than 650,000 migrants have come to Italy's shores since 2014, but the numbers of new arrivals have plunged over the past year, with Rome encouraging the Libyan coastguard to carry out most of the rescues.

Speaking at his AK Party's provincial headquarters in the Black Sea city of Trabzon, President Tayyip Erdogan said a quarter of a million people had already returned to liberated areas in Syria.
""God willing soon we will have liberated more places and made more areas safe,"" he said.
Turkey is host to 2.7 million refugees from Syria.
Turkey is carrying out an offensive in northern Syria's Afrin region against the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, which Ankara considers a terrorist organization linked to Kurdish militants waging an insurgency on Turkish soil.
The Afrin campaign is Turkey's second cross-border operation during Syria's seven-year-old civil war. The first, dubbed ""Euphrates Shield"", targeted Islamic State and Kurdish fighters further east than Afrin, and was completed in early 2017.
Erdogan said diplomatic and military efforts in Syria's Idlib province, where Turkey has set up a dozen military observation posts, had been accelerated to avoid a ""catastrophe"" like those seen in other parts of Syria.
Syria's government and allied forces backed by Russia and Iran have swiftly recaptured other rebel strongholds in the southwest and vowed to push on and recover all of the country.
Idlib is the largest remaining Syrian rebel-held enclave and there are fears of further bloodshed in the event of a government-backed offensive. 
Erdogan also said Turkey was taking steps to save Iraq's Qandil area from being a ""nest of terror"" and that if needed northern Iraq's Sinjar region could be included in this process.

Turkey's army has ramped up operations in northern Iraq, with the aim of destroying Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) bases in the Qandil mountains, where high-ranking members of the militant group are thought to be located.

1395,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>",U.S. House candidates vulnerable to hacks: researchers,"By Joseph Menn
LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Three of every 10 candidates running for the U.S. House of Representatives have significant security problems with their websites, according to a new study by independent researchers that underscores the threat hackers pose to the November elections.
The research was due to be unveiled on Sunday at the annual Def Con security conference in Las Vegas, where some attendees have spent three days hacking into voting machines to highlight vulnerabilities in technology running polling operations.
A team of four independent researchers led by former National Institutes for Standards and Technology security expert Joshua Franklin concluded that the websites of nearly one-third of U.S. House candidates, Democrats and Republicans alike, are vulnerable to attacks. NIST is a U.S. Commerce Department laboratory that provides advice on technical issues, including cyber security.
Using automated scans and test programs, the team identified multiple vulnerabilities, including problems with digital certificates used to verify secure connections with users, Franklin told Reuters ahead of the presentation.
The warnings about the midterm elections, which are less than three months away, come after Democrats have spent more than a year working to bolster cyber defenses of the party's national, state and campaign operations. 
Democratic National Committee officials told Reuters they have completely rebuilt the party's computer network, including email systems and databases, to avert a repeat of 2016, when Russian intelligence agents hacked into Democratic accounts and then used stolen data to undermine support for Hillary Clinton's presidential bid. 
""No one wants to be the next 'patient zero,'"" said DNC Chief Technology Officer Raffi Krikorian, a former executive with Twitter and Uber. 
The report follows a string of warnings by Trump administration security officials that Russia is actively interfering in the November elections. FBI Director Christopher Wray recently warned that Russian government agents were working around the clock to sow discord ahead of the election.
Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill, who is facing a tough re-election battle in Missouri, last month said that hackers had tried and failed to access her office's computer network. The Def Con study did not address that incident.
The researchers did not identify any cases where it appeared that politically motivated hackers had exploited those vulnerabilities. 
""We're trying to figure out a way to contact all the candidates"" so they can fix the problems, said Franklin, who joined the nonprofit Center for Internet Security last month. 
Department of Homeland Security officials said at Def Con that they are offering aid to states and counties for securing election equipment. 
Still, some states said they are not getting enough help, and new funding efforts failed in Congress. Individual campaigns are not eligible for federal assistance, so they rely on party officials, an increased number of tech-savvy volunteers and nonprofit groups such as Defending Digital Democracy, a bipartisan project at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. 
Franklin also said he found numerous potentially malicious web pages that closely resemble the names of candidates. Hackers use that practice, known as “typo-squatting,” to develop copycat sites for use in phishing campaigns to steal credentials or to criticize candidates. 
The candidates at most risk of hacks are ones with small campaigns that have with little expertise in computer technology or security, Franklin said.
STEPS BY THE DNC
The Democratic National Committee agreed to discuss some steps it has taken to bolster security in the hope it can serve as a model for other election offices. 
Since Krikorian joined the DNC a year ago, the party has moved email and data storage to Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) cloud and replaced most Windows computers with easier-to-defend Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) hardware and Google Chromebooks, he said.
The party also requires staff to fill out monthly surveys pledging that they are following key security practices, including use of two-factor authentication for personal accounts, long and unique passwords, and encryption on computers. They are also asked if they are running operating systems and application software with up-to-date security patches. 
The party uses software from San Francisco-based Okta that grants access to DNC systems only after testing devices to confirm the identity of users and verify they are not running malicious software.
The biggest change has been psychological, as staffers and volunteers are trained to assume that the network has been breached, avoid putting the most sensitive information in emails and use end-to-end encrypted messaging like Signal. 
The party is also reaching out to campaigns and stressing basic precautions.
DNC Chief Security Officer Bob Lord, a former security executive with Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) and Twitter, sent an email a week ago to state party leaders, urging them not to use phones from Chinese manufacturers Huawei [HWT.UL] and ZTE Corp (HK:0763). 

U.S. intelligence officials have warned that Chinese authorities could seek to use those devices to spy on Americans.

Special Islamic revolutionary courts were being set up to try suspects quickly after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called on Saturday for ""swift and just"" legal action to confront an ""economic war"" by foreign enemies, state television quoted a judiciary spokesman as saying.
The rial currency has lost about half of its value since April over worries about the sanctions, with heavy demand for dollars among ordinary Iranians trying to protect their savings.
The cost of living has also soared, sparking sporadic demonstrations against profiteering and corruption, with many protesters chanting anti-government slogans. 
""Sixty seven suspects have been arrested, some of whom were released on bail, and more than 100 people including government employees and officials, as well as private employees and others have been given travel bans,"" judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei said in remarks carried by state television.
The central bank and the judiciary have blamed ""enemies"" for the fall of the currency and a rapid rise in the price of gold coins.
Those arrested included a former central bank deputy, and some faced charges carrying the death penalty, the judiciary said.
The judiciary has suggested that arch-foes the United States and Israel, as well as regional rival Saudi Arabia and government opponents living in exile, are fomenting the unrest and waging an economic war to destabilize Iran.
In May the United States pulled out of a 2015 deal between world powers and Tehran under which international sanctions on Iran were lifted in return for curbs on its nuclear program.
Washington this week reimposed sanctions on Iran’s purchase of U.S. dollars, its trade in gold and precious metals and its dealings with metals, coal and industrial-related software, and it is planning to impose heavier sanctions in November aimed at Iran’s oil sector.

The sentence is the latest among several trials and re-trials against Mohamed Badie and other senior leaders of the party that ruled Egypt before the military ousted Islamist President Mohamed Mursi following mass protests.
The sources told Reuters that Giza Criminal Court sentenced several top leaders including Badie, group spokesman Essam al-Erian, and senior member Mohamed El-Beltagy to life terms.
State news agency MENA said another defendant was jailed for 15 years and three others for 10 years.
Badie and the other defendants were convicted of incitement to violence on July 15, 2013, including the killing of five demonstrators and wounding of 100 during protests in an area in Giza known as al-Bahr al-Azim.
The court had previously sentenced 15 people to life imprisonment in the al-Bahr al-Azim case in September 2014 but an appeals hearing had subsequently struck down the ruling and ordered a retrial.
Since President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi came to power in 2014, authorities have justified a crackdown on dissent and freedoms as being directed at terrorists and saboteurs trying to undermine the state. 
Last month, a court referred the files of Badie and other Brotherhood leaders in a separate case to Egypt's most senior Muslim religious authority, the Mufti, for his opinion on whether they should be sentenced to death.
This case related to a 2013 sit-in that ended in the deaths of hundreds of Brotherhood supporters and dozens of police when security forces broke it up violently.
Egyptian law requires any capital sentence to be referred to Grand Mufti Shawqi Allam for an opinion before executions can take place. His opinion has yet to be announced.

Death sentences have been handed down to hundreds of his political opponents on charges such as belonging to an illegal organization or planning to carry out an attack. Mursi, who was ousted in 2013 after a year in office, is serving a life-sentence in jail.

""If the leaders feel the need to meet and get back to the questions that we think should unite Russia and the United States, but which provoke rejection among some circles in the United States, I think such meeting will take place,"" Lavrov said.
After their last meeting in Helsinki in July, Trump saw a wave of criticism at home for failing to confront Putin publicly over Moscow's interference in the 2016 U.S. election, and for seeming to contradict his own intelligence agencies on the threat from Russia. 
As a result, Trump postponed in late July a second meeting with Putin until next year.
A few days later, however, Putin said he wanted Trump to be his guest in Moscow, and the White House welcomed the idea despite lingering criticism over the Helsinki summit.
Russia is seeking such meetings as it is under punitive sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union and wants them lifted.

Lavrov said on Sunday Russia was ready to extend contacts with the United States on the level of foreign ministers if the U.S. side was ready to act on a basis of equality, RIA reported.

Police registered 704 such cases from January to June, down more than a third from the 1,127 reported in the first six months of 2017, according to the figures.
There were 77 attacks on asylum shelters and 627 attacks on refugees, with 120 people being injured in the first half of this year, the data showed.
The criminal offences committed included dangerous bodily harm, arson, property damage and incitement.
The influx of more than 1 million refugees, mainly fleeing from war zones in the Middle East, in 2015 and 2016 has led to a an increase in attacks on asylum shelters in Germany. But the number of new arrivals has gone down since last year.

The man, who had been taking photographs, was pronounced dead on arrival at the Naivasha District Hospital, while another tourist survived the attack on Saturday evening, according to the Kenya Wildlife Service. ""We are tracking the hippo,"" it said on Twitter.
The agency named the dead man as Chang Ming Chuang, 66, and the survivor as Wu Peng Te, 62.
The Chinese embassy did not immediately respond to a call for comment. 
On Sunday, Kenyan newspaper The Star quoted the head of a boat owners' association in Navaisha as saying that higher than normal water levels were causing hippos to wander from the lake on to nearby farms and hotel properties searching for pasture. Naivasha is a city on the lake 90 km northwest of the capital, Nairobi.
After a severe drought last year, Kenya had several months of heavy rains earlier this year that caused serious flooding, including around Lake Naivasha.
Tourism is one of the country's main sources of foreign exchange and nearly 1.5 million tourists visited Kenya last year, according to the tourism ministry.

1405,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2018 08:12AM ET</span>","Russia, Iran, and three others agree Caspian status, but not borders","AKTAU, Kazakhstan (Reuters) - Iran and four ex-Soviet nations, including Russia, agreed in principle on Sunday how to divide up the potentially huge oil and gas resources of the Caspian Sea, paving way for more energy exploration and pipeline projects.
However, the delimitation of the seabed - which has caused most disputes - will require additional agreements between littoral nations, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said.
For almost three decades, the five littoral states - Russia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan - have argued over how to divide the world's biggest enclosed body of water.
And while some countries have pressed ahead with large offshore projects such as the Kashagan oil field off Kazakhstan's coast, disagreement over the sea's legal status has prevented some other ideas from being implemented.
One of those is a pipeline across the Caspian which could ship natural gas from Turkmenistan to Azerbaijan and then further to Europe, allowing it to compete with Russia in the Western markets.
Some littoral states have also disputed the ownership of several oil and gas fields, which delayed their development.
POST-SOVIET ISSUE
The dispute began with the fall of the Soviet Union which had had a clearly defined Caspian border with Iran. In negotiations with post-Soviet nations, Tehran has insisted on either splitting the sea into five equal parts or jointly developing all of its resources.
None of its neighbors have agreed to those proposals and three of them - Russia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan - effectively split the northern Caspian between each other using median lines.
Azerbaijan, however, has yet to agree on how to divide several oil and gas fields with Iran and Turkmenistan, including the Kapaz/Serdar field with reserves of some 620 million barrels of oil.
The three countries have tried to develop the disputed fields while at times using warships to scare off contractors hired by other sides. As a result, none of the disputed projects has made much progress.
Speaking after the signing on Sunday, all five leaders praised it as historic event, but provided little detail about provisions on splitting the seabed.
However, making it clear that the document is no final solution, Rouhani said border delimitation would require further work and separate agreements, although the convention would serve as a basis for that.
TRANS-CASPIAN PIPELINE
Moscow has no outstanding territorial disputes but has objected, citing environmental concerns, to the construction of a natural gas pipeline between Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan which would allow Turkmen gas to bypass Russia on its way to Europe.
It remained unclear whether the convention adopted on Sunday would definitely clear a way for the pipeline. Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev said the document allowed pipelines to be laid as long as certain environmental standards were met.
Ashley Sherman, principal Caspian analyst at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, said that although the signing itself was ""an unprecedented milestone"" for the region, the immediate implications for the energy sector would be limited.
""We consider a Trans-Caspian Gas Pipeline (TCGP) unlikely, even in the longer term"", he said in an email. ""Clarity on the legal status will shine more light on the commercial and strategic obstacles to a TCGP, from infrastructure constraints to supply competition, not least from Azerbaijan itself.""
In the upstream sector, the increasing intent for joint projects in the south Caspian is very promising, Sherman said.
""Stranded fields and frozen exploration projects may well come back on the agenda,"" he said.
However, with offshore Caspian oil and gas production already almost at 2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, the impact from new fields - if and when disputes about their ownership are settled - might be limited.
""The scale of the projects in disputed waters is not comparable to the existing super-giant fields, from Azeri Chirag Guneshli and Shah Deniz in Azerbaijan to Kashagan in Kazakhstan,"" Sherman said.

The deaths raised to at least 325 the number of suspected militants killed in the Sinai campaign which began in February, according to a Reuters count based on military statements. At least 35 military personnel have also been killed.
The state news agency said security forces came under fire when they raided a walled compound in al-Arish, the capital of North Sinai province, without giving a time frame for the incident.
It said the raiding forces responded in kind and 12 suspected militants were killed in the shootout. The authorities were trying to verify their identities.
Five rifles, four of them automatic guns, were recovered from the scene as well as some ammunition and two ready-to-use bombs, MENA said.
There were no reports of casualties among security forces.
Sisi was re-elected in March in a landslide victory against one opponent seen as a token candidate. His critics say his presidency has brought a harsh crackdown on dissent, but supporters argue the measures are needed to stabilize Egypt, which was rocked by years of unrest after protests toppled veteran leader Hosni Mubarak in 2011.

1408,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2018 07:37AM ET</span>",President Keita favorite to win Mali poll overshadowed by militant threat,"By Tiemoko Diallo
BAMAKO (Reuters) - Malians voted in a run-off presidential election on Sunday, with incumbent Ibrahim Boubacar Keita expected to beat the opposition challenger despite a surge in ethnic and militant violence during his tenure.
The first round on July 29 was marred by armed attacks and other security incidents at about a fifth of polling places, as well as opposition charges of fraud.
But as voting got underway, no serious incidents were reported. Soldiers ran body checks on voters in the capital Bamako as they waited in line under rainy skies to cast their ballots.
Dramane Camara, 31, was the first to vote at one polling station in a school in the capital Bamako.
""I voted without problem, I came to fulfill my duty as a citizen,"" Camara said. ""I expect the new president to solve the problem of the North, which is peace. Because the return of peace means the return of NGOs, investors, so creating jobs.""
The chaotic first round was a reminder that militants, some linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State, have regrouped since French troops intervened in 2013 to push them back. They are now expanding their influence across Mali's desert north and into the fertile center.
Their presence in the vast West African nation and their ability to spread violence to its neighbors has kept Mali high on the list of Western powers' security concerns. Former colonial ruler France and the United States have deployed thousands of troops across the region.
The 73-year-old Keita called for a peaceful day and urged people not respond to any provocation as he voted in Bamako on Sunday morning. ""I pledge that all the difficulties we faced are now behind us,"" he told cheering supporters.
The government has stepped up security for the run-off, deploying an extra 6,000 troops on top of the 30,000 already on duty. Mopti region in central Mali, where most of the attacks in the first round took place, is a particular concern.
Keita, who is seeking a second five-year term, took 41 percent of the vote in last month's first round against nearly 18 percent for Soumalia Cisse, 68, a former finance minister and the main opposition leader.
Cisse, who lost against Keita before in a peaceful 2013 run-off, subsequently accused Keita's government of voting fraud but the constitutional court upheld the result.
Cisse blames Keita for the worsening violence and accuses his government of rampant corruption. Civil society website Malilink recorded 932 militant attacks in the first half of 2018, almost double that for all of 2017.
Jihadists are also stoking inter-communal conflict, mostly between herders and pastoralists. Killings along ethnic lines have claimed hundreds of civilian lives this year, including at least 11 last week in Mopti region.
OPPOSITION PROTEST
Keita's better-than-expected first-round showing and Cisse's failure to win endorsements from the third and fourth-place finishers augur well for the incumbent.
At his final rally in the capital Bamako on Friday, Keita -- known as IBK -- struck a confident tone.
""Some people were skeptical that these elections could take place. Some called on me to withdraw,"" he said above the din of his supporters' vuvuzelas. ""Let them understand that we had the capacity to organize credible elections and we have done so.""
On Saturday evening, about 100 opposition supporters demonstrated in Bamako's Liberty Square (NYSE:SQ) to complain about the result of the first round. Chanting ""No to electoral fraud"" and calling for transparency in the second round, they said there had been many instances of cheating in the first vote.
Armed troops watched over the protest but did not intervene.
Despite the militant threat, Malian polls have generally gone peacefully without the post-election violence common to many countries in the region.

Fatoumata Cissé, a 38-year-old teacher, said: ""I voted, no problem. I voted IBK. He has a positive balance especially for us teachers, our living conditions have improved. I hope that it will continue to improve the conditions of workers.""

AMMAN (Reuters) - Security forces pulled the bodies of three suspected militants from the wreckage of a building in a central Jordanian city on Sunday following a shoot-out in which at least four security personnel were also killed, the government said. 
In a huge security operation, Jordanian forces laid siege to the building in a residential part of Salt on Saturday night in a search for those responsible for a bomb attack on Friday on a police van.
The police vehicle had been maintaining security near a music festival in the majority Christian town of Fuhais, near the capital Amman and 15 kms (about 10 miles) from Salt.
Four security personnel were killed during the operation after the suspected militants sought sanctuary in the multi-story building in Salt, a hillside city, the government said.
The side of the building partially collapsed, possibly because of a blast from a suicide bomber inside, a security source said. 
Security forces had seized automatic weapons in a ""continuing operation,"" government spokeswoman Jumana Ghunaimat told Reuters. 
No group has claimed responsibility for Friday's attack in Fuhais on the van in which one policeman was killed and six others were injured. 
Militants from Islamic State and other radical jihadist groups have long targeted the U.S.-allied kingdom and dozens of militants are currently serving long prison terms.
King Abdullah, a Middle East ally of Western powers against Islamist militancy who has also safeguarded Jordan’s peace treaty with Israel, has been among the most vocal leaders in the region in warning of threats posed by radical groups.
Several incidents over the past few years have jolted the Arab kingdom, which has been comparatively unscathed by the uprisings, civil wars and Islamist militancy that have swept the Middle East since 2011.
It was not clear how many militants fled into the building which is in a busy residential quarter of the city. But five had now been rounded up in addition to three earlier, security sources said.
Part of the building was blown up by the militants, according to Ghunaimat and a security source said it was believed a suicide bomber had blown himself up causing its partial collapse. 
Ghunaimat had earlier said search and rescue operations were being conducted to ensure no civilians were being held hostage in what was left of the building.
""The building in which the terrorist cell was found is about to fall and will be demolished to prevent a sudden collapse,"" Ghunaimat added.
The shoot-out also injured at least twenty people, including women and children living in the area. They had been taken overnight to a main hospital in the capital, a medical source said.
Prime Minister Omar Razzaz set up a ""crisis cell"" bringing top security and government officials to coordinate the large scale security operation deploying hundreds of forces.
The security forces were investigating if the militants were part of a wider sleeper cell network of Islamist radicals that had planned a series of attacks, an official source said. 
Jordan said this year that it had foiled an Islamic State plot that included plans for a series of attacks last November on security installations, shopping malls and moderate religious figures. It arrested the suspects.
Security forces have been extra vigilant with warnings that sympathizers of Islamic State could launch revenge attacks after the militants were driven out of most of the territory they once controlled in Syria and Iraq.

Intelligence officials and some experts believe widening social disparities and a perception of widespread official corruption is fuelling a rise in radicalization among disaffected youths in a country with high unemployment and growing poverty.

1410,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2018 05:31AM ET</span>",U.S. ambassador urges Britain to ditch support for Iran nuclear deal,"LONDON (Reuters) - The United States urged Britain on Sunday to ditch its support for a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and instead join forces with Washington to counter the global threat it says Tehran poses. 
Despite opposition from European allies, U.S. President Trump in May pulled the United States out of a deal between world powers and Tehran under which international sanctions were lifted in return for curbs on Iran's nuclear program.
Since then, Britain, France and Germany have sought to keep the deal alive, while Trump has prepared new sanctions, saying a broader and more balanced deal is needed. Iran has denounced the sanctions as ""U.S. unilateralism"".
U.S. Ambassador to Britain Woody Johnson criticized Tehran for funding ""proxy wars and malign activities"" instead of investing in its economy. He said Iran needed to make tangible and sustained changes to behave like a normal country. 
""Until then, America is turning up the pressure and we want the UK by our side,"" Johnson wrote in the Sunday Telegraph newspaper.
""It is time to move on from the flawed 2015 deal. We are asking global Britain to use its considerable diplomatic power and influence and join us as we lead a concerted global effort toward a genuinely comprehensive agreement.""
Asked about Johnson's article, the British foreign office pointed to comments from Middle East minister Alistair Burt, who last week ruled out Britain going along with the United States. 
Burt said the deal was an important part of regional security and that, with the European Union, the government was trying to protect British companies from the U.S. sanctions when dealing with Iran. Britain remained open to talks with the United States on how to address concerns about Iran. 
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said last week that Trump's repudiation of the nuclear deal was illegal and Iran would not yield to Washington's renewed campaign to strangle Iran's vital oil exports.

But protests have broken out in Iran as its currency has collapsed in value and inflation has soared. The protests have often begun with slogans against the high cost of living and alleged financial corruption, but quickly turned into anti-government rallies.

The craft will endure extreme heat while zooming through the solar corona to study the Sun's outer atmosphere that gives rise to the solar winds. 
The Parker Solar Probe, a spacecraft the size of a small car, launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida about 3:30 a.m. Sunday, on a seven-year mission. It is set to fly into the Sun's corona within 3.8 million miles (6.1 million km) of the solar surface, seven times closer than any other spacecraft.
The corona gives rise to the solar wind, a continuous flow of charged particles that permeates the solar system and can cause havoc with communications technology on Earth. NASA hopes the findings will enable scientists to forecast changes in Earth's space environment.
The project, with a $1.5 billion price tag, is the first major mission under NASA's Living With a Star program.

The probe, named after American solar astrophysicist Eugene Newman Parker, will have to survive difficult heat and radiation conditions. It has been outfitted with a heat shield designed to keep its instruments at a tolerable 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29 degrees Celsius) even as the spacecraft faces temperatures reaching nearly 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit (1,370 degrees Celsius) at its closest pass.

Modi told the Times of India in an interview published on Sunday that his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led government is committed to improving the lives of all citizens regardless of faith.
Concerns have grown that his administration has been unable to rein in right-wing fringe groups that are trying to undermine India's secular constitution by targeting the nation's large Muslim minority.
""We will definitely get more seats than we got the last time and I am confident that we will break all records of the seats won by NDA (National Democratic Alliance) in the past and achieve greater glory.
""The people are with us and we have nothing to fear,"" Modi told the newspaper in an email interview.
Opinion polls show he remains the front runner to win another five-year term, but the party has suffered reverses in some local elections in the past few months that have energized the opposition. 
The BJP failed to win power in southern Karnataka in May, the first big state to elect a new assembly this year in a contest widely seen as a test of its popularity after four years in office. It also lost a few races in the big heartland state of Uttar Pradesh in the north.
But Modi said voters wanted a strong and decisive central government to deliver on India's promise as a big economy and one of the potential drivers of global growth. 
""My platform will be development, fast development and development for all...We have worked very hard in the last four years and we will go to the people with our track record of development,"" Modi said.
The opposition, led by the Congress party, is trying to pull together a grand alliance of regional parties and even communist groups to mount a joint campaign against Modi, who is seen as a divisive figure pushing a partisan, Hindu-first agenda.
Attacks on Muslims who are engaged in the cattle trade by Hindu vigilante groups who are opposed to the slaughter of cows have fueled fears that the government is either unable or unwilling to restrain them.
Modi's party denies any bias against Muslims and he told the Times of India that his government believes in equality in the rule of law for all citizens.
The BJP won 282 seats in the 2014 general election, giving it a simple majority in the lower house of Parliament. The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won 336 seats out of 543.
The opposition last month moved a no-confidence vote against the government but Modi easily survived thanks to his parliamentary majority.

1413,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2018 03:36AM ET</span>",Israel seeks early re-tender of mining rights to shore up Dead Sea,"By Ari Rabinovitch
EIN BOKEK, Israel (Reuters) - The Dead Sea is shrinking at the rate of about a meter a year, leaving behind deserted beaches and sinkholes in a slow-motion environmental disaster. 
The main culprit is the drying up of the Jordan river, its main tributary, as communities upstream draw on it for farming and drinking. But mineral extraction makes the crisis worse - of the 700-800 million cubic meters of water lost each year, 250-350 million cubic meters is due to mining, Israel estimates.
Up to now, the Israeli government has rarely intervened in the operations of the biggest extractor: the Dead Sea Works, formerly state-owned and now operated under a 70-year concession by Israel Chemicals (ICL).
That is about to change. 
Israel wants to re-tender the Dead Sea mining concession as much as eight years ahead of schedule, in 2022. It is motivated not only by environmental concerns but also by worries ICL will hold off on new investments in the concession's final years.
The government believes ICL will agree to its proposal, first because the firm will have the right of first refusal but also because it too has a powerful reason to scrap the current concession: an article that gives the government the rights to interfere in investments starting in 2020.
The plant is one of ICL's core assets, producing potash that goes into fertilizers, bromine for flame retardants and other products sold for billions of dollars worldwide.
The company, controlled by billionaire Idan Ofer's Israel Corp, has not made its position clear. It declined to give an immediate comment on its stance when contacted by Reuters.
""This is a one-time opportunity, as the concession comes to an end and we enter a new period, to set standards for the factory's operations and the environmental impact on the whole area,"" said Galit Cohen, deputy director-general for policy and planning at the Environmental Protection Ministry.
Cohen was on the high-ranking inter-ministerial committee that produced a preliminary report in May with guidelines that aim to balance profits with environmental interests in the Dead Sea for the first time. 
At the moment, ICL is largely free to do whatever it wants to maximize production, Cohen said, speaking to Reuters underneath a date tree on a northern beach at the lake.
""They have no incentive to reduce the amount of water they pump or think about from where they get the earth to build their dikes,"" she said. 
The Dead Sea has been popular for millennia for health seekers and tourists who come to float in its high-density waters and smear its mud on their skin. Without intervention, it will keep losing water, essential to the mineral extraction process, though experts believe it may eventually reach equilibrium at a much smaller size. 
ICL said in a July 5 letter to the committee that its report raised ""complicated legal, economic, operational and engineering issues, and ICL has significant reservations about part of what was said in it"".
""The company is studying the report and will relate to it as customary within the framework of the public hearing,"" ICL said in a statement to Reuters.
In its 2017 annual report, the company said its ability to refinance debt in the next decade ""... depends, among other things, on extension of the concession beyond 2030."" 
SETTING LIMITS
The factory's new license, whose term has not been set, will include pumping limits coupled with financial incentives to use less water, the committee's report said. The amount of territory open to quarrying and drilling for wells will be reduced. 
Final recommendations due around September are not expected to differ materially from the interim report's, said a senior government official, who asked not to be identified given the sensitivity of the issue.
""We think everyone has an interest in making the tender earlier,"" the official said. ""The value of the asset gets lower as we get closer to the end of the concession period and it's unclear what will happen after 2030.""
When the company was privatized in the 1990s, the government kept a ""golden share"" that gave it some oversight, in addition to the obligation under the terms of the concession that the company seek its approval for any new investment.
Michael Vatine, an analyst with Halman-Aldubi Investment House, said ICL was likely to want to avoid a decade of close government scrutiny.
""I think the company understands it needs to clear the fog regarding the long-term ... and not leave its investors feeling uncertain,"" he said.
With revenue of $5.4 billion in 2017, ICL manufactures a range of products from industrial chemicals to food additives. It is the world's sixth-largest producer of potash and supplies about a third of the world's bromine, used in fire retardants.
The company does not share publicly how much of its revenues come from the Dead Sea, where it also mines magnesium and salts.
Costs at the factory are lower than at conventional mines, which are often hundreds of meters deep. Solar evaporation is less energy intensive and the climate allows mountains of potash to be stored outside and sold when prices are high. 
According to their annual reports, ICL produced 3.7 million tonnes of potash at the Dead Sea in 2017 vs 2.1 million tonnes extracted by Arab Potash, which has exclusive rights on the Jordanian side that expire in 2058.
As ICL describes it, there is a virtually unlimited supply.
Bidders in a new tender would likely include the usual suspects from the small number of leading potash producers, including Russia's Uralkali, Germany's K+S AG and Canada's Nutrien, the report said.
Committee chair Yoel Naveh said it was possible competitors would be scared off by ICL's numerous advantages: not just right of first refusal but also its deep knowledge of the project.
""The state needs to set a price and below that not give it to a private concessionaire,"" he told parliament in June.

If the minimum failed to be met, the state should take over, he said. If someone else won, ICL would be compensated, he said, without naming a figure.

AZAZ, Syria (Reuters) - A ""National Army"" being set up by Syrian rebels with Turkey's help could become a long-term obstacle to President Bashar al-Assad's recovery of the northwest - if they can end factional rivalries that have long blighted the opposition.
The effort is at the heart of plans by the Turkish-backed opposition to secure and govern a strip of territory that forms part of the last big rebel stronghold in Syria.
The presence of Turkish forces on the ground has helped to shield it from government attack. 
Assad, backed by Russia and Iran, has vowed to recover ""every inch"" of Syria, and though he has now won back most of the country, the Turkish presence will complicate any government offensive in the northwest.
Turkey's role has gone beyond supporting allied Syrian forces to rebuilding schools and hospitals. At least five branches of the Turkish post office have opened in the area.
Colonel Haitham Afisi, head of the National Army, says setting up the force has been no easy task over the last year. 
""We are at the beginning. We face many difficulties but we are working to overcome them,"" Afisi told Reuters in an interview in the town of Azaz near the Turkish border. 
Recently, he had to issue an order instructing fighters to stop ""randomly opening fire"", wear uniforms and cooperate with a newly established military police that represents ""the force of law and justice and not a rival to any other faction"".
Factions have also been banned from operating their own jails and courts and from carrying out extra-judicial arrests.
The project has also faced attack: a number of recruits were wounded on Aug. 5 when their graduation ceremony in the city of al-Bab was shelled. Afisi said it was the work of an ""enemy of the revolution, be they internal or external"". The perpetrator had been identified, but he declined to say it who was.
IDLIB EXPANSION?
The National Army compromises some 35,000 fighters from some of the biggest factions in the war that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and forced some 11 million people from their homes over the last seven years.
Many previous efforts to unite the rebels have failed, obstructed by local rivalries and at times by the competing agendas of foreign states that once backed many of the rebels in the Syrian war.
The National Army could be different because of Turkey's presence on the ground.
The Turkish military pushed into the northwest in two campaigns. The first, ""Euphrates Shield"", which got underway in 2016, drove Islamic State from territory between Azaz and Jarablus. The second, ""Olive Branch"", captured the adjoining Afrin region from the Kurdish YPG militia earlier this year. 
The area is important to Turkey because of what it views as the national security threat posed by the YPG, which it sees as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a three-decade insurgency in Turkey. 
Assad says Turkey is illegally occupying Syrian land.
""All the support for the National Army is from Turkey, there are no other states partnering in this matter,"" Afisi said.
The Turkish foreign ministry did not respond to questions from Reuters.
Turkish support includes fighters' wages, logistical support ""and weapons if necessary"". He listed three enemies: Assad, the PKK and Islamic State.
Turkey has also set up 12 military posts in Idlib province and adjoining areas which are located southwest of Afrin, under an agreement with Russia and Iran. The stated aim is to observe a ""de-escalation"" agreement in the Idlib area.
Assad has indicated Idlib could be his next target. 
Afisi said the National Army could be quickly merged with Turkish-backed rebels in Idlib if necessary. 
The situation in Idlib is complicated by the presence of well-armed jihadists that have fought with the other groups. 

""We are ready and extend our hand to all groups that represent the goals of the revolution,"" he said.

TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Thousands of protesters rallied in Tel Aviv on Saturday against Israel's new law declaring it the nation-state of the Jewish people, legislation that has angered the country's Arab minority and drawn criticism abroad.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has defended the law, which says only Jews have the right of self-determination in the country and downgrades Arabic from an official language, saying it is necessary in order to fend off Palestinian challenges to Jewish self-determination.
The protesters, mostly Israeli Arabs, waved Palestinian flags and held up signs that read 'equality' in Arabic and Hebrew.
""The law legitimizes racism,"" said Laila al-Sana, 19, from a Bedouin village in Israel's southern Negev desert. ""It's very important to show we are here, to resist,"" she said.
Israel's Arab population comprises mainly descendants of the Palestinians who remained on their land after the 1948 war at the time of the creation of the modern state of Israel. Hundreds of thousands were forced to leave their homes or fled.
Many of Israel's Arab citizens also identify as Palestinian. They make up about a fifth of the state's 9 million people. Israeli law grants them full equal rights, but many say they face discrimination and are treated as second-class citizens.
""When I heard about the law I felt I should defend my hometown, our land, the land of my ancestors,"" said 68-year-old Sheikha Dabbah at the rally.
Largely declarative, the law was enacted just after the 70th anniversary of the birth of the state of Israel. 
It stipulates that ""Israel is the historic homeland of the Jewish people and they have an exclusive right to national self-determination in it"". It also downgrades Arabic from an official language alongside Hebrew to a ""special status."" 
""I feel ashamed that after 70 years I have to accentuate my nationalism instead of being generous toward all those who live here,"" said Gila Zamir, 58, a Jewish Israeli from the Arab-Jewish city Haifa.
Netanyahu posted on his Twitter page a video from the demonstration of a few protesters waving the Palestinian flag and chanting: ""With spirit, with blood we shall redeem you, Palestine"" and wrote: ""There is no better evidence of the nation-law's necessity."" Separate TV footage showed a few Israeli flags being waved.
Critics have said the new law is undemocratic because it differentiates between Jewish and non-Jewish citizens. Its defenders say civil equality is guaranteed in existing legislation. 
Arab leaders in Israel have said the law verges on apartheid. Rights groups and Jewish groups in the Diaspora have spoken against the legislation, as have the EU, Egypt and Israel's own president. 
Last Saturday a protest against the law by Israel's Druze community, which numbers about 120,000 citizens, drew a far larger crowd. [L5N1UV0GG]
The Druze are ethnic Arab members of a religious minority that is an offshoot of Islam incorporating elements of other faiths. 
Their outrage over the law has had more resonance in Israel, despite their small numbers, because of their reputation as loyal supporters of the state. Unlike the wider Arab population, many Druze serve in Israel's conscript military and security forces, and some have risen high in the ranks. 
Druze leaders have voiced a deep sense of betrayal over the law, striking a chord among many Israelis. However, efforts by Netanyahu to appease the Druze community have so far failed.

Muhammad Sohail Shaheen, spokesman for the Taliban's political office, said on Saturday Taliban representatives met Uzbek Foreign Minister Abdul Aziz Kamilov and Special Representative for Afghanistan Ismatulla Irgashev during the Aug. 6-10 visit.
He said they ""discussed current and future national projects such as security for railroad and power lines.""
""Views were also exchanged with officials of Uzbekistan about the withdrawal of foreign forces and how to achieve peace in Afghanistan,"" he said.
The statement, issued as Taliban fighters were battling government forces for control of the central city of Ghazni, adds to a mixed series of signals since an unexpected three-day truce during the Eid al-Fitr holiday in June.
Taliban representatives have met U.S. officials to talk about the framework for possible peace talks and the Western-backed government is considering offering a second ceasefire during the Eid al-Adha holiday later this month.
But at the same time, fierce fighting has continued in different parts of Afghanistan, inflicting heavy casualties on soldiers and police and threatening the security of parliamentary elections scheduled in October.
The attack on Ghazni, which controls a vital highway between the capital Kabul and southern Afghanistan, has given the insurgents their highest profile success since they came close to taking the western city of Farah in May.
The rail and power links from Uzbekistan are vital both for cross-border trade and for maintaining Afghanistan's shaky power supplies, which are already subject to frequent blackouts.
The Taliban, fighting to topple the Western-backed government and drive out international forces, have generally refrained from sabotaging vital infrastructure and have sought to reassure neighboring countries about their aims.
A senior Taliban official said the movement had established a political office in the Uzbek capital Tashkent aimed at developing better ties and showing that they did not intend to support local insurgent groups.

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (Reuters) - Hundreds of students and left-wing activists took to the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday, as a rally to mark the anniversary of last year's white nationalist gathering turned largely into an anti-police protest.
With chants like, ""Cops and Klan go hand in hand,"" the protesters' criticisms of both police and the University of Virginia underscored the resentment that still exists a year after torch-bearing neo-Nazis marched through campus, shouting anti-Semitic messages and beating counterprotesters.
Several students said they were angry that the police response was far larger this year compared with last year, when people carrying tiki torches the white nationalist rally went mostly unchecked.
At one point on Saturday, dozens of officers in riot gear formed a line near where the rally was taking place, prompting many protesters to rush over yelling, ""Why are you in riot gear? We don't see no riot here.""
The standoff ended without any clashes as organizers urged the crowd to move away and begin marching off campus. Police, who appeared to be avoiding a confrontation, rode bicycles ahead of the march to stop traffic.
The newly installed president of the University of Virginia, James Ryan, apologized for the school's inaction last year while speaking at an event to memorialize the anniversary.
Saturday's march capped a day of hope, grief, anger and remembrance in Charlottesville, one year after the ""Unite the Right"" rally brought racially charged street violence to the scenic college town.
The organizer of last year's rally, local blogger Jason Kessler, has planned a sequel for Sunday in Washington after being denied a permit in Charlottesville.
With hundreds of police maintaining a tight security perimeter around a 15-block downtown area, Charlottesville's normally bustling business district was relatively quiet on Saturday. The buzz of a police helicopter overhead was a constant throughout the day.
The massive police response was not welcomed by everyone, including some residents and business owners who complained that the restrictions were an overreaction.
The result, however, was a day largely devoid of conflict. Authorities arrested three men for minor offenses, including a 64-year-old disabled man who appeared to deliberately challenge the prohibition on certain items in the secured area.
The man, John Miska, who was wearing a handgun in a shoulder holster, visited a drugstore and purchased razor blades, which qualified as contraband under the city's emergency declaration. The gun, however, was not banned, based on state law.
When he refused an officer's request to take the razors to his car, he was arrested for disorderly conduct.
""This is the loss of our constitutional rights here in Charlottesville,"" he shouted, as officers led him away in plastic hand ties.
A group of anti-fascist protesters, sometimes known as ""Antifa,"" marched in the afternoon, carrying signs with messages like ""Good Night White Pride."" They stopped to pay their respects at the corner where a local woman, Heather Heyer, was killed when an Ohio man drove his car into a crowd of counterprotesters following last year's rally.
While some businesses closed for the weekend, many merchants remained open in a show of solidarity.
""It's my town, and I'm not afraid,"" said Karen Walker, whose floral shop Hedge was open on Saturday even though she did not expect much business. Outside her front door, a bucket of freshly cut flowers was available for passersby to take for free.
Many local residents also made a point of coming downtown to mark the anniversary. Kathe Falzer, 67, changed a flight to California so she could spend Saturday in town.

""I felt the need to be here and support the businesses,"" Falzer said as she ate lunch at a diner on Main Street.

(Reuters) - The airline worker who stole an empty airplane from a Seattle airport on a flight that ended in his death once ran a bakery with his wife and enjoyed the benefits that came with his job to travel the world, social media posts showed.
Richard Russell, who liked to be called Beebo, was a 29-year-old man living in Sumner, Washington, who was born in Key West, Florida, and moved to Wasilla, Alaska, when he was 7 years old, according to a Web page he set up for a college communications class.
He has not been officially named by authorities, but his family and multiple news media outlets have reported his identity.
Russell worked for Horizon Airlines, a sister carrier of Alaska Airlines [ALKAIR.UL], as a ground service agent who helped baggage handlers and was part of Horizon's tow team, which moved planes around on the tarmac. It was a job that gave him the perk of ""being able to fly to Alaska at my leisure,"" he wrote on the page.
In a video posted on YouTube last December, Russell shows luggage coming off and being loaded onto aircraft, and describes what the life of a ground service agent can entail.
""That means I lift a lot of bags, like a lot of bags, so many bags,"" he says, adding, ""it allows me to do some pretty cool things, too."" 
There are then shots of trips he took, including flying over Alaskan fjords, visiting lavender fields in France, touring in Yucatan, Mexico, and attending a hurling match in Dublin, Ireland.
""It evens out in the end,"" he says to end the video.
There was no mention in the social media posts of studying to become a pilot but in some posts he spoke of his Christian religious faith and the possibility of joining the military.
On a SoundCloud site, Russell interviews fellow ground service agents, asking them questions that include: ""What was one of your best travel experiences using your flight benefits?""
Authorities say he commandeered an empty Bombardier Q400, 107-foot (32.61 m) long turboprop aircraft on Friday night from a maintenance area at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. He flew for about an hour, often erratically with attempts at aerial stunts, before crashing on Ketron Island in Puget Sound, about 25 miles (40 km) to the southwest. 
He appeared to have acted alone and was suicidal, according to the local sheriff's department.
His family members said in a statement they were stunned and heartbroken. 
""It may seem difficult for those watching at home to believe, but Beebo was a warm, compassionate man,"" the statement said.
Russell's social media posts often showed him on adventures with his wife, who he said he met in Oregon in 2010.
""We were married one year later, and one month after that we opened a bakery which we successfully ran for 3 years,"" he wrote on his Web page. ""We consider ourselves bakery connoisseurs and have to try a new one every place we go.""
The couple later moved to Washington state, where he got a job with Horizon. His wife could not immediately be reached for comment.
The Seattle Times quoted Rick Christenson, an operational supervisor with the airline who retired in May, as saying Russell was a well-liked, quiet person. 
In his final moments captured by partial recordings of his conversations with air traffic controllers that were published online by Broadcastify.com, Russell spoke calmly and said he was sorry to disappoint people who cared about him and described himself as a ""broken guy"".

""Got a few screws loose, I guess,"" he is heard saying in the recording. ""Never really knew it until now.""

The attack took place on Friday evening in a rural area in Saravena municipality, in Arauca province near the border with Venezuela.
Ecopetrol, which owns the pipeline via its subsidiary Cenit, did not attribute the attack to a specific armed group. However, according to military sources, the pipeline has been attacked nearly 60 times this year by the National Liberation Army (ELN), the country's remaining active guerrilla group.
""The incident caused a spillage of crude into vegetation and soil, without affecting water sources, and reached part of a tertiary road that provides alternative access from Saravena to Tame municipality,"" Ecopetrol said in a statement.
Despite the stoppage of the pipeline, which can transport up to 210,000 barrels per day, production and exports from the Cano Limon field, operated by Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY), were unaffected.
The 485-mile (780-km) pipeline was stopped for six months earlier this year because of repeated attacks and crude theft, before restarting on July 10.
The ELN, considered a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union, has about 1,500 combatants and opposes multinational companies, claiming they seize natural resources without benefiting Colombians.

AMALIA, N.M. (Reuters) - One of the leading members of a group prosecutors accused of abusing children at a New Mexico compound struggled with his plan to live off the grid after he underestimated a harsh mountain desert climate and settled on the wrong plot of land.
Relatives and neighbors say things began to go downhill for Lucas Morton, 39, shortly after he arrived in this vast alpine valley about 40 miles (64 km) north of Taos in a white moving van last December.
His brother-in-law Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, wanted in Georgia for child abduction, soon joined them together with his wife, sister and children.
The families set up home on a 10-acre plot of land that was near to one owned by Morton, a carpenter, but which actually belonged to a U.S. Army veteran. The vet filed a court complaint but the Morton and Wahhaj families stayed on the land. 
With snow and bitter north winds, the families began to suffer. At the suggestion of neighbors, Morgan dug a hole and put a camping trailer in it to seek shelter. 
Land is cheap in the valley, around $850 an acre, but winter temperatures can drop to -30 Fahrenheit (-34 C). Attempts at communal living in northern New Mexico have struggled or failed, going back to 1970s' communes.
The adults and 11 children used wood to cook, hauled water from neighbors' wells and got heat from propane heaters. Their shelters kept blowing away, a neighbor said. 
Morton was one of five adults arrested at the compound on Aug. 3 on child abuse charges and accused by prosecutors of giving weapons training to a child to carry out school shootings. 
No-one was specifically charged over the school shooting accusation and Defense Attorney Aleksandar Kostich told reporters that prosecutors had provided no evidence of the allegation, which came from a foster parent who is caring for one of the children. 
Morton was also charged with harboring a felon, Ibn Wahhaj, who was armed with an AR-15 rifle, five magazines of ammunition, and four handguns when arrested, according to police. 
Ibn Wahhaj is accused of abducting his seriously-ill, three-year-old son Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj in December from his mother in Georgia. On Monday a body, believed to be that of the boy was found buried at the compound, police said. 
Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe first referred to the suspects as ""extremist of the Muslim belief,"" but declined to elaborate when later asked about it by reporters. 
Public defenders representing the five adults, who are in Taos County jail, did not respond to requests for comment. 
'GET OUT OF SOCIETY'
Morton and his 15-year-old nephew Mohammed last November attended a four-week, $2,500 course in Taos on how to build an ""earthship"" - an eco house made largely of earth-filled tires.
""All they wanted to do was get out of society, get away, homestead and live a peaceful life by themselves,"" said Morton's father Gerard Jabril Abdulwali, 64.
Inside Morton's abandoned van at the compound, ""I love my family"" is written over hearts drawn on the first page of a notebook belonging to ""Aisha,"" one of his four children. 
There are signs the group made friends locally. 
A local man gave Morton hundreds of tires to build an earthship home. A neighbor gave him wood to build bunk beds, and another helped them hook up solar panels.
These people said police drones began to circle the area in late May or June. Badger told local media he had earlier informed Georgia police that the abducted boy was at Morton's home. 
In the next months the home began to look more like a compound. The families stacked tires around it and built what look like defensive walls. A 150-foot tunnel leads to what appear to be escape holes among sagebrush and chamisa bushes. 
""I got the feeling Lucas didn't want what he was in anymore,"" said neighbor Tyler Anderson, 41, a car-body technician, who showed Morton how to wire up solar panels. 
Anderson said near daily target shooting at the house stopped once the drones appeared. 
The arrests at the compound made one neighbor, who described himself only as ""Quincy,"" stand at his gate and cry.
He and other locals disputed police reports the Morton and Wahhaj children were found ragged and starving.
""I made sure everyone in that place had shoes and clothes. They weren't hungry,"" said the man. 

Morton's wife Subhannah Wahhaj, 35, regularly went grocery shopping with Quincy's wife. Their last trip, was on Aug. 2, Quincy said. Police launched the raid the next day.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Police charged a man in the deaths of four people, including two police officers, and identified the civilians killed in a shooting on Friday in the eastern Canadian city of Fredericton.
Police charged Matthew Vincent Raymond, 48, with four counts of first degree murder, according to a statement on Saturday. They identified the civilian victims as Bobbie-Lee Wright, 32, and Donald Adam Robichaud, 42. 
Police did not release information about a possible motive or the weapon.
The four people killed, including police officers Sara Mae Burns, 43, and Lawrence Robb Costello, 45, were shot at an apartment complex in Fredericton, capital of the province of New Brunswick. [L1N1V11UR]
Police said the officers responded to a report of shots fired early on Friday morning and found two civilian victims on the ground. 
Sean Callahan said he grew up with one of the victims, his cousin Donald Robichaud, in rural New Brunswick. Robichaud, a musician and father of three, had recently begun a new relationship with Wright, Callahan said. 
""Donnie’s probably the best person you could ever meet in your whole life. The kindest person,” Callahan said by telephone from Fredericton. “Who in the hell would want to shoot Donnie Robichaud?""
According to their Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) pages, a Fredericton man named Donnie Robichaud was in a relationship with Bobbie-Lee Wright.
The dead police officers were Burns, who had served two years on the force and another two as an auxiliary officer, and who had three children; and Costello, a 20-year veteran who left behind four children.
Friday's shooting was the latest eruption of gun violence across the country. Gun laws in Canada are stricter than in the United States, but a proliferation of weapons has led to an increase in gun-related crimes in recent years.

The shooting occurred three weeks after a gunman walked down a busy Toronto street, killing two people and wounding 13 before killing himself.

More than 30,000 personnel, including firefighters from across the United States and nearly 140 from Australia and New Zealand, were battling the blazes that have consumed more than 1.6 million acres (648,000 hectares), according to the National Interagency Coordination Center.
""We are expecting that there will be more fire-starts today,"" Jeremy Grams, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center in Oklahoma, said in an interview on Saturday.
He said dry thunderstorms, which produce lightning but little rain, are expected for parts of the Rocky Mountain region, while the U.S. northwest has critical fire weather conditions that include strong winds and low relative humidity.
Firefighters were battling another day of extremely hot temperatures and strong winds on Saturday, the National Interagency Coordination Center said.
The fires have scorched states from Washington to New Mexico, with California among the hardest hit. 
A mechanic helping to fight the Carr Fire near Redding in northern California was killed in a car crash on Thursday, the eighth person to die in that conflagration.
The 181,000-acre (73,250-hectare) Carr Fire has destroyed nearly 1,100 homes.
About 100 miles (160 km) southwest of the Carr Fire, about 3,500 firefighters are battling the Mendocino Complex Fire, which has burned 325,226 acres (131,614 hectares) as of Saturday and was the largest fire on record in California.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull will this week be forced to confront internal divisions as the government convenes for the first time since it suffered a series of electoral defeats that threatens its prospect for re-election.
Turnbull will front a meeting of the centre-right coalition on Tuesday as parliament resumes after a six-week recess, a conference that comes amid renewed pressure on the prime minister.
""The jitters will be creeping into the party room. There is the doubt that when polled, Australians don't really believe he is the man for the job,"" said Haydon Manning, a political science professor at Flinders University in the state of South Australia.
Turnbull has been under sustained pressure amid a slump in opinion polls, stoking speculation of a leadership change in a country that has seen five different prime ministers since 2010.
Australia's conservative government late last month failed to win any of the five by-elections held across the country, defeats widely seen as an indication Turnbull faces an uphill task to be re-elected at a national poll due by May 2019.
Exit polls showed Turnbull's government had lost support with its planned corporate tax cuts.
Following the lead of the United States, Australia’s centre-right government has proposed to cut the corporate tax rate from 30 percent to 25 percent, in a bid to boost the economy less than a year away from the next election. 
But with stagnant wage growth and a public inquiry exposing alleged misconduct in the financial sector, the policy is deeply unpopular.
Turnbull has said his coalition will seek to win favor with the country's senate, where the government does not enjoy a majority, for the legislation - though the government's long-term commitment to the policy remains uncertain.
Turnbull will also head into the next session of parliament with uncertainty shrouding the government's energy policy.
The government had hoped to win approval from Australia's state governments for a plan to end more than a decade of climate and energy wars and spur investment in new power supply. 
But at a meeting last week, several states withheld support, setting the scene for a frosty meeting of the government on Tuesday.
Pro-coal former Prime Minister Tony Abbott and rural-party Nationals members in Turnbull's coalition oppose the plan, which is likely to dominate agenda of the meeting.
Australia's Treasurer Scott Morrison on Saturday acknowledged tensions within the room but insisted the coalition would provide Turnbull's energy plan.

""Of course there will be discussions, but it will have strong support because it is the right plan,"" Morrison told reporters in Adelaide.

BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romanians protested against corruption in Bucharest and major provincial cities for a second day running on Saturday, demanding the Social Democrat government's resignation.
The demonstrations were peaceful but on Friday, riot police fired tear gas and used water cannon on a huge rally in central Bucharest. Hundreds of people including many Romanians who work in western Europe and police officers needed medical attention.
About 40,000 people gathered in front of government offices in the capital on Saturday evening - fewer than the 100,000 the previous night, shouting ""Resignation!, Resignation!"", blowing vuvuzelas and waving Romanian and European Union flags. 
Romania, a country of 20 million which hosts a U.S. ballistic missile defense station, remains among the poorest and most corrupt members of the EU.
Several more thousands protesting against graft and politicians' attempts to decriminalize several corruption offenses gathered in the Transylvanian cities of Cluj, Sibiu and Brasov, in Timisoara on the border with Serbia, and in the eastern city of Iasi.
Peaceful rallies have repeatedly been held since the Social Democrats took power in early 2017 and tried to decriminalize several graft offences.
Earlier this year, ruling party legislators pushed changes to the criminal code through parliament, drawing expressions of concern from the European Commission and the U.S. State Department. The changes are being challenged in the Constitutional Court.
Social Democrat chief and lower house speaker Liviu Dragnea was sentenced to three and a half years in prison by the Supreme Court in June for incitement to abuse of office, a ruling which is not final pending an appeal.
In an open letter, Dragnea, who is seen as de facto head of the government, said his party and government would not bow to public pressure to resign.

""I want to assure all Romanians that parliament will not allow anybody to dissolve democracy, suspend individual rights and freedoms, change the outcome of the elections and overthrow order in the Romanian state through violence,"" he wrote.

He wrote his first novel while at Oxford, but it was not published. He left university in 1954 and found a job as a cataloguer in London's National Portrait Gallery.
His first published novel, ""The Mystic Masseur"", written in 1955, was poorly received at first but the following year won the first of his literary awards, the John Llewellyn Rhys Memorial Prize for young authors.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan said on Saturday four people were killed during a police raid on a house sheltering militants suspected of being behind a bomb attack on a police van a day earlier.
Security forces stormed a building in the city of Salt where suspects behind the planting of the home-made bomb that killed one policeman on Friday were believed to be hiding.
Government spokeswoman Jumana Ghunaimat told the state news agency Petra that three suspects had been arrested so far in an operation that was still underway against a cell hiding in a building in the center of hillside Salt city, about 30 km (18 miles) west of Amman.
The suspects had refused to hand themselves over to the security forces and blown up part of the hilltop building, Ghunaimat added.
Later Ghunaimat said security forces were moving to seize the site and see if there were any civilians held hostage.
Witnesses heard several strong explosions near the site which a security source said were explosives being detonated by the police as they closed in on the militants.
Police had earlier blamed a gas canister for Friday's blast near the site of a music festival in the town of Fuheis. 
Ambulances were seen rushing to the main city hospital from near the building in a residential area of Salt that was sealed off by police. 
Several incidents over the past few years have jolted the Arab kingdom, which has been comparatively unscathed by the uprisings, civil wars and Islamist militancy that have swept the Middle East since 2011.
Militants from al Qaeda and other radical jihadist groups have long targeted the U.S.-allied kingdom and dozens of militants are currently serving long prison terms.
Jordan earlier this year said it had foiled an Islamic State plot that included plans for a series of attacks last November on security installations, shopping malls and moderate religious figures, state media reported.
Security forces have been extra vigilant since the start of this year with warnings that sympathisers of Islamic State could launch revenge attacks after the militants were driven out of most of the territory they once controlled in Syria and Iraq.
King Abdullah, a Middle East ally of Western powers against Islamist militancy who has also safeguarded Jordan’s peace treaty with Israel, has been among the most vocal leaders in the region in warning of threats posed by radical groups.

Jordan plays a prominent role in the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, providing military, logistical and intelligence support, according to Western diplomats and regional intelligence sources.

Saudi Arabia has in recent months detained several women's rights activists, some of whom had campaigned for the right to drive and an end to the kingdom's male guardianship system.
The detentions have triggered a major diplomatic row with Canada after the Canadians demanded the immediate release of the jailed activists.
The European Commission, the EU executive, said it has contacted Saudi Arabia.

About 20 fishing boats set sail from Gaza City port toward the maritime border with Israel. The Gaza Health Ministry said there were no casualties reported.
An Israeli military spokeswoman said the navy gave the boats verbal warnings before firing in to the air. 
Palestinian witnesses said some of those on board set tyres alight and set them afloat toward the maritime border before they were confronted by four Israeli naval vessels.
Israel says its naval blockade of Gaza is intended to prevent weapons from reaching militant groups, including Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the Palestinian enclave. Israel and the West designate Hamas as a terrorist organization.
More than 2 million Palestinians are packed into the Gaza Strip, which is experiencing deep economic hardship.
Israel and Egypt, citing security concerns, keep tight restrictions on their land crossings with Gaza which have reduced its economy to a state of collapse.
U.N. and Egyptian-led efforts are under way to mediate a long-term ceasefire between Israel and Hamas who have fought three wars since 2008. The bid is also meant to tackle humanitarian issues in Gaza and improve its economy.
Adham Abu Selmeya, one of the flotilla organizers, said the event was meant to send a message to all parties involved in the ceasefire efforts.
""We want the world to see the reality of the blockade and the suffering of the people of Gaza, and we will not accept anything less than lifting the blockade once and for all,"" he said.
Cross-border violence has spiked in the past few months. Since the weekly protests began on March 30, the Israeli army has killed 161 Palestinians and a Gaza sniper has killed an Israeli soldier.
On Thursday, Egyptian mediation ended a two-day wave of rocket barrages and air strikes between Israel and Gaza militant groups.

The rial currency has lost about half of its value since April under the threat of revived U.S. sanctions, with heavy demand for dollars among ordinary Iranians trying to protect their savings.
The cost of living has also soared, sparking sporadic demonstrations against profiteering and corruption, with many protesters chanting anti-government slogans.
The central bank and the judiciary have blamed ""enemies"" for the fall of the currency and a rapid rise in the price of gold coins, and the judiciary has said more than 40 people including a former central bank deputy have been arrested on charges carrying the death penalty.
The judiciary has suggested that arch-foes the United States and Israel as well as regional rival Saudi Arabia and government opponents living in exile are fomenting the unrest.
""The current special economic conditions are considered an economic war,"" judiciary chief Ayatollah Sadeq Amoli Larijani said in a letter to Khamenei, calling for the setting up of special courts to deal quickly with financial crimes, the television report said.
Khamenei agreed, saying: ""The purpose (of the courts) should be to punish those guilty of corrupt economic practices swiftly and justly,"" the TV added. ""The courts should be advised to (ensure) the accuracy of their rulings."" 
New Islamic revolutionary courts will be set up for two years and directed to impose maximum sentences on those ""disrupting and corrupting the economy"", and appeal rights will be curbed, Amoli Larijani proposed in his letter, read on state television.
In May, the United States pulled out of a 2015 deal between world powers and Tehran under which international sanctions on Iran were lifted in return for curbs on its nuclear program.
Washington this week reimposed sanctions on Iran’s purchase of U.S. dollars, its trade in gold and precious metals and its dealings with metals, coal and industrial-related software.

The United States has told other countries they must halt imports of Iranian oil from early November or face U.S. financial measures.

1431,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2018 02:39PM ET</span>",Clashes continue as Taliban press Afghan city south of Kabul,"KABUL (Reuters) - Fighting continued around Ghazni in central Afghanistan on Saturday, a day after Taliban fighters stormed the city in a stark show of force, with at least 25 police and one journalist killed, officials said.
Many telecoms masts were destroyed during heavy fighting on Friday, making it difficult to establish contact with the city, some two hours drive south of the capital Kabul, and there were conflicting accounts from government and Taliban spokesmen.
The attack on Ghazni, a strategically important center straddling the main highway linking Kabul with the south of the country, was the most serious blow struck by the Taliban since they came close to overrunning the western city of Farah in May.
The insurgents have failed to take any provincial center since they briefly seized the northern city of Kunduz in 2015 although they are active across much of the country and control many rural areas.
Defense ministry officials said Ghazni was under complete control of the security forces. But at the same time, they said clearance operations were continuing and additional troops were being sent to boost the city's defense.
""Afghan National Army reinforcements are making their way to Ghazni city to help the Afghan National Police search and clear the city of insurgents that may still be hiding in the city,"" said Major Mohammad Farooq, Afghan army 203rd Corps spokesman.
However, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the insurgents held a number of strategic locations in the city and had captured a large quantity of weapons and equipment as well as taking more than 100 prisoners among the security forces.
""We are in talks in various areas with the rest of the enemy forces to surrender instead of putting their lives in danger,"" he said in a statement.
One security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said both sides were fighting to control commercial centers and arterial roads around the city. 
There was little clear information on casualties, but Najib Danish, a spokesman for the interior ministry, said that 25 policemen had been killed, along with one Afghan journalist, whom he did not identify.
Friday's attack came as a shock after hopes had grown of a possible start to peace talks, although Ghazni has been under pressure for months with insurgents increasingly active in nearby districts.
""The city was relatively quiet last evening and people were observed moving freely on the streets,"" Lt Col. Martin O'Donnell, spokesman for U.S. Forces-Afghanistan, said in an emailed statement. ""That said, clearing operations are ongoing and we have received reports of sporadic clashes.""
He did not say whether U.S. aircraft, which had helped Afghan forces resist the initial attack on Friday, had conducted any strikes against the Taliban.
The government had been considering a ceasefire over this month's Eid al Adha holiday to match a similar truce during the Eid al Fitr holiday in June which saw unarmed Taliban fighters mingling with soldiers on the streets of Kabul and other cities.

Zabihullah Mujahid said in a social media post that the group had captured Ghazni's main prison and freed many inmates, but Afghan officials could not immediately confirm or reject the statement.

The attack was carried out by militiamen from the group Mai Mai Malaika on Thursday in the Tubangoyi forest about 35 km (22 miles) from the mine in Democratic Republic of Congo's Maniema province, local army spokesman Dieudonne Kasereka told Reuters. 
""The two people killed are not Banro workers but passengers that the drivers picked up along the road. For the moment, the hostages have not been found but the Congolese army has launched operations to recover them,"" Kasereka said.
He added that the hostages were two drivers and two soldiers who were protecting the trucks. 
Banro did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Repeated attacks by the Mai Mai on Namoya and Banro's Twangiza mine in neighbouring South Kivu province in the past two years threw the Canadian company's survival into question late last year.
It was delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange in January but is pursuing a recapitalisation plan to continue its operations.
Militias like the Mai Mai, who believe blessed water has magical properties like protecting fighters from bullets, have preyed on eastern Congo's population and exploited mineral resources since the end in 2003 of a regional war that killed millions, most from hunger and disease.
Mai Mai Malaika is one of several groups allied with another militia in the zone called Mai Mai Yakutumba, which briefly threatened to capture the city of Uvira last September before being pushed back by Congolese and U.N. forces.

(Reuters) - Federal authorities on Saturday were seeking to learn what drove an airline worker to steal an empty airplane from Seattle's airport in a security scare that caused the scrambling of U.S. fighter jets and ended when the plane crashed onto a sparsely populated island.
A Horizon Air ground service agent got into a Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft on Friday night in a maintenance area at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and took off, Horizon sister carrier Alaska Airline said. 
He flew for about one hour, often erratically, before crashing on Ketron Island in Puget Sound, about 25 miles (40 km) to the southwest. 
The 29-year-old man, who has not been named, was suicidal and appeared to have acted alone, according to the Pierce County Sheriff's Department, which said the employee was believed to have been killed in the crash. 
""Doing stunts in air or lack of flying skills caused crash into Island,"" the Sheriff's Department said on Twitter. 
In partial recordings of his conversations with air traffic controllers that were published online by Broadcastify.com, the man said he was sorry to disappoint people who cared about him and described himself as a ""broken guy.""
""Got a few screws loose, I guess,"" he is heard saying in the recording. ""Never really knew it until now.""
The Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the incident.
""Until the FBI has the opportunity to get better background on the person, find out what motive they had, it's a little too early to make a determination on what the objective was,"" Debra Eckrote, the NTSB's western Pacific region chief, said at a news conference.
Two F-15 fighter jets took to the air from a base in Portland, Oregon, and were on the scene within minutes. The jets were armed but did not open fire, North American Aerospace Defense Command spokesman Cameron Hillier said by phone.
Instead, the F-15 pilots and air traffic controllers tried to guide the plane west, away from populated areas, said Hillier. No one was hurt on the ground, authorities said.
It was unclear how the employee was able to taxi the plane on a runway and take off without authorization.
""We're working to find out everything we possibly can about what happened,"" Brad Tilden, chief executive of  Alaska Air  Group (N:ALK), said in a statement. 

The Bombardier Q400 turboprop is designed for short-distance flights and can seat 76 passengers, Alaska Air said.

The killing last month of Bishop Epiphanius, a 64-year-old scholar who had led the Abu Makar Monastery in Wadi Natroun, an area some 110 km (68 miles) northwest of Cairo, prompted the church to impose strict new measures on its clergy.
Lawyer Ameer Naseef told Reuters that an Alexandria prosecutor on Friday charged Wael Saad, a monk who was known as Isaiah al-Makari before he was stripped of his religious title, with the July 29 killing. 
Officials from the prosecutor's office were not immediately available, but judicial sources confirmed the report.
""The prosecution's decision came yesterday, on Friday, and it (the prosecution) asked that his remand be renewed on time,"" Naseef told Reuters, adding that this would be done on Sunday.
Christians in Egypt make up an estimated 10 percent of its roughly 96 million population.
The church had earlier said that Saad had been investigated over alleged long-standing violations of his duties as a monk, but denied that he had been suspected of involvement in Bishop Epiphanius' killing.
The case has prompted the head of the Coptic church, Pope Tawadros II, to launch sweeping measures to combat what some Christian figures have described as violations of the principles of poverty and chastity.
The measures include a freeze on accepting new monks, a ban on monks leaving monasteries without official permission and a ban on clergy using social media.
Tawadros II and other clerics have since closed down their social media accounts.

1435,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2018 01:03PM ET</span>","Turkey is a 'target of economic war', Erdogan says","By Humeyra Pamuk
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan denied on Saturday that Turkey is in a currency crisis, dismissing a plunge in the lira as 'fluctuations' which have nothing to do with economic fundamentals.
Speaking after U.S. President Donald Trump doubled tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminum imports, Erdogan described Friday's 18 percent fall in the lira to a record low as the 'missiles' of an economic war waged against Turkey.
Erdogan said those who plotted against Turkey in a failed coup attempt in July 2016 were now trying to target the country through its economy, and pledged to fight back. He did not name any countries.
""Those who can't compete with us on the ground have brought online fictional currency plots that have nothing to with the realities of our country, production and real economy,"" Erdogan told a provincial meeting of his AK Party in the Black Sea coastal town of Rize.
""The country is neither crumbling, nor being destroyed or bankrupt or in a crisis,"" he said, and added that the way out of the 'currency plot' was to boost production and 'minimize interest rates'.
The Turkish lira has lost about 40 percent this year alone, largely over worries about Erdogan's influence over the economy, his repeated calls for lower interest rates in the face of high inflation and deteriorating ties with the United States.
The two governments have been at odds over a wide range of topics - from diverging interests in Syria, to Turkey's ambition to buy Russian defense systems, and the case of evangelical pastor Andrew Brunson, who is on trial in Turkey on terrorism charges.
Erdogan also appeared to allude to a 'deadline' for handing over Brunson, although he did not name the United States as having set any such deadline or say precisely when it might have expired. ""(They are) threatening, saying you will send (him) until 6 pm ... This is not some random country. This is Turkey,"" he said.
A Turkish delegation visited Washington for talks this week but left with no signs of a breakthrough.
After almost 20 months in a Turkish jail, Brunson was moved to house arrest in July by a court. Since then Trump and his vice president Mike Pence have repeatedly called for his release while Ankara said the decision was up to the courts.
Washington in response sanctioned two Turkish ministers and Trump on Friday announced it was doubling the tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Turkey, saying relations with Ankara were ""not good at this time"".
LANGUAGE OF THREATS
An important emerging market, Turkey borders Iran, Iraq and Syria and has been mostly pro-Western for decades. Financial upheaval risks further destabilizing an already volatile region.
A meeting on Friday unveiling a new economic approach by Turkey's finance minister Berat Albayrak, Erdogan's son-in-law, did little to offer support for the free-falling lira as investors sought concrete steps such as an interest rate increase to restore confidence.
""I am asking you. What possible reason could there be behind the lira which was at 2.8 against dollar in July 15, 2016 to slide below 6 yesterday? During this period, Turkey has set records in its exports, production and employment,"" Erdogan said.
He repeated a long-standing plan to shift to trading in national currencies and said Turkey was preparing for such a step with Russia, China and Ukraine.
He also repeated his call to Turks to sell their dollar and euro savings to shore up the lira. ""If there are dollars under your pillow, take these out... Immediately give these to the banks and convert to Turkish lira and by doing this, we fight this war of independence and the future,"" he said.
He also said it was a pity that Washington chose Brunson over Turkey, its partner in NATO, and in an opinion piece in the New York Times, he warned the United States that Ankara had other alternatives as allies.
Washington ""must give up the misguided notion that our relationship can be asymmetrical"", he said in the opinion piece.
Turkey, home to the Incirlik air base which is used by U.S. forces in the Middle East, has been a NATO member since the 1950s. It is host to a critical part of the Western alliance's missile defense system against Iran.
In a separate opinion piece in the pro-government newspaper Daily Sabah, Erdogan's spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said Turkey's efforts to solve the crisis with diplomatic methods had been dismissed by the Trump administration, warning that ""the U.S. runs the risk of losing Turkey"" as an ally.

""The entire Turkish public is against U.S. policies that disregard Turkey's legitimate security demands. Threats, sanctions and bullying against Turkey will not work,"" he said.

The Independent Electoral Complaints Commission (IECC) issued a statement with the names of the disqualified candidates - including serving MPs - after it said they were found to have direct links with illegal armed groups.
Most of those barred have already lodged appeals against the move.
Officials at the IECC said the final list was the result of a month-long probe launched after its office received complaints against hundreds of candidates from voters in 34 provinces.
Some candidates were alleged to have been involved in cases of murder, rape and extortion.
""We disqualified the candidates because we want to clean the process and finally hold free and fair elections,"" said Alirez Rohani, the spokesman of IECC.
October's vote, already much-delayed, is seen as a crucial test for democracy in a country that has been at war for four decades. It comes amid increasing attacks by Taliban and Islamic State insurgents, however, who have threatened to target the electoral process.
The polls are seen as a dry run for next year's presidential election and a key test of the credibility of President Ashraf Ghani's government, which has been under pressure from its international backers to ensure the vote takes place after the last presidential election in 2014 was deemed to have been tainted by fraud.
Diplomats tracking the upcoming elections said they backed the IECC to ensure transparency and accuracy. 
But the latest decision will trigger political turmoil, particularly as some of those named are influential lawmakers and strongmen.
Most of the disqualified candidates have lodged appeals against the decision and were planning to launch a nationwide protest against the IECC.
""The IECC did not even provide the opportunity to the disqualified candidates to defend themselves,"" said Fawzia Kofi, a lawmaker from Badakhshan province on the list.
Kofi, who has been accused of funding an armed group to retain control over her constituency, has rejected the allegations against her.
""These are politically motivated accusations. My supporters will start a protest march to prove my innocence,"" Kofi said.

U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis has notified Congress that the department plans to return the Bells of Balangiga to the Philippines at a date yet to be identified, the U.S. Embassy in Manila said in a statement on Saturday.
Despite decades of close ties between the two countries and a tight military alliance, the United States' refusal to return the bells has long been a bone of contention, raised strongly by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.
In 1901, U.S. soldiers killed thousands of Filipinos, including women and children in the central Philippines town of Balangiga in response to the death of 48 U.S. soldiers at the hand of rebels during the war between the two countries.
U.S. troops took the town's church bells. Two of the bells are at the Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming, while the third is part of a traveling museum.
""We are aware that the Bells of Balangiga have deep significance for a number of people, both in the United States and in the Philippines,"" the embassy said.

A local prosecutor on Saturday said the two men faced charges of unintentionally causing injuries and putting lives in danger, as well as establishing a campsite without authorization. 
Rescuers evacuated more than 180 people from the site in Saint-Julien-de-Peyrolas, north of Avignon, after torrential rain on Thursday transformed the Ardeche river into a raging torrent of muddy water.
Divers have not found a 66-year-old holidaymaker who sought refuge from the swollen river in his caravan, only to be swept away. [nL5N1V0743]
Lawyers for the two men could not be reached for comment. They were already facing legal proceedings filed by the local authorities for breaching planning regulations.
""We're confident that the camp site was located in a flood zone and that the town hall had alerted the owners of this and the danger that represented,"" said Eric Maurel, the Nimes prosecutor.
""On the very day of the incident, the town hall again signaled the immediate danger and they still did not clear the site, unlike other nearby campsites,"" the prosecutor added.
Under France's legal system, a suspect is not formally charged with a crime unless sent to trial. Saturday's move by the judge puts the two men a step closer to that.

Iran has been trying to implement standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global group of government anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-financing of terrorism regimes (CFT), in the hope it will be removed from a blacklist that makes some foreign investors reluctant to deal with it.
In June, FATF said Iran had until October to complete the reforms or face consequences that could further deter investors from the country, which has already been hit by the return of U.S. sanctions this week. 
The Guardian Council, which vets legislation passed by parliament for compliance with Iran’s constitution, gave its approval to the legal amendments on combating the funding of terrorism, the council's spokesman, Abbas Ali Kadkhodaei, was quoted by the state news agency IRNA as saying.
Hardliners in parliament have opposed passing legislation aimed at moving towards compliance with FATF standards, arguing it could hamper Iranian financial support for allies such as Lebanon’s Hezbollah, which the United States has classified as a terrorist organization.
Saturday's approval came despite the clergy-dominated council's earlier objections to another set of amendments linked to money laundering.
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in June parliament should pass legislation to combat money laundering according to its own criteria. 
Foreign businesses say legislation that includes FATF guidelines is essential if they are to increase investment.

A spokesman for the health ministry said that a foreign object had exploded leading to the death of one person but no injuries, without elaborating on whether it was an attempted attack on the church.
Islamist militants have claimed several attacks on Egypt's large Christian minority in recent years, including two deadly bombings on Palm Sunday in April 2017 and a blast at Cairo's largest Coptic cathedral in December 2016 that killed 28 people.
The most recent attack came last December, when a gunman fired on worshippers at a Coptic Orthodox church in a Cairo suburb, killing 11 in an attack claimed by Islamic State.

KOCHI, India (Reuters) - More than half of the 14 districts in India's Kerala state have been put on high alert, officials said on Saturday, as the death toll from one of the worst floods in the southern state reached 34.
Torrential rains and landslides during India's June-September monsoon season have ravaged farmlands and prompted massive evacuation efforts in Kerala state.
Crops on 1,031 hectares (2547.66 acres) have been damaged and 31,000 people have been forced to take shelter in rescue camps, according to the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority's (KSDMA) control room in the state capital. 
A senior official there said eight districts had been put on varying levels of high alert.
Another government official previously told Reuters that crop worth 3.42 billion rupees ($49.65 million), across 26,824 hectares had been destroyed by rains since their onset on May 29.
P.H. Kurian, KSDMA's chief and a top state bureaucrat, said rains had eased.
""There was no rain in the catchment areas of major reservoirs today,"" Kurian said. ""However, we will continue our alert and preparedness till August 15.""
Federal home minister Rajnath Singh was expected to travel to the state on Sunday to take a stock of the relief and rescue operations, Kurian added.
Kerala state authorities have taken the unprecedented step of opening the gates of 25 water reservoirs to prevent potentially disastrous breaches. 
The state, which has 44 rivers, witnessed its worst floods in 1924 following torrential rains.
The weather department forecast heavy rains until August 15, India's Independence Day, also warning of flooding in low-lying coastal areas. Fishermen have been advised not to venture into the Arabian sea.

Despite the rains, tens of hundreds of Hindus across the state gathered on the banks of rivers and roads to perform a ritual in honor of their ancestors.

In a video posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Conte said his ministers would look to cut bureaucracy and make the battle against poverty a priority.
""From September important challenges await us, ones that are crucial to revive the country and our economy. To do this we are preparing a series of structural reforms fundamental for economic growth and social development,"" he said.
Among the planned measures were a simplification of rules surrounding the awarding of public works contracts, a new anti-corruption drive and moves to speed up the justice system, which, Conte said, was important for foreign investors.
He also promised a reform of the country's tax code and the introduction of the so-called ""citizens wage"", which, when it is fully operational, is meant to ensure income of up to 780 euros per month for the poor.
He added that his government, made up of the far-right League and anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, would ""adopt all the measures possible to combat absolute poverty"", which, he said, afflicted more than 5 million people in Italy.
Many of the measures are likely to be laid out in the 2019 budget, which must be presented to the European Union by mid-October. Financial markets have grown increasingly concerned that Italy will seek to break clear of EU-imposed spending restraints to pay for its ambitious plans. 
Conte did not address this point, but promised that the budget would not touch funding for ""strategic sectors"" such as health, education and research.
An unsourced report in la Repubblica newspaper on Saturday said Brussels was ready to give the government some fiscal leeway, meaning Italy could spend 8 billion euros ($9.1 billion) more than EU rules stipulated. 
In return, it wanted a commitment to reduce the structural deficit, which is adjusted for economic growth fluctuations, the paper reported.

Kenya last year inaugurated the more than $3 billion railway. No Chinese companies or individuals were named in the prosecutor's statement.
Kenya has been hit this year by a spate of scandals related to the alleged theft of hundreds of millions of Kenyan shillings (millions of dollars) by officials from government bodies. 

Haji, appointed by Kenyatta earlier this year, is bringing charges against dozens of state officials and businesspeople in a number of court cases that have not yet begun.

""This cowardly act will only increase the determination to do our job to protect people,"" the interior ministry statement said.

QUETTA, Pakistan (Reuters) - A suicide bomber attacked a bus ferrying Chinese mining workers in Pakistan's restive Baluchistan province on Saturday, a local official said, in an assault claimed by Baloch separatists.
The bomber died in the attack and the Chinese workers suffered minor wounds, the official said. Militant group Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the attack in Dalbandin, about 340 km (210 miles) south-west of the provincial capital, Quetta.
Baluchistan, which has rich mineral and natural gas reserves but remains Pakistan's poorest province, is the site of a long-running rebellion by separatists who argue the state is taking over their lands and have targeted Chinese-funded projects.
""A suicide bomber used an explosives laden pick-up for the attack. He exploded the (vehicle) when the coach reached the site,"" said Saifullah Khaterin, deputy commissioner for Chagai district in southwestern Baluchistan province, where the attack took place.
The blast shattered the glass windows in the bus and damaged the front of the vehicle, according to images from the scene seen by Reuters.
The Chinese workers targeted in this attack worked on the Saindak mining project, which is controlled by Chinese state-owned Metallurgical Corporation of China (MCC), according to a senior official who works for MCC. Eighteen Chinese workers were on the bus when the attack happened.
Tens of thousands of Chinese workers are living in Pakistan and most work on infrastructure projects that fall under the Beijing-funded $57 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a key leg in China's vast Belt and Road initiative to build transport and economic links across Asia and beyond.
The copper and gold Saindak project is Pakistan's biggest functioning mine, but not part of CPEC.
Chinese officials have urged Pakistan to improve security in Baluchistan, which houses a vital sea port being built by China in the coastal city of Gwadar, and has a key road artery passing through it as part of the CPEC transport corridor.
BLA released a video of the attack, including a message from the alleged suicide bomber who carried out the bombing.

Griffiths is trying to negotiate an end to the three-year conflict that has killed more than 10,000 people and pushed Yemen to the verge of starvation.
Air strikes by a Saudi-led coalition killed dozens of children traveling on a bus in the northern province of Saada on Thursday. U.N. chief Antonia Guterres has called for an independent investigation of the raid.
Consultations are due to begin in Geneva on Sept. 6 on a framework for peace talks and confidence-building measures. 
""Primarily, we are trying to reach an agreement between the Yemeni government and (the Houthis') Ansarullah on the issues essential to ending the war and on a national unity government in which everyone participates,"" Griffiths told the Arabic-language Saudi-owned Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper.
""This will require a signed agreement that includes setting up a transitional political operation under a national unity government ... and putting in place security arrangements for the withdrawal of all armed groups in Yemen and disarming them.""
He said the consultations would lead to direct negotiations.
The coalition of Sunni Muslim Arab states backed by Western powers including the United States and Britain intervened in Yemen's civil war in 2015 against the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement to restore the internationally recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.
Griffiths efforts have succeeded so far in averting a full assault by the military alliance on the Houthi-held main port city of Hodeidah in western Yemen, but battles and attacks have continued in the impoverished Arab state where the Houthis control the most populated areas and the capital Sanaa.
Previous U.N.-sponsored peace talks have failed to end the conflict, widely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and regional foe Shi'ite Muslim Iran. 
The last round of talks in 2016 ended with Hadi's government walking out after the Houthis rejected a U.N. proposal calling on the group to quit three main cities, including Sanaa, ahead of talks to form a government.
Griffiths said discussions on a new government should also include representatives from the General People's Congress, once headed by slain former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, and the southern separatist movement, a powerful force that has provided many of the coalition-backed fighters against the Houthis.

""The future of the South will not be discussed in these consultations, but will be part of the Yemeni dialogue in the transitional period,"" Griffiths said, adding that the United Nations supported a united Yemen.

""A well-equipped terrorist group ... intending to infiltrate the country from the border area of Oshnavieh to foment insecurity and carry out acts of sabotage was ambushed and at least 10 terrorists were killed in a heavy clash,"" the Revolutionary Guards said in a statement carried by IRNA.
There has been sporadic fighting with Iranian Kurdish militant groups based in Iraq as well as Islamic State fighters near Iran’s porous border with Iraq.
In July, there were at least two clashes in the mountainous border area, in which at least 10 Guards and three militants were killed.
In 2017, Islamic State militants carried out coordinated attacks at the parliament building in Tehran and the mausoleum of Iranian revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini south of the capital, killing 18 people.

Asked about the likelihood of a meeting with U.S. officials, including Pompeo, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, Zarif said: ""No, no such meeting is planned. We have repeatedly announced our position,"" Tasnim reported.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani dismissed a U.S. call for talks without preconditions last Monday, hours before Washington moved to impose new sanctions in line with President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of a 2015 agreement over Iran's nuclear program.
""About the recent offer by Trump, our official position has been announced both by the president (Rouhani) and myself. The Americans lack honesty,"" Zarif was quoted as saying by Tasnim.
Asked whether a message from the United States was to be delivered to Iran by Omani officials, Zarif said: ""There is no such message,"" Tasnim reported.

The area is close to the Lebanese border. 
Syrian air defenses were activated in a similar way over west Damascus last Thursday night.
SANA suggested Israel was to blame for the incursions. 
""In the past few weeks, the Israeli enemy has attacked military positions,"" it said. 
Israel, concerned that Iran's growing presence in Syria poses a threat to its security, has struck dozens of Iranian and Iran-backed positions in Syria over the course of the country's seven-year conflict.

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Guatemala's attorney general and the U.N.-backed International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) moved on Friday to lift President Jimmy Morales' immunity so he can be investigated for alleged illicit campaign financing.
It is the third time that the attorney general and the CICIG, which has taken the lead in pursuing high-level corruption cases in Guatemala, have sought to remove Morales' immunity - which would require the support of two-thirds of Congress.
The attorney general and CICIG want to determine the origin of some $1 million in undeclared campaign financing Morales managed as secretary general of the conservative National Convergence Front (FCN) party he led from 2015 to 2016. Morales has denied any wrongdoing.
Attorney General Consuelo Porras said the request to strip Morales of his immunity came after new evidence had surfaced.
Morales said in a statement that he respected the rule of law, had left the ""new case against him"" in the hands of the institutions, and trusted the process would abide by the law and not be subject to political interests.
Under the leadership of Ivan Velasquez, a veteran Colombian prosecutor, the CICIG has investigated Morales' son and brother, before training its sights on him.
The Guatemalan president won office in 2015 running on a platform of honest governance after his predecessor Otto Perez Molina was forced to resign and was imprisoned in a multi-million dollar graft case stemming from a commission investigation.

1454,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 09:10PM ET</span>",Far-right German leader skeptical of Bannon's anti-EU push,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has poured cold water on plans by Steve Bannon, U.S. President Donald Trump's former political strategist, to forge a wide populist alliance to undermine the European Union.
""We're not in America,"" Alexander Gauland, one of two co-leaders of the anti-immigrant party, told the Funke Mediengruppe newspaper chain in an interview published on Saturday.
""The interests of the anti-establishment parties in Europe are quite divergent,"" he added in comments that amounted to a blunt rebuff to Bannon from one of Europe's most influential far-right parties.
The former Trump strategist last month announced he had created a Brussels-based political organization called The Movement to rally nationalist and populist voters in European Parliament elections next May, with a goal of undermining and paralyzing the bloc.
But Gauland said that while his co-leader Alice Weidel had met once with Bannon, he saw no possibility of cooperating with him. ""Mr Bannon will not succeed in forging an alliance of the like-minded for the European elections.""
He said the AfD only had close contacts with Austria's far-right Freedom Party (FPO), junior party in Austria's coalition government. Former AfD leader Frauke Petry had always wanted to work with France's National Front, but that had not worked out.
Gauland said his party was polling at 17 to 20 percent in recent surveys, and its support could grow beyond that as long as Chancellor Angela Merkel remained in power. 
The party won 12.6 percent of the vote in national elections last September, making it the third largest party and catapulting it into the German parliament for the first time.
Gauland said the AfD needed to grow stronger, but he expected it to be ready to take on a governing role in the medium-term.

Political experts say the party could become the strongest party in the eastern German states of Saxony and Brandenburg in regional elections next year, which will raise the question of whether mainstream parties will reverse course and agree to form coalitions with it.

""Had a very good phone call with @EmmanuelMacron, President of France. Discussed various subjects, in particular Security and Trade,"" Trump, who is vacationing at his New Jersey golf club, said on Twitter.
The two leaders discussed ""a broad range of trade and security issues, including the situation in Iran and the broader Middle East,"" the White House said in a statement.
The Elysee Palace said in a brief statement the two leaders discussed Syria, Iran and the Israel-Palestinian conflict, but did not mention trade.
Trump and Macron last met at a NATO summit in Brussels in July, where the U.S. president chastised members of the alliance that have not met its defense spending targets.
At the summit, Macron said France would met the NATO goal of spending 2.0 percent of GDP on defense by 2024. Trump caused an uproar when he pressed alliance members to reach the target by January.
On trade, the United States and the European Union are embroiled in a spat after Trump imposed tariffs on imports of aluminum and steel from France and other countries. The EU responded with retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. goods.
Trump had also threatened to impose tariffs on EU auto imports but reached an agreement to hold off on taking action after meeting with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker at the White House last month.
Macron and Trump are at odds over the U.S. decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions on Tehran. Trump tweeted this week that companies doing business in Iran will be barred from doing business in the United States.
Among large European companies that have suspended plans to invest in Iran after the U.S. action are France's oil major Total and its big carmakers PSA and  Renault  (PA:RENA).

In the Middle East, France opposed Trump's decision to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv.

(Reuters) - The mother of Michael Brown, the unarmed black teenager shot to death by a white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri, igniting months of protest and a national debate over race and law enforcement, said on Friday she is running for City Council.
Lezley McSpadden announced her candidacy at an emotionally charged rally surrounded by supporters, a day after the fourth anniversary of her son's death, which thrust the St. Louis suburb into the global spotlight as an emblem of troubled U.S. race relations.
McSpadden, a onetime grocery store worker who founded and runs a charitable foundation in her son's name dedicated to various social causes, had previously hinted at her intention to seek a City Council seat at an event in April.
She recounted on Friday how her son's death left her devastated but ultimately inspired her to run for office.
""It brought me down to my knees and made me feel crippled, as if I could do nothing else anymore from that moment,"" she said. ""I learned to walk again, and this is one of my first steps, running for Ferguson City Council of 2019.""
McSpadden, who earned her high school diploma last year at age 37, said her three main focuses would be community policing, economic equality and healthcare access, especially for children.
""I know a lot of people may ask what makes me qualified. But I'll tell you. If a mother had to watch her son lay in the street for 4 1/2 hours and watch a community be completely disrespected by elected officials that we elected, what would you do? You would stand up and you would fight too,"" she said.
She and her ex-husband, Michael Brown, Sr., settled a wrongful death lawsuit against the city last June over their son's killing.
Brown was gunned down on Aug. 9, 2014, by Officer Darren Wilson. He was 18 at the time. 
The shooting ignited weeks of racially charged protests, during which dozens were arrested.
The predominantly African-American community of 21,000, whose political leadership, police department and public school administration were dominated by whites, erupted in anger again after Wilson was spared from prosecution over Brown's death.
The turmoil touched off a national debate on discrimination in the criminal justice system, amplifying long-standing grievances about police harassment and mistreatment of minorities and giving rise to the Black Lives Matter movement.
Bob McCulloch, the St. Louis County prosecutor who was widely criticized after Brown's death, lost a primary election two days ago to Wesley Bell, a Ferguson city council member who has vowed criminal justice reform.

HAVANA (Reuters) - The leader of one of Cuba’s largest and most active opposition organizations was charged Friday with attempted murder after being held incommunicado for a week in eastern Cuba.
Jose Daniel Ferrer, leader of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), was charged with deliberately trying to run over an official from the ministry of the interior on Aug. 3, a spokesman for the group told Reuters by telephone.
According to Carlos Amel Oliva, a member of the UNPACU leadership, the incident was an accident and the official was only slightly injured.
Oliva said Ferrer, who does not have a driver's license, was on his way to visit his daughter with UNPACU member Ebert Hidalgo Cruz and had taken the wheel to practice driving when the official, in civilian clothing, stepped out in front of the car.
""He stepped out onto the road and he (Ferrer) braked and swerved and lightly hit the person who got up and mounted his motorcycle,"" Oliva said.
Ferrer is being held in preventive detention.
""The accusation is completely false. There are witnesses who say it was the official who stepped onto the road,"" Oliva said.
Hidalgo is also in custody, but has not yet been charged.
The Cuban government was not immediately available for comment.
Amnesty International demanded earlier on Friday, before the charges were made public, that the Cuban government clarify Ferrer’s status and allow him to see his family and obtain a lawyer.
The U.S. government demanded on Wednesday that the two men be released.
Cuba's Communist-run government considers all opponents to be agents of the United States and regularly detains them for a few hours to a few days.
UNPACU has been battling the government for years and a few of its members have been imprisoned for longer periods.

Ferrer was imprisoned in 2003, along with 74 other dissidents in a nationwide crackdown. He was released on parole in 2011 and soon after formed UNPACU.

The official, however, did not suggest that such a missile test was unusual during naval exercises or that it was carried out unsafely, noting it occurred in what could be described as Iranian territorial waters in the Strait.
Iran's Revolutionary Guards confirmed on Sunday it had held war games in the Gulf over the past several days, saying they were aimed at ""confronting possible threats"" by enemies.
U.S. Army General Joseph Votel, head of the U.S. military's Central Command, said earlier this week the scope and scale of the exercises were similar to ones Iran had carried out in the past. But the timing of this particular set of exercises was designed to get Washington's attention.
""It's pretty clear to us that they were trying to use that exercise to send a message to us that as we approach this period of the sanctions here, that they had some capabilities,"" Votel told reporters at the Pentagon.
Iran has been furious over U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of an international agreement on Iran's nuclear program and re-impose sanctions on Tehran. Senior Iranian officials have warned the country would not easily yield to a renewed U.S. campaign to strangle Iran's vital oil exports.
Last month, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei backed President Hassan Rouhani's suggestion that Iran may block Gulf oil exports if its own exports are stopped.
Votel said the U.S. military was keenly aware of Iran's military activities.
""We are aware of what's going on, and we remain ready to protect ourselves as we pursue our objectives of freedom of navigation and the freedom of commerce in international waters,"" Votel said.

1460,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 05:40PM ET</span>",A Canadian tweet in a Saudi king's court crosses a red line,"By David Ljunggren, Aziz El Yaakoubi and Katie Paul
OTTAWA/RIYADH/DUBAI (Reuters) - For years, Canadian pressure on human rights in Saudi Arabia had elicited no more than a standard rejection. But all that changed last week, when a Canadian complaint was translated into Arabic and set off a diplomatic row.
When Riyadh responded to a call from Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland to release civil society activists with an abrupt severing of diplomatic and trade ties, Canadian officials were left scrambling to understand what had happened. 
What Ottawa did not anticipate was that in the eyes of the Saudis they had crossed a red line.
On Aug. 2, Freeland tweeted https://twitter.com/cafreeland/status/1025030172624515072 in English and French, calling for the release of two jailed Saudi human rights activists. The following day, Canada's foreign affairs department sent another tweet https://twitter.com/CanadaFP/status/1025383326960549889, urging Saudi Arabia to ""immediately release"" those and other activists.
That was translated https://twitter.com/CanEmbSA/status/1026049114088333313 into Arabic by its embassy in Riyadh and sent out on Aug. 5 to its approximately 12,000 followers.
The reaction from Saudi Arabia was swift. Hours after the Arabic tweet, the Saudi government recalled its ambassador, barred Canada's envoy from returning and placed a ban on new trade.
Two Gulf sources said it was the tweet from the embassy that upset Saudi officials the most.
""Matters were being handled through usual channels but the tweet was a break with diplomatic norms and protocol,"" said one of the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The sources did not clarify exactly how the tweet broke with diplomacy, but regional experts said it was the step of sending it to a domestic audience that would have angered Saudi officials.
""The Saudi retaliation took some time to allow for political talks in closed doors,"" Salman al-Ansari, founder of the Washington-based Saudi American Public Relation Affairs Committee, said. 
""They thought the Canadians would take steps to back off, but all of a sudden they tweeted it in Arabic. This was a very provocative action by the Canadians to try to embarrass the Saudis in front of their people. The Saudis did not take this lightly at all.""
Saudi Foreign Minister Adel Jubeir raised the issue of the Arabic tweet in a call with Freeland on Tuesday, and complained about interference, a person familiar with the matter who declined to be named said.
Canadian officials say there was nothing remarkable about the Arabic tweet, which merely repeated Ottawa's stated position in a common practice for delegations abroad. 
Canada has raised the issue of civil society activist detentions before. As recently as May, Canada's Riyadh embassy tweeted in English its concern about activist arrests and said it was ""crucial that the rule of law"" be respected, with no public Saudi response.
'COLLATERAL DAMAGE'
The outsized reaction to the tweet underscores how the kingdom is taking a much harsher stance against what it perceives as Western interference in its internal affairs on issues like human rights, perhaps emboldened by Washington's willingness under Donald Trump to de-emphasize rights issues when it comes to its allies.
Riyadh and Washington have been enjoying an exceptionally close relationship  – tense during the administration of former U.S. President Barack Obama – as both Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Trump share similar concerns about Iran. By contrast, Trump and Trudeau locked horns during the G7 summit in June in an unusually public manner.
The U.S. State Department this week urged the two sides to use diplomacy to resolve the dispute.
""Canada is collateral damage,"" said Thomas Juneau, an assistant professor and Middle East expert at the University of Ottawa. ""This fundamentally is not about Canada. This is about Saudi Arabia wanting to send a broader message to its neighbors, to other democracies.""
Canadian foreign affairs officials including Freeland, who were gathered at a Vancouver hotel for a conference on Sunday, were taken aback by the Saudi reaction and left scrambling. Canada, government insiders said, was still unclear on what steps it can take to ""fix its big mistake"", as a Saudi official called it. 
""I don't think we have a conclusive understanding as of right now,"" said a Canadian government source. ""There may be the need for another call (between Freeland and Jubeir). We're also obviously talking to our partners about it. We do not wish to have bad relations with them (the Saudis).""
Inside Saudi Arabia, the measures were supported by a media campaign criticizing Canada's human rights record and praising the Saudi ruler's firmness in ""protecting the kingdom's sovereignty.""
Saudi state television channels aired reports on the struggle of indigenous people in Canada and said they had been historically subject to discrimination. Other reports listed ""the worst Canadian prisons"" and described harsh prison conditions.
Thousands of Twitter accounts bearing Saudi flags tweeted on the dispute, elevating the phrase ""Saudi Arabia expels the Canadian ambassador"" to one of the world's most popular hashtags. Many of the tweets used suspiciously similar language, often a sign of a coordinated campaign by bots, or automated accounts.

Saud al-Qahtani, a senior royal court adviser, tweeted a link announcing the decision to ban new trade on Monday along with the hashtag ""Saudi first"" - echoing a phrase popularized by Trump.

More than a million people have arrived in Colombia from Venezuela over the last year and a half, fleeing a severe economic and political crisis in the socialist country that has caused food and medicine shortages.
""We are going to insist on the strengthening of an emergency humanitarian fund and we are going to propose the creation of a special envoy under the United Nations who can coordinate the multilateral actions that are required because of the humanitarian crisis we are living,"" foreign minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo, who took office on Tuesday, told journalists.
Colombia has spent millions on aid for Venezuelan migrants, including food, shelter and medical care. Many arrive with only what they can carry and are often underfed.
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley on Wednesday announced an additional $9 million in aid to Colombia to help with the crisis, during a visit to the border city of Cucuta.
Trujillo said he had not yet received a formal extradition request from Venezuela for six people it has accused of involvement in the explosion of drones at a military event last week and who are believed to be in Colombia. Venezuela's government has said the incident was a failed assassination attempt.
""I don't like to talk about hypotheses - we'll see. ... I've been told the request for extradition has not formally arrived, if it's going to arrive,"" the minister said. ""If it arrives, we will review it.""
Trujillo reiterated that Colombia would withdraw from the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), created a decade ago in an attempt to counterbalance U.S. influence in Latin America, in tandem with several other nations. Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay and Peru have already indefinitely suspended their participation in the body.
""We're consulting with other countries which apparently want to take the same route. If we consolidate a similar decision from these consultations, we'll act in conjunction. If not, we'll withdraw anyway.""

The National Liberation Army (ELN), which has been in peace talks with the government for 17 months, is holding captive four soldiers, three policemen and two civilians who are contractors for the armed forces.
""As Colombia's president I will not accept that they intimidate us with kidnapping or that kidnapping becomes a mechanism to blackmail the Colombian state,"" Duque, who took office on Tuesday, said during a visit to the port city of Tumaco.
""If the ELN has a true desire for demobilization, disarmament and reinsertion, they should free those kidnapped quickly, without conditions,"" Duque added.
In a statement posted to its website on Friday, the guerrilla group said it was working to liberate those it kidnapped and that both Duque's government and the International Committee of the Red Cross, which usually acts as a neutral party to facilitate hostage releases, were receptive.
To complete the releases it would be necessary to agree to a set of protocols, the ELN statement added.
""We hope that the operations of the state army that are taking place in the area of the detentions do not put the lives of those detained at risk or are meant to carry out a rescue by force,"" the rebels said.
Three policemen, a soldier and the two civilians were kidnapped eight days ago in western Choco province, while three soldiers were captured this week in eastern Arauca province.
The government and the ELN failed to reach a ceasefire agreement at the end of their sixth round of talks at peace negotiations in Havana last week.
Colombia has been at war with the 1,500-member ELN, which was founded by radical Catholic priests, since 1964.
Duque has said he will not continue negotiations if the group does not halt criminal activity like drug trafficking and move its forces to a defined area of territory.

Colombia's conflict between the government, rebel groups, paramilitaries and crime gangs has lasted more than 50 years, killing at least 260,000 people and displacing millions.

(Reuters) - Pope Francis met in Rome on Friday with a Chilean bishop and a victims' advocate to discuss the Church sex abuse scandal in Chile and measures being taken to prevent it in the future. 
Bishop Juan Ignacio Gonzalez of San Bernardo and Ana Maria Celis Brunet, president of the Chilean National Council for the Prevention of Abuse and Accompaniment of Victims, met with the pope at the Vatican, it said in a statement. 
The scandal has rocked the Church in Chile. In June, the country's 34 bishops were summoned to Rome by the pope after Vatican investigators produced a 2,300-page report alleging that senior Church officials in Chile had failed to act on abuse claims and in some cases hid them.
Pope Francis has accepted resignations by five of those bishops.
The Vatican said that the pope has been closely following actions being taken by the Church in Chile to address the crisis.
Chilean prosecutor Emiliano Arias said on Thursday that the office of Bishop Santiago Silva, who serves as bishop to the armed services, had been raided as part of investigations into accusations that senior Roman Catholic Church officials covered up claims of sexual abuse by clergymen in Chile.
The raid was one of eight on offices of senior church figures as prosecutors search for evidence of accusations of sexual abuse by clergy not reported to the civilian police, and evidence of cover-ups, according to Arias.

ON BOARD THE AQUARIUS (Reuters) - A humanitarian ship rescued 141 migrants packed onto wooden boats off the coast of Libya on Friday in its first mission since it was caught in a standoff with Italy and Malta over their refusal to let rescued migrants ashore.
When Italy turned the Aquarius away in June and Malta followed suit, the ship spent a grueling nine days at sea before eventually disembarking the migrants in Spain. The row also drew in the European Union and France and political tensions have persisted between Rome and Paris since.
Run by Franco-German charity SOS Mediterranee and Doctors without Borders (MSF), the Aquarius rescued 25 migrants, including six women, from a small wooden boat about 25 nautical miles off the Libyan coast. 
Conditions were calm and sunny on Friday but the boat, weighed down by too many passengers, sat low above the water line. Those aboard looked tense and worried as the rescuers approached, handed them life jackets and helped the onto the humanitarian ship. 
Later 116 others were taken off a second wooden boat in the same area, including 38 women and 73 under the age of 18. Though larger, this vessel was also packed tight with passengers. Among them, a small frightened boy sat on the boat's rim, looking anxiously toward the rescuers. 
Both boats were spotted from the ship's bridge.
The Libyan coastguard was informed and is the coordinating authority of the rescues, the Aquarius wrote on its online ship's log. The Aquarius set out last week on its 10th mission this year after a two-month pause.
Italy's new government, which took power in June, refuses to take in migrants rescued by humanitarian ships, accusing them of acting as a ""taxi service"" in a bid to get EU partners to shoulder more of the burden of migrant arrivals. 
""In its callous refusal to allow refugees and migrants to disembark in its ports, Italy is using human lives as bargaining chips,"" Amnesty International's Matteo de Bellis said on Wednesday, condemning EU policies for the central Mediterranean.
The Aquarius has not yet been given a place of safety to disembark those rescued on Friday. According to international law, refugees cannot be put back in harm's way after being saved at sea.
""Aquarius is now waiting for instructions from the Libyan (rescue coordination center),"" the ship's digital log said. 
The crew made clear before setting out that it would not return migrants to Libya, which is not considered safe harbor for migrants and refugees by both the United Nations and the European Union.
Due to pressure from Italy and Malta, most charity ships are no longer patrolling off the coast of Libya. More than 650,000 migrants have come to Italy's shores since 2014. 
Though departures from Libya have fallen dramatically this year, people smugglers are still pushing some boats out to sea and an estimated 720 people died in June and July when charity ships were mainly absent, Amnesty International estimates.

1466,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 02:22PM ET</span>","Saudi-led coalition to probe Yemen air raid, Houthis report 40 children dead","SANAA/DUBAI/GENEVA (Reuters) - A Saudi-led Arab military coalition said on Friday it would investigate an air strike that killed dozens of children in Yemen, an apparent shift of stance on an attack Riyadh has portrayed as a legitimate action against its Houthi foes.
At least 40 children were killed in Thursday's strike on a bus in northern Yemen, the armed Houthi group which controls Yemen's capital said. That raised the toll of children killed in the raid from 29.
The strike by the Western-backed alliance of Arab countries outraged human rights groups and was strongly condemned by U.N. officials. Henrietta Fore, executive director of the U.N. Children's Fund UNICEF, said the ""horrific"" attack marked ""a low point in (Yemen’s) brutal war"".
People in Saada started to dig graves in preparation for funerals to be held on Saturday.
""God may give us patience,"" said Hussein Hussein Tayeb, who lost three sons on the bus, on a trip with other pupils to visit a mosque and tombs.
""I was one of the first to arrive on the scene, seeking to rescue the wounded; I lifted a body and I found that it was Ahmed's face. I hugged him, he was my son.""
Ahmed was 11. His brothers Yusef and Ali were 14 and 9.
U.N. chief Antonio Guterres called for an independent investigation of the raid which hit the bus as it drove through a market in Dahyan, a town in the Houthis' home province of Saada.
The U.N. Security Council on Friday called for a ""credible and transparent"" investigation after receiving a closed-door briefing on the strike by a senior U.N. official. 
A Reuters TV crew saw boys injured in the strike lying on beds in the Dahyan hospital, many with their heads wrapped. The face of one was covered in lacerations.
The Arab states carried out new air strikes on Friday, killing a girl and injuring several other people whose home was targeted in Marib province, east of the capital Sanaa, the Houthis' al-Masirah TV said.
Announcing the investigation into the strike on the bus, the Saudi Press Agency quoted an alliance official as saying: ""The coalition is firmly committed to investigating all claims regarding mistakes or violations of international law, to sanction those who caused these incidents and to provide assistance to the victims.""
The Saudi-led Arab alliance, whose members receive Western political support and buy billions of dollars a year in arms from the United States, Britain and France, has been fighting for three years to drive out the Houthis, Iran-aligned fighters who pushed a Saudi-backed government out of the capital in 2014.
Yemen is the poorest country in the Arabian peninsula, and the United Nations says the war has created the world's most urgent humanitarian disaster, with millions of people totally dependent on aid and at risk of famine if supply lines are cut.
""LEGITIMATE""
The Arab states initially said the air strikes on the bus were ""legitimate military action"" against missile launchers, carried out in accordance with international humanitarian law.
Houthi-run al-Masirah TV cited the group's health minister Taha Mutawakil as saying that the estimated number of casualties stood at 51 killed including 40 children, and at least 79 people wounded, of whom 56 were children.
The International Committee of the Red Cross reported the same toll on Friday, citing authorities in Saada. It had said on its Twitter account on Thursday that its medical team at the ICRC-supported hospital in Saada had received the bodies of 29 children, all under 15 years old. The hospital also received 48 wounded people, among them 30 children.
Masirah TV said on Friday the Houthis had fired a number of ballistic missiles at Saudi Arabia, targeting Jizan and Aseer provinces which lie at the border. Saudi Arabia intercepted two missiles fired at Jizan, Al-Arabiya TV reported.
The head of the Houthis' supreme revolutionary committee, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, hailed Friday's call by U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres for an independent investigation into the air strike.
In Paris, the French foreign ministry said France condemned the strike and backed a U.N. call to bring all parties in the war together for talks in Geneva on Sept. 6.
The Houthis have however barred without explanation the head of the U.N.'s human rights office in Yemen from returning to the country, a U.N. spokeswoman said on Friday.
Elobaid Elobaid, a Canadian citizen, had been based in Yemen since October 2016, leading 17 staff in Sanaa and 13 monitors in 11 of Yemen's governorates. His visa expired in June but was not renewed.

The U.N. human rights office has frequently accused all sides of violating international law and committing war crimes.

Northwestern Syria is the last big area still in the hands of fighters seeking to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad, after the government recaptured the area around Damascus and the southwest earlier this year.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said dozens of strikes from helicopters and war planes had hit parts of northern Hama province and southern Idlib province -- killing at least eight people -- and western Aleppo province -- killing at least 14 people. 
Syria's rebel-held northwest borders Turkey and includes Idlib province, part of Hama province and part of Aleppo province. Idlib is its main city.
Rebel-held parts of northern Hama province have been shelled intensively in recent weeks. 
Hundreds of thousands of Assad opponents have relocated to northwest Syria under evacuation agreements reached as other parts of the country fell to pro-government forces backed by Russia and Iran. Assad has indicated it could be his next target
The Observatory has said additional government forces have been arriving this week for a possible attack in area to the southwest of the opposition territory.
On Thursday the Syrian army dropped leaflets over opposition-held Idlib province, urging people to agree to a return of state rule and telling them the seven-year war was nearing its end. 
The Observatory said the air strikes were the first to hit the area in almost a month and could be seen as ""preparation for an offensive"". 
The United Nations worries that an offensive against the area could force 2.5 million people toward the Turkish border.
The Syrian White Helmets, a group of rescue workers established in rebel-held areas of the country, said air strikes, barrel bombs and shelling had hit the southern part of the opposition territory, causing damage, injuries and at least one death.
Pro-opposition television Orient News said 20 people were killed in west Aleppo province in strikes on the town of Urem al-Kubra.

1468,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 01:39PM ET</span>",U.N. says it has credible reports that China holds million Uighurs in secret camps,"By Stephanie Nebehay
GENEVA (Reuters) - A U.N. human rights panel said on Friday that it had received many credible reports that 1 million ethnic Uighurs in China are held in what resembles a ""massive internment camp that is shrouded in secrecy"". 
Gay McDougall, a member of the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, cited estimates that 2 million Uighurs and Muslim minorities were forced into ""political camps for indoctrination"" in the western Xinjiang autonomous region.
""We are deeply concerned at the many numerous and credible reports that we have received that in the name of combating religious extremism and maintaining social stability (China) has changed the Uighur autonomous region into something that resembles a massive internship camp that is shrouded in secrecy, a sort of 'no rights zone',"" she told the start of a two-day regular review of China's record, including Hong Kong and Macao.
China says Xinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists who plot attacks and stir up tensions between the mostly Muslim Uighur minority who call the region home and the ethnic Han Chinese majority.
A Chinese delegation of some 50 officials made no comment on her remarks at the Geneva session that continues on Monday. 
The allegations came from multiple sources, including activist group Chinese Human Rights Defenders, which said in a report last month that 21 percent of all arrests recorded in China in 2017 were in Xinjiang. 
Earlier, Yu Jianhua, China's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, said it was working towards equality and solidarity among all ethnic groups.
But McDougall said that members of the Uighur community and others Muslims were being treated as ""enemies of the state"" solely on the basis of their ethno-religious identity.
More than 100 Uighur students who returned to China from countries including Egypt and Turkey had been detained, with some dying in custody, she said. 
Fatima-Binta Dah, a panel member, referred to ""arbitrary and mass detention of almost 1 million Uighurs"" and asked the Chinese delegation: 
""What is the level of religious freedom available now to Uighurs in China, what legal protection exists for them to practice their religion?""
Panelists also raised reports of mistreatment of Tibetans in the autonomous region, including inadequate use of the Tibetan language in the classroom and at court proceedings.
""The U.N. body maintained its integrity, the government got a very clear message,"" Golok Jigme, a Tibetan monk and former prisoner living in exile, told Reuters at the meeting.

(Reuters) - Americans view Russia as a greater threat than Iran, Reuters/Ipsos opinion polls showed, as the Trump administration this week reintroduced sanctions on Tehran and slapped new ones on Moscow.
While a majority of U.S. adults view Iran as a threat to the United States, that number has decreased slightly over the past three years, the poll shows.
In comparison, the number of Americans who consider Russia a threat to their country increased since 2015, as U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election and on new accusations of Russian meddling ahead of the November midterm elections.
Highlights from Reuters/Ipsos polls show: 
Sixty-seven percent of U.S. adults said in a poll conducted in July 2018 that Iran poses a ""moderate,"" ""serious"" or ""imminent"" threat to the United States. That was down from 75 percent in March 2015, months before the Obama administration signed a nuclear deal lifting sanctions on Iran in return for curbs on its nuclear program. https://reut.rs/2KFBVd3
Seventy-one percent of Americans said in a similar poll taken in July 2018 that they viewed Russia as a threat to the United States, up from 67 percent in March 2015. https://reut.rs/2OXWTr7 
Seventy-three percent of U.S. adults said in a poll conducted in June 2018 that they have an unfavorable view of Iran, while 71 percent of Americans said in a similar poll conducted in the same time frame that they view Russia unfavorably. 
Thirty-four percent of registered voters said that the Republican Party has the better plan to handle Iran, and 28 percent said the Democratic Party had the better plan for Iran, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling from July 2018.
Trump withdrew the United States from the Iran nuclear deal in May 2018 and has taken a more isolationist approach to foreign policy than the previous administration.
According to Reuters/Ipsos polling, 39 percent of Americans said in July 30-August 5 poll that they approve of the way President Trump is handling foreign policy, including 78 percent of Republicans and 14 percent of Democrats.

GDANSK, Poland (Reuters) - A famous Gdansk statue of the sea god Neptune has become the latest Polish landmark to be dressed up in a T-shirt with the slogan 'Constitution', part of a stealth campaign by protesters who accuse the government of eroding the rule of law.
Locals and tourists in the northern Polish city were greeted on Friday morning by the strange sight of the trident-wielding deity in a fresh white T-shirt above his uncovered bronze legs.
Four other city landmarks, including statues of a Polish king and a group of World War Two heroes, received similar treatment overnight - the latest targets of activists who have struck across the country in the past two weeks.
The protesters are fighting a judicial overhaul by the ruling Law and Justice party that led to President Andrzej Duda's approval in July of a measure effectively letting the government choose the next Supreme Court chief.
The government says the changes are needed to make Polish courts more efficient and rid them of the vestiges of communism, but its critics say they undermine the independence of the courts. The reforms have sparked massive protests in Poland and put Warsaw on a collision course with the European Union. 
KOD, the group behind the T-shirt campaign and other protests, said the action was ""an attempt to draw the attention of broad public opinion to the fact that the president, despite many protests, signed a bill which changes the Supreme Court into a mock-up"". 
Elsewhere, the T-shirt activists have dressed up the Wawel Dragon statue in Krakow and the Floppy-Ear Teddy in Lodz, among many others.
In the eastern city of Biala Podlaska, two KOD members were charged with profanation after draping the T-shirt on a statue of the late Lech Kaczynski, Poland's former president who died in a plane crash in 2010 and whose twin brother Jaroslaw is the head of Law and Justice (PiS) and Poland's de facto leader.

""This is extremely ill-mannered and inappropriate. This shows the helplessness of the protesters who have no other idea how to attract attention,"" Tadeusz Cymanski, deputy head of the PiS parliamentary caucus, said of the T-shirt campaign.

YAOUNDE (Reuters) - Cameroon's government said on Friday it would investigate a video that Amnesty International said shows security forces shooting at least a dozen unarmed people in the Far North of the country where they are battling Islamist militants. 
Amnesty said in a statement it had verified the video through witness testimony, satellite imagery and analysis of the weapons, dialogue and uniforms. It said the video was shot in the village of Achigaya at an unknown date prior to May 2016.
The nearly four-minute video has circulated on social media in recent days. A government spokesman said it was released to undermine President Paul Biya ahead of an election in October.
At the start of the video, several men in military fatigues with automatic-style weapons joke among themselves, with one saying in French: ""This is a kamikaze mission."" 
The men then open fire for roughly 12 seconds on about a dozen people sitting or lying down against a wall and under guard.
After the firing stops, one of the armed men approaches the motionless bodies and fires several more times from point-blank range.
Around them, several buildings in the village are in flames and gunfire can be heard in the background. 
""Here is yet more credible evidence to support the allegations that Cameroon's armed forces have committed grave crimes against civilians,"" Ilaria Allegrozzi, Amnesty International’s Lake Chad Researcher, said.
Government spokesman Issa Tchiroma Bakary said that authorities would open an investigation into the video but said the government was the victim of a ""campaign of denigration"" ahead of the election, when Biya will try to extend his 36-year rule.
""We are in an electoral period and it's conducive to this kind of thing. People want to discredit the army and president,"" Tchiroma told Reuters. 
Cameroonian authorities have said they are also investigating a video that surfaced last month that appears to shows men in military uniform shooting dead two women and two children. 
But they have simultaneously dismissed that video as ""fake news"" meant to tarnish the government's image.
The Cameroonian army's elite Rapid Intervention Brigade (BIR) has been battling Nigerian militant group Boko Haram in the country's extreme north since late 2014.
Since then, the militants have killed hundreds of people in the Far North and their tactics have included the use of child suicide bombers to attack checkpoints, market places and mosques.
The group has killed tens of thousands of people in northern Nigeria since 2009 when it launched an insurgency to create an Islamic caliphate. At the peak of its strength in early 2015, it held territory around the size of Belgium before being weakened by a multi-national military coalition. 
Last year, Amnesty accused Cameroonian forces involved in the campaign of torturing suspected militants on a base used by American troops. Cameroon's government denied the accusations and the U.S. military said it had not received reports of abuse.

1472,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>",Peru's new president spurns opposition proposals on referendum,"By Mitra Taj
PUCALLPA, Peru (Reuters) - Peruvian President Martin Vizcarra has rejected calls to include measures proposed by opposition lawmakers in a national anti-corruption referendum that would bar them from serving consecutive terms in Congress.
His comments, in a Reuters interview on Thursday, underscore the increasingly prickly relationship between Vizcarra's less than five-month-old centrist government and the conservative opposition Popular Force party, which helped topple former President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski after graft and vote-buying allegations.
In addition to a ban on re-election to back-to-back terms in Congress, Vizcarra's proposed referendum would criminalize undeclared contributions to political campaigns, create a second chamber in Congress, and require 50 percent of aspiring senators on party lists to be women.
Those measures are at the heart of the legislation that Vizcarra personally delivered to Congress this week, which could upend politics as usual in the deeply impoverished Andean nation.
In the interview, before he donned indigenous garb and addressed a crowd in the sweltering Amazonian town of Pucallpa, Vizcarra said it was wrong for opposition lawmakers to try to add their own proposals to the already wide-ranging referendum.
""I think it's inappropriate,"" he said. The opposition's measures allow the death penalty in cases of child sex abuse and ban the government from buying ads in the private media.
""The current Congress has been in power for two years, why didn't they do it then,"" Vizacarra asked.
Opposition leaders could not be reached for immediate comment, but the dispute could set the stage for a fresh confrontation between the two branches of government just months after Kuczynski's resignation ended a period of prolonged political turmoil that shook markets.
Popular Force promised to let Vizcarra, Kuczynski's former vice president, govern through the rest of Kuczynski's scheduled term in 2021 when he took office in March. 
Tensions have risen, however, as Vizcarra has sought to distance himself from a political class widely seen as corrupt, following two years of intrigue surrounding Brazilian builder Odebrecht, which has admitted to paying $29 million in bribes to secure contracts in Peru.
Peru's four most recent presidents are now under investigation in connection with Odebrecht, as is the entire Popular Force party - led by twice defeated presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori, the daughter of former authoritarian leader Alberto Fujimori.
Trust in Peru's institutions has sunk to new lows in the past month on a fresh scandal involving influence-peddling allegations against judges, businessmen and lawmakers.
""OH, THIS IS SERIOUS""
Vizcarra's approval rating had also been slipping in opinion polls. But the most recent survey, by local pollster Datum, found support for Vizcarra surged 10 points to 49 percent after he first called for the referendum last month, according to local newspaper Peru21.
""People are saying, 'Oh, this is serious.' And it really is serious,"" Vizcarra said of his pledge to fight corruption.
""There's a lack of trust. People don't believe in their authorities anymore. One of my goals is to regain that trust,"" he said.
Without Congress' support, Vizcarra would have to collect hundreds of thousands of signatures to be able to call the referendum.
Vizcarra, who was cheered in Pucallpa as he spotlighted government plans for building a water treatment plant, has made a point of leaving the capital, Lima, to visit Peru's underdeveloped interior at least once a week.
He declined to detail his strategy if Congress does not back the proposed referendum but expressed optimism that it would eventually pass.
Vizcarra said he would support the opposition's efforts to hold a separate referendum on other topics next year but urged Congress to call a vote in this year's regional elections starting in October. ""They should let us move forward on that,"" he said.

In the interview, Vizcarra also discussed upcoming mining projects in Peru, the world's No. 2 copper producer.

Among the protesters who crossed Europe to take part were truck driver Daniel Ostafi, 42, who moved to Italy 15 years ago in search of a future he says Romania could not offer his family, and Mihai Podut, 27, a construction worker who left in 2014, first for France and later Germany.
They joined more than 7,000 protesters waving Romanian and European Union flags under a scorching sun, chanting ""Party of thieves"" and calling on the government to resign. More protesters were joining the rally as evening wore on and the day's heat subsided.
Some protesters scuffled briefly with riot police when they tried to break through a security line guarding the government building. Some threw bottles and other objects at police, who used tear gas. Several on both sides required brief medical attention.
An estimated 3 to 5 million Romanians are working and living abroad, the World Bank has said, or about a quarter of the European Union state's overall population. They sent home just under $5 billion last year, a lifeline for rural communities in one of the EU's least developed countries.
""I left to give my children a better life, which was not possible here then,"" said Ostafi.
""Unfortunately, it is still not possible, the ... people who govern us are not qualified and they are corrupt,"" he said, adding he hoped the next parliamentary election would see a bigger turnout.
Protests have occurred outside government headquarters regularly since the Social Democrats took power in early 2017 and tried to decriminalize several corruption offences.
Earlier this year, they pushed changes to the criminal codes through parliament that have raised concerns from the European Commission, the U.S. State Department and thousands of magistrates. The changes are pending Constitutional Court challenges.
Romania ranks as one of the EU's most corrupt states and Brussels keeps its justice system under special monitoring.
Several politicians from the ruling coalition derided the rally in the run up, saying they did not understand why the diaspora would protest.

""Almost all of the public sector is malfunctioning, it must be changed completely and replaced with capable people,"" said Podut. ""I would ask our ruling politicians to switch places with us, work the way we do and see what that is like.""

1474,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 12:29PM ET</span>",Two police officers among four fatally shot in Canada: authorities,"By Dan Culberson
FREDERICTON, New Brunswick (Reuters) - Four people, including two police officers, were killed in a shooting in eastern Canada on Friday in the latest eruption of gun violence across the country that has led to calls for weapons bans in cities.
Police said a suspect was taken into custody just three weeks after a gunman walked down a busy Toronto street, killing two people and wounding 13 others before taking his own life. 
Police in Fredericton, a city of about 56,000 that is the capital of the province of New Brunswick, said two of the dead were police officers but gave few details about the circumstances of the shooting and did not release names. They said the suspect was being treated for serious injuries.
Local media images showed emergency vehicles converging on a tree-lined residential street. Nearby facilities were closed and authorities imposed a lockdown for residents before issuing an all-clear message.
""It was scary,"" said Marlene Weaver, who was in bed on Friday morning when she heard shots ring out in her neighborhood. ""It takes you back to the shooting in Moncton.""
Three RCMP officers were killed and two more were wounded in 2014 in Moncton, New Brunswick, about 195 km (121 miles) from Fredericton, in one of the worst incidents of its kind in Canada.
Gun laws in Canada are stricter than in the United States but a proliferation of weapons has led to an increase in gun-related crimes in recent years.
Canadian Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) were assisting Fredericton authorities in the investigation.
New Brunswick had only three homicide shootings in 2016, according to Statistics Canada.
""Awful news coming out of Fredericton,"" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Twitter. ""My heart goes out to everyone affected by this morning’s shooting. We’re following the situation closely.""
""THIS MORNING I HEARD THOSE NOISES""
Jeff Magnussen, general manager of a golf course near the site of the shooting, said by phone he heard multiple gunshots before 8 a.m. local time.
""You hear a lot about gun violence in the United States,"" he said, ""but this morning when I heard those noises, what's starting to sink in is that those noises were people losing their lives. To have it happen so close to us is shocking. Now we're becoming the story that nobody wants to hear.""
In the wake of the Toronto bloodshed, the city council voted overwhelmingly to urge the federal government, which has jurisdiction over gun laws, to ban the sale of handguns in the city. 
""Why does anyone in this city need to have a gun at all?"" Toronto Mayor John Tory said. Canada's largest city has had 241 shooting incidents this year, resulting in 30 deaths, a 30 percent increase in fatalities.
Bill Blair, the government minister tasked with tackling gun violence, said officials are considering giving provinces the power to designate gun-free cities.
""It's possible that we could work with the provinces and territories and allow them the authority to designate certain municipalities as places where guns could not be purchased or possessed,"" Blair told Reuters.
In 2016 Canada had 0.61 firearm-related homicides per 100,000 people, a 23 percent increase from 2015 and the highest rate since 2005, according to Statistics Canada. For the United States, the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation reported 3.85 deaths per 100,000 that year.
Canada’s Liberal government unveiled proposals in March to tighten already tough gun control laws to address a spike in crimes involving firearms, including a deadly attack on a mosque last year.
The measures would enhanced background checks on people seeking to buy firearms, especially those with a history of violence.
Experts said that although Canada’s gun laws ban dozens of assault rifles, some permitted firearms can easily be modified for greater damage, and lax U.S. regulations make smuggled weapons accessible.

On Thursday, Ontario pledged more money for police and to keep suspects behind bars while they await trial on gun crime charges.

The investigation was launched last month following reports that as many as 14 civilians had been killed in an air strike supporting an operation by Afghan security forces in Chardara district, outside Kunduz city on July 19.
""After carefully considering all relevant and reasonably available information, which included a review of the Afghan government's report of findings, our investigation found no credible information to corroborate the allegations,"" U.S. Army Lt. Col. Martin O'Donnell, U.S. Forces-Afghanistan spokesman, said in a statement.
""U.S. Forces-Afghanistan takes all allegations of civilian casualties seriously. Should any further credible information become available, an investigative body will reconvene to re-review this allegation,"" the statement said.
Afghan government officials said last month that as many as 14 civilians had been killed but said that the causes of their deaths was unclear.
A statement from the U.S. military last month confirmed that U.S. forces had conducted strikes in support of Afghan-led ground operations but said that its on-the-ground assessment gave no indications that they had caused civilian casualties.
According to U.N. figures, civilian casualties from air strikes rose by 52 percent in the first half of the year following a sharp jump in the number of aerial operations launched under a U.S. strategy aimed at forcing the Taliban to accept peace negotiations.

BERKLEY HEIGHTS, New Jersey (Reuters) - The White House said on Friday the United States strongly condemned Russia's use of chemical weapons against a former Russian agent in Britain, two days after the U.S. State Department announced sanctions over the move.
""The attack against Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, United Kingdom, on March 4, 2018, was a reckless display of contempt for the universally held norm against chemical weapons,"" said a spokesman for the White House National Security Council in an email.
The spokesman said sanctions that the State Department said it would impose by the end of August fulfilled its legal obligations ""after determining a foreign government has used chemical or biological weapons against its own nationals or in violation of international law.""
Skripal, a former colonel in Russia's GRU military intelligence service, and his 33-year-old daughter were found slumped unconscious on a bench in the southern English city of Salisbury in March, after a liquid form of the Novichok type of nerve agent was applied to his home's front door.
President Donald Trump, who is spending the week at his golf property in New Jersey, did not comment on the recent sanctions when asked about them by a reporter on Thursday. Trump has sought to improve relations with Russia despite U.S. intelligence findings that Moscow had meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
European countries and the United States have expelled 100 Russian diplomats since that attack, in the toughest action by Trump against Russia since he came to office.

Trump and his advisers have often appeared at odds over how strongly to act against Moscow. In the run-up to a summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki last month, U.S. officials repeatedly called out Russia over its ""malign"" activities, but Trump did not use such language during a news conference with Putin.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's right-wing Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini has ordered the wording on some official forms changed so that same-sex couples cannot both declare themselves as a child's parents.
Salvini, interior minister and leader of the anti-immigrant League party, is now the Italy's most favored politician, according to some surveys, and his socially conservative policies have proven popular among voters so far.
In an interview with a Catholic online newspaper Salvini said he had ordered the identity card application forms for children to be changed to refer to the ""mother and father"" instead of ""parent 1"" and ""parent 2"".
""We will defend the natural family founded on the union between a man and a woman. I will exert all the power possible,"" Salvini told La Nuova Bussola Quotidiana.
In Italy surrogate pregnancies are illegal and same-sex couples cannot adopt children.
However, some courts and city halls have granted parental status to the partner of a mother or father who had children by a previous relationship, even though the right is not enshrined in national law.
Salvini said the government would never contemplate surrogate pregnancies ""or similar horrors"".
Support for the League, which governs with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, has surged from 17 percent of the vote at a March national election, to around 30 percent in recent opinion polls. The less hardline 5-Star, on the other hand, has held steady at about 30 percent.
Salvini's refusal to take in migrants rescued at sea by humanitarian ships has drawn criticism from some Roman Catholic factions because Pope Francis has made compassion toward refugees and migrants a plank of his papacy.
As a result, last month a popular Christian magazine comparing Salvini to Satan on its front cover.
But a recent Ipsos poll showed support for Salvini among Catholics who attend mass at least once a week has doubled, reaching almost 32 percent in July from just under 16 percent in March.
The previous center-left government passed a law granting limited rights to same sex couples in ""civil unions"" two years ago. After taking power in June, the League's minister for the family, Lorenzo Fontana, caused a stir when he said that as far as he was concerned ""rainbow families don't exist"".
Fontana, known for his conservative Catholic views, has also called for the repeal of the current law which punishes racial and religious discrimination.
On another issue, Salvini told the website he would try to crack down on shops selling legal cannabis products that have no psychoactive effects, which have become widespread in Italy. 
""These shops seem like Chinese massage centers that disguise fully-fledged brothels,"" he said. 

Salvini promised to find a compromise with the health minister, who is from 5-Star and who he said took a different view to him on the matter.

""Our legal team successfully filed our court papers. We have a good case and cause!!"" Chamisa tweeted.
Under the constitution, a losing presidential candidate has seven days to challenge the result from when a winner is declared. The Constitutional Court must rule within 14 days and Mnangagwa's inauguration would have to wait for the outcome of Chamisa's challenge.
Earlier this month, Mnangagwa secured a comfortable victory, according to results from the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission, polling 2.46 million votes against 2.15 million for the 40-year-old Chamisa. The opposition said the result was rigged.
The election, the first since the army's removal of 94-year-old ex-president Robert Mugabe last November, passed off relatively smoothly but its aftermath revealed the deep rifts in Zimbabwean society and the instinctive heavy-handedness of the security forces.

Two days after the vote, six people were killed in an army crackdown on protests against the victory by Mnangagwa's ruling ZANU-PF party, a reminder that Zimbabwe will struggle to repair its image as a nation known for repression and economic collapse.

Lewis Ludlow, 26, had planned to rent the vehicle and plow it into shoppers in the bustling retail district, which attracts large numbers of tourists, during the busiest time of the week, prosecutors said.
He had also considered attacking London's Madame Tussauds wax museum and St Paul's Cathedral. 
""Lewis Ludlow considers himself a soldier fighting for Daesh (Islamic State) in the UK,"" Deb Walsh from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said in a statement on Friday.
""To that end, he planned to drive a van into shoppers at Oxford Street hoping to kill over 100 people. He is a serious danger to the public and accepted his guilt when faced with the prosecution’s case against him.""
The CPS said Ludlow's mobile phone was found in the storm drain of his home in Rochester, southeast of London, which had photographs showing he had carried out hostile reconnaissance in central London. There was also a picture of a handwritten oath of allegiance to Islamic State (IS).
It also had videos in which Ludlow called himself ""the Eagle"", and spoke of his hatred of non-believers.
He was under 24-hour armed police surveillance when he was arrested and a number of torn-up notes which were found suggested Ludlow was actively involved in preparing an attack, with information about the cost of hotels near Oxford Street and renting a truck, prosecutors said.
He pleaded guilty at London's Old Bailey court to preparing to commit acts of terrorism as well as setting up Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Paypal accounts to fund IS fighters based in the Philippines. He will be sentenced on Nov. 2.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations General Assembly approved on Friday the appointment of former Chilean President Michelle Bachelet as the world body's new human rights chief.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres announced the appointment of Bachelet on Wednesday. She will replace Jordan's Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, who is stepping down at the end of the month after a four-year term in the Geneva-based job. 
Bachelet, who was tortured under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, was the first woman to be president of Chile, one of the region's most developed economies.
A former pediatrician, Bachelet first served as president from 2006 to 2010, and was popular for her government's welfare policies and steady economic growth during her tenure.
Bachelet then led U.N. Women, which supports gender equality and the empowerment of women, between 2010 and 2013. She returned to Chile and served again as president from 2014 to March this year, pushing for a more radical tax-and-spend agenda, as well as for gay marriage and abortion rights in the socially conservative country. 
Zeid told reporters in New York earlier this month that he did not seek a second term because he did not believe key world powers, including the United States, China and Russia, would support him.
Zeid has been strongly critical of some of U.S. President Donald Trump's policies and his attacks on the media. 
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said in a statement on Wednesday that the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights can have a ""strong voice"" on critical issues. 
""The U.N. has failed to adequately address major human rights crises in Iran, North Korea, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and elsewhere, or stop its chronic, disproportionate obsession with Israel. It is up to Ms. Bachelet to speak out against these failures rather than accept the status quo,"" Haley said. 

The United States withdrew in June from the Geneva-based U.N. Human Rights Council, which is separate from the High Commissioner for Human Rights office but works closely with it, over what it called chronic bias against Israel and a lack of reform.

Sentsov, 42, was arrested in Crimea after the Ukrainian territory was seized by Russian forces and annexed in 2014. He was jailed for 20 years on terrorism charges which he says are politically motivated, and has been on hunger strike since May to highlight Russia's human rights record.
""The President of the Republic conveyed to President Putin his concerns, given that the health of Mr Sentsov seems to have worsened dangerously, and the importance that Russia urgently finds a humanitarian solution to the situation,"" a statement from Macron's Elysee Palace said.
""President Putin committed to respond and to quickly publish information on Mr Sentsov's health,"" it said.
A statement published by the Kremlin after the conversation did not mention Sentsov, but Interfax later quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as confirming that the subject was discussed, without providing any more details.

The Kremlin had said on Thursday it had received a letter from the mother of Sentsov asking Putin to pardon her son. Sentsov's health is rapidly declining, his lawyer and a relative said.

PEMANANG, Indonesia (Reuters) - The death toll from a huge 6.9 magnitude earthquake in Indonesia’s Lombok island has climbed to more than 320, officials said on Friday, even as relief efforts picked up pace.
The national disaster mitigation agency said it had verified 321 deaths and that over 270,000 people had been forced to flee their homes because of a series of tremors over the past two weeks. 
On Thursday, the death toll from Sunday's quake jumped to 259.
A fresh 5.9 magnitude aftershock prompted fresh panic in the north of the popular holiday destination on Thursday.
Nearly 75 percent of residential structures have been destroyed in northern Lombok because of poor construction unable to withstand strong tremors, the agency said in a statement.
“Aid is being distributed as quickly as possible upon arrival,” Sutopo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency said in a statement, adding that hundreds of volunteers were assisting the efforts.
Mobile kitchens have started distributing much-needed food and water to thousands of evacuees in the worst-hit areas, he said, after several days’ delay due to poor access and communications.
President Joko Widodo on Friday said he was delaying plans to visit Lombok until next week, citing concerns over continuing aftershocks.
“After the emergency period is over, the government will undertake rehabilitation, reconstruction, repairs to residential areas and public facilities,” the cabinet secretariat website quoted Widodo as saying.
Widodo visited the island after a 6.4 magnitude quake on July 29 killed 17 people and injured dozens more.

The quakes have prompted tourists to flee during what is otherwise the peak season for the island destination famous for its beaches.

(Reuters) - Joan Fenton knows she will not make much money at her Charlottesville gift shop this weekend, when the downtown district will be virtually locked down for the anniversary of last year's deadly white nationalist rally. But like many other owners, she will be open anyway.
""They want to be open in solidarity with the community,"" Fenton said. ""They feel that not being here is giving in to fear and terror.""
Officials in Charlottesville have vowed a massive police presence – with some 1,000 personnel assigned – to deter any violence.
The ""Unite the Right"" rally last August, called to protest the removal of a Confederate statue, turned the picturesque Virginia college town into a chaotic scene of street brawls, and one woman was killed when an Ohio man rammed his car into a crowd of counterprotesters.
The organizer of last year's event, white nationalist Jason Kessler, was denied a permit in Charlottesville this year but has secured permission to hold a demonstration on Sunday in Washington, across the street from the White House.
Washington officials said on Thursday that police were ready for the rally as well as five planned counterprotests that could attract close to 2,000 people in all.
Officers will endeavor to keep the two sides separate, Metropolitan Police Chief Peter Newsham said. Guns will be prohibited from the demonstration area.
Larry Hogan, the Republican governor of neighboring Maryland, said on Friday that ""hate has no place in our society,"" and that he had directed state agencies to work with their counterparts in Washington and Virginia to ensure the safety of all citizens.
""As we face this invasion of vile and perverted ideology infesting our region, we stand united in our conviction that a diverse and inclusive Maryland is a stronger Maryland,"" he said.
UNPRECEDENTED LOCKDOWN 
Amid continuing controversy over President Donald Trump's views on race, the events will likely revive memories of his comments after Charlottesville when he said both sides were to blame for the violence. The remarks sparked criticism from across the political spectrum as the Republican president refused to condemn the white nationalists.
In Charlottesville, officials have announced an unprecedented lockdown of the bustling downtown district. Vehicles are prohibited, and pedestrians will be allowed in at only two checkpoints, where police will confiscate contraband.
Prohibited items include everything from metal pipes and swords to fireworks and skateboards.
Guns, however, can still be legally carried. After last year's violence, the city asked the state legislature to ban firearms from major public events, but the bill failed to advance.
It is not clear whether any white nationalists will come to Charlottesville this weekend, but officials said they were preparing for any contingency. Police were widely criticized after last year's event, where some officers did not intervene to stop fistfights and other mayhem.
Virginia's Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, pre-emptively declared a state of emergency on Wednesday, a procedural move that freed up additional resources.

Many business owners have said the plan is too restrictive and will cost them significant revenue on what would normally be a busy summer weekend. Merchants already suffered a downturn after last year's event; sales tax revenue dropped 11 percent in September 2017 compared with the year before, according to city figures.

1488,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 07:20AM ET</span>","Exclusive: As Trump cracks down on Pakistan, U.S. cuts military training programs","By Idrees Ali and Phil Stewart
ISLAMABAD/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration has quietly started cutting scores of Pakistani officers from coveted training and educational programs that have been a hallmark of bilateral military relations for more than a decade, U.S. officials say.
The move, which has not been previously reported, is one of the first known impacts from Trump's decision this year to suspend U.S. security assistance to Pakistan to compel it to crack down on Islamic militants.
The Pentagon and the Pakistani military did not comment directly on the decision or the internal deliberations, but officials from both countries privately criticized the move.
U.S. officials, speaking to Reuters on the condition of anonymity, said they were worried the decision could undermine a key trust-building measure. Pakistani officials warned it could push their military to further look to China or Russia for leadership training.
The effective suspension of Pakistan from the U.S. government's International Military Education and Training program (IMET) will close off places that had been set aside for 66 Pakistani officers this year, a State Department spokesperson told Reuters.
The places will either be unfilled or given to officers from other countries.
Dan Feldman, a former U.S. special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, called the move ""very short-sighted and myopic"".
""This will have lasting negative impacts limiting the bilateral relationship well into the future,"" Feldman told Reuters.
The State Department spokesperson, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the IMET cancellations were valued at $2.41 million so far. At least two other programs have also been affected, the spokesperson said. 
It is unclear precisely what level of military cooperation still continues outside the IMET program, beyond the top level contacts between U.S. and Pakistani military leaders.
The U.S. military has traditionally sought to shield such educational programs from political tensions, arguing that the ties built by bringing foreign military officers to the United States pay long-term dividends.
For example, the U.S. Army's War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, which would normally have two Pakistani military officers per year, boasts graduates including Lieutenant General Naveed Mukhtar, the current director-general of Pakistan's powerful spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence agency (ISI).
The War College, the U.S. Army's premier school for foreign officers, says it has hosted 37 participants from Pakistan over the past several decades. It will have no Pakistani students in the upcoming academic year, a spokeswoman said.
Pakistan has also been removed from programs at the U.S. Naval War College, Naval Staff College and courses including cyber security studies.
    
""LIES AND DECEIT""
In his first tweet of 2018, Trump slammed Pakistan, saying the country has rewarded past U.S. aid with ""nothing but lies & deceit."" Washington announced plans in January to suspend up to roughly $2 billion in U.S. security assistance to Pakistan.
But weeks later, Pakistan's foreign secretary was quoted by local media saying that Islamabad had been told the United States would continue funding IMET programs. 
Officially allies in fighting terrorism, Pakistan and the United States have a complicated relationship, bound by Washington's dependence on Pakistan to supply its troops in Afghanistan but plagued by accusations Islamabad is playing a double game.
Tensions have grown over U.S. complaints that the Afghan Taliban militants and the Haqqani network that target American troops in Afghanistan are allowed to shelter on Pakistani soil. 
Current and former U.S. officials said Defense Secretary Jim Mattis argued against excluding Pakistani officers from IMET courses. 
""I am shocked... We worked so hard for this to be the one thing that got saved,"" said a former U.S. defense official, who was involved in the conversations.
The Pentagon declined to comment on internal government discussions, but Dana White, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said Mattis long believed in the value of the IMET program as a way to build relations between foreign militaries.
Pakistani Senator Mushahid Hussain, chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, told Reuters that a U.S. decision to cut off such exchanges would be counter-productive and push Pakistan's military towards other countries.
""It is one of those silly, punitive measures that they have deployed,"" said Hussain, who sat next to a Chinese and Pakistani flag in his office.
Russia and Pakistan signed an agreement earlier this week that would allow for Pakistani military officers to train at Russian institutes. 
Pakistan's military has ruled the country for about half of its history and traditionally seen the country's foreign policy in its domain. 
IMET courses have been able to withstand poor relations between the two countries in the past, even after al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed in a U.S. Navy SEAL raid in the Pakistani town of Abbotabad in 2011. 
A NATO helicopter raid killed 28 Pakistani troops later that year in a friendly fire incident on the Afghan-Pakistan border. 
Feldman said that after the raid, when relations were at a low point, the United States limited large security assistance items, but made active efforts to continue the IMET program.
    
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE
In the 1990's former U.S. President George H.W. Bush refused to certify that Pakistan did not have nuclear weapons, triggering the so-called ""Pressler Amendment"" that required cutting off all military assistance. That included IMET courses.
""The unintended consequence was we didn't know a decade of the Pakistani military leadership as well, and therefore couldn't engage as effectively with them when we needed to,"" Feldman said. 
Mattis, in private discussions within the government, had warned that excluding Pakistani officers from IMET courses could contribute to a similar situation in years to come, the former U.S. defense official said.
Pakistan had been the largest recipient of IMET between 2003 and 2017, according to the Security Assistance Monitor which tracks U.S. assistance. 

""You can advocate for cutting off everything else and this was the one thing we were not supposed to touch,"" the former official said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Maldives wants India to withdraw military helicopters and personnel posted there following the expiry of an agreement in June, its envoy said, the latest snub to New Delhi by President Abdulla Yameen's China-backed government. 
India and China are going head to head in the Maldives, the Indian Ocean island chain where Beijing is building roads, bridges and a bigger airport, upstaging India which has been the country's prime provider of military and civilian aid for decades. 
India has opposed Yameen's crackdown on political rivals and the imposition of an emergency this year and some of the president's rivals have called on New Delhi for military intervention, creating worries in the Maldivian government.
The tensions are impacting aid programs such as security assistance that New Delhi has given to smaller countries in the region to help them protect exclusive economic zones, carry out surveys and combat piracy. 
The Maldives' ambassador in India, Ahmed Mohamed, told Reuters that two military helicopters provided by India were mainly used for medical evacuations but were no longer required as the islands had built up enough resources of its own.
""They were very useful in the past but with the development of adequate infrastructure, facilities and resources we are now in a position to handle medical evacuations on our own,"" he said.
However, India and the Maldives are still conducting joint patrols in the islands' exclusive economic zone every month, Mohamed said. The Maldives, 400 km (250 miles) to the southwest of India, is close to the world's busiest shipping lanes, between China and the Middle East. 
Along with the helicopters, India had stationed around 50 military personnel, including pilots and maintenance crew, and their visas had expired. But New Delhi has not yet withdrawn them from the island chain.
""We are still there, our two helicopters and the men,"" an Indian navy spokesman said on Wednesday, adding the foreign ministry was handling the situation. The foreign ministry did not respond to a Reuters' request for comment.
""IT'S THE PERSONNEL""
India has been demanding that Yameen free political rivals including former President Abdul Gayoom and Supreme Court justices. It also criticized Yameen's decision to hold elections in September saying the rule of law should be restored before embarking on such an exercise.
India was a close supporter of Gayoom during his long years of stewardship of the island chain and sent troops to foil an attempted coup against him in 1988. 
China, which opened an embassy in the Maldives in 2011, has rapidly built ties with the tropical island chain as part of its Belt and Road Initiative. It says it is opposed to any country interfering in the internal affairs of the Maldives.
Providing helicopters and patrol boats and satellite assistance to countries such as the Maldives, Mauritius and the Seychelles has been part of India's naval diplomacy to retain influence in the Indian Ocean. 
But in recent years China has moved in, building ports and roads backed by loans. In the Maldives, Beijing Urban Construction Group Company Limited took over a project to expand the airport servicing the capital Male, after the government canceled a $511 million deal with India's GMR Infrastructure.
Maldives has also given the Chinese a few islands to develop, officials said. Abhijit Singh, a former Indian naval officer who specializes on Indian Ocean politics at the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation, said the Indian helicopters were deployed near the islands where the Chinese were present. 
""Now the issue is Yameen wants the helicopters out, but more importantly he wants the personnel out. It is not the helicopters that trouble him so much, it is actually the fact that there are these people there.""
""Yameen has invited China to do a lot of infrastructure building and he suspects that India is trying to keep a watch on what the Chinese are doing and so wants to keep the Indians out,"" said Singh.

Ambassador Ahmed declined comment on that view.

GENEVA (Reuters) - A heat wave in North Korea has led to rice, maize and other crops withering in the fields, ""with potentially catastrophic effects"", the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said on Friday.
The world's largest disaster relief network warned of a risk of a ""full-blown food security crisis"" in the isolated country, where a famine in the mid-1990s killed up to three million people. It said the worrying situation had been exacerbated by international sanctions imposed due to North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.
In a statement issued in Geneva, the IFRC said there had been no rainfall since early July as temperatures soared to an average 39 Celsius (102 Fahrenheit) across the country, whose official name is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). The next rain was expected in mid-August.
The population of 25 million is already stressed and vulnerable with malnutrition among children that could worsen, stunting their growth, it said. 
""This is not yet classified as a drought, but rice, maize and other crops are already withering in the fields, with potentially catastrophic effects for the people of DPRK,"" said Joseph Muyamboit, the IFRC's program manager in Pyongyang.
""We cannot and must not let this situation become a full-blown food security crisis. We know that previous serious dry spells have disrupted the food supply to a point where it has caused serious health problems and malnutrition across the country.""
North Korea called last week for an ""all-out battle"" against the record temperatures threatening crops, referring to an ""unprecedented natural disaster"".
Drought and floods have long been a seasonal threat in North Korea, which lacks irrigation systems and other infrastructure to ward off natural disasters.
In Seoul, South Korea’s Unification Ministry said it had no specific information on the situation in the north, but that the Red Cross had notified them of the heat wave last week.
The IFRC was helping the national Red Cross to support 13,700 of the most vulnerable people at risk, in South Hamgyong and South Pyongan provinces. It had deployed emergency response teams and 20 water pumps to irrigate fields in the hardest-hit areas, it said.
David Beasley, the head of the U.N.'s World Food Programme (WFP), visited North Korea in May to look into boosting food distributions to hungry women and children, in the latest sign of an opening.

About 70 percent of North Koreans are ""food insecure"", meaning they struggle to avoid hunger, and one in four children under five is stunted from chronic malnutrition, the WFP said at the time. A 2015 drought worsened the situation, it said.

1491,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 06:40AM ET</span>","Russia must rein in torture, prosecute prison guards: U.N.","By Stephanie Nebehay
GENEVA (Reuters) - Russia must halt frequent torture of detainees and prosecute perpetrators, including prison guards caught on video beating an inmate that led to a public outcry, United Nations human rights investigators said on Friday.
The U.N. Committee against Torture, in a rare move, told Russian authorities to report back in a year on the emblematic case of guards beating Yevgeny Makarov with truncheons and on harassment of activists and journalists.
The Novaya Gazeta newspaper published the 10-minute clip last month and said the incident took place in June 2017 in a prison in the city of Yaroslavl, northeast of Moscow.
The panel voiced concern that in this case, ""video surveillance proved to be ineffective in preventing acts of torture, that the video recording was suppressed by the officials for almost one year and that investigation was undertaken only after the video recording was leaked to media and attracted wide attention"". 
Russian deputy justice minister Mikhail Galperin, who led a delegation at a two-day examination of its record, said that authorities would prosecute the guards. This would become a ""very clear signal on the unacceptability of torture"".
Seventeen officials have been removed from their jobs in connection with the case, including five who have been arrested, while a sixth arrest is under consideration, he said.
The U.N. panel, composed of 10 independent experts, called on Russian authorities to protect Makarov, and his lawyer Irina Biryukova who has fled the country, against reprisals.
Russia must ""combat impunity concerning torture and ill-treatment cases, including by ensuring that high-level government officials publicly and unambiguously affirm that torture will not be tolerated,"" it said in its conclusions.
The experts had received ""consistent and numerous reports indicating the lack of prompt, impartial and effective investigation into allegations of torture or ill-treatment"".
Some 600,000 people are held in nearly 1,000 prisons and detention centers across Russia, with 4,000 deaths from various causes recorded each year, ""one of the highest rates in the Council of Europe countries"", panel chairman Jens Modvig said during the review.
In its conclusions, the panel called on authorities to reduce the number of deaths in custody, including by suicide, and to investigate all deaths through independent forensic examinations. 
Russian authorities must stop putting people involuntarily in psychiatric institutions, particularly in the annexed territory of Crimea, and halt torture of political opponents to obtain confessions, including jailed Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov who is on a hunger strike, it said.

1492,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 06:31AM ET</span>","Overworked, underpaid: Bangladesh bus drivers say accidents not entirely their fault","By Serajul Quadir and Ruma Paul
DHAKA (Reuters) - Khurshid Alam says he pulls 17-hour shifts three days a week driving a private bus in Dhaka, where tens of thousands of students held angry protests for over a week demanding an end to rash driving that killed two teenagers late last month.
Prime Minister Sheik Hasina's government has moved swiftly to defuse the protests that were threatening to spiral, with an eye on general elections due by the end of the year. On Monday, the cabinet approved raising the maximum jail time for rash driving deaths to five years from three.
Overworked and underpaid drivers like Alam are often blamed for Bangladesh's high traffic casualty rate - road accidents kill or injure at least five people an hour in the country - and the resentment against them has been aggravated by the deaths of the two students last Friday. 
Most bus drivers do not get paid monthly salaries but earn commissions based on the number of passengers picked, leading them to race each other for passengers. 
The two students were killed when the driver of a bus speeding to pick up passengers ahead of other buses in a congested part of Dhaka lost control and plowed into the bus stop, a court heard this week.
The crowded capital of 18 million has been paralyzed by angry students since then, although the protests have now tapered off. Police have fired tear gas and used water cannon to disperse protesters, as students, many in their school uniforms, stopped vehicles, demanding to check drivers' licenses and their vehicles' roadworthiness.
""I start driving at 6 am and continue up to 11 pm,"" said a bearded Alam, 45, as he got ready for a trip on his green and ash bus with a cracked windshield, in a city teeming with scuffed up buses and beaten-up, used cars.
Alam said he had reported the cracked windshield to the bus owner, but it was yet to be replaced.
He said he works for three days a week, making up to 1,200 taka ($14) a day. A bus driver on contract with the Delhi Transport Corporation in neighboring India earns as much as three times that.
""If we get a monthly salary then we can drive without any tension. We always have to keep thinking about our earnings,"" Alam said.
As he stepped on the accelerator, a cycle-rickshaw with two passengers suddenly appeared in front of the bus, forcing him to hard-brake.
SAFETY COSTS
""We are working to bring discipline in the streets,"" said Khondaker Enayet Ullah, secretary general of the Bangladesh Road Transport Owners Association.
""It's true that shortage of drivers often compels us to hire unskilled drivers. But we are asking the transport owners not to appoint anyone without proper licenses from now on.""
About 4,000 people were killed in driving deaths in Bangladesh in 2017 and 2,350 in the first seven months of this year, according to data compiled by the Accident Research Institute at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology.
Many protesters have demanded the government tighten transport regulations, including by setting limits on the hours worked by drivers and providing a minimum monthly salary.
But Abul Qasem, who owns the Tusher Transport Company in Dhaka that has 10 buses, said implementing those suggestions would mean higher fares that customers in the price-sensitive country would not readily agree to.
""If the government asks us to fix eight hours duty a day, we will follow it. In that case, fares will increase because then there will be at least two shifts a day,"" said Qasem. ""That will anger passengers. Will the government then subsidize us?""
The drivers say they also want the government to install more traffic lights and build dedicated lanes for pedestrians, instead of putting all the blame on drivers.
""Everybody has a guardian to take care of their interests but we don't,"" said bus driver Alam.

Federal politicians in Australia, a constitutional monarchy whose head of state is the British monarch, are not obliged to hand out the pictures, but can claim an allowance to provide them, as well as items such as flags, at constituents' request.
The allowance has existed since 1990, but was little known or drawn on until reported by Vice News on Wednesday.
""I can say before the story was published, I had received zero requests for portraits of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth,"" Tim Watts, an opposition Labor Party politician representing parts of Melbourne told Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio.
About four dozen requests arrived in the last 24 hours, he said, adding, ""I think 99 percent were tongue firmly in cheek."" 
A national vote in 1999 defeated a motion that Australia should drop the monarchy to become a republic.
Though support for the move has hovered around 50 percent in opinion polls since, there is little appetite to put the issue back on the agenda, at least during Queen Elizabeth's reign.

Her popularity is secure in Australia, where people line streets during royal visits and thousands watched Prince Harry's May wedding to Meghan Markle on television.

China's $1.3 billon-worth of donations and concessionary loans since 2011 trails Australia's $6.6 billion, figures compiled by Australia's Lowy Institute show, but it is more than New Zealand's $1.2 billion.
Spending by China, criticized by many of its neighbors for island building in the South China Sea, is almost 9 percent of total aid donations in the South Pacific. If pledged aid is included, China's promises total $5.9 billion, or nearly a third of all aid pledged to the region's 14 countries by 62 donors.
""As a developing country, China fully understands the special difficulty Pacific island countries face in achieving sustainable development,"" the ministry said in a statement sent to Reuters.
China ""provides what aid it can on the basis of respecting the wishes of the island nations without attaching any political conditions, vigorously promoting socio-economic development"", it added.
""China's aid is aimed at promoting the well-being of the people of the island nations, and strengthening their ability to develop sustainably, without seeking any personal gain, and it is also not aimed at any third party,"" the ministry said.
The Lowy numbers, which do not include New Zealand contributions since March 2017, also show China jostling with Taiwan to use aid money as a means of cultivating diplomatic ties in region home to a third of Taiwan's allies.
China considers self-ruled and democratic Taiwan to be merely a wayward province, with no right to diplomatic relations.
China ""hopes the relevant side abandons 'zero sum thinking' and unprovoked suspicion, and does more to benefit peace, stability and development for Pacific island nations"", the ministry added, without elaborating.
Australia and the United States have begun a new campaign to counter China's rising influence in the Pacific.

Australia on Thursday promised radio gear and help to build parliament offices in Samoa's capital of Apia, the latest pledge of aid in the Pacific Islands where China and Australia have been ramping up tit-for-tat donations.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Hundreds of firefighters were building barriers and constructing containment lines early on Friday to slow an approaching wildfire threatening to torch thousands of homes in a lakeside community southeast of Los Angeles. 
More than 21,000 people have been evacuated in and around Lake Elsinore where furious flames and billowing smoke rose into the sky at the edge of the city of 60,000 as the blaze, dubbed the Holy Fire, burned nearby in the Santa Ana Mountains. 
""It feels like a war zone,"" Ana Tran told the Los Angeles Times as ash and flame retardant fell on her neighborhood. 
The fire, which was five percent contained, was being fueled by dry brush covering steep terrain and stoked by erratic wind gusts during the night, said Thanh Nguyen, a spokesman for the incident said. 
""Strong down drafts is making the fire move aggressively downhill,"" said Nguyen, noting that firefighters were working to build barriers and containment lines to protect more than 2,000 homes at risk from the fire.
Three firefighters suffered minor injuries battling the relatively small blaze that consumed more than 10,200 acres (4,128 hectares) since it began on Tuesday, fire officials said. 
Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency for the area on Thursday, freeing up additional resources to battle the blaze. Forrest Clark, 51, was charged with setting the fire, the Orange County District Attorney Office said.
The Holy Fire was one of several fires burning in California that have displaced tens of thousands of people. Wildfires across the state and region could be further stoked by strong gusts, low humidity and hot weather on Friday and Saturday, forecasters warned. 
In Northern California, a mechanic helping to fight the Carr Fire burning around Redding was killed in a traffic collision on Thursday, bringing the death toll from that blaze to eight, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire) said. The 178,000-acre Carr Fire has killed two other firefighters along with three members of one family and has destroyed nearly 1,100 homes. It was 49 percent contained with firefighters struggling in steep terrain to control the blaze, CalFire said.
More than 4,000 firefighters are battling the Mendocino Complex Fire, which has burned 305,200 acres in three counties north of San Francisco, CalFire said. 

Two firefighters were injured and 119 homes destroyed by that fire which now ranks as the largest fire on record in the state.

U.S. attack helicopters and drone aircraft provided government forces with air support. But as smoke rose across the city and witnesses reported bodies lying in the streets, and it was unclear how much of Ghazni was under government control.
The attack on a strategic city straddling the main route between the capital Kabul and southern Afghanistan demonstrated the Taliban's strength, underscoring how volatile the security situation remains less than three months before parliamentary elections in October.
The defense ministry in Kabul said the attackers had been driven off but were still present in one area of the city and had occupied civilian houses, from where they were still keeping up occasional fire on security forces clearing the area.
It said around 150 attackers had been killed or wounded but gave no estimate of casualties for civilians or security forces.
A statement from U.S. military headquarters in Kabul said fighting had ceased by 8.00 a.m. (0330 GMT) and Afghan forces had held their ground and maintained control of all government centers.
""U.S. forces responded with close-air support (U.S. attack helicopters) and conducted one strike (drone). In addition, U.S. aircraft conducted a show of presence,"" Lt Col. Martin O'Donnell, spokesman for U.S. Forces-Afghanistan said in an emailed statement.
Officials said clashes between security forces and the Taliban started at around 2.00 a.m., forcing the closure of the main highway linking Ghazni to the capital Kabul, 150 kilometers (95 miles) to the northeast.
""The Taliban are dropping missiles near residential and commercial areas. There has not been a single minute of silence for the last eight hours,"" said a senior government official in Ghazni early on Friday.
Ghazni police chief General Farid Ahmad Mashal said the Taliban seized several parts of the city, which has been under threat for months with heavy fighting in surrounding districts.
As helicopters circled overhead in the early morning, a second government official said it was too dangerous for people to leave their homes and he had no immediate details on casualties.
""It is not possible to get out of our homes to help the injured or collect bodies,"" he said.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid issued a statement saying multiple attacks were launched overnight in Ghazni. Dozens of Afghan soldiers and police had been killed and large quantities of weapons and equipment had been seized, he said.
However, O'Donnell said initial reports indicated minimal casualties among Afghan security forces.
""This is yet another failed Taliban attempt to seize terrain, which will result in yet another eye-catching, but strategically inconsequential headline,"" he said.
The attack came amid growing hopes of talks to end 17 years of war in Afghanistan and less than two weeks before the Eid al-Adha festival, when the Western-backed government in Kabul had been considering offering a ceasefire.
In June, a three-day truce over the Eid al-Fitr holiday brought unprecedented scenes of unarmed Taliban fighters mingling with security forces in Kabul and other cities, offering a glimpse of peace and fuelling hopes of negotiations to end the war.
The Taliban have so far failed to take and hold any provincial center since they overran the northern city of Kunduz in 2015 before being driven off with the support of U.S. air strikes and Special Forces units.
They came close to repeating the feat in 2016, and in May this year they nearly overran the western city of Farah before being beaten back with the aid of U.S. forces.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, brandished his nationalist and religious credentials on Friday amid reports he had come under pressure from Islamic party allies to accept a conservative cleric as running mate in next year's election.
In a last-minute decision, Widodo announced on Thursday Ma'ruf Amin, who heads the board of advisers of the country's biggest mass Muslim organization, Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), would be his vice presidential candidate for April's poll.
The duo will be challenged by the former general Prabowo Subianto and the private equity tycoon and Jakarta deputy governor Sandiaga Uno. 
Wearing a crisp white shirt emblazoned with the slogan ""Clean. With the people. Real work."", Widodo told supporters on Friday he would ""safeguard national resources"".
He cited as evidence recent policy decisions to nationalize oil and gas assets and seize majority ownership of the huge Grasberg gold and copper mine from the U.S. based Freeport-McMoran.
""It is proof that we are sovereign,"" he said.
Amin later led the crowd in prayer, asking God to ""give us the capability and spirit to safeguard us against forces that try to destroy, to weaken us and our country.""
The pair left the stage as Islamic singing, rendered in Arabic, played.
The cleric then delivered a sermon at Friday prayers at Jakarta's biggest mosque.
Prabowo and Uno were to have gone to the mosque before formally registering as candidates at the election commission but changed their plans and prayed at a nearby mosque instead.
'STAUNCH CONSERVATIVE'
Amin also heads the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI), an influential group for clerics that has issued fatwas hostile to minorities, including the Islamic sect Ahmadiyah and the gay community.
He also issued a statement accusing former Jakarta governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama of blasphemy for insulting the Koran, an edict that led hundreds of thousands of protesters to swarm the streets of the Indonesian capital demanding his ouster last year.
Purnama, an ethnic Chinese Christian, lost the election as he divided his time between campaigning and defending himself against blasphemy charges in court. He was later jailed for two years. 
Kevin O'Rourke, a political analyst, said Amin was a ""staunch conservative"" and ""adroit manipulator"".
""As VP, he can bolster Islamic groups and perhaps give some other religious conservative a chance to succeed Widodo,"" he wrote. 
Indonesia politics analyst Marcus Mietzner said Amin's appointment could neuter attacks on Widodo's alleged lack of religious conviction and elevate nationalist themes in the election campaign.
""(The opposition) are probably going to shift their focus onto ultra-nationalist themes: sell-out to China, invasion of foreign workers, evil imports, predatory investors,"" he told Reuters in emailed comments.
""These are classic Prabowo themes anyway, but they will become even more pronounced this time.""
Widodo and Prabowo contested the last presidential election in 2014. Widodo won but his popularity slumped mid-campaign after false reports were spread online that he was a Christian and an ethnic Chinese descendent.
After Friday prayers, Prabowo declared himself the candidate for the poor, touching on another central theme of his campaign: inequality.
""Our job as leaders is to eliminate people's suffering so that nobody is hungry, naked or suffering ... no matter what their religion is.""
""Our friends here are sometimes considered radicals, but believe me, there is no radical Islam in Indonesia,"" added Prabowo, who has forged close ties with hardline Islamists.
'DEPENDENT'
According to party officials from the president's coalition, Widodo had favored an alternative to Amin, former constitutional court chief justice Mahfud MD. 
In a television interview, Mahfud said he was asked ""in some detail"" to prepare to be the running mate and was on standby to be anointed on Thursday.
Mahfud said it was Widodo's decision to overlook him.
But, as quoted by the news portal Detik.com, NU board member Robikin Emhas said NU leaders, including Amin, told Widodo that they could not support Mahfud.
Mietzner said Widodo had initially discounted NU's opposition to Mahfud.
""The implications are that four years into his presidency, Jokowi is still much more dependent on his supporting parties than he cares to admit. (It's) a demonstration of his continued weakness,"" he said, referring to Widodo by his nickname.
A presidential spokesman was not immediately available for comment.
A leader of NU-aligned National Awakening Party (PKB), Muhaimin Iskander, told reporters on Thursday it was a surprise Amin was selected and that Mahfud was Widodo's initial preference.
""I thought Mahfud was chosen. But it turned out to be Ma'ruf Amin,"" he said.

But the ceasefire will face its first test later in the day, as Palestinians in Gaza planned on resuming weekly border protests, which at times have become violent.
After a quiet night, Israel's military told residents in the south, who had spent much of the past two days in rocket shelters, they could return to their daily routines.
A rise in cross-border rockets and air strikes in recent weeks has prompted the United Nations and Egypt to try to broker a truce to prevent another all-out conflict.
Since the escalation on Wednesday, Palestinian militants fired scores of rockets including a long-range missile deep into Israel and Israeli aircraft struck more than 150 targets in Gaza.
A pregnant Palestinian woman and her 18-month-old child were killed in the Israeli attacks, as was a Hamas militant. Seven people were wounded by Palestinian rockets and mortars that struck Israel.
Palestinian officials said a truce had been reached with Egyptian mediation. There was no formal comment from Israel, which rarely acknowledges reaching any such agreement with Hamas.
Hamas, an Islamist group designated by most Western countries as a terrorist organization, has fought three wars with Israel in the past decade.
With the ceasefire holding, organizers of border protests against Israel drove through streets of Gaza with loudspeakers, calling for a massive attendance.
Gazans have held weekly protests since March 30, some of which have become violent, to demand the right of return for Palestinian refugees. The Israeli army has killed at least 158 Palestinians during those protests, and a Gaza sniper killed an Israeli soldier.

Egypt and the United Nations have been trying to mediate a comprehensive cease-fire to prevent an escalation in fighting and to ease the deep economic hardship in Gaza, a narrow strip of land that is home to two million Palestinians.

MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippine justice minister has ordered a review of a lease agreement for a $1.5 billion casino project by Landing International Development after President Rodrigo Duterte abruptly halted it, saying it was unfavorable to the government.
Just as Hong Kong's Landing broke ground on Tuesday on the integrated casino-resort at Manila's Entertainment City, Duterte sacked the board of the Nayong Pilipino Foundation which administers the land and who had agreed the terms of Landing's lease, which tied the government to a lengthy contract that collected rent at far below market value.
Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra said the deal between state-owned Nayong Pilipino and Landing would be investigated, but stressed that it did not mean the project was dead.
""The removal of all the members of the Nayong Pilipino board, by itself alone, does not affect the implementation of the project,"" he told reporters on Thursday.
However, he said it could be affected by the re-evaluation of the deal and the appointment of a new Nayong Pilipino board. 
Landing said on Tuesday the casino would go ahead and its lease contract remained valid, unless nullified by a court. Landing said on Friday that it had no further comment. 
The review is the latest setback for a gaming sector whose fast growth has until recently been warmly welcomed by the Philippines. It now finds itself increasingly at the mercy of a powerful president who dislikes gambling, even though it attracts tourists, creates jobs and brings in revenue. 
Earlier this year Duterte halted the licensing of new integrated resorts to prevent overcrowding. On Wednesday he reiterated that he hated gambling and would not allow new casinos to set up beyond those already approved.
The national gaming regulator said on Friday it would stick by industry policies on licensing and leases but would respect any order issued by the president.
A distant relative of the president who was a member of the Nayong Pilipino board Duterte sacked identified herself on Friday as the whistle-blower who reported the irregularities with the lease, which she said would see rent collected at more than two-thirds below the market value.
""There was no bidding, it did not undergo proper process. They (board members) did not publicize or put it to challenge of other investors for comparison,"" Maria Fema Duterte, who married into the Duterte family, told news channel ANC. 

Former Nayong Pilipino officials could not be for comment. Former chairman Patricia Ocampo said on Tuesday said the contract was ""above-board"" and ""highly advantageous to the government and to the Filipino people"".

1501,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 04:03AM ET</span>",Say what? Language hurdles plague two Koreas after years of division,"By Jeongmin Kim and Josh Smith
SEOUL (Reuters) - When South Korean businessman Kim Yong-tae worked with North Koreans at the Kaesong Industrial Complex before it was closed in 2016, one of the biggest challenges was communicating in what is ostensibly a shared language.
""There were confounding moments because there were terms I never heard of while working and living just in South Korea,"" he said, describing blank looks from some North Korean workers when he used the word ""container,"" which is pronounced similar to its English term in South Korea.
Between the South's increasing adoption of international terms and the North's political sensitivity to some words, the growing language divide is complicating cooperation on a range of joint cultural and economic exchanges as ties between the neighbors improve.
To counter the confusion and promote a feeling of unity, the South Korean government is working to restart an obscure academic project aimed at developing a common Korean language dictionary with the North. 
North and South Korea speak the same language based on the Hangeul alphabet, but after decades of division, only about 70 percent of words are mutually understood, according to some experts.
GROWING APART
The two Koreas officially maintain the goal of reunification, but as each side has developed in strikingly different ways, that dream has faded.
North Korea's government has maintained - at least officially - a tight grip on its economy, meaning many North Koreans are unfamiliar with some economic and business terms common in the South's more capitalist system.
""Homelessness, yearly rent, monthly rent: The North Koreans have no such terms since everything is owned by the state which gives out housing,"" said Kim Wanseo, a South Korean lexicographer on the committee working to compile the dictionary.
After she defected to the South in 2002, Kim Young-hee said she had to learn a number of financial terms that didn't exist in the North, including the words for stocks and shares.
""When it comes to general terms, I would say seven out of 10 words can be mutually understood by people from each side,"" said Kim, the lexicographer. ""However, when it comes to jargon and technical words there is a big, big difference between the two now.""
The North's cultural and political isolation has also meant North Koreans have adopted fewer English words.
This became obvious when the players from North and South Korea combined for a joint ice hockey team during the Olympics.
""The only two words we shared were 'skates' and 'puck',"" said Kim Jung-min, spokesman for the Korea Ice Hockey Association. ""We had to coordinate before all training started, and we printed out the list of different terms between the two and stuck them on the athletes’ lockers.""

COMPILING A DICTIONARY
In the wake of April’s summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, the two counties have embarked on a number of cooperation projects designed to avoid running afoul of sanctions.
Besides the dictionary, began in 2006 but halted in 2015 due to political tensions, projects being discussed include the archaeological excavation of a palace in North Korea, performances by a North Korean art troupe in South Korea, pest control projects in the North, and a number of sporting events. 
And in a gesture of unity, North Korea changed its time zone by half an hour to realign with the South.
The South's Unification Ministry says preserving and unifying the language is needed to prepare for eventual unification.
Politics is never far away, however, and past dictionary discussions with the North Koreans often involved sensitive terms.
For example, the dictionary's authors had to avoid one term for ""him,"" which was typically used only to apply to North Korean leaders, and the United States could not be mentioned in examples, said Kim, the lexicographer.
The sides debated the definition of the word ""dong-mu,"" which means childhood friend in the South, but has come to mean comrades who experienced the communist revolution together in the North.
""We had to negotiate what an impartial definition is – and ended up defining it as ‘someone who strives together for a single goal,’ Kim said.
Other debates were less serious.
In South Korea, the verb ""sal-ji-da"" is used to say ""hey, you’ve gained some weight."" 

""It’s insulting in some contexts here too, but it’s a very insulting word to the North Koreans - to a whole new level,"" Kim said. ""They only use this verb for farm animals.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe looks well placed to win a September ruling party leadership race, putting the conservative leader on track to become the longest-serving premier despite a challenge by a former defense minister for the party post.
Shigeru Ishiba, 61, promising to restore trust in politics, announced his candidacy on Friday for a Liberal Democratic Party presidential election expected on Sept. 20.
But media surveys suggest Abe, who took office for a second time in December 2012 promising to revive the economy and bolster defense, has already locked in 70 percent of the 405 votes from LDP members of parliament. Another 405 votes will be apportioned based on votes by rank-and-file party members.
If no candidate wins a majority, a second round would be held with 405 votes from MPs and 47 from local party chapters.
Former foreign minister Fumio Kishida bowed out before the race began and Internal Affairs Minister Seiko Noda is struggling to find the 20 backers needed to get on the ballot for a shot at becoming the country's first female premier.
The winner of the LDP election gets a three-year term and is all but assured of the premiership because of the ruling bloc's majority in parliament.
Ishiba is counting on his grass-roots popularity, but analysts say that's unlikely to offset weak support among MPs.
Abe's ratings have recovered after falling to around 30 percent earlier this year amid scandals over suspected cronyism. He has denied wrongdoing. 
Still, a weekend survey by NHK public TV put voter support for Abe's cabinet at 41 percent, tied with the percentage expressing disapproval.
""If there is no jump in his support levels after re-election, it will expose the difference in temperature between the LDP and the rest of the country,"" said Sophia University professor Koichi Nakano.
Support for the LDP at 35.6 percent swamped the 5.6 percent for the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, but even more - 43.2 percent - had no party preference, the NHK poll showed. Local elections will be held nationwide next April and an upper house poll in July 2019. 
What Abe can accomplish in another term is unclear, including whether he can achieve his long-held but controversial goal of revising the pacifist post-war constitution.

The YouGov poll published on Friday showed that 39 percent of those asked said they would vote for the Conservatives, a gain of one point for May's party compared to last week when the pair were level. Labour dropped three points to 35 percent.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has been criticized by Jewish groups for what they describe as his tolerance of anti-Semitism in the party. Corbyn has said he will not tolerate anti-Semitism.
But the row has threatened Corbyn's standing at a time when the governing Conservatives are deeply divided over Brexit. 
The latest poll suggests a reversal in the recent trend of Labour benefiting from the Conservative infighting over May's plans for Britain to leave the European Union, which has raised the possibility of an early election.

The poll, which interviewed 1,675 adults in Britain earlier this week, showed that May extended her lead over Corbyn to 14 points, a jump of seven points on last week, on the question of who would be the best prime minister.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Three South Korean firms imported coal from North Korea disguised as Russian products in violation of U.N. resolutions in a fresh sign of loosening sanctions, South Korea's customs agency said on Friday. 
Seoul has been examining nine cases of potential imports of North Korean coal, which would breach a resolution passed last August by the U.N. Security Council to choke off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. 
The customs service did not identify the companies involved, but said about 35,000 tons of coal was brought into South Korea between April and October in 2017, worth 6.6 billion won ($5.8 million).
""The firms appear to have illicitly brought it in expecting big trading margins after prices of North Korean coal had dropped due to the import ban,"" Roh Suk-hwan, deputy commissioner of the Korea Customs Service, told a news conference. 
The agency said it would press charges against the firms and individuals involved for violating the customs law and forgery of private documents.
The government also plans to explore an entry ban or seizure of the 14 ships found to have transported the coal, the agency said. 
But there was no financial transaction made, which would constitute another violation of the U.N. sanctions, as the companies took coal in return for mediating trade between North Korea and Russia, Roh said.
The U.N. Security Council banned North Korea's sale of coal, iron, iron ore, lead, lead ore and seafood in a bid to slash by a third the country's $3 billion annual export incomes, while capping imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products.
The United States has led the sanctions campaign to press North Korea to give up its nuclear and missile programs. 
But across the region, there have been signs that U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign for ""maximum pressure"" lost steam after Pyongyang sought to improve relations with Washington, Seoul and Beijing. 
North Korean officials have toured China to discuss economic development and speculators are snapping up property along their common border. And South Korea is studying ways to boost engagement with the North.
Last month, Washington warned against loosening sanctions on Pyongyang after Russia and China suggested discussing such a move.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Hundreds of ethnic Hui Muslims are staging a sit-in protest in China's western region of Ningxia against government plans to demolish a huge new mosque, amid tightening curbs on Islam to pull its practice in line with the Chinese mainstream.
China officially guarantees freedom of religion, but in recent years officials nervous about the possibility of radicalization and violence have tightened controls in heavily Muslim areas. 
The Weizhou grand mosque, with numerous domes and minarets in a Middle Eastern style, had not received proper permits before construction, officials in the town of Weizhou said in a notice on Aug. 3.
The mosque would be forcibly demolished on Friday, they added in the notice, widely circulated among Chinese Muslims on social media. 
The order provoked anger among villagers, but talks between mosque representatives and officials have failed to reach agreement, as worshippers rejected a government plan to spare the mosque if its domes were replaced with pagodas more in keeping with Chinese style, one source in the area told Reuters.
Hundreds of villagers were gathering at the mosque on Friday morning, and the town's mayor was expected to hold discussions in the afternoon, added the source, who requested anonymity.
""If we sign, we are selling out our religious faith,"" a Weizhou mosque supporter said in a note on messaging app WeChat that was seen by Reuters, urging villagers not to sign on to the mosque rebuilding plan. 
""I can't talk about this issue,"" said Ding Xuexiao, the mosque's director, when reached by telephone. Mosque imam Ma Liguo said the situation was ""currently being coordinated"". Neither of the men would elaborate. 
There was a protest at the mosque on Friday, a man at a government religious office in the county, the Islamic Association, confirmed, adding that the government only wanted the structure ""renovated to reduce its scale"".
""The work with the public is ongoing. There has not been a specific consensus reached on the rectification plan,"" said the man, who declined to be identified.
Reuters could not immediately reach the Weizhou government to seek comment and officials in the surrounding county of Tongxin declined to comment.
Videos on social media on Thursday, which Reuters could not independently verify, showed large crowds gathered outside the mosque and police vans parked nearby. The protest appeared to be peaceful.
Senior Chinese officials have urged Muslims to guard against creeping Islamisation, such as foreign styles copied on mosques, and strive to practice their faith in a more ""Chinese"" way.
Well-integrated in society with decades of smooth ties with the government, many Hui have watched with detachment as authorities have subjected the far western region of Xinjiang and its Uighur Muslims to near-martial law, with armed police checkpoints, reeducation centers, and mass DNA collection.
The treatment of Uighurs has spurred an international outcry, with U.S. officials saying tens of thousands of people have been detained in Xinjiang's detention centers.
But Beijing's policy of ""Sinification"" of religion has increasingly alarmed many Hui, who fear it is widening its strict measures in Xinjiang to additional Muslim areas, such as Ningxia and neighboring Gansu province.
In the crackdown, the government has banned religious education for young people in mosques, ordered that the call to prayer over loudspeakers be silenced, and sought to stamp out what it sees as Arab elements in mosques.

Since winning a landslide election victory on July 1, leftist Lopez Obrador has painted himself an everyman president, forgoing the traditional trappings of the presidency, but the absence of armed guards has raised fears in a country reeling from political, gang and drug-related violence.
There were more fatal attacks on politicians during the last election campaign than in any other in recent history, and an epidemic of gang violence made last year Mexico's deadliest since modern records began.
Giving his first public comments a day after being officially named president-elect, Lopez Obrador said ten men and ten women would be chosen to provide his security, but described them as facilitators. He said they would not carry firearms, and protection would be kept at a minimum.
""They are going to take care of me. These women and men, and all Mexicans are going to take care of me. And when I talk about all the Mexicans I'm talking about the soldiers, because the soldiers are the people,"" Lopez Obrador said.
""All Mexicans are going to take care of me, but there will not be this special (government) body to guarantee the protection of the president of the republic.""
Lopez Obrador said he told current President Enrique Pena Nieto, who is protected by 2,000 armed presidential guards, composed of military personnel, police and civilians, that he would instead go with the much smaller security team.
Lopez Obrador has promised to run an austere, zero-deficit government, and his approach to security is a clear example of how he is breaking from the mold. The current presidential guards will be absorbed by the defense ministry once he takes office on Dec. 1.

He has promised to turn the presidential Los Pinos palace into a cultural center, have the presidential plane sold and receive half the salary of Pena Nieto.

1507,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 11:57PM ET</span>","Recount shows Iraq's Sadr retains election victory, no major changes","By Ahmed Aboulenein
BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Populist Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr retained his lead in Iraq's May parliamentary election, results of a nationwide recount of votes showed on Friday, positioning him to play a central role in forming the country's next government.
Iraq's Independent High Election Commission (IHEC) released the results of the recount on its website early on Friday. Parliament ordered the recount in June after widespread allegations of fraud cast doubt on the integrity of the ballot. 
The IHEC said the results of the recount matched the initial results from 13 of Iraq's 18 provinces.
The winning parties are still embroiled in negotiations over forming the next governing coalition three months after the vote, with no sign of an imminent conclusion.
The recount did not alter the initial results significantly, with Sadr keeping his tally of 54 seats.
A group of Iran-backed Shi'ite militia leaders remained second behind Sadr's bloc but gained an extra seat that pushed them to 48, with incumbent Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's bloc still in third place with 42 seats.
Abadi, who is seeking a second term in office, is heading a fragile caretaker government until a new one is formed.
The political uncertainty over the makeup of the new government has raised tensions at a time when public impatience is growing over poor basic services, unemployment and the slow pace of rebuilding after a three-year war with the Islamic State militant group.
Anger is mounting with frequent protests, backed by Iraq's top Shi'ite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, taking place in the Shi'ite southern provinces.
Sadr, who also backs the protests, has issued a list of 40 conditions he says the new prime minister has to meet, including being politically independent and not running for re-election, for his bloc to join a governing coalition and that he would go into opposition if the conditions were not met.
CONTENTIOUS RECOUNT
The manual recount has been politically contentious from the start, although it was never expected to widely alter the results.
The IHEC said on Monday it had completed the recount but was forced to cut the process short in the capital, Baghdad, because voting records had been destroyed by a warehouse fire two months ago.
The fire broke out hours after parliament ordered the recount and suspended the electoral commission's leadership, replacing it with a panel of judges, after a government report concluded there were serious violations in an initial count using an electronic vote-counting system.
The digitized system was intended to help regulate and speed up vote-counting. However, critics have claimed the tabulation system in electronic voting machines that were used for the first time were not secure enough from tampering.
The IHEC ignored an anti-corruption body's warnings about the credibility of the electronic machines used in the election, a document seen by Reuters showed.
The devices, provided by South Korean company Miru Systems under a deal with the IHEC, are at the heart of fraud allegations that led to the manual recount.
Concerns about the election count center on discrepancies in the tallying of votes by the voting machines, mainly in the Kurdish province of Sulaimaniya and the ethnically mixed province of Kirkuk, and suggestions that the devices could have been tampered with or hacked into in order to skew the result.
CONSTITUTIONAL TIMELINE
The United Nations had originally raised concerns about irregularities in voting, particularly in Kirkuk, which helped trigger the recount.
The initial results there were disputed by the Turkmen and Arab communities of the region which is also inhabited by a large Kurdish population.
However, the recount results showed no changes in Kirkuk and very limited changes in Sulaimaniya.
The results announced on Friday can be contested by parties and still have to be ratified by Iraq's Supreme Federal Court in order to become final.
When the court ratifies the result, a 90-day timeline for the formation of government spelled out in the constitution kicks in. Lawmakers will gather to elect a speaker, then president, and finally a prime minister and their cabinet.
The position of speaker is usually reserved for a Sunni Arab, the mostly ceremonial presidency for a Kurd, and the powerful prime minister always goes to Iraq's Shi'ite majority.

Negotiations are still expected to drag on, however, as the winning parties - who have competing interests and varying views on issues ranging from U.S. and Iranian influence on government to the integration of militias into the formal security apparatus - try and edge forward in Iraq's complex system of government formation based on coalition building.

Its two major nuclear project developers, China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) and the China General Nuclear Project Corporation (CGN), are jointly promoting an advanced third-generation reactor known as the Hualong One to overseas clients, with CGN aiming to deploy the technology at a proposed nuclear project at Bradwell in England.
The push to extend Chinese technological standards was disclosed in new cabinet guidelines published late on Thursday.
China aims to raise its total nuclear capacity to 58 gigawatts (GW) by the end of the decade, up from 37 GW at the end of June. 
Capacity could reach as high as 200 GW by 2030, and China also has ambitions to dominate the global nuclear industry via its homegrown technologies.

Security Council blacklist, diplomats said.
The list of proposed designations mirrors new sanctions announced by the U.S. Treasury last week.
The United States made the proposal to the 15-member U.N. Security Council North Korea sanctions committee, which operates by consensus.
Russia objected to the designations because it said the U.S. proposal was not ""adequately substantiated by sufficient information,"" diplomats said. China gave no reason for its objections.
Russia and China have suggested the Security Council discuss easing sanctions after U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met for the first time in June and Kim pledged to work toward denuclearization.
The United States and other council members have said there must be strict enforcement of sanctions until Pyongyang acts.
Last week, Washington imposed sanctions on Moscow-based Agrosoyuz Commercial Bank, North Korean banker Ri Jong Won, China-based Dandong Zhongsheng Industry & Trade Co Ltd and North Korea-based Korea Ungum Corporation. 
The U.S. Treasury Department said Agrosoyuz Commercial Bank had conducted ""a significant transaction"" for North Korean banker Han Jang Su, who had been blacklisted by Washington. Han is the Moscow-based chief representative of Foreign Trade Bank (FTB), North Korea's primary foreign exchange bank.
The Security Council blacklisted FTB in August last year. Ri is FTB's deputy representative in Moscow.
The U.S. Treasury said Dandong Zhongsheng Industry & Trade and Korea Ungum Corporation were FTB front companies.
The U.N. blacklist would impose a global travel ban and asset freeze on those designated.
Russia and China last month delayed a U.S. push for the Security Council sanctions committee to order a halt to refined petroleum exports to North Korea, asking for more detail on a U.S. accusation that Pyongyang breached sanctions, diplomats said.

Sanctions by the United States and the U.N. Security Council, which include a ban on exports of coal, iron, lead, textiles and seafood from North Korea, and caps on imports of oil and refined petroleum products, are aimed at choking off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.

1510,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 08:21PM ET</span>","U.S. census citizenship question panned by scientists, civil rights groups","By Nick Brown
(Reuters) - As the U.S. government closed a public comment period on Wednesday on its plans for the 2020 census, scientists, philanthropists and civil rights groups used the occasion to again criticize plans to include a question about U.S. citizenship. 
The comment period gave any member of the public a chance to comment on aspects of the census which is a mandatory, once-a-decade count of the U.S. population that next occurs in April 2020. 
The comments have not yet been published, but some groups and individuals reinforced their opposition to the Trump administration's plan to ask census respondents whether they are U.S. citizens.
At least 250,000 people have called for removing the question, according to a coalition of civil rights groups, led by the Leadership Conference Education Fund https://leadershipconferenceedfund.org/about on Wednesday. 
""This egregious citizenship question is a political effort to weaponize the census to redefine American democracy for a narrow set of people,” Vanita Gupta, the fund's president, said in a statement. 
A spokesman for the Education Fund said the group's tally included comments and petitions run by the groups themselves and was not an official count of comments submitted to the government. 
The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine http://www.nationalacademies.org's Committee on National Statistics, a prominent statistical organization, said in a letter to the U.S. Commerce Department on Tuesday that the question was ""inconsistent with the 'proper performance of the functions' of the Census Bureau,"" and should be removed. 
A coalition of more than 300 philanthropic groups, including the Annie E. Casey Foundation, the Ford Foundation and the Hewlett Foundation, called for removing the question. They said it would ""significantly undermine efforts to achieve a fair and accurate census in 2020."" 
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced in March the decennial census would ask citizenship status for the first time since 1950, explaining that the information would help enforce the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
The plan has drawn widespread scorn from city and state governments, scientists, and civil rights groups who think it is a politically driven effort to discourage immigrants from participating in the census. 
By law, the Census Bureau, part of the Department of Commerce, is not allowed to share individuals' data with law enforcement agencies, but some immigrants may nevertheless have that fear. 
Representatives for both the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Commerce, which oversees the bureau, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Because census data is used to apportion seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, dole out federal funding and serve as the basis for state-level political districts, an undercount of immigrants could affect a state or city's political representation for a decade.
Some 17 U.S. states and several cities, all with Democratic attorneys general or mayors, have sued the federal government, seeking to get the question removed.
Among those who support the question are scholars at the conservative Heritage Foundation and American Enterprise Institute, Republican U.S. Representatives Steve King and Clay Higgins, and Republican Senator John Kennedy.

""A census isn’t just a simple count of every man, woman and child,"" Kennedy said in April. ""It delves into economics, geography and other demographics. It certainly should be able to tell the story of our nation’s citizenship.”

ALEXANDRIA, Va. (Reuters) - The federal judge in the trial of U.S. President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort expressed contrition on Thursday to jurors after berating prosecutors for allowing a witness to watch the proceedings, despite having given his earlier approval.
The rare apology by U.S. District Court Judge T.S. Ellis surprised observers in his Alexandria, Virginia courtroom, who have watched the judge repeatedly criticize the government's handling of the case while giving leeway to Manafort's lawyers.
""It appears I may well have been wrong,"" Ellis said as the trial went into its eighth day. ""But like any human, and this robe doesn't make me anything other than human, I sometimes make mistakes."" 
Ellis had chastised prosecutors for allowing IRS agent Michael Welch to be in court before he testified on Wednesday, saying he did not like witnesses present before taking the stand. When prosecutor Uzo Asonye challenged Ellis, the judge barked: ""Don't do that again. When I exclude witnesses, I mean everybody."" 
Prosecutors had told Ellis he had approved having Welch and other expert witnesses attend the proceedings, a point they repeated in a court filing on Thursday asking for a ""curative instruction"" to the jury to set the record straight.
Some lawyers watching the case also noted Ellis did not rebuke defense attorney Kevin Downing on Wednesday after he asked the government’s star witness Rick Gates whether he had told prosecutors about four extramarital affairs.
Downing had agreed in a bench conference on Tuesday not to raise the subject with Gates, a court transcript showed. Downing later argued it was fair game because Gates had volunteered that he had one affair after being asked about his ""secret life.""
Ellis sustained an objection from the prosecution and Gates never answered the question about four affairs, but some observers said the damage had already been done.
""It was highly inappropriate to raise the other affairs, and the judge's response was very generous,"" said Gene Rossi, a former prosecutor who has been watching the trial. ""In my experience, another judge would have cut his head off.""
Gates, who was indicted along with Manafort, pleaded guilty and is cooperating with an investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
BANK FRAUD
Manafort has pleaded not guilty to 18 felony charges of bank fraud, tax fraud and failing to disclose some 30 foreign bank accounts. He is the first person to be tried on charges brought by Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.
Prosecutors said they plan to conclude their case on Friday. It is not clear whether Manafort will call any witnesses in his defense.
After wrapping up the tax portion of their case, prosecutors have moved on to bankers who were involved in extending Manafort loans during his scramble to generate cash in 2015 and 2016 after work dried up following a loss of business in Ukraine. 
Melinda James, a mortgage assistant at Citizens Bank, testified Thursday that Manafort provided incorrect information in applying for a $3.4 million loan on a Manhattan condominium that was granted on March 4, 2016.
She said Manafort did not disclose that a brownstone he owned in Brooklyn had a mortgage against it and indicated the Manhattan condominium was a second residence, when it was listed for rent. Both moves improved the loan terms, James said.
Earlier this week Gates testified Manafort directed him to present banks with false documents, including an inflated profit report for Manafort's consulting company, DMP International, LLC, to get the loans. Defense lawyers have made blaming Gates, Manafort's right-hand man for a decade, a key plank of their defense.
Manafort lawyer Jay Nanavati appeared to make some progress toward that goal on Thursday. Under his cross-examination, James acknowledged it was Gates, using an old insurance document, who ultimately misled her about whether there was a mortgage on the brownstone days before the loan on the condominium closed.
Taryn Rodriguez, a loan officer assistant at Citizens Bank, testified about an application for a $5.5 million construction loan on the brownstone that was ultimately denied. 
She said Manafort failed to disclose a multi-million dollar mortgage already taken out on the property and a $1 million business loan from the Banc of California, both of which would have affected any new loan. Rodriguez said she discovered the mortgage by researching a New York City database of property records.
Gary Seferian, a senior vice president at the Banc of California, said his bank gave Manafort the $1 million loan to rehabilitate and flip properties in the Los Angeles area, in part based on a financial statement for DMP International showing a profit of more than $4 million for 2015.

Prosecutor Uzo Asonye asked if Manafort would have qualified for the loan if he had known DMP's profit for that year was in fact $400,000. ""I don’t think so,"" Seferian said.

In 2017, Brazil had a murder rate of 30.8 per 100,000 people, up from 29.9 in 2016, according to data published by the Brazilian Public Security Yearbook 2018. Drug-scarred Mexico, which also suffered a record number of murders in 2017, had a homicide rate of around 20 per 100,000 people. 
The yearbook is published by the Brazilian Forum of Public Security, a think tank. 
Triggered by ever-more violent gangs capitalizing on tighter law enforcement budgets and a political void in the wake of massive graft scandals, growing violence is a key voter concern ahead of the October election.
Far-right lawmaker Jair Bolsonaro, who leads polling in the presidential race excluding jailed former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, wants to loosen gun laws and toughen up policing to tackle the rise in violence. 
His popularity has forced opponents including centrist former governor Geraldo Alckmin to join forces with law-and-order conservatives to bolster their crime-fighting credentials. 
The yearbook data showed that many of the record number of murders, which includes police killed in the line of duty, were concentrated in Brazil's poorer northeastern states. 
The state of Rio Grande do Norte had the highest murder rate in 2017, with 68 murders per 100,000 people, followed by Acre, in the far west of the country bordering Peru, with 63.9 per 100,000 people. 
The wealthier state of Sao Paulo had the lowest murder rate of any state, with 10.7 homicides per 100,000 people. 
In the absence of comprehensive federal crime data, the Brazilian Public Security Yearbook collects official state-level data and is used as a reference by the federal government.

The YouGov poll, commissioned by the pro-referendum ""People's Vote"" campaign group, found twice as many respondents favored the public rather than parliament taking a decision between remaining in the EU or leaving the bloc without a deal.
With less than eight months until Britain is due to leave the EU, Prime Minister Theresa May has yet to find a proposal to maintain economic ties with the bloc that pleases both sides of her divided party and is acceptable to negotiators in Brussels.
At the weekend, British trade minister Liam Fox warned he saw a 60 percent chance of a ""no-deal"" Brexit, which would see the world's fifth-largest economy quit the EU on March 29, 2019 without a trade agreement. Concerns over the prospect of that outcome have weighed on sterling.
The poll, conducted July 31-Aug. 7, found 45 percent of voters supported holding a referendum on completion of the negotiations whatever the outcome, while 34 percent opposed it.
Asked who should make the decision between staying or leaving if the talks broke down without a deal, 50 percent said it should be the public voting in a referendum while 25 percent said it should be lawmakers voting in parliament.
Faced with a three-way choice between remaining in the EU, leaving without a deal or accepting May's deal, 40 percent favored remaining, 27 percent wanted to leave without a deal and 11 percent would vote to leave with the deal proposed.
May has repeatedly ruled out holding another public vote on Brexit, saying the public spoke at a June 23, 2016, referendum, in which 51.9 percent of the votes cast backed leaving the EU while 48.1 percent backed staying.

The poll also found 74 percent of those questioned believed the negotiations were going badly, and 68 percent thought that made it likely Britain would get a bad deal.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Ontario on Thursday pledged $25 million for police and to keep suspects behind bars while they await trial on gun crimes charges, as the Canadian province grapples with rising shootings involving domestically obtained weapons.
For years, the primary source of guns used in Canadian crimes was the United States, with weapons smuggled across the world's longest unprotected border. 
That has changed in recent years with licensed gun-owners buying firearms legally and then illegally re-selling them into criminal networks, current and former police officers, Crown prosecutors and gun sellers said.
Last month, a gunman walked down Toronto's bustling Danforth Avenue, killing two people and wounding 13 before turning his gun on himself.
The mass shooting shook Canada's largest city and prompted calls for tougher action on gun control.
With stricter gun laws than the United States, Canada also does not have the gun culture or gun rights that exist in its southern neighbor. Still, it is legal for licensed civilians to own a range of firearms and purchase as many as they want after a waiting period.
In the wake of the Danforth shooting, the Toronto city council called on the federal government to ban handguns within city limits. 
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he would consider the idea and Minister Bill Blair, tasked with tackling gun violence, said the government is considering giving provinces the power to designate gun-free cities.
""It’s possible that we could work with the provinces and territories and allow them the authority to designate certain municipalities as places where guns could not be purchased or possessed,"" he told Reuters in an interview. 
Ontario Premier Doug Ford dismissed the idea of a handgun ban on Thursday, telling reporters ""there's a lot of legal, reasonable handgun owners ... We have to focus all our resources on going after the bad guys.""

Ontario will give Toronto police C$18 million and dedicate another C$7.6 million toward additional bail officers and ""legal SWAT teams"" to oppose bail for people accused of gun crimes. A government representative speaking on background said the teams would consist of an additional prosecutor and case manager in each Toronto courthouse dedicated to bail cases for gun crimes.

RUMICHACA BRIDGE (Reuters) - Thousands of Venezuelans overwhelmed the Ecuadorean-Colombian border high in the Andean mountains on Thursday, as fears of border closings led to a sudden surge in migrants from the ravaged OPEC-member country.
Impoverished Venezuelans are fleeing food shortages, hyperinflation, and violent crime in their homeland, often taking days-long bus rides across South America because they cannot afford flights. 
Ecuador's government on Wednesday declared a state of emergency in three provinces due to a jump in Venezuelans who arrived through Colombia. Authorities said up to 4,500 Venezuelans had crossed daily since the weekend, up from around 500 to 1,000 people previously.
Almost a dozen Venezuelans at the Rumichaca bridge, which divides the Ecuadorean-Colombian border, told Reuters they pushed forward their emigration out of fear that the porous Colombian-Venezuelan border, which most migrants cross at the start of their odyssey across South America, could be closed. 
""There were rumors that the border with Venezuela was going to be shut and I left early to avoid getting stuck,"" said Irene Bravo, 55, sitting on the ground surrounded by big bags as she waited to get her passport stamped by Colombian authorities. 
""The situation is unsustainable in Venezuela. Everything is expensive and you cannot afford to eat,"" added Bravo, who planned to continue on to Chile with her two sons and extended family. 
Around her, tired children slept on suitcases and adults huddled under flimsy blankets to try to ward off the cold mountain temperatures. 
Some Venezuelans said they had heard Colombia's new president, right-wing Ivan Duque, could toughen border crossings, while others said they feared leftist Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro would.
Duque is more hardline than his predecessor, centrist Juan Manuel Santos, but he has not mentioned anything about closing the border and stressed during his inauguration on Tuesday that Colombia had a duty to help its ""Venezuelan brothers.""
It was not clear what precipitated the rumor. It was not immediately possible to reach the Colombian government and Venezuela's Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. 
In the middle of the commotion at the border, musician Jose Ramon Sanchez played the harp, instantly cheering up his fellow Venezuelans who clapped at the sound of the traditional music from the grasslands and shouted ""Out with Maduro!"" 

""Playing the harp helps me calm the pain of having left my family,"" said Sanchez, 37, who left Venezuela's state of Barinas on July 23 and has been performing songs along the way to pay his way to Peru.

(Reuters) - A Chilean prosecutor said on Thursday that the office of the bishop to the armed services had been raided as part of investigations into accusations that senior Roman Catholic Church officials covered up claims of sexual abuse by clergymen in Chile.
Emiliano Arias, a provincial prosecutor leading the investigations, told Reuters that the raid on the office of Santiago Silva had been conducted by court order and authorized by the defense minister and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Silva is also president of the Chilean bishops' conference.
Arias said that a prosecutor accompanied by military officials had seized documents related to complaints made over 20 years to Silva and his predecessor, former bishop Juan Barros, about sexual abuse by clerics operating inside or outside the armed forces. 
Silva's office did not respond to requests for comment and the Chilean bishops' conference said Silva was out of the country and his office would not be commenting at this time. 
The raid was one of eight on offices of senior church figures as prosecutors search for evidence of accusations of sexual abuse by clergy not reported to the civilian police, and evidence of cover-ups, Arias has said.
The scandal has rocked the Church in Chile. Pope Francis encountered mass protests when he visited Chile in January.
In June, Chile's 34 bishops were summoned to Rome by the pope after Vatican investigators produced a 2,300-page report alleging that senior Church officials in Chile had failed to act on abuse claims and in some cases hid them. So far, the pope has accepted resignations by five of those bishops, including Juan Barros. 
Under Chilean law governing the separation Church and state, bishops are not obligated to report crimes committed inside the Church to the civilian authorities. 
Arias said that he believed military clergy, who hold military rank, were more answerable to civilian law. 

""They, unlike other Church figures, have an obligation to report crimes because they are members of the armed forces,"" he told Reuters.

(Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday ordered an immigrant mother and daughter brought back to the United States after learning during a court hearing that the government had put them on a deportation flight to El Salvador.
The pair were among 12 plaintiffs in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) challenging changes in asylum policies ordered by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
Washington D.C. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan was hearing a request to stay the plaintiffs' deportations, when the ACLU learned that two of them were already on a flight to Central America, the civil rights group said. 
Upon hearing the news, Sullivan ordered their flight returned and suggested that Sessions could be held in contempt of court, according to the ACLU. 
An official from the Department of Homeland Security said in an emailed statement that the agency is ""complying with the court’s order, and upon arrival in El Salvador, the plaintiffs did not disembark and are currently en route back to the United States.”
During the hearing, the judge ordered a temporary stay on deporting the nine women and three children who filed the lawsuit, according to a court filing. 
The lawsuit was filed on Tuesday in the District of Columbia by the ACLU. It challenges a recent tightening on standards for seeking U.S. asylum, which makes it far more difficult for those fleeing domestic or gang violence to win the right to remain in the United States.
Sessions has led efforts by the Trump Administration to crack down on illegal immigration, including the adoption of a zero tolerance policy that briefly included separating immigrant parents from their children while they were in U.S. detention.

The family separation policy led to widespread criticism and was abandoned in June.

A clause in the criminal code that allows such symbols to be used in a ""socially adequate"" way will now be applied to games just as it is to films, the German Entertainment Software Self-Regulation Body (USK) said on Thursday.
""In this context socially adequate means that symbols of unconstitutional organizations can be used in a title if it serves an artistic or scientific purpose or helps depict current events or history,"" USK Managing Director Elisabeth Secker said.
She added that games which clearly express opposition to the unconstitutional organization or its ideology, for example, could be considered ""socially adequate"".
All computer games sold on storage media in Germany have to be checked by the USK, which issues age ratings, but until now producers whose games contained banned symbols could not even hand them in for assessment, Secker said.
Now they will be able to hand them in - as long as they point out that they contain unconstitutional symbols - and the USK's independent classification committees will then decide on a case-by-case basis whether to allow the games to go on sale.
Secker said the general ban on symbols of unconstitutional organizations nonetheless remained in place.

There was controversy in Germany over the shooter game ""Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus"", which is set in a fictional 1961 after the Nazis won World War Two, because it appeared without swastikas and Hitler's moustache in Germany.

Akufo-Addo sacked Energy Minister Boakye Agyarko on Monday, and in the reshuffle he replaced him with John Peter Amewu, former minister of lands and natural resources. Press reports said Agyarko was removed because the president was unhappy with his handling of an extension to a five-year deal with United Arab Emirates-based AMERI Energy for a 300MW emergency power plant.
Kwaku Asomah-Cheremeh, former regional minister for the Brong Ahafo region, was named minister for lands and natural resources, while Kofi Adda, a former minister of sanitation and water resources, was appointed the minister of aviation.
Critics and local media say the number of Ghana's ministers is bloated and is a drain on the public purse, but the government has resisted calls to axe some of them.
Ghana, one of the region's most dynamic economies, became an energy producer in late 2010, and pumps out around 180,000 barrels of oil per day from three main fields.
But large amounts of this revenue are spent on government salaries, while Ghana has suffered from falls in commodity prices in the past three years that forced it to go to the IMF for a bailout.

It is now in its final year of the $918 million credit deal signed in April 2015 to fix its economy, dogged by high deficits, inflation and public debt.

SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea on Thursday denounced U.S. calls for enforcing international sanctions despite its goodwill moves and said progress on denuclearization promises could not be expected if Washington followed an ""outdated acting script.""
North Korea's foreign ministry said Pyongyang had stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled a nuclear test ground and returned the remains of some U.S. soldiers killed in the 1950-53 Korean War.
Yet Washington was still insisting on ""denuclearization first"" and had ""responded to our expectation by inciting international sanctions and pressure"" it said.
""As long as the U.S. denies even the basic decorum for its dialogue partner and clings to the outdated acting script which the previous administrations have all tried and failed, one cannot expect any progress in the implementation of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement including the denuclearization,"" the ministry said.
The statement on the KCNA state news agency said North Korea, which calls itself the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, was still willing to implement a broad agreement made at a landmark June 12 summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
But it accused unidentified high-level U.S. officials of ""going against the intention of President Trump"" by ""making baseless allegations against us and making desperate attempts at intensifying the international sanctions and pressure.""
It said ""expecting any result, while insulting the dialogue partner"" was ""a foolish act that amounts to waiting to see a boiled egg hatch out.""
The White House did not respond to requests for comment.
Kim vowed in Singapore to work toward denuclearization but the two sides have yet to define a deal to meet that goal and Washington insists sanctions pressure must be maintained during negotiations.
The North Korean statement followed comments this week by top American diplomats stressing the need for Pyongyang to take additional steps toward denuclearization and contentious remarks last week by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and North Korean Foreign Minster Ri Yong Ho on the sidelines of a regional summit in Singapore.
Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, said this week that Pyongyang had not taken the necessary steps to denuclearize while U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said Washington was ""not willing to wait for too long.""
Bolton, who spoke on Tuesday, said Trump, in a letter to Kim, proposed sending Pompeo back to North Korea, and that Trump was ready to meet with Kim any time.
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told a regular briefing on Thursday that the United States was in touch with North Korea virtually every day or other day but had no travel plans to announce for the moment.
Ri traveled this week to Iran, where President Hassan Rouhani told him the United States cannot be trusted after the Trump administration reneged on a 2015 deal to lift sanctions in return for curbs on Iran's own nuclear program.
U.S. officials have declined to comment on a report on the Vox news website on Wednesday saying that North Korea had repeatedly rejected a U.S. proposal for it to cut its nuclear arsenal by 60 to 70 per cent within six to eight months.
U.S. officials familiar with the talks, however, told Reuters that North Korea had yet to agree to a timeline for eliminating its nuclear arsenal or to disclose its size, which U.S. estimates have put at between 30 and 60 warheads.
They said it had also not agreed to definitions of the key terms of any agreement, or to any inspection of its nuclear test site, which it claims to have decommissioned, but which U.S. intelligence officials have said may still be operable.

Two U.S. officials said North Korea appeared to view Trump as a softer touch. They said that when a session with Pompeo reached an impasse last month, North Korean officials asked if he would like to step outside to call the president, who declared after the June summit that North Korea was ""no longer a nuclear threat.""

Several journalists, including one from German broadcaster Deutsche Welle, were detained on Wednesday and Tuesday. Investigators also searched the newsrooms of privately-owned online news portal Tut.by and independent news agency BelaPAN as part of the same probe.
""After carrying out a set of urgent investigative and other procedural actions as part of the criminal case, the investigation has decided to release ... the persons connected to the case,"" investigators said in a statement.
Local rights groups have said the arrests were part of a government drive to muzzle independent media - an allegation the Belarussian Foreign Ministry has denied. 
President Alexander Lukashenko has run Belarus along Soviet-style command lines since 1994. He has heeded some calls from the West to show more leniency towards political opposition, but opponents say their freedom to operate remains severely limited.

GAZA/SDEROT, Israel (Reuters) - Israeli aircraft struck more than 150 targets in Gaza on Wednesday night and early Thursday, and Palestinian militants fired scores of rockets including a long-range missile deep into Israel, escalating fighting despite talks on a truce to avert an all-out conflict.
After the long-range Palestinian missile attack, the first of its kind since a 2014 war, Israeli air strikes resumed on Thursday afternoon, flattening a multi-storey building that the Israeli military described as a Hamas headquarters.
Israel has fought three wars in the past decade with Hamas, the Islamist group that controls the Gaza strip. A surge in cross border rocket and air strikes in recent weeks have prompted the United Nations and Egypt to try to broker a truce to prevent another one.
A pregnant Palestinian woman and her 18-month-old child were killed in the Israeli attacks overnight, as was a Hamas militant, local medical officials said. Hundreds of people took part in the funeral for the woman and child on Thursday.
The Israeli military said seven people were wounded by Palestinian rockets and mortars that hit southern Israel across the border.
Ambulance sirens echoed through the night in Gaza, where families huddled at home as powerful explosions thundered through the strip. Across the border rocket warning sirens sounded almost non-stop from sunset on Wednesday in Israeli towns and villages where residents sheltered in bunkers.
The Israeli military said its aircraft had struck more than 150 Hamas targets overnight, while more than 180 Palestinian rockets and mortars hit southern Israel.
Egypt and the United Nations are trying to mediate a truce to prevent the escalation in fighting turning into another all-out war over Gaza, a narrow strip of land that is home to 2 million Palestinians, mainly stateless descendants of people who fled or were driven from Israel in war at its founding in 1948.
The long-range missile fired on Thursday was the first of its kind since the 2014 war. Twenty-five miles from the border, air raid sirens rang out in Israel's main southern city Beersheba. Israeli Army Radio said militants had fired a Grad missile capable of reaching Israel's heartland. Israeli Police said they found its remnants in an open area on the outskirts of the city of 200,000 people and that no one was hurt.
Israel responded by hitting the multi-storey building, first with small bombs apparently so that people would evacuate, then flattening it to the ground with a huge blast that shook the city and raised clouds of dust and smoke.
Residents said the building had served mainly as a cultural center. Local health officials said 18 bystanders were wounded outside of the building by the blast. Hamas denied using the facility. 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened his security cabinet late into the night on Thursday. A statement issued by his office said the forum instructed the military to ""keep acting with force against the terrorists"".
TRUCE SOUGHT
Israel captured Gaza in a 1967 war but withdrew in 2005, while holding onto most of the separate West Bank, where Palestinians have limited self-rule. For more than a decade Gaza has been controlled by Hamas under an Israeli-Egyptian blockade that has collapsed its economy, creating what the World Bank has described as a humanitarian crisis with shortages of water, electricity and medicine.
Israel says it has no choice but to enforce its blockade to defend itself against Hamas, which calls for Israel's destruction and has used Gaza as a base for missile attacks.
Earlier on Thursday, a Palestinian official said armed factions in Gaza were prepared to halt their rocket attacks on southern Israel if the Israeli military stopped its air strikes.
""Factions of the resistance consider this round of escalation over as far as we are concerned, and the continuation of calm depends on the behavior of the occupation,"" the Palestinian official said.
The official, at a command center used by armed groups in Gaza, said they had been ""responding to crimes"" by Israel - a reference to the killing on Tuesday, in disputed circumstances, of two Hamas gunmen.
Yuval Steinitz, a member of Netanyahu's security cabinet, told Israel Radio earlier that Israel was ""not eager for war"" but would make no concessions to Hamas.

U.N. Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov said the United Nations had engaged with Egypt in an ""unprecedented effort"" to avoid serious conflict, but ""the situation can rapidly deteriorate with devastating consequences for all people"".

1525,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 03:15PM ET</span>","Dozens killed, including children on a bus, in Yemen air strikes","ADEN (Reuters) - Saudi-led coalition air strikes on Thursday killed dozens of people, including children traveling on a bus through a market, in Yemen's Saada province, a Yemeni health official and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said.
The Western-backed alliance fighting the Iranian-aligned Houthi group in Yemen said in a statement that the air strikes targeted missile launchers used to attack the southern Saudi city of Jizan on Wednesday, killing a Yemeni civilian there.
It accused the Houthis of using children as human shields and said the strikes were carried out in accordance with international humanitarian law.
Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdul-Salam said the coalition showed ""clear disregard for civilian life"" as the attack had targeted a crowded public place in the city.
The ICRC said a strike hit the bus driving children in Dahyan market, in northern Saada.
""Our shops were open and shoppers were walking around as usual. All of those who died were residents, children and shop owners,"" witness Moussa Abdullah, who was being treated in hospital for wounds, told Reuters.
The ICRC said on its Twitter account that its medical team at the ICRC-supported hospital in Saada had received the bodies of 29 children, all under 15 years old. The hospital also received 48 wounded people, among them 30 children.
That was the toll at just one hospital.
Abdul-Ghani Sareeh, from Saada health department, told Reuters: ""A bus carrying children was targeted today while they were coming from summer school resulting in 43 martyrs and almost 63 wounded.""
White plastic body bags filled the floor of a room in the ICRC-supported hospital. 
Injured children, bloodied, bandaged and screaming, lay on stretchers as doctors treated them, friends and relatives having carried some of them in their arms to be treated. 
""Scores killed, even more injured, most under the age of 10,"" Johannes Bruwer, head of the delegation for the ICRC in Yemen, said earlier in a Twitter post. 
It was unclear how many of the dead in total were children and how many air strikes were carried out in the area, in northern Yemen, near the border with Saudi Arabia. 
""RED LINE"" 
Saudi Arabia and Sunni Muslim allies intervened in Yemen's war in 2015 against the Houthis, who control the most populous areas of Yemen, including the capital Sanaa, and drove the internationally recognized government into exile in 2014.
The United States and other Western powers provide arms and intelligence to the alliance, and human rights groups have criticized them over coalition air strikes that have killed hundreds of civilians at hospitals, schools and markets.
""Grotesque, shameful, indignant. Blatant disregard for rules of war when bus carrying innocent school children is fair game for attack,"" Jan Egeland, head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said in a Twitter post.
The World Health Organization (WHO) representative in Yemen, Nevio Zagaria, said it has deployed emergency supplies. ""I am extremely saddened by what happened in Saada ... The attack on civilians is not acceptable.""
The alliance says it does not intentionally target civilians and has set up a committee to probe alleged mass casualty air strikes, which has mostly cleared the coalition of any blame.
""Today's attack in Saada was a legitimate military operation ... and was carried out in accordance with international humanitarian law,"" the coalition said in the Arabic-language statement carried by SPA.
""Targeting Saudis and residents in Saudi is a red line,"" coalition spokesman Turki al-Malki later told Al Arabiya TV.
A U.S. military spokeswoman said ""U.S. Central Command was not involved in the air strike in Saada."" Its last air strike in Yemen was July 24 against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, she said, adding that the command seeks to help partners mitigate civilian casualties.
Fragments from the Houthi missile launched at Jizan Industrial City killed one Yemeni civilian and wounded 11, Saudi state media said earlier on Thursday.
The Houthis have launched a series of missile strikes on the kingdom, including Riyadh, over the past year. 
Saada, the main stronghold of the Houthis, has mainly come under air strikes from the coalition as the mountainous province makes battles hard for pro-government ground troops.

The Yemen war has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced more than 2 million and driven the country to the verge of famine, according to the United Nations.

HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe's former finance minister and opposition leader Tendai Biti appeared in court on Thursday to be charged with stoking post-election violence in a case watched around the world as a test of President Emmerson Mnangagwa's treatment of opponents.
Biti, whose People's Democratic Party had formed an election alliance with Nelson Chamisa's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), sought asylum in neighboring Zambia on Wednesday but was deported back to Zimbabwe in a move condemned by the United States.
He was also charged with falsely and unlawfully announcing results of the July 30 election, which Chamisa rejected as fraudulent and is set to challenge in the Constitutional Court on Friday. 
If found guilty, Biti could face up to 10 years in jail, a cash fine or both. He was released on bail and will appear in court again on Friday.
""It's been an ordeal, but we survive. We live to fight another day, I am glad to be home,"" Biti told reporters soon after his release.
The United States said it was concerned about reports of detentions, beatings and other abuses targeting opposition activists. It singled out the case of Biti and signaled that Zambia could face consequences for its role in handing him back.
""We will be discussing this matter with Zambia’s leaders and reviewing certain aspects of our cooperation with the Zambian government,"" the State Department said in a statement.
The United Nations refugee agency, the UNHCR, said it would be a serious violation of international law if Zambian authorities had handed Biti over despite a court order to the contrary, which his lawyer said had indeed been issued by the Zambian High Court.
The European Union, Australia and Canada also said they were ""deeply disturbed by continuing reports that opposition supporters are being targeted by members of the Zimbabwean security forces"".
PRESIDENT INTERVENES
Most Zimbabweans had hoped the parliamentary and presidential elections would end the country's pariah status and help usher in an economic recovery. Instead, it has plunged into turmoil reminiscent of contested votes during Robert Mugabe's 37 years of rule until he was ousted by the military last November.
Biti had been in hiding since last week, when six people were killed in a widely condemned army crackdown on protests over the declaration of victory by Mnangagwa's ruling ZANU-PF party.
State prosecutors did not oppose bail for Biti, which was set at $5,000. He was ordered to surrender his passport and title deeds to his house, and banned from addressing political rallies or news conferences until the case is over.
Aware of the potential damage to Zimbabwe's image, Mnangagwa said he had intervened to ensure Biti was released. But he also said that Biti faced serious charges and that the legal process should be allowed to take its course.
""At such a crucial time in the history of the new Zimbabwe, nothing is more important than unity, peace and dialogue. I call on all parties to immediately cease from all forms of incitement to violence,"" Mnangagwa wrote on his official Twitter page.
Some fear the post-election turmoil will derail the chances of mending an economy facing acute shortages of cash and desperate for foreign investment.
Speaking in court to lawyers and the media, Biti said he had feared being abducted by the security forces. ""They wanted to abduct me. I was terrified,"" he said.

The outspoken politician was also arrested in 2008 for announcing that the late MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai had won a presidential vote. Official results later showed Tsvangirai beat Mugabe but not by enough votes to avoid a runoff.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian President Joko Widodo said on Thursday he had chosen 75-year-old Islamic cleric Ma'ruf Amin as his running mate in next year's presidential election.
The two will be challenged by former general Prabowo Subianto and his vice presidential candidate pick, the deputy governor of Jakarta, Sandiaga Uno.
Indonesia, the world's third-largest democracy and biggest Muslim-majority country, goes to the polls in April.
The contest, at least in terms of the presidential candidates, is shaping up as a repeat of the 2014 election, when political outsider Widodo defeated Prabowo, who has deep ties to Indonesia's business and military elite.
Widodo is a popular moderate who has had mixed success with his reform agenda. Prabowo is a charismatic nationalist with strong links to Islamists who frequently rails against foreigners.
On a dramatic day of political maneuvering and intrigue, Widodo made a surprise decision to pick Amin, just hours after former chief justice Mahfud MD appeared to confirm he was the vice presidential choice of Widodo.
Amin is the influential head of the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI), who issued a statement condemning Widodo's political ally, the ethnic Chinese Christian former Jakarta governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, as a blasphemer for insulting the Koran in the middle of a heated Jakarta election campaign.
Prabowo's candidate for Jakarta governor won the election, which analysts and rights advocates condemned for inflaming sectarian sentiment.
Amin had been a presidential adviser and had served in local and national legislatures in the past.
""Maybe there are questions from the people all over Indonesia why Professor Dr. Ma'ruf Amin was chosen. Because he is a wise religious figure,"" said Widodo.
""I think we complete each other, nationalistic and religious.""
But Human Rights Watch researcher Andreas Harsono told Reuters Amin, as head of the MUI, had overseen a rise in religious intolerance across Indonesia, a pluralist country with significant minority communities.
""He issued fatwas condemning religious and gender minorities like the Ahmadiyah and LGBT individuals at a time they were subject to violent assaults,"" he said.
DIVISIONS
""He also oversaw the creation of so-called religious harmony forums across the country. These forums replaced the principle of religious freedom, stoked divisions and favored the majority Sunni Muslim community."" 
Prabowo said his candidacy was supported by three political parties, but left out the Democrat Party in his nomination speech in an apparent sign of rifts in the opposition coalition. 
""It is not easy to build a coalition because many things have to be brought together,"" Prabowo said.
The Democrat Party views the choice of Uno as a betrayal. Just last week, chairman of the party, former president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, and Prabowo's Gerindra party announced an alliance.
Agus Yudhoyono, a 39-year-old retired soldier and the ex-president's son, was expected to be the vice presidential candidate after the deal.
An hour before Prabowo's near-midnight announcement, the Democrat party threatened to quit the coalition unless Prabowo went with the younger Yudhoyono or reconsidered his pick for running mate, party secretary general Andi Arief said on his Twitter account.
Arief had earlier tweeted a stream of derogatory comments about Prabowo.
Former investment banker Uno said he would work with Prabowo ""to present a strong government ... build the economy and stabilize food prices"". 
Uno played a pivotal role plotting the campaign to oust then incumbent governor Purnama. After the victory, Uno said it was regrettable race and religion had dominated the campaign.
Gerindra's deputy chairman Arief Poyuono said the Prabowo-Uno team would mean the opposition had candidates from both Java and outside Indonesia's most populous island. Uno has roots in Gorontalo in Sulawesi.

Many Indonesians from outside Java resent Java's political and economic dominance.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A mechanic helping to fight one of several major wildfires in California died in a traffic collision on Thursday, bringing the death toll from that blaze to eight, officials said.
The mechanic was assigned to the Carr Fire burning around Redding in Northern California and died in a crash on Highway 99 in nearby Tehama County, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said in a statement.
The CalFire statement did not name the mechanic nor provide more details.
The 176,000-acre (71,224-hectare) Carr Fire, roughly 200 miles (322 km) north of San Francisco, has killed two other firefighters along with three members of one family and has destroyed nearly 1,100 homes. It was 48 percent contained with firefighters struggling in steep terrain to control the blaze, CalFire said.
Nine other major fires are burning in California, including the Mendocino Complex Fire north of San Francisco. The two fires close to each other are being treated as one event and now rank as the largest fire on record in the state. Altogether, the wildfires have displaced tens of thousands of people in California. 
A force of more than 4,000 firefighters made progress overnight in controlling the Mendocino Complex Fire, which has burned more than 304,400 acres (123,000 hectares), Cal-Fire said on Thursday. Two firefighters have been injured and 119 homes destroyed by that fire.
HOLY FIRE
Winds gusting up to 35 miles (56 km) an hour and temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 C) are forecast from Thursday afternoon to Saturday in northern California, the National Weather Service said in a Red Flag warning.
To the south, in the Cleveland National Forest area of Orange County near Los Angeles, the 9,600-acre (3,885-hectare) Holy Fire is 5 percent contained, the Cleveland National Forest said on Twitter on Thursday. 
A 51-year-old man, Forrest Clark, arrested on suspicion of setting the fire was charged with multiple criminal counts including aggravated arson and making criminal threats, the Orange County District Attorney Office said in a statement on Thursday.
Clark, who faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted, was held on bail of $1 million and was expected to be arraigned in court on Thursday.

The Holy Fire has displaced 20,000 people, the Orange County Sheriff's Office said.

MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (Reuters) - At least 15 soldiers and an official from Nigeria's disaster agency were killed in an ambush by suspected Boko Haram militants in the northeast of the country, security sources said on Thursday, weeks after 20 troops went missing in an attack.
The ambush occurred late on Wednesday in the northern Damasak area of Borno, the state worst hit by the jihadist group which has killed more than 30,000 people since 2009, when it launched an insurgency to create an Islamic caliphate.
It highlights the challenge to secure the northeast months ahead of a February election President Muhammadu Buhari plans to contest in which security looks set to be a campaign issue. 
In July a fourth commander in 14 months was named to lead the fight against the militants after a number of embarrassing defeats. 
Two soldiers and a staff member from the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) said that 15 troops and a NEMA official who was with them were killed in the latest incident. 
""We lost 15 troops. Our men were carrying out digging of trenches at Damasak yesterday when the Boko Haram terrorists opened fire on them,"" said a soldier who did not want to be named. The NEMA worker, who also did not want to be named, said 18 were killed.
NEMA also released a statement in which it confirmed the death of an official in the attack.
""The Director General of the National Emergency Management Agency, Engr. Mustapha Maihaja and the management staff have been thrown into mourning following a death of a staff who was killed by Boko Haram yesterday in Damasak, Borno state,"" it said.
The deaths come after 20 Nigerian soldiers went missing in mid-July following a clash with militants in the Bama area of Borno. Military sources say the troops are feared dead.
Boko Haram had held territory around the size of Belgium in northeast Nigeria for several months until being pushed off much of that land in early 2015 by Nigeria's army and soldiers from neighboring countries.
Nigeria's government has said since December 2015 that the insurgents have been ""technically defeated"". Yet attacks continue in the northeast, while another group, an Islamic State ally that split from Boko Haram in 2016, also holds some territory.

After years of speculation over his intentions, Kabila consented to obey the two-term limit imposed by Democratic Republic of Congo's constitution on Wednesday, by not entering his name into a poll set for Dec. 23.
As a parting shot, he picked a hard-core former interior minister, who has been placed under EU sanctions, to stand instead.
But whatever concerns Western powers might have over Kabila's favored successor, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary -- who is under sanctions for his alleged role in the suppression of protests with live bullets, killing scores of demonstrators -- this wasn't the time to voice them.
""We applaud the decision by President Joseph Kabila to respect the Congolese constitution,"" said the statement, also signed by Canada and Switzerland. It added that this ""constitutes a key stage on the path toward the first peaceful change of power in DRC."" 
Congo is Africa's top producer of copper and the world's leading miner of cobalt, which is prized for its use in electric car batteries.
Kabila has been in power for 17 years, since his father and predecessor as president, Laurent Kabila, was assassinated in 2001. The only two previous changes of power in Congo have been at the barrel of a gun.
The U.S. State Department had earlier described Kabila's move as ""a significant step forward for Congolese democracy."" 
But State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert added: ""Government, opposition, and civil society leaders, along with the heads of the security services share with President Kabila the responsibility of ensuring full respect for democratic norms.""
The joint statement called for ""transparent, peaceful and inclusive"" elections. 
Kabila was due to step down in 2016 at the end of his constitutional mandate. But he stayed on while the election was repeatedly delayed, stoking militia violence and sparking protests in which the security forces killed dozens of people. 

Kabila had come under strong pressure from regional allies such as Angola, as well as the United States and EU, to stand down.

Nominated by ethnic Serb lawmakers, ethnic Serb Radomir Laban was approved by a vote in parliament in May but Thaci was urged by the opposition and a justice watchdog not to appoint him before all the security checks were done.
""He is still a wanted person by Belgrade authorities,"" a senior police source told Reuters. ""There is an Interpol red notice warrant and if he goes outside the country his name will appear at any airport.""
Thaci's office said in a statement it had appointed Laban with a photograph of him and four other judges taking their oaths, without giving further details. Neither the office nor Laban were available for further comment.
Laban will be one of nine judges at the court, filling one of the posts set aside for the country's minorities. Ethnic Serbs make up about 5 percent of the population.
According to Serbia’s court records, Laban, who has a law degree, was sentenced in 2011 to six years in jail for corruption as an official of the Serbian Customs. He served half his sentence in pre-trial detention between 2006 and 2009.
After the trial, Laban was provisionally released until he would be called to serve the rest of his sentence, but instead he fled to neighboring Kosovo. Last year, a Serbian court in the town of Kraljevo issued an arrest warrant demanding he be handed back to Serbia.
The background of the candidates for judges is checked by Kosovo law enforcement agencies, but Laban’s case will be difficult to solve because of Serbia’s refusal to cooperate with authorities in Pristina. Serbia does not recognize its former province.

The Crimea-born Sentsov, sentenced by a Russian court to 20 years in a high security penal colony in 2015 for ""terrorist attacks"" on the peninsula, is on the 88th day of a hunger strike.
Sentsov was accused of setting fire to two office buildings in Crimea, including one of Russia's ruling party, and of plotting to blow up a monument to Soviet state founder Vladimir Lenin. 
He was charged with organizing a ""terrorist group"" in Crimea aiming to wrest the peninsula back from Moscow's control. Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. 
The film director has denounced the trial as politically motivated, amid high tension between Russia and the West over the annexation.
Sentsov's mother Ludmila wrote to Putin on June 22. 
""I ask you... not to ruin his life,"" the letter, published by the Echo of Moscow radio station, said. 
""He has now spent four years in prison. His children are waiting for him, and his youngest son has autism. They are struggling without him,"" she wrote.
On Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed the letter was received.
A commission must now be set up to gather reports on Sentsov's health, behavior and mental state, a journalist from the Novaya Gazeta newspaper cited Sentsov's lawyer as saying.
The commission will then assess whether he presents a danger to society and will make a recommendation for Putin to review, the lawyer, Dmitry Dinze, was cited as saying.
40 BEATS A MINUTE
Sentsov's health is rapidly declining, his lawyer and a relative said. 
""Things are not just bad, they're catastrophically bad,"" Sentsov's cousin, Natalya Kaplan, wrote on social media on Wednesday.
""He can barely get up. He writes that the end is near, and he's not referring to when he will be freed,"" Kaplan said.
Speaking to Ukrainian newspaper Hromadske on Tuesday, Sentsov's lawyer said the filmmaker's heartbeat had slowed to 40 beats per minute and he was suffering from anemia. 
Amnesty International said it had requested access to visit Sentsov together with medical experts, but was denied. 

""The Federal Correctional Service told us that his health is stable and they see no changes for the worse. But that information is two weeks old. Sadly, we know as little as everyone else,"" Amnesty's Aleksander Artemev said.

Michal Konrad Herba, who had been living in Britain, is accused of taking part in the kidnap of Chloe Ayling, who was held captive for six days after being lured to a photo shoot in Italy in July last year. 
In a number of media interviews, Ayling, 21, said she was drugged, gagged, bound, stuffed into a bag, put into a car boot and driven to a small town close to the northern city of Turin. 
According to her account, four or five men were involved in the kidnapping. 
Lukasz Pawel Herba, Michal's brother, was sentenced in June to serve 16 years in prison and pay 60,000 euros ($69,500) in damages to Ayling, who was a civil plaintiff in the trial.
Michal was extradited to Italy after being arrested by British police in Birmingham, acting on a European arrest warrant issued by Italian authorities. His trial will start in Milan on Oct. 24.

1537,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 10:28AM ET</span>",Assange considers offer to appear before U.S. Senate committee,"By Michael Holden
LONDON (Reuters) - WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has been holed up in Ecuador's London embassy for six years, is considering an offer to appear before a U.S. Senate committee to discuss alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, his lawyer said on Thursday.
WikiLeaks published a letter from the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee on Wednesday which asked Assange to make himself available to testify in person at a closed hearing as part of its investigation into whether Moscow meddled to help Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election.
Russia rejects the claims and Trump has denied any collusion.
""The U.S. Senate Select Committee request confirms their interest in hearing from Mr Assange,"" lawyer Jennifer Robinson said in a statement.
""The inquiry has asked for him to appear in person at a mutually agreeable time and place. We are seriously considering the offer but must ensure Mr Assange's protection is guaranteed.""
Assange has been living in the Ecuadorean embassy since he was granted asylum in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden to face questions about allegations of sex crimes, accusations that were later dropped.
However, he would be arrested by British police for breaching bail conditions should he leave the building, and he has always said he fears being extradited to the United States for having published a huge cache of U.S. diplomatic and military secrets on the WikiLeaks website.
There were no details about how any interview with the U.S. senators would be carried out, and a spokesman for Assange said: ""Anything is possible with this"".
""'In person' hasn't been ruled out,"" he added. 
Ahead of the 2016 election, WikiLeaks published emails hacked from the Democratic Party and the personal email account of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman.
Last month, a U.S. federal grand jury charged 12 Russian intelligence officers with hacking the Democratic computer networks as part of Moscow's meddling in the election to help Republican Trump.
The U.S. committee's request comes at a time of growing speculation about Assange's future and his possible ejection from the embassy after six years.
On a visit to Madrid last month, Ecuadorean President Lenin Moreno confirmed that Ecuador and Britain were in talks to try to end his stay at the embassy.

Days earlier, a source close to Assange told Reuters that the diplomatic impasse was coming to a head.

Keita, who is seeking a second term despite jihadist attacks and inter-ethnic violence, won the first round last month with over 41 percent of the vote. Cisse finished second with nearly 18 percent.
Cisse has alleged there was widespread fraud in the first round and has been trying to unite the other two dozen candidates behind him for the run-off.
Keita's camp denies there was fraud and the constitutional court on Wednesday upheld the results, despite challenges by Cisse, third-place finisher Aliou Diallo and fourth-placed Cheick Modibo Diarra. 
But Diallo, who received 8 percent of the vote, and Diarra, who claimed over 7 percent, both encouraged their supporters to make up their own minds for the second round. 
""Neither IBK (Keita) nor Soumi (Cisse) corresponds with our political ideal. I will not support one or the other. Each person who voted for me is free to vote for whom they wish,"" Diarra told supporters in the capital Bamako. 
Diallo told his followers that it was ""to Malians that I leave the responsibility of expressing themselves as they wish in the second round"". 
Armed attacks and other security incidents disrupted voting at about a fifth of polling places in the first round and prevented around 3 percent from opening at all, casting doubts over the legitimacy of the election.

The United Nations said last month nearly 300 Malian civilians had been killed this year in inter-communal violence, which has been stoked by local jihadi groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State.

Judges at the court had asked Myanmar to respond to the request by July 27. The office of government leader Aung San Suu Kyi outlined reasons why Myanmar has declined to engage with the court on the matter and why it would not submit a response.
""The request by the prosecutor may be interpreted as an indirect attempt to acquire jurisdiction over Myanmar which is not a State Party to the Rome Statute,"" the office said in a statement, referring to the ICC's founding treaty.
Reuters was not able to immediately reach the ICC for comment.
The jurisdiction of the world’s first permanent war crimes court is limited to crimes committed on the territory of member states, or in cases referred to it by the U.N. Security Council.
But ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda has asked the court to look into the Rohingya crisis and the court has sought the views of Bangladesh on the ""exercise of territorial jurisdiction over the alleged deportation of members of the Rohingya people from Myanmar into Bangladesh"".
Suu Kyi's office said Myanmar was ""under no obligation to enter into litigation with the prosecutor"" and setting the jurisdiction over the case would ""set a dangerous precedent whereby future populistic causes and complaints against non-State Parties ... may be litigated."" 
Myanmar has also alleged procedural irregularities and lack of transparency on the court's part.
Bensouda has said that, given the cross-border nature of the crime of deportation, a ruling in favour of ICC jurisdiction would be in line with established legal principles. 
However, she acknowledged uncertainty around the definition of the crime of deportation and limits of the court’s jurisdiction.
About 700,000 Rohingya Muslims, according to U.N. estimates, fled from Buddhist-majority Myanmar to Bangladesh after a military crackdown in August 2017 that the United Nations has called ethnic cleansing.

Refugees have reported killings, rape and arson on a large scale, but Myanmar has denied nearly all of the accusations, saying it waged a legitimate counter-insurgency operation after coming under attack from Rohingya militants.

The charity Proactiva Open Arms operates in the sea between Libya and southern Europe in a mission aimed at aiding migrants who have found themselves in trouble during an attempt to cross the sea from northern Africa. 
The 87 people were rescued from an inflatable raft which was floating directionless with a broken motor in the open sea on August 2, Open Arms said.
Those saved included 84 from Sudan, one Syrian, one Egyptian and a Gambian. There were 12 children included in those saved, the group said.
""We came across the raft where the people were in a very bad state and very afraid that we were a Libyan boat and we planned to return them to Libya,"" Open Arms mission head Ricardo Gatti said during a news conference in Thursday. 
The charity says that migrants they have helped have said they fear if they were returned to Libya they could face imprisonment and torture and many have said they would rather die than be returned. 
In Spain, they will be processed before being granted refuge in Europe or they will be deported back to where they came from.
France will take in around 20 of the Open Arms passengers, a source in President Emmanuel Macron's Elysee palace said. A team from refugee office Ofpra will travel to Spain to identify those who will come to France, the source said. 
Irregular immigration across the Mediterranean has fallen dramatically, with about 60,000 people making it to Europe across the sea to date this year compared to over a million in 2015, but politically it has become ever more divisive.

According to the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration, Spain has seen arrivals jump to 23,741 to August this year compared to just 8,677 in the same period in 2017 as countries such as Italy clamp down on arrivals along its coast.

Idlib, at the Turkish border, is one of the last major rebel strongholds in Syria. President Bashar al-Assad, who has defeated rebels across much of Syria with Russian and Iranian help, has indicated it could be his next target.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said additional government forces were arriving for a possible attack in an area to the southwest of Idlib city that overlaps with Latakia and Hama provinces.
Syrians have fled to Idlib province from other parts of the country as the government has advanced, and the United Nations has warned that an offensive there could force 2.5 million people towards the Turkish border in the event of an offensive.
NATO member Turkey has warned against any offensive in Idlib, and is pressing Russia to make sure this doesn't happen. Turkey has established 12 military observation posts in the northwest under an agreement with Russia and Iran.
U.N. humanitarian adviser Jan Egeland said on Thursday that Russia, Turkey and Iran had said they would do their utmost to avoid a battle in Idlib. But he added that the U.N. was making preparations and that he would ask Turkey to keep its borders open for fleeing civilians.
""Your cooperation with the Syrian Arab Army will release you from the rule of militants and terrorists, and will preserve your and your families' lives,"" declared the leaflets that were dropped in rural areas near Idlib city.
""We call upon you to join local reconciliation (agreements) as many others in Syria have done,"" said the leaflet in the name of the army command, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.
Such agreements, concluded at the local level, have been a tool for helping the Syrian government to reestablish control over numerous areas and have often been agreed when rebel fighters are on the brink of military defeat.
The government says the agreements grant an amnesty to rebels who are willing to live under state rule again, unless private law suits have been brought against them. The terms also include that they give up weapons.
But many rebels, civilian dissidents and others have instead opted to take safe passage to the opposition-held northwest, an arc of territory at the Turkish border that stretches from Idlib to the city of Jarablus on the Euphrates River.
Idlib is controlled by an array of insurgent groups, but jihadists are widely assessed to be the dominant force there.

The Union of Orthodox Banner Bearers https://reut.rs/2OUVrWe is a small fringe group of Russian nationalists with no political power that stages processions, rallies and even burns books to promote their views.
Clad in all-black and marching with their Orthodox banners, the group pairs a biker club's aesthetic with the gold of religious icons.
""We are striving for the restoration of an autocratic monarchy. Like the one we had under our tsars,"" Leonid Simonovich-Nikshich, the group's white-bearded leader, said.
""It is only possible through the church. In no way is this possible in a political secular way because that would be a dictator,"" he said.
Its leaders say they are unsure how a shift to a monarchy might come about, with some members seeing the change emerging from a bloody social convulsion and others simply praying for it to happen. 
Ultra nationalist politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky has referred to Putin as a modern-day tsar, but the Orthodox group's political allegiances are unclear and it is not suggesting that the Russian president head an autocratic monarchy.    
The group held a religious procession at a monastery in Moscow last month to mark one of the most important recent dates in their calendar: the 100-year anniversary of the murder by the Bolsheviks of Russia's last monarch, Tsar Nicholas II. 
The tsar, his wife and five children were shot on the night of July 16-17, 1918, in the basement of a merchant's house in the city of Yekaterinburg, 1,450 km (900 miles) east of Moscow. 
After the collapse of the Soviet Union and the state atheism it espoused, the church canonized the tsar and his family, and his popularity as a historical figure has grown amid a Russian Orthodox Church resurgence under President Vladimir Putin.
Russian religious conservatives last year waged a campaign to block the release of Matilda, a Russian movie the Union of Orthodox Banner Bearers described as blasphemous for its depiction of a romance between the tsar and a young ballerina. 
The group did not attend the main memorial event in Yekaterinburg to mark the centenary of his murder however.
It was told it would not be allowed to raise its standards - some of which feature skulls and radical slogans like Orthodoxy or Death - at the event, Igor Miroshnichenko, a member of the group, said. 

Instead, the group gathered at the Andronikov Monastery of the Saviour in Moscow on July 17 where they marched with tall crosses and standards depicting Russia's last tsar.

The attack in Chinartu district last Friday underlined the ferocity of fighting in many areas of Afghanistan even as speculation has increased about a possible ceasefire during the Eid holiday later this month.
""We have discovered and transported 40 bodies from the area, so far,"" district governor Faiz Mohammad said, adding that a number of security forces were still missing.
News of the attack only began filtering out over the past two days. Muhammad Radmanish, a spokesman for the ministry of defense, said 27 Afghan soldiers were killed and five wounded.
The base was back under control of security forces, said Radmanish but the attack has caused significant damage and weapons losses.
Amir Muhammad Barekzai, a member of the provincial council, said some soldiers appear to have been shot after they were captured but it was not possible to obtain independent confirmation. No comment was immediately available from a Taliban spokesman. 
""By Wednesday evening, the bodies of 27 soldiers were discovered, but a number of others are still missing,"" Barekzai said.
The attack underlines the heavy losses still being suffered by security forces as they fight the Taliban insurgents. A report last year by SIGAR, a U.S. Congressional watchdog, said the losses were ""shockingly high"" but Afghan authorities no longer release overall casualty data.
The Taliban are fighting the Western-backed government to restore their version of sharia, or Islamic law, after they were driven out by U.S.-led forces in 2001.

A three-judge panel at the Court of Final Appeal did not grant Jutting leave for appeal, rejecting his laywer's argument that the trial judge had misdirected the jury over the defense of diminished responsibility, public broadcaster RTHK reported.
In a hearing that lasted less than an hour, judges Roberto Ribeiro, Robert Tang and Joseph Fok upheld the ruling of a lower appeal court and said the original trial judge had been consistent and fair, RTHK reported.
Jutting's lawyers had argued that the Jutting had been subjected to a ""substantial and grave injustice"" at the original trial, the South China Morning Post reported.
A member of Jutting's defense team, led by lawyer Gerard McCoy, confirmed that a request for an appeal, which represented Jutting's last chance for a retrial, had failed.
The initial trial gripped the global financial hub.
Evidence emerged that Jutting had filmed his torture of Ningsih on his mobile phone. He also recorded hours of footage in which he described the murders and his graphic sexual fantasies.
After slashing Ningsih's throat with a knife, he stuffed her body in a suitcase and left it on his balcony. He killed Mujiasih after she panicked when he brought her back to the flat several days later.
The jury in the original trial was unanimous in finding Jutting guilty.
Jutting is the grandson of a British policeman in Hong Kong and a Chinese woman.

The entire 11-person crew, all from Montenegro, was arrested for international drugs trafficking, Italy's finance police said in a statement. 
The research and survey vessel Remus left the Canary Islands bound for Egypt and Turkey, but police surveillance showed it had turned off its position transmitter near the coast of North Africa, raising investigators' suspicions.
With the permission of Panamanian authorities, Italian finance police seized the vessel in international waters on July 31 and escorted it to Palermo. There the fuel tanks were drained and the hash was discovered wrapped in sealed brown bags.
""The Mediterranean Sea again is confirmed to be one of the world's largest arteries for illegal trafficking,"" the police statement said. ""The results of the operation are the fruit of attentive intelligence gathering and analysis of the ship's routes."" 
The North African hashish -- compressed cannabis resin -- was probably destined for the European market, police said. Morocco is the world's largest producer of hashish, which is usually smuggled into Europe through Spain, according the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.

RAMALLAH/GAZA (Reuters) - From orderly rows of solar panels in a field in the West Bank to the chaotic rooftops of Gaza, Palestinians are hoping that harnessing the energy of the sun can reduce their dependence on Israel for electricity.
The West Bank only gets around three-quarters of the power its 3 million people need, imported mostly from Israel and, to a far lesser extent, Jordan. 
In the Gaza Strip, power generation is so paltry that, even with imports from Israel and Egypt, it gets just one-third of what it needs - so the 2 million Gazans struggle on with an average of just four hours of electricity a day.
Individuals have taken it on themselves to install solar panels, trailing cables down the side of buildings to keep fans whirring or to power televisions and other appliances.
The number of panels in the enclave has increased four-fold in four years and they are now dotted on most rooftops and balcony on homes, schools, hospitals, shops, banks and mosques in a place where the sun shines 320 days a year.
In Gaza's Nusseirat refugee camp, Sabreen Abu Shawiesh said installing solar panels on the metal roof of her one-floor house had changed her family's life: ""We almost had no electricity, nowadays fans are working all day.""
The sun may be free, but the technology is not, and Palestinians say their ability to import solar panels has been hampered by Israeli border controls.
In Gaza, which has endured years of Israeli and Egyptian sanctions aimed at isolating Islamist Hamas which rules the territory, tensions raised by weekly border protest since March 30 have increased the problem.
Israel has blocked all imports into the enclave except for humanitarian supplies.
Even before then, entrepreneurs in Gaza say they have sometimes been banned from importing various kinds of batteries - including those used for solar power - by Israel, on the grounds that they might be used for military purposes.
A spokesman for Israel's Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories said Israel had not imposed any import restrictions on solar panel technology and did not consider it to be ""dual purpose"".
""BASIC ELEMENTS""
In the West Bank, ruled by President Mahmoud Abbas’s Western-backed Palestinian Authority, the public and private sectors have launched projects to diversify power sources to get cheaper electricity and more self-sufficiency.
""The government is in dire need of individual initiatives and investments to provide power so that it can become independent of the occupation (Israel), step by step,"" Shifa' Abu Sa'adi, head of natural resources at the Palestinian economy ministry, told Reuters.
    The Authority’s Palestinian Investment Fund (PIF) plans to build three solar farms and put solar energy into 500 schools. The three new plants will generate 22 megawatts per day. The West Bank needs 1,400 megawatts but currently only 1,100 megawatts are available.
Larger solar projects would require more land but it is scarce because, under the Oslo peace accords of the mid-1990s, Israel retains control of much of the land of the West Bank.
""We will be in a good position if we reach 5 or 10 per cent of the required electricity supply for Palestine in general from solar energy,"" said Azem Bishara, chief executive officer of Massader, a subsidiary of the PIF.
Bishara said Massader intended to invest $200 million in renewable energy over the next six years to generate an additional 200 megawatts.
The Gaza Strip only has one power plant, which generated 140 megawatts in 1999 when it was built but now only produces 23 megawatts. The enclave imports 30 megawatts from Egypt and 120 from Israel. This is less than a third of the Strip’s daily needs - estimated at up to 600 megawatts a day.
Last week the European Union completed Gaza's biggest solar farm which will provide 0.5 megawatts per day to fuel the Southern Gaza Desalination Plant, also funded by the EU.
U.N. Deputy Special Coordinator for Middle East Peace Process Jamie McGoldrick this week urged Israel to allow U.N.-purchased emergency fuel needed for backup generators at vital health, water and sanitation operations.
""The well-being of 2 million people, half of whom are children, is at stake. It is unacceptable that Palestinians in Gaza are repeatedly deprived of the most basic elements of a dignified life,"" McGoldrick said.

Israel's Defence Ministry had no immediate comment.

In July the Polish parliament approved an altered election rule that favors big parties like PiS and the biggest opposition group Civic Platform (PO) and disadvantages smaller groups or individuals.
""I do not see a need of such a fundamental limitation of access to the European Parliament. In practice this eliminates smaller parties. I question this from the democratic point of view,"" Dziennik Gazeta Prawna quoted Andrzej Duda as saying in an interview. 
""I am strongly inclined to block this proposal.""
Duda is a PiS ally but his potential veto would mark another twist in his relations with the ruling party, which have been volatile since the president unexpectedly vetoed controversial bills intended to reform the court system a year ago.
Duda's first veto was interpreted as a sign of crisis in his relationship with PiS, but since then, despite strong objections at home and abroad, PiS has managed to complete the judicial overhaul and the deadlocked has eased.

Duda approved the most recent amendments to the law, which in effect let the government choose the next Supreme Court chief. Street protesters at that time held up pens during demonstrations against the amendment, referring to Duda's readiness to sign.

JUBA (Reuters) - President Salva Kiir granted a general amnesty to rebels in South Sudan's civil war, including his former deputy Riek Machar, as a rights organization said authorities in Africa's youngest country should also free its unarmed critics. 
The amnesty order was read out on state-run television late on Wednesday, three days after Kiir, SPLM-IO leader Machar and the heads of other groups signed a ceasefire and power-sharing agreement in the Sudanese capital Khartoum.
A political row between Kiir and Machar degenerated in 2013 into a war that has killed tens of thousands, forced a quarter of the population to flee their homes and wrecked the country's oil-dependent economy.
The conflict has often been fought along ethnic lines. Previous deals to end it have failed, including one in 2015 that briefly halted hostilities but fell apart after Machar returned to the capital Juba the following year.
SPLM-IO is the largest of the rebel groups fighting Kiir's government, and fighters allied to it control several areas close to the capital. Other anti-government groups have also emerged, some of which have fought against each other.
Lam Paul Gabriel, SPLM-IO's deputy military spokesman, said the amnesty will only be genuine once Kiir observes all the conditions agreed upon in the deal signed on Sunday.
""Machar can only come to Juba after the pre-interim period when the unified forces are deployed in Juba and other major towns in South Sudan,"" he said. 
Machar was freed this year from house arrest in South Africa where he had been held since fleeing South Sudan in 2016.
""It will now give Machar much confidence, including others (who are) estranged a genuine reason to return to the country without the fear of the replication of the 2016 incident,"" Majak Daniel, a Juba-based journalist, told Reuters.
Human Rights Watch called on Thursday for the release of a number of government critics jailed by the intelligence services, including Peter Biar Ajak, a prominent economist who has criticized both sides in the war.
""South Sudanese authorities should release everyone being held arbitrarily and change the way the national security agency operates,"" Jehanne Henry, associate Africa director at the New York-based rights organization said in a statement.
Biar, a country director for the London School of Economics' International Growth Centre and a former World Bank economist, was arrested by officers of the agency in July.

""A lot still is needed such as the cessation of hostilities and ending the war of words,"" said Samuel, a 32-year-old resident of Juba.

Wu Dehua, who worked in the southwestern city of Chongqing's Yubei district, had been expelled from the party and handed over to legal authorities after a probe found serious discipline violations, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said on its website.
Wu's transgressions included being ""obsessed with divination and fortune telling"" and trying to create his own ""fallacious and evil teachings"", the watchdog said. 
He was also accused of taking bribes, spreading political rumors, exchanging power for money and money for sex, and collecting ""reactionary magazines"". 
It did not give specifics on the magazines, but reactionary is a term that dates to the early days of Communist China that often refers to conservative or anti-Communist ideas.
It was not possible to reach Wu or a representative for comment and unclear if he had been allowed to retain a lawyer.
Chongqing has been ground zero for President Xi Jinping's war against graft, with two of its former party chiefs jailed for corruption.
China officially guarantees freedom of religion for major belief systems, but party members are meant to be atheists and are especially banned from participating in what China calls superstitious practices like visiting soothsayers.
However, Chinese people, especially the country's leaders, have a long tradition of putting their faith in soothsaying and geomancy, looking for answers in times of doubt, need and chaos.
The practice has grown more risky amid Xi's sweeping crackdown on deep-seated corruption.
In one of the most famous recent cases, China's powerful former security chief, Zhou Yongkang, was jailed for life in part due to accusations he leaked undisclosed state secrets to a fortune teller and healer called Cao Yongzheng, known as the ""Xinjiang sage"" after the far western region where he grew up.

Gill Boehringer, 84, a former law professor at Sydney's Macquarie University, was refused entry at Manila's airport late on Wednesday because he was on a blacklist for joining a demonstration in 2015. He said that was ""absolute nonsense"". 
A human rights group said his planned deportation was a sign of ""paranoia"" of President Rodrigo Duterte and his government.
Duterte has been condemned widely for alleged human rights abuses, mostly over a war on drugs that has killed thousands of people. Duterte denies any wrongdoing. 
Another elderly Australian, Patricia Fox, a nun, was last month declared an ""undesirable alien"" and ordered deported. She was accused of political activism in joining rallies on Duterte's home island of Mindanao against martial law and in support of indigenous people.
Duterte has said he ordered her expulsion. Fox has appealed against the decision.
Boehringer told Reuters he joined a fact-finding mission about indigenous people in Mindanao this year, but said the immigration bureau's accusation that he joined protests was ""trumped up"".
""This is part of the government's campaign to keep foreigners away from what they're doing ... the injustices, the killings, the disappearances,"" he said, without elaborating. 
Immigration spokeswoman Dana Krizia Sandoval said blacklisting meant being ""a threat to public order and safety"" and Boehringer could appeal the deportation. 
Human rights advocacy group Karapatan (Rights) said Boehringer's case showed the government was ""showing its cracks, defensive and scared"".

PEMENANG, Indonesia (Reuters) - A magnitude 6.2 aftershock rocked Indonesia's Lombok on Thursday, sparking fresh panic on the tropical tourist island after a series of tremors that have killed more than 150 people in the past two weeks.
Reuters witnesses reporting on the aftermath of last Sunday's quake in the north of the island said buildings and walls that had already been weakened collapsed, and people ran out onto roads even as rocks tumbled down from hillsides.
""Evacuees and people ran out of houses when they felt the strong shake of the 6.2 magnitude quake,"" Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency (BNPB), said on Twitter.
""People are still traumatized. Some buildings were damaged further because of this."" 
Officials said the epicenter of the aftershock was on land and so there was no risk of a tsunami.
The United States Geological Survey recorded the latest quake at 5.9, at a depth of 10 km (6 miles).
BNPB's official death toll from Sunday's 6.9 magnitude quake stood at 131, although some officials put the number at 347. Sutopo did not give an updated toll, telling Reuters only that there had been ""a big increase"".
A humanitarian crisis is also looming in Lombok, where thousands have been left homeless and in desperate need of clean water, food, medicine and shelter. 
Authorities made announcements over loudspeakers at evacuation sites after Thursday's quake, urging people to remain calm and stay inside tents or find open space if they were inside or near buildings.
""Please stay calm, this is just an aftershock and it will be over soon, there's no need to be scared,"" one official announced in a calm voice.
Officials said about three-quarters of Lombok's rural north had been without electricity since Sunday, although power had since been restored in most areas. Aid workers have found some hamlets hard to reach because bridges and roads were torn up by the disaster.
Ruslan, a 29-year-old resident of Pemenang on the northwestern shoulder of Lombok, said he had already been anxious about aftershocks before the latest jolt.
""My heart jumps if even the door slams hard. It's difficult to get used to,"" he said. 
""We are still scared to go into the house. At the most we go in quickly to grab something and then run back out.""
Thousands of tourists have left Lombok since Sunday, fearing further earthquakes, some on extra flights provided by airlines and others on ferries to the neighboring island of Bali.

Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes. In 2004, the Indian Ocean tsunami killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.

Four people were rescued. 
The boat sank off the coast of Aydin province, near Kusadasi, a popular tourist destination, it said.
In 2015, Turkey became one of the main launch points for more than a million migrants taking the sea route to the European Union, many fleeing conflict and poverty in the Middle East and Africa.
A 2016 deal between Turkey and the European Union sharply reduced the flow, after hundreds died crossing to Greek islands a few miles off the Turkish shore.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistani prime minister-in-waiting Imran Khan called for more ""trustworthy"" ties with the United States which have frayed amid U.S. accusations that Pakistan is aiding Islamist insurgents waging war in Afghanistan, something Islamabad denies. 
Khan, who is due to be sworn-in as premier next week after his July 25 election victory, met acting U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan John F. Hoover on Wednesday and said the ups and downs in relations had led to a ""trust deficit"".
Washington has suspended aid and military assistance to Pakistan. 
""(My party) wants to build a relationship with United States based on trust and mutual respect and hence our government will engage with U.S. to make this relationship more balanced and trustworthy,"" Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party said in a statement late on Wednesday, attributing comments to Khan.
Khan added that there was a need to ""transform"" the diplomatic ties between the two countries. The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan has not commented on the meeting.
In January, U.S President Donald Trump further strained relations with a withering attack on Pakistan on Twitter, accusing Pakistan of playing a ""double game"" on fighting terrorism and vowing a tougher approach.
In the same tweet he said the United States has been rewarded with ""nothing but lies and deceit"" for ""foolishly"" giving Pakistan more than $33 billion in aid in the past 15 years.
Last week, the United States angered Islamabad by raising the prospect of opposing any future International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout for Pakistan, which its economy badly needs, due to concerns the money would go towards paying off Chinese loans.
The United States is wary of the closer ties between Pakistan and China, which have deepened in recent years on the back of Beijing's pledge to fund $57 billion in infrastructure as part of its vast Belt and Road initiative.
Khan's party said the former cricketer also discussed Afghanistan with the U.S. envoy, stressing that a political solution was needed rather than more fighting.
""Stability in Afghanistan, he said, is (in) the larger interests of Pakistan, America and the region and hence should be earned through viable political engagements,"" said Khan, according to the PTI statement.

1562,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 03:45AM ET</span>","Russia calls new U.S. sanctions draconian, rejects poisoning allegations","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's embassy in the United States on Thursday called new U.S. sanctions draconian and said the reason for the new restrictions -- allegations it poisoned a former spy and his daughter in Britain -- were far-fetched.
The United States on Wednesday announced it would impose fresh sanctions on Russia after Washington determined Moscow had used a nerve agent against a former Russian double agent, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia, in Britain.
Russia has repeatedly denied responsibility for the attack, and Russia's embassy in Washington said in a statement that Washington's findings against it in the case were not backed by evidence.
""On August 8, 2018 our Deputy Chief of Mission was informed in the State Department of new 'draconian' sanctions against Russia for far-fetched accusations of using the 'Novichok' nerve agent against a UK citizen,"" the embassy said in a statement.
""We grew accustomed to not hearing any facts or evidence."" 
The U.S. announcement fueled already worsening investor sentiment about the possible effect of more U.S. sanctions on Russian assets and the rouble slid by over 1 percent on Thursday against the dollar, a day after falling toward its lowest level in nearly two years. 
The Russian embassy said Moscow continued to advocate for an open and transparent investigation into the poisoning.
Sergei Skripal, a former colonel in Russia's GRU military intelligence service, and his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia, were found slumped unconscious on a bench in the southern English city of Salisbury in March after a liquid form of the Novichok type of nerve agent was applied to his home's front door.
European countries and the United States expelled 100 Russian diplomats after the attack, in the strongest action by President Donald Trump against Russia since he came to office.
The new U.S. sanctions would cover sensitive national-security controlled goods, a senior State Department official told reporters. 
There would, however, be exemptions for space flight activities, government space cooperation, and areas covering commercial passenger aviation safety, which would be reviewed on a case by case basis, the official added.
The official said a second batch of ""more draconian"" sanctions would be imposed after 90 days unless Russia gave ""reliable assurances"" it would no longer use chemical weapons and allow on-site inspections by the United Nations or other international observer groups.

Given that Russia flatly denies involvement in the incident, it appears unlikely to accede to the U.S. demands.

Wirapol Sukphol, who was seen in a YouTube video in 2013 holding wads of cash on a private jet, returned to Thailand in July 2017 after being extradited from the United States where he had fled.
Wirapol, formerly known by his monastic name Luang Pu Nenkham, was expelled from the monkhood in 2013 after the video surfaced. He was accused of having sexual intercourse - a grave offense for monks - with an underage girl, among other charges. 
He later fled to the United States.
A criminal court in Bangkok sentenced Wirapol to 114 years in prison though he will only serve 20 years because Thai law stipulates that is the maximum for someone found guilty of multiple counts of the same offense.
""He committed fraud by claiming to have special power to lure in people and he also bought many luxury cars which is considered a money-laundering offense,"" an official at the Department of Special Litigation told Reuters. 
The official declined to be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the media.
""The court found him guilty of multiple offences which resulted in a 114-year jail term when combined, which means he will actually serve 20 years in jail,"" he said.
Neither Wirapol nor his lawyer were available for comment. 
Wirapol faces separate charges of child molestation and child abduction. A verdict in that case is expected in October.
Wirapol's high-profile case highlighted a series of sex and money scandals that have rocked Thailand's Buddhist clergy in recent years, resulting in calls for reforms of religious institutions.

The military government that came to power after a 2014 coup has stepped up efforts to clean up Buddhism by arresting monks involved in corruption scandals and through the introduction of a bill that reduces the influence of Buddhism's Sangha Supreme Council - the governing body of Buddhist monks.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentine senators rejected a bill to legalize abortion after an impassioned debate ran into the early hours of Thursday, pushing back against a groundswell of support from a surging abortion rights movement.
The Senate voted 38 to 31 against the proposed measure, which would have legalized a woman's right to seek an abortion into the 14th week of pregnancy. The bill had narrowly passed in the lower house in July. 
Families and clergy in baby-blue bandanas gathered outside the congressional palace as the result came in just before 3 a.m., waving Argentine flags in support of the Catholic Church's anti-abortion stance in Pope Francis' home country.
""What this vote showed is that Argentina is still a country that represents family values,"" anti-abortion activist Victoria Osuna, 32, told Reuters.
Current Argentine law only permits abortions in cases of rape, or if the mother's health is at risk.
Abortion rights supporters, clad in green bandanas that have become a symbol of the movement, danced to drum lines and swarmed the city’s streets to the end, despite a biting wind and cold rain.
Many had camped in front of Argentina's National Congress since Wednesday night.
""I’m still optimistic. It didn’t pass today, but it will pass tomorrow, it will pass the next day,"" said abortion rights supporter Natalia Carol, 23. ""This is not over.""
Uruguay and Cuba are the only Latin American countries that now have broadly legalized abortion. 
In Brazil, the Supreme Court is set to consider whether current law, which allows terminating pregnancies only in cases of rape, fetal deformation or when the mother’s life is in danger, is unconstitutional.
But passing a pro-abortion law will face hurdles in Brazil's increasingly conservative Congress, with a growing Evangelical Christian caucus that is staunchly opposed.
Women's rights advocates, however, hope that a more liberal judiciary in Brazil will at least decriminalize abortion to help avoid deaths from botched terminations in a country where hundreds of thousands of women resort to clandestine clinics each year.
Ahead of the Senate vote in Argentina, President Mauricio Macri called the debate ""a win for democracy."" Macri said he was personally against abortion, but would sign the bill if it passed.
Argentina's abortion rights movement, backed by feminist groups galvanized in recent years to stop violence against women, argued that the bill would end unregulated abortions that government data show as the leading cause of maternal deaths.
There are at least 350,000 illegal abortions in Argentina every year, the Ministry of Health estimates, though international human rights groups say the number may be higher.
The move to legalize abortion in Argentina is a ""public health and human rights imperative,"" said New York-based Human Rights Watch.

""Just because the bill got shot down, it will not stop the movement,"" said Paula Avila-Guillen, a director of Women's Equality Center, an abortion rights advocacy group. ""We will be there at the next legislative opportunity.""

SEOUL/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told North Korea's foreign minister that the United States cannot be trusted, Tehran's state media said, as the United States seeks a deal to rein in the North's nuclear and missile programs. 
Iran dismissed a last-minute offer from Washington for talks this week, saying it could not negotiate after the Trump administration reneged on a 2015 deal to lift sanctions in return for curbs on Iran's own nuclear program.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, visited Iran as the United States reintroduced sanctions against the Islamic Republic. 
""The U.S. administration performance in these years has led the country to be considered untrustworthy and unreliable around the world which does not meet any of its obligations,"" Rouhani was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) as telling Ri on Wednesday.
""In the current situation, friendly countries should develop their relations and cooperation in (the) international community,"" he said, adding Iran and North Korea have ""always had close views"" on many issues. 
Ri traveled to Tehran after attending a security forum in Singapore, where he and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sparred over an agreement made at June's landmark summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. 
The two sides vowed to work toward North Korea's denuclearization at the summit, but have since struggled to reach a deal to meet that goal. North Korea has been pursuing its weapons programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions and sanctions.
Ri told Rouhani that Washington's pullout from the 2015 pact and restoration of sanctions was an ""action against international rules and regulations"", IRNA said. 
""North Korea's strategic policy is to deepen relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran and confront unilateralism,"" he said. 
Trump decided to restore sanctions against Iran despite pleas from other world powers that had co-sponsored the deal, including Washington's main European allies, Britain, France and Germany, as well as Russia and China.
The sanctions have already led banks and many companies around the world to scale back dealings with Iran. Companies doing business with Iran will be barred from the United States, Trump said on Tuesday.
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in Iran, said the country had nothing to be concerned about, his official website said on Wednesday.
""With regard to our situation do not be worried at all. Nobody can do anything,"" Khamenei said, the website reported.

The group, formerly called the ""National Technology and Education leadership Group"" under the state Cabinet, has been renamed without the mention of education to reflect a focus on technology, according to a circular published on the government's website on Wednesday.
The circular said the change was due to ""relevant arrangements"" as required by work, without elaborating. Premier Li Keqiang, who had chaired the original group since 2013, will lead the renamed body with vice premier Liu He as deputy.

The strategy, unveiled by China's State Council in 2015, is at the core of China's efforts to move up the value chain and achieve President Xi Jinping's vision of turning the country into a global superpower by 2050. 
However, foreign business groups have criticized the program as large-scale import substitution.
Under the plan, Beijing wants Chinese suppliers to capture 70 percent of market share by 2025 for ""basic core components and important basic materials"" in strategic industries. 
Other members of the revamped leadership group include top officials from more than a dozen ministries and key central government bodies, including central bank head Yi Gang and State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission director Xiao Yaqing.
It was unclear how the member composition was different because the state Cabinet did not publish the notice announcing the former group's members on its official website (www.gov.cn).

The State Council Information Office did not answer repeated phone calls seeking comment.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Masked police officers pointed semi-automatic rifles from a helicopter that flew low over Mexico City last week as security forces employ unprecedented heavy-handed tactics to combat a rise in levels of drug violence rarely seen in the capital.  
In a sight more familiar to Mexico's most dangerous border cities, goggled and masked officers hung from open doors, surveying the streets, their weapons trained on the ground 250 meters (820 ft) below.
When homicides, kidnapping and extortion soared across the country over the past decade as cartels battled security forces, Mexico City kept a lid on the worst crime and prospered, earning fame as a trendy getaway for foreign tourists.
For several years, murders in the capital actually declined. Now though, killings are at a record –up 45 percent since 2014. The city is on track for another record this year.
Although still well below the national average, and comparable to some U.S. cities, the violence in Mexico City is further denting the image of a country whose top resorts of Cancun and Los Cabos have seen gory murders and shootouts soar over the past year.
Just in recent days, Mexico City crime pages reported a man whose body was found in a car, his head on the roof, and another whose limbs were found in an ice box. Earlier this year, an American tourist was killed by a stray bullet at an upscale taco joint. 
Police say much of the crime stems from retail drug dealing from violent local gangs, although authorities say at least one of these has links to the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, a major national trafficking group.
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to bring peace to the country during his six year term and on Tuesday launched consultations with victims about a possible amnesty law for low-level crimes.
Saying it wants the city to be in a better state when it hands over to new mayor and ally of Lopez Obrador in December, the capital's interim government is now trying to take back streets where open drug dealing and robbery are common. 
Starting in July, a new police chief, Raymundo Collins, dispatched a fleet of ten helicopters to criss-cross the city every day, moving low and slow across high-crime neighborhoods for surveillance and in an attempt to intimidate criminals.
The strategy of high-profile policing may not last beyond December but it is a startling reminder to residents of the creeping drug violence in a sprawling city that would rather be known as one of Latin America's top spots for art, culture and business.     
Collins' office says police had doubled the average daily arrests of drug dealers in his first couple of weeks on the job.
""We're raising the cost of being a criminal,"" he said in an interview. ""Haven't you heard that people say I'm very tough?""
However, critics say helicopters may help some feel safe, but were unlikely to lower crime in the medium-term.
David Shirk, Professor of International Relations at the University of San Diego, who studies Mexican criminal justice, believes major cartels were beginning to fight for the capital. 
That's ""something we have not really seen before"" in Mexico City, Shirk said.
""I'm worried that once it starts, it escalates."" 
    
CORRUPTION
More than 90 percent of residents in the north, south and east of the capital report feeling unsafe. Less than 10 percent of crime is reported, statistics body INEGI estimates.    
The next mayor, Claudia Sheinbaum, said she doubted Collins' methods and vowed to replace him when she takes office in four months.
Corruption flourished in the police force in recent years, Sheinbaum said in an interview, distracting officers who she said sometimes paid superiors to get jobs and were charged for uniforms and bullets.
""The first thing is to take back control."" 
Sheinbaum said a U.S.-style justice reform was badly implemented, meaning fewer people are entering prisons, in part due to errors by undertrained police and prosecutors.
""The prosecutors office has to be modernized, it has to care for victims properly,"" she said.
Aggravating the problems, officials and experts say, are more guns on the streets. Collins blames the reform, which made pre-trial detention less common for gun possession.
Though gun purchases are restricted, black market weapons are available, often smuggled from the United States. Robbery and gun wounds have risen, according to government data. 

""Everyone has guns, even really young guys,"" Collins said. ""There didn't used to be so many guns in Mexico, it was a serious crime.""

(Reuters) - A California court on Wednesday rejected an appeal by a former Stanford University swimmer who was found guilty of sexual assault and served a sentence that many say was too lenient. 
Brock Turner, then 19, was arrested in 2015 after two fellow students at the Northern California university saw him outside a fraternity house on top of an unconscious woman. 
He was convicted of sexual assault the following year and sentenced to six months, a sentence criticized as too lenient by political leaders, residents and social media users.
Turner was released early for good behavior after serving three months. He had to register as a sex offender in his home state of Ohio, after leaving Stanford.
In December, Turner appealed, asking for the conviction to be overturned or a new trial, based on a lack of sufficient evidence.
The Sixth District Court of Appeal in California ruled that the ""argument lacks merit"" and that there was ""substantial evidence"" to convict Turner, a court document showed. 
The sentence Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky gave Turner stoked intense debate about rape on U.S. college campuses. Voters recalled Persky in June because of the sentence. 

In response to the Turner case, California lawmakers passed legislation to broaden the state's legal definition of rape and mandate prison if the victim was unconscious.

The maximum age for enlisted personnel and non-commissioned officer applicants will be raised to 32 from 26 from Oct. 1 to secure ""a stable supply of Self-Defense Forces (military) personnel amid a declining pool of recruits due to the recently declining birth rate"", the defense ministry said on Wednesday. 
The number of Japanese people aged between 18 and 26 years old - the current age band for recruits - is forecast to fall below eight million by 2046 from 11 million this year and a peak of 17 million in 1994.
The declining numbers, along with competition from the private sector due to a labor shortage, mean the SDF has been unable to fulfill recruitment quotas for the past five years, with the navy facing an especially tough time.
""Due to the declining birthrate and greater advancement into higher education, the environment of recruiting SDF personnel is increasingly severe,"" the ministry said in its 2017 white paper, echoing a lament heard for several years running.
The personnel pinch coincides with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's push to bolster Japan's military capabilities and seek a greater global security role.
The military is also trying to lure more women to its ranks to make up for the dearth of male recruits and aims to increase the percentage of women to nine percent from six percent by 2030.
Japan's fertility rate, the average number of children a woman bears during her lifetime, fell to 1.43 in 2017, above the record low of 1.26 hit in 2005 but far below the 2.1 needed for a stable population.

The 12 boys and their 25-year-old coach, Ekapol Chanthawong, from the ""Wild Boars"" soccer team were catapulted into the international spotlight after they became trapped inside the Tham Luang Cave in the northern province of Chiang Rai.
A dramatic, international rescue effort ended on July 10 when they were all brought out safely after an ordeal lasting more than two weeks.
The rescue highlighted the plight of Thailand's ""stateless"" people, who are often denied rights and opportunities because they are not citizens. Three of the boys and coach Ekapol were considered stateless, even though they were born in Thailand.
The four were granted citizenship on Wednesday.
""By providing these boys and their coach with citizenship, Thailand has given them the chance to both dream of a brighter future and to reach their full potential,"" Carol Batchelor, UNHCR's Special Advisor on Statelessness, said in a statement.
""By granting them citizenship, Thailand has provided them with a formal identity that will pave the way for them to achieve their aspirations,"" she said.
Many of Thailand's stateless are part of ""hill tribes"" living in remote border areas where they have limited access to information, including on how to apply for citizenship.

The 12 rescued boys returned to school this week after all but one of them spent nine days in a Buddhist monastery, a tradition for Thai males who experience adversity.

Venezuela's hyperinflation and chronic product shortages have fueled an exodus of citizens who typically travel by land via Colombia, often continuing south toward Andean nations including Ecuador, Peru and Chile.
""The government of Ecuador has declared a state of emergency related to human migration in the provinces of Carchi, Pichincha and El Oro to provide urgent attention to the Venezuelan migrants on the northern border,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement.
It added that Ecuador this week began receiving 4,200 Venezuelan migrants arriving each day. It did not say how many had been arriving before or why the numbers had increased.
The state of emergency, which will last for the month of August, is meant to speed up the deployment of doctors and social workers to attend to the migrants' needs, as well as police to provide support for immigration proceedings.
The statement added agencies including the International Organization for Migration and the U.N. Refugee Agency, UNHCR, would also help in the effort.

CUCUTA, Colombia (Reuters) - The United States will give Colombia $9 million to help provide for hundreds of thousands of refugees from Venezuela fleeing a severe economic and political crisis over the past 18 months, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Wednesday.
""We really have to question how long can this be sustainable,"" said Haley, who was in Colombia for Tuesday's inauguration of Colombian President Ivan Duque. 
Speaking in northern Cucuta, which borders Venezuela, Haley said the funds would go toward water sanitation, health needs, sterilization and medicines and ""things like that to really help the Venezuelan people.""
Most migrants cross into Colombia with only the possessions they can carry. Many are underfed and in need of medical care.
""At some point Maduro is gonna have to be dealt with,"" Haley said, referring to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. 
Venezuela's Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Haley has long been critical of Venezuela at the United Nations, requesting a closed door Security Council meeting in May last year and then holding an informal public council meeting in November, which was boycotted by Russia, China, Egypt and Bolivia.
Any U.S. push for U.N. Security Council action against Venezuela would likely be blocked by Russia and China.
U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed economic sanctions on Maduro and members of his cabinet after accusing them of undermining democracy and violating human rights.
With the new aid, the United States has donated $46 million in Latin America since fiscal 2017 to confront the Venezuela crisis, according to the United States Agency for International Development.
""This is a crisis where the region has not been as loud and active as we would like to see,"" Haley said. ""The world in general needs to realize that we have a dictator in Venezuela that is doing everything to protect himself and sacrificing all of the Venezuelan people to do it.""
During a visit to a soup kitchen for migrants, Haley spoke with Gabriela Gil, 25, who fled to Colombia from Venezuela with her husband and baby.
""We came with nothing,"" Gil said. ""We're happy she's here to see what it's like for us.""
In one of his final acts in office, former Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos last week gave more than 400,000 Venezuelans permission to stay in the country for up to two years. The migrants will have access to certain social services like public healthcare.
Colombia, whose relations with Maduro are often frigid, has accepted the bulk of migrants from Venezuela, and 200,000 Colombians who had been living in Venezuela have returned home, according to Colombian figures.

Maduro this weekend accused Santos of orchestrating a failed assassination attempt against him using drones. Santos dismissed the accusation, saying he was occupied with something more important - the baptism of his granddaughter Celeste.

President Ivan Duque took office on Tuesday and was informed a few days ago of Santos' decision, which was detailed in an Aug. 3 letter to the Palestinian representative in Colombia, the foreign ministry said.
""Given possible omissions that could come to light about the way in which this decision was taken by the outgoing president, the government will cautiously examine its implications and will act according to international law,"" new Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes said in a statement.
Santos decided to recognize Palestine as a ""free, independent and sovereign state,"" according to the letter, which was circulated to reporters by the foreign ministry.
""Just as the Palestinian people have a right to constitute an independent state, Israel has a right to live in peace alongside its neighbors,"" the letter said. 
The Israeli embassy in Bogota said it was surprised and disappointed. 
""We ask the Colombian government to reverse the decision made by the previous administration in its last days, which contravenes the close relations, extensive cooperation in vital areas and interests of both countries,"" it said in a statement posted to its Twitter account.
The decision came to light during a visit to Colombia by United States ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley. She attended Duque's inauguration on Tuesday and on Wednesday visited Venezuelan migrants in the northern border city of Cucuta.
The United States, a close ally of Israel, was getting more information about the situation and had no immediate comment, the U.S. mission to the United Nations said.
""We thank the Colombian government for this decision and we are sure that it will contribute significantly to generating the necessary conditions in the search for peace in the Middle East,"" the Palestine representative said in a statement on Wednesday.
Palestine has been recognized as a sovereign state by the U.N. General Assembly, the International Criminal Court and at least 136 countries.
Palestine seeks to create a state in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, lands that Israel captured in the 1967 war.

Colombia abstained in December from a vote by the 193-member U.N. General Assembly on a resolution calling for the United States to drop its recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. U.S. President Donald Trump had threatened to cut off financial aid to countries that voted in favor.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian prosecutors have formally charged  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co's chief executive for Latin America for alleged involvement in a healthcare cartel, officials said on Wednesday, though a judge ruled that he should be released from jail for now.
Daurio Speranzini Jr. was one of 24 people arrested a month ago as part of an investigation into fraud in medical equipment tenders overseen by health authorities in the state of Rio de Janeiro.
The crimes investigated occurred from 2004 to 2010 when Speranzini was head of Philips Medical Systems in Brazil, prosecutors said, and continued until 2015 while he had various positions in GE's healthcare unit. 
In previous documents, prosecutors argued that GE was part of a group of companies that funneled bribes through a politically connected local medical supply firm. The documents said Speranzini was fired from Philips after a whistleblower told Philips' compliance office about the scheme.
Two months after being fired, he was hired by GE Healthcare, taking on a succession of jobs and eventually becoming GE's Latin America head.
""The criminal scheme involved the participation of dozens of companies that, via a cartel, defrauded decades of tender processes,"" prosecutors said in documents filed with the court on Wednesday.
Also on Wednesday, Speranzini was freed from jail after a Supreme Court minister opted to apply measures such as restricting his contact with others under investigation, instead of keeping him incarcerated.
Reuters was unable to locate a lawyer for Speranzini for comment. 
In a statement, Philips said it was committed to following Brazilian rules and regulations, and that any investigation would be treated ""very seriously.""
GE defended its business practices and said it was committed to cooperating with authorities. It added that Speranzini remained suspended during the investigation, and that the probe would not affect service to clients or relationships with partners.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan warned on Wednesday that a severe financial shortfall facing a United Nations agency that helps Palestinian refugees could have a ""catastrophic"" impact on the lives of millions of refugees in the region.
Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said after meeting visiting U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) Commissioner-General Pierre Krähenbühl the budget crisis facing the agency could deprive refugees of core education, healthcare and food security service that would only ""deepen their humanitarian plight"".
""UNRWA faces a dangerous financial deficit that threatens catastrophic consequences on refugees if it is not covered before its financial allocations run out,"" Safadi was quoted as saying in a foreign ministry statement.
UNRWA has faced a cash crisis since the United States, long its biggest donor, slashed funding to the agency, providing just $60 million of a promised $365 million this year.
U.S. President Donald Trump withheld the aid after questioning its value and saying Washington would only provide more assistance if the Palestinians agreed to renew peace talks with Israel.
The largest ever reduction in UNRWA's funding has cast doubts about the agency's' long term outlook and has already begun to impact some services. U.N. officials have said it could even affect the opening of schools at the start of the next academic year.
The agency operates around 700 schools, educating 500,000 refugee children in Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan.
Jordan, which hosts the largest number of Palestinian refugees in the Middle East outside Palestinian territories, was engaged in intensive lobbying with donors, Safadi said.
Officials privately have said they were was also worried about any U.S. drive to dismantle the agency as part of a nascent Middle East peace plan that Washington has promised to unveil soon
According to diplomats, the plan diverges from longstanding U.S. support for a Palestinian state and backing for a full Israeli withdrawal from territory captured in 1967.
""Jordan warns of the danger of touching the role of the UNRWA that should continue to provide its services under its international mandate,"" the foreign ministry statement said.
Safadi said the international community must continue to shoulder its political and moral responsibilities toward Palestinian refugees under U.N. Security Council resolutions that maintain their right of return and compensation.
Among several disputes deadlocking Middle East peace talks has been a demand that as many as 5 million Palestinians be granted the right to return to lands in Israel that they or their kin lost

Founded in 1949, UNRWA serves Palestinian refugees in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, in Gaza, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan. It is funded mainly by voluntary contributions from U.N. member states.

MONTREAL/RIYADH (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday said he would keep pressing Saudi Arabia on civil liberties amid a major diplomatic dispute but also offered an apparent olive branch, saying the kingdom had made some progress on human rights.
Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir - infuriated by Canada's demand last week that jailed rights activists be released immediately - said earlier on Wednesday that there was no room for mediation, adding that Ottawa knew what it needed to do to ""fix its big mistake.""
Riyadh on Sunday froze new trade with Canada and expelled the Canadian ambassador. It also ended state-backed educational and medical programs in Canada.
Trudeau - who referred to the matter as ""a diplomatic difference of opinion"" - told reporters in Montreal that Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland had held a long conversation with her Saudi counterpart on Tuesday, but gave no details.
""Diplomatic talks continue ... we don't want to have poor relations with Saudi Arabia. It is a country that has great significance in the world, that is making progress in the area of human rights,"" he said.
""But we will continue underscoring challenges where and when they exist, in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere,"" he continued.
On Friday, Canada expressed concern over the arrests of activists in Saudi Arabia, including prominent women's rights campaigner Samar Badawi.
Her brother Raif Badawi, a prominent blogger, is serving a 10-year sentence and has been publicly flogged for expressing dissenting opinions online. His wife and children live in Canada and are Canadian citizens.
A number of women's rights activists, who campaigned for the right to drive and an end to the kingdom's male guardianship system, have been targeted in a government crackdown in recent months, human rights' groups say.
Jubeir said the kingdom was still ""considering additional measures"" against Canada, but did not elaborate. Canadian investments in Saudi Arabia were still ongoing and would not be affected by the dispute, he said.
The Financial Times, citing unidentified sources, reported that the Saudi central bank and state pension funds had instructed their overseas asset managers to dispose of their Canadian equities, bonds and cash holdings ""no matter the cost"".
The central bank did not immediately respond to a Reuters query for comment. Canada's foreign ministry said it was seeking clarity from the Saudi Arabian government.
A source at a Saudi bank told Reuters it was contacted by the central bank on Wednesday asking for information about all its Canadian exposure – investments in Canada and foreign exchange positions. 
THREAT TO INVESTMENT?
Since rising to power in 2015, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has courted Western allies to support his reform plans, offering billions of dollars of arms sales and promising to fight radicalism in the kingdom. 
But the row threatens to slow Riyadh's foreign investment drive, a campaign already unsettled by a series of assertive foreign policy initiatives by the top oil exporter.
""Saudi Arabia simply cannot afford to alienate any other sections of the global community in the midst of its unpopular military engagement in Yemen, its indirect confrontation with Iran,"" commentator Jamal Khashoggi wrote in the Washington Post.
In addition to the trade freeze, Riyadh has stopped sending patients to Canadian hospitals and told hundreds of trainee doctors to leave Canada with only weeks' notice.
That could disrupt Canadian hospitals and end a 40-year-old program to train specialists for the kingdom.
Saudi authorities also suspended educational exchanges, and moved Saudi scholars to other countries. Saudi's state airline said it was suspending flights to and from Toronto. 
Saudi Arabia's main state wheat-buying agency told grains exporters it will no longer accept Canadian-origin grains in international tenders, European traders said.
Bilateral trade between Canada and Saudi Arabia is worth nearly $4 billion a year. Canadian exports to Saudi Arabia were about $1.12 billion in 2017, or 0.2 percent of the total value of Canadian exports.

On Tuesday, Reuters reported that Canada planned to seek help from United Arab Emirates and Britain to defuse the row.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Washington said on Wednesday it would impose fresh sanctions on Russia by the end of August after it determined that Moscow had used a nerve agent against a former Russian agent and his daughter in Britain.
A senior State Department official said it had notified the Kremlin of the sanctions earlier in the day.
Sergei Skripal, a former colonel in Russia's GRU military intelligence service, and his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia, were found slumped unconscious on a bench in the southern English city of Salisbury in March after a liquid form of the Novichok type of nerve agent was applied to his home's front door.
European countries and the United States expelled 100 Russian diplomats after the attack, in the strongest action by President Donald Trump against Russia since he came to office.
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said it had been determined that Russia ""has used chemical or biological weapons in violation of international law, or has used lethal chemical or biological weapons against its own nationals.""
The sanctions would cover sensitive national-security controlled goods, a senior State Department official told reporters on a conference call, citing the 1991 Chemical and Biological Weapons and Warfare Elimination Act.
There would, however, be exemptions for space flight activities, government space cooperation, and areas covering commercial passenger aviation safety, which would be reviewed on a case by case basis, the official added.
""It is possible that trade affected could potentially reach hundreds of millions of dollars,"" the official added. ""It's up to Russia how dramatic the impact is.""
The official said a second batch of ""more draconian"" sanctions would be imposed after 90 days unless Russia gives ""reliable assurances"" that it will no longer use chemical weapons and allow on-site inspections by the United Nations or other international observer groups.
""If those criteria are not met - it is up to Russia to make that decision - a second round of sanctions ...will to be imposed,"" the official said, ""They are in general more draconian than the first round.""
A British government spokesman welcomed Washington's announcement, saying: ""The strong international response to the use of a chemical weapon on the streets of Salisbury sends an unequivocal message to Russia that its provocative, reckless behavior will not go unchallenged.""

The news came as Republican U.S. Senator Rand Paul said on Wednesday he had delivered a letter from President Donald Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin proposing cooperation.

Senator Ana Amelia Lemos said Brazil should have leveraged its neutral stance regarding a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy in Britain to get Russia to lift a ban on Brazilian pork and beef, for example.
""That's commercial pragmatism,"" Lemos, a former journalist from farm state Rio Grande do Sul, said in an interview. ""While others were slapping sanctions on Russia, we should have grabbed the moment to ask them to open the door to Brazilian meat.""
Alckmin confirmed Lemos as his vice-presidential candidate over the weekend, appealing to undecided women voters and Brazil's booming farm sector, which she has long championed.
Lemos said Brazil should also seek better trade terms from China, refusing to be pushed around by its biggest trade partner. In June, China put anti-dumping measures on Brazilian chicken imports, driving down shares of BRF SA, the world's biggest poultry exporter.
She recalled an ""unacceptable"" incident in 2004 when China rejected several shipments of soybeans, saying they were contaminated. ""It was clearly a speculative maneuver to reduce prices,"" Lemos said.
She said Alckmin's government would build infrastructure that Brazilian farmers need to get their products to market at competitive prices.
She said it would also back easing gun control laws so farmers can protect themselves from rising crime in rural Brazil, a central plank in the platform of far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro, the current front-runner for the Oct. 7 vote.
Alckmin, a centrist reformer, will not waver in curbing spending to bring down Brazil's huge fiscal deficit, she said, adding that raising taxes was out of the question.

A four-time governor of Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest state, Alckmin has begun to rise in the polls after stitching together a nine-party coalition with ample campaign resources. A survey by pollster MDA in the state of Sao Paulo released on Wednesday showed him within striking distance of Bolsonaro for the first time.

Jonik Abrahamyan was a member of parliament several times in the past and belongs to a wealthy and influential family, which owns several businesses in the former Soviet country of 3.2 million people.
The arrest is one in a series under Armenia's new prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, a former opposition leader, who was elected in May after weeks of mass protests against corruption and cronyism.
The National Security Service said in a statement it had found weapons on the property of a former mechanical plant believed to have belonged to Hovik Abrahamyan, who served as prime minister from 2014 to 2016.
An Armenian court ordered former President Robert Kocharyan, who served from 1998 to 2008, detained last month on charges of usurping power and an attempt to overthrow the constitutional order during events after the 2008 elections when his ally Serzh Sarksyan became the next president.
Kocharyan has dismissed the charges as politically motivated.
A month earlier the Armenian parliament stripped general Manvel Grigoryan from the former ruling party of immunity. The parliament supported a prosecutor's motion to open criminal proceedings against him after the National Security Service confiscated weapons and ammunition from his home.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has chosen former Chilean President Michelle Bachelet to be the world body's new human rights chief, the United Nations said on Wednesday.
The 193-member U.N. General Assembly is due to meet on Friday to approve Bachelet's appointment. She would replace Jordan's outspoken Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, who is stepping down at the end of the month after a four-year term in the Geneva-based job.
Ambassadors chairing different regional groups at the United Nations were told of the decision on Tuesday by U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed, several diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters earlier on Wednesday. 
U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said in a statement that Guterres formally notified the General Assembly on Wednesday.
Bachelet, a victim of torture under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, was conservative Chile's first female leader. 
The pediatrician-turned-politician first served as president of Chile from 2006 to 2010. Her amiable style, welfare policies and steady economic growth in one of the region's most developed countries made her popular.
Bachelet then led U.N. Women, a body for gender equality and the empowerment of women, between 2010 and 2013, before returning to Chile where she again served as president from 2014 to 2018, pushing for a more radical tax-and-spend agenda, as well as broader abortion rights and gay marriage.
Zeid told reporters in New York earlier this month that he did not seek a second term because he did not believe he would have the support of key world powers, including the United States, China and Russia.
Zeid has been strongly critical of some of U.S. President Donald Trump's policies and his attacks on the media. 
""Someone said to me 'just come out swinging' and that's what I did,"" Zeid said of advice he was given when he started the job in 2014. ""Silence does not earn you any respect.""
""We do not bring shame on governments, they shame themselves,"" he said.
Zeid said the pressure of the human rights job was intense. After a tough week last year, his wife recommended he watch feel-good reality television show ""The Great British Bake Off"" to take his mind off human rights abuses.

""This man pulls out a soufflé just before the competition ends and the thing collapses,"" he said. ""I burst into tears and I couldn't stop.""

BEIT UR AL-FAUQA, West Bank (Reuters) - Sharing smiles and hugs, the extended family of Rashida Tlaib, who is set to become the first Muslim woman to join the U.S. Congress, celebrated her election victory on Wednesday in the courtyard of their West Bank house.
Tlaib's grandmother, aunts and uncles welcomed neighbors in the village of Beit Ur al-Fauqa in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, who gathered near their single-story stone house beside a grove of olive trees to congratulate them on the historic win.
""This makes us proud - as the Tlaib family, residents of Beit Ur, as Palestinians, as Arabs and as Muslims, that a simple girl reaches such a position,"" said her uncle, Bassam Tlaib.
Tlaib's family said the soon-to-be Congresswoman held her wedding in Beit Ur al-Fauqa in 1997 and last visited the village in 2006.
The oldest of 14 children born to a family of Palestinian immigrants, Tlaib is a Detroit native. Her father worked at a Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) plant in the city, home of the U.S. car industry, and she became the first Muslim woman elected to the state legislature.
On Tuesday she won her district's Democratic nomination for Michigan's 13th Congressional district, encompassing parts of Detroit and surrounding suburbs and home to one of the largest Muslim and Arab-American populations in the United States.
Since no one ran in the Republican primary, Tlaib is poised to win the seat.
The West Bank is occupied by Israel which captured it in a 1967 Middle East war. The Western-backed Palestinian Authority has limited self-rule in the territory which is home to around 3 million stateless Palestinians. Israel maintains a military presence with checkpoints on major roads to protect 400,000 Jewish settlers.

1582,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>",Afghanistan says surrendered Islamic State fighters are war prisoners: U.S. general,"By Phil Stewart
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Afghanistan told the United States that Islamic State fighters who surrendered last week will be treated as prisoners of war, and not honored guests, despite the warm welcome they had initially received, a top U.S. general said on Wednesday.
While pressure has been building for peace talks between the Western-backed government in Kabul and the Taliban insurgency, U.S. officials say Islamic State's branch in Afghanistan is not part of any reconciliation push and instead must be wiped out.
Even by the bloody standards of the Afghan war, Islamic State has gained an unmatched reputation for brutality, routinely beheading opponents or forcing them to sit on explosives.
But last week, an Afghan governor's office floated the possibility of amnesty for a large group of Islamic State fighters, including two senior commanders, who gave themselves up after being driven from their strongholds by Taliban insurgents.
U.S. Army General Joseph Votel, head of the U.S. military's Central Command, said the Afghans acknowledged the surrender, the largest of its kind so far by Islamic State, ""could have been handled better.""
""The government of Afghanistan has assured us that these ISIS-K fighters will be treated as war prisoners,"" Votel told a news briefing at the Pentagon, using an acronym for the Afghan affiliate of the group. 
Votel said that the fighters would be investigated and held to account for any war crimes they committed.
Civilians who fled the last clashes have accused Islamic State fighters of atrocities, giving detailed accounts of women and young girls being taken from their families, raped and, in some cases, murdered.
""They have essentially waged a pretty vicious campaign against the people without regard to civilian casualties,"" Votel said.
In another example of Islamic State's tactics, the group on Saturday claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing on a Shi'ite Muslim mosque in eastern Afghanistan that killed 39 people and wounded at least 80 others.
As the U.S.-backed Afghan army presses Afghan insurgents, the central government in Kabul is also pursuing peace with their main enemy, the Taliban, even declaring a three-day ceasefire in June that saw unarmed Taliban fighters mingling with soldiers on the streets.
Perhaps in that context, local Afghan officials had initially hoped that treating this batch of Islamic State fighters well would entice more of them to surrender. 
That, however, was not the approach of the United States or of the central government in Kabul, Votel said.
Although Washington ultimately seeks an Afghan-led peace agreement with the Taliban, Votel said the U.S. and Afghan position on Islamic State was clear: ""We've all agreed (it's) an organization that just needs to be destroyed.""
The back-and-forth over Islamic State speaks volumes about confusion as Kabul and the West are trying to find a way to end 17 years of war against insurgents. 
U.S. President Donald Trump a year ago reluctantly agreed to an open-ended deployment of U.S. military advisers, trainers and special forces and increased air support for Afghan forces. Roughly 14,000 U.S. troops are deployed in Afghanistan along with 8,000 other coalition forces, according to Pentagon data.
But Trump has proven capable of reversing himself and U.S. officials privately acknowledge a sense of urgency to show that America's longest war can still bring a degree of stability to Afghanistan. A senior U.S. diplomat met with a Taliban representatives in Doha in July.
Votel acknowledged that the incoming U.S. commander, Army General Scott Miller, would do his own review but predicted no major changes to the war plan approved by Trump last year. 

""I can't predict exactly what General Miller may say in terms of this. But as I've commented, my personal view is that the strategy we have in place is the right one,"" Votel said.

CUCUTA, Colombia (Reuters) - The United States is ""not willing to wait for too long"" for North Korea to take steps toward denuclearization, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Wednesday.
At a landmark summit in June, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump pledged to work to end Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programs, but the two countries have been struggling to reach a detailed accord to meet that goal.
""This is all in North Korea's court,"" Haley told reporters traveling with her during a visit to Colombia, where she attended the inauguration of new Colombian President Ivan Duque and met migrants who had fled Venezuela.
""They have to understand that the international community still expects them to denuclearize and so we're willing to wait if they want to wait, but we're not willing to wait for too long,"" said Haley, who has pushed through three U.N. sanctions packages since arriving at the world body 18 months ago. 
White House national security adviser John Bolton on Tuesday said U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was prepared to return to North Korea for another meeting with Kim.
Haley said Pompeo had delivered ""solid"" U.S. demands to North Korea and that Washington would not weaken those or ease sanctions on Pyongyang. Russia and China have suggested the U.N. Security Council could discuss loosening sanctions on Pyongyang after the June 12 Singapore meeting between Trump and Kim.

""It's going to be a long process, we knew this wasn't going to happen overnight,"" said Haley. ""We have to see denuclearization and we're not going to stop until we get it.""

For decades, Gordillo led one of Latin America's largest unions and was known for her close ties to the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. She gained notoriety for living a lavish lifestyle that critics saw as a symbol of impunity and graft.
""I received ... notification of the decree of my absolute and immediate freedom due to the dismissal of charges in the criminal case under which I was a subject,"" according to a letter written by Gordillo but read by her lawyer, Marco Antonio del Toro.
Del Toro said the notification was issued late on Tuesday night and that Gordillo will speak publicly about the dismissal on Aug. 20.
""I need time to privately assimilate the emotions that stem from such an important personal issue,"" she added in the letter.
In a brief statement, the attorney general's office said that while it ""respects the decision ... it does not agree with it.""
It was not clear if the government would appeal or otherwise seek to block the decision by a federal criminal court to dismiss the charges.
Gordillo, 72, was arrested in early 2013, accused of embezzling $200 million in union funds, just a day after President Enrique Pena Nieto signed into law a major education reform that Gordillo opposed.
She faced charges of using intermediaries to move money to bank accounts in Switzerland and Liechtenstein, and then back to the United States, in order to buy property in San Diego and pay for works of art and plastic surgery.
At the time of her arrest, the government said Gordillo had declared income of just 1.1 million pesos ($59,500) between 2009 and 2012.
Late last year, Gordillo was transferred from prison and placed under house arrest after the New Alliance political party she founded announced it would support Pena Nieto's PRI in last July's presidential election.
Leftist candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador won the vote in a landslide while the PRI's standard-bearer came in a distant third. Lopez Obrador will take office in December.

1586,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 02:59PM ET</span>",Italy's PM Conte sees no rush for Libyan election,"By Giselda Vagnoni
ROME (Reuters) - Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Wednesday that it is not vital for Libya to vote this year, signaling doubts about a French-led push to hold elections in December to stabilize and unify the North African country.
Italy and France are competing for influence in war-torn Libya, an oil and gas rich country which has been staging area for people smugglers who have sent hundreds of thousands of people on rickety boats toward Europe in recent years.
The nation splintered following the 2011 NATO-backed revolt that toppled Muammar Gaddafi, and since 2014 has been divided between competing political and military groups based in Tripoli and the east.
Italy has close relations with authorities in Tripoli and is the only Western country to have reopened its embassy in the Libyan capital, home to a U.N.-brokered transitional government. France is seen as closer to military commander Khalifa Haftar, who is aligned with a rival government based in the east.
Seeking to end the turmoil, French President Emmanuel Macron hosted a conference in May where rival Libyan factions agreed to work constructively with the United Nations for a national election by December 10.
But after visiting Washington last month, Conte said he would organize a separate conference, with the endorsement of U.S. President Donald Trump.
Conte told journalists in Rome on Wednesday that the Italy conference will most likely be held in November.
""Italy's primary interest is to stabilize Libya and to hold the presidential and political elections with appropriate guarantees. We are in no hurry to have the vote tomorrow, or in November or in December,"" Conte told journalists in Rome.
Nonetheless, a French government spokeswoman said Paris wants to stick to the roadmap that was agreed upon in May and includes the holding of elections by the end of the year as Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said last week.
Asked whether he had received any feedback from Macron over his agreement with the U.S. president, Conte answered that his ""agreement with Trump is not to the detriment of any specific European country"".
More than 640,000 migrants have landed on Italian shores since 2014 on boats mostly hailing from Libya. Numbers have fallen off sharply over the past year, but the new anti-establishment government led by Conte is supporting the Libyan coast guard to try to halt the exodus from its shores.
Libya is a former Italian colony less than 300 km (190 miles) from the Italian island of Lampedusa, and Italy's state-controlled oil company Eni is the biggest foreign oil producer in Libya.

""Trump has recognized a matter of fact: Libya has a strategic relevance for Italy due to historic and geopolitical reasons. The flow of migrants coming from the Libyan coast targeted mainly Italy,"" Conte said.

1588,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 02:38PM ET</span>",Congo's Kabila will not stand for election in December,"By Amedee Mwarabu
KINSHASA (Reuters) - Congo's President Joseph Kabila will not stand in the election scheduled for December, a spokesman said, finally agreeing to obey a two-term limit but picking a hard-core loyalist under European Union sanctions to stand instead. 
The announcement on Wednesday by spokesman Lambert Mende that former interior minister Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary would represent Kabila's ruling coalition in the Dec. 23 vote came just hours before the deadline to register candidates.
Ramazani, dressed in a light suit and flanked by supporters from the coalition, briefly addressed reporters after filing his candidacy later in the afternoon at the headquarters of the national electoral commission in the capital Kinshasa. 
""(Kabila) said there would be no problem. He said there would be no third term. Today, he has kept his promise,"" Ramazani said. ""It is a great honor for me and, with time, we are going to offer a social program."" 
Kabila was due to step down in 2016 at the end of his constitutional mandate. But the election to replace him was repeatedly delayed and he refused to commit explicitly to not seeking a third term.
That sparked protests in which the security forces killed dozens of people, and stoked militia violence in Democratic Republic of Congo's volatile east. 
Kabila had come under strong pressure from regional allies such as Angola as well as the United States and EU to stand down. 
The selection of Ramazani, 57, is, however, a defiant move. He is under EU sanctions for alleged human rights abuses, including deadly crackdowns by security forces on protesters.
Kabila's choice of a die-hard loyalist suggests that the president, who came to power after his father's assassination in 2001, intends to remain closely involved in national politics. He will be eligible to run again in 2023. 
A Ramazani victory could also lead to a continuation of Kabila's policies, including a tough line on the mining sector, where foreign investors hope the government will walk back steep tax hikes approved earlier this year. 
Congo is Africa's top producer of copper and the world's leading miner of cobalt, which is prized for its use in batteries for electric cars and other electronics.
KABILA PULLS THE STRINGS? 
Kabila will remain at the head of his People's Party for Reconstruction and Democracy (PPRD) and has installed loyalists across the federal bureaucracy, including in the courts and in the military. 
But the announcement that he will not run again will ease fears in the region and beyond that a Kabila candidacy would drag the country back into the civil wars of the turn of the century in which millions died, mostly from hunger and disease.
""What matters for the moment is that the constitution, whether willingly or not, has been respected,"" said Senator Jacques Ndjoli of the opposition MLC party of former vice president and presidential candidate Jean-Pierre Bemba. 
""Despite the multiple attempts to circumvent the constitution, President Kabila finally understood that the supreme law applies to everyone.""
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said in a statement that she welcomed the announcement but that much more needed to be done to ensure a credible election in December. 
The election should herald Congo's first democratic transition of power following decades marked by authoritarian rule, coups and deadly conflict.
Ramazani, a former governor of the eastern province of Maniema, served as interior minister from late 2016 until this February, when he was named permanent secretary of the PPRD. 
He is a combative defender of Kabila and oversaw repeated crackdowns on protesters and pro-democracy groups as interior minister, especially in the aftermath of Kabila's refusal to quit power when his mandate expired in December 2016. 
In May 2017, the EU slapped a travel ban and asset freeze on him for his involvement in ""planning, directing or committing acts that constitute serious human rights violations"". 
Several opposition candidates, including Bemba and the president of Congo's largest opposition party, Felix Tshisekedi, have also registered to run.
By the close of registration on Wednesday evening, more than two dozen candidates had filed their candidacies. The definitive list of candidates will be published on Sept. 19. 
Opposition leaders fear the goodwill Kabila could earn from not seeking a new term could make it easier for his coalition to cheat and are concerned about electronic voting machines due to be used for the first time. 
His supporters dismiss these concerns.
""Today, Kabila has shown that he is the father of democracy in Congo,"" Patrick Nkanga, a PPRD official, told Reuters by telephone.
A nationwide opinion poll last month showed opposition candidates collecting a significant majority of the vote with potential candidates from the ruling coalition trailing far behind.

The joint leader in that poll, former provincial governor Moise Katumbi, was refused re-entry to Congo at the weekend after two years in exile and has been unable to register. Ramazani did not receive enough votes to be included in the poll's results.

KARANGPANGSOR, Indonesia (Reuters) - The death toll from last weekend's powerful earthquake on Indonesia's Lombok island rose to 131 on Wednesday as rescuers found more people crushed under collapsed buildings, though some still held out hope of finding survivors.
""We don't know for sure how many people are alive under the rubble,"" Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency (BNPB) told reporters in Jakarta.
""There are reports ... that there are people buried alive, it is a critical time for immediate evacuation,"" he added, without giving details.
(GRAPHIC: Earthquake in Indonesia's Lombok - https://tmsnrt.rs/2OfAvrV)
BNPB had previously put the number of dead at 105, including two on the western neighboring island of Bali, which also felt the 6.9 magnitude quake. Sutopo said the figure would rise still further.
Lombok had already been hit by a 6.4 magnitude earthquake on July 29 that killed 17 people and briefly stranded several hundred trekkers on the slopes of a volcano.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes. In 2004, the Indian Ocean tsunami killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.
A woman was pulled alive on Tuesday from under a grocery store that fell apart in the rural north of the tropical holiday island, near the epicenter of Sunday's quake.
Rescuers dug through the rubble of a mosque on Wednesday, hoping to reach the aunt of a sprinter who became a national hero last month at the under-20 world championships in Finland.
Salama, 52, was at a prayer class in the Karangpangsor village mosque when the quake struck. She is an aunt by marriage of Lalu Muhammad Zohri, who just over a year ago could barely afford running shoes and was hardly known outside his village.
The 18-year-old became a household name almost overnight in July, when he won the 100 meters gold at the World Junior Championships in Tampere, Finland. Now he carries the hopes of Indonesia at the Asian Games that the Southeast Asian nation is preparing to host in the next few weeks.
He lives two doors away from his aunt's home.
Rescuers used a mechanical digger to clear a jumble of metal rods and concrete beside the still-intact green dome of the mosque, but there were no signs that the woman was alive and relatives appeared to have lost hope.
""Hopefully, now, with the arrival of heavy equipment, we can get her remains back,"" said Husni, another family member.
""GHOST TOWNS""
As hopes of finding more survivors faded, a humanitarian crisis loomed for thousands left homeless and in desperate need of clean water, food, medicine and shelter.
About three-quarters of Lombok's north has been without electricity since Sunday, officials said, and aid workers are finding some hamlets hard to reach because bridges and roads were torn up by the disaster.
""Teams are speaking of coming across ghost towns, villages that have essentially been abandoned,"" Matthew Cochrane of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said in Geneva on Tuesday. 
He added that 80 percent of buildings had been damaged or destroyed, with thousands displaced.
Thousands of tourists have left Lombok since Sunday, fearing further earthquakes, some on extra flights provided by airlines and others on ferries to Bali.

Officials said that nearly 8,400 tourists and resort workers had been evacuated from the three Gili islands off the northwest coast of Lombok, where two people died, emptying out a destination popular for its white beaches and turquoise waters.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Turkish delegation met with the State Department's No. 2 official, John Sullivan, on Wednesday to address friction between the NATO allies fueled by Ankara's detention of several Americans including an evangelical pastor.
There were no signs of a breakthrough, however, after the hour-long talks.
Turkey's lira weakened against the dollar on Wednesday, hit by concern about President Tayyip Erdogan's grip on monetary policy and uncertainty about whether the meeting could heal their wide diplomatic rift. 
The lira  stood at 5.2880 to the dollar at 1223 GMT, more than 1 percent weaker on the day. It had gained on Tuesday on reports the delegation would visit Washington
""We held additional talks with Turkish officials. The conversations continue,"" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement after the meeting.
The delegation of roughly half a dozen officials was led by newly appointed Turkish Deputy Foreign Minister Sedat Onal and Turkey's ambassador to Washington Serdar Kilic.
They did not answer questions from reporters as they left the meeting with Sullivan, the deputy secretary of state.
A U.S. Treasury spokeswoman said the delegation would also meet Treasury officials later on Wednesday.
The Treasury meeting comes a week after it imposed U.S. sanctions on Erdogan's justice minister and interior minister for reneging on a commitment to release pastor Andrew Brunson. There are also deep concerns in Ankara as the United States considers a fine against Turkey's state-owned Halkbank for allegedly helping Iran evade U.S. sanctions.
The two countries remain at odds on the core U.S. demand that Ankara free Brunson.
The State Department has said little about its talks with Turkey over Brunson, although it acknowledged on Tuesday that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had spoken to his Turkish counterpart on Monday.
Nauert told a briefing the two had not yet reached agreement on the release of Brunson. ""We're not there just yet,"" she said in response to reports in Turkey that an agreement had been reached on several issues.
The pastor had been imprisoned by Turkey since October 2016 but was released to house arrest in late July.
Brunson, an evangelical Presbyterian pastor from North Carolina, was jailed for allegedly supporting a group that Ankara blames for an attempted coup in 2016. Brunson denies the charge. Washington is also seeking the release of three locally employed U.S. embassy staff.
Trade issues and differences over Syria have also strained bilateral ties.
The Turkish delegation ""is looking for any deal because they've got to have something to go back to Ankara with,"" a former U.S. official familiar with both sides' positions said.
""I don’t see the U.S. side agreeing to a comprehensive settlement until they release Brunson,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The official said among a series of requests in exchange for Brunson's release, Turkey was seeking to minimize damage to Halkbank from the fine the U.S. Treasury is expected to impose. The bank has said all of its transactions have been lawful.
Turkey was also seeking the early release of Halkbank executive Mehmet Hakan Atilla, who was sentenced in May to 32 months in prison by a federal court in New York for taking part in a scheme to help Iran avoid U.S. sanctions.
Turkey is also pushing for the extradition of Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric living in the United States who is accused by the Erdogan government of masterminding the failed 2016 coup, and for the delivery of advanced F-35 fighter jets blocked by Congress following Turkey’s agreement to purchase S-400 air defense missile batteries from Russia.
The administration, however, is limited in what it can agree to, the official said, because Gulen faces no charges in the United States, and the ban on the F-35 deliveries was included in the defense authorization act now awaiting Trump's signature.
Washington is reviewing Turkey's duty-free access to U.S. markets, while Ankara has imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods in response to American steel and aluminum tariffs. The U.S. review could affect $1.7 billion of Turkish exports.
Turkey's energy minister said on Wednesday Turkey will continue to buy natural gas from Iran in line with its long-term supply contract despite U.S. sanctions against Tehran. 
The chill in relations with Washington has hurt investor confidence in Turkey, which relies on overseas capital to fund its widening current account deficit. 

The Turkish lira has collapsed this year, pressuring banks and corporate loans and wiping out a third of the value of foreign investors' holdings of lira bonds but data shows there have not yet been net foreign portfolio sales.

Investigators identified the men as Paulyuk Bykowski, who Deutsche Welle said was its longtime correspondent in the country, and Alexei Zhukov, who works for a local news site, and said they had been detained as part of a criminal investigation.
Several other journalists were detained on Tuesday in connection with the same case. Local rights groups said then that the arrests were part of a government drive to muzzle independent media.
Deutsche Welle confirmed that Bykowski, who is a Belarussian citizen, was arrested on Wednesday, after a two-hour search of his home.
The broadcaster said it had lodged a protest with Belarus's ambassador in Berlin about Bykowski's arrest, and was demanding his immediate release. 
Bykowski's wife Volha Bykowskaja said authorities carried out a two-hour search of the home and seized computers, tablets, phones, USB sticks and bank cards. She said his detention was ""absurd"".
Bykowski had appeared on a radio program on Tuesday to discuss searches of the newsrooms of privately-owned Tut.by, Belarus's biggest online news portal, with 800,000 daily unique users, and independent news agency BelaPAN.
Germany's foreign ministry noted the arrests and newsroom searches carried out on Tuesday, and said on Wednesday it had urged the Minsk government to respect press freedom and refrain from disproportionate actions against journalists.
""The German government advocates for protection of the basic principles of freedom of the media and opinion,"" a ministry spokesman said in a statement.
President Alexander Lukashenko has run Belarus along Soviet-style command lines since 1994. He has heeded some calls from the West to show more leniency toward political opposition, but opponents say their freedom to operate remains severely limited.

The sanctions imposed on Tehran this week have already led banks and many companies around the world to scale back dealings with Iran. Companies doing business with Iran will be barred from the United States, President Donald Trump said on Tuesday.
""With regard to our situation do not be worried at all. Nobody can do anything,"" Khamenei said recently, the website reported. 
""They can be sure. There is no doubt about this,"" Khamenei was quoted as saying in comments that appeared only a day after the new U.S. sanctions took effect.
U.S. officials have said in recent weeks that they aim to pressure countries to stop buying oil from Iran in a bid to force Tehran to halt its nuclear and missile programs and involvement in regional conflicts in Syria and Iraq.
""These are the most biting sanctions ever imposed,"" Trump tweeted on Tuesday.
Separately, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Wednesday that a U.S. plan to reduce Iran's oil exports to zero will not succeed, according to the Iran newspaper.
""If the Americans want to keep this simplistic and impossible idea in their minds they should also know its consequences,"" Zarif told the Iran newspaper.
""They can’t think that Iran won’t export oil and others will export.""
President Hassan Rouhani hinted last month that Iran could block the Strait of Hormuz, a major oil shipping route, if the U.S. attempted to stop the Islamic Republic’s oil exports.
U.S. President Donald Trump responded by noting that Iran could face serious consequences if it threatened the United States.
""The Americans have assembled a war room against Iran,"" Zarif said. ""We can’t get drawn into a confrontation with America by falling into this war room trap and playing on a battlefield.""
Last month, Trump offered to meet Iran's leaders. Zarif said that Oman and Switzerland have acted as mediators in talks with America in the past but that there are currently no direct or indirect talks being held with the United States.
Rouhani, speaking in a meeting with North Korea's foreign minister on Wednesday, said that America cannot be trusted, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA).

""Today, America is identified as an unreliable and untrustworthy country in the world which does not adhere to any of its obligations,"" Rouhani said.

MANGINA, Congo (Reuters) - Congolese officials and the World Health Organization began vaccinating health workers against the deadly Ebola virus on Wednesday, to try to halt an outbreak in Congo's volatile east. 
A Reuters witness on a visit to Mangina, the village in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo where the epidemic was declared, saw health workers in protective suits administering the injections.
So far 43 people are believed to have been infected in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, including 36 who have died, the health ministry said on Tuesday.
""We are putting all our energy and all our expertise to quickly control this epidemic,"" Health Minister Oly Ilunga told journalists at the start of the vaccination campaign.
""All the measures of prevention are in place. The vaccination is the last phase. It will enable us to break the chain of transmission of this epidemic."" 
More than 900 contacts of those infected have been identified for monitoring, although security is an issue in the area where militia groups operate, WHO said..
The disease, which causes fever, vomiting and diarrhea, is spread through direct contact with body fluids.
""Around 40 health workers are expected to be vaccinated today; by end of the week, once all the necessary steps are in place, vaccination of community contacts and their contacts will commence,"" WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said.
WHO has said that analysis of genetic sequencing showed it was a separate outbreak from the one 2,500 km (1,500 miles) away in the northwest that ended less than two weeks ago after killing 33 people -- but the same Zaire strain.
This is Congo's 10th Ebola outbreak since the virus was first identified near northern Congo's Ebola river.
""There is a huge fear among the local population,"" Kaswera Mathumo, a medical worker at a clinic in Mangina, where the vaccinations were taking place, said.
The experimental vaccine being used, which is manufactured by Merck (NYSE:MRK), proved successful during its first wide-scale usage against the previous outbreak in Equateur Province. 
More than 3,000 doses remain in stock in the capital Kinshasa, allowing authorities to deploy them quickly to affected areas.
But they face security challenges in eastern Congo, a region bubbling with conflicts over land and ethnicity stoked by decades of on-off war. 

Local authorities announced on Tuesday that 14 bodies had been discovered in the town of Tubameme, about 40 km (25 miles) northeast of the epicenter of the outbreak in the town of Mangina, suspected to have been killed by a militia group.

The local government official in the county, who asked not to be named, said the attack occurred between the areas of Majengo and Bodhei. He said five soldiers were killed after their truck ran over an improvised explosive device.
""We heard a blast. Shortly after, KDF (Kenya Defence Forces) choppers were patrolling in the air,"" the official told Reuters.
Kenya Defence Forces spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Paul Njuguna told Reuters that six soldiers were injured, two critically, in the explosion but none were killed. 
It was not immediately clear why the accounts of the KDF and the county official differed.
Abdiasis Abu Musab, al Shabaab's spokesman for military operations, said the group was behind the attack on the KDF convoy, and put the number of those killed at nine. 
Kenyan officials say the group often exaggerates casualty figures. 
The al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab aims to topple Somalia's U.N.-backed government and impose its own strict interpretation of Islam. They have intensified attacks in Kenya since it sent troops into Somalia in 2011.
The group has launched several attacks, including ones in which they have beheaded people, in the past year in the coastal county. Kenyan security officials say the militants have used the Boni forest straddling the Kenya-Somalia border as a hideout and base for attacks.

1596,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 01:00PM ET</span>","U.S.-Mexico border arrests fall in July, fewer unaccompanied children","By Yeganeh Torbati
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. border agents arrested about 8 percent fewer people in July at the southwest border than in June, but the number of migrant families detained remained nearly constant, according to figures released on Wednesday by the Department of Homeland Security.
A total of 31,303 people were arrested at the U.S. border with Mexico in July, compared to 34,095 in June. Of those detained after attempting to enter the United States illegally, about 4,000 were children crossing the U.S.-Mexico border alone, compared to about 5,100 children in June.
About 9,300 ""family units"" were arrested, according to the data, nearly unchanged from the prior month's 9,400.
The numbers come in the wake of President Donald Trump's ""zero tolerance"" policy, implemented in May, in which federal agencies were ordered to prosecute all immigrants apprehended entering the United States illegally.
Under the policy, parents were held in federal detention pending prosecution, while their children were sent to shelters or foster homes, often far from their parents. More than 2,500 children were separated from their parents, and more than 400 parents are believed to have been deported without being reunited with their children.
In June, Trump ended the family separations after an intense public outcry. But his administration has sought to attribute a two-month drop in arrests at the southern border to its policy of prosecuting more people for crossing illegally.
""This decrease shows that when there are real consequences for breaking the law, the conduct of those considering crimes will change,"" DHS spokesman Tyler Houlton said in a statement on Wednesday.
Month-to-month fluctuations in arrests at the border are typical, however. In every year since 2006, except 2017, July arrests have been lower than those in June, according to U.S. Border Patrol data. 
Border apprehensions plummeted during the first few months of Trump's presidency, to a low of 11,126 in April 2017, but have since crept back up to levels comparable with those during the Obama administration.
Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the Migration Policy Institute, a non-partisan group, said the trend of border crossings this year is similar to periods during the Obama administration, when no zero tolerance policy was in place.

""There's no evidence that any policy change they've made one way or another has significantly affected the seasonal pattern of apprehensions over the last few months,"" Capps said.

1597,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>","Libya's sovereign wealth fund to move offices after abductions, threats","TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libya's sovereign wealth fund has decided to move from its main office in Tripoli due to security breaches after a number of staff were threatened or abducted, it said in statement on Wednesday.
The Libyan Investment Authority (LIA), which holds about $66 billion-worth of mostly frozen assets, has long been at the center of leadership disputes and power struggles that reflect Libya's political splits.
These have sometimes played out at the LIA's main offices in the Tripoli Tower office block, where the head of the fund appointed two years ago by Libya's internationally recognized government, Ali Mahmoud Hassan Mohamed, had managed to install himself following a dispute with a rival claimant. 
Tripoli is largely controlled by a handful of powerful armed groups claiming official status that have expanded their economic interests, penetrated key institutions and frequently abduct rivals with impunity.
""The Libyan Investment Authority is faced with a series of violations and abuses due to blatant interference by armed members of the battalion charged with protecting the tower,"" the LIA said.
""The authority rejects these actions and announces the transfer of its headquarters from Tripoli Tower as a result of security breaches."" 
The LIA said staff had been threatened, intimidated and had their movements restricted, and that some employees were abducted and held at a nearby base. Heads of departments were told not to comply with instructions from management. 
""The IT manager was forced to suspend the e-mail of the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, the chief financial officer and the operations manager,"" the LIA statement said.
The LIA was created to invest oil revenues earned before a NATO-backed uprising in 2011 toppled long-serving ruler Muammar Gaddafi and divided Libya into territory controlled by rival factions.
The fund has been involved in several high profile international lawsuits over investments made prior to 2011.

1598,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 12:26PM ET</span>",Crews gain ground on monster California wildfire,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Crews battling the largest wildfire in California history took advantage of milder overnight temperatures to gain considerable ground in containing the blaze on Wednesday, a day after officials it would take until September to snuff it out.
The Mendocino Complex fire, which has scorched an area of northern California almost the size of Los Angeles, was 47 percent contained on Wednesday morning, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said. A day earlier, the fire was 34 percent contained.
So far, two firefighters have been injured fighting the blaze, which has consumed more than 300,000 acres. While sprawling, the wildfire was less destructive than last week's Carr Fire near Redding, destroying 75 homes and forcing the evacuation of more than 23,000 people. The Carr Fire destroyed more than 1,000 structures.
Overnight temperatures for Wednesday and Thursday should drop to a low of 64 degrees (18 Celsius) but highs were forecast to hit 98 degrees (36 Celsius) on Wednesday and 99 (37 Celsius) on Thursday, said National Weather Service meteorology intern Jennifer Guenehner. 
Some 4,000 firefighters were working on Wednesday to stop the fire from reaching communities at the southern tip of the Mendocino National Forest, about 100 miles north of San Francisco. The blaze is still threatening more than 10,000 structures, Cal Fire said.
The Mendocino Complex is one of 17 major fires burning in California that have destroyed more than 1,500 structures and displaced tens of thousands of people over the past month. 
Cal Fire on Tuesday pushed back the date when it expected to bring the Mendocino fire under full control to Sept. 1, the fourth time the department has revised its timetable as the massive wildfire expanded.
The fire became the largest in California history on Monday, after officials began battling two separate blazes in the Mendocino area as a single event, according to Cal Fire. 
Now, having scorched more than 300,000 acres, the blaze has surpassed the Thomas Fire, which burned 281,893 acres in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties in southern California last December, destroying more than 1,000 structures. 
Since Sunday, President Donald Trump has claimed, without substantiating his remarks, that California was letting water run into the ocean instead of using it to fight blazes, and he blamed California's environmental policies for worsening the fires.
The comments baffled California firefighters, who said they had more than enough water to douse the flames. 
Climate change is widely blamed for the higher temperatures that have fueled wildfires in California, and further afield like in Portugal, Sweden and Siberia. 

The California fires are on track to be the most destructive in a decade, prompting Democratic Governor Jerry Brown and Republican leaders such as state Senator Ted Gaines to call for thinning forests and controlled burns to reduce fire danger. Environmentalists oppose such preventive burns, saying they kill wildlife.

Bui Van Thanh, Deputy Minister of Public Security, was fired for ""very serious violations"", Phuc said in a statement without elaborating. The decision took effect immediately.
Vietnamese authorities have arrested dozens of officials and business figures in a crackdown mixed with political intrigue in the one-party communist state.
The Communist party late last month stripped Thanh, 60, of all of his party credentials saying he violated regulations on state secrets and illegally issued documents on land management, the government said in a separate statement.
Thanh was also accused of illegally issuing a diplomatic passport to business tycoon Phan Van Anh Vu, who was sentenced to seven years in prison at a closed trial more than a week ago, convicted of deliberate disclosure of state secrets.
""Thanh's violations caused very serious consequences, affecting the prestige of the party, the police force and causing public anger,"" according to the government statement.
Phuc also demoted Thanh from Lieutenant General to Colonel, according to the government statement.
Last week, a military court sentenced the first military official to go on trial in the corruption crackdown to 12 years in jail.

AMIENS, France (Reuters) - Britain and France on Tuesday marked 100 years since the decisive battle of Amiens that put Europe on the path to the end of World War One, in a sober ceremony in the northern French city's Gothic cathedral.
British Prime Minister Theresa May and serving army officers read letters and poetry from those who fought in the often-forgotten battle that took conflict out of the trenches and ushered in an armistice 100 days later.
""Amiens was symbolic of the Entente Cordiale, the co-operation without which victory was impossible,"" Britain's Prince William said. 
""Today we return to learn more about the experience of those involved during the historic summer of 1918, to honor the fallen of all nations, to commemorate all those who participated in this great endeavor, and to celebrate the bonds of friendship which unite our nations.""
Descendants of soldiers who fought in the battle took part in the ceremony alongside officials from France, Canada, Australia, Ireland and the United States.
May read an extract from the war memoirs of the then-British prime minister, David Lloyd George, which recalled how ""the British army itself did not realize the extent and effect of the triumph they had won that day"".
The decisive battle began at 4.20 a.m. on Aug. 8, 1918, when 900 Allied guns opened fire in a surprise attack on German forces.
Allied troops gained eight miles in one day, captured 450 artillery pieces and 12,000 prisoners -- a huge advance in a war until then characterized by miniscule gains and entrenched stalemate.
Allied forces suffered 19,000 casualties in the three-day battle, while 27,000 German troops were killed or wounded.
At the time, German general Erich Ludendorff described the battle as the ""black day of the German army"".
Around 100,000 Australian, British, Canadian and French troops were committed to the offensive.
Among them were British brothers Tom and Robert Slater of the Northumberland Fusiliers. Tom survived, but Robert was killed on the second day of the battle.
Attending the ceremony were Tom's grandchildren, Dave Slater and Carolyn Gardner, who had only discovered online 10 years ago that their great-uncle had died at Amiens.

""It's almost a hundred years since our great-uncle passed away. And for me, it's important to remember the family. It's important to remember the young men who lost their lives, because it is the ultimate sacrifice,"" said Gardner, 58.

The incident on Aug. 5 near Bagram Air Field in eastern Afghanistan brought the number of Czech soldiers killed in foreign missions to 28 since the country's 1989 transition from communism to democracy.
It was the first such loss since four soldiers were killed in a suicide attack in Afghanistan in 2014 in the bloodiest incident in the Czech Army's modern history.
The fallen - Martin Marcin, 36, Kamil Benes, 28, and Patrik Stepanek, 24 - were part of NATO's Resolute Support Mission to which the Czech Republic contributes nearly 250 soldiers.
Their patrol was checking a street near the base when it was approached by a man who detonated an improvised explosive device, killing the three Czechs and wounding one U.S. and two Afghani soldiers.
A state plane accompanied by Czech Air Force jets brought the Czech soldiers' bodies to Prague airport. A convoy of military and burial service vehicles transported the soldiers to the central military hospital. 
Dozens of people gathered at army headquarters to pay their respects. Sirens also rang for 2 minutes 20 seconds at noon. 
Prime Minister Andrej Babis reacted to the weekend attack by calling the soldiers heroes. 
Babis's minority government, comprising his ANO party and the Social Democrats, won a parliamentary confidence vote last month, leaning on the votes of the anti-NATO Communist party - giving the former pariah organization its biggest voice in national politics since the end of one-party rule in 1989.

However Babis in June aligned his party with the majority of lawmakers to approve plans to raise the number of troops on foreign missions with NATO allies, including in Afghanistan, dismissing Communist objections.

ABUJA (Reuters) - The leader of Nigeria's Senate on Wednesday called for an investigation into a blockade of parliament by security forces and said it was an attempt to secure his impeachment but stopped short of saying he would run for president next February.
Senate President Bukola Saraki, Nigeria's third most senior elected official, last week defected from President Muhammadu Buhari's ruling party to the main opposition and is fast becoming a leading critic of the president. 
He is the most high profile of the some 50 lawmakers who have left Buhari's party in the last few weeks, presenting a challenge for the president's bid to secure a second term at the helm of Africa's top oil producer.
The blockade by armed members of the Department of State Security (DSS) on Tuesday was the first such incident since the transition to civilian rule in 1999 and coincides with rising tension between lawmakers and the executive.
""We call for an investigation, and we demand that all perpetrators are brought to book,"" said Saraki during a news conference in the capital, Abuja. 
He said the blockade was ""an act of cowardice by those seeking to carry out an illegal impeachment of the leadership of the Senate in flagrant disregard of the law"". 
Saraki said the aim was to bar members of the opposition PDP so that a vote of lawmakers could be convened at which the two-thirds majority needed to impeach and replace him could be secured. 
Defections have cost the ruling APC its majority in the Senate, parliament's upper house, presenting a challenge to Buhari's re-election bid by closing access to key patronage networks.
Saraki, when asked, refused to rule out running for president next year: ""When the time is right, I will talk on that issue.""
Yemi Osinbajo, usually vice president who is acting president while Buhari is in Britain on holiday, said the action by the DSS officers was ""completely unacceptable"" and was taken without the presidency's knowledge. He fired the DSS chief within hours of the blockade. 
But, in an emailed statement issued on Wednesday, the APC appeared to row back from Osinbajo's criticism. It accused Saraki of plotting to ""foment violence in the legislative chamber all in a bid to stop his impeachment"".

""We are now aware that the timely intervention of the security operatives forestalled the planned violence,"" it said.

The Tokyo government and authorities in Okinawa have long been at loggerheads over relocation of the U.S. Marines' Futenma air base, which is in an urban area of the island.
Tokyo has been seeking to move the base to a less populated area of the same island, called Henoko, but Onaga wanted the base off the island altogether. Delays in relocating the base have been an irritant in U.S.-Japan relations. 
Okinawa, the site of a bloody World War Two land battle, hosts the bulk of U.S. military forces in Japan, and many residents resent what they see as an unfair burden. 
A gubernatorial election will be held within 50 days after the Okinawa's election administration commission is officially notified of the death of the incumbent governor, an Okinawa official said.

Juan Requesens, a 29-year old lawmaker and former student leader, was detained on Tuesday night in apparent connection with the drone incident. 
Leftist Maduro had said that Requesens, who he described as ""one of the craziest ones, a psychopath,"" had been implicated in the launch of two DJI M600 drones laden with C4 explosives over an outdoor rally attended by Maduro on Saturday. 
The powerful president of the Constituent Assembly, Diosdado Cabello, said that the pro-government body would on Wednesday discuss lifting immunity for lawmakers involved in the ""failed magnicide attempt.""
Maduro was unharmed in the drone incident. Explosives aboard the drones detonated, injuring seven military officers and sending attendees scurrying for cover. 
Maduro's foes said he was using the drone explosions as an excuse to arrest his rivals and amass power in the oil-rich nation suffering from food shortages, salary-destroying hyperinflation and frequent power cuts.
""If the Constituent Assembly removes our congressional immunity they will be once again violating the constitution and international law. Sooner or later they will go to jail! Venezuela is living a political attack,"" tweeted opposition lawmaker Luis Carlos Padilla.
Requesens' detention further swells the ranks of opposition activists forced into exile, arrested, or barred from politics during Maduro's crackdown on dissent.
""Many of our brothers are outside the country, many are underground because they were killed - because you killed them, Nicolas!"" Requesens had told the opposition-led congress on Tuesday before his evening arrest. 
""And those of us who can still be here are going to keep giving it our all. Today I can speak to you here, but I do not know about tomorrow,"" added Requesens, who was often on the forefront of massive anti-Maduro street protests in 2014 and 2017. 

Maduro counters that he is the victim of a right-wing plot led by the Colombian government and U.S. residents to throw him out of office. On Tuesday night he said investigations had discovered that the drone suspects had prepared at a training camp across the border in Colombia and that 11 hit men had been offered $50 million to assassinate him.

DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh's government demanded on Wednesday that the U.S. embassy withdraw criticism over its handling of days-long student protests in the capital over a fatal traffic accident.
Tens of thousands of students have blocked streets of Dhaka for more than a week, demanding safer roads, after two teenagers were killed by a speeding bus. Police fired tear gas and beat up students to force them to disperse but they have stayed on. Scores of people have been hurt in demonstrations.
On Sunday, the U.S. embassy posted a statement on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) saying youngsters engaging in peaceful protests were exercising their democratic rights and that nothing could justify ""brutal attacks and violence"" against young people. 
The United Nations said it too was concerned about violence in the streets and called for calm. 
Information Minister Hasanul Hoque Inu said police had acted with restraint and that both the United States and the United Nations had overstepped the line with their criticism. 
""We urge to withdraw this statement. This is discourteous,"" Hoque said of the U.S. statement, adding the government would write to the embassy and the United Nations to register its protest. 
On Sunday a group of armed men attacked a vehicle carrying the U.S. ambassador. There were no injuries but two vehicles were damaged. Police said on Wednesday they were still investigating the case.
Students are demanding changes to transport laws following the July 29 deaths, after the driver of a privately operated bus lost control and ran over a group of students. 
Police also said they were retaining custody of activist and photographer Shahidul Alam for more questioning after he was taken to hospital for a checkup on Wednesday. Alam was picked up from his home on Sunday after he had posted comments on social media that a student wing of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ruling party was trying to attack the protesters. 

The police said he was arrested on charges of spreading rumors on social media, aiming to incite violence. His detention has sparked criticism from rights groups.

Their 25-year-old coach, Ekapol Chanthawong, also gained citizenship.
Ekapol and 12 boys had gone to explore the Tham Luang caves in Chiang Rai province on June 23, when a rainy-season downpour flooded the cave system and trapped them underground.
They survived for nine days on water dripping from rocks before they were discovered. An international effort to rescue them ended on July 10 when they all were brought out safely.
Three of the boys and Ekapol were considered stateless, even though they were born in Thailand, until local authorities checked their qualifications, including birth certificates, and approved their requests for Thai citizenship. 
The four were also given Thai national identification cards on Wednesday. 
""They have all the qualifications,"" said Somsak Kanakam, chief officer of Mae Sai district in Chiang Rai. ""All children born in Thailand must have Thai birth certificates in order to qualify for Thai citizenship.""
Citizenship requests for some twenty other people, most of them children, were also approved, Somsak added. 
Many stateless people in Thailand come from areas where national borders have changed, leaving their nationality in question. Some belong to ""hill tribes"" living in remote areas with limited access to information about nationality procedures, according to the United Nations refugee agency.
The cave ordeal highlighted the plight of people from Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar living in Thailand who are denied some rights and opportunities because they are not citizens.
More than 486,000 people are registered as stateless, according to official data. Of that number 146,269 are younger than 18 years old.

1607,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 10:11AM ET</span>","In peace between Ethiopia and Eritrea, UAE lends a helping hand","By Maggie Fick and Alexander Cornwell
ADDIS ABABA/DUBAI (Reuters) - When the leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea embraced in Asmara last month, promising to end the two-decade-old state of war between their two countries, it looked like a sudden breakthrough.
But the rapprochement was, in fact, the culmination of a year of back-channel talks, sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
One of the drivers behind that process was the United States, which has been a major player in the Horn of Africa for decades.
More surprising was the role played by a much smaller nation: the United Arab Emirates.
The oil-rich Gulf state has gained increasing influence in the region in recent years, according to UAE and Ethiopian officials and diplomats.
Driven in part by a desire to tap Ethiopia's growing economy and in part by a fear that rivals such as Iran and Qatar could gain a foothold in the Horn of Africa, the UAE has pushed into the region for more than a decade.
Its newfound assertiveness underscores the shifts underway in the continent, where China now challenges the historic power of western nations and where Russia, Brazil and the UAE and its Gulf States are growing in prominence.
Publicly, the UAE downplays its influence. Minister of State for International Cooperation, Reem al-Hashimy, told an event in Washington last month that her country had ""played a humble role in trying to bring these two countries together"".
But two diplomats in the Gulf told Reuters that the UAE has privately taken credit for the peace agreement.
The Ethiopian prime minister's chief of staff, Fitsum Arega, acknowledged meetings with UAE officials, but said the leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea were responsible for ending the war.
Eritrea's information minister, Yemane Ghebremeskel, was not available for interview when Reuters visited the country's capital, Asmara, last month.
OPPORTUNITY
The UAE has enjoyed virtually unchallenged influence in Eritrea for at least a decade.
Eritrea is the most diplomatically isolated state in Africa. The United Nations imposed sanctions including an arms embargo in 2009, accusing the government of supporting Islamist militants in neighboring Somalia - a charge it denies.
But Abu Dhabi has a military base there which it uses to help prosecute the war in Yemen, located just across the Red Sea. 
Earlier this year, Hashimy, the UAE minister, met with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's predecessor, Hailemariam Desalegn, in Ethiopia.
When Abiy took office in April, Abu Dhabi ramped up that effort. The timing was fortuitious: the UAE's relationship with Somalia, another nation in the Horn of Africa, was falling apart and Abu Dhabi was looking for a new partner.
""After years of investing in Somali security forces, the UAE saw its gains swept away by what it perceived to be an axis of Qatari and Turkish influence,"" said Elizabeth Dickinson of the International Crisis Group. 
A month after taking office, Abiy visited the UAE capital Abu Dhabi to meet Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan. The new Ethiopian leader offered to mediate between Abu Dhabi and Somalia, two diplomats in the Gulf said.
Officials from the UAE affiliate of the Red Crescent society, Emirates Red Crescent, later visited Ethiopia to discuss aid projects with Abiy.
Those visits complemented efforts by Washington to move toward a restoration of relations between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
The United States has been conducting shuttle diplomacy for more than a year, according to regional diplomats. In 2017, Eritrean officials visited Washington twice and again once this year, leaving messages that the Americans passed to Ethiopian officials.
In late April this year, Donald Yamamoto, then the top U.S. official on Africa, met Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki in Asmara – the first visit by a U.S. official of that rank in more than a decade – before meeting Abiy in the Ethiopian capital.
With the promise of financial support from the Gulf and with Washington's backing, Abiy made his move.
""Neither Ethiopia nor Eritrea benefit from a stalemate,"" he said on June 6, a day after his ruling coalition, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), announced it would implement a peace deal with Eritrea dating back to 2000.
""We need to expend all our efforts towards peace and reconciliation and extricate ourselves from petty conflicts and divisions and focus on eliminating poverty.""
Nine days later, Sheikh Mohammed visited Addis Ababa with officials including Sultan Ahmed al-Jaber, the head of the state-owned oil company. 
The prince announced a $3 billion support package, made up of a $1 billion deposit in Ethiopia's central bank and a pledge of $2 billion in investments. 
Ethiopian officials said the deposit, plus an offer from Saudi Arabia of a year's supply of fuel with payment delayed for 12 months, helped ease a foreign exchange crisis that had caused shortages of medicine and a slowdown in manufacturing. 
""[The UAE's] good relationship with both parties helped with re-establishing the relationship between Ethiopia and Eritrea and we see that as a positive thing,"" Saad Ali Shire, Foreign Minister in the semi-autonomous state of Somaliland told Reuters.
DECISION
It's been a long time coming.
Ethiopia and Eritrea are linked by blood and history. An Eritrean secessionist movement helped overthrow a military regime in Addis Ababa in 1991 and the new Ethiopian government then gave Eritrea its independence. 
For a few years the two countries co-existed peacefully. Landlocked Ethiopia depended on Eritrea's main port, which sits on one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.
But in 1998, the two went to war after a border dispute. Two years of brutal fighting left at least 80,000 dead. A shaky ceasefire followed.
Things finally began to change after the death of Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi in 2012. Members of his ruling coalition began quietly discussing how to approach Isaias Afwerki in Eritrea.
""It became clear to us that normalization was not only beneficial to Ethiopia but for the entire region,"" said Hailemariam, who succeeded Meles before resigning in February. 
Ethiopia's ruling coalition agreed in principle during Hailemariam's tenure to accept the peace deal and withdraw Ethiopian troops from a border town awarded to Eritrea in 2002, he said. His story was confirmed by other senior politicians and diplomats in Ethiopia.
But it was the appointment of Abiy that really encouraged Eritrea, Ethiopian officials, politicians and diplomats in the region say.
Preaching forgiveness and an end to the Ethiopian state's preoccupation with security, Abiy cuts a very different figure from his two predecessors.
""The PM made it clear he will work to ensure lasting peace and ... he proved himself through real gestures like releasing political prisoners,"" said his chief of staff Arega.
Abiy was able to act because his party had seen off the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front, long the dominant force within the ruling coalition and traditionally opposed to Eritrea. 
When Isaias, the Eritrean leader, accepted the olive branch, he praised Abiy and welcomed the TPLF's weakening grip on power.
When Abiy and Isaias embraced last month, some in Africa likened the moment to the fall of the Berlin Wall.

A few weeks later the two leaders traveled to Abu Dhabi. A photo from that meeting shows the two men holding hands with the crown prince as he led them up a palace staircase.

1609,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 09:19AM ET</span>","U.N. urges Myanmar to pave way for Rohingya returns, grant citizenship","GENEVA (Reuters) - United Nations aid agencies called on Myanmar on Wednesday to improve conditions in Rakhine state for the safe return of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees from Bangladesh and provide a clear pathway to citizenship for those eligible.
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and U.N. Development Programme (UNDP) said in a joint statement that they needed full access to Rakhine state and were still awaiting permission for international staff to be based in the town of Maungdaw following requests made on June 14.
There was no immediate response from the Myanmar authorities to a Reuters request for comment. 
The United Nations signed an outline deal with Myanmar in early June aimed at eventually allowing hundreds of thousands of Rohingya in Bangladesh to return safely and by choice. But the secret agreement, seen by Reuters, offers no explicit guarantees of citizenship or freedom of movement throughout the country. 
The U.N. agencies said that substantial progress was urgently needed in three key areas: ""granting effective access in Rakhine State; ensuring freedom of movement for all communities; and addressing the root causes of the crisis"".
More than 700,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar's western Rakhine state after a military crackdown that started in August last year in response to attacks by ARSA, a Rohingya armed group, on security posts. 
Myanmar has rejected accusations of ethnic cleansing and dismissed most accounts of atrocities, blaming Rohingya ""terrorists"". It says it is ready to accept back those who fled.
The Rohingya, who regard themselves as native to Rakhine state, are widely considered as interlopers by Myanmar's Buddhist majority and are denied citizenship.
The U.N. said that Rohingya remaining in Rakhine are under local orders that severely restrict their freedom of movement, preventing them from reaching jobs, school and health care, and called for these to be lifted.

1610,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 09:10AM ET</span>",Malaysia orders pictures of LGBT activists removed from exhibit,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - A Malaysian minister on Wednesday said he had ordered the removal of portraits of two lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) activists from a public photography exhibition, as they promoted LGBT activities. 
The lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community is routinely persecuted in Muslim-majority Malaysia, where sodomy is a crime and is seen as a threat to conservative values. 
Domestic media quoted Mujahid Yusof Rawa, the minister of Islamic affairs, as saying he ordered the removal from an exhibition in the northern state of Penang because promotion of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender activities was not in line with government policy.
""I have consistently repeated in parliament that we do not support the promotion of LGBT culture in Malaysia,"" he told reporters in the lobby of parliament, the Star newspaper said.
Reuters could not reach the minister by telephone after office hours to seek a comment.
Nisha Ayub, one of the activists whose portrait was removed, expressed concern, asking for the government to explain its stance ""towards minorities like us"". 
""They talk about rights as a citizen of Malaysia but yet they are denying people like me to even express our love to our own country,"" Nisha, a transgender activist, said in a post on social media site Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
On social media, the sponsor of the exhibition also expressed shock at the minister's move.
""False religiosity and political insecurity is not what the New Malaysia is about and can accept,"" said Vinod Sekhar, adding that Malaysia's diversity, acceptance of differences and human values made it a wonderful country.
Activists say intolerance of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community has grown in Malaysia in recent years. 
In February, a newspaper article detailing how to identify lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals sparked outrage on social media.
Last year, the health ministry drew criticism from activists and campaigners over a contest on ways to ""prevent"" homosexuality and transgenderism. In 2015, Malaysia's highest court upheld a ban on cross-dressing.
Ruling party lawmakers were among those who criticized Wednesday's decision. 
""This incident is indicative of a larger issue, where we continue to deny the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community their rights, opting instead to marginalise and discriminate them,"" said Charles Santiago, a member of the ruling coalition.
On Monday, Mujahid provoked anger from women's rights groups when he said the government was working on a dress code for Muslim women in the private sector to keep them from facing discrimination. 
The non-profit Women's Aid Organization said it rejected efforts to police women's clothing and freedom of expression. 
""Restricting what women wear is, in and of itself, discriminatory, and this policy would end up discriminating against women who do not conform to the code,"" it said in a statement.
Muslims make up 60 percent of Malaysia's population of 32 million, with substantial Buddhist, Christian and Hindu minorities.

The move comes after a dispute between Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and their Bavarian allies over returning migrants that nearly split them and brought down the government. 
Interior Ministry spokeswoman Eleonore Petermann said the two EU countries had signed the deal on Monday that would, from Saturday, enable them to send such migrants back to Spain within 48 hours. Spain did not require anything in return, she added.
A Spanish government spokeswoman said the deal was part of the agreements reached in the last European summit on migration in late June. She said Spain accepted Germany's demand to send back asylum seekers who got to Germany from Spain.
Spain has become the new main entry point for asylum-seekers fleeing Africa. Around 19,000 asylum-seekers arrived in the first five months of this year, almost as many as in all of 2017, eclipsing for the first time the numbers flowing through north Africa to Italy. 
More than 1.6 million migrants have arrived in Germany since mid-2014, provoking tensions and propelling the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) into the national parliament.
German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, leader of Christian Social Union (CSU) - the Bavarian sister party to Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) - is keen to show he is taking action to reduce immigration as his party faces a tough October regional election in which the AfD is expected to fare well.
Germany is seeking similar deals with Italy and Greece. The discussions with those countries are still going on, Petermann said, adding that both Italy and Greece had made counterdemands.
Merkel is due to meet Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez at the weekend and migration will feature in their talks, a spokeswoman for the German government said.
Sanchez pushed migration up the agenda shortly after he took office in June by accepting the Aquarius, an NGO boat carrying 629 migrants that was blocked from docking in Italy and Malta, and says Spain is committed to a joint European response to illegal migration.
Until now it has only been possible to reject migrants at the border if they enter Germany via a safe neighboring country without the necessary documents to enter and do not want to apply for asylum here.
But those who wanted to apply for asylum in Germany could enter up until now even if they had already applied in another country.

SENGGIGI, Indonesia/JAKARTA (Reuters) - Days after a powerful earthquake rocked Indonesia's resort island of Lombok, killing more than 130 people and sending thousands of tourists fleeing, its beach strip stands eerily empty, with shops and hotels shuttered.
Any hotels still open are refusing guests out of safety concerns, while nearby restaurants and dive shops lie vacant in what is usually one of their busiest months of the year, reeling from the devastation of tourism caused by the quake.
""It went from high season just a few days ago to absolutely nothing now,"" lamented Howard Singleton, who owns a beachside restaurant in the west coast town of Senggigi, ravished by striking sunset views of a volcano on neighboring Bali. 
Authorities are still tallying up earthquake losses, but the value of assets destroyed and other damage could easily top 1 trillion rupiah ($69 million), said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman of the National Disaster Mitigation Agency. 
Foreign and domestic tourists fled after Sunday's earthquake of magnitude 6.9 destroyed homes and displaced tens of thousands of people, adding to the havoc from an earlier quake on July 29, although of smaller magnitude, at 6.4.
""We've had light earthquakes in the past, but never anything like this,"" said Marcel De Rijk, owner of Lombok boutique hotel chain Puri Mas Resort, whose beachside hotel and villas will stay closed until September for repairs. 
""We've lost a lot of bookings and future guests are in wait-and-see mode,"" he added. ""I don't think people will choose Lombok anymore this summer.""
Cancellations of tour bookings for Lombok, Indonesia's second-biggest tourism destination after Bali, have surged, the Association of Indonesian Tours and Travel Agencies told Reuters.
""I imagine things will be pretty desperate and I don't expect things to improve before next year,"" said Singleton.
Both experts and tourist businesses say Lombok will recover, but the next few months will be tough.
""I don't foresee any long-term tourism impact for Indonesia,"" said Matt Gebbie, Asia-Pacific director at tourism consultancy Horwarth HTL.
""But the short-term impacts are heartbreaking for local communities. Tourism dollars will go a long way in helping the communities rebuild."" 
""NEEDS DOLLARS NOW""
The quake could not have come at a worse time for President Joko Widodo, who declared last month that Southeast Asia's largest economy ""needs dollars now"" and launched a tourism drive to narrow its current account gap and shore up its currency.
The rupiah  has lost about six percent against the U.S. dollar since the start of 2018, with investors fleeing emerging markets as U.S. interest rates rise and global trade tension rises.
Widodo had ordered ministers in July to find ways to build up a tourism sector that is mostly underdeveloped, despite the country's pristine beaches and scenic landscapes.
Tourism directly contributed less than 2 percent to Indonesia's economy in 2017, far below Thailand and the Philippines, the World Travel and Tourism Council says.
Lombok is one of 10 new destinations, dubbed ""the new Balis"", that Indonesia is developing to help attain Widodo's ambitious target of boosting tourism revenues to 8 percent of GDP and attracting 20 million foreign tourists a year. 
The disaster may be a jolt to those ambitions, but officials say they are not worried. 
Any impact on tourism from the earthquakes will be temporary and will not derail plans for October's IMF-World Bank annual meetings in Bali, Luhut Pandjaitan, the coordinating minister for maritime affairs, told domestic media. 
Some Lombok business owners agree.
De Rijk pointed to the return of tourists after the 2002 nightclub bombings of Bali in which 202 people died.

""History shows that even after the worst scenarios ... tourists will always come back. Lombok is such a beautiful place,"" he said.

Muthuvel Karunanidhi, a dominant figure in the politics of southern India for half a century who had been chief minister of Tamil Nadu state five times, died on Tuesday aged 94.
Television broadcast images of thousands gathered in the state capital, Chennai, to pay their last respects to the leader at a funeral attended by senior politicians, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The stampede happened when a sudden rush among mourners arriving at the site caused many to lose their balance and fall, the Times of India newspaper said. 
""A man and a woman were brought dead to the hospital,"" A. Elango, an official of the Rajiv Gandhi general hospital, told Reuters, adding that 47 people had been admitted for minor injuries.
Karunanidhi, who always appeared in public with dark glasses and a yellow shawl draped over his shoulder, built his political machine as a crusader for social justice. 
He was known for drawing foreign investors to India's second largest state economy, overseeing its emergence as an industrial powerhouse and being credited with opening many industrial and technology parks.

1616,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 07:53AM ET</span>",Pot for pets: U.S. federal law puts vets into a quandary,"By Barbara Goldberg
(Reuters) - A wave of medical research is providing fresh evidence that marijuana may help dogs and cats cope with arthritis, epilepsy, anxiety and other maladies without the side effects of traditional drugs, but veterinarians are afraid to prescribe it for fear of running afoul of federal laws.
At least 30 U.S. states have legalized medical marijuana, but none of them make provisions for ailing animals.
As a result, veterinarians are reluctant to even discuss marijuana, which remains illegal under federal law, over concerns of putting their professional licenses at risk, said Dr. Jeffrey Powers, chair of the American Veterinary Medical Association's subcommittee on cannabinoids. That leaves it to pet owners themselves to make life-altering decisions about dosing and duration of the treatment.
Change could come soon to California, which appears ready to pass the nation’s first law giving veterinarians the legal cover they need to answer questions about using cannabis for pets.
""A human can get their doctor's advice but a dog can't, legally. It's bizarre,"" said Judy Boyle, 62, of Beaver Island, Michigan, whose dog Mac had for years been taking traditional prescription medicines for arthritis and anxiety. The cumulative effect of those drugs was causing Mac's liver to fail.
Research on her home computer convinced Boyle in March to instead regularly give her 40-pound (18 kg) Australian Cattle Dog cannabinoid dog chews. Five months later, he's a much calmer yet more energetic dog, and his liver function has returned to normal for the first time in years, Boyle said.
Cannabidiol – a cannabis plant extract also known as CBD - is the featured ingredient in hemp oils, chews and other pet products that are more popular than ever. CBD is associated with pain relief, as opposed to THC, the ingredient in marijuana which at higher concentrations is associated with euphoric ""high"" feelings.
Since the federal government still bans cannabis as a controlled substance - and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has vowed to get tough on marijuana - many veterinarians have been warned by their state professional licensing boards not to mention it as a treatment option. 
At present, ""veterinarians are in violation of California law if they are incorporating cannabis into their practices,"" the state Veterinary Medical Board said in a statement. The same is true in most states.
SALES SOAR IN SUMMER
Pet lovers, taking matters into their own hands, are snapping up CBD products, according to a 2018 nationwide survey of 1,068 dog owners by Colorado State University veterinary medicine researchers. Nearly 80 percent of respondents said they bought hemp or marijuana products for their dogs.
In the non-scientific online survey, pet owners reported that pot products were nearly 44 percent more effective for a dog's pain relief and 41 percent more effective for anxiety than conventional medicines.
Clinical research into CBD also is beginning to produce results.
Cornell University researchers found CBD increases comfort and activity in dogs with arthritis, according to a study published in July in Frontiers in Veterinary Science. CBD led to a reduction in frequency of seizures in 89 percent of dogs with epilepsy, according to preliminary results of a Colorado State University study released last month.
Interest in CBD products has surged this summer, as July Fourth holiday fireworks and thunderstorms trigger severe anxiety for many pets. In second quarter of 2018, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) searches for CBD products for humans and animals was 12 times higher than a year earlier. The biggest jump was in searches for ""CBD for pets"" and ""hemp for pets,"" GlobalCannabinoids.io, a distributor of hemp-derived cannabinoids, reported this week.
Demand for information is so strong that a panel discussion was packed at CatCon, the world’s biggest cat-centric event held in Pasadena, California, last weekend. It was titled, “Cannabis and Cats: What You Need to Know Meow” 
“I went to my vet and she goes, ‘I can't talk about it,’” said CatCon founder Susan Michals.
“It's an important conversation that needs to be had,"" Michals said. ""It's scary for people to go on and talk to Dr. Google and try and figure (dosage) if your cat weighs eight pounds or your other cat 16 pounds, will you OD (overdose) them?”
Julienne Brown, 26, and Jacob Kish, 25, who live in Los Angeles with an overweight Savannah cat named Dude who suffers from arthritis pain, attended the panel discussion. Kish said they will now look into treating Dude with CBD.

""This is the first I've heard that this is an option,"" Kish said. ""So we're really excited.""

1617,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 07:51AM ET</span>",'Communist' Frida Kahlo swept up in debate on cultural change in Hungary,"By Krisztina Than
BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Sixty-four years after her death, the personal life and politics of Frida Kahlo have come under scrutiny in Hungary. 
A right-wing pro-government newspaper has criticized a hugely popular exhibition of her work at the Hungarian National Gallery in Budapest for ""promoting communism"".
The criticism comes as part of a wider national debate on culture and cultural policy since nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban won a third consecutive mandate in April. 
Orban's supporters and pro-government journalists have argued in the past weeks that after Orban won another strong mandate, it was now time for a shift in culture towards conservative values to end what they call a dominance of leftist-liberal artists.
In a July 14 article entitled ""This is the way communism is promoted using state money"", the Kahlo exhibition was listed in the right-wing newspaper Magyar Idok along with some other galleries, artists and exhibitions.
""You won't believe it but Trotsky has emerged in Budapest again, this time from Frida Kahlo's bed,"" the newspaper wrote, referring to her affair with Leon Trotsky, a key figure in the Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia, during his later exile in Mexico. Trotsky was assassinated in 1940.
Kahlo was affiliated with the communist Party of Mexico and is also said to have decorated the head of her bed with images of communist leaders Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, according to Mexico's Museo Frida Kahlo. 
The Kahlo exhibition, the international musical Billy Elliot and a string of gallery shows have found themselves under fire in a series of articles in the newspaper. 
The paper added there was ""no aesthetic problem"" with the exhibition of the ""Mexican communist painter"", which is drawing up to 3,000 visitors a day.
The National Gallery declined comment. Kahlo has become one of the twentieth century's most famous artists in the decades since her death, and her work draws huge interest.
The Budapest exhibition of paintings coincides with a Kahlo exhibition at London's Victoria & Albert Museum that focuses on her life story through personal artefacts.
NEW ERA
Galvanising the debate about cultural policy, Orban said on July 28 major changes lie ahead in this field and his third election victory was ""nothing short of a mandate to build a new era.""
""An era is determined by cultural trends, collective beliefs and social customs. This is now the task we are faced with: we must embed the political system in a cultural era,"" Orban told hundreds of supporters in a landmark speech.
A government spokesman declined comment when asked about the looming changes.
Since Orban was first elected in 2010, his Fidesz party has rewritten Hungary's constitution, gained control of state media, and businessmen close to Orban and Fidesz have built empires. 
Orban has successfully challenged western liberal taboos, winning the 2018 election with a strong anti-immigration campaign and by focusing on the importance of national pride and unity, and a ""strong Hungary"".
A group of around 60 artists and art historians signed a manifesto rejecting the listing of artists in Magyar Idok saying the attacks were unfounded.
In June, Magyar Idok also published an article by a guest commentator who accused the musical Billy Elliot in the Hungarian State Opera of spreading homosexual propaganda among its young audience. Billy Elliot has been on the program for two years, with over 100,000 viewers so far. 
The State Opera canceled 15 of 44 performances planned for June-July. 
It said in a statement on its website the performances had not been canceled because of the press controversy. But it noted people had lost interest in seeing the show following the coverage. 
Tamas Fricz, a right-wing political analyst who has helped organize mass rallies for Orban, said the aim was ""not to destroy liberal culture"" but to adjust the system to reflect the right-wing conservative political dominance, while also preserving the values of liberal arts.
""The autonomy of individual institutions should be preserved but I think the government ... has the right to firmly and consciously favor and support conservative thinking, artists, works of culture,"" Fricz said.
One way would be to channel more money to historical movies showing the grand chapters of Hungarian history, he said.

""A conservative culture must build itself ... which would show the historical strength of the Hungarian nation,"" he said.

1618,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 07:46AM ET</span>",Special Report: Dangerous News - How two young reporters shook Myanmar,"By Tom Lasseter
(Reuters) YANGON, Myanmar - Late in the afternoon of Dec. 12 last year, Wa Lone's cell phone rang. It was a man named Naing Lin, a lance corporal in Myanmar's 8th Security Police Battalion.
The policeman urged Wa Lone, a 31-year-old reporter with Reuters, to meet him immediately at the battalion's barracks on the outskirts of Yangon. Night was falling around the golden spires of the pagodas in this former capital city.
""He told me that if I don't come now,"" Wa Lone would later recall in a Myanmar courtroom, ""I might not be able to meet him because he is about to transfer to another region.""
Wa Lone, whose large eyeglasses rest on chubby cheeks, had spent weeks looking into Battalion 8. He was working on a story about the murder of 10 members of the country's Rohingya Muslim minority during a military operation in western Rakhine State. And he'd gotten his hands on explosive material: photographs of the 10 men before and after they were killed.
One picture showed the men's bodies, hacked and shot to death, in a shallow grave. Another, taken while they were still alive, showed them on their knees. In the background, milling around with assault rifles, were members of Battalion 8.
Before going to meet the lance corporal, Wa Lone checked in with the Reuters bureau chief, Antoni Slodkowski, who told him to take another reporter along. That man, 27-year-old Kyaw Soe Oo, was visiting from Rakhine State and had recently been hired by the news agency.
Setting out at about 6 p.m., the bureau's white Nissan SUV crossed an overpass that overlooks Inya Lake, ringed by homes of Myanmar's elite, including the nation's de facto leader, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. It was a world beyond the reach of Wa Lone, the son of a rice farmer from a village of a few hundred people.
About halfway to the Battalion 8 compound, the SUV was stuck in traffic. Wa Lone later remembered feeling uneasy: Why had the policeman insisted on him coming right away? The reporters discussed turning around. But they decided to push on.
Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo made it to the entrance of Battalion 8 around 8 p.m. After meeting Lance Corporal Naing Lin and a second policeman, the reporters said in court, they went with the cops down the street to an open-air beer garden. The men ordered beer and fish crackers. They talked about Rakhine State, Naing Lin recalled in court testimony. He told the reporters about coming under attack by Rohingya insurgents on Aug. 25 last year, as the militants launched a series of assaults on police stations.
When it was time to go, Wa Lone later said in court, Naing Lin handed him a copy of the Myanmar Alin, a state-run newspaper, rolled up with some documents inside. As the two reporters left the restaurant, they were surrounded by men in civilian clothes. ""These are secret documents!"" Wa Lone recalled one man shouting. A pair of handcuffs was slapped on Wa Lone's wrists, and another on Kyaw Soe Oo's. They were then pulled into two parked cars.
Naing Lin recalls the encounter differently. He testified in court that Wa Lone called him on Dec. 12 to request a meeting, and that when he met the two reporters at the beer garden, he came alone. He also denied giving Wa Lone any documents.
With their arrest, the two reporters were thrust into the murky confluence of military and civilian rule in this ethnically fractured nation of some 50 million people. To dignitaries in Western capitals, from Pope Francis to former U.S. President Bill Clinton, their incarceration would become a test of press freedom in Myanmar, and how far the country has traveled toward a more open society. On July 9, a judge charged the two under the Official Secrets Act, a law that carries a maximum sentence of 14 years.
At the beginning of this decade, Myanmar was a focus of hopes for democratic progress in Southeast Asia, a neighborhood long marked by strongman regimes. Aung San Suu Kyi was released in 2010 after about 15 years of house arrest under a military government. In 2015, her party swept general elections.
For the youth of Myanmar, like Wa Lone, that sharp turn of events brought a sudden, historically improbable expectation of freedom after decades of brutal military rule. But the army never fully relinquished power: In 2008, it put in place a constitution granting itself broad powers and control of key ministries.
And peace has not come to Myanmar. Deadly ethnic conflicts, obscure to most of the world but bloody at home, have continued to rumble.
Last year, widespread enmity for the country's best-known ethnic minority, the Rohingya Muslims, fed a savage military campaign that forced some 700,000 people to flee their homes for Bangladesh. Now, the Myanmar army stands accused by United Nations officials of having committed widespread killings, mass rape and ethnic cleansing. In the face of this condemnation, Suu Kyi has not uttered a word of public criticism of the armed forces.
A spokesman for Aung San Suu Kyi, Zaw Htay, and an Army spokesman did not respond to requests for comment for this article. Zaw Htay has said that Myanmar's courts are independent and the reporters are receiving a fair trial. The military has denied its troops took part in ethnic cleansing in Rakhine State last year.
Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo's reporting on the massacre of the 10 Rohingya men was published by Reuters in February. The article placed them at odds with their country's Buddhist majority, to which the reporters, Aung San Suu Kyi and top military leaders all belong. Much of that majority despises the Rohingya, viewing them as foreign interlopers from South Asia. It was groundbreaking investigative journalism in Myanmar. But to their own people, the reporters' quest for truth was an act of betrayal.
The pair have been behind bars for almost eight months, most of that time at Yangon's Insein Prison, a hulking edifice of 19th century British colonial architecture that has held thousands of political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi herself for a brief period. And they have been appearing in court since January, sitting through more than 30 hearings. A verdict in their trial could be handed down in the coming weeks.
The story of the two reporters and their roles in Myanmar's experiment with press freedom is pieced together from their testimony and that of police at their trial. It also draws on other accounts given by Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo and interviews with their colleagues, their relatives and their friends.
The day after their arrest, an order was issued from the office of the nation's then-president authorizing police to pursue charges against the two reporters. Then, for two weeks, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo disappeared without a trace into the hands of the police.
THE MAKING OF A NON-CONFORMIST
Wa Lone's collision with the state was, in many ways, a long time coming.
He grew up in a traditional wood clapboard house, built by his grandfather in the small village of Kin Pyit, with a population of less than 500. Reached by a skinny dirt road, the village is an island among outstretched rice paddies.
When Wa Lone was a boy, his father, a rice farmer named Tin Myint, needed to borrow money before planting. At harvest season, he was forced to sell a quota of his rice below market price to the local military administration. ""It was not enough, we had to take out loans to plant the next crop,"" said Wa Lone's younger brother, Thura Aung.
Money was tight. Meals were usually rice with vegetables, rarely with the added expense of meat, said Thura Aung.
Wa Lone was unwilling to accept such frustrations, Tin Myint said. ""He was really impatient. He always said, 'Where is the improvement? How are we going to improve our lives if we keep going like this?'"" he said.
Wa Lone traveled to Yangon in 2004, the country's former capital and still its main city, and got a job in a welding shop. The pay was bad and he didn't know much about welding. ""They treated us like – I wouldn't say slaves, but something like that,"" is how Wa Lone describes the experience.
A few months later, he moved to Mawlamyine, a smaller city about a six-hour drive from Yangon. It sits near the shores of the Andaman Sea, and he had an uncle who lived at a neighborhood monastery there.
His mother died of breast cancer at the end of 2005, but Wa Lone didn't receive word until two months after her death, when a monk from his village visited the monastery and passed on the news. The first job he got in Mawlamyine was unloading vegetables at a night market. He was still a teenager.
While living in the city, Wa Lone and four friends began hanging out after work at a large monastery down the street from his uncle. It had a reading room, a project funded by the British Embassy and British Council to stock libraries with English books in cities across Myanmar. The group took an English language class for a while, but mostly they read books and talked.
In 2007, Wa Lone and his friends followed news reports as protests gripped the nation. Known as the Saffron Revolution, the uprising included long processions of Buddhist monks taking to the streets in defiance of the military junta. The junta cracked down, reportedly killing at least 31 people and arresting thousands.
In 2009, Wa Lone heard about other young people from Myanmar meeting in Thailand to discuss democracy. He spent more than two months there with them, talking about political theory and reading books such as George Orwell's ""Animal Farm."" Wa Lone watched documentaries about protest movements – the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, the American Civil Rights movement, the struggle against apartheid in South Africa.
Wa Lone said he returned to Mawlamyine inspired to do more for the people of his country. He didn't want to get arrested or confront the authorities – both, he reasoned, would be bad for his family. He continued with volunteer work and charity drives to fund monastery schools.
Around him, the nation's politics were changing. Aung San Suu Kyi was released in 2010. The military junta installed a quasi-civilian regime led by ex-generals the next year. The decision by Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy, to contest by-elections in 2012 was thrilling, said Kyaw Naing Oo, one of the circle of friends in Mawlamyine. Now in his mid-thirties, he runs a charity school.
""At the time of the election we really hoped for more freedom because it was a democratic party,"" said Kyaw Naing Oo, ""and Aung San Suu Kyi is a democratic icon.""
In a monastery where Wa Lone stayed in Mawlamyine, a small house at the end of an alley, another member of his family recently received visitors. Aww Bar Sa, who is a monk and Wa Lone's second cousin, gestured for the reporters to follow him upstairs. A golden Buddha sat in a shrine, with flashing red, blue and green LED lights all around.
As boys of the same age, Wa Lone and Aww Bar Sa grew up together in Kin Pyit village. ""Since he was young he would argue about whether the world is round or flat, or whether the world is moving or standing still,"" Aww Bar Sa said, laughing at the memories of Wa Lone. ""He would argue about such things. Many in the village did not understand these topics.""
Asked about Wa Lone's journalism, Aww Bar Sa grew more solemn.
""The country's development is still slow. People don't have much knowledge yet. There are still many superstitions,"" said Aww Bar Sa. ""So, if you don't write from the side of your own religion, they think of you as a traitor.""
That sentiment is evident in the comments posted on a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page set up by Reuters – ""Free Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo"" – after the arrests. The page has photographs of Kyaw Soe Oo, in handcuffs, hugging his two-year-old daughter. There's Wa Lone beside his pregnant wife, and his wife without him, crying. Below, visitors posted a string of slurs and threats.
""They are traitors""
""They are disgusting""
""They should be given the death sentence""
The Rohingya aren't afforded citizenship. Their very ethnicity is not recognized by Myanmar officialdom. Many of the Rohingya still in the country live in isolated colonies that are a cross between shanty towns and internment camps. They are, according to Human Rights Watch, ""one of the largest stateless populations in the world.""
""I don't use the word 'Rohingya',"" says Aye Chan, a nationalist activist from Rakhine State who is now promoting the settlement of Buddhists in the areas where the Rohingya lived before they fled. ""They are Bengalis. They're from Bangladesh.""
Aye Chan socialized with Aung San Suu Kyi when both were studying in Japan in the 1980s, and he himself was jailed for seven years for supporting democratic reform during the junta era. Seated in the lobby of Yangon's Lotte Hotel, with a view of Inya Lake outside, he spelled out his take on the current crisis.
He visited abandoned Muslim villages days after the Rohingya fled, which he said put him in a position to dispel allegations of mass rape and other atrocities by Myanmar soldiers. As evidence, he cited meeting with an officer in the area. ""I asked one of the border police, an officer, 'There are accusations about you of raping these women?' He laughed. And he said: 'These women don't bath even once in a week. How can we sleep with them?'""
In Aung San Suu Kyi's speeches, she avoids the term ""Rohingya"" in favor of ""Muslims,"" a word that denotes religion but not homeland.
Sitting down at a hotel restaurant in the capital city of Naypyitaw, an aide to Aung San Suu Kyi spoke in support of her.
The situation inside Myanmar, behind closed doors, is more nuanced than it might appear to outsiders who urge Aung San Suu Kyi to speak out on behalf of the Rohingya, said Sean Turnell, an Australian academic who serves as her special economic consultant.
""'Nobel Prize winner overseeing genocide' is a damn good headline, I get it,"" he said.
But under the 2008 constitution, the military is ""completely beyond the control of the civilian government,"" said Turnell. The civilian government ""has no de jure supervision and no de facto supervision. At all. Zero.""
More than that, Myanmar's constitution provides that if a state of emergency is declared, the commander-in-chief can be granted total control of the country under circumstances including ""disintegration of national solidarity.""
TESTING THE LIMITS OF PRESS FREEDOM
Slodkowski, the Reuters bureau chief, first met Wa Lone in 2016.
Wa Lone didn't speak English as well as another candidate Slodkowski was interviewing: ""I had trouble understanding everything he said."" But Wa Lone struck him as both curious and driven.
That was important to Slodkowski, who had been coming to Myanmar since 2009. Slodkowski's father was an underground journalist in Poland who was arrested in 1982 and spent a year and a half in prison under an authoritarian communist regime.
Wa Lone soon landed a job at Reuters. He'd been in Yangon for about six years at that point, doing charity work, taking English classes and working his way through a series of local newspapers.
He met the woman who became his wife, Pan Ei Mon, at one of them, the Myanmar Times. The first time they went for coffee, in 2013, Wa Lone asked Pan Ei Mon whether she had a boyfriend. She said that she did. ""He said, 'Okay, why don't you choose between him and me,'"" she recalled, smiling at the memory.
Before joining Reuters, he'd built a reputation for reporting about the country's internal armed conflicts. At the Myanmar Times, where he worked for about three years, Wa Lone was one of the first reporters to reach an embattled border region in Shan State after a bout of fighting in 2015 between the military and an armed ethnic militia.
Such violence has a long history in Myanmar. Civil warfare began almost immediately after independence in 1948. Ethnic divisions that erupted in fighting back then have endured. More than 20 armed groups pose a central challenge for Aung San Suu Kyi and her government, who are pursuing national peace talks. To the north of Shan State, for example, among jade, amber and gold mines, it is the Kachin Independence Army trading fire with government troops.
After arriving at Reuters, Wa Lone soon began reporting about Rakhine State and the Rohingya Muslims. A story in October 2016 detailed allegations that Myanmar soldiers raped eight Rohingya women at gunpoint after coordinated Rohingya insurgent attacks on border posts. With Wa Lone's name atop, the story quoted a Rohingya woman saying of a group of soldiers: ""Two men held me, one holding each arm, and another one held me by my hair from the back and they raped me."" Government spokesman Zaw Htay denied the allegations when the story was published.
Wa Lone covered attacks by Rohingya Muslim militants as well. In August of 2017, he reported on official accounts of coordinated assaults by the militants on 30 police posts and an army base, killing 12 members of the country's security forces. Those attacks would spark the military's crackdown in Rakhine State.
The reporting traced a pattern in Rakhine in which insurgent strikes on security forces were met with overwhelming force that drove increasing numbers of Rohingya Muslims to flee the area.
Wa Lone pursued his job while facing difficulties making ends meet. His wife, Pan Ei Mon, said Wa Lone made the equivalent of $1,000 a month at Reuters, and she earned about $380 working in the advertising department of a local newspaper. Wa Lone's annual income alone was about 10 times the country's per capita gross national income. But living in the center of Yangon, Pan Ei Mon said, ""It was never enough.""
They lived in a small apartment, a space subdivided from their landlady's house. With Reuters headquarters often slow to reimburse their expenses in the far-off Yangon bureau, reporters there said they sometimes ran out of money after long trips before the next check. Both Pan Ei Mon and Wa Lone pawned their wedding rings. They used an older friend at the Myanmar Times to take the jewelry to avoid embarrassment, said Pan Ei Mon. On one occasion, Wa Lone used the cash to help pay for a reporting trip to Rakhine State.
Asked about its slowness to pay expenses in Yangon, Reuters said its global system for reimbursing reporters depends on using a credit card that isn't widely accepted in Myanmar. In recent months, the news agency said in a written statement, it has made it possible for staff there to be reimbursed more frequently. On the pawning of the wedding rings, Reuters said: ""We were not aware of this personal sacrifice and it is not something we would ever ask or expect of staff.""
In investigating the massacre, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were on dangerous ground, said Myat Swe, co-founder of the Myanmar Times. He was arrested in 2004 by the military junta after his father, an intelligence officer, was purged. He spent about nine years behind bars for allegedly violating censorship laws. ""What they did was they threw me in the prison first and then they looked for the case,"" said Myat Swe, now chief executive at Frontier Myanmar magazine.
The military, he said, retains vast power, which Aung San Suu Kyi is unable to check. ""You can clearly see that she doesn't have any influence whatsoever on the military,"" said Myat Swe, sitting in a second-floor office where production notes for his magazine were scribbled on glass walls.
That made Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo's reporting ""quite risky,"" he said, especially in Rakhine State, where the government is aware of reporters' movements and locals don't like journalists, domestic or foreign.
Under the junta, which lasted half a century, Myanmar had what was regarded as one of the world's strictest systems of censorship. After the junta installed a quasi-civilian government, the country announced in 2012 that it was ending pre-publication censorship of news reports. Later that year, it said that private daily newspapers, shut down since 1964, could be published.
A fitful loosening and tightening followed – 10 journalists and media executives were imprisoned in 2014, for example. As Aung San Suu Kyi's party took power in 2016, expectations rose that she would introduce an era of greater press freedom.
But journalists continue to be incarcerated. In June last year, the military arrested three Myanmar reporters in Shan State for covering a drug-burning event by an ethnic militia. They were charged under the Unlawful Associations Act, a colonial-era law that broadly prohibits contact with banned groups. The charges were dropped in September.
Former Reuters journalist Aung Hla Tun knows what it is like to cover the military. Ushering visitors into his office in Naypyitaw, he pointed to an internal Reuters reporting award on a shelf which he won for covering the Saffron Revolution protests in 2007. ""I got a chance to do my bit for democracy, for freedom of press for Myanmar,"" he said.
That year, he produced a series of reports from the streets as protesters defied the junta. In an internal Reuters note circulated in October of 2007, Aung Hla Tun was praised for displaying ""enormous courage, resourcefulness and journalistic integrity in putting us consistently ahead on the major breaks and turns in the story.""
He is no longer a reporter. Aung Hla Tun left Reuters at the end of 2016 and was named Myanmar's deputy information minister in January 2018. He said he chose to serve in the government out of loyalty to Aung San Suu Kyi.
Sitting on a sofa, dressed like a typical Myanmar official in a traditional sarong-like garment called a longyi, with neatly combed hair, glasses and placid expression, he recounted the stories of his own family members arrested by the former military regime.
He also talked about Wa Lone.
Aung Hla Tun worked with Wa Lone briefly in the Reuters bureau and knew him before that as a member of the reporting community in Yangon. While at the Myanmar Times, Wa Lone said he attended sessions that Aung Hla Tun hosted for journalists looking to brush up their English and improve their time management.
They considered each other friends. Aung Hla Tun attended Wa Lone's wedding in 2016. A snapshot from the day shows him on stage, a place of honor, with the beaming couple.
But Wa Lone said he and Aung Hla Tun disagreed over coverage of events in Rakhine State. At one point, Aung Hla Tun said, he gave Wa Lone advice: ""be careful.""
The prior Reuters bureau chief in Yangon, Paul Mooney, said Aung Hla Tun referred to Rohingya Muslims as ""Bengalis,"" a term implying they are foreigners that's commonly used in Myanmar. When Buddhists attacked Muslims during riots in the city of Mandalay in 2014, Mooney said, Aung Hla Tun only wanted to relay official comment from the capital. ""If there was anything negative that might kind of make the Burmese army look bad, he didn't want to be involved with it,"" Mooney said.
Aung Hla Tun disputed Mooney's descriptions of him. Mooney, he said, tried to paint him as ""anti-Muslim."" However, he said, ""I have many Muslim friends.""
Aung Hla Tun said he had asked officials in the government about Wa Lone's case. But, Aung Hla Tun said, he discovered that it was inadvisable to lobby for Wa Lone's release: ""Some close friends warned me, 'You should stop or you will be in danger.'"" He did not explain further.
""I have done my best, he was my friend,"" he said.
His voice strained as he spoke about the news agency's coverage of Rakhine State. ""Reuters should have apologized to the government. Apologize!""
A MASS GRAVE IS DISCOVERED
In late October, Wa Lone flew to Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine. He was with a colleague, reporter Simon Lewis; the two met up with Kyaw Soe Oo after landing.
Where Wa Lone's face is full and his eyes animated above a mustache, Kyaw Soe Oo has high cheekbones, his shoulders square on a leaner frame. As a kid in Sittwe, he helped out local shops arranging and dusting books, and in return was allowed to read them. As an adult, he stacked bookshelves from floor to ceiling in his home. He read the translated works of names like Kafka, Camus, Sartre.
His family owned boats and buses used to transport goods. When Kyaw Soe Oo told them he was going to marry a woman who worked as a household employee for his grandmother, they disapproved. He married her anyway.
His wife, Chit Su Win, complained about all the books he was buying, and Kyaw Soe Oo agreed not to add any more. ""But then I bought more and lied to her, saying that I got those from my friends,"" he said.
In 2012, riots exploded between Muslims and Buddhists in Rakhine State. Growing up in Sittwe, the state capital, Kyaw Soe Oo was a Buddhist living among Muslims his whole life. A family helper who prepared his school lunches was Muslim. In the aftermath of the 2012 unrest, he'd watched in dismay as Rakhine Buddhists ""bullied"" Muslims.
Kyaw Soe Oo said he felt compelled to report about the issue. ""To be frank, I would rather be a property agent than a reporter,"" he said. ""But if we don't solve this problem during my time, my daughter will suffer the consequences.""
After his arrest, his wife, Chit Su Win, moved to Yangon from Rakhine State. She says she's now concerned it is unsafe to return. Many in the Buddhist majority back home in Sittwe were furious that Kyaw Soe Oo had helped a reporting effort about crimes against Muslims. He and Wa Lone have received a torrent of death threats on social media since their arrest.
""Because of the story, people in Rakhine really do not like my husband now,"" she said of the massacre article.
While Lewis conducted interviews in Sittwe last October, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo took a ferry and got motorbike taxis to head further into the state's interior. On the way, Kyaw Soe Oo's driver mentioned that 10 Muslim men had been killed in the area. He and Wa Lone switched rides so that Wa Lone could hear the details. As they cut past rice paddies, the wind whipping in their faces, the driver leaned back and shouted answers. There'd been 10 men killed by soldiers and a group of villagers with swords, he said.
The news was related in a matter-of-fact way. ""He doesn't like Muslims,"" Wa Lone later explained. ""I don't think he thought this is a big crime – an issue of morality or something.""
They arrived at the village, called Inn Din, and others there repeated the story.
Lewis remembers Wa Lone calling him and saying: ""These guys are telling us there is a grave and they are offering to show us. I'm not sure if we should do that."" Lewis added: ""He was scared.""
The grave was hard to find. The reporters walked through bushes and noticed newly cut branches marking a path on the side of a hill. There were barely buried bones on the ground, said Wa Lone. There were other bones scattered nearby. Wa Lone thought to himself that a dog may have been gnawing on them.
During his trip, a villager gave Wa Lone a photograph of 10 Rohingya men kneeling with more than a dozen men behind them, many holding assault rifles. The 10 had been detained by security forces.
After returning to Yangon, Wa Lone obtained another picture. This one showed the bodies of the 10 Rohingya men in a shallow grave. It was the same men, in the same t-shirts, but now some were face down in the dirt, limbs splayed, others with mouths agape toward the heavens, and blood everywhere.
In the photograph of the men kneeling, there's a man at the back left corner of the frame with a ball cap on backwards and holding a gun with what looked like the number eight written in Burmese on the stock. It was a clue: At least some of the men in the image belonged to Myanmar's police battalion 8 – the same battalion as that of Lance Corporal Naing Lin, the man Wa Lone would later meet on the evening of Dec. 12.
Wa Lone, said Slodkowski, grew ""obsessed"" with identifying the policemen in the photograph. At the time, the United Nations was alleging widespread abuses by the military in Rakhine State; the government responded by saying it would look into any evidence presented to it.
""Let's give them evidence then,"" Slodkowski recalls Wa Lone saying.
Wa Lone devised ways to meet Battalion 8 police members so he could ask for phone numbers of other officers. He plugged those numbers into the search bar of Facebook, which is wildly popular in Myanmar, said Slodkowski. He looked for faces that matched those in the background of the photograph of the 10 Rohingya men.
Wa Lone also printed an enlargement of at least one face from among the armed men standing behind the kneeling Rohingya, said Slodkowski. Wa Lone took the image to other officers of Battalion 8 and asked whether they recognized their comrade.
His pursuit of the members of Battalion 8 would ultimately land him in jail, according to testimony in his trial.
A Battalion 8 captain named Moe Yan Naing testified that the police planned to ""entrap"" Wa Lone. He said he was present when a police brigadier general told Naing Lin to call Wa Lone, arrange the meeting and plant documents on the reporter before arresting him.
The brigadier general, he testified, issued a blunt threat to the cops: ""If you don't get Wa Lone, you will go to jail.""
After saying so in court, Moe Yan Naing was sentenced to a year in prison for violating police discipline, a development that police said was unrelated to his testimony.
The prosecution also presented police witnesses who backed the official version of events: They said the two reporters were detained, already in possession of the documents, during a random search at a police checkpoint.
'SHUT YOUR MOUTH'
On the night of their arrests, Kyaw Soe Oo said, he didn't realize the men in plainclothes who surrounded Wa Lone were police. He was going to help Wa Lone but then was grabbed from behind. ""I thought they were pickpockets,"" Kyaw Soe Oo later testified.
At the police station, Wa Lone testified, the two reporters were confronted by more than a dozen men in uniform and plainclothes. One asked Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo if they were spies. When Wa Lone said he didn't know what was in the documents Naing Lin had handed him, a cop replied: ""Shut your mouth.""
Next, both reporters later testified, they were taken to a building not far from downtown Yangon. It was the Aung Tha Pyay interrogation center, a nondescript building where special branch police officers do their work.
Wa Lone said the police pulled a fabric sack over his head on the way there. He was then picked up by his armpits and carried up a set of stairs. When the sack was pulled off, there were officers sitting behind a table in front of him.
The interrogators, Wa Lone told the court, already had a list of the policemen he'd spoken to. They demanded he answer the same questions, over and over, in two-hour sessions, for almost three days straight: What did the policemen of Battalion 8 tell him? What was he reporting on?
In those sleepless days of interrogation, Wa Lone told the court, the police pressured him to share his cell phone password. He resisted. The phone, he knew, contained something that would grab the attention of the police: the photographs of the 10 Muslim men. But he was tired ""from hours of continuous interrogations,"" he testified. And he was scared things could get worse if he didn't relent. So he gave up the code. Before that moment, Wa Lone said, ""We did not talk about the killings in Inn Din.""
One officer, he told the court, offered ""possible negotiations"" if Reuters would agree not to publish the story. Wa Lone said he rejected the overture.
His interrogators also berated him for having looked into the killings.
""They said, 'You are both Buddhists. Why are you writing about 'kalars' at a time like this?'"" Wa Lone testified, quoting a derogatory Burmese term many use to describe people of South Asian descent, especially Muslims.
Kyaw Soe Oo described coming under similar pressure. At one point, he testified, an interrogator burst into his cell to ask about the photographs of the 10 doomed men from Inn Din: ""Why haven't you told us about this?"" the interrogator said. Kyaw Soe Oo said he was then made to kneel on the floor for at least three hours as punishment.
Another time, Kyaw Soe Oo testified, a military intelligence officer brought print-outs of the photos and asked whether he had ""sent the photos from my phone to human rights organizations from foreign countries.""
Captain Myint Lwin, the officer in charge of the Yangon police station that conducted the preliminary inquiry after the reporters' arrests, denied in court that Kyaw Soe Oo was made to kneel during his questioning. He also said that neither reporter was transferred to Aung Tha Pyay interrogation center. Calls to a police spokesman seeking comment about the reporters' testimony went unanswered.
When Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were arrested, their story about the massacre had yet to be completed. Their colleagues Lewis and Slodkowski finished the piece over the following two months. Wa Lone's wife, Pan Ei Mon, whose pregnancy was advancing while her husband sat in prison, said in an interview that she was against running it. Pan Ei Mon had been speaking with a Myanmar government official who told her he was concerned Wa Lone ""would be made an example of.""
The story established that soldiers were among those who killed the Rohingya in Inn Din village, and Pan Ei Mon thought that publishing would shut off any sympathetic channels in the government.
Wa Lone took a different view. He told a Reuters lawyer he wanted the story to run. It appeared in early February.
""After that story was released, I decided not to visit Wa Lone anymore,"" Pan Ei Mon said. ""I thought all he cared about was his ego – not me or the baby inside me."" The next day, she relented and went to see him.
Wa Lone received other visitors after the story ran. Several senior police officers met him in a room at the prison and videotaped the interview, he testified at his trial. Among the officers, he said, was the brigadier general who, according to earlier court testimony by Capt. Moe Yan Naing, gave the order to set up and arrest the Reuters reporters. The brigadier general asked Wa Lone to reveal the sources for the Inn Din story. Wa Lone said he refused to give up any names.
He and Kyaw Soe Oo have been in jail for 240 days. On April 11 they had yet another court appearance. It was Wa Lone's 32nd birthday. The day before, the military announced that seven soldiers were sentenced to 10 years in prison with hard labor for participating in the Inn Din massacre. With that, Myanmar's generals appeared to be acknowledging the truth of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo's reporting about the killings in Inn Din.
The tailgate of a police truck opened to let out the police officers guarding Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo. Pan Ei Mon was waiting, brushing her hair back from her face with a wide smile. She was about five months pregnant.
In the passageway where she stood, there was a birthday cake on a chair. The group of more than half a dozen policemen let Wa Lone pause to blow out the candles. He walked into the courtroom grinning.
Inside, the judge declined a motion by the defense to dismiss the case against the reporters. Wa Lone's wife wept. Kyaw Soe Oo's wife wept.
On his way out of the courtroom, Wa Lone paused and shouted at the cameras pointing at him. ""The culprits who committed the massacre were sentenced to 10 years in prison. However, the ones who reported on it – us – are accused under a law that can get us imprisoned for 14 years,"" he said. ""So, I'd like to ask the government: Where is the truth? Where is the truth and justice? Where is democracy and freedom?""
The police then led him and Kyaw Soe Oo into the back of the truck. Its tailgate clanged shut. And they were gone.

The nomination is expected to end Slovenia's longest political stalemate since an election.
The anti-immigrant Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) of former Prime Minister Janez Jansa, the strongest single party in the parliament with 25 seats, could not find a coalition partner to form the government. 
Under Slovenian law, lawmakers may nominate candidates for prime minister if the president fails to name a candidate because no party holds a majority in parliament [nL5N1UJ2A5].
The parliament is due to vote on Sarec's nomination on Aug. 17. He would need support of an absolute majority -- at least 46 out of 90 parliamentary members -- to be elected.
Sarec is a former actor and comedian whose second term as mayor of Kamnik in northern Slovenia expired this year.
His LMS party has agreed a minority coalition with the Social Democrats, the Party of Modern Centre, the Party of ex-Prime Minister Alenka Bratusek SAB and pensioners' party Desus.
The coalition also expects to get the backing of the Left party, though it earlier said it would not participate in the government.
The five parties together hold 43 seats, and with the Left's nine seats they expect to secure a slim majority in the parliament. If confirmed, Sarec will have 15 days to nominate his cabinet. 

One of the first tasks of the new government would be to start the sale of Slovenia's largest bank, state-owned Nova Ljubljanska Banka. Slovenia has committed to sell a 75 percent stake in NLB in exchange for European Commission approval of state aid to the bank in 2013.

1620,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 07:41AM ET</span>","Philippines' Duterte 'hates gambling', rules out new casinos","MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte said on Wednesday there would be no new casinos set up during his presidency, a day after abruptly shelving Landing International's $1.5 billion integrated casino project in Manila.
The Philippines is one of Asia's fastest-growing gambling markets and its integrated casino-resorts have helped create jobs and generate tax and tourism revenue. It also benefits from bans on gambling in many Southeast Asia nations.
Duterte on Tuesday ordered a review of Landing's contract on the same day it broke ground on its project, arguing it put the government at a disadvantage because the rental payment was too cheap and the lease too long.
He reiterated his longstanding opposition to gambling and said he wanted no new casinos.
""I hate gambling. I do not want it,"" Duterte said during a public speech, without elaborating. ""There will be no casinos outside of what are existing. I am not granting anything.""
The notoriously blunt Duterte ordered the gaming operator in January to stop accepting new applications in a bid to prevent overcrowding in the sector and manage its growth.
At the end of last year, there were nine private casino firms in the Philippines operating 1,444 gaming tables and 9,427 electronic gaming machines, according to government data.
Gross gaming revenues rose 11.6 percent to 176.5 billion pesos ($3.33 billion) last year.
Since the halt in new applications, two foreign firms, Macau's Galaxy Entertainment Group and Landing, have secured provisional gaming licenses.
It was not immediately clear whether other applications submitted prior to January and pending approval would be impacted.
Officials of the gaming regulator were not immediately available for comment.
Landing said on Wednesday it has nothing to add to its statement issued on Tuesday, which said the integrated resort project was pushing through and its lease contract was valid.

The Iranian economy is beset by high unemployment, a spiraling rial, which has lost half its value since April, and the reimposition of sanctions by the United States.
A total of 129 members of parliament voted that Rabiei be impeached and removed from office, state media said, with 111 members voting in favor of him remaining.  
In late July, President Hassan Rouhani’s cabinet appointed a new governor for the central bank, a move seen as a concession to hardline critics who blame the government for economic problems.
Protests linked to the tough economic situation in the country began last December, spreading to more than 80 cities and towns and resulting in 25 deaths.
Sporadic protests, led by truck drivers, farmers and merchants in Tehran’s bazaar, have continued regularly since then and have occasionally resulted in violent confrontations with security forces.

1622,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 07:20AM ET</span>",China offers further evidence secretive annual leadership meet is happening,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese state media on Wednesday offered further evidence that a secretive annual conclave of senior leaders is being held at the seaside resort of Beidaihe, saying that Premier Li Keqiang had met a United Nations official there.
Traditionally top party leaders visit the town every summer on an unofficial retreat to discuss personnel moves and policy ideas behind closed doors.
Li and President Xi Jinping have not appeared on the main evening news since the start of the month, as opposed to almost daily appearances normally, suggesting they may have been in Beidaihe.
The government typically does not confirm the Beidaihe meetings are happening, with the only clues coming from state media dispatches datelined Beidaihe about often quite mundane events, rather than describing the leadership discussions.
In a brief dispatch, state radio said Li had met United Nations General Assembly President Maria Fernanda Espinosa in Beidaihe, where the two discussed the need to promote free trade, against the backdrop of China's trade war with the United States.
Over the weekend, state media had also said Chen Xi, who as head of the Organisation Department oversees the ruling Communist Party's personnel decisions, had been told by Xi to visit ""vacationing experts"" in Beidaihe. It said Vice Premier Hu Chunhua had accompanied Chen.
Sources with ties to the leadership and foreign diplomats have told Reuters the Beidaihe meeting was likely in early August.
Beidaihe, about two hours east of Beijing by high-speed train, is steeped in party history, though sources with ties to the leadership say Xi is not a fan of the place.
Its beginnings date from the late 19th century, as a resort for Western missionaries and traders to escape the summer heat, though few buildings from those days still stand.
After the communist takeover in 1949, it became a venue for leaders to relax with family and talk in private with peers.

The founder of modern China, Mao Zedong, was particularly fond of it, and his calligraphy of a poem he composed there is displayed around the town.

1623,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 06:30AM ET</span>",African migrants protest in Italy after road deaths,"By Crispian Balmer
FOGGIA, Italy (Reuters) - Migrant laborers staged a strike on Wednesday to protest at the deaths of 16 colleagues killed this week in two separate traffic accidents in southern Italy.
Thousands of migrants work in the southern heel of Italy during the summer months, harvesting tomatoes. 
They are paid as little as 3 euros ($3.50) an hour, less than half the minimum wage for agricultural workers, and many have to live in shanty towns without water or electricity.
Twelve migrants died on Monday as they traveled home after a day in the fields, with their packed van smashing head-on into an on-coming lorry. 
Two days earlier, four migrants died in a near identical accident. Both crashes happened close to the city of Foggia, near the Adriatic coast.
More than 200 migrants marched on Foggia from their camp, known as the ""Great Ghetto"", some 10 km (6 miles) away.
""No to slavery,"" they chanted as they walked along country roads under a fierce summer sun.
The protesters, most from sub-Sahara Africa, say their work is unregulated, allowing unscrupulous bosses to take advantage, packing them into over-crowded vans and driving them from one farm to another without any type of contract.
""We are treated like slaves but we don't have any option,"" said Ibrahim Sissoko, 28, from Mali, who arrived in Italy in 2015.
""There is no other work here for us and they know it, so they take advantage.""

The Italian government promised this week to crack down on labor abuses, but similar pledges in the past have come to nothing.

1624,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 06:24AM ET</span>",Israeli prison to join Armageddon's list of ancient ruins,"By Stephen Farrell
MEGIDDO, Israel (Reuters) - The end is nigh at Armageddon - at least for an old Israeli prison near the ancient ruins of Megiddo, by tradition the site of the apocalyptic Biblical battle between good and evil.
Half an hour's drive south of Nazareth, Armageddon is a popular site for the coach loads of tourists visiting the sites of the Holy Land. There is also a busy program of excavations.
In 2005, work to expand the aging Megiddo Prison uncovered the remains of a 3rd century Christian prayer hall, including a mosaic referring to ""God Jesus Christ"". 
The building with the mosaic was excavated, earlier artifacts found, and the site was covered up under the supervision of archaeologists. 
Now, after years of legal and bureaucratic delays, the prison is to be relocated, freeing up the site for further exploration potentially as early as 2021. 
The prospect already has archaeologists excitedly talking about an area they have started to call ""Greater Megiddo"". 
""When the Christian prayer hall was first found beneath the prison, we were all excited for one minute,"" said Matthew Adams, director of the W.F. Albright Institute of Archaeological Research in Jerusalem, who has spent years excavating at Megiddo.
""And then we realized, ""Oh, it's in a maximum security prison, so we'll never actually be able to do anything with it.""
""Now that the government has decided to move this prison, we can explore this really amazing and interesting part of the development of early Christianity in a way that we didn't think we'd be able to.""
The prison, whose inmates once included Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants, lies a few hundred yards south of Tel Megiddo itself, the ancient mound at which archeologist have found walls dating back at least 7,000 years.
Between the prison and the hill is the largely unexcavated Roman Sixth Legion garrison, thought to have been built by the Emperor Hadrian.
The name Armageddon is believed to be a corruption of the Hebrew words Har Megiddo - Mount Megiddo. 
Although small, the hill was the site of numerous ancient battles because it overlooks the Jezreel Valley, across which armies have marched since antiquity toward a pass leading to the Mediterranean.
The earliest written reference to Megiddo seems to have been during the reign of the Egyptian Pharaoh Thutmose III, who defeated Syrian and Canaanite states there in 1468 BC. It later fell to the Israelites, and then to the Assyrians in 733 BC.
In 1918, the British military commander General Edmund Allenby routed Turkish forces there and he later took the title Viscount Allenby of Megiddo and of Felixstowe.
But its fame derives principally from the apocalyptic final book of the New Testament, ""Revelation"", which tells of ""the battle of that great day of God Almighty...And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon"".
ANCIENT ROAD
The current dig at the mound is led by Adams and Prof. Israel Finkelstein, an Israeli archaeologist at Tel Aviv University.
""Megiddo was important because it sits on the international road which connects Egypt with Mesopotamia, with Damascus, with Anatolia. So whoever sits here controls the most important road of antiquity in the ancient world,"" Finkelstein said.
Their team has used modern radiocarbon dating and laser-assisted distance measurements to precisely date and record the many layers of history on the tel, including monuments once thought to have been built in the era of King Solomon.
These, Finkelstein says, can now be attributed to the later era of Ahab, king of the northern kingdom of Israel in the 9th century BC.
The most important things was to date things accurately.
""One way is to date according to Biblical verses, and one way is to date according to radiocarbon studies. Biblical verses, with all due respect, are always problematic because there are questions regarding their author, their goals, the ideology behind the author and so on and so forth.""
But, he said, ""when you work with radiocarbon you are on solid grounds in your dating"".
Israeli tourist authorities are planning a complex on the site to combine tourism, archaeology, and nature hikes. Targeting Christian evangelicals in particular, they hope to draw 300,000 visitors annually, nearly double the current figure.
Much work remains.
""A prison of 1,000 dangerous prisoners will be moved and a new complex will be built in order to expose the mosaic and enable people from all over the world to come,"" prison service spokeswoman Nicole Englander said.
Standing on Tel Megiddo as he supervised excavations into a Middle Bronze Age site, Adams said the area appears to have been a cultural melting pot two millennia ago, with Jews, Christians and pagan Romans all in the same spot. 
That suggested interaction between early Christians and the Roman Empire were much more complicated than previously thought.

""Typically, we think of the Romans persecuting Christians,"" he said.

1625,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 06:20AM ET</span>",Five charged with child abuse at New Mexico compound due in court,"TAOS, N.M. (Reuters) - Five people charged with felony child abuse were due to make their first court appearance on Wednesday after 11 children were found malnourished inside a ramshackle compound in northern New Mexico.
The defendants include the father of a missing boy whose disappearance led authorities to raid the compound last week. They also include another man and three women presumed to be the mothers of the 11 children, who were taken into protective custody.
On Monday, authorities found a body at the site believed to be the remains of the missing boy, whose abduction from his Georgia home has been reported by his mother in December. His body was discovered on what would have been the missing child's fourth birthday, the Taos County sheriff said on Tuesday.
Identification of the remains was awaiting an autopsy. Further charges in the case were possible, local prosecutor Donald Gallegos said.
The compound, surrounded by tires and a trench, is located on the outskirts of Amalia, New Mexico, near the Colorado state line, about 50 miles (80 km) north of Taos.
Each of the five adults were charged with 11 counts of felony child abuse, according to the local prosecutor, Donald Gallegos.
The missing boy's father, who the sheriff said was heavily armed when taken into custody, was identified as Siraj Wahhaj, 39. According to CNN, Wahhaj is himself the son of a prominent Muslim cleric of the same name in New York.
The second man has been alternatively identified by the sheriff as Lucas Morten and Lucan Morton.

The sheriff declined to answer questions about what was going on at the compound, but he said a shooting range had been built at the property.

Johnson, who resigned last month over the way May is negotiating Brexit, wrote in The Daily Telegraph this week that Denmark was wrong to ban the burqa, a head-to-toe cloak which conceals the face with a mesh or is worn in conjuction with the niqab - a face veil that leaves only the eyes exposed. 
But Johnson also said the robe was oppressive, ridiculous and made women look like letter boxes and bank robbers, prompting an outcry from other politicians and British Muslim groups. 
""I think Boris Johnson used language in describing people's appearance that has obviously caused offence. It was the wrong language to use. He should not have used it,"" May said.
She added that women should be free to wear the burqa if they chose to do so.

Full-face coverings such as niqabs and burqas are a polarising issue across Europe, with some arguing that they symbolise discrimination against women and should be outlawed. The clothing has already been banned in France.

1628,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 06:08AM ET</span>",Internet in eastern Ethiopia shut down after regional violence,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Authorities have shut off Internet access in eastern Ethiopia amid an outbreak of violence there, residents said on Wednesday, a sign of the challenges facing reformist Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in containing ethnic tensions in parts of the country.
The residents, one speaking from Oromia region and the other from the city of Harar, said the connection had been down for three days -- the first time access has been cut off since parliament lifted a state of emergency in June.
Ethiopian government spokesman Ahmed Shide did not immediately respond to a phone call and a text message seeking comment on the shutdown, which was reported on Tuesday by digital rights group Access Now.
Violence broke out on Saturday in Jijiga, the capital of Ethiopia's Somali region, with mobs looting properties owned by ethnic minorities. Security officials shot dead four people, a witness told Reuters.
The government said unrest had been stoked by regional officials.
The residents in Oromia and Harar said they were concerned the violence could spread from the Somali region into other parts of eastern Ethiopia, in part because tit-for-tat ethnic reprisals were one part of the unrest that roiled the country for three years until the resignation of Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn in February.
The government had imposed emergency rule in February, a day after Hailemariam's resignation after three years of street protests and violent unrest.
Since replacing Desalegn in April, Abiy has turned politics and the economy on its head in the country of 100 million people but continuing ethnic violence poses a challenge to his reform drive. 
Nearly 1 million Ethiopians are currently displaced from their homes due to ethnic violence in the Somali and Oromia regions and elsewhere, according to the United Nations.
The government's move to shut down the Internet amid the latest violence over the weekend suggests a continuation of a knee-jerk reaction to unrest in recent years.
Abiy, a 41-year-old former army officer, has pledged greater freedoms. In the four months since he took office, the government has released political prisoners and lifted a ban on opposition groups.
During the protests before Abiy took office, the government frequently switched off the Internet, sometimes for several months at a time, in Oromia, a large region that surrounds the capital Addis Ababa and extends east all the way to the Somali region. 
Halting the ability of young people to organize demonstrations or strikes online or on social media, using smartphones, was a strategy used to contain protests. 

Ethiopia, a country of 100 million people, is one of the few countries in the world that still has a state telecoms monopoly, which makes shutting off the internet more simple than if there were multiple telecoms providers.

1629,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 05:40AM ET</span>","Health agencies warn Idlib offensive could uproot 700,000 Syrians","GENEVA (Reuters) - An anticipated Syrian government offensive against rebels in Idlib province could displace more than 700,000 people, far more than were uprooted in a recent battle in the southwest of Syria, a U.N.-led group of health agencies said in a monthly report.
Many of Syria's battles have ended with agreements for fighters and their families to depart for Idlib governorate, where an influx of displaced people has roughly doubled the population to around 2.5 million. 
The United Nations has said the province has become a ""dumping ground"" for evacuees.
The monthly Health Cluster Bulletin, published by a group of health-focused aid agencies led by the World Health Organization, said aid workers were bracing for the Idlib battle.
""Increased hostilities are expected in the North West in the coming period, to result in displacements of 250,000 to over 700,000 people in Idlib and surrounding areas,"" the report said. 
""This will cause an increased need for humanitarian assistance to the new vulnerable and host communities, especially emergency health services."" 
Between mid-June and the end of July, 184,000 people were displaced by a battle in the south and subsequent agreements to end the fighting there. Among the displaced, more than 10,000 went to Idlib and northern Aleppo governorate, the report said.
The U.N. has repeatedly warned about the dangers of an attack on Idlib. Syria's President Bashar al-Assad said in a Russian media interview last month that Idlib governorate would be a priority for his forces.
U.N. regional humanitarian coordinator Panos Moumtzis said in June that the governorate's entire population of 2.5 million could be displaced and move towards the Turkish border if there was a major battle.
Such a battle would be much more complicated and brutal than anything seen so far in the seven-year war, he said. 
The health cluster report included a map showing the breakdown of the population in southern and eastern parts of the governorate, suggesting that the displacement scenario was based on an attack by government forces from the south and east. 

The map showed population estimates in four zones from the frontline up to the Latakia-Aleppo highway and the Hama-Aleppo highway, with a total of 993,000 people in those zones.

A day earlier the authorities said they were looking for Biti in connection with violence following last week's disputed election in which President Emmerson Mnangagwa was declared winner. 
Six people were killed in the post-election army clampdown on protests against the result and Mnangagwa's main rival, opposition leader Nelson Chamisa, has accused the government of a security crackdown on his party's members.
Biti, whose People's Democratic Party had formed an election alliance with Chamisa's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), had been in hiding since last week and had feared for his life, his lawyer Nqobizitha Mlilo said.
""We have kickstarted processes of seeking political asylum so we are waiting to see how far the processes will go. His life has been in danger,"" he said.
Police have not yet informed him of the charges, Mlilo said.
The post-election turmoil was reminiscent of the long rule of Robert Mugabe, who was toppled last November in a de facto military coup and replaced by Mnangagwa.
Police spokeswoman Charity Charamba said she had no information on Biti's arrest. The Criminal Investigations Department had said on Tuesday police were looking for Biti, MDC chairman Morgen Komichi and MDC youth leader Happymore Chidziva linked to last week's violence. 
Mlilo said Biti was arrested after presenting himself to Zambian immigration officials at Chirundu border post, 350 km north (217 miles) of the capital Harare, where Zimbabwean and Zambian officials share the same building.

""It seems the Zambian immigration officials alerted the Zimbabwean police and they effected an arrest,"" said Mlilo who was at the border with Biti.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - A Sri Lankan court on Wednesday handed a six-year jail term to a Buddhist monk accused of inciting violence against Muslims, holding him guilty of contempt just months after he was convicted of intimidating the wife of a missing journalist.
The monk, Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara, leads the hardline Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) or ""Buddhist Power Force"", which government ministers and Muslims have accused of stirring up violence against Muslims and Christians, allegations he has denied.
The court sentenced him to six years' rigorous imprisonment over a 2016 incident when Gnanasara interrupted a court hearing on the abduction of the journalist, Prageeth Eknaligoda, in which military intelligence officials were accused.
He shouted at the judge and lawyers because the military officials had not been given bail, and threatened Eknaligoda’s wife.
""The convict intentionally committed the offence to undermine the judiciary,"" Preethi Padman Surasena, the president of the court of appeal, said in delivering Wednesday's judgment, adding, ""Found guilty of all charges beyond reasonable doubt."" 
The monk was convicted on four counts of contempt of court, receiving terms of four years each on the first and the second counts, six years on the third and five for the fourth, all to run concurrently.
A BBS official told Reuters the group would appeal against Wednesday's ruling.
""We feel there is an attempt by interested parties to have judicial process targeting Gnanasara, therefore, though we do not agree with the judgment, we accept the sentence, and we will appeal,"" said Dilantha Vithanage, the group's chief executive.
Gnanasara, who is being treated in hospital for an ailment, was not in court for the ruling. He has been on bail since filing an appeal against a conviction in a separate case on June 14.
In that case, he received two concurrent jail terms of six months, a fine of 1,500 rupees ($9.39), and a compensation payment of 50,000 rupees ($313) for having threatened the journalist's wife, Sandhya Eknaligoda.
Since 2014, the monk has faced accusations in cases regarding anti-Muslim violence, hate speech, and defaming the Koran, the Muslim holy book. 
That year Gnanasara signed a pact with Myanmar's Ashin Wirathu, who once described himself as ""the Burmese bin Laden"", in what the duo called a bid to counter regional conversion efforts by Islamists.

Parliament's opening session will be presided over by King Norodom Sihamoni, Hun Sen said.
""The King will invite all members elect of the National Assembly for the first session,"" Hun Sen told thousands of factory workers in Kampong Speu province, 50 km (30 miles) southwest of the capital Phnom Penh on Wednesday.
Although official results won't be announced until mid-August, Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party (CPP) said it had won all 125 parliamentary seats following the July 29 vote. 
Critics say a campaign of intimidation by Hun Sen and his allies preceded the vote.
The election, the country's sixth since democracy was restored in 1993, followed the dissolution of the main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) and a crackdown on activists, independent media and opposition politicians.
CNRP leader Kem Sokha was jailed on treason charges in September. He remains in pre-trial detention.
The government will hold its first cabinet meeting on Sept 7, Hun Sen said on Wednesday. 
On Monday, Hun Sen said that he wanted to give a speech to the United Nations' General Assembly in September to show the world that Cambodia does not need outside approval.

Typhoon ""Shanshan"", a Chinese girl's name, is currently a Category 2 typhoon but is expected to weaken slightly as it moves closer to the eastern part of Japan's main island of Honshu, drawing near to Tokyo in the early hours of Thursday and possibly snarling the morning rush hour.
The Japanese Meteorological Agency warned that Tokyo and surrounding areas could get as much as 350 mm (14 inches) of rain in the 24 hours to noon on Thursday, with winds gusting as high as 180 kmh (111 mph).
Shanshan is expected to move extremely slowly, perhaps as slow as 15 kmh (9 mph), meaning intense rain may fall in one area for an extended period.
After pounding the area near Tokyo the storm is expected to rake the northeastern part of Honshu before weakening to tropical storm strength and heading out into the Pacific.
Western Japan, the site of deadly floods in July, will be spared.
Japan has been hit by one weather disaster after another since the start of July, including a record-breaking heatwave that saw temperatures surge to 41.1 Celsius (106 Fahrenheit) and killed at least 132 people as of August 5.

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Nine Guatemalan children separated from their parents at the U.S. border under President Donald Trump's ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy were flown home on Tuesday and reunited with their deported families, Guatemala's government said.
Nazario Jacinto Carrillo, a farmer from the village of Huehuetenango, embraced his 5-1/2-year-old daughter after what he said was their three-month separation since he was deported back to Guatemala and she remained in the United States.
""I thought 'this is wrong because they've taken away my daughter',"" said Carrillo. His daughter was in San Diego, he said.
""I feel at peace, happy, content,"" he said as he held his daughter in his arms and covered her with a blanket so she could not be photographed
The nine children, aged 6 to 14, were flown to Guatemala City from New York. They were the first Guatemalan children to be returned to their home country after being separated under the policy, said Guatemala's social welfare ministry.
The U.S. government proposed on Aug. 2 that non-profit groups should take the lead in locating as many as 500 parents deported or removed from the United States without their children.
""I really missed my mom. When they separated us I felt really sad,"" said 6-year-old Leo Jeancarlo de Leon after being reunited with his mother. ""Now I want to go play with my toys.""
The boy's mother, Lourdes de Leon, said the harrowing experience was a ""torment"" for the both of them.
""I want to go home. I'm happy,"" said the visibly relieved mother. ""We just want to be together a while.""
Some 2,500 children were separated from their families as part of Trump's strict policy toward illegal immigration that began in early May. Many of the families, which fled to the United States to escape widespread violence at home, had crossed the border illegally, while others had sought asylum.
The Trump Administration ended the family separations in June after weeks of international outcry over the policy.

About 1,900 children had been reconnected with their parents or a sponsor by Aug. 3.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's President-elect Ivan Duque was sworn in to office on Tuesday, pledging to unite a divided nation behind his plan to toughen a peace accord with Marxist rebels and rekindle economic growth.
Right-wing Duque, who replaces Nobel Prize winner Juan Manuel Santos, faces significant challenges. 
The economy remains weak, a new wave of drug trafficking gangs have moved into areas once controlled by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrillas, and nearly a million Venezuelan migrants have crossed into Colombia looking for food and work.
The 42-year-old lawyer and former senator for the Democratic Center party won a decisive victory against a leftist opponent in June's election, promising to make adjustments to the domestically-controversial peace accord with the FARC, cut corporate taxes and redouble security efforts in certain areas.
""I want to govern Colombia with unbreakable values and principles, overcoming left and right divisions,"" Duque said in an address before dignitaries, after receiving the presidential sash in Bogota's Plaza Bolivar. 
""I want to govern Colombia with the spirit of building, never of destroying."" 
Ongoing peace negotiations with National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels, the country's last remaining insurgent group, will be evaluated over the next 30 days, Duque said, adding that any process must be ""credible"" and based on an end to guerrilla criminal activity over a specified timeframe.
He said he will also send an anti-corruption bill to Congress and launch measures to reactivate the sluggish economy. 
Duque is a protege of hardline ex-President Alvaro Uribe, a harsh critic of the peace agreement, whose father was killed by rebels. 
Uribe, facing allegations of witness tampering and bribery that he has denied, is seen by many as the power behind the relatively inexperienced Duque. 
But Duque, a father of three who worked at the Inter-American Development Bank before Uribe asked him to take a Senate seat in 2014, has already shown independence in some cabinet picks and in a softening of his anti-accord rhetoric. 
The 2016 peace deal brought an end to the FARC's part in more than five decades of war which killed some 260,000, and saw thousands of rebels demobilize in return for amnesty.
And though its leadership will be tried for war crimes, Duque is angry they will not serve jail time before taking up 10 guaranteed congressional seats.
Colombia's youngest president of the modern era has not specified the changes he would make to the agreement, but anything more than cosmetic will be tough to get through a Congress which has broadly backed the deal.
Even so, alterations may help satisfy some detractors in a nation polarized by the deal. 
Duque can count on continued support from the United States, said Nikki Haley, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, in Bogota.
""He very much sees the fact that the peace process, while it happened and was historic, wasn't perfect and so now it needs to be tweaked a bit,"" she told journalists.
The prematurely gray-haired Duque has also said he plans to cut taxes and raise revenue from an evasion crackdown. He wants to relax the so-called fiscal rule, which obliges the government to reduce the budget deficit.
""In economic matters, mistakes have been made that we must never again repeat,"" said Duque. ""A tax policy motivated by the expansion of spending has led us to having asphyxiating burdens that affect savings, investment, job formalization and productivity."" 

With Colombia's debt rated BBB- by S&P and BBB by Fitch, Duque will have a hard time satisfying credit rating agencies unless he is able to replace revenue lost from weaker international oil prices.

""I respect the people who say don't forgive or forget. I say, forgive, but don't forget,"" said the leader, who believes that Mexico's army-led approach to fighting cartels has led to more violence, but has not been clear about how radically he will change strategies.
Lopez Obrador, who takes office on Dec. 1, has said he will only push forward the still-vague plan, which could include truth commissions, special courts, victim reparations and reduced sentences for low-level offenders, with public input and support. 
He will hold public forums in several of Mexico's most violent cities, although he has not said how he will measure the public response.
Many audience members cheered his remarks on Tuesday, but others interrupted to call out, ""Punishment for the guilty."" 
Some directed outrage at the governor of Ciudad Juarez's Chihuahua state, Javier Corral, blaming him for a spike in violence.
Olga Sanchez, Lopez Obrador's pick for interior minister, soothed the crowd, promising economic support for victims and recognizing the depth of the crisis in the country.
""This is a country of missing people. We know it is full of hidden graves, mass graves and morgues full of unidentified bodies,"" she said. 
Last year marked Mexico's deadliest on record with 31,174 homicides, and 2018 is on track to be worse. 
On Friday, eight men and three women were found killed in a home in Ciudad Juarez. 
The city's crime rate improved in recent years, but has deteriorated again since 2016. 
Outside the auditorium on Tuesday, people held banners bearing the names and photos of people who have disappeared from Ciudad Juarez since the 1990s, when women in particular became targets of killings and kidnappings. 

One man waved a placard printed with a man's photo and name above the words, ""unpunished killer,"" while a woman waved a sign that declared, ""The blood of our dead cannot be negotiated.""

1641,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 10:10PM ET</span>","California battles its biggest ever wildfire, Trump vows support","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump struck a more conciliatory tone over California's raging wildfires on Tuesday, saying he was in constant contact with officials there, a day after blaming the state's environmental policies for exacerbating the fires.
One of the 17 major fires in California, dubbed the Mendocino Complex, became the biggest in state history on Tuesday, eclipsing a previous record set only eight months ago, as hot, windy conditions fanned the blazes in what Governor Jerry Brown has called a ""new normal."" 
The Mendocino Complex, made up of two fires, grew to nearly 300,000 acres (117,700 hectares) - almost the size of Los Angeles - and was expected to burn for the rest of the month, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said. 
The blaze has surpassed the Thomas Fire, which burned 281,893 acres (114,078 hectares) in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties in southern California last December, destroying over 1,000 structures. 
In the last two days, Trump has said California was letting water run into the ocean instead of using it to fight blazes and blamed California's environmental policies for worsening the fires.
The comments baffled California firefighters, who said they had more than enough water to douse the flames. 
""We're going to have to have some meetings about it because there are ... things you can do to mitigate what's happening,"" Trump said at a dinner in New Jersey.
The fires have killed seven people, destroyed over 1,500 structures and displaced tens of thousands of people over the past month.
CLIMATE CHANGE BLAMED 
Climate change is widely blamed for higher temperatures that have fueled wildfires in California, and as far afield as Portugal, Sweden and Siberia. 
Temperatures in Northern California could reach 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43 Celsius) over the next few days, the National Weather Service said, making it easier for fire to spread.
The Mendocino Complex has burnt 75 homes and forced the evacuation of 23,322 people. Firefighters are trying to keep fire out of communities like Nice, Lucerne and Clearlake Oaks.
""It's going into residences, backyards, farmland,"" said Mitch Bosma, a spokesman with Cal Fire. 
The fires are on track to be the most destructive in a decade, prompting Brown and Republican leaders such as state Senator Ted Gaines to call for thinning and controlled burns of forests to reduce fire danger - moves opposed by environmentalists who say they kill wildlife. 

""We have to re-examine the way we manage our forests, the way we build our houses - how we build them, where we build them - and how much we invest in our fire protection services,"" Brown said at a weekend news conference after touring an area destroyed by the deadly Carr Fire in Shasta County.

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - Former El Salvadoran President Antonio Saca pleaded guilty in court to embezzlement and money laundering involving more than $300 million during his government, his lawyer said on Tuesday, as Saca sought to reduce his prison sentence.
Saca pleaded guilty in July in a document sent to the attorney general in exchange for reducing his sentence from 30 to 10 years in prison, said his lawyer Lisandro Quintanilla, who attended the trial at a San Salvador court.
Prosecutors said they accepted the confession and asked the judge to provide a quick ruling. 
""This is an abbreviated procedure, it does not mean that the case has been lost, in fact, we are proposing a prison sentence of 10 years for the former president of the Republic,"" said Jorge Cortez, head of the attorney general's financial investigation unit.
Saca, who was president from 2004 to 2009, and six other former high-level public officials are on trial for the charges.
They are all accused of diverting funds from the treasury to personal bank accounts to benefit individuals, companies connected to the former president and advertising for his Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) party.

Saca, 53, was detained in October 2016 at the wedding of one of his sons.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Tuesday threw his support behind the idea of creating a space-focused military command but stopped short of promising the new ""Space Force"" branch of service that President Donald Trump has touted.
Trump called for the creation of a sixth branch of the military, for space, a move critics said could harm the Air Force and which U.S. officials say would require an act of Congress.
The U.S. military, however, could create a unified combatant command for space, like one it created to focus on cyber warfare.
A Pentagon report to Congress expected in the coming days could examine the possibility of doing something similar with the U.S. military's space capabilities, which include everything from satellites enabling the Global Positioning System (GPS) to sensors that help track missile launches.
Asked whether he supported establishing a new combatant command for space, Mattis responded: ""Yes, absolutely.""""We need to address space as a developing war-fighting domain and a combatant command is certainly one thing that we can establish,"" he told reporters at the Pentagon, adding: ""This is a process we're in.""
Mattis once voiced opposition to creating a new branch of the U.S. military to focus on space-based military assets, saying in a 2017 letter to a lawmaker that would likely ""present a narrower and even parochial approach to space operations.""
Mattis has since suggested he was not ruling out the idea and on Tuesday left the possibility open. Mattis said he was coordinating closely with Vice President Mike Pence and was in complete agreement with the White House.
Asked whether a new branch of the military would be created, Mattis responded: ""I don't have all the final answers yet. We're still putting that together.""
The United States is a member of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which bars stationing weapons of mass destruction in space and only allows use of the moon and other celestial bodies for peaceful purposes.
The idea of a Space Force has been raised before, including in previous administrations, with proponents saying it would make the Pentagon's efforts more focused and efficient.
It has also faced criticism from senior military officials. Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein told a 2017 congressional hearing that creating a new space branch would ""move us in the wrong direction."" The Air Force oversees most of the country's space-related military activity.

Goldfein has since praised Trump's focus on space.

1644,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 06:18PM ET</span>",Brazil judge lifts border closure for Venezuelan immigrants,"By Ricardo Brito and Anthony Boadle
BRASILIA (Reuters) - A Brazilian federal appeals court judge on Tuesday overturned a ruling barring Venezuelan immigrants fleeing economic and political turmoil from entering Brazil.
On Sunday, a federal judge in the northern state of Roraima ordered the border closed until the state could create ""humanitarian"" conditions to receive a massive of Venezuelans.
Appeals court judge Kassio Marques acknowledged ""grave violations of the public and judicial order,"" but overturned the lower court's ruling, saying the closure would not improve humanitarian conditions for Venezuelans fleeing their country.
A Foreign Ministry official said the Brazilian government does not contemplate at all closing the border because that would violate its international commitments on human rights and a new immigration law that keeps the door open to all refugees.
The Roraima state government, which has been trying to shut the border to stop the influx of Venezuelans, said it would appeal the latest court decision and seek 184 million reais in federal compensation to cover its additional costs in health, education and public security.
Over the last three years, tens of thousands of Venezuelans have overwhelmed Roraima, causing a humanitarian crisis with families sleeping in the streets amid rising crime and prostitution.
The federal police said that it never actually closed the frontier and had only begun preparations for shutting it on Monday, but the normal flow of Venezuelan immigrants was re-established on Tuesday morning.
A state government official in Roraima said that although the federal police never closed the border, officers did momentarily stop Venezuelans from entering. 
""They only let pass those who had been granted asylum, residency or could prove they had passage out of the country,"" the official told Reuters. ""There was even a little protest.""
The U.N. Refugee Agency (UNHCR) welcomed the Brazilian judiciary's decision. 
Nearly 33,000 Venezuelans had asked for asylum in Brazil as of April 30, while another 25,000 had entered the country by other means, including humanitarian visas, labor and migration visas, UNHCR spokesman William Spindler said in Geneva.
""In 2018, the number of asylum seekers from Venezuela is already larger than for the whole of 2017,"" he told reporters.
Venezuela is in the grip of a severe economic crisis, with shortages of food, medicines and other essentials, and periodic waves of protests against leftist President Nicolas Maduro.

The Brazilian Air Force began flying Venezuelan immigrants in Roraima to other cities of Brazil in May and has so far flown more than 800 Venezuelans out of Boa Vista, the state capital.

1645,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 05:10PM ET</span>",Former city police chief claims role in Venezuela drone attack,"By Carlos Vargas and Brian Ellsworth
BOGOTA/CARACAS (Reuters) - A former Venezuelan municipal police chief and anti-government activist says he helped organize an operation to launch armed drones over a military rally on Saturday that President Nicolas Maduro has called an assassination attempt.
In an interview, Salvatore Lucchese, a Venezuelan activist who was previously imprisoned for his role in past protests, told Reuters he orchestrated the attack with a loose association of anti-Maduro militants known generally in Venezuela as the ""resistance.""
The ""resistance"" referred to by Lucchese is a diffuse collection of street activists, student organizers and former military officers. It has little formal structure, but is known in the country mostly for organizing protests in recent years in which demonstrators have clashed with police and soldiers.
Reuters could not independently verify Lucchese's claims about the attack, in which drones flew over the rally in central Caracas. Explosives aboard the drones detonated, injuring seven military officers and sending attendees scurrying for cover.
Lucchese described the incident as part of a sustained, armed effort against Maduro. He declined to describe his precise role in the operation, in the broader resistance or identify others involved, citing the need to protect their identity.
""We had an objective and in the moment we were not able to materialize it 100 percent,"" Lucchese said in an interview in Bogota, where he is traveling because of activities with other opposition figures. ""The armed struggle will continue.""
Venezuela's Information Ministry did not reply to a request for comment.
Earlier this year, Lucchese parted ways with Popular Will, a prominent opposition party, saying he disagreed with its continued dialogue with Maduro's administration. The government is widely criticized for authoritarian tactics, human rights abuses and economic policies that have led to recession and malnutrition across the formerly prosperous Andean nation.
Juan Guaido, one of Popular Will's national leaders, said Lucchese was expelled for ""differences with the party and the national leadership"" but did not elaborate further.
Guaido also told Reuters Popular Will rejects the use of violence, a position echoed by other mainstream opposition parties in the wake of the attack.
Maduro, who was chosen by late leftist President Hugo Chavez as the Socialist Party candidate to succeed him in 2013, often says Venezuela's problems are the result of an ""economic war"" by enemies abroad, including the United States. He blamed the drone attack on right-wing opposition figures and foreign enablers, specifically citing the government of neighboring Colombia.
Colombia's government has denied any involvement.
Venezuelan authorities over the weekend arrested six people, including one suspect who had been detained for protests in 2014 and another wanted for involvement in a 2017 military base attack. The government said the drones carried plastic explosives detonated remotely.
Saturday's blasts, which shook television footage from the rally and rattled nearby buildings, differed from previous suggestions by Maduro's government of pending attacks against it. Maduro and top aides have spoken of foiled assassination and coup plots in the past, but provided little evidence for them. 
Now, it remains unclear exactly how organized or equipped armed opponents may be.
A little-known group called the National Movement of Soldiers in T-Shirts over the weekend also claimed responsibility for the drone attack. It, too, describes itself as part of the ""resistance.""
Lucchese declined to say whether he is associated with Soldiers in T-Shirts. A member of the group, who declined to be identified by name, in an exchange with Reuters via a messaging platform declined to comment on Lucchese.
The 52-year-old activist first drew attention after being jailed for ten months starting in 2014 for refusing to break up anti-Maduro protests. As police chief of the municipality of San Diego, in central Carabobo state, he disobeyed Interior Ministry orders to clear demonstrators, Lucchese said.
His account of the arrest and jail sentence is supported by a ruling on his conviction published by Venezuela's Supreme Court at the time. 
The government released Lucchese at the end of his sentence in February 2015, according to Lucchese and local media reports. Reuters could not find government documentation of his release.
Lucchese told Reuters he left Venezuela for an undisclosed location last August, after learning the government sought his arrest once more, this time for treason and inciting military rebellion. The warrant was widely reported by Venezuelan media in recent months, but Reuters was unable to review a copy of it.

Lucchese said he now resides abroad and continues to work with other anti-Maduro activists, stressing that armed resistance is the only way to topple Maduro. ""No dictator leaves power peacefully,"" he told Reuters.

1646,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 03:40PM ET</span>","Ex-Argentina VP Boudou found guilty, sentenced in corruption case","BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Amado Boudou, who had been former Argentine President Cristina Fernandez's economy minister and vice president, was found guilty and sentenced on Tuesday to five years and 10 months of prison on corruption charges.
The Fourth Federal Tribunal, in Buenos Aires, ruled that a deal Boudou had made with a bankrupt money printing company was ""incompatible with public office."" Boudou had pleaded not guilty to charges that he helped the company exit bankruptcy in exchange for an equity stake in 2010, when he was economy minister.
Boudou became the highest-profile official in the Fernandez administration to be handed a prison sentence, but several former officials are facing a range of corruption charges.
Progress in the judicial cases against the former officials since President Mauricio Macri took office in December 2015 has been heralded as a milestone for a country long known for impunity, but Fernandez and her allies have said the cases amount to political persecution.
Fernandez has been indicted on corruption charges but enjoys immunity from arrest as a senator. She has admitted possible corruption in her government but denies wrongdoing.
Before Boudou's sentence was read, he said in court proceedings broadcast on local television that the case was a ""matter of revenge"" by members of Fernandez's left-leaning administration.
""Politicians that stay in the lane that the powerful decide walk without problems. Politicians that decide to change reality are persecuted,"" Boudou said. ""This is a matter of revenge.""
The ruling came days after local newspaper La Nacion published the contents of notebooks kept by a driver in Fernandez's administration, in which he detailed transporting millions of dollars in bribe cash from construction executives to government officials.
Dozens of executives and officials have been arrested in the past week as part of that case.

1648,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 02:43PM ET</span>",Congo ruling coalition's presidential candidate to be announced 'in the coming hours',"KINSHASA (Reuters) - The candidate to represent Democratic Republic of Congo President Joseph Kabila's ruling coalition in a presidential election in December will be announced ""in the coming hours"", the government spokesman said on Tuesday. 
Spokesman Lambert Mende's statement followed a meeting between Kabila and coalition members at his farm outside the capital Kinshasa. Candidates have until Wednesday afternoon to register with the national electoral commission. 
Kabila, in power since 2001, is barred by term limits from running for re-election but has refused to commit publicly to not standing. That has raised fears he might do so anyway, which risks throwing the volatile central African country into chaos. 
Security forces have killed dozens of protesters since Kabila refused to quit power at the end of mandate in December 2016, saying the government was not yet prepared to hold the election to succeed him. Militia violence in the eastern borderlands with Rwanda and Uganda has also risen.
Western powers and Congo's neighbors fear even worse violence across the country if Kabila digs in and runs, with memories still fresh of civil wars around the turn of the century that killed millions, most from hunger and disease. 
Kabila met on Tuesday afternoon with members of his electoral coalition, the Common Front for Congo (FCC), at his farm in the village of Kingakati, about 80 km (50 miles) outside the Kinshasa.
Participants in the meeting included Mende, Commerce Minister Jean-Lucien Bussa, Planning Minister Modeste Bahati and the president of the lower house of parliament, Aubin Minaku. 
Minaku has been tipped as one of the candidates to emerge as Kabila's chosen successor, as has former prime minister Augustin Matata Ponyo. 
Several opposition candidates have also registered their candidacies for the Dec. 23 vote. They include former vice president Jean-Pierre Bemba, who was recently acquitted of war crimes at the International Criminal Court, and Vital Kamerhe, who finished third in the 2011 election. 
On Tuesday, Felix Tshisekedi, the president of Congo's largest opposition party, the UDPS, and son of the late opposition icon Etienne Tshisekedi, filed his candidacy at the electoral commission headquarters in Kinshasa.
As Tshisekdi drove to the headquarters, clashes briefly broke out between supporters of his, who threw rocks, and police officers, who riposted with volleys of teargas, witnesses said.

Tryphon Kin-Kiey, a Kabila ally who founded a political party called ""Kabila Desire"", also submitted his candidacy on Tuesday as an independent, a move that was quickly disavowed by members of his political coalition.

1649,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 02:21PM ET</span>",U.S. agent can be sued over Mexican boy's shooting death across border,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - A U.S. border patrol agent acquitted of murder for shooting a Mexican teenager to death across the Arizona-Mexico border is not immune from civil damages claims by the boy's mother, a federal appeals court ruled on Tuesday.
The dissenting judge from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' 2-1 decision accused the majority of ignoring legal precedent and said the Supreme Court may need to weigh in.
Tuesday's decision allows Araceli Rodriguez to sue the agent Lonnie Swartz over the Oct. 10, 2012 shooting of 16-year-old Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez.
The boy had been walking down a street in Nogales, Mexico when Swartz, then on duty and standing on an embankment on U.S. soil, fired through a border fence, striking him about 10 times.
Swartz said he acted in self-defense in response to a group of rock throwers, while Rodriguez said her son was walking peacefully.
A Tucson, Arizona federal jury in April acquitted Swartz of second-degree murder, and deadlocked on lesser manslaughter charges. A retrial on those charges was scheduled for Oct. 23.
In the civil case, a lower court judge rejected Swartz's claim of qualified immunity, and said Rodriguez could seek damages for violations of her son's constitutional rights.
During his appeal, Swartz adopted an argument offered by the U.S. Department of Justice that Rodriguez lacked a so-called ""Bivens"" claim against him for violating the Fourth Amendment.
But in Tuesday's majority opinion, Circuit Judge Andrew Kleinfeld found it ""inconceivable that any reasonable officer"" to think he or she could kill Elena Rodriguez, as the mother suggested, ""for no reason.""
Kleinfeld distinguished a 1990 Supreme Court precedent limiting the Fourth Amendment's extraterritorial reach, saying Swartz ""acted on American soil subject to American law"" and it was ""clearly established"" he could not shoot across the border. He also said Swartz's conduct might ""shock[] the conscience.""
Swartz's lawyer Sean Chapman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.
“The court made clear that the Constitution does not stop at the border,"" said Lee Gelernt, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer representing Rodriguez. ""The ruling could not have come at a more important time, when [the Trump] administration is seeking to further militarize the border.""
Circuit Judge Milan Smith dissented, saying it was for Congress to extend Bivens, and that another federal appeals court reached the opposite result in a similar case.
He said the majority ""tees up our court for a new 'chastening'"" by the Supreme Court, known for often reversing 9th Circuit decisions.
The case is Rodriguez v Swartz, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-16410.

The two fellow members of the NATO military alliance have differed over Turkey's crackdown on suspected opponents of Erdogan after a failed coup in 2016 and over its detention of German citizens.
The spokeswoman did not say if Erdogan would also hold talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel. Merkel's office declined to comment.
Germany's mass-selling Bild newspaper reported last month that Erdogan would visit Germany around late September.
A state visit would include a reception by Steinmeier with military honors and a formal state banquet. The German and Turkish foreign ministers vowed earlier this year to do everything to improve relations.
Their resolve led to the release in February of a German-Turkish journalist who had been held in Turkey for a year for alleged security offences. His release fulfilled a key demand by Germany, which still takes issue with what it calls Turkey's deteriorating record on human rights.
Another German national was arrested in southeastern Turkey last month accused of spreading propaganda for Turkish militants, Turkish state media said.
The Turkish government has purged more than 150,000 civil servants and charged 77,000 people since the failed coup. 
It has also launched cross-border operations into Syria against what it says are terrorist threats by the Kurdish YPG militia, which it deems a terrorist organization linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).
Rights groups and Turkey's Western allies have criticized the crackdown, saying Erdogan has used the coup as a pretext to muzzle dissent. The government says the measures are necessary.

1651,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 11:23AM ET</span>",Beekeeping in Yemen becomes a dangerous profession in war,"SANAA (Reuters) - Yemen's beekeepers risk air strikes and land mines as they traverse the country's valleys, transporting their hives on pick-up trucks to produce some of the world's finest honey.
The impoverished Arab state, known for its Sidr honey made from the jujube tree, has endured three years of war that have pushed it to the verge of famine and shattered the economy.
""Before the war...we produced large quantities of honey. [But now] honey farmers who move their private farms at night sometimes get hit by mistake,"" said Faris al-Howry, who owns one of the main honey stores in the capital Sanaa. 
""It's happened with two or three farmers we know where their farms were bombed [in air strikes].""
A Saudi-led coalition which intervened in 2015 to restore the internationally recognized government has conducted thousands of air strikes in its battle against the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement which controls the most populous areas of Yemen, including Sanaa.
Some air strikes have hit civilian targets, although the coalition denies doing so intentionally. Houthi fighters have also placed landmines in territory under their control.
Yemen exported 50,000 tonnes of honey per year before the war but exports have since fallen by more than 50 percent, according to the Federation of Yemeni Beekepers, which says there are around 100,000 people working in honey farms in Yemen. 
""Breeders must now be mindful that when they're trying to move from location to location, they could be targeted or bombed by mistake,"" said Abdullah Abdullah Yareem, head of the Yemeni Organization for Honey and Agriculture Development.
He was speaking at a honey farm in al-Mahwit governorate where men tended to wooden hive boxes as bees flitted between sunflowers in a field.
He added it has also become costlier to export honey due to stringent measures imposed on maritime flows by the Saudi-backed coalition, which accuses the Houthis of smuggling Iranian-made weapons, a charge denied by the group and Tehran.
There is only one outlet - to Saudi Arabia, so all exports must flow through there, said Abdullah. 
""This has created a problem that raised transportation costs making the product reach the consumer at a very high price.""
Howry said business is bad as few people could afford luxuries. The price of honey in Yemen ranges from $100 for 1 kilo of Sidr to $68 for less premium types. Outside of Yemen the honey sell for around $180 dollars per kilo.

""Sales are down 75 percent...There is no income, no salaries and no spending,"" he said in the store, where boxes of honeycomb are on display on the counter.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - The U.S. ambassador joined a ceremony in Nairobi on Tuesday to commemorate 20 years since truck bombs hit the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing 258 people and marking the start of al Qaeda's global campaign of violence.
Some 200 Kenyans and Americans, many of them survivors of the attack, gathered at Nairobi's August 7th Memorial Park to pray and remember the victims.
""We forgive those who hurt us, but we may not forget. Let's pray for them to change their mind so that we can live happily together,"" said Thaddeus Mutiiria Nyaga, whose son, Emmanuel, was killed on Aug. 7. His name was read out along with those of the other victims, as candles were lit during the ceremony. 
The blasts killed 12 Americans, and wounded several thousand people in what was al Qaeda's first big attack in a campaign by the Islamist militants. 
Three years later, the group would conduct its most notorious attack, flying passenger planes into New York's World Trade Center and the Pentagon, killing some 3,000 people.
""The terrorists really sought to divide us. They sought to divide Kenyans and Americans. They sought to attack civilization. And they failed,"" U.S. Ambassador Robert Godec said at the ceremony.
Kenya's director of counter-terrorism, Martin Kimani, said terrorism remained a threat, ""but our country has taken giant strides to prepare better to be more ready, and part of that readiness is our cooperation with our friends"".
In 2013, gunmen from the Somali militant group al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda affiliate, killed at least 67 people inside a shopping mall and held out for four days as security forces laid siege to the complex.
Kenyan troops are fighting in neighboring Somalia against al-Shabaab as part of an African Union peacekeeping force that has been deployed there for more than a decade.
Mourner Ali Mwadama said militants who say they kill in the name of religion do not represent Islam or any faith. 

""We can't call them Muslims,"" he said. ""If you are a Muslim you must follow the rules of Allah.""

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia's government has signed an agreement to end hostilities with the Oromo Liberation Front, which it had previously declared a terrorist movement, state television reported on Tuesday.
The deal appeared another step in a drive by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to improve security and diplomatic relations, reform institutions and open parts of the state-controlled economy.
Since the 1970s, the rebels have fought a low-level insurgency for self-determination for the Oromiya region, which is Ethiopia's largest and home to the Oromo ethnic group.
The OLF was initially part of a transitional government set up in 1991 by rebels from the EPRDF coalition who had driven Mengistu Haile Mariam from power, but they soon fell out with the coalition.
On Tuesday, the government signed a reconciliation agreement to end hostilities with the OLF's exiled leader Dawud Ibsa, who lives in exile in Asmara, the capital of neighbouring Eritrea, said Eritrea's Information Minister Yemane Gebremeskel.
""The agreement further states that ... the OLF will conduct its political activities in Ethiopia through peaceful means,"" he said on Twitter. The deal was signed in Asmara.
The group declared a unilateral ceasefire last month after parliament removed it from a list of banned terrorist groups that it had been part of since 2008.
Abiy took office in April and his reforms have included extending an olive branch to dissidents overseas.

He has also acknowledged abuses by security services and ended a military stalemate with Eritrea that followed a 1998-2000 border war in which 80,000 people are thought to have died.

The two men killed in northern Beit Lahiya were Hamas snipers taking part in a live-fire exercise within a compound on Gazan territory, the group's armed wing said in a statement. It deemed Israel's shelling of them a ""criminal act"".
In an earlier statement, the Israeli military said gunmen had fired on its soldiers from a Hamas post, which was shelled by a tank in response. There was no word of Israeli casualties. 
The military released footage that it said was of the incident. One of the grainy black and white video clips shows two men in a watchtower, one appears to open fire as puffs of smoke burst in front of him. The video then cuts to separate footage of a shell hitting the post and an explosion. 
Reuters was immediately unable to verify the footage. 
U.N. and Egyptian-led efforts are under way to mediate a long-term truce between Israel and Hamas that would end a four-month surge of violence along the Israel-Gaza border. 
At least 158 Palestinians have been killed in four months of weekly border protests and one Israeli soldier was shot dead by a Gaza sniper. 
Israel says Hamas, which rules Gaza, is using the protests as cover to carry out cross-border attacks. Hamas denies this. 
Palestinians militants have also fired rockets into Israel and the Israeli military has carried out dozens of air strikes in the enclave. 

Israel has lost tracts of farmland and forest to fires started by kites and helium balloons laden with incendiary material which have caused fires in Israeli forests and farmlands and flown over the border by Palestinians in Gaza.

""The cause of the evacuation of the terminal was an error by a security officer. Despite a positive test for explosives, a French family of four were allowed to leave the security zone,"" police said on Twitter.
The family were later located in the terminal, re-checked and allowed to continue on their journey. The police gave no details on what had triggered the positive explosives test.
The alarm caused the evacuation and closure of the A and Z gates of Terminal 1 at Frankfurt airport, a major hub for international travel and home to airline Lufthansa.
At 1230 GMT, the police said on Twitter that affected areas had been re-opened, allowing passengers as well as airport and airline employees to return.
Some 1,500 flights had been scheduled for taking off and landing at Frankfurt airport on Tuesday, according to airport operator Fraport.
It was not immediately clear how many flights were canceled or delayed as a result of the evacuation.
Lufthansa said it was working on a new flight plan and would provide more information later on Tuesday.

The police action came a week and a half after a security scare involving a person who passed through an unmanned checkpoint at Munich airport, Germany's second-biggest after Frankfurt. That triggered an alarm which caused the cancellation of 300 flights and affected more than 30,000 passengers.

Investigators said they had opened a criminal case against the two editors from the privately owned independent news website ""Tut.by"" and one journalist from the independent news agency BelaPAN.
Local rights groups said arrests were part of a government drive to muzzle independent media. Last year the Belarus authorities put down peaceful opposition protests in a severe crackdown which ended a brief period during which the government had eased its authoritarian rule. 
""Without the knowledge or agreement of the republican unitary enterprise (BelTA), information held on its computer system was accessed illegally more than 15,000 times over a two-year period,"" investigators said in a statement.
Andrei Bastunets, head of the Belarusian Association of Journalists, said government pressure on independent media had been on the rise in the last year.
""I link this (case) with the general trend and the desire to control the internet space,"" he said.
Ales Belyatsky, from human rights organization Viasna-96, agreed: ""This is a purposeful policy of limiting the information field in Belarus,"" he was cited as saying on the website palitviazni.info.
Investigators searched the Minsk offices of Tut.by and BelaPAN on Tuesday morning. The punishment for such a charge is either a fine r a jail term of up to two years.
Nasha niva, another independent news website, cited a representative of BelTA as saying that the detained journalists had used other people's passwords to access its news wire. 
President Alexander Lukashenko has run Belarus along Soviet-style command lines since 1994. He has heeded some calls from the West to show more leniency toward political opposition, but opponents say their freedom to operate remains severely limited.
Representatives of the BelaPAN news agency were not immediately available for comment and its web site stopped updating.
Tut.by is the biggest online news portal in the country with 800,000 daily unique users.

MORULENG, South Africa (Reuters) - A hardscrabble patch of South Africa disputed between black farmers and tribal leaders working with platinum mining interests is legal ground zero in a battle to loosen the chiefs' grip on communal lands. 
Land rights are a hot-button issue ahead of elections in 2019 as the African National Congress (ANC) moves forward with a constitutional amendment aimed at a more equitable distribution of land, including possibly expropriating land from whites without compensation.
That prospect, evoking the chaotic land grabs that wrecked the economy of neighboring Zimbabwe, has grabbed headlines and alarmed investors despite repeated pledges by President Cyril Ramaphosa that things will be different in South Africa.
A related issue is also sensitive for the ANC, however: the plight of poor blacks vulnerable to forced evictions in tribal lands because of a system of property rights that dates back to the colonial era, before apartheid.
The ""Homelands"" make up only 13 percent of the land but are home to a third of the population, 17 million blacks, mostly subsistence farmers working tiny plots. Tribal councils control these areas, often determining who gets to farm or where cattle is grazed but also access to resources like water and minerals.
Transferring that control to those who occupy or work the land would have major repercussions both for companies who have been negotiating mining rights with the tribal chiefs for decades and for politicians who count on the chiefs to deliver the local vote.
""The implication is that such communities should be the negotiating body rather than traditional councils,"" said Johan Lorenzen, a lawyer at leading human rights firm Richard Spoor Inc Attorneys.
""That would create significant legal risk for all the deals already struck with traditional councils,"" Lorenzen said. 
It may be an idea whose time has come, as protests spread and support for the ANC steadily declines in tribal areas.
At issue in the case before the Constitutional Court is a deal agreed with the council of the Bakgatla tribe to allow Pilanesberg Platinum Mines (PPM) to evict farmers in order to expand its open-pit mine onto tribal land. 
Activist David Pheto, one of the claimants, told Reuters the community was not fighting mining, but forcible evictions.
""If mining must take place we need consultation and consent because we are the owners,"" he said.
The court is expected to rule on the case late this year. 
GAME-CHANGER 
The platinum wealth below Wilgespruit farm, 160 km (100 miles) northwest of Johannesburg, is clearly more valuable than what's on top - tangled thorn scrub with almost no grass, a sign of overgrazing often seen on communal lands, set against the backdrop of jagged hills.
The elderly Grace Maledu, the lead claimant, and her neighbors say their families pooled their money to buy several hundred hectares in the area a century ago but did not get a title deed because of laws that restricted black property ownership. 
Instead, the farm was registered with a white government official who held it on behalf of the tribal chief, according to court papers filed on the farmers' behalf by the law firm Lawyers for Human Rights.
    ""We planted maize there, but it has been chopped up for the mine,"" said an agitated Maledu, pointing beyond a steel-ringed fence to the mine where massive trucks threw up clouds of dust.
PPM, a unit of unlisted Sedibelo Platinum Mines, declined to comment on the case until after the court rules.
    But in court filings, PPM and a partner company formed by the tribal council take the position that the Bakgatla community controls the farm and adjoining properties communally, with the chief as custodian. 
The company says 24 people have already relocated voluntarily, with 25,000 rand ($1,875) to each and their huts moved to nearby farms. 
The case also tests whether the deal with the tribal council trumps a 1996 law - passed during Nelson Mandela's presidency - protecting people on communal land.
""This case could be the game changer,"" said Aninka Claassens, director of the University of Cape Town's Land and Accountability Research Centre. 
""If they had obtained a title deed then they would be in a similar position to white owners who require a mining company to sign leases with them,"" she said. 
Companies like  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) Platinum and Impala Platinum may find they are ahead of the curve, having renegotiated tribal deals with wider participation and transparency after significant losses from protests.
Impala Platinum's Marula mine lost 10,000 of almost 80,000 ounces of production to protests that included road blocks and assaults on vehicles and people going to work. Falling platinum prices have added to the pressure.
Amplats says it has secured peace around its Mogalakwena operation, the world’s largest open-pit platinum mine and the Anglo American unit’s main cash spinner.
""You can never underestimate the expectations around communities and the need around communities,"" Amplats' Chief Executive Chris Griffith told Reuters.
ANOTHER WAR? 
The tribal authorities are generally seen as an important political base of the ANC, cultivated especially by former president Jacob Zuma, a traditional Zulu.
The chiefs warned the ANC in July it risked conflict if it included the homelands in its land reform drive. In a speech to supporters, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini even evoked the 19th century Anglo-Zulu war.
    ""What I want you to know about our history is that the issue we are faced with now is very similar to the one our forefathers were faced with,"" he said. ""This will be the second clash.""
In a hastily arranged meeting afterwards, Ramaphosa assured Zwelithini that the 28,000 sq km (10,810 sq miles) under his control would not be touched.
Former president Kgalema Motlanthe, who chaired a panel on land reform, has accused the chiefs of acting like ""village tin-pot dictators"".
Senior ANC officials say the party is determined to make a change in the homelands, including rolling out deeds to residents, partly because the chiefs are not delivering the vote. 
Election results in rural areas in North West province which includes the Bakgatla community and in Limpopo province where mining deals have fueled unrest show the ANC is losing support.
Backing for the ANC in these areas in 2011 ranged from 75 to 84 percent, according to official data. Nationally the party bagged 63 percent in 2011, falling to 54.5 percent in 2016.
In 2016, its support in Mabideng, where the Bakgatla live, fell to 54 percent from 75 percent in 2011. In Mogalakwena, on the restive northern limb of the platinum belt, it dropped to 64 percent from 84 percent over the same period.
""If you put these voting patterns together with evidence showing people are angry with the way chiefs use their land powers, there is a clear pattern,"" said Steven Friedman, a professor and political analyst at the University of Johannesburg.
Zolani Mkiva, General Secretary of Contralesa, the umbrella group for the traditional leaders, says homeland residents risk falling into a debt trap if they own property. 
""People will use it as collateral to access finance. And then what happens? People will have to cede land back to the finance institutions,"" he said.
Economists argue that it is precisely this state of affairs that traps people in poverty and leaves them vulnerable to eviction, however.
Critics of the ANC's land reform policy say that instead of seizing land from whites, the party should focus on reform in the homelands, which could turn millions into property owners virtually overnight.

""The government a century ago prevented us from having title deeds,"" said Pheto, the activist. ""To get the same treatment from our own government, it’s a disgrace. The chiefs are not the owners of the land.""

1661,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 08:21AM ET</span>","In a Syrian village, Turkish forces seen as shield from attack","By Khalil Ashawi
AL-SURMAN VILLAGE, Syria (Reuters) - The red Turkish flag fluttering on the outskirts of the Syrian village of al-Surman has been seen by residents as a shield against government attack since Turkish troops arrived in February. But their fears of an offensive are growing.
The village is situated in rebel-held territory near the frontline with government forces in the northwestern Idlib region, one of the last big strongholds of the opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
The seven-year-long conflict may be about to pivot again to the northwest now that Assad, backed by Russia and Iran, has crushed the rebellion across much of the rest of the country. Assad has indicated Idlib could be his next target.
The entire population of al-Surman fled the village in January during the last big government attack in the area. 
Some came back when the bombardment stopped. But most only returned once the Turks arrived to set up an observation post at its grain silos under an agreement between Turkey, Russia and Iran.
""Protection comes firstly from God, and after that it's up to the Turks,"" said Mohammad al-Youssef, 33, a resident of the village 40 km (25 miles) southeast of Idlib city.
Still, he says the Turkish presence offers only partial reassurance.
""There is constant worry because there are no promises the regime won't advance,"" he said. 
Displaced Syrians have poured into Idlib from other parts of the country recovered by Assad. The possibility of an Idlib offensive has drawn warnings of yet another humanitarian catastrophe in a war that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and driven 11 million from their homes.
The United Nations has warned that up to 2.5 million people could flee toward the Turkish border in such a scenario.
This possibility is sounding alarm bells in Turkey, which is already hosting 3.5 million Syrian refugees and fears a government offensive would drive yet more over its border.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan is pressing his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin over the issue, and has said Turkey - with NATO's second-biggest army - cannot accept an offensive in Idlib.
HOPING FOR MORE TURKISH FORCES
Near al-Surman, thousands of people uprooted by the January offensive are still living in tents in olive and fig groves.
The local economy has ground to a halt in anticipation of an offensive. Factories known for the production of woven plastic mats have shut down and home repairs are being postponed.
""People are saying we will keep our money for the days to come, in case we are displaced,"" Youssef said. 
Turkish forces have deployed at 12 observation posts in the Idlib region under the agreement reached with Russia and Iran in the Kazakh capital of Astana. Under this agreement, Idlib is considered a ""de-escalation"" zone.
Erdogan has said the Astana accord could be destroyed if the government attacks. 
The people in al-Surman are aware that their fate may hinge on international diplomacy. It gives them little comfort.
""We are awaiting conferences in the coming weeks to know Idlib's fate,"" said Khaled Daimes, 33, a factory owner. ""We can only feel at ease when the guarantees come from the Turks,"" he said. ""I hope to see the Turks in the village square.""
He wants to see Turkish forces deploy into Idlib in the same kind of numbers they have sent into areas north of Aleppo. There, Turkey has carved out a de facto buffer zone outside any stated agreements with Russia or Iran.
Assad views the Turks as illegal occupiers and has vowed to recover ""every inch"" of Syria. Russia's priorities, particularly its relationship with Turkey, are key to determining Idlib's fate, analysts say.
Rebel commanders believe an offensive inevitable. This assessment has been hardened by the recent campaign in the southwestern region near Israel and Jordan, recovered by the government in a Russian-backed assault in a matter of weeks.
That region had also been declared a de-escalation zone in an agreement between the United States and Russia.
The commander of the rebel group Ahrar al-Sharqia said he was 90 percent certain that the government would attack Idlib once its offensive in the southwest is finished.
""We are working to prepare our fighters,"" the commander, Abu Hatem Shaqra, said.

Asked whether Turkey would stand by rebels in the event of an attack, he said: ""I can't answer this question clearly. On one level, the Turkish brothers have many statements that Idlib is a red line. But on the ground nothing is clear.""

The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) on Tuesday said it would deploy a team to collect additional samples, to be analyzed in two laboratories designated by the agency.
In July the British government asked the OPCW to independently identify a substance which the authorities had found to be Novichok -- the same nerve agent used to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in March.
Britain blamed Russia for the Skripal poisoning but the Kremlin denied involvement.
In June, two Britons fell ill in Amesbury after being exposed to the poison in southwest England, close to where the Skripals were attacked. One of them died.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Just after 10:30 on a sunny August morning in downtown Nairobi, 48-year-old Ali Mwadama was walking toward a bank opposite the U.S. embassy, a cheque in hand. 
He was less than 50 meters (yards) from the embassy on Aug. 7, 1998 when a truck bomb detonated, transforming the normally bustling business district into a war zone. 
It was Osama bin Laden's announcement to the world that his al Qaeda was a global threat: a coordinated bombing of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and neighboring Tanzania. 
The two bombings killed 258 people, the majority in Nairobi. Three years later, al Qaeda would conduct its most notorious attack, flying passenger planes into New York's World Trade Center and the Pentagon, killing some 3,000 people.
Mwadama does not remember who pulled him out of the rubble, bleeding from a gash in his neck caused by a flying shard of glass. He recalls hearing screams and ambulance sirens.
People in bloodsoaked clothing were carried on makeshift stretchers past what was left of the embassy. 
He lost two friends that day, his livelihood as a voiceover artist and public speaker, and the cheque he was going to cash, earned for voicing a Coca-Cola ad aired during the 1998 soccer World Cup. 
Twenty years later, he struggles to turn his head to the left. A scar runs from the below the grey hair on the back of his head to the bottom of his ear. 
Other scars run deeper. 
""Wherever I go, wherever I sit, I am so afraid of anything that could attack me,"" he told Reuters, holding a photograph taken of him after the attack.
In it, he stares blankly at a wall, a bloody bandage covering his 26 stitches, his three children watching with concerned expressions.
THUNDEROUS BANG
Civil servant Julie Ogoye was talking to a colleague in their fourth floor Nairobi office when she heard a strange noise outside.
""I think I only went two steps, then I heard a very loud thunderous bang,"" she said. ""And what I saw was a silverish white cloud moving up.""
That was the last thing she saw in a long time.
For a few seconds there was silence. Then came the groans. 
Ogoye got up, helped by a colleague, and stumbled in blindness over debris and what she later learned were dead bodies.
""When I lifted my hand and put it on the socket, I noticed it was an empty socket. My eyeball was hanging at the nose area,"" she recalled. The shock made her pass out.
Her sight partially returned in her right eye. The left socket was filled with a prosthesis.
Ogoye is not eager to forget. 
At the weekend, she visited the former site of the embassy, now the August 7th Memorial Park.
""This park. It was rubble and blood and a stinking place, but they have transformed it into a beautiful place,"" she said.

""To me it is symbolic. Bad things can happen, but good things conquer bad things.""

KAYANGAN, Indonesia (Reuters) - The death toll from a powerful earthquake that hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok topped 100 on Tuesday as rescuers found victims under wrecked buildings, while thousands left homeless in the worst-affected areas waited for aid to arrive.
A woman was pulled alive from the rubble of a collapsed grocery store in the north, near the epicenter of Sunday's 6.9 magnitude quake, the second tremor to rock the tropical island in a week.
That was a rare piece of good news as hopes of finding more survivors faded and a humanitarian crisis loomed for thousands left homeless by the disaster in the rural area and in desperate need of clean water, food, medicine and shelter.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman of Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency (BNPB) put the toll at 105, including two on the neighboring island of Bali to the west, where the quake was also felt - and the figure was expected to rise.
Lombok had already been hit by a 6.4 magnitude earthquake on July 29 that killed 17 people and briefly stranded several hundred trekkers on the slopes of a volcano.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes. In 2004, the Indian Ocean tsunami killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.

THOUSANDS SCATTERED ON HILLS
Few buildings were left standing in Kayangan on the island's northern end, where residents told Reuters that as many as 40 died.
Some villagers used sledgehammers and ropes to start clearing the rubble of broken homes, but others, traumatized by continued aftershocks, were too afraid to venture far from tents and tarpaulins set up in open spaces.
There has been little government relief for the area, where the greatest need is for water and food, as underground water sources have been blocked by the quake and shops destroyed or abandoned.
About 75 percent of the north has been without electricity since Sunday, officials said, and some communities were hard to reach because bridges were damaged and trees, rocks and sand lay across roads cracked wide open in places by the tremor.
""Thousands of people moved to scattered locations,"" Sutopo told a news conference in Jakarta.
""People have moved to the hillsides where they feel safer. It's difficult for help to reach them. We advise people to come down and move closer to the camps.""
Aid agency Oxfam said it was providing clean drinking water and tarpaulin shelters to 5,000 survivors, but the need was much greater, with more than 20,000 estimated to have been displaced.
""Thousands ... are under open skies in need of drinking water, food, medical supplies, and clothes,"" it said in a statement. ""Clean drinking water is scarce due to the extremely dry weather."" 
Villagers in Pemenang on Lombok's northwestern shoulder heard cries for help emerging from the mangled concrete of a collapsed minimart on Tuesday and alerted rescuers. Four hours later they pulled out alive Nadia Revanale, 23.
""First we used our hands to clear the debris, then hammers, chisels and machines,"" Marcos Eric, a volunteer, told Reuters. ""It took many hours but we're thankful it worked and this person was found alive.""
Rescuers heard a weak voice coming from under the wreckage of a nearby two-storey mosque, where four people were believed to have been trapped when the building pancaked.
""We are looking for access. We have a machine that can drill or cut through concrete, so we may use that. We are waiting for heavier equipment,"" Teddy Aditya, an official of the Indonesian Search and Rescue Agency (Basarnas), told Reuters.
TOURIST EXODUS
Thousands of tourists have left Lombok since Sunday evening, fearing further earthquakes, some on extra flights added by airlines and some on ferries to Bali. 
Officials said about 4,600 foreign and domestic tourists had been evacuated from the three Gili islands off the northwest coast of Lombok, where two people died and fears of a tsunami spread soon after the quake.
Saffron Amis, a British student on Gili Trawangan - the largest of the islands fringed by white beaches and surrounded by turquoise sea - said at least 200 people were stranded there with more flowing in from the other two, Gili Air and Gili Meno.

""We still have no wi-fi and very little power. Gili Air has run out of food and water so they have come to us,"" she told Reuters in a text message, adding later that she had been taken by boat to the main island en route to Bali.

Magistrate Francis Vhitorini granted $50 bail to each of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) members.
""The court has indicated that it did not consider any of them to be a flight risk. The judgment was so brilliant that we are still trying to process it,"" MDC lawyer Denford Halimani said.
Violence erupted last week after President Emmerson Mnangagwa and his ruling ZANU-PF party won a national election. The MDC disputes the outcome and says the vote was rigged.
Six people were killed in an army clampdown on protests in scenes reminiscent of the long and heavy-handed rule of Robert Mugabe. Mnangagwa replaced Mugabe when he was toppled last year in a de facto military coup.
Nelson Chamisa, Mnangagwa's main rival, is expected to mount a court challenge against the election result this week. The MDC has said security forces were abducting its members in night raids to intimidate the party and stop it challenging Mnangagwa's win in the presidential vote.
Zimbabwe's foreign minister denied those accusations, telling diplomats that if there was any evidence the military would investigate the cases.
The Criminal Investigations Department said in a statement police were looking for former finance minister and opposition figure Tendai Biti, MDC chairman Morgen Komichi and MDC youth leader Happymore Chidziva linked to last week's violence.
Zimbabweans had hoped the vote would rid the country of its global pariah status and launch an economic recovery, but have watched an all too familiar pattern where the ruling party is declared the winner and the opposition rejects the outcome.

Under the constitution, a losing presidential candidate has 7 days from when a winner is declared to challenge the result at the Constitutional Court. The Court must rule within 14 days. Mnangagwa's inauguration would have to wait for the outcome of a court challenge.

KNOTTINGLEY, England (Reuters) - To Paul Green, a club steward in northern England's 'rust belt', Britain is so broken that he would vote for Brexit again were he to get another chance.
Green, who runs a Miners' Welfare Club in an area where there are no longer any working miners, says both of Britain's main political parties have shown no interest in the Yorkshire town of Knottingley for generations.
""It's desperate really - I feel that Knottingley is a forgotten community, and all the surrounding areas are forgotten communities as well, through lack of investment and red tape,"" he said, standing in a youth boxing gym at the club.
The 55-year-old former railwayman is not alone. Such anger drove many Britons to vote to leave the European Union in 2016, though tumult in the Brexit process has prompted some supporters of EU membership to call for a rerun of the referendum.
With Britain due to leave on March 29, 2019, the country, its politicians and its business leaders remain deeply divided over Brexit. Recent opinion polls show voters think Prime Minister Theresa May is handling the process badly and there may be a slight move toward support for staying in the EU.
May, who has ruled out another referendum, is trying to clinch a Brexit divorce deal with Brussels that pleases both sides of her divided Conservative Party as well as the Northern Irish kingmakers who prop up her minority government.
""SHAMBOLIC JOKE""
Local people complain there are few jobs in Knottingley. Like many areas in northern England, it has been left behind by a global economy that has brought cheaper coal imports from the likes of Colombia and Russia, and a push toward generating power from cleaner gas and wind turbines. 
Unemployment in Yorkshire and neighboring Humberside is 4.5 percent, only slightly more than the national rate. But while the county includes the vibrant city of Leeds and the prosperous spa town of Harrogate, life is tougher in the old mining areas.
Green's club originally catered for workers at Kellingley Colliery just outside the town, which was Britain's last deep coal mine. It closed in 2015, leaving only open cast operations as a remnant of the country's once dominant coal industry.

Goole port, 30 km (20 miles) to the east, once shipped British coal out. Now it imports bricks, vegetable oil and timber from Europe and beyond.

The Mexico City-bound Embraer 190 passenger jet smashed into scrubland near the runway shortly after take-off during what passengers have described as strong winds, hail and rain. All 103 passengers and crew survived by evacuating from the plane before it caught fire.
At least 65 passengers aboard Aeromexico Flight 2341 were U.S. citizens, including many residents from the Chicago area.
""All of the people on this flight have the right to know exactly what caused the plane to crash. A plane just doesn't drop from the sky because it's raining hard,"" said Corboy & Demetrio co-founder Thomas A. Demetrio. 
Aeromexico did not return requests for comment.
Luis Gerardo Fonseca, director of Mexico's civil aviation agency, told Radio Formula on Monday the causes of the crash were still being investigated.
The first officer and the two flight attendants on board the plane have already given their declarations as part of the investigation, he said. Investigators were waiting to interview the captain, who is still being treated in hospital, Fonseca said.
Corboy & Demetrio said it filed six separate lawsuits on behalf of 11 passengers with the Cook County Circuit Court in Illinois. 
Francis Patrick Murphy, another partner at the firm, said weather, to some extent, is always a factor in flight operations.

""However, safe flight operations depend on how the airline and its pilots monitor, respond to and correct for severe weather conditions, both in the pre-flight and inter-flight decision-making process, in order to avoid a mishap,"" Murphy said.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Security forces temporarily blocked the entrance to Nigeria's parliament on Tuesday, preventing lawmakers and others from entering for up to an hour, witnesses said.
Witnesses said armed men wearing the black uniform of the Department of State Security stood at the gates of the building, where they were later joined by police officers. 
A Reuters witness said security agents, some of whom were masked, then allowed lawmakers to enter but continued to bar government agents and journalists. 
A senior aide to Senate President Bukola Saraki was among a number of people who tweeted pictures and video from outside the National Assembly building. One showed the arrival of police outside the building and another showed a man, described as a senator, talking to a man flanked by an armed man. 
A Nigeria Police Force spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. 
Saraki, whose Senate role makes him Nigeria's third most senior politician, is among a group of lawmakers who have quit President Muhammadu Buhari's ruling party over the last few weeks and joined the main opposition. 
The defections precede presidential and legislative elections early next year. 

Buhari plans to seek a second term in the February 2019 presidential vote but the loss of influential figures and divisions within his party could cost him support from powerful patronage networks and among voters.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A Japanese medical school deliberately cut women's entrance test scores for several years, a panel of lawyers hired by the school to investigate the issue said on Tuesday, calling it a ""very serious"" instance of discrimination.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has made a priority of creating a society ""where women can shine"", but women in Japan still face an uphill battle in employment and face hurdles returning to work after childbirth, which contributes to a falling birthrate.
The alterations were uncovered in an internal investigation of a graft accusation this spring regarding the entrance exam for Tokyo Medical University, sparking protests and widespread anger following media reports last week.
Lawyers investigating bribery accusations in the admission of the son of a senior education ministry official said they concluded that his score and that of several other men were boosted ""unfairly"" - some by as much as 49 points.
They also concluded that scores were manipulated to give men more points than women and thus hold down the number of women admitted.
""This incident is really regrettable - by deceptive recruitment procedures, they sought to delude the test takers, their families, school officials and society as a whole,"" lawyer Kenji Nakai told a news conference.
""Factors suggesting very serious discrimination against women was also part of it,"" added Nakai, one of the external lawyers hired by the university to investigate the incident.
The investigation showed the scores of men - including those reappearing after failing once or twice - were raised a certain number of points. Those of all women, and men who had failed the test at least three times, were not, however.
The lawyers said they did not know how many women had been affected, but it appeared that women's test scores had been affected going back at least a decade.
Medical school authorities have called a news conference for 5 p.m. No immediate comment was available from the government or the education ministry official who figures in the case.
Entrance exam discrimination against women was ""absolutely unacceptable"", Education Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters last week, however.
Reports of the incident appeared at the start of August, setting off a furore in Japan, spurring women to recount their own experiences of discrimination on social media with the hashtag, ""It's okay to be angry about sexism."" 
Some referred to the potential costs exacted in a rapidly aging society. 
""I'm 29 and will probably never get married,"" said one poster.
""Women are pitied if they don't, but Japanese women who are married and working and have kids end up sleeping less than anybody in the world. To now hear that even our skills are suppressed makes me shake with rage.""
Another said,""I ignored my parents, who said women don't belong in academia, and got into the best university in Japan. But in job interviews I'm told 'If you were a man, we'd hire you right away.'
""My enemy wasn't my parents, but all society itself.""

JAKARTA (Reuters) - An elderly village witch doctor in Indonesia entrapped a 12-year-old girl and tricked her into having sex with him for the next 15 years by claiming to be possessed by the ""jin"", or spirit, of a young boy, police said on Tuesday.
The woman, an identified by police as ""H"", was rescued on Sunday in Tolitoli regency, in Central Sulawesi province. 
Acting on a tip-off, police said they had found the woman, who was now aged 28, in a rocky crevice in a jungle near Bajugan village, where she had been held during the day since her disappearance in 2003.
At night, police said she stayed in a hut near the house of the 83-year old man, identified by police as JG.
Central Sulawesi Police Chief Muhammad Iqbal Alqudusy said the man had shown the girl a picture of a boy named Amrin ""who she thought was her boyfriend"".
""She was led to believe that Amrin's spirit had entered (the elderly man's) body,"" Iqbal said on Tuesday at a news conference that was posted online. ""It is obvious that he was satisfying his lust.""
Indonesia is a predominantly Muslim country but old beliefs about spirits and other paranormal activity are still held by some.
Iqbal later told Reuters the woman said she had been having intercourse with ""Jin Amrin"" since 2003 ""but she was really having sex with JG"".
The man, he said, admitted to sexual relations since 2008.
Police said they found the woman after her sister alerted neighbours she was nearby.
According to the Jakarta Post, the sister was married to the son of the shaman, known for his traditional healing methods and abilities to channel spirits.
The man explained the victim's disappearance to her parents by saying she had gone to Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, to work, the newspaper reported. 
The man has been charged with offences under Indonesia's child protection laws, which carry a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison.

Najib has been asked to appear at the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) office at 5 p.m. (0900 GMT), a report on the website of The Star daily said. He will be released after MACC records his statement, it said. 
One source aware of the matter confirmed the news report, but offered no further details. MACC and Najib's spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Najib was arrested and charged in Malaysia last month with abuse of power and criminal breach of trust related to an alleged transfer of 42 million ringgit ($10.31 million) into his personal bank account from SRC International, a former unit of state fund 1MDB. 
He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and was released after posting bail. He is scheduled to attend a pre-trial hearing in court on Wednesday.
Najib and his family has faced intense scrutiny since a shock defeat in a May election by his former mentor-turned-foe, Mahathir Mohamad, who reopened an investigation into 1MDB after becoming prime minister.
1MDB is being investigated by at least six countries, including Singapore, Switzerland and the United States, over alleged money laundering and graft.
The U.S. Department of Justice says an estimated $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB by high-level officials of the fund and their associates.

Najib and his wife Rosmah Mansor have been barred from leaving the country.

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said the lease contract that Landing signed with a state-owned foundation in March has significantly put the government at a disadvantage because the rental payment was ""unconscionable"".
""Sorry to burst your bubble, people, but the president said that is grossly disadvantageous to the government,"" Roque told a media briefing, few minutes after Landing broke ground for what could have been the fifth casino project in the country's smaller version of the Las Vegas strip. 

The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp, a government-owned and controlled firm under the Office of the President, granted Landing the license to build the project in July. The project, which will include hotels, a convention center, water parks and gambling areas composed of 155 tables and 239 slot machines and electronic table games, was slated to start commercial operations in 2022. Landing officials were not immediately available for comment. Shares of the firm were up 4 percent as of 0707 GMT, outstripping the broader index that was up 1.6 percent. In April, the government also shelved a plan by Macau's Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd to build a $500 million integrated casino-resort on the holiday island of Boracay, just a month after the gaming regulator approved the project.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea released a South Korean citizen detained in July after crossing the border into the North, the South's Unification Ministry said on Tuesday.
The prisoner was a 34-year-old man surnamed Seo who was detained after ""illegally"" entering North Korea last month, the ministry said.
South Korean officials have pressed for the return of six other South Koreans believed to have been held for years in North Korea, and the Unification Ministry said they believed Seo's release is a positive sign.
In May, North Korea released three American prisoners in a gesture seen as clearing the way for June's summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump.
After the Americans were released, the United Nations human rights investigator on North Korea, Tomas Ojea Quintana, issued a statement calling for the South Koreans to also be freed.
Among them are Christian missionaries Kim Jung-wook, who was arrested in October 2013, and Kim Kook-kie and Choi Chun-kil, who have been held since 2014, the ministry said.
The other three are North Korean defectors who South Korea’s National Intelligence Service said last year were “captured” by the North without specifying where and why.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's population will hit a record 25 million on Tuesday, almost a decade earlier than projected, as it attracts hundreds of thousands of migrants each year, latest government data shows. 
Every minute, one person arrives to live in Australia, the data shows, underpinning demand for everything from homes to cars, schools and hospitals, and boosting the country's economic fortunes. 
The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates the country's population will reach 26 million in three years' time, based on current trends.
The rapid increase in migrant numbers has sparked a debate on the economic and social impact of migration given inadequate infrastructure has resulted in clogged cities while an expanding labor market has capped wage growth.
""Coping means continuing to invest in infrastructure,"" Treasurer Scott Morrison said on 3AW Radio on Tuesday, when asked if Australia can cope with 25 million people.
""That's why we've got a A$75 billion infrastructure plan. There has to be to support that growth that we're seeing in our population.""
Australia's economic success is built on migration with more than a third of the population born overseas, according to the latest census data which shows England, China, New Zealand and India as the top countries where migrants come from. 
A separate ABS study released in June shows net overseas migration now accounts for 62 percent of total population growth. Natural increase makes up 38 percent.
But immigration has become a political hot potato as the ruling centre-right coalition government and the opposition Labor party start campaigning for the New South Wales state election due next March followed by national elections in May.
Far right politician Pauline Hanson has blamed the rising migrant numbers for growing inequality in Australia, while Senator Dean Smith became the first member of the government earlier this year to call for a review into population growth.
Smith has argued the rapid intake has put a huge strain on the infrastructure of the country's largest cities - Sydney and Melbourne - home to the vast majority of newcomers.

""The 25 million milestone is a perfect opportunity to engage in a broad public discussion about what future population growth should look like for Australia and how that can be balanced with preserving high living standards and quality of life,"" Smith told Reuters.

Thailand is in the middle of its rainy season which often generates flash storms. The Meteorological Department said more storms are expected between Aug 7-9.
Thailand suffered its worst floods in half a century in 2011. The floods killed more than 900 people, crippled industry and dented economic growth.

Mnangagwa has urged Zimbabweans to unite after he was declared the first elected head of state since Robert Mugabe's removal from power, but the opposition leader has insisted he won and has pledged to challenge the result.
China has close economic and diplomatic ties with Zimbabwe, which it has been keen to maintain after Mugabe's ouster last November in a de facto coup that brought his former ally Mnangagwa to power.
""In a congratulatory message dated Sunday, Xi expressed his wishes that the Zimbabwean government and people would make more achievements in national development under Mnangagwa's leadership,"" Xinhua said.
Xi expects to meet Mnangagwa next month when he visits Beijing for a summit of Chinese and African leaders, it added.
""Xi said he hoped the meeting with Mnangagwa in Beijing could push forward the comprehensive strategic partnership of cooperation between the two countries.""
On Monday, Zimbabwe's main opposition said security forces were abducting its members in night raids to intimidate the party and stop it challenging Mnangagwa's win.

Opposition leader Nelson Chamisa has rejected Mnangagwa's victory, and has promised to use legal and constitutional means to challenge the outcome.

DAKAR (Reuters) - Three Congo Republic peacekeepers were given sentences of just three years in jail for murdering civilians and are now already free, Human Rights Watch said on Tuesday, describing the sentences as inadequate and unlikely to discourage future abuse.
A court in the Congolese capital Brazzaville sentenced each of the soldiers in April for the killings of 11 civilians committed in 2014 while the soldiers were serving in an African Union peacekeeping mission in Central African Republic. HRW said it secured a copy of the written judgment only last month.
The three men are now free, having already served most of their sentences, HRW said in a statement. Although the court found the soldiers guilty of war crimes which can carry the death penalty under Congolese law, its judgment cited unspecified extenuating circumstances.
""The authorities in the Republic of Congo missed an opportunity to provide justice for the murders of civilians and to show that no peacekeeper is above the law,"" said Lewis Mudge, a senior researcher at HRW. 
""Giving the soldiers who committed murder little more than a slap on the wrist sent a damaging message to other peacekeepers that they risk little if they commit such crimes.""
Congo's government spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. The government of President Denis Sassou Nguesso, one of Africa's most secretive with a history of repression at home, has previously rejected claims that it has ignored allegations of human rights abuses against its soldiers. 
Failure to hold peacekeepers accountable for crimes committed on foreign soil is a recurring complaint of rights activists. The responsibility to prosecute falls on troop-contributing countries who are often unwilling or unable to press charges against their troops.
According to HRW, the Congolese peacekeepers killed an unarmed boy and arrested at least 12 other civilians in the Central African town of Boali in March 2014 after a peacekeeper was killed in a firefight with a local militia leader. 
The bodies of the 12 people were found nearby in a mass grave in February 2016. The remains of a 7-month-old baby who was also killed were never found, HRW said. The Congolese court judgment referred only to 11 of the victims.
Congo Republic's hundreds of peacekeepers in Central African Republic later became part of a U.N. mission. They were repatriated last year following multiple allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation.

Despite being jailed in April on a corruption conviction and sentenced to 12 years in prison, Lula was nominated by his Workers Party on Saturday to press its point that his conviction was political persecution aimed at stopping Brazil's most influential politician from returning to power.
The country's top electoral court is expected to invalidate his candidacy when it is registered on the Aug. 15 deadline and the party has picked former Sao Paulo mayor Fernando Haddad as running mate to stand in for Lula if needed.
Haddad said on Monday Lula had asked for the release petition to be dropped because of the risk that the top court would decide simultaneously that he was ineligible to run for office under an anti-corruption law. If the top court ruled, the electoral court would not be able to consider his case.
By registering his candidacy at the last minute next week, the former leftist leader aims to keep Brazilian's attention on his case as long as possible, helping to transfer his popular support into votes for his party.
""It was a request for his release, but it appears that the petition was going to be used to rule on his eligibility in the election,"" Haddad told reporters after visiting Lula in his prison in the southern city of Curitiba.
""Lula has always said he will not trade his dignity for freedom,"" said Haddad, who is a lawyer and was added to the former president's defense team so that he could visit Lula regularly in jail.
Lula governed Brazil for two terms from 2003-2010 and left office with a record approval rating of 87 percent thanks to a booming economy and social programs that lifted millions of Brazilians from poverty. 
His popularity has been hurt by corruption indictments and scandals involving his party, which was ousted from power in 2016 when his hand-picked successor was impeached for breaking budget rules.

Still, polls show about one third of Brazilians would vote for him if he is allowed to run — almost double his nearest adversary, far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro — and many of his supporters will vote for whomever replaces him in the race.

Relations between the two countries have steadily worsened, strained by differences on Syria policy and over the trial of U.S. pastor Andrew Brunson in Turkey. A trade spat between the two sent Turkey's lira currency to plunge to a record low on Monday.
Over the weekend, the U.S. Trade Representative said it was reviewing Turkey's duty-free access to the U.S. market, after Ankara imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods in response to American tariffs on steel and aluminum. The move could affect $1.7 billion of Turkish exports.
On Tuesday, CNN Turk cited diplomatic sources saying that Ankara and Washington had reached pre-agreements on certain issues, but it did not elaborate.
The Turkish government was not immediately available for comment, and the U.S. State Department did not respond to a request for comment.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has demanded that Turkey release Brunson, an evangelical pastor who has lived in Turkey for more than two decades and has been charged with supporting a group that Ankara has blamed for an attempted coup in 2016. He has denied the accusations.
Last week, Washington imposed sanctions on President Tayyip Erdogan's justice minister and interior minister, saying they played leading roles in organizations responsible for Brunson's arrest.
Erdogan said that Turkey would retaliate by freezing assets of the U.S. interior and justice ministers in Turkey ""if they have any.""
The Turkish currency, which has lost 27 percent of its value this year, fell some 5.5 percent to a record low of 5.4250 against the dollar on Monday, its biggest single-day drop in nearly 10 years.

Hundreds of Venezuelans continued to walk across into Brazil, a border official said.
Federal judge Helder Barreto on Sunday ordered the border closed until the frontier state of Roraima can create ""humanitarian"" conditions to receive the massive and disorderly influx. But the injunction has not gone into effect yet pending an appeal by Brazilian government lawyers. 
Over the last three years, tens of thousands of Venezuelans have arrived in Roraima, overwhelming social services and causing a humanitarian crisis with families sleeping in the streets amid rising crime and prostitution.
The state government on Thursday decreed Venezuelans seeking medical and other social services in Roraima would have to present a valid passport, which many of the refugees do not have.
Barreto ruled that such a measure was ""discriminatory"" and countered Brazilian laws. He suspended a provision that would allow the deportation or expulsion of Venezuelan immigrants who committed illegal acts and ordered the vaccination of those admitted to Brazil.
However, he ordered the suspension of the entry of Venezuelans into Roraima until the state can reach an equilibrium between the arrival of migrants and their exit to other parts of Brazil.
Following recommendations by the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR, the Brazilian Air Force in early May began airlifting Venezuelan immigrants from Roraima for resettlement in other cities of Brazil.
To date, some 820 Venezuelans have been flown out of Boa Vista, the state capital, by the Air Force. But state officials say more than 500 Venezuelans cross into Brazil every day on average and many stay in Roraima because they cannot afford to move on.

Brazil's federal government has declined requests by Roraima's governor to close the border. Solicitor General Grace Mendonça renewed an appeal to the Supreme Court on Monday to suspend the state decree restricting services for Venezuelans, saying it interfered with federal powers.

Simone Gbagbo, the wife of former president Laurent Gbagbo, was one of 800 citizens that Ouattara said he had pardoned, in a state address broadcast live on TV.
She had been tried and convicted in 2015 and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Last year, an Abidjan court acquitted her of crimes against humanity and war crimes linked to her role in the 2011 civil war that killed about 3,000 people. Human Rights groups criticized that decision.
""Because of my commitment to peace and true reconciliation, I proceeded to sign this day an amnesty order ... which will benefit 800 of our citizens,"" Ouattara said in the address that seemed to be aimed at cooling political tensions.
Ivory Coast is Francophone West Africa's largest, most successful and diverse economy. But its combustible politics - turbocharged by ongoing ethnic and land disputes and scores to settle from a decade-long crisis - makes an election scheduled for 2020 potentially perilous. 
Besides Simone Gbagbo, another beneficiary was Kamagate Souleymane, a former rebel when Laurent Gbagbo was in power, and who is close to national assembly leader Guillaume Soro. 
Soro's rebel movement claims credit for helping Ouattara come to power after Gbagbo refused to accept defeat in an election, triggering the short but brutal 2011 civil war for which Laurent Gbagbo is currently on trial in the International Criminal Court (ICC).
Political tensions are heating up ahead of elections in 2020. Ouattara's ruling RDR coalition has fallen out with the coalition's junior partner, the PDCI, whose leader expelled party members named to a new Cabinet last month.
There have also been doubts over whether Ouattara will step down after two terms, as required by the constitution, although in his address on Monday he repeated a remark made last month that he would ""work to transfer power to a new generation"".

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentine prosecutors questioned a construction executive related to President Mauricio Macri on Monday as part of a sprawling investigation into bribe payments made to the former government, a person close to the case told Reuters.
Angelo Calcaterra, the former head of construction company Iecsa and Macri's cousin, told prosecutors he was told by officials in former President Cristina Fernandez' administration to pay cash in exchange for public works contracts, said the source on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing probe.
""The pressure was strong,"" the person said. Calcaterra could not be reached for comment.
Calcaterra is the latest executive to speak with prosecutors in the case since last Wednesday, when newspaper La Nacion published contents of notebooks kept by a driver in the former administration that detail how he transported bribe money from construction companies to government officials from 2005-2015.
Journalist Diego Cabot wrote in La Nacion over the weekend that he was given the notebooks in January by Jorge Bacigalupo, an acquaintance of the driver, Oscar Centeno. In a video interview with Cabot posted on La Nacion's website, Bacigalupo said Centeno gave him the notebooks in September or October. 
Cabot wrote that he made copies of the notebooks and then gave them to prosecutors in April. La Nacion decided not to publish the story until law enforcement acted on the information, he added.
Prosecutor Carlos Stornelli is probing what he calls the ""criminal conspiracy to illegally raise money"" outlined in the notebooks. ""They hold an abundance of data and provide a kind of x-ray of the system,"" Stornelli told local radio.
Stornelli's office declined to comment. 
More than a dozen former government officials and business executives have been arrested since Wednesday, according to local media reports. Executives for some of the companies named, including Electroingenieria SA and Albanesi SA, have taken leaves of absence, according to securities filings. 
On Monday Techint, one of the country's top conglomerates, said in a statement that it had answered questions from prosecutors and would continue cooperating after its offices were raided last week. It also promised an internal probe. 
Shares of its Ternium unit, which provides steel for construction projects, fell 5.8 percent to 14.75 ARS (54 cents) per share.
Ratings agency Moody's said in a statement that the ""corruption scandal is credit negative for Argentine corporations."" It cited ""bribery investigations that led to the arrest of senior Argentine business leaders.""
The scandal threatens to complicate a possible presidential campaign next year by Fernandez, who has been indicted in other graft cases but enjoys immunity from arrest as a senator.
A spokesman for Fernandez declined to comment on the current case, and she has denied any wrongdoing in the past.

Press reports said Agyarko was removed because Akufo-Addo was unhappy with his handling of an agreement to extend an existing five-year deal with United Arab Emirates-based AMERI Energy to operate a 300MW emergency power plant. 
The deal has been controversial in Ghana, with critics balking at a price tag of more than half a billion dollars.
Akufo-Addo asked Agyarko to hand over his office to the minister of Lands and Natural Resources, John Peter Amew, until a new appointment is made, the statement said.
The West African country became an energy producer in late 2010, and produces around 180,000 barrels per day mainly from three main fields, which also produce most of Ghana's gas for power generation.

But intermittent power cuts have been a headache for the government, as demand consistently surges ahead of supply.

(Reuters) - Pope Francis recognized on Monday measures that Chile's bishops said they would take to assist prosecutors investigating allegations of sex abuse that have plagued the Roman Catholic Church in Chile, including that they would work to reach an agreement with prosecutors on an exchange of information. 
The pontiff wrote in a letter released to media on Monday by the Chilean Church that the steps taken at a conclave last week were ""realistic and concrete"" and that he was confident they would make a ""decisive"" difference.
After a week-long leadership conclave, the bishops asked for forgiveness, saying in a statement on Friday that they had failed to aid and accompany victims who had suffered ""grave sins and injustices committed by priests and clergy.""
Fernando Ramos, secretary-general of the Episcopal Conference, said last Friday that they also wanted ""to reach an agreement [with prosecutors] to assure a fluid exchange of information, one that meets our standards, as well as the requirements of the Public Ministry."" 
Chilean law enforcement is investigating 38 accusations of sexual abuse against 73 bishops, clerics and lay workers, involving 104 victims. 
""I was impressed by the reflection, discernment and decisions that were made,"" the pope wrote. ""But what struck me most was the example of a unified episcopal community. Thank you for this edifying example."" 
Chilean prosecutors said last week that they had asked the government to submit a formal request to the Vatican for information about nine clergymen and lay workers who have been accused of sexual abuse of children. 

""We will make public every prior investigation into alleged sexual abuse of children that has occurred in our jurisdictions. We will ask the same of officials at all religious congregations,"" Santiago Silva, president of the Episcopal Conference, told reporters last week.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia said on Monday it had summoned Greece's ambassador to Moscow and told him it was responding in kind to what it called an unfriendly decision by Athens to expel two Russian diplomats.
Greece said in July it had expelled two Russian diplomats and barred two other people from entering the country for trying to bribe officials and foment demonstrations to thwart a deal to allow Macedonia to join NATO.
Russia flatly denied the allegations. 
The Macedonia issue is sensitive in Greece, where political stability is pivotal as the country emerges from a huge debt crisis. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' fragile left-right coalition recently lost two lawmakers who quit after a deal between Athens and Skopje to rename Macedonia, bringing his parliamentary majority to 152 out of a total of 300 seats.
Greece's decision to expel the Russian diplomats plunged relations between Moscow and Athens, which have religious and cultural links spanning centuries, into a rare crisis.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said on Monday it had hit back, summoning Greek Ambassador to Moscow Andreas Friganas and handing him a note informing him ""of tit-for-tat measures taken by the Russian side.""
The ministry, in its statement, did not name the Greek diplomats it had expelled or say when it had asked them to leave.
However, Russia's state-backed RIA news agency cited an unnamed source as saying Moscow had expelled Greece's trade representative as well as a Greek diplomatic employee responsible for the country's communications policy in Russia.
A senior official from Greece's Foreign Ministry had also been banned from entering Russia, RIA cited the same source as saying.
Russia's ambassador to Greece called the original allegations against Russian diplomats ""nonsense"" and accused Athens of acting without evidence, while the Russian Foreign Ministry warned of unspecified consequences.
That prompted its Greek counterpart to tell Moscow to stop interfering in the domestic affairs of a foreign country. 
Following the initial diplomatic expulsions, Greece said it still sought good relations with Russia.
However, ties have only deteriorated since, and Russia's ambassador to Athens was reported as saying last month that the timing of a planned visit to Greece by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in September was no longer suitable.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan government sympathizers on Monday rallied to show support for President Nicolas Maduro following weekend drone blasts that he called an assassination attempt, but the socialist leader surprised the crowd by skipping the event. 
Maduro, whose approval ratings hover around 25 percent, with opponents blaming his policies for worsening an economic meltdown, has urged supporters to unite in the face of what he described as right-wing plots led by the Colombian government and exiles in the United States.
Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has scoffed at the accusations, saying he was fully focused on his granddaughter's baptism, while U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said Washington was not involved in the blasts.
Supporters wearing t-shirts emblazoned with Maduro's face massed in Caracas on Monday, chanting pro-socialist slogans and enjoying subsidized corn patties. 
""We're willing to defend this process peacefully and through the development of ideas. But if we have to give our lives, we will,"" said Henry Jaimes, 37, an employee of Caracas' Youth Institute, as he waved a sign saying, ""Alive and winning with Maduro."" 
But turnout was thin compared to previous marches, which would take over major avenues. Many in attendance were public sector employees, some of whom said they had been ordered to attend, according to Reuters witnesses. Keen supporters of late leader Hugo Chavez have increasingly soured on his far less charismatic successor. 
Maduro, who made a televised speech shortly after the incident, had been due to speak from the Miraflores palace on Monday afternoon. 
It was not immediately clear why he did not. The Information Ministry did not reply to a request for comment.
""Where is our comandante (leader)?"" confused supporters asked when staff began packing up. 
""We thought we would see and hear our president,"" said Tony Ugarte, 43, who is in charge of the distribution of subsidized food boxes in part of the working class neighborhood of El Paraiso.
The government said suspects launched two DJI M600 drones laden with C4 explosives over an outdoor rally on Saturday afternoon, which had been held to commemorate the founding of the National Guard. 
One drone was ""diverted"" by security forces while the second fell on its own and hit an apartment building, authorities said.
Six people have been detained, authorities said on Sunday. Intelligence agents on Monday searched an upscale hotel in eastern Caracas, workers at the hotel told Reuters, although it was not immediately evident if the searches were linked to the blasts.

1691,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 05:01PM ET</span>",Russian PM warns NATO admission of Georgia could trigger 'terrible conflict',"By Andrew Osborn
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Monday that any future NATO decision to admit Georgia to its ranks could trigger ""a terrible conflict"" and questioned why the alliance would consider such a move.
Medvedev's comments come weeks after President Vladimir Putin warned NATO against cultivating closer ties with Ukraine and Georgia, saying such a policy was irresponsible and would have unspecified consequences for the alliance.
""This (Georgia's entry to NATO) could provoke a terrible conflict. I don’t understand what they are doing this for,"" Medvedev told Russia's Kommersant newspaper in an interview.
Georgia's NATO ambitions have been a source of anger for Russia - which shares a border with ex-Soviet republic Georgia and does not want to see it join what it regards as a hostile military bloc - since 2008 when NATO leaders promised Georgia it would one day join the alliance. 
Russian forces entered two breakaway Georgian regions in 2008, which remain garrisoned by Russian troops to this day, something Moscow says is in keeping with local people's wishes, but which the West and the Georgian government call an illegal occupation.
NATO leaders discussed ties with Georgia at their summit in Brussels in July, a move Medvedev, who was president when Russian and Georgian forces clashed in 2008, condemned.
""As for the recent NATO decision reaffirming its commitment to eventually admit Georgia, what can I say to this? It is an absolutely irresponsible position and a threat to peace,"" said Medvedev. 
Prominent Georgian politicians are keen for their country to join the Western military alliance, but have seen their chances of joining hampered by Russian territorial incursions into the two breakaway territories - South Ossetia and Abkhazia. 
Russia has recognized the two regions as independent states and Medvedev said Georgia's entry into NATO therefore raised the risk of conflict with Moscow.
Asked what would happen if Georgia joined NATO without the two regions and whether there was a risk of conflict, Medvedev said:
""Yes, clearly so, because we view Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states. We understand that if any other country claims that they are part of its national territory, this may have severe consequences. Therefore, I hope that the NATO leadership will have enough sense not to take any steps in this direction.""

Under NATO rules, countries with territorial conflicts cannot join the alliance.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Security forces in Ethiopia's eastern Somali region on Monday shot dead four people protesting against the looting of their shops and homes in weekend unrest, a witness said.
Violence broke out in the provincial capital Jijiga on Saturday, with mobs looting properties owned by ethnic minorities, in unrest that the government said had been stoked by regional officials at odds with central authorities.
The attacks forced thousands to seek refuge in an Ethiopian Orthodox church from Friday, residents told Reuters. On Monday, some of them staged a protest.
""They blocked a road surrounding the church to demonstrate, before security forces arrived and began firing indiscriminately,"" one resident of the town told Reuters.
The witness, who declined to be named, said he saw four bodies on the ground after the crowd dispersed. Gunfire rang out throughout the day.
At least two Ethiopian Orthodox churches were also burned down over the weekend, other residents told Reuters. 
Amid the violence, the region's president Abdi Mohammed Omer stepped down late on Monday, state-owned media outlets said. The agencies did not offer any explanation for his resignation.
But earlier, government spokesman Ahmed Shide had said regional officials were stoking violence at a time when attempts were being made to address rights abuses in the region.
He said the officials claimed the government was illegally forcing them to resign, and that a regional paramilitary force had taken part in the attacks under their orders.
""Infrastructure was destroyed and civilians were subjected to killings and lootings. Religious centers were also attacked and banks looted,"" he said at a news conference.
""These acts were carried out by gangs of youths that were organized by some members of the region's leadership."" 
Witnesses told Reuters that soldiers were deployed as early as Friday evening. But Ahmed said orders were given only on Monday and that they would soon ""start operations"" to restore calm.
The Somali region has seen sporadic violence for three decades. The government has fought the rebel Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) since 1984 after the group launched a bid for secession of the province, also known as Ogaden. 
Since 2017, clashes along its border with Oromiya province have displaced tens of thousands of people. 
In July, the region's officials were accused by the government in Addis Ababa of perpetrating rights abuses. Last month, authorities fired senior prison officials there over allegations of torture.
The unrest in the province marks a first test for new prime minister Abiy Ahmed, who has pledged transparency and a crackdown on abuses by security services.

1693,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 03:20PM ET</span>",Jailed Bahraini opposition leader denied medical treatment: son,"By Bozorgmehr Sharafedin
LONDON (Reuters) - Bahraini opposition leader Hassan Mushaima is being denied vital medical care in jail in the Gulf state, says his son Ali Mushaima, on hunger strike outside Bahrain's London embassy.
Hassan Mushaima, 70, was arrested in 2011 along with other Shi'ite activists and opposition figures and sentenced to life in prison for leading anti-government protests that year at the height of the region's ""Arab Spring"" uprisings.
Amnesty International on Monday also accused Bahraini authorities of failing to provide proper medical care for Mushaima and three other elderly jailed activists for over a year.
""They are killing my father slowly, because when you are denying a 70-year-old man his medicine, his body will not take it,"" said Ali Mushaima, sitting on a thin mattress on the pavement in front of the Bahrain Embassy, where he began his vigil on August 1.
Mushaima said his father had been treated for cancer several years ago, and needed regular check-ups to ensure the disease had not returned.
He said his father also suffered from high blood pressure, diabetes and a urinary tract infection. His medication is running out and authorities had not supplied him with new pills, Ali said.
Bahraini officials did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The Bahraini embassy in London last week denied Mushaima was being mistreated, saying he had been to the prison medical clinic 16 times since the beginning of 2018.
The embassy said ""he continues to receive medical attention, along with his prescribed medications and a special diet as part of his medical regime.""
The embassy said Mushaima had been diagnosed with cancer 10 years ago. Since his conviction in 2012, arrangements had been made for scans every six months, it said. 
""However, Mr Mushaima refused to attend these scans on both occasions last year,"" it said on its Twitter account. 
His son told Reuters: ""They want to humiliate my father by putting handcuffs and shackles on his hands and feet, and he is saying I am not going to hospital or to see my family like this.""
SHI'ITE MAJORITY, SUNNI RULERS
Western-allied Bahrain, where the U.S. Fifth Fleet is based, crushed mass protests by the Shi'ite Muslim majority in 2011. The ruling Sunni Al Khalifa family has kept a lid on unrest since then by closing Shi'ite-led opposition groups and prosecuting activists.
Bahrain's rulers have refused to make power-sharing concessions to the Shi’ites, seen by the authorities and Sunni Arab neighbors including Saudi Arabia as proxies for non-Arab Shi’ite rival Iran.
Authorities in Bahrain have convicted scores of people of terrorism in a series of mass trials. Rights activists say they are mostly peaceful opposition activists.
""The Bahraini authorities' treatment of these wrongfully imprisoned peaceful activists violates international law and standards on prisoner treatment and constitutes cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment,"" said Lynn Maalouf, Middle East Research Director at Amnesty International.
Demonstrators have clashed frequently with security forces, who have been targeted by bomb attacks. Bahrain has accused the opposition of undermining security and blamed the bombings on Iran and Lebanon's armed Shi'ite group Hezbollah. Iran and Hezbollah deny any involvement in Bahrain's unrest. 
Ali Mushaima has been in London since 2006. He said he had been sentenced by Bahrain courts in absentia to 45 years in jail and his citizenship had been revoked.
He told Reuters that he began his hunger strike last week to raise awareness of his father's plight. 
""I have lost five kilos. I am drinking, but I am not eating. My demand is very simple ... I am talking about medical care, family visits and access to books.""
He criticized the U.S. and British governments for not pressuring Bahrain over the crackdown, saying the British government was ""indirectly"" responsible since it ""trained the Bahraini police officers and provided technical assistance"".
A spokesperson for Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office told Reuters on Monday: “We believe that only by working with Bahrain can we hope to bring about the changes we would like to see.” 
Britain opened a permanent military base in Bahrain in April in an attempt to boost its role as a major player in the region.

The newspaper said prosecutors had completed the extradition request and it was ready for submission. The Russian embassy in Britain said it had not received an official request from London.
Sergei Skripal, a former colonel in Russian military intelligence who betrayed dozens of agents to Britain’s MI6 foreign spy service, and his daughter Yulia, were found unconscious on a public bench in Salisbury in early March.
Britain blamed Russia for the poisonings and identified the poison as Novichok, a deadly group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet military in the 1970s and 1980s. Russia has repeatedly denied any involvement in the attack.
Any extradition request is likely to be rejected by Russia - and risks inflaming diplomatic tensions between London and Moscow, which are the worst since the Cold War.
The Russian constitution forbids the extradition of Russian citizens to another state. Russian officials refused to hand over the men wanted for the murder of Alexander Litvinenko with a rare radioactive isotope in 2006.
An investigation by hundreds of British police and intelligence officers have pieced together the movements of the two Russians, from their entry into Britain through to their departure, the Guardian reported.
Britain's interior ministry and the Crown Prosecution Service declined to comment.
After the attack on the Skripals, allies in Europe and the United States sided with Britain's view of the attack and ordered the biggest expulsion of Russian diplomats since the height of the Cold War.
Russia retaliated by expelling Western diplomats. Moscow has repeatedly denied any involvement and accused the British intelligence agencies of staging the attack to stoke anti-Russian hysteria.
Since then, a British woman, Dawn Sturgess, died last month after coming across a small bottle containing Novichok near Salisbury where the Skripals were struck down. Her partner, Charlie Rowley, was also stricken.
The motive for attacking Skripal, then aged 66 who was exchanged in a Kremlin-approved spy swap in 2010, is still unclear, as is the motive for using an exotic nerve agent which has such clear links to Russia's Soviet past.

The decision to press for extradition follows a debate within the government, divided between those who want to ratchet up the response to Russia and those who see the request as a futile political gesture, the Guardian reported.

An indictment was filed against 10 hospital employees for receiving gifts related to the purchase of medical equipment and medicine.
Two of the 10 were charged with money laundering and one with forging or destroying business documents to conceal evidence, the state news agency STA reported. 
Three more people were accused of giving bribes and a further two others for money laundering, the STA said.
The prosecutors said their investigation since 2013 in five cities in Slovenia, including the capital Ljubljana, has revealed that suppliers of medical equipment had offered bribes to doctors and other hospital officials to favor them.
The prosecutor's office said that these criminal acts had caused 1.18 million euros ($1.36 million) losses to public funds, STA reported.
The state of the national health system was a big campaign issue ahead of an election in June because of long waiting-lists for medical examinations and operations and a shortage of money and staff.

At least two people were killed and more than 60 injured, according to local authorities.
Police closed off the road where the crash took place as well as the surrounding area of Borgo Panigale, on the outskirts of the city of Bologna.
Video of the incident showed the tanker truck, which contained inflammable materials, slamming into the back of a lorry which had come to a halt because of heavy traffic.
The tanker immediately caught fire and then exploded, causing part of a road bridge to collapse. The fire spread to a car dealership below and several other vehicles burst into flames.
""The shockwave from the blast was extremely violent. Many of the injured received cuts from flying glass, which had shattered,"" said Giovanni Carella, the emergency coordinator for the local fire service. 
He said he thought the tanker had probably been carrying liquid petroleum gas. 
A video shot from a parked car appeared to show someone being engulfed by flames when the tanker exploded.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday ruled that the Trump administration must fully restore a program that protects from deportation some young immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children, including accepting new applications for the program. 
U.S. District Judge John Bates in Washington, D.C., said he would stay Friday's order, however, until August 23 to give the administration time to decide whether to appeal. 
Bates first issued a ruling in April ordering the federal government to continue the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, including taking applications. He stayed that ruling for 90 days to give the government time to better explain why the program should be ended. 
On Friday Bates, who was appointed by former President George W. Bush, a Republican, said he would not revise his previous ruling because the arguments of President Donald Trump's administration did not override his concerns.
Under DACA, roughly 700,000 young adults, often referred to as ""Dreamers"", were protected from deportation and given work permits for two-year periods, after which they must re-apply to the program. 
The program was created in 2012 under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat. 
Two other federal courts in California and New York had previously ordered that DACA remain in place while litigation challenging Trump's decision to end it continued. Those rulings only required the government to process DACA renewals, not new applications. 
Another lawsuit in a Texas federal court is seeking to end DACA.
A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Justice said on Friday that the government would continue to defend its position that it ""acted within its lawful authority in deciding to wind down DACA in an orderly manner.""
Congress so far has failed to pass legislation to address the fate of the Dreamers, including a potential path to citizenship.

Friday's ruling came in lawsuits filed by several groups and institutions, including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and Princeton University.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's Foreign Correspondents' Club resisted pressure from Chinese officials to cancel an event with an independence activist, provoking rebuke from the pro-Beijing establishment as it seeks to curb talks about independence in the city.
The club invited activist Andy Chan to speak at a luncheon next Tuesday, which drew strong criticism from China's Foreign Ministry in the former British colony as well as current and former leaders.
A number of Reuters journalists are members of the FCC. 
The FCC's acting president, Victor Mallet, said China's Foreign Ministry had made ""representations to the club"" regarding the event, without elaborating on what the ministry had said. The club was pressing ahead with the luncheon, he said. 
""We believe that in free societies such as Hong Kong it is vitally important to allow people to speak and debate freely, even if one does not agree with their particular views,"" the FCC said in a statement on Monday. 
A former British colony, Hong Kong has come under Chinese rule since 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" agreement that promises it a high degree of autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed in China, including free speech and a free press.
While China's Foreign Ministry has an office in Hong Kong, its duty is limited to matters related to foreign affairs.
""We are firmly against the attempt of any external forces to provide a venue to the advocates for 'Hong Kong independence' to spread their nonsense,"" a spokesperson from the office said in a statement on Sunday.
""With their open advocacy and engagement in separatist activities, the 'Hong Kong independence' forces have crossed the bottom line of 'one country, two systems',"" it added.
Chan has grabbed headlines in recent weeks after the government moved to ban his political party which advocates for the city's secession from China, something Beijing deems an illegal challenge to its Communist Party rulers.
Chan, who is not charged of any crime and whose group has not yet been banned, said he appreciated the club's move to stand by its decision. 
""The Chinese government thinks Hong Kong is like mainland China, where you can ban foreign media and impose an information blackout,"" Chan said.
""It is hard for local Hong Kong groups to stand firm like the FCC. The overall situation is very bad."" 
The International Federation of Journalists condemned the Chinese government's move, saying it is ""a blatant attempt to stifle free speech in Hong Kong.""
The Foreign Correspondents' Club regularly hosts luncheons at its premises, a refurbished 19th century ice house, where it invites a range of speakers, from officials from the Chinese Foreign Ministry to Tibet campaigners.

YANGON (Reuters) - A Myanmar court heard defense witnesses on Monday vouch for the integrity of two Reuters journalists accused of obtaining secret state documents and will hear final arguments in two weeks, when the trial regarded as a test of press freedom resumes.
Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, and Wa Lone, 32, are facing up to 14 years in prison for allegedly violating Myanmar's colonial-era Official Secrets Act. Both have pleaded not guilty to the charges and have told the court how they were ""trapped"" by police officials who planted documents on them.
For latest updates on jailed Reuters journalists: https://reut.rs/2FuHigK
During Monday's session, their former teacher Ye Naing Moe, director of Yangon Journalism School, praised both reporters as curious and excellent students who had won multiple awards for stories focusing on the underprivileged and social issues.
""We haven't seen any stories they wrote which have violated media ethics,"" he said, explaining that the school monitored the work of its former students.
""I believe that Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo performed the most important role of journalists which is revealing the truth,” said Ye Naing Moe. ""Finding defects, problems and revealing them in a positive way gives a chance to fix things and that benefits the society and the country.” 
A second witness, Thant Zin Soe, had worked with Wa Lone at a charity distributing humanitarian aid to the victims of natural disasters and described him as being consistently ethical, and ""disgusted by corruption"".
At the time of their arrest in December, the journalists had been investigating the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslims in Inn Din village in western Myanmar’s Rakhine state.
The killings took place during an army crackdown that United Nations agencies say sent some 700,000 people fleeing to Bangladesh.
Prosecutor Moe Thu Aung's questioned the witnesses over whether they could have known what the intentions of the defendants were while they were reporting and whether they believed the journalists would behave unethically.
He declined to comment after the proceedings.
The trial has captured global attention and has come to be seen as a test of press freedom and reforms in the fledgling democracy, where the military still wields considerable influence.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for the immediate release of the reporters on Saturday. UN Human Rights chief, Zeid Raad Al Hussein, has also recently called for the case to be dropped ""immediately"".
Government spokesman, Zaw Htay, told Reuters by phone that Myanmar's courts are independent and the case would be conducted according to the law. He said ""they will have the full protection of their rights as citizens.""

Judge Ye Lwin adjourned the court and scheduled final arguments from both the prosecution and defense to be heard in two weeks. The judge will declare a verdict in the weeks following the final arguments, according to legal experts.
On Monday, Kyaw Soe Oo's wife and daughter and Wa Lone's pregnant wife, who is just four days away from her delivery date, sat in a courtroom packed with diplomats. 
""The day of decision will arrive soon. We believe that it will proceed in a fair and just way,"" said Wa Lone, before he was taken back to jail.
Kyaw Soe Oo and Wa Lone have testified that Police Lance Corporal Naing Lin and another officer handed them documents during their meeting at a north Yangon restaurant, but that they had no time to look at them before being arrested as they left.
A police captain, Moe Yan Naing, has also testified that a superior officer had instructed his subordinates, including Naing Lin, to “trap” the reporters. Naing Lin has told the court he met the reporters, but denied giving them anything.
Other police witnesses have previously told the court the reporters were arrested at a random security checkpoint, by officers who were unaware they were journalists, and found to be holding secret documents in their hands.
