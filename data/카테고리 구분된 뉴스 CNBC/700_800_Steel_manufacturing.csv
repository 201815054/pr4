In 1990, a similar lava flow engulfed the nearby town of Kalapana, destroying nearly 200 homes and covering the roads leading to them.', 'Today, some residents of the area have scratched bumpy tracks across the lava flow to reach their homes but most never rebuilt. Instead, it’s become a tourist destination where visitors can hike out to watch small lava outbreaks ooze across older flows.', 'In Leilani Estates, few of the homes are elaborate, although all are beloved. Most are single-story structures fitted with solar panels and rain-catchment systems since there’s no municipal water supply in the area.', 'Tiny homes are popular, especially because clearing larger lots is such a backbreaking process: Aside from having to gouge out holes for septic systems, homeowners must constantly battle back the jungle that closes in, fire ants in tow.', '“I think they know and understand ... that Madame Pele decides who will be impacted,” Gov. David Ige said, referring to the Hawaiian volcano goddess. “Obviously it’s very different when you actually have it happen.”', 'Longtime area resident Jeno Enocencio, 67, said people who live in the area choose to take that risk. Many do because land is so cheap. A small lot can be purchased for just $8,000 if you’re willing to put in the effort to clear it and understand the risk that comes with living on the side of an active volcano.', 'Because the community sits in a zone deemed by the U.S. Geological Survey to have a high risk of lava, few insurance companies will issues policies there. And those policies that are available cost thousands of dollars a year, a hefty cost many residents simply forgo. According to the Census Bureau, the median family income in Pahoa is about $30,000 annually.', '“They knew what they were getting into,” Enocencio said, adding at one point he had 15 evacuees staying at his home.', 'That’s little consolation to the people who have lost their homes.

3,People are wildly underestimating Trump’s destructive impact on the environment,2016-11-14T16:38:06+0000,"['  Unified Republican control of the federal government over the  next two years augurs a sea change in US environmental policy  like nothing since the late 1960s and ’70s, when America’s  landmark environmental laws were first passed.', '  If Donald Trump and the GOP actually follow through on what  they’ve promised, this time around will be a lurch in the  opposite direction. Federal climate policy will all but  disappear; participation in international environmental or  climate treaties will end; pollution regulations will be  reversed, frozen in place, or not enforced; clean energy  research, development, and deployment assistance will decline;  protections for sensitive areas and ecosystems will be lifted;  federal leasing of fossil fuels will expand and accelerate; new  Supreme Court appointees will crack down on EPA discretion.', '  Some of these moves will be easy for Trump and Republicans in  Congress to pull off. Others will be harder: Senate Democrats and  environmental groups in court will fight them tooth and nail, as  they did during the Reagan and Bush years. But there’s no  escaping the fact that the GOP is in a strong position to  demolish and reshape the regime of environmental protection that  has been built up over the past 50 years.', ' More from Vox:Donald Trump’s presidency will be like Donald  Trump’s campaign Facebook is starting to take responsibility for fake  news. It could do more. Trump can end Obamacare’s free birth  control — and he doesn’t need Congress’s  help', '  Never mind Trump — the GOP Congress has a radical  environmental agenda ready to go', '  Donald Trump’s promise to dismantle President Obama’s climate  regulations have gotten plenty of attention. But it is only the  tip of the iceberg, a fraction of what many Republicans in  Congress have been pushing for over the years.', '  Obama has amassed a considerable record on green policy. His  agencies have implemented a range of new standards and  regulations on everything from appliances to cars to power  plants, and he has stimulated the growth of several clean energy  industries with loans and grants.', '  The GOP wants to undo all that. But it wants much more as well.', '  Few people understand just how radical the GOP environmental  agenda is, but it’s not a secret. While Obama has been in office,  Republicans in Congress have floated myriad budget bills that  reveal their legislative priorities. Many of those bills were  blocked by the Senate or White House, so they rarely got  attention.', '  You can see a partial list of past House Republican bills here.  In 2013, they proposed cutting EPA funding by fully 34 percent.  GOP committees churned out bill after bill to cut research  funding for renewable energy by 50 percent, block rules on coal  pollution, block rules on oil spills, block rules on pesticide  spraying, accelerate oil and gas drilling permits on public land,  prohibit funding for creation or expansion of wildlife refuges,  cut funding for the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing  Loan Program, and ... well, there are 61 items on the list.', '  The Senate GOP isn’t far behind: In 2015, they floated a bill to  cut the EPA’s budget by 9 percent and block rules on everything  from ground-level ozone pollution to fracking to climate change.  There may be a few more moderate GOP senators who think global  warming is a problem, like Susan Collins (R-ME). But they do not  dominate the caucus: Fossil-fuel enthusiasts like Mitch McConnell  and Jim Inhofe do.', '  There’s no indication that Trump will buck his party on these  issues. His ignorance on policy is near total and he’s shown no  desire or willingness to learn anything about it. So in practice,  environmental policy under Trump is likely to be run by the GOP  apparatus — Republican leaders in Congress and the  industry-friendly figures he appoints to his administration. He’s  already tapped climate denier Myron Ebell to lead the transition  at EPA and is considering Sarah Palin (yes, really) to head the  Department of the Interior.', '  There’s little reason to think that Trump’s environmental and  climate policy will be some unpredictable, idiosyncratic anomaly  like Trump himself. It will likely be standard, mainstream GOP  policy, which is far more radical than anything he campaigned on.', '  The biggest thing slowing the GOP right now is the Senate  filibuster', '  It won’t be easy for the Trump administration to roll back many  of the EPA’s existing regulations on its own. As Jody Freeman, an  Obama administration veteran, explains here, rewriting existing  regulations through the executive branch is an arduous process,  one that’s almost certain to get bogged down in court by green  groups skilled at litigation. Similar lawsuits ultimately stymied  George W. Bush in the 2000s.', '  So the biggest question is whether Republicans in Congress can  revamp the laws that underpin and guide the EPA. And here, the  only thing stopping them is the Senate.', '  There will be 47 Democrats in the Senate in 2017. If 40 of them  can stick together, they can filibuster Republican environmental  legislation. (Ending a filibuster requires a cloture vote by a  supermajority of 60 senators.)', '  Will Republican leaders let that happen? Or will they get rid of  the filibuster? They would need only 50 votes to do so. Jonathan  Chait thinks the filibuster is toast. Jonathan Bernstein thinks  there’s a chance it could survive, since there are some  old-school institutionalists on the right, like Jeff Flake and  John McCain, who prefer to keep it.', '  If the filibuster survives, Republicans will be significantly  constrained in what they can do, though they still have options.  They could, for instance, try to slip environmental measures that  affect the federal budget into budget reconciliation bills —  those only need 51 votes to pass. (Paul Ryan suggested that  strategy in a presser in January.)', '  Here are 11 top environmental priorities for Trump and a GOP  Congress', '  1) Kill Obama’s Clean Power Plan', '  The GOP is nearly united in its hatred of Obama’s signature  climate policy, the Clean Power Plan. There’s only one Republican  senator left, Susan Collins of Maine, who has ever defended it.  Killing or degrading the CPP will be a top priority.', '  In 2007′s Massachusetts v. EPA, the Supreme Court ruled that  greenhouse gases could, if judged dangerous to human health or  welfare, be considered pollutants subject to the Clean Air Act.  Shortly thereafter, EPA’s scientists judged them dangerous to  both.', '  That means EPA must, by law, act to reduce greenhouse gases. The  Obama administration followed through on this by enacting fuel  economy standards for cars and light trucks (see below). It also  set up the Clean Power Plan, which would reduce carbon dioxide  emissions from existing power plants.', '  The simplest way for the GOP to destroy the CPP would be to take  away the EPA’s ability to regulate greenhouse gases at all. It’s  a simple bill: “The Clean Air Act shall not apply to greenhouse  gases.” The CPP would be nuked, and no president could ever again  try to do what Obama did. (The House passed just such a bill in  2011.)', '  If Senate Democrats can filibuster this measure — and this  is likely to be a central fight — then the Trump  administration would have to resort to other executive branch  strategies to weaken the rule. It could refuse to defend it in  court. It could deny EPA the funds necessary to enforce it. It  could start another round of rulemaking to substantially weaken  it. That would inevitably prompt lawsuits, but those lawsuits  would drag on for years and years.', '  One way or another, the CPP is in the crosshairs.', '  2) Withdraw from the Paris climate agreement', 'Back in 2015, the world’s countries got together in Paris and  agreed to a landmark climate deal. Every country would  voluntarily pledge to restrain its greenhouse gas emissions and  meet regularly at the United Nations to ratchet up ambitions over  time — all in the hopes of keeping global warming below the  “dangerous” level of 2°C.', 'Now Trump plans to pull the United States out of the deal. His  advisers are debating exactly how to do this, but there’s little  stopping them. Trump can refuse to follow through on Obama’s  pledge of cutting emissions 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.  He can refuse to attend UN meetings, or refuse to chip in  promised funds to help poor countries decarbonize.', 'The real question is how other countries react. For now, the  Chinese government is warning Trump not to blow up the deal and  insisting that China will lead global efforts to curtail  emissions in America’s absence. Still, there’s a real risk that  other countries could lose interest in climate policy if the  world’s wealthiest superpower bows out.', 'Even under Paris, the world was struggling to stay below the  2°C global warming mark and had little margin for error. Now,  with Trump’s recalcitrance, that goal has likely drifted out of  reach.', '3) Dismantle US environmental rules around coal power', 'Coal has always been the dirtiest, most carbon-intensive of  fuels. Over the past eight years, Obama’s EPA has slowly  ratcheted up environmental restrictions on air and water  pollution from coal plants and mining activities.', 'Trump plans to ratchet them back down. Here’s his website: “We  will end the war on coal, and rescind the coal mining lease  moratorium ... and conduct a top-down review of all anti-coal  regulations issued by the Obama Administration.”', 'Trump’s vow to “end the war on coal” will start by killing the  Clean Power Plan. But his administration has also vowed to scale  back an EPA rule to limit ground-level ozone pollution, as well  as an Interior Department rule to protect streams from  coal-mining waste. As Freeman explains, it won’t be easy for  Trump to rescind regulations that are already finalized, but he  can certainly bog down implementation.', 'As for coal mining: About 40 percent of US coal supply comes from  public land. For years, the federal government has leased that  land to coal companies for below market value, with almost no  competitive bidding. It amounts to a huge subsidy to coal  companies. In January, the Obama administration implemented an  immediate moratorium on new coal leases, as the program was  examined to make sure it was fair to taxpayers and ecologically  sensitive. Trump would end that moratorium.', 'The consultancy group Wood Mackenzie has a long list of other  ideas Trump might pursue to aid the coal industry. Note that many  of these steps would have limited impact: Coal plants have  already made costly investments to curb mercury pollution, so  scaling back that Obama rule wouldn’t do much. And Trump won’t  save the coal industry from its biggest threat: the flood of  cheap shale gas from fracking. There’s also little chance that  mining jobs will make a major comeback, since automation has been  the biggest driver of job losses there.', 'Coal production, consumption, and employment are all headed down,  and likely to keep heading down regardless of what Trump does.', 'Still, Trump’s moves will, at the margins, make the coal industry  more profitable. Note that Peabody Coal, the world’s largest coal  company, saw its share price soar after Trump’s election.', 'TWEET', '  4) Weaken fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks', 'The Clean Power Plan isn’t Obama’s only big climate policy. Ever  since 2010, the Obama administration has been ratcheting up fuel  economy standards for new cars and light trucks in an effort to  cut carbon emissions and reduce US oil dependence. These CAFE  standards are set to rise from their current 35 miles per gallon  to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025.', 'But those numbers aren’t set in stone. The CAFE rules come up for  a scheduled review in 2018. Automakers are now lobbying for Trump  to relax the standards, purportedly because sales of  fuel-efficient vehicles have been sluggish due to low gasoline  prices. While Trump hasn’t commented on this, he has plenty of  leeway to weaken these rules.', 'The one twist here is that due to a longstanding quirk of the  Clean Air Act, California can threaten to create its own stricter  vehicle standards if it’s not happy with what the federal  government is doing (and other states can join in). Automakers  loathe the idea of multiple sets of vehicle standards around the  country, which may prevent Trump from weakening the rules too  much.', 'Meanwhile, some Republicans in Congress have been talking about  getting rid of fuel economy standards altogether — through  legislation. “You can make a good intellectual case to repeal  CAFE and let the market handle it,” said Rep. Joe Barton (R-TX)  at a House Energy Committee hearing in September. “If Mr. Trump  is president … we’ll be back.”', '5) Open up new public lands to oil and gas drilling', 'America has about 279 million acres of public land and waters  with potential oil and gas. The government allows companies to  drill on a little under half that acreage. But both Congress and  the Obama administration have put the rest off limits over the  years, often to protect fragile ecosystems or endangered species.', 'Trump has promised to open it all up. He often touts a study  looking at the impact of allowing drilling on all federal lands  currently off limits. Some of that Trump could do through  executive actions, like lifting the Obama-era restrictions around  oil drilling in Alaska or the Arctic Ocean or even parts of the  Atlantic Coast. Opening up other regions, like the Arctic  National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, would require Congress.', 'Even if Trump does this, it’s still unclear how much drilling  would actually occur. Oil prices are fairly low right now, which  could make it risky for companies to drill in the most  challenging areas, like Alaska’s Arctic seas (where Shell tried  and failed to find oil). And a few states, like Florida, might  put up a fight along their coasts.', 'It also doesn’t sound like Trump is going to be particularly  finicky about oil spill protections, given that he’s pledged to  “streamline the permitting process for all energy projects.” In  case you’re curious, this is a good look at what an ecological  nightmare an oil spill in the frozen Arctic would be.', '6) Scale back federal support for wind and solar power', 'Greens like to tell themselves that renewable energy is already  cheap enough to stand on its own, without policy supports, but  for a variety of reasons, that isn’t really true. Wind and solar  in the US have long relied on federal tax credits — the  investment tax credit (ITC) for solar and the production tax  credit (PTC) for wind.', '  Both credits were widely expected to lapse last year, but in a  somewhat miraculous last-minute deal in December, they were  extended for five years, over which time they will slowly phase  out.', '  This would have served as a kind of bridge for renewables,  carrying them to the point when the Clean Power Plan kicks in.  Now the CPP is likely toast. And the big question is whether  Republicans in Congress might scale back the solar and wind  credits.', '  There’s some reason to think they are safe for now. In Politico,  an unnamed “major Trump financial contributor who said he is a  member of the transition team” assures us that the ITC and PTC  “will remain in place.” Then again, oil baron Harold Hamm, a key  Trump energy adviser and rumored contender for energy secretary,  recently said of solar and wind, “None of it should be  subsidized, none of it. If it makes it in the market, fine.” So  who knows?', '  Meanwhile, Trump has also talked about zeroing out all federal  research and development for clean energy, which would include  work the Department of Energy is doing on solar, wind, nuclear  power, efficiency, electric cars, batteries, and more, including  the cutting-edge research being done at ARPA-E.', '  In the past, House Republicans have shown an eagerness to scale  back this research (though not, oddly enough, R&D for fossil  fuels). A move like this could throttle the next generation of  low-carbon technology.', ' 7) Dramatically limit the EPA’s ability to regulate in the  future', '  Most of the environmental policy progress in the US over the last  40 years has come through “green drift,” i.e., through agencies  like the EPA adapting and expanding America’s foundational green  laws — the Clean Air and Clean Water acts, the Endangered  Species Act, the National Environmental Policy Act — to  address new problems.', '  This occurs because those laws were written to be incredibly  open-ended. They were designed to be flexible, to apply to  whatever new threats agency scientists uncovered. The Clean Air  Act tells the EPA to update its rules over time to reflect the  best available science about the health impacts of pollution; the  EPA does just that.', '  This process has always driven conservatives crazy. In part, they  think the flexibility encourages executive overreach; in part,  they just hate environmental regulations.', '  They have a way to put a stop to green drift. It’s called the  REINS Act (Regulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny).  It would mandate that every “economically significant” federal  regulation — any rule that has an annual impact of $100  million or more — be affirmatively approved by the House and  Senate and be signed by the president. If a regulation is not  voted on within 70 legislative working days of being sent to  Congress, it is “tabled.” That is, it dies.', '  This law would radically constrain EPA’s ability to issue new  environmental regulations as situations and science evolved (to  say nothing of what it would do to other federal agencies). It  would be a fundamental change in the administrative state and a  radical increase in Congress’s power relative to the  president.', '  It would slow progress on all fronts, but on environmental  policy, where there is such unified Republican antipathy, it  would almost certainly result in a total freeze — no new  substantial regulations as long as Republicans control any of the  three branches of government.', '  The GOP House passed REINS several times during the Obama years,  only to see it stripped out or blocked in the Senate. With a GOP  Senate and Trump as president, there’s a very real chance it  could become law.', ' 8) Reverse the White House’s climate guidance to federal  agencies', '  In August, the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ)  issued a somewhat obscure but extremely important guidance to  other federal agencies. All agencies, when considering any new  project, have to do a National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)  review to assess the project’s environmental impacts. CEQ’s  guidance instructs agencies to consider direct and indirect  climate impacts as part of those NEPA reviews.', '  And it clarifies that agencies should not ignore climate impacts  merely because a single project might be a small fraction of  global emissions — a position many agencies had been taking.  The guidance says, effectively, that climate should matter in  every federal decision. (More on the details of the guidance  here.)', '  It has its inconsistencies, and did not carry the force of law,  but the guidance was an important signal, the kind of background  nudge that shifts the direction of the ship of state.', '  Trump has not specifically said he will rescind the guidance, but  if he puts a clever industry lobbyist in charge of CEQ, it’s  tough to see how it will survive. If it is rescinded, federal  agencies are likely to go back to ignoring climate impacts.', ' 9) Make the Supreme Court more hostile to environmental  regulation', '  Conservatives, states, and businesses have sued against virtually  every environmental regulation in the past 40 years. Very often,  those suits have failed. Since the Supreme Court’s Chevron  decision in 1984 (ironically written by Antonin Scalia, though he  turned on the doctrine in later years), the Court has given  executive branch agencies wide latitude in how they write and  implement rules to carry out congressional intent.', '  The conservatives on the Court have been seeking to rein in  executive agencies lately, especially after Obama, who built a  progressive policy legacy almost entirely out of executive  actions.', '  Trump will get to select at least one, and possibly up to four,  Supreme Court justices, who are likely to be to Scalia’s right.  For every justice he picks, the Court as a whole is likely to  become more hostile to executive action, meaning that lawsuits  against environmental regulations are likely to find a much more  amenable venue in coming years.', ' 10) Pack the executive branch with industry-friendly  appointments', '  One thing that’s become very clear over the past few decades:  When it comes to the federal government, personnel is policy. The  people who staff and head executive branch agencies make a stream  of daily decisions, the vast majority of which never rise to the  level of public attention. Those agency decisions pile up over  time. They can lead to steady, effective government or to  incompetence and corruption.', '  George W. Bush legendarily stocked his government with industry  executives, lobbyists, and cronies. Under his Interior  Department, officials used to trade favors to the oil and gas  industry for hookers and blow. (No, seriously.) Reports on the  agency submitted to Congress “portray a dysfunctional  organization that has been riddled with conflicts of interest,  unprofessional behavior and a free-for-all atmosphere for much of  the Bush administration’s watch.”', '  Under Bush’s EPA, meanwhile, administrator Stephen Johnson  “suppress[ed] staff recommendations on pesticides, mercury, lead  paint, smog, and global warming.” In Bush’s White House Council  on Environmental Quality, James Connaughton denied global warming  and defended the air quality in Lower Manhattan just after 9/11.  Philip Cooney, also at CEQ, was busted doctoring scientific  reports on climate change and left the administration to lobby  for Exxon. FEMA had Michael Brown. The list could go on.', '  The kind of crude collusion between industry and government that  characterized the Bush administration looks, from all  indications, to be Trump’s model.', '  His pick to lead his EPA transition is Myron Ebell of the  Competitive Enterprise Institute, mostly famous for his sheer  persistence in denying climate change (he’s been at it since  2000). He recently said that “Congress should prohibit any  funding for the Paris Climate Treaty, the Green Climate Fund, and  the underlying UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.”', '  There are several more industry lobbyists on Trump’s energy and  environment team; see Robin Bravender at ClimateWire for more.', ' 11) A flurry of anti-EPA budget bills that will emerge every  year, without end', '  The above list is by no means exhaustive. Trump has also  indicated that he would like to repeal the EPA’s Waters of the  United States rule, which would limit the number of rivers,  streams, and lakes that fall under the Clean Water Act. The oil  and gas industry is already eager to kill Obama-era rules to plug  leaks of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from pipelines and  wells. Trump could do both of those through executive  action.', '  Then there’s Congress. Various Republicans in the House have a  whole flurry of anti-EPA bills they’re eager to push forward, and  they will try to attach these “riders” to must-pass budget and  spending bills at every turn.', '  In 2015, there were riders to prevent the federal government from  updating its flood-map plans to incorporate climate change  forecasts. Riders to block the EPA from even researching the  environmental impacts of fracking. Riders to halt upgrades to  wastewater management systems. Riders to block the Department of  Energy’s efforts to improve climate change modeling and  forecasts. Riders to hinder citizens from suing the federal  government if it falls down on the job of enforcing the Clean  Water Act. You can check out the full smorgasbord here.', '  Resistance will be fierce, but it lacks leverage', '  Climate and environmental groups will not simply sit back and  watch this happen. “If Donald Trump thinks he can launch a big  polluter assault on our air, waters, wildlife and lands,” said  Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, in  a statement, “we’ll build a wall of opposition to stop him.”', '  In politics, every action has an equal and opposite reaction. An  assault on environmental laws and regulations will spark fierce,  organized resistance, just as it did during the Bush years. Many  of the internal squabbles within the climate community —  carbon tax or cap and trade? research or deployment? — will  rapidly come to seem quaint. The stakes will be higher, the sides  clearer.', '  But there’s no getting around it: The victories will be fewer.  Even during the Bush years, the environmental community had more  to work with, including an occasionally Democratic Senate and a  few old-fashioned Republicans who cared about local pollution.  (Oh, and the filibuster.)', '  Now it has none of those. The GOP controls the House, the Senate,  the presidency, the Supreme Court, and, soon enough, lower  courts. If Republicans kill the filibuster, they will be  virtually unrestrained at the federal level, limited only by  their ability to overcome infighting and internal disagreement  (which, admittedly, is no small thing). The 2018 Senate map is  incredibly favorable to Republicans, and right now they look  poised to strengthen their majority in the midterms.', '  The GOP also dominates at the state level, controlling 68 out of  99 state legislative chambers (both chambers in 33 states) and 32  governors’ mansions.', '  What’s more, the GOP has become much more radicalized since the  Bush years, and the country much more partisan. “Negative  partisanship” — hatred of the other side — is  increasingly the prime motive force in US politics, with less and  less willingness on either side to compromise or even negotiate.  There is virtually no Republican support left for environmental  or climate policy, other than to dismantle it.', '  While there is always some chance Trump could lunge off in an  unexpected direction (he is Trump, after all), the overwhelming  likelihood is that GOP operatives and industry lobbyists will  control energy and environmental policy for the next four years.  What lies ahead now is triage, a long string of terrible choices,  desperate battles, and wrenching losses, the consequences of  which could reverberate for millennia.', ' Commentary by Vox writer Brad Plumer.

4,South Africa: How Cape Town beat the drought,2018-05-03T18:37:25+0000,"['It doesn’t look much like victory — the scorched rocks, bone-dry corpses of long-dead trees and the hot white sand stretching into the distance speak more of a scene of desolation.', 'This is no desert. It is a dam, set in the middle of fruit orchards and golf courses in South Africa’s Western Cape province. Theewaterskloof, the biggest reservoir for Cape Town, is a diminished trickle after three years of relentless drought that have reduced it to barely a tenth of its 480bn-litre capacity. It is now possible to stroll through ghostly rows of Chenin Blanc vines submerged when the dam was flooded, in the 1970s.', 'It is a biblical scene. “If the world ends tomorrow and the Lord brings the fire, there won’t be the water to extinguish it,” says Rachel Erasmus, a resident of Villiersdorp, a nearby town.', 'Theewaterskloof shows the severity of the water crisis that threatened to turn South Africa’s second city, 120km away and with a population of nearly 4m, almost completely dry this year. In the words of Cyril Ramaphosa, speaking in January before he became South Africa’s president, Cape Town faced “real, total disaster”. In an age of climate change it was the world’s first metropolis to confront such a fate.', 'And yet, remarkably, Cape Town has averted it — for now at least. Day Zero, the disaster movie-like moment when municipal engineers would have turned off the taps for millions and forced them to queue at military-guarded standpipes, has been pushed back to 2019.', 'City planners had been braced as recently as February for Day Zero to arrive by April after annual rainfall dropped from an average of 1,100mm in 2013 to just 500mm last year, devastating a provincial supply system reliant, almost entirely, on the collection of surface water. Many pray enough rain will come in the next few winter months to exorcise the drought altogether.', 'However, respite has come not from the skies, nor the ground nor ocean through technological tricks to tap subterranean aquifers and desalinate seawater. It is largely down to one of the most drastic civic water conservation campaigns ever conceived.', 'In three years, Cape Town residents have more than halved their use from 1.2bn litres a day in 2015, to just over 500m litres at the start of this year — a record-breaking pace. “We’re going to become one of the world’s water-resilient cities,” says Helen Zille, the Western Cape’s provincial premier and a former mayor of Cape Town.', 'It has included enforcing suburban restrictions of 50 litres a day per person, versus a global average use of 185 litres, with key sectors such as tourism and agriculture bearing the brunt of scarcity. Authorities combined behavioural nudges and public praise with draconian surveillance and dire warnings.', '“Water use has dropped quite amazingly,” says Neil Armitage, a professor of civil water engineering at the University of Cape Town. “We will definitely make this year. If we have another dry year as bad as the last, it looks as though we could survive it again. People didn’t like being treated like naughty children. But it worked.”', 'It has been a close-run thing. Day Zero, under which residents would have been rationed to 25 litres a day, would have been triggered when overall dam levels fell to 13.5 per cent. They are currently at 19 per cent. Facing a future that is more urban, more unequal and straining at ecological limits, cities in the developing world may look to Cape Town for lessons.', 'If they do, they will find a parable — about a young democracy facing tough decisions over sharing scant resources, while addressing injustices from its past and institutional failings in its present.', 'Democracy is on Adilson Ndala’s mind as the 27-year-old salesman waits in a queue at the Newlands spring at the foot of Table Mountain, where many have come during the crisis to fill plastic containers to top up official daily restrictions. “We’ve got black, white, Indian, coloured, lining up for water — just like we all lined up to vote in 1994,” when South Africa’s first post-apartheid poll took place, Mr Ndala says.', 'It is a powerful image of solidarity. The authorities have not been shy about reinforcing the message as they have kept the public informed of dam levels and water usage. A colour-coded map shows adherence to water restrictions street by street online — dark green for the virtuous, lighter shades for those under pressure to catch up. Escalating tariffs on the rich are meant to pay for basic water for the poor.', 'But in one of the world’s most unequal cities, where apartheid’s legacy separates mostly rich and white suburbs from largely poor and black shantytowns, the efforts to avoid Day Zero have involved cajoling a divided society into thinking of water as a common problem. When mostly white middle-class people bring up urban myths about waste in townships, “I give it [the truth] to them,” Ms Zille says. “People get it. They’re prepared to adapt\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009we’ve got to change our water culture.”', 'For those in the suburbs, keeping within 50 litres has involved juggling showers of 60 seconds with judicious flushes of the toilet and careful management of laundry. Cars have been left to collect a patina of dirt and lawns have turned brown. But for many in the townships and informal shack settlements that house just under a quarter of Cape Town’s population, such conditions would be seen as a luxury.', 'In fact Day Zero would never have come to townships like Philippi. The average use per person is already close to or below the 25 litres that it would have enforced. “Tongue in cheek, I often say the rest of Cape Town is getting a lesson in what it’s like to live in the informal settlements,” Mr Armitage says. “It goes down like a lead balloon.”', 'While Cape Town’s richest households have cut their usage the most, many have done so by installing private boreholes and storage tanks. “Rich people can survive the drought because they can buy water,” says Elias Tantsi, a Philippi resident. “They only care about us when there’s a vote.”', 'For township residents, acquiring flush toilets and washing machines are important signs of dignity. Willem Andrew, a scrap-dealer who lives on the edge of Villiersdorp’s shantytown, has stopped using his washing machine to stay within 50 litres. “Back to the old style, treading on the washing in the bath,” he says. “It’s heartbreaking to live like this.”', 'Two years after the 1994 elections, South Africa’s new democratic constitution included a right to water for all. “What Cape Town’s crisis has made clear is that we are very far from realising that right,” says Melita Steele, a campaigner for Greenpeace. It is connected to a deeper problem that helped shape Cape Town’s crisis response, Ms Steele says: “There has been clear failure in the governance, transparency and accountability of how water is managed in South Africa.”', 'What is perhaps most remarkable about Cape Town’s near-brush with Day Zero is that since 1999, the city’s demand for water has actually been steady, even as its population expanded by nearly a third. The data provide an important clue to how Cape Town survived but is also very revealing of the divides in South Africa’s fraught water politics.', 'Cape Town does not control its own bulk water supply. Responsibility lies with the national water department.', 'In the late 1990s, city officials asked the department to increase supply. It insisted on efficiency improvements to the system, which the city achieved by repairing leaks and reducing the system’s pressure. Steep tariffs for the heaviest users were rolled out alongside water meters. The difference between water supplied and billed is today around 15 per cent — “world class,” Mr Armitage says. Australian cities, among the most efficient in the world, lose 10 per cent. Yet South Africa is overexploiting most of its river systems, according to a report by the country’s Institute for Security Studies.', 'The national water department is controlled by Mr Ramaphosa’s ruling African National Congress, in power since 1994. The ANC’s biggest opposition, the Democratic Alliance, has led Cape Town since 2006 and won the Western Cape in 2009.', 'The two parties have traded blame for the water crisis. But more importantly, the national department “has pretty much collapsed”, Ms Steele says. Problems include overspending its R14bn ($1.1bn) budget by R2bn, while civil society groups have highlighted alleged irregularities. The ministry says its finances have been hit by debts owed to it by municipalities and budget cuts.', 'The ministry is one of several associated with institutional decay during the controversial nine-year presidency of Jacob Zuma. One of Mr Ramaphosa’s first acts after ousting Mr Zuma in February following a power struggle was to fire Nomvula Mokonyane, a Zuma ally, as water minister.', 'Cape Town has also invested, piloting a handful of desalination plants, wastewater treatment units and groundwater-extraction projects, increasing its capital spending budget by about $100m in a year. But these will contribute only 300m litres a day by 2020. Desalination is also especially expensive to operate, a problem underlined by Australia’s severe drought in the 2000s.', '“What we learnt from Australia is that you can spend billions on infrastructure that then isn’t used,” says Ms Zille. “The opportunity cost of that is much higher in South Africa than it is in Australia.”', 'The economic cost of averting Day Zero will take time to calculate. While South Africa’s economy stagnated during the Zuma years, Cape Town’s embrace of creative and service industries has meant it is booming in comparison.', 'Much of this high-end economy has adapted to scarce water. Top-tier restaurants have adopted special “dry” menus served on paper plates. Salons give discounts to customers who wash their hair before their appointment. Organisers of events, from cycle races to international business conferences, have shipped in their own supplies.', 'Some of the information aimed at getting heavy users to cut down has been so stark it may have had the unintended consequence of deterring tourists, says Tim Harris, the head of Wesgro, the Western Cape’s tourism and investment authority. But the city’s ability to adapt has also been a draw, he adds.', 'The biggest casualty will be farming. Half of South Africa’s $10bn-plus agricultural exports are from the Western Cape, especially high-value, water-intensive products such as citrus fruit and wine. Farmers have had to cut water use by 40 per cent. Releases from privately owned irrigation dams — normally used for crops and orchards — were also key to pushing Day Zero back.', 'Farmers warn they will be counting the cost in uprooted orchards and reduced harvests for years to come. Production has fallen by a fifth on average, according to city finance officials. Thousands of farmworkers face being laid-off, raising economic tension elsewhere. “If I don’t work, I’ll have to go home to the Eastern Cape,” one of South Africa’s poorest regions, says Bethwell Smith, an apple-picker.', 'Yet it could have been far worse. Cape Town narrowly averted disaster this year. But, says Mr Armitage, with the exhaustion of surface water globally, the world is unlikely to see many more Theewaterskloofs being built to prevent emergencies in the future.', '“We are officially at the end of the dam era,” he says. “Conservation is going to be the big game in town for the foreseeable future — and Cape Town has shown how to do it.”', 'More from the Financial Times:Trump says he reimbursed lawyer for porn star hush moneyObama holdout stands in way of US bank deregulatory waveMarrakesh’s housing market has room to haggle']"
5,The pain hustlers,2018-05-04T14:55:56+0000,"['Selling drugs is a relationship business. It’s best to do it in person. That is why, on a summer evening in 2012, Alec Burlakoff was out for dinner with Steven Chun, the owner of Sarasota Pain Associates. Burlakoff was a sales manager for Insys Therapeutics, an Arizona-based pharmaceutical company with only one branded product, a new and highly potent opioid painkiller called Subsys. Chun was a doctor who prescribed a lot of opioids.', 'The location was a moderately expensive seafood restaurant in Sarasota, Fla., with linen tablecloths and large windows overlooking the bay. The sun was still high in the sky. Gleaming powerboats lined the docks outside, and a warm breeze rippled the water. On one side of the table were Burlakoff and Tracy Krane, an Insys sales representative. Krane was a newcomer to the industry, tall with dark brown hair in a bob. Burlakoff, then 38, with a slight frame and a boyish restlessness, was her new boss. He had years of experience in the opioid market. Colleagues marveled over his shameless push to make the sale, but he had a charisma that was hard to resist. Even people who didn’t trust him couldn’t help liking him.', 'Krane was there to learn the business, and the meeting made a vivid impression. Chun, then 49 and stout, had impeccable credentials: He was trained at the University of Washington, Cornell Medical College and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. He had been married at the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church in Manhattan, to a Juilliard-trained violinist who is the daughter of a former chief executive of Korean Air, but had since divorced. At Burlakoff’s invitation, he had brought his girlfriend at the time, a woman in her mid-20s, to dinner.', 'More from the New York Times:Too bad Rudy doesn’t lie as well as TrumpTrump adds Clinton impeachment lawyer, bracing for a fight on multiple frontsGiuliani appears to veer off script. A furor follows.', 'For Insys, Chun was just the right kind of doctor to pursue. In the late 1990s, sales of prescription opioids began a steep climb. But by the time Subsys came to market in 2012, mounting regulatory scrutiny and changing medical opinion were thinning the ranks of prolific opioid prescribers. Chun was one of the holdouts, a true believer in treating pain with narcotics. He operated a busy practice, and 95 percent of the Medicare patients he saw in 2015 had at least one opioid script filled. Chun was also a top prescriber of a small class of painkillers whose active ingredient is fentanyl, which is 50 to 100 times as powerful as morphine. Burlakoff’s product was a new entry to that class. On a “target list,” derived from industry data that circulated internally at Insys, Chun was placed at No. 3. The word inside the company for a doctor like Chun was a “whale.”', 'In the few months since Subsys was introduced, demand was not meeting expectations. Some of the sales staff had already been fired. If Burlakoff and Krane could persuade Chun to become a Subsys loyalist, it would be a coup for them and for the entire company. The drug was so expensive that a single clinic, led by a motivated doctor, could generate millions of dollars in revenue.', 'Over dinner, Burlakoff grew expansive, Krane recalled. She marveled at the way he drew on a wealth of information about the doctor — intelligence gathered over the course of years — without letting on just how much he knew. Before he worked for Insys, Burlakoff worked for Cephalon, Insys’s chief competitor, and he knew a bit about Chun’s romantic history, Krane said. He also knew that Chun liked to visit the casinos up in Tampa, so Burlakoff made a point of talking about his own penchant for gambling, according to Krane. She had no idea if he was telling the truth.', 'It is unclear whether Burlakoff knew that Chun was also, at that moment, in the middle of an expensive legal battle. The previous year, two nurses who formerly worked for him secretly filed a whistle-blower suit charging “widespread billing schemes” intended to defraud the government, and federal agents executed a search warrant on his clinic. (Chun would later pay $750,000 to the Department of Justice to resolve the claims. He was never charged with a crime and denies all wrongdoing.)', 'What is clear is that Burlakoff thought that Chun was a tremendous prize. After briefly extolling the virtues of Subsys, Krane recalled, Burlakoff finally arrived at the true purpose of the dinner. He had a proposition to make. Insys wanted to sign Chun up, he said, for the company’s speaker program, which was just getting underway.', 'Speaker programs are a widely used marketing tool in the pharmaceutical business. Drug makers enlist doctors to give paid talks about the benefits of a product to other potential prescribers, at a clinic or over dinner in a private room at a restaurant. But Krane and some fellow rookie reps were already getting a clear message from Burlakoff, she said, that his idea of a speaker program was something else, and they were concerned: It sounded a lot like a bribery scheme.', 'Burlakoff left the dinner in a great mood, Krane said, confident that Chun would come on board. The doctor did become an Insys speaker later that year, and sales did improve, not only in Chun’s Florida office but also around the country, as more doctors signed on. By the next year, according to the company, net revenue from Subsys sales would increase by more than 1,000 percent,  to $95.7 million.', 'But the new reps were right to be worried. The Insys speaker program was central to Insys’ rapid rise as a Wall Street darling, and it was also central to the onslaught of legal troubles that now surround the company. Most notable, seven former top executives, including Burlakoff and the billionaire founder of Insys, John Kapoor, now await trial on racketeering charges in federal court in Boston. The company itself, remarkably, is still operating.', 'The reporting for this article involved interviews with, among other sources, seven former Insys employees, among them sales managers, sales reps and an insurance-authorization employee, some of whom have testified before a grand jury about what they witnessed. This account also draws on filings from a galaxy of Insys-related litigation: civil suits filed by state attorneys general, whistle-blower and shareholder suits and federal criminal cases. Some are pending, while others have led to settlements, plea deals and guilty verdicts.', 'In the Insys case, prosecutors are looking to break new ground in holding the pharmaceutical and medical industry accountable in connection with the current opioid crisis. They’re attacking both ends of the pharma sales transaction; 11 prescribers face charges or have been convicted over their ties to Insys, and Chun has recently been subpoenaed for medical records related to Subsys. In looking into Insys’s relationship to providers like him, investigators are revealing just how opioids are sold at the point they first enter the national bloodstream — in the doctor’s office.', 'THE OPIOID CRISIS, now the deadliest drug epidemic in American history, has evolved significantly over the course of the last two decades. What began as a sharp rise in prescription-drug overdoses has been eclipsed by a terrifying spike in deaths driven primarily by illicitly manufactured synthetic opioids and heroin, with overall opioid deaths climbing to 42,249 in 2016 from 33,091 in 2015. But prescription drugs and the marketing programs that fuel their sales remain an important contributor to the larger crisis. Heroin accounted for roughly 15,000 of the opioid deaths in 2016, for instance, but as many as four out of five heroin users started out by misusing prescription opioids.', 'By the time Subsys arrived in 2012, the pharmaceutical industry had been battling authorities for years over its role in promoting the spread of addictive painkillers. The authorities were trying to confine opioids to a select population of pain patients who desperately needed them, but manufacturers were pushing legal boundaries — sometimes to the breaking point — to get their products out to a wider market.', 'Even as legal penalties accrued, the industry thrived. In 2007, three senior executives of Purdue Pharma pleaded guilty in connection with a marketing effort that relied on misrepresenting the dangers of OxyContin, and the company agreed to pay a $600 million settlement. But Purdue continued booking more than $1 billion in annual sales on the drug. In 2008, Cephalon likewise  entered a criminal plea and agreed to pay $425 million for promoting an opioid called Actiq and two other drugs “off-label” — that is, for unapproved uses. That did not stop Cephalon from being acquired three years later, for $6.8 billion.', 'Subsys and Actiq belong to a class of fentanyl products called TIRF drugs. They are approved exclusively for the treatment of “breakthrough” cancer pain — flares of pain that break through the effects of the longer-acting opioids the cancer patient is already taking around the clock. TIRFs are niche products, but the niche can be lucrative because the drugs command such a high price. A single patient can produce six figures of revenue.', 'Fentanyl is extremely powerful — illicitly manufactured variations, often spiked into heroin or pressed into counterfeit pills, have become the leading killers in the opioid crisis — and regulators have made special efforts to restrict prescription fentanyl products. In 2008, for instance, the F.D.A. rebuffed Cephalon’s application to expand the approved use for a TIRF called Fentora; in the company’s clinical trials, the subjects who did not have cancer demonstrated much more addictive behavior and propensity to substance abuse, which are “rarely seen in clinical trials,” F.D.A. officials concluded. An F.D.A. advisory committee reported that, during the trials, some of the Fentora was stolen. The agency later developed a special protocol for all TIRF drugs that required practitioners to undergo online training and certify that they understood the narrow approved use and the risks.', 'Despite these government efforts, TIRF drugs were being widely prescribed to patients without cancer. Pain doctors, not oncologists, were the dominant players. This was common knowledge in the industry. Although it is illegal for a manufacturer to promote drugs for off-label use, it is perfectly legal for doctors to prescribe any drug off-label, on their own judgment. This allows drug makers like Insys to use a narrow F.D.A. approval as a “crowbar,” as a former employee put it, to reach a much broader group of people.', 'That points to a major vulnerability in policing the opioid crisis: Doctors have a great deal of power. The F.D.A. regulates drug makers but not practitioners, who enjoy a wide latitude in prescribing that pharmaceutical companies can easily exploit. A respected doctor who advocates eloquently for wider prescribing can quickly become a “key opinion leader”; invited out on the lucrative lecture circuit. And any doctor who exercises a free hand with opioids can attract a flood of pain patients and income. Fellow doctors rarely blow the whistle, and some state medical boards exercise timid oversight, allowing unethical doctors to continue to operate. An assistant district attorney coping with opioids in upstate New York told me that it’s easy to identify a pill-mill doctor, but “it can take five years to get to that guy.” In the meantime, drug manufacturers are still seeing revenue, and that doctor is still seeing patients, one after another, day after day.', 'JOHN KAPOOR, the founder of Insys, has flirted with legal trouble throughout his long career as a pharmaceutical entrepreneur. Raised in India, where he was the first in his family to go to college, he immigrated to the United States to pursue a doctorate, he has said, with five dollars in his pocket. He amassed a fortune with a series of pharmaceutical ventures, mostly in the unglamorous arena of generic drugs. One of his companies, Lyphomed, drew sanctions from the F.D.A. related to manufacturing problems, leading to recalls and a consent decree. After he sold Lyphomed to a Japanese firm in 1990, personally reaping more than $100 million, the buyer sued him, claiming that he had been deceptive about the company’s regulatory difficulties. He settled out of court. Another of Kapoor’s big investments, Akorn, was delisted from Nasdaq during his tenure as chief executive for filing unaudited financial statements, but his stake, held in trust, is now worth hundreds of millions, despite new controversy over possible breaches of F.D.A. requirements at the company.', 'Kapoor, now 74, bankrolled Insys almost entirely on his own for over a decade, shepherding Subsys on the long road to approval by the Food and Drug Administration. What motivated him, he has often said, was seeing his wife, Editha, suffering from metastatic breast cancer, before her death in 2005 at 54.', 'Often called Dr. Kapoor, he more closely resembles an academic than a business titan, with glasses and a signature mop of graying hair. But employees found that Kapoor could be aggressive and unyielding. At Insys he was known to pound the table; he dressed down a manager in front of colleagues. People who worked for him speak of the need to “survive” him.', 'Kapoor believed that he had the best product in its class. All the TIRF drugs — for transmucosal immediate-release fentanyl — deliver fentanyl through the mucous membranes lining the mouth or nose, but the specific method differs from product to product. Actiq, the first TIRF drug, is a lozenge on a stick. Cephalon’s follow-up, Fentora — the branded market leader when Subsys arrived — is a tablet meant to be held in the cheek as it dissolves. Subsys is a spray that the patient applies under the tongue. Spraying a fine mist at the permeable mouth floor makes for a rapid onset of action, trials showed.', 'Once the F.D.A. gave final approval to Subsys in early 2012, the fate of Insys Therapeutics rested on selling it in the field. The industry still relies heavily on the old-fashioned way of making sales; drug manufacturers blanket the country with representatives who call on prescribers face to face, often coming to develop personal relationships with them over time.', 'To carry out a delicate sales campaign, Insys made some unusual choices. Overseeing the launch under Kapoor, then the executive chairman, would be his 36-year-old protégé, Michael Babich, who had been named the Insys chief executive. A tall Chicagoan, Babich had worked for Kapoor in various roles since he was in his 20s, when Kapoor recruited him from an asset-management firm. Kapoor introduced Babich to the staff as a rising talent, but he had never led a sales effort for an F.D.A.-approved drug. According to former Insys managers, Babich tended to defer to Kapoor, who was, after all, putting up his own money.', 'To build the sales force, Insys hired a number of notably attractive people in their 20s and 30s, mostly women — not an uncommon tactic in the industry. But Insys reps tended to be particularly inexperienced, often with no background in pharmaceutical sales. “They were hiring people straight out of college,” said Jim Coffman, who worked as a regional sales trainer at Insys in 2012. “So there was a certain naïveté, which played into their objectives and goals.” The company was offering salaries well below market rates — typically paying a rep $40,000 when other companies would offer twice that amount — but dangling the lure of stock options and unusually large commissions.', 'Examining detailed TIRF sales data purchased from third parties, Insys executives zeroed in on an important fact: The entire market was anchored by a relatively small pool of prescribers. Winning the business of a handful of carefully selected practitioners per state could be enough to make Insys the market leader. The names at the top of the chart were well known in the field.', 'Insys managers divided the existing base of TIRF prescribers into deciles, according to how many scripts they wrote. The “high decile” practitioners tended not to specialize in treating cancer pain, according to the Boston indictment, but Insys went right after them. Sales reps were instructed to call on them multiple times a week, to the point of sitting in their waiting rooms for hours, angling for a moment with the doctor. As one manager told me, “You fish where the fish are.”', 'A SPEAKER PROGRAM was in the works at Insys from the start, but in the first months after Subsys hit the market, it had not gotten underway. During that period, Kapoor was disappointed by the sales of the drug, according to former employees. Managers thought the expectations were unrealistic, given that the company had beginner reps and entrenched competitors, but Kapoor didn’t want to hear it. He and Babich would soon meet with each regional sales manager one on one at the home office, and some meetings would be contentious. Turnover in the sales staff was running high.', 'It was then that Alec Burlakoff arrived, asking about a job. Burlakoff had a history that might have put off some potential employers. In 2002, Eli Lilly fired him as a sales rep amid an investigation by the Florida attorney general’s office into a supposed scheme to send unsolicited pills — a slow-release form of Prozac — to patients through the mail. When Burlakoff and two other fired employees sued Lilly in return, claiming the plan was approved by management, they gained media attention nationwide. Burlakoff said in a court filing that his reputation in the industry was permanently scarred. (The case was settled.) When Burlakoff later sold Actiq and Fentora at Cephalon, he was based in the Southeast region, a hot spot in the investigations into the promotion of both those drugs.', 'Former Insys employees consistently describe Burlakoff’s arrival as a turning point. Insys initially hired him to head the Southeast region, but within three months, he was promoted to run the entire sales force. The speaker program swiftly became the centerpiece of the sales effort, and Burlakoff made it clear how he wanted it to work.', 'He explained it all to Tracy Krane on the first day they met, she told me, while they were sitting in her white Cadillac CTS. It was a conversation she later recounted, she said, in a grand-jury proceeding in connection with the Boston criminal case. Burlakoff had traveled to her territory to join her on a “ride along,” coaching her through sales calls on an oppressively sunny day, and they had just left Chun’s office. The ostensible purpose of a pharma-speaker program, as Krane understood it, was to spread the word about the drug through peer-to-peer marketing. With “honorariums” changing hands, the potential for a subtle corruption is clear, but Burlakoff was not subtle. He told Krane, she said, that the real target was not the audience but the speaker himself, who would keep getting paid to do programs if and only if he showed loyalty to Subsys. It was a quid pro quo or, as the Department of Justice later called it, a kickback. “He boiled it right down,” Krane recalled: We pay doctors to write scripts. That’s what the speaker program is.', 'Krane didn’t know all the rules, she told me, but this didn’t sound right. She turned to Burlakoff and asked, “Isn’t that illegal?”', 'He brushed off the question, Krane said, with a tone she likened to patting a child on the head and telling her not to worry — the worst that could happen was the company would have to pay a settlement. If Burlakoff in fact said this, he had some reason. It was during his time at Cephalon that the company handily survived its penalty for engaging in illegal promotional schemes.', 'Emails that have surfaced in court and public-records requests give the flavor of the sales messages that top executives were sending. One week after Burlakoff was hired, Babich, the chief executive, wrote an email to his sales managers, directing them to make sure that reps understood “the important nature of having one of their top targets as a speaker. It can pay big dividends for them.” Burlakoff urged on his sales staff, peppering them with emails and texts that alternated between the tropes of motivational speaking (“we are all starting a new opportunity to be our very best when we get out of bed tomorrow!”) and arm-twisting reminiscent of “Glengarry Glen Ross.” “PROGRAMS ARE THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS,” he wrote. “WHY DO SOME OF YOU REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS PROVEN FACT?”', 'The speaker events themselves were often a sham, as top prescribers and reps have admitted in court. Frequently, they consisted of a nice dinner with the sales rep and perhaps the doctor’s support staff and friends, but no other licensed prescriber in attendance to learn about the drug. One doctor did cocaine in the bathroom of a New York City restaurant at his own event, according to a federal indictment. Some prescribers were paid four figures to “speak” to an audience of zero.', 'Burlakoff appears at first to have tried to shield Kapoor from the details of the Insys speaker programs, or I.S.P.s, as they were sometimes called in-house. “I need your guidance on how to present to Dr. Kapoor I.S.P.’s in a way — where he won’t get involved,” he wrote to Babich in an email obtained through a public-records request. Babich replied, “You got it.” Top executives, however, soon prepared documents for Kapoor, according to the Boston indictment, that explicitly calculated the I.S.P. “return on investment” for each speaker and indicated that underperformers could be culled from the program. Prosecutors have not yet presented evidence that Kapoor in fact saw the documents.', 'But Kapoor also had a direct contact out in the field, a New Jersey rep at the bottom of the hierarchy named Susan Beisler, who left a paper trail that could present legal difficulties for Kapoor. Beisler, then in her late 30s, seems to have had a close relationship with Kapoor, signing one email “many hugs and kisses,” according to a pending lawsuit filed by the New Jersey attorney general. Beisler complained to Kapoor that the speaker money “being thrown” at certain doctors was giving an unfair edge to their reps, particularly Burlakoff’s “friends,” according to the suit. Burlakoff had hired a number of Cephalon alumni he knew, reps who had pre-existing relationships with key doctors. As early as the summer of 2013, according to a federal indictment, an Insys rep — possibly Beisler — wrote to Kapoor that it was “so not right” that one high-prescribing doctor was “getting $2,500 a pop to eat at fancy steakhouses in NYC often,” adding, “I don’t think anyone even goes to his ’programs.” The following year, according to the Boston indictment, Insys quadrupled the budget devoted to the speaker program to $10 million. In the end, the Top 10 speakers each made more than $200,000.', 'INSYS WASN’T JUST winning over top TIRF prescribers from the competition. It was creating new ones. One star rep in Florida, later promoted to upper management, told another rep that when she went in search of potential speakers, she didn’t restrict herself to the top names, because, after all, any doctor can write scripts, and “the company does not give a [expletive] where they come from.” (Some dentists and podiatrists prescribed Subsys.) She looked for people, she said, “that are just going through divorce, or doctors opening up a new clinic, doctors who are procedure-heavy. All those guys are money hungry.” If you float the idea of becoming a paid speaker “and there is a light in their eyes that goes off, you know that’s your guy,” she said. (These remarks, recorded by the rep on the other end of the line, emerged in a later investigation.)', 'Unsurprisingly, tactics like these attracted some questionable figures to the program. In an email that surfaced in a lawsuit brought by the Illinois attorney general, a sales rep in the state reported directly to Babich about a pain-management doctor named Paul Madison: “Dr. Madison runs a very shady pill mill that only accepts cash,” the rep wrote. “He is extremely moody, lazy and inattentive. He basically just shows up to write his name on the prescription pad, if he shows up at all.” Insys was not deterred, it appears. According to the Boston indictment, Babich and Burlakoff hired a former exotic dancer named Sunrise Lee as a sales manager, and she helped court Madison as an Insys speaker. The company paid Madison tens of thousands dollars even after he was indicted on insurance-fraud charges that are still pending. (He pleaded not guilty.) According to the Illinois suit, which Insys later settled, he single-handedly accounted for 58 percent of the Subsys prescribed in Illinois over a three-year period.', 'In a March 2013 email to the sales force, Burlakoff singled out five reps at the top of the company leader board and noted that they “literally have their entire business being driven by basically one customer.” These “customers” were the top five Subsys prescribers in the nation, according to a pending lawsuit brought by the state of Arizona, and all were well-compensated Insys speakers. Three have been convicted of felonies; one has not been charged but had his license revoked. Only one remains in practice.', 'As a result of Insys’s approach to targeting doctors, its potent opioid was prescribed to patients it was never approved to treat — not occasionally, but tens of thousands of times. It is impossible to determine how many Subsys patients, under Kapoor, actually suffered from breakthrough cancer pain, but most estimates in court filings have put the number at roughly 20 percent. According to Iqvia data through September 2016, only 4 percent of all Subsys prescriptions were written by oncologists.', 'Jeff Buchalter, 34, a decorated Iraq war veteran, was one off-label Subsys patient. His doctor, William Tham, a paid Insys speaker, prescribed the drug to treat pain stemming from Buchalter’s wartime injuries, eventually raising the dose well beyond the maximum amount indicated by the F.D.A. Buchalter was taking it 12 times a day, not four to six, and alternating between the two highest doses, a medical chart from Tham’s clinic shows. Eventually, he had to be put under sedation in intensive care at Fort Belvoir, Va., while he went through withdrawal from Subsys and other prescription drugs. “I am frankly astonished at the amount of opioids the patient has been prescribed,” a hospital specialist noted in his records. Buchalter is suing Insys and Tham. (Tham’s lawyer, Andrew Vernick, told me, “He has done nothing wrong in this case, and he is not involved in any of the allegations that have been raised against Insys throughout the country.”)', 'Buchalter said Subsys gave him relief from pain, but it changed him into someone he did not recognize. He had always defined himself as a hard worker with integrity. With his eyes darting around the room as he spoke, he told me he became an addict, his day revolving around the next dose: He slept under his desk at the office, where boxes of Subsys filled the drawers, and his house went into foreclosure. Buchalter looked troubled and tired when we met. His hands were visibly dirty. “I’ve been absent from my life for years,” he told me. “What I remember is who I was when my daughter was born, and when I was a soldier.”', 'THE PREVALENCE OF off-label prescribing, while legal, did initially present Insys with a challenge. Owing to the risk and expense of Subsys, nearly all health insurers required prior authorization and would pay for the drug only for its sole approved use: breakthrough cancer pain. Only about one-third of Subsys prescriptions were being approved for reimbursement in late 2012. So Insys created an internal division dedicated to improving that number.', 'According to a former employee and multiple court filings, including a manager’s guilty plea, the company offered to relieve doctors’ offices of insurance hassles and take on the task of getting prescriptions covered. Insys’ “prior authorization specialists” — workers who the company motivated with bonuses — would contact insurers or their contractors, giving the impression they were calling from the prescribing doctor’s office. They used what managers called “the spiel,” which led insurers to believe that patients had cancer when they did not. Sometimes they would falsify medical charts and outright lie, former staff members have acknowledged. Babich, the chief executive, was involved in arranging for this unit’s phone system to block Caller ID to disguise the fact that calls were not coming from the doctor’s office, according to the Boston indictment.', 'The initiative worked. By the following spring, a company estimate pegged the approval rate for commercial insurers at 87 percent.', 'With insurance approval now catching up with prescriptions, Insys revenue and market share were climbing sharply, but a serious threat was brewing within. Within six months of the Subsys launch, one rep based in Texas, Ray Furchak, started to consider reporting Insys to government authorities. The speaker program, he felt, amounted to a thinly disguised kickback scheme, and he was also concerned that management was pushing an overly high dose of Subsys to first-time patients, despite boldface F.D.A. warnings of the dangers. Furchak began to collect emails and texts as evidence.', 'He soon filed a whistle-blower complaint against the company, as well as John Kapoor. But the defendants did not know they had been sued for months — the case proceeded under seal.', 'While Insys’s fortunes were on the rise, Furchak’s suit was under review at the Justice Department. In cases like his, called qui tams, a whistle-blower sues on behalf of the government, claiming fraud, and stands to share in any recovered funds. Justice Department lawyers quietly conducted interviews, weighing whether to intervene and join the plaintiff in the suit. It was one of hundreds of decisions like it that qui tam investigators face at any given time. An investigator at the Department of Health and Human Services, Michael Cohen, told me the federal government faces an overwhelming amount of health care fraud: “We call it a tsunami.”', 'Fortunately for Insys, the Justice Department declined to intervene in Furchak’s case. A lawyer familiar with the decision cited the difficulty of proving significant damages; Insys was not a big fish yet. Furchak did what most people do in this situation: He dropped the suit. The judge ordered his complaint unsealed, but the media took no notice at the time. Insys was free to go on doing what it was doing. It would be a long time before the law caught up to it.', 'In May 2013, two months after the Justice Department decision, the company went public. At an event at the Nasdaq MarketSite in Times Square, Kapoor and Babich stood smiling, surrounded by a group of cheering Insys executives.', 'By the end of 2013, Subsys would become the most widely prescribed branded TIRF,  according to a company S.E.C. filing. In an ebullient “State of the Union” message to the sales force that October, Babich joked about hiring midget wrestlers to perform at the next national sales meeting. Now the competition was going to come after Insys, he said. “One problem they have ... they don’t have a chance in hell!”', 'Insys became the year’s best-performing initial public offering, on a gain of over 400 percent. That December, the company disclosed that it had received a subpoena from the Office of the Inspector General at Health and Human Services, an ominous sign. But a CNBC interviewer made no mention of it when he interviewed Babich a few weeks later. Instead he said, “Tell us what it is about Insys that has investors so excited.”', 'BY THEN, THOUGH, Insys management had identified a potential worry in the Southeast region. Xiulu Ruan and John Patrick Couch, each a well-compensated Insys speaker, jointly owned and operated a pain clinic in Mobile, Ala., that served thousands of clients. Their main location occupied a one-story brown building on a commercial strip on the western outskirts of the city, adjacent to a Shell station.', 'Ruan was able to successfully recommend an Insys rep for their territory, a 27-year-old named Natalie Perhacs. Ruan had been asking her out to dinner for several months, to no avail; now she would be in his clinic several times a week. In her previous job, Perhacs’s salary was just over $30,000, but in two years selling Subsys almost exclusively to Ruan and Couch, she made $700,000. (Perhacs later pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate a federal anti-kickback statute.)', 'Ruan and Couch had many patients legitimately in need of pain treatment. But it would be difficult to miss, from regularly visiting the clinic or from prescribing data alone, that something was awry. “Oh, everybody knew it,” a nurse at a different Mobile practice told me.', 'In 2014, the doctors each averaged one prescription for a controlled substance roughly every four minutes, figuring on a 40-hour week. A typical pill mill makes its money from patients paying in cash for their appointments, but Ruan and Couch had a different model: A majority of their scripts were filled at a pharmacy adjacent to their clinic called C&R — for Couch and Ruan — where they took home most of the profits. The pharmacy sold more than $570,000 of Subsys in a single month, according to Perhacs’s criminal plea. Together the two men amassed a collection of 23 luxury cars.', 'Two former patients told me that people approached them to buy or sell prescription drugs in the clinic’s parking lot. “There was always one or two out there,” Alice Byrd Jordan said.', 'One patient, Keith Bumpers, told me that he had thought his doctor at the clinic was “Dr. Justin.” Justin Palmer was a nurse practitioner who testified that he routinely forged Couch’s name on prescriptions. He was one of three medical staff members at the clinic who were personally misusing painkillers at work. One of them died by suicide; the other two admitted seeing patients while impaired. A patient named Tamisan Witherspoon, who was prescribed Subsys off-label and became addicted, testified that a nurse practitioner at the clinic, Bridgette Parker, spoke incoherently and collapsed asleep in an exam room in front of her. Witherspoon recognized the state Parker was in, because she had been there herself, she said, from taking Subsys. “I started to cry,” Witherspoon said on the witness stand, “because I realized that she was in trouble and so was I.”', 'In court testimony, Perhacs acknowledged that in late 2013, there was a “sense of panic” at Insys regarding the situation at the clinic in Mobile. The problem was that the clinic wasn’t generating enough money for the company.', '“Dr. Ruan and Dr. Couch are way down,” Burlakoff wrote to Perhacs. “Can you assist please. ... This was the topic of conversation today with Dr. Kapoor and Mike.”', 'In fact, Couch and Ruan were still writing a lot of Subsys scripts. But they had started prolifically prescribing a Subsys competitor too: Abstral, then made by Galena Biopharma. One reason Insys was losing out on potential sales, according to the Boston indictment, was that C&R Pharmacy was having trouble getting enough Subsys from distributors to keep it in stock — because of measures designed to combat the opioid crisis.', 'The flow of controlled substances through distributors, which are the middlemen between drug companies and pharmacies, is strictly regulated, and distributors have paid hefty settlements for failing to notify the Drug Enforcement Administration of “suspicious orders” of controlled substances from particular pharmacies. Couch and Ruan’s pharmacy was hitting caps with their distributor, according to Perhacs’s testimony — an “enormous barrier,” a manager wrote to her. In internal emails cited in the Boston indictment, leadership scrambled to find a way to beat the competition and get around the caps at the same time. One executive wrote that “certain parties would be at risk” if they were not careful. Sales reps in the region felt they needed assistance. A manager wrote to Perhacs, “Hopefully with a little help from above we can land this.”', 'On Feb. 13, 2014, the help arrived. Two men flew to Alabama to have dinner at a steakhouse with Couch and Ruan and their pharmacists, booking rooms for the night at the Renaissance Hotel by the Mobile River. The two men who flew to Mobile for this meeting were the chief executive, Michael Babich, and the billionaire founder of Insys Therapeutics, John Kapoor.', 'Over dinner, according to the Boston indictment, Kapoor and Babich struck a remarkable agreement with the pharmacists and the doctors, who were operating a clinic rife with opioid addiction among the staff: Insys would ship Subsys directly to C&R Pharmacy. An arrangement like this is “highly unusual” and a “red flag,” according to testimony from a D.E.A. investigator in a related trial. As part of the terms of the deal, the pharmacy would make more money on selling the drug, with no distributor in the loop. And there would be another anticipated benefit for all involved: Everyone could sell more Subsys without triggering an alert to the D.E.A.', 'IT WAS NOT long after that dinner in Alabama that the troubles at Insys came more clearly into public view. Early in 2014, according to a former employee at Insys headquarters cited in a shareholder suit, top executives learned that a major Subsys “whale” based in Michigan, Gavin Awerbuch, was under investigation. Awerbuch was a well-paid speaker and, by a large margin, the top prescriber of Subsys to Medicare patients. Further details have emerged in the Boston indictment and other court filings. Burlakoff had personally cultivated Awerbuch, flying to Michigan to take him out to dinner and then writing an email to colleagues: “Expect a nice ‘bump’ fellas.”', 'As it turned out, unfortunately for Insys, Awerbuch was under the eye of authorities even before Subsys went on the market. He was submitting insurance claims for bogus tests and liberally writing opioid scripts. As investigators closed in on him, his fondness for a new drug called Subsys caught their eye. He prescribed it to one patient complaining of mild to moderate back pain. That patient was an undercover agent.', 'Awerbuch was arrested in May 2014 and charged with illegally prescribing Subsys and insurance fraud. Insys’s stock took an immediate hit, on heavy trading volume.', 'In an email the previous September, Burlakoff had written to Babich and others, “Let’s make some money,” adding that it was the Awerbuchs “of the world that keep us in business, let’s get a few more.” Now Insys executives scrambled to distance themselves from the doctor. Subsys was not sold directly to doctors, who make their own decisions, they explained in a news release: “Insys only sells Subsys through D.E.A. approved wholesalers who monitor and track prescribing activity.”', 'With news of Awerbuch’s arrest, the New Jersey sales rep Susan Beisler wrote to a friend: “Yup. [Expletive].” When the friend responded that it was bad for the doctor but not for Insys, Beisler replied: “The thing is they bribed the [expletive] out of that guy to write. The complaint shows ten other docs they also bribed.”', 'It was a telling remark: In fact, the Awerbuch criminal complaint merely presented a chart of the Top 10 Subsys prescribers to Medicare patients. Names were withheld, but other details were provided. An executive at Galena, then the maker of Abstral, sent a screenshot of the list to Ruan, who was easily identifiable. The next day, Ruan began redirecting his Insys speaker fees to philanthropic purposes. “He runs away from that Insys money as fast as he can,” the assistant United States attorney Christopher Bodnar later told a jury.', 'With Awerbuch’s fall, Beisler apparently thought that Insys was done, but for her bosses, and for their investors, this wasn’t over. After a dip, revenues recovered and the stock resumed its climb. Insys kept paying speaker fees to physicians with disciplinary histories — and doing so out in the open, because a newly implemented provision of the Affordable Care Act meant that drug makers’ payments to doctors were now publicly posted. Burlakoff continued on the job for more than a year. Investors shrugged over the Awerbuch news and the bad press surrounding the speaker program. The subpoena Insys had received about its sales practices was “not particularly unusual,” one bullish Wall Street analysis noted later that year, adding, “we’re pretty sure that the worst-case outcome for Insys is some sort of fine.” The first hard-hitting reportof several by Roddy Boyd of the Southern Investigative Reporting Foundation, in April 2015, jolted the stock, but again it recovered and moved higher, with sales still climbing.', 'Insys sustained another blow when federal agents descended on Ruan and Couch’s clinic in Mobile in May 2015. They were there to seize evidence and arrest the doctors, Kapoor and Babich’s dinner companions the previous year.', 'The local medical community felt the impact of the raid. Because refills are generally not allowed on controlled substances, patients typically visited the clinic every month. For days, dozens of them lined up outside in the morning, fruitlessly trying to get prescriptions from the remaining staff or at least retrieve their medical records to take elsewhere. But other providers were either booked up or would not take these patients. “Nobody was willing to give the amount of drugs they were on,” a nurse in the city said. Melissa Costello, who heads the emergency room at Mobile Infirmary, said her staff saw a surge of patients from the clinic in the ensuing weeks, at least a hundred, who were going through agonizing withdrawal.', 'Two months after the raid in Mobile, Insys’ stock reached an all-time high.', 'AT DAWN ONE MORNING LAST OCTOBER, several S.U.V.s entered a gated community in Phoenix and drove up a mountainside road. Federal agents climbed out and entered a sprawling house with their weapons drawn.  They took John Kapoor into custodyat 7 a.m. When he appeared eight hours later in federal court, surrounded by indigent defendants being arraigned at the same time, he was wearing untied running shoes and gym shorts that appeared to be on backward.', 'Prosecutors had advanced from targeting lower-level employees toward the heart of the company, securing some guilty pleas along the way, including one from Michael Babich’s wife, Natalie Levine, a former Insys rep, on bribery charges. Babich, Burlakoff, Sunrise Lee and three other former senior Insys executives were indicted simultaneously on bribery and fraud charges, and months passed while Insys insiders wondered whether Kapoor would go untouched. Now they had their answer.', 'Kapoor and the six other executives charged in Boston have pleaded not guilty and await trial, scheduled for January. For prosecutors at the Department of Justice, this is uncharted territory. When pharmaceutical companies have been heavily penalized over marketing schemes and fraud, their leaders have typically settled the cases — or, more rarely, pleaded to misdemeanors — and walked away. The Insys defendants not only face criminal prosecution but stand accused of racketeering under the RICO Act, a law more commonly invoked against organized-crime families and drug gangs. The industry will be paying attention.', 'Kapoor’s lawyer, Beth Wilkinson, declined to comment in detail on the case, but did say, “We will vigorously defend Dr. Kapoor in court.” Lawyers for Burlakoff, Babich, Lee, Levine and Madison either declined or did not respond to detailed requests for comment. A lawyer for Beisler, who has not been charged with a crime, also declined to comment. Awerbuch pleaded guilty to accepting bribes and health care fraud and has been sentenced to jail time. Ruan and Couch were convicted on  multiple felony counts and are in prison. They have appealed. Krane was fired by Insys in November 2012; the company cited poor sales performance. She no longer works in the drug industry.', 'Insys itself is still producing Subsys, though sales have fallen considerably. (Overall demand for TIRFs has declined industrywide.) The company is now marketing what it calls the “first and only F.D.A.-approved liquid dronabinol,” a synthetic cannabinoid, and is developing several other new drugs. Some analysts like the look of the company’s pipeline of new drugs and rate the stock a “buy.”  In a statement, the company said its new management team consists of “responsible and ethical business leaders” committed to effective compliance. Most of its more than 300 employees are new to the company since 2015, and its sales force is focused on physicians “whose prescribing patterns support our products’ approved indications,” the company said. Insys has ended its speaker program for Subsys.', 'In Florida, Dr. Steven Chun is still seeing patients. The indictment against the Insys executives details the company’s relationship to 10 unnamed Subsys prescribers. Having worked to identify all of them, I was virtually certain that Chun is “Practitioner #9.” Three others have already been sentenced to prison time; Chun has not been charged with any crime. In February, after multiple attempts to contact him, I visited his Florida clinic unannounced.', 'Chun works out of the third floor of a two-tone stucco building flanked by palm trees, in prosperous Lakewood Ranch, a master-planned community. Adjacent to the medical complex housing his clinic is a tidy outdoor retail and entertainment area called Main Street at Lakewood Ranch. In Chun’s orderly waiting room, when I visited, an elderly man with a walker and a plaid shirt sat silently under the fluorescent lights. The clinic looked nothing like the pill mill that I had stopped by a few days earlier. It looked like a doctor’s office.', 'I did not expect Chun to agree to see me, but I was led down a long hallway into his personal office. Wearing dark blue scrubs with his name embroidered at the breast, he shook my hand and motioned for me to sit on a red leather sofa while he sat back in his chair, taking a sip from a thermos. A framed diploma hung on the wall behind him.', 'The practice of pain management has changed since Chun was in training in the 1990s, he said. There are so many regulations. People in pain have fewer and fewer places to go. And now, he said, he’s caught up in this Insys case.', 'Chun said that his prescribing of Subsys had nothing to do with the money that Insys paid him (more than $275,000, according to the Boston indictment). He believed in the product and he enjoyed doing the speaker programs. It suited his ego to take a teaching role, he said, smiling.', 'Asked for comment at press time, Chun defended his practice, saying he has never been accused of malpractice or disciplined by the state of Florida. He has complied with subpoenas related to Subsys, he said, and he has not been contacted directly by investigators in connection with Insys. He said a vast majority of his TIRF prescriptions are on-label, for patients with cancer or a history of cancer. He said he always tells patients, “Unless you have cancer, I’m not going to prescribe this for you.”', 'Chun said Subsys prescriptions went up 10 percent at most after he joined the speaker program. (The Boston indictment contradicts this account.) He said he only heard about the Insys “scam” after he left the program and saw no reason he was being associated with doctors who participated. He concluded, “I follow the rules.”', 'While Chun and I were speaking, staff members knocked on the door and entered every 30 minutes or so, carrying pieces of paper for Chun to sign. Chun explained that the nurse practitioner he worked with is not licensed to prescribe Schedule II controlled substances, the most tightly regulated category of legal drugs. The sheets of paper were prescriptions, and he signed them two to four at a time without pausing to read them over. As soon as the knock came on the door, without looking down, he would make a swift motion with his hand to retrieve his pen from his breast pocket and click the button on the top.', 'Down the hall, patients were presumably making the trip, in that cycle familiar to us all, from the waiting room to the exam room and finally home. Naturally the patient in the next room had no idea what Chun and I were discussing.

The possible demise of the cargo carrier has tourists,  aviation buffs and many in the museum world concerned about the  fate of the affiliated Evergreen Air & Space Museum. ', '  In Oregon’s wine country, about 40 miles southwest of Portland,  the museum welcomes about 150,000 visitors a year. The collection  includes everything from a Lockheed  SR-71 Blackbird to a Boeing B-17  Flying Fortress.', '  But the centerpiece of the collection is undoubtedly the original  Spruce Goose.', '  Built primarily of lightweight birch because of World War  II restrictions on metals, the airplane has the world’s  largest wingspan (320 feet) and made its only flight—of less  than a mile—on Nov. 2, 1947, with Hughes himself at the  controls. It then was put in storage. ', '  During the 1980s, the craft was displayed under a dome in  Long Beach, Calif., next to the Queen Mary cruise  ship. Disney briefly managed that money-losing complex. In the early 1990s, however, the Spruce Goose  was shipped to Oregon in pieces and reassembled inside a new building at the Evergreen Aviation &  Space Museum.', '  (Read more: Say goodbye  to the world’s longest flight)', '  Although an Oregon Department of Justice investigation is  underway into possible inappropriate commingling of company and  museum funds, officials at the museum  have issued statements reassuring the public that the artifacts,  especially the Spruce Goose, are safe; that the museum is an  independent, financially stable nonprofit; and that,  with its adjacent aviation-themed water park, it remains  open for business.', 'Still, “there has been some confusion,” said Judiaann Woo,  director of global communication at Travel Oregon.', '  “People just hear a bit of the story and think, ‘Oh, that’s  closed. Let’s go somewhere else,’ ” she said. “But this is a major attraction  that people from all over the world come to see, so we want to  make sure the public knows it’s still there.” ', '  (Read more: Pot tourism ready to light up in Colorado in  2014)', '  Others in the aviation and museum world feel the same way.

', '  He considers a visit to the Spruce Goose to be “one of those boxes  you’d want to check off if you have an interest in science,  space, aviation and things that made this nation great,” he said. He hopes the museum does not suffer too much negative fallout from  the financial woes of Evergreen International Aviation.', '  If it does, it won’t be the first—or the last—museum to stumble.

group which tracks the conflict via  a network of sources within the country.', '  Ground attacks by Syrian government forces and their militia  allies using heavy surface-to-surface missile bombardments hit at  least four insurgent positions and there were heavy clashes, the  head of the Observatory, Rami Abdulrahman, said.', '  The Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia took part in the fighting,  according to a regional source who is familiar with the military  situation in Syria.', '  Abdulrahman said later there was no sign that Syrian troops and  their allies had made any tangible advances on the ground.', '  They briefly entered one town, but were forced to pull back, he  said, and around 15 of their tanks or armoured vehicles had been  either destroyed or disabled.', '  Islamic State militants have seized much of Syria since civil war  grew out of anti-government protests in 2011, but the areas  targeted in Wednesday’s combined assault are held by other  rebels, some U.S.-backed, fuelling accusations by Russia’s  critics that its real aim is to help the government.', '  Moscow says it shares the West’s aim of preventing the spread of  Islamic State, and Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu told  President Vladimir Putin during a televised meeting that four  Russian warships in the Caspian Sea had launched 26 missiles at  Islamic State in Syria earlier in the day.', '  The missiles would have passed over Iran and Iraq to reach their  targets, covering what Shoigu described as a distance of almost  1,500 km (900 miles), the latest display of Russian military  power at a time when relations with the West are at a post-Cold  War low over Ukraine.', '  The terrain-hugging Kalibr cruise missiles, known by NATO by the  codename Sizzler, fly at an altitude of 50 metres and are  accurate to within three metres, the Russian defence ministry  said.', '  The air campaign in Syria has caught Washington and its allies on  the back foot and alarmed Syria’s northern neighbour Turkey,  which says its air  space has been repeatedly violated by Russian jets.', '  Ankara summoned Russia’s ambassador for the third time in four  days over the reported violations, which NATO has said appeared  to be deliberate and were “extremely dangerous”.', '  Turkey said Syria-based missile systems harassed its warplanes on  Tuesday while eight F-16 jets were on a patrol flight along the  Syria border.', ' Iraq looks to Russia', '  Syrian state television quoted a military source as saying the  missiles fired by Russian ships targeted 11 Islamic State  positions in Raqqa, Aleppo and Idlib.', '  The missiles destroyed bomb-making factories, command posts,  weapons and ammunition and fuel depots, as well as “terrorist  training centres”, the TV said.', ' Read MoreWest and Mideast slam  Russia over Syria airstrikes', '  Russian air strikes destroyed the main weapons depots of a  U.S.-trained rebel group, the Liwa Suqour al-Jabal, their

8,"The company Michael Cohen kept — “Trump, Inc.” Podcast",2018-04-19T17:01:46+0000,"['Find “Trump, Inc.” wherever you get your podcasts.', 'If you’ve seen video or images of Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, they’ve probably been set in locations that exude power and importance: Cohen berating a CNN anchor in a TV studio, for example, or striding across the sleek marbled interior of Trump Tower, or more recently, smoking cigars in front of Cohen’s temporary residence, the Loews Regency Hotel on Manhattan’s Park Avenue.', 'But to understand how Michael Cohen arrived in those precincts, you need to venture across New York City’s East River. There, in a Queens warehouse district in the shadows of an elevated No. 7 subway line, is a taxi garage that used to house his law practice. The office area in the front is painted a garish taxicab-yellow, with posters of hockey players on the wall and a framed photo of the late Hasidic rabbi Menachem Schneerson. Cohen practiced law there and invested in the once-lucrative medallions that grant New York cabs the right to operate.', 'More from ProPublica: Chicago’s gang database is full of errors — and records we have prove itWhite House Chief of Staff contradicts White House claim on VA shakeupSix things we’ve learned in six months', 'Or you could drive 45 minutes deep into Brooklyn, near where Gravesend turns into Brighton Beach. There, in a desolate stretch near a shuttered podiatrist’s office, you’d find a medical office. According to previously unexamined records, Cohen incorporated a business there in 2002 that was involved in large quantities of medical claims. Separately, he represented more than 100 plaintiffs who claimed they were injured in auto collisions.', 'At the same time, in Brooklyn and Long Island, New York prosecutors were investigating what Fortune magazine called possibly “the largest organized insurance-fraud ring in U.S. history.” That fraud resulted in hundreds of criminal prosecutions for staging car accidents to collect insurance payments. Cohen was not implicated in the fraud.', 'A distinctive pattern emerged early in Cohen’s career, according to an examination by WNYC and ProPublica for the “Trump, Inc.” podcast: Many of the people who crossed paths with Cohen when he worked in Queens and Brooklyn were disciplined, disbarred, accused or convicted of crimes.', 'Cohen, 51, has always emerged unscathed — until now. Last week, his Rockefeller Center office was raided by federal agents, as were his home, hotel room, safety deposit box and two cellphones. Cohen is under criminal investigation by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. According to court papers, investigators are examining whether he committed fraud and showed a “lack of truthfulness.”', 'He and his attorneys did not respond to a lengthy set of questions emailed to them. Cohen’s lawyers have stated that he has done nothing improper.', 'Cohen has attained national attention as the man who paid Stormy Daniels $130,000 to keep her alleged affair with Trump secret. He also negotiated a $1.6 million settlement with a woman impregnated by Trump fundraiser Elliott Broidy. (Cohen’s attorney told a judge on Monday that his only three legal clients over the past 15 months were Trump, Broidy and talk-show host Sean Hannity.)', 'Cohen has for decades had close personal and professional relationships with many citizens of the former Soviet Union. He ended up as point men on Trump’s deals there and also turned up in the notorious Russia “dossier.” He has routinely been described as an indispensable man to Donald Trump.', 'One indicator of that, according to The New York Times: President Trump is more agitated by what those New York prosecutors may find in Cohen’s files than he is by the wide-ranging investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller. Cohen, it seems, may hold some crucial secrets. What’s more surprising, perhaps, is the path he took to get to that point.', '________________________________________________________________________________________', 'Michael Cohen grew up in the Five Towns area of Long Island, New York, a heavily Jewish enclave. His father was a surgeon, according to media reports, and Cohen enjoyed a top-tier education, graduating from the private Lawrence Woodmere Academy, then moving on to American University.', 'From there, it seems, Cohen’s educational trajectory turned in a different direction. He attended the Thomas M. Cooley School of Law in Michigan, which, InsideHigherEd.com once wrote, “is known for admitting students other law schools would not touch.”', 'In 1992, after law school, he returned to his home region and landed a job working for a personal injury attorney named Melvyn Estrin, who had an office on lower Broadway in Manhattan.', 'Estrin was the first in a series of colleagues who would run afoul of authorities. Within three years of Cohen’s arrival, Estrin was charged with bribing insurance adjusters to inflate damage estimates and expedite claims. He later pleaded guilty. Cohen was never implicated in any of the misdeeds. Estrin did not respond to a request for comment. He is still practicing law.', 'Cohen continued to use Estrin’s address on legal filings as late as 1999, but he added several new addresses during this period, including 22-05 43rd Ave., in Long Island City, Queens — the taxi garage. It was the headquarters of the New York branch of the empire of Simon Garber, a Soviet emigre who also has had cab companies in Chicago and Moscow. Charismatic and silver-haired, Garber released kitschy TV-style advertisements, in Russian, for his company.', 'Over the years, Garber has been convicted of assault in New York, arrested for battery in Miami and pleaded guilty in New Jersey to charges of criminal mischief involving him breaking into three neighbors’ homes, shattering glass doors, smearing blood all over and taking a shower. In Chicago, his taxi fleet included wrecked vehicles with illegally laundered titles.', 'Garber did not respond to a request for comment. (Two other attorneys had offices inside Garber’s offices in the early 2000s. One was forced to resign from the bar after he was accused of not turning money over to a client. The other was disbarred, in part for trying to steal money from the first lawyer.)', 'In 1994 Cohen married Laura Shusterman, who was born in the Soviet Union. Her father, also a taxi entrepreneur, pleaded guilty to a felony, conspiracy to defraud the IRS, the year before.', 'By the late 1990s, records show, Cohen had begun acquiring taxi medallions, licenses required by the City of New York to operate a yellow cab. The number of medallions has been strictly controlled for decades. Before the advent of services like Uber, they were particularly valuable, with their price peaking at over $1 million in 2014.', 'Cohen co-owned some of the medallions with his wife, and indeed, his family and business relationships sometimes overlapped. Filings show his father-in-law once made a loan to Garber. And in 2001, Cohen borrowed money for one of his taxi companies, Golden Child Cab Corp., from one of the men convicted with Cohen’s father-in-law, Fima Shusterman, in the fraud against the IRS.', 'Starting around 2000, Cohen was involved in scores of car insurance lawsuits, often on behalf of plaintiffs who claimed to have been injured in auto collisions and were seeking judgments to cover purported medical expenses.', 'At this time, a wave of staged auto accidents, involving immigrants from the former Soviet Union who claimed to have been hurt, had led prosecutors to open a massive investigation. They dubbed it Operation Boris, an acronym for Big Organized Russian Insurance Scam. The prosecutorial push resulted in hundreds of convictions.', 'Cohen also drew up incorporation papers for at least three medical practices and three medical billing companies. One company Cohen registered in 2002, Avex Medical Care PRC, sued insurance companies nearly 300 times. The plaintiffs lawyer in almost all of these cases was David Katz, who was disbarred later for professional misconduct.', 'The doctor who owned Avex was charged in 2003 with criminal insurance fraud connected with another medical business; the charge was dismissed. He’s now practicing medicine in New Jersey.', 'Dr. Zhanna Kanevsky, the principal of Life Quality Medical, a clinic business that Cohen incorporated in 2002, surrendered her medical license after pleading guilty to writing phony prescriptions for 100,000 oxycodone and other pills.', 'Once again, Cohen was never charged.', '________________________________________________________________________________________', 'In the early 2000s, Trump and Cohen became connected, fittingly, through real estate. Cohen started to transfer the wealth he’d gained from taxi medallions and insurance lawsuits to apartments in Trump buildings. Along with his parents, his in-laws, and Simon Garber, Cohen acquired eight units in Trump Palace, Trump Park Avenue, and Trump World Plaza. The man who operated out of a Queens taxi garage now owned apartments alongside the likes of Sophia Loren and Harrison Ford.', 'Cohen also began to show political ambitions. In 2003, he ran for City Council on Manhattan’s Upper East Side as a Republican. Even people close to his campaign weren’t sure why he ran.', 'His own campaign biography provided few answers — or rather, disparate ones. He claimed at the time to own 200 taxi medallions, to be a member of the Friars Club, an avid stamp collector, and a member of the Metropolitan Transit Authority’s Inspector General advisory board.', 'Cohen lost the City Council race, but his donor list provides a snapshot of his network. He received contributions from his father, his father-in-law, and Bruce Winston, a son of the jeweler Harry Winston. A New York Republican with knowledge of Cohen’s 2003 campaign said Cohen told him then that he was Harry Winston’s in-house counsel at the time. The company says Cohen was never an employee.', 'Court papers show Cohen was one of the lawyers who helped Bruce Winston, and his daughter, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, in a legal action challenging Deutsche Bank’s conduct as trustee of Harry Winston’s estate. Their petition failed. (For her part, Wolkoff, a friend of Melania Trump’s, later became the highest-paid contractor for Donald Trump’s inauguration, taking in an eye-popping $26 million, and sparking a backlash.)', 'It’s unclear when Cohen and Trump first met, but the two were publicly linked in February 2007. The New York Post published an article then about an attorney who was purchasing large numbers of apartments in Trump buildings. “Trump properties are solid investments,” Cohen told the Post. Trump returned the compliment, declaring Cohen to be a wise investor. “Michael Cohen has a great insight into the real-estate market,” he told the Post. “He has invested in my buildings because he likes to make money — and he does.”', 'Three months later, Cohen became an executive vice president at the Trump Organization, with the same job title as Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric Trump.', 'Cohen was never a traditional in-house lawyer for Trump. He has been described as both a “fixer” and a “dealmaker” — and it seems he embraced both roles. “He did jobs for Donald that no one else would do,” said one person who worked with Cohen, “especially not a lawyer. He did a lot of these jobs.”', 'Still, even after Cohen had joined the Trump Organization, he harbored personal political dreams. In 2010, Cohen mounted a second unsuccessful campaign, this time for the New York state Senate. Among his donors in that race were shipping magnate Oleg Mitnik and tobacco tycoon and New York real estate man Howard Lorber, one of Donald Trump’s closest friends.', 'Cohen continued to expand his role within the Trump universe. It had become simultaneously global, national and highly local. The Trump Organization’s business model had shifted, from building high-end Manhattan properties to scoping for international licensing deals, particularly in the former Soviet Union. Cohen, along with Trump’s adult children, headed up this effort.', 'At a Trump Tower press conference in early 2011, Cohen took the public stage as an international dealmaker. “Seven months ago, at the request of a dear friend of mine from Georgia, Giorgi Rtskhiladze, I traveled to the Republic of Georgia to explore several real estate opportunities on behalf of Mr. Trump,” Cohen said in his unmistakable Long Island accent. He then introduced Trump and the then-president of Georgia, Mikhail Saakashvili.', 'The ostensible purpose of the press conference was to talk up a planned tower in the city of Batumi, on the Black Sea coast. But most of the questions centered on Donald Trump’s possible run for president.', 'Months earlier, Michael Cohen had helped set up a website called shouldtrumprun.com with the Long Island law firm Gerstman Schwartz & Malito. (David Schwartz is a longtime Cohen friend and attorney who made several television appearances on Cohen’s behalf when the Stormy Daniels news broke.) Cohen also traveled to Iowa to explore the political terrain.', 'Shouldtrumprun.com was billed as independent of Trump; otherwise Trump would have had to file papers with the Federal Election Commission on his own behalf. At the press conference, Trump was peppered with political questions. “Could you comment on the kind of feedback or what you took from the feedback from Mr. Cohen’s Iowa trip,” one reporter asked. “You could ask Mr. Cohen. You can speak to him,” Trump replied.', 'But she pressed. “Are you encouraged by anything that you saw or read out of that? Trump couldn’t resist. “Well,” he said, “I mean the response has been amazing, actually.”', 'Another response: A complaint was filed with the Federal Election Commission, alleging Trump had accepted “excessive or impermissible contributions from the Trump Organization, LLC” because shouldtrumprun.com was set up by an employee: Michael Cohen. Trump and Cohen were cleared of wrongdoing. One of the two commissioners who signed off on the ruling was Donald McGahn. McGahn later became Trump’s White House counsel.', 'There’s another piece of public work that Cohen was involved in that further shows the close links among Trump, Cohen, and the attorney David Schwartz. During the same time period of the Georgia deal and shouldtrumprun.com, Schwartz and Cohen were both working on a project called Trump on the Ocean, which aimed to construct a massive catering hall in the popular Jones Beach State Park on Long Island.', 'Trump was so keen on this project that, unusually even for him, he called four governors and a state comptroller to lobby for it, according to former state officials. In at least one of the calls, he cited his generous donations as a reason to get the clearances he needed to move forward.', 'Trump put Cohen in charge of the negotiations. But some state officials balked at what they saw as an attempt to commercialize a state park, and Trump’s insistence that the state override its fire code so he could build a kitchen in the basement.', 'The lobbying was contentious, said Judith Enck, the top environmental advisr for Govs. Eliot Spitzer and David Paterson (and later the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency for the New York region), who was involved in the negotiations. “That was not a typical discussion with a business that was trying to do business with the state of New York. It was aggressive,” Enck said. “There were efforts to go around me to get a better outcome in the discussion … I recall it as you know one of the most unpleasant experiences I had in the governor’s office.”', 'Misery, perhaps, for a government official — but triumph for Trump, Cohen and Schwartz. They got permission to begin construction. “GREAT JOB!” Trump wrote in a note to Schwartz. “I will hire your firm again!”', 'Alas, it was all for naught in the end. Months later, the tail of Superstorm Sandy inundated Jones Beach and Trump walked away from the project.', '________________________________________________________________________________________', 'Three years later, when Trump made a run for the White House, Cohen continued to serve both as promoter and dealmaker. He frequently appeared on TV as a Trump surrogate, though he had no official campaign position. In one interview in the summer of 2016, Cohen refused to acknowledge that polls strongly favored Hillary Clinton. He badgered CNN anchor Brianna Keilar when she referred to Trump’s then-dismal poll numbers. “Says who?” Cohen shot back. “What polls?” The anchor, seemingly mystified, answered, “All of them?” The clip went viral.', 'Cohen’s truculent tendencies were also on display a year before that interview when he threatened Daily Beast reporter Tim Mak. Mak had resurfaced an old accusation made by Donald Trump’s first wife, Ivana, during their divorce proceedings, that Trump had raped her. (She later withdrew the allegation.) “I’m warning you,” Mak says Cohen told him, “tread very f--king lightly because what I’m going to do to you is going to be f--king disgusting.”', 'Behind the scenes, Cohen was still attempting to make deals for Trump in the former Soviet Union. Cohen drafted a letter of intent with a Moscow investment company to build Trump World Tower Moscow.', 'Cohen’s partner in the deal was Felix Sater, a Trump associate who had been convicted of assault and securities fraud and had widely reported connections to the Russian mob. “Let’s make this happen and build a Trump Moscow,” Sater wrote in an email to Cohen. “And possibly fix relations between the countries by showing everyone commerce and business are much better and more practical than politics.”', 'In another email, Sater wrote, “Buddy our boy can become President of the USA and we can engineer it.” In a statement issued last summer, Cohen called this “puffery” and said Sater was prone to colorful language and salesmanship.', 'Cohen’s activities drew the attention of Christopher Steele, a former British spy who was assembling raw intelligence on the Trump campaign for a private client (ultimately paid for by the Clinton campaign). The resulting collection of documents has become known as “the dossier.”', 'Steele’s memo included the assertion that Cohen met with Russian contacts in Prague after damaging news emerged about Trump’s former campaign manager and an aide. “The overall objective had been ‘sweep it all under the carpet and make sure no connection could be fully established or proven,’” Steele wrote in a memo dated Oct. 19, 2016.', 'In statements and court documents, Cohen has vociferously denied ever visiting Prague, even dispensing photos of his passport, with no Czech stamps visible, as putative proof. Cohen has filed two defamation lawsuits over the release of the dossier. But now McClatchy has reported that special counsel Robert Mueller has evidence that Cohen was in Prague in late summer 2016. (And the photographic “proof” Cohen offered may turn out to be moot, according to the McClatchy article, since he reportedly entered the Czech Republic from Germany, which would not have required him to pass through immigration or customs.)', 'One thing that Cohen does not dispute: In October 2016, he was involved in fixing another problem, this time by paying $130,000 to porn star Stormy Daniels. Cohen asserts he did this on his own, with money he obtained from a home equity line of credit.', 'When FBI agents searched Cohen’s offices on April 9, 2018, they were seeking evidence relating to the Stormy Daniels payment. They were also, according to the Washington Post, sifting through business records relating to Cohen’s taxi medallions. There may still be answers to be found in Queens.', ' ']"

ProPublica estimates that in the past five years alone, IBM has eliminated more than 20,000 American employees ages 40 and over, about 60 percent of its estimated total U.S. job cuts during those years.', 'In making these cuts, IBM has flouted or outflanked U.S. laws and regulations intended to protect later-career workers from age discrimination, according to a ProPublica review of internal company documents, legal filings and public records, as well as information provided via interviews and questionnaires filled out by more than 1,000 former IBM employees.', 'Among ProPublica’s findings, IBM:', 'IBM declined requests for the numbers or age breakdown of its job cuts.

You can’t just disregard them.”', 'FOR MUCH OF ITS HISTORY, IBM viewed its fate and that of its predominantly U.S. workforce as inseparable. By the late 1960s, the company’s grip on the mainframe computer business had grown so great the Justice Department sued it for monopolizing the industry, a case that dragged on for years before being dropped as “without merit.” Such dominance convinced executives they could deliver extraordinary workplace stability in return for loyal service.', '“When recessions occur or there is a major product shift, some companies handle the resulting workforce imbalances by letting people go,” explained an  employee handbook of the 1980s. By contrast, IBM “retrains, reassigns and even relocates employees.”', 'For their part, continued the handbook, employees must be “flexible, willing to change, work overtime, and adapt to new situations quickly.” The logic behind the bargain was that “people are a treasured resource.” At IBM, “they are treated like one.”', 'But within a decade, IBM had stumbled not once but three times, in ways that would come to cost both the company and its workers. First, it failed to appreciate the “major product shift” behind a new chip technology that first entered people’s lives as the guts of pocket calculators and cheap digital watches and was making possible increasingly powerful and networked personal computers that undercut the company’s mainframe business. Second, it misjudged its employees’ reaction to switching to a kind of pension that no longer rewarded older, long-service workers. IBM workers responded with a lawsuit that forced the company to settle by paying more than $300 million and reinstating expensive traditional pensions for more than 100,000 of them.', 'And by the early years of the new century, IBM was falling behind again by failing to quickly devise innovative uses for the internet like its new rivals, Google, Facebook and Amazon. As it slipped, the company began having second thoughts about the price of unbending loyalty to its long-serving workforce.', 'In a little-noticed paper issued in 2006 by the London office of one of the company’s consulting arms, executives praised boomers’ experience, but described them as  “gray hairs” and “old heads.” While recognizing that older workers were important to high-tech employers such as IBM, it concluded that “successor generations … are generally much more innovative and receptive to technology than baby boomers.”', 'The paper was subsequently cited in an age discrimination lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Pennsylvania. Before the complaint was settled last year, the plaintiffs alleged in a filing: “IBM’s Boomer employees — being labeled by IBM’s own research as uncollaborative, skeptical of leadership, technologically unsophisticated, less innovative and generally out of touch with IBM’s brand, customers and objectives — were shown the door in droves.”', 'By the time IBM’s current CEO, Virginia “Ginni” Rometty, took over in 2012, the company had shifted its personnel focus to millennials.', 'Rometty launched a major overhaul that aimed to make IBM a major player in the emerging technologies of cloud services, big data analytics, mobile, security and social media, or what came to be known inside as CAMS.', 'At the same time, she sought to sharply increase hiring of people born after 1980.', '“CAMS are driven by Millennial Traits,” declared a slide presentation for an invitation-only IBM event in New York in December 2014. Not only were millennials in sync with the new technologies, but they were also attuned to the collaborative, consensus-driven modes of work these technologies demanded, company researchers said they’d discovered. Millennials “are not likely to make decisions in isolation,” the presentation said, but instead “depend on analytic technologies to help them.”', 'By contrast, people 50 or over are “more dubious” of analytics, “place less stock in the advantages data offers,” and are less “motivated to consult their colleagues or get their buy in … It’s Baby Boomers who are the outliers.”', 'The message was clear. To succeed at the new technologies, the company must, in the words of the presentation, “become one with the Millennial mindset.”  Similar language found its way into a variety of  IBM presentations in  subsequent years.', 'Even before the New York conference, IBM had begun a major effort to recruit millennial employees. It launched a blog, “The Millennial Experience,” and a hashtag on Twitter, #IBMillennial.” It began an online and print advertising campaign primarily featuring young people. It established a “Millennial Corps,” a network of more than 5,000 young IBMers whom Rometty and other top executives said they’d  regularly consult before making business decisions. And it sharply improved benefits, like parental leave, especially important to younger employees.', 'Its initiatives won IBM  plaudits from women’s groups; lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender organizations; human rights and disability associations; indeed advocates for just about every class of people protected under U.S. equal employment opportunity laws.', 'And the entire effort was guided by something that then-IBM brand strategist Bill Grady told the 2014 conference: “What’s good for Millennials is good for everyone.”', 'AS IBM TRAINED ITS SIGHTS on younger workers, it also took steps to change the way it dealt with those who’d spent many years on the job. It embraced a legal strategy that made it much easier for the company to dismiss older workers, and to do so in ways that minimized legal consequences and largely avoided public attention.', 'Until 2014, IBM had provided  two lists to workers getting laid off. One showed the positions and ages, but not the names, of all the people laid off from their business units at the same time. The other showed the positions and ages of all those staying on. For example, Madfis, the digital marketing strategist, got a list when she was let go in July 2013.', 'Such lists are common in corporate layoffs, thanks to a disclosure requirement added to the ADEA in 1990. The reason for the new rule was that virtually all employers had begun making severance pay and other parting benefits contingent on a laid-off worker signing away the right to sue the company. Congress wanted to make sure that before employees signed such waivers they understood enough to make “knowing and voluntary” decisions about whether they might have been targeted because of their age.', 'IBM complied with the disclosure requirement for more than two decades. As a result, even when the company stopped disclosing its U.S. employment totals — and thus its job cuts — the numbers still became known as employees collected and tallied the number of layoffs from lists provided to workers by various company units.', 'So after it ran into political flak for its workforce reductions, IBM decided to stop giving out the lists. When Diane Moos, 62, of Long Beach, California, lost her job as a systems security specialist in May 2016, she had no way of knowing how many people had been laid off with her, or their ages.', 'IBM spokesman Doug Shelton  said at the time the company was acting out of concern for its workers who had complained the disclosures “infringed on employee privacy” — even though the lists contained no names.', 'How did IBM get around the legal requirement for the disclosures? With a move that even critics acknowledge is ingenious.', 'The company’s pre-2014  layoff documents required employees receiving severance to waive all bias claims based on “race, national origin, ancestry, color, creed, religion, sex, sexual orientation, pregnancy, marital status, age … disability, medical condition, or veteran status.” The  new documents deleted “age” from the waiver list. In fact, they specifically said employees were not waiving their right when it came to age and could pursue age discrimination cases against the company.', 'But, the new documents added, employees had to waive the right to take their age cases to court. Instead, they had to pursue them through private arbitration. What’s more, they had to keep them confidential and pursue them alone. They couldn’t join with other workers to make a case.', 'With the new documents in place, IBM was no longer asking laid-off workers to sign away their right to complain about age bias so, the company’s lawyers told the EEOC, the disclosure requirement in the 1990 amendments to the age act no longer applied.', 'Critics say the company’s argument is hard to square with the statute’s clear requirements.', '“You have a law that says older workers being laid off need this information and employers are obligated to provide it. You have a company that’s not providing it,” said David Lopez, the former general counsel for the EEOC. “How can this not be undercutting the intent of the law?”', 'In their relationships with both workers and customers, American corporations are making increasingly heavy use of arbitration, contending the process is fair and saves all parties time and legal costs. The Supreme Court has repeatedly expanded the right of companies to require that disputes be settled by arbitrators rather than judges.', 'When it comes to employment claims, studies have found that arbitrators overwhelmingly favor employers.  Research by Cornell University law and labor relations specialist Alexander Colvin found that workers  win only 19 percent of the time when their cases are arbitrated. By contrast,  they win 36 percent of the time when they go to federal court, and 57 percent in state courts. Average payouts when an employee wins follow a similar pattern.', 'Given those odds, and having signed away their rights to go to court, some laid-off IBM workers have chosen the one independent forum companies can’t deny them: the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. That’s where Moos, the Long Beach systems security specialist, and several of her colleagues, turned for help when they were laid off. In their complaints to the agency, they said they’d suffered age discrimination because of the company’s effort to “drastically change the IBM employee age mix … to be seen as a startup.”', 'In its formal reply to the EEOC, IBM said that age couldn’t have been a factor in their dismissals. Among the reasons it cited: The managers who decided on the layoffs were in their 40s and therefore older too.', 'WHETHER IBM IS STAYING WITHIN U.S. age laws as it cuts from and adds to its workforce turns largely on how and why the company chooses individuals to be eliminated. While executives say they never target older workers, internal company documents and interviews suggest otherwise.', 'Consider, for example, a planning presentation that former IBM executives said was drafted by heads of a business unit carved out of IBM’s once-giant software group and charged with pursuing the “C,” or cloud, portion of the company’s CAMS strategy.', 'The presentation laid out plans for substantially altering the unit’s workforce. It was shown to company leaders including Diane Gherson, the senior vice president for human resources, and James Kavanaugh, recently elevated to chief financial officer. Its language was couched in the argot of “resources,” IBM’s term for employees, and “EP’s,” its shorthand for early professionals or recent college graduates.', 'Among the goals: “Shift headcount mix towards greater % of Early Professional hires.”', 'Among the means: ”[D]rive a more aggressive performance management approach to enable us to hire and replace where needed, and fund an influx of EPs to correct seniority mix.”', 'Among the expected results: ”[A] significant reduction in our workforce of 2,500 resources.”', 'A slide from a similar presentation prepared last spring for the same leaders called for “re-profiling current talent” to “create room for new talent.” Presentations for 2015 and 2016 for the 50,000-employee software group also included plans for “aggressive performance management” and emphasized the need to “maintain steady attrition to offset hiring.”', 'IBM declined to answer questions about whether either presentation was turned into company policy. The description of the planned moves matches what hundreds of older ex-employees told ProPublica they believe happened to them: They were ousted because of their age. The company used their exits to hire replacements, many of them young; to ship their work overseas; or to cut its overall headcount.', 'Ed Alpern, now 65, of Austin, started his 39-year run with IBM as a Selectric typewriter repairman. He ended as a project manager in October of 2016 when, he said, his manager told him he could either leave with severance and other parting benefits or be given a bad job review — something he said he’d never previously received — and risk being fired without them.', 'Albert Poggi, now 70, was a three-decade IBM veteran and ran the company’s Palisades, New York, technical center where clients can test new products. When notified in November of 2016 he was losing his job to layoff, he asked his bosses why, given what he said was a history of high job ratings. “They told me,” he said, “they needed to fill it with someone newer.”', 'The presentations from the software group, as well as the stories of ex-employees like Alpern and Poggi, square with internal documents from two other major IBM business units. The documents for all three cover some or all of the years from 2013 through the beginning of 2018 and deal with job assessments, hiring, firing and layoffs.', 'The documents detail practices that appear at odds with how IBM says it treats its employees. In many instances, the practices in effect, if not intent, tilt against the company’s older U.S. workers.', 'For example, IBM spokespeople and lawyers have said the company never considers a worker’s age in making decisions about layoffs or firings.', 'But one 2014 document reviewed by ProPublica includes dates of birth. An ex-IBM employee familiar with the process said executives from one business unit used it to decide about layoffs or other job changes for nearly a thousand workers, almost two-thirds of them over 50.', 'Documents from subsequent years show that young workers are protected from cuts for at least a limited period of time. A 2016 slide presentation prepared by the company’s global technology services unit, titled “U.S. Resource Action Process” and used to guide managers in layoff procedures, includes bullets for categories considered “ineligible” for layoff. Among them: “early professional hires,” meaning recent college graduates.', 'This slide, from an invitation-only IBM conference in New York in December 2014, suggests that the company’s future success in marketing emerging technologies depended on how well it understood and embraced the generation born after 1980.', 'In responding to age-discrimination complaints that ex-employees file with the EEOC, lawyers for IBM say that front-line managers make all decisions about who gets laid off, and that their decisions are based strictly on skills and job performance, not age.', 'But ProPublica reviewed spreadsheets that indicate front-line managers hardly acted alone in making layoff calls. Former IBM managers said the spreadsheets were prepared for upper-level executives and kept continuously updated. They list hundreds of employees together with codes like “lift and shift,” indicating that their jobs were to be lifted from them and shifted overseas, and details such as whether IBM’s clients had approved the change.', 'An examination of several of the spreadsheets suggests that, whatever the criteria for assembling them, the resulting list of those marked for layoff was skewed toward older workers. A 2016 spreadsheet listed more than 400 full-time U.S. employees under the heading “REBAL,” which refers to “rebalancing,” the process that can lead to laying off workers and either replacing them or shifting the jobs overseas. Using the job search site LinkedIn, ProPublica was able to locate about 100 of these employees and then obtain their ages through public records. Ninety percent of those found were 40 or older. Seventy percent were over 50.', 'IBM frequently cites its history of encouraging diversity in its responses to EEOC complaints about age discrimination. “IBM has been a leader in taking positive actions to ensure its business opportunities are made available to individuals without regard to age, race, color, gender, sexual orientation and other categories,” a lawyer for the company wrote in a May 2017 letter. “This policy of non-discrimination is reflected in all IBM business activities.”', 'But ProPublica found at least one company business unit using a point system that disadvantaged older workers. The system awarded points for attributes valued by the company. The more points a person garnered, according to the former employee, the more protected she or he was from layoff or other negative job change; the fewer points, the more vulnerable.', 'The arrangement appears on its face to favor younger newcomers over older veterans. Employees were awarded points for being relatively new at a job level or in a particular role. Those who worked for IBM for fewer years got more points than those who’d been there a long time.', 'The ex-employee familiar with the process said a 2014 spreadsheet from that business unit, labeled “IBM Confidential,” was assembled to assess the job prospects of more than 600 high-level employees, two-thirds of them from the U.S. It included employees’ years of service with IBM, which the former employee said was used internally as a proxy for age. Also listed was an assessment by their bosses of their career trajectories as measured by the highest job level they were likely to attain if they remained at the company, as well as their point scores.', 'The tilt against older workers is evident when employees’ years of service are compared with their point scores. Those with no points and therefore most vulnerable to layoff had worked at IBM an average of more than 30 years; those with a high number of points averaged half that.', 'Perhaps even more striking is the comparison between employees’ service years and point scores on the one hand and their superiors’ assessments of their career trajectories on the other.', 'Along with many American employers, IBM has argued it needs to shed older workers because they’re no longer at the top of their games or lack “contemporary” skills.', 'But among those sized up in the confidential spreadsheet, fully 80 percent of older employees — those with the most years of service but no points and therefore most vulnerable to layoff — were rated by superiors as good enough to stay at their current job levels or be promoted. By contrast, only a small percentage of younger employees with a high number of points were similarly rated.', '“No major company would use tools to conduct a layoff where a disproportionate share of those let go were African Americans or women,” said Cathy Ventrell-Monsees, senior attorney adviser with the EEOC and former director of age litigation for the senior lobbying giant AARP. “There’s no difference if the tools result in a disproportionate share being older workers.”', 'In addition to the point system that disadvantaged older workers in layoffs, other documents suggest that IBM has made increasingly aggressive use of its job-rating machinery to pave the way for straight-out firings, or what the company calls “management-initiated separations.” Internal documents suggest that older workers were especially targets.', 'Like in many companies, IBM employees sit down with their managers at the start of each year and set goals for themselves. IBM graded on a scale of 1 to 4, with 1 being top-ranked.', 'Those rated as 3 or 4 were given formal short-term goals known as personal improvement plans, or PIPs. Historically many managers were lenient, especially toward those with 3s whose ratings had dropped because of forces beyond their control, such as a weakness in the overall economy, ex-employees said.', 'But within the past couple of years, IBM appears to have decided the time for leniency was over. For example, a software group planning document for 2015 said that, over and above layoffs, the unit should seek to fire about 3,000 of the unit’s 50,000-plus workers.', 'To make such deep cuts, the document said, executives should strike an “aggressive performance management posture.” They needed to double the share of employees given low 3 and 4 ratings to at least 6.6 percent of the division’s workforce. And because layoffs cost the company more than outright dismissals or resignations, the document said, executives should make sure that more than 80 percent of those with low ratings get fired or forced to quit.', 'Finally, the 2015 document said the division should work “to attract the best and brightest early professionals” to replace up to two-thirds of those sent packing. A more recent planning document — the presentation to top executives Gherson and Kavanaugh for a business unit carved out of the software group — recommended using similar techniques to free up money by cutting current employees to fund an “influx” of young workers.', 'In a recent interview, Poggi said he was resigned to being laid off. “Everybody at IBM has a bullet with their name on it,” he said. Alpern wasn’t nearly as accepting of being threatened with a poor job rating and then fired.', 'Alpern had a particular reason for wanting to stay on at IBM, at least until the end of last year. His younger son, Justin, then a high school senior, had been named a National Merit semifinalist. Alpern wanted him to be able to apply for one of the company’s Watson scholarships. But IBM had recently narrowed eligibility so only the children of current employees could apply, not also retirees as it was until 2014.', 'Alpern had to make it through December for his son to be eligible.', 'But in August, he said, his manager ordered him to retire. He sought to buy time by appealing to superiors. But he said the manager’s response was to threaten him with a bad job review that, he was told, would land him on a PIP, where his work would be scrutinized weekly. If he failed to hit his targets — and his managers would be the judges of that — he’d be fired and lose his benefits.', 'Alpern couldn’t risk it; he retired on Oct. 31. His son, now a freshman on the dean’s list at Texas A&M University, didn’t get to apply.', '“I can think of only a couple regrets or disappointments over my 39 years at IBM,”″ he said, “and that’s one of them.”', 'LIKE ANY COMPANY IN THE U.S., IBM faces few legal constraints to reducing the size of its workforce. And with its no-disclosure strategy, it eliminated one of the last regular sources of information about its employment practices and the changing size of its American workforce.', 'But there remained the question of whether recent cutbacks were big enough to trigger state and federal requirements for disclosure of layoffs. And internal documents, such as a slide in a 2016 presentation titled “Transforming to Next Generation Digital Talent,” suggest executives worried that “winning the talent war” for new young workers required IBM to improve the “attractiveness of (its) culture and work environment,” a tall order in the face of layoffs and firings.', 'So the company apparently has sought to put a softer face on its cutbacks by recasting many as voluntary rather than the result of decisions by the firm. One way it has done this is by converting many layoffs to retirements.', 'Some ex-employees told ProPublica that, faced with a layoff notice, they were just as happy to retire. Others said they felt forced to accept a retirement package and leave. Several actively objected to the company treating their ouster as a retirement. The company nevertheless processed their exits as such.', 'Project manager Ed Alpern’s departure was treated in company paperwork as a voluntary retirement. He didn’t see it that way, because the alternative he said he was offered was being fired outright.', 'Lorilynn King, a 55-year-old IT specialist who worked from her home in Loveland, Colorado, had been with IBM almost as long as Alpern by May 2016 when her manager called to tell her the company was conducting a layoff and her name was on the list.', 'King said the manager told her to report to a meeting in Building 1 on IBM’s Boulder campus the following day. There, she said, she found herself in a group of other older employees being told by an IBM human resources representative that they’d all be retiring. “I have NO intention of retiring,” she remembers responding. “I’m being laid off.”', 'ProPublica has collected documents from 15 ex-IBM employees who got layoff notices followed by a retirement package and has talked with many others who said they received similar paperwork. Critics say the sequence doesn’t square well with the law.', '“This country has banned mandatory retirement,” said Seiner, the University of South Carolina law professor and former EEOC appellate lawyer. “The law says taking a retirement package has to be voluntary. If you tell somebody ‘Retire or we’ll lay you off or fire you,’ that’s not voluntary.”', 'Until recently, the company’s retirement paperwork included a letter from Rometty, the CEO, that read, in part, “I wanted to take this opportunity to wish you well on your retirement … While you may be retiring to embark on the next phase of your personal journey, you will always remain a valued and appreciated member of the IBM family.” Ex-employees said IBM stopped sending the letter last year.', 'IBM has also embraced another practice that leads workers, especially older ones, to quit on what appears to be a voluntary basis. It substantially reversed its pioneering support for telecommuting, telling people who’ve been working from home for years to begin reporting to certain, often distant, offices. Their other choice: Resign.', 'David Harlan had worked as an IBM marketing strategist from his home in Moscow, Idaho, for 15 years when a manager told him last year of orders to reduce the performance ratings of everybody at his pay grade. Then in February last year, when he was 50, came an internal video from IBM’s new senior vice president, Michelle Peluso, which announced plans to improve the work of marketing employees by ordering them to work “shoulder to shoulder.” Those who wanted to stay on would need to “co-locate” to offices in one of six cities.', 'Early last year, Harlan received an email congratulating him on “the opportunity to join your team in Raleigh, North Carolina.” He had 30 days to decide on the 2,600-mile move. He resigned in June.', 'After the Peluso video was leaked to the press, an IBM spokeswoman told the Wall Street Journal that the “vast majority” of people ordered to change locations and begin reporting to offices did so. IBM Vice President Ed Barbini said in an initial email exchange with ProPublica in July that the new policy affected only about 2,000 U.S. employees and that “most” of those had agreed to move.', 'But employees across a wide range of company operations, from the systems and technology group to analytics, told ProPublica they’ve also been ordered to co-locate in recent years. Many IBMers with long service said that they quit rather than sell their homes, pull children from school and desert aging parents. IBM declined to say how many older employees were swept up in the co-location initiative.', '“They basically knew older employees weren’t going to do it,” said Eileen Maroney, a 63-year-old IBM product manager from Aegean, South Carolina, who, like Harlan, was ordered to move to Raleigh or resign. “Older people aren’t going to move. It just doesn’t make any sense.” Like Harlan, Maroney left IBM last June.', 'Having people quit rather than being laid off may help IBM avoid disclosing how much it is shrinking its U.S. workforce and where the reductions are occurring.', 'Under the federal WARN Act, adopted in the wake of huge job cuts and factory shutdowns during the 1980s, companies laying off 50 or more employees who constitute at least one-third of an employer’s workforce at a site have to give advance notice of layoffs to the workers, public agencies and local elected officials.', 'Similar laws in some states where IBM has a substantial presence are even stricter. California, for example, requires advanced notice for layoffs of 50 or more employees, no matter what the share of the workforce. New York requires notice for 25 employees who make up a third.', 'Because the laws were drafted to deal with abrupt job cuts at individual plants, they can miss reductions that occur over long periods among a workforce like IBM’s that was, at least until recently, widely dispersed because of the company’s work-from-home policy.', 'IBM’s training sessions to prepare managers for layoffs suggest the company was aware of WARN thresholds, especially in states with strict notification laws such as California. A 2016 document entitled “Employee Separation Processing” and labeled “IBM Confidential” cautions managers about the “unique steps that must be taken when processing separations for California employees.”', 'A ProPublica review of five years of WARN disclosures for a dozen states where the company had large facilities that shed workers found no disclosures in nine. In the other three, the company alerted authorities of just under 1,000 job cuts — 380 in California, 369 in New York and 200 in Minnesota. IBM’s reported figures are well below the actual number of jobs the company eliminated in these states, where in recent years it has shuttered, sold off or leveled plants that once employed vast numbers.', 'By contrast, other employers in the same 12 states reported layoffs last year alone totaling 215,000 people. They ranged from giant Walmart to Ostrom’s Mushroom Farms in Washington state.', 'Whether IBM operated within the rules of the WARN act, which are notoriously fungible, could not be determined because the company declined to provide ProPublica with details on its layoffs.', 'WITH 35 YEARS AT IBM under his belt, Ed Miyoshi had plenty of experience being pushed to take buyouts, or early retirement packages, and refusing them. But he hadn’t expected to be pushed last fall.', 'Miyoshi, of Hopewell Junction, New York, had some years earlier launched a pilot program to improve IBM’s technical troubleshooting. With the blessing of an IBM vice president, he was busily interviewing applicants in India and Brazil to staff teams to roll the program out to clients worldwide.', 'The interviews may have been why IBM mistakenly assumed Miyoshi was a manager, and so emailed him to eliminate the one U.S.-based employee still left in his group.', '“That was me,” Miyoshi realized.', 'In his sign-off email to colleagues shortly before Christmas 2016, Miyoshi, then 57, wrote: “I am too young and too poor to stop working yet, so while this is good-bye to my IBM career, I fully expect to cross paths with some of you very near in the future.”', 'He did, and perhaps sooner than his colleagues had expected; he started as a subcontractor to IBM about two weeks later, on Jan. 3.', 'Miyoshi is an example of older workers who’ve lost their regular IBM jobs and been brought back as contractors. Some of them — not Miyoshi — became contract workers after IBM told them their skills were out of date and no longer needed.', 'Employment law experts said that hiring ex-employees as contractors can be legally dicey. It raises the possibility that the layoff of the employee was not for the stated reason but perhaps because they were targeted for their age, race or gender.', 'IBM appears to recognize the problem. Ex-employees say the company has repeatedly told managers — most recently earlier this year — not to contract with former employees or sign on with third-party contracting firms staffed by ex-IBMers. But ProPublica turned up dozens of instances where the company did just that.', 'Responding to a question in a confidential questionnaire from ProPublica, one 35-year company veteran from New York said he knew exactly what happened to the job he left behind when he was laid off. “I’M STILL DOING IT. I got a new gig eight days after departure, working for a third-party company under contract to IBM doing the exact same thing.”', 'In many cases, of course, ex-employees are happy to have another job, even if it is connected with the company that laid them off.', 'Henry, the Columbus-based sales and technical specialist who’d been with IBM’s “resiliency services” unit, discovered that he’d lost his regular IBM job because the company had purchased an Indian firm that provided the same services. But after a year out of work, he wasn’t going to turn down the offer of a temporary position as a subcontractor for IBM, relocating data centers. It got money flowing back into his household and got him back where he liked to be, on the road traveling for business.', 'The compensation most ex-IBM employees make as contractors isn’t comparable. While Henry said he collected the same dollar amount, it didn’t include health insurance, which cost him $1,325 a month. Miyoshi said his paycheck is 20 percent less than what he made as an IBM regular.', '“I took an over $20,000 hit by becoming a contractor. I’m not a millionaire, so that’s a lot of money to me,” Miyoshi said.', 'And lower pay isn’t the only problem ex-IBM employees-now-subcontractors face. This year, Miyoshi’s payable hours have been cut by an extra 10 “furlough days.” Internal documents show that IBM repeatedly furloughs subcontractors without pay, often for two, three or more weeks a quarter. In some instances, the furloughs occur with little advance notice and at financially difficult moments. In one document, for example, it appears IBM managers, trying to cope with a cost overrun spotted in mid-November, planned to dump dozens of subcontractors through the end of the year, the middle of the holiday season.', 'Former IBM employees now on contract said the company controls costs by notifying contractors in the midst of projects they have to take pay cuts or lose the work. Miyoshi said that he originally started working for his third-party contracting firm for 10 percent less than at IBM, but ended up with an additional 10 percent cut in the middle of 2017, when IBM notified the contractor it was slashing what it would pay.', 'For many ex-employees, there are few ways out. Henry, for example, sought to improve his chances of landing a new full-time job by seeking assistance to finish a college degree through a federal program designed to retrain workers hurt by offshoring of jobs.', 'But when he contacted the Ohio state agency that administers the Trade Adjustment Assistance, or TAA, program, which provides assistance to workers who lose their jobs for trade-related reasons, he was told IBM hadn’t submitted necessary paperwork. State officials said Henry could apply if he could find other IBM employees who were laid off with him, information that the company doesn’t provide.', 'TAA is overseen by the Labor Department but is operated by states under individual agreements with Washington, so the rules can vary from state to state. But generally employers, unions, state agencies and groups of employers can petition for training help and cash assistance. Labor Department data compiled by the advocacy group Global Trade Watch shows that employers apply in about 40 percent of cases. Some groups of IBM workers have obtained retraining funds when they or their state have applied, but records dating back to the early 1990s show IBM itself has applied for and won taxpayer assistance only once, in 2008, for three Chicago-area workers whose jobs were being moved to India.', 'AS IBM ELIMINATED THOUSANDS of jobs in 2016, David Carroll, a 52-year-old Austin software engineer, thought he was safe.', 'His job was in mobile development, the “M” in the company’s CAMS strategy.

Combined with the company’s increasingly frequent request that departing employees train their overseas replacements, it has left many people bitter. Scores of ex-employees interviewed by ProPublica said that managers with job openings told them they weren’t allowed to hire from layoff lists without getting prior, high-level clearance, something that’s almost never given.', 'ProPublica reviewed documents that show that a substantial share of recent IBM layoffs have involved what the company calls “lift and shift,” lifting the work of specific U.S. employees and shifting it to specific workers in countries such as India and Brazil. For example, a document summarizing U.S. employment in part of the company’s global technology services division for 2015 lists nearly a thousand people as layoff candidates, with the jobs of almost half coded for lift and shift.', 'Ex-employees interviewed by ProPublica said the lift-and-shift process required their extensive involvement.

15,Sony prepares to unveil two new PlayStation 4 models,2016-09-06T16:04:42+0000,"['Even in an industry where leaks are commonplace, the relatively slight flow of  information about Sony’s PlayStation event, scheduled for Wednesday, has been remarkable. ', 'The video game giant is expected to reveal details on a new pair of systems: “Neo,” a high-end version  of the console that the company confirmed it was working on in  June, and a still-unannounced slimmed-down version of the  existing PS4. ', 'Both are notable for different reasons. Neo is the next iteration  of the PlayStation brand, just as Microsoft’s Scorpio is the next  step for the Xbox. (As the gaming world has evolved, the  definition of “next generation” systems is changing. Rather than  hitting reset and launching entirely new consoles, both companies  are offering systems that play all existing PS4 and Xbox One  games, but greatly enhance the hardware power.) ', 'The PS4 Slim was supposed to be a surprise, but word began  slipping out weeks ago — followed by an unboxing video and even a  review, despite Sony refusing to officially acknowledge the  console’s existence. ', 'If anything, though, the buzz factor surrounding those leaks  could increase demand for the new form factor. Sony has held a  commanding lead over Xbox in this console generation. And a  slim-lined PS4 could counter hardware momentum Microsoft was  building with the Xbox One S, the smaller version of the company’s current flagship system, that began shipping last month. ', 'But, ultimately, Neo is likely to be the bigger story. ', 'The high-end system, which will sell alongside the PS4 Slim (and  the existing model, assuming that’s not phased out by the Slim),  will carry a higher price tag and is designed to appeal to hard-core gamers. It will have greater support for 4K TVs — allowing  for greatly enhanced graphics. And the more powerful internal  components are expected to make experiences in the upcoming  PlayStation VR smoother. (The PS4 Slim is also expected to be  compatible with PlayStation VR, it’s worth noting.) ', 'Those core gamers will be interested in learning more about the  system’s specs. Microsoft’s high-end system due to release in  holiday 2017, code-named Project Scorpio, unveiled a laundry list  of impressive processing power in June, including eight CPU cores  and six teraflops of GPU power. ', '  “We believe it will be the most powerful console ever built,”  said Phil Spencer, head of Microsoft’s Xbox division, during the  introduction. ', '  Just as critical will be price and release date. Neo is expected  to carry a premium of at least $100 over existing PS4 consoles,  though it could be more. And while it might make sense to offer a  high-end system head to head against Microsoft, the upcoming  October release of PlayStation VR could accelerate Neo’s launch.  (Analyst Ben Schachter of Macquarie Securities says he expects  Neo to go on sale later this year.)', '  Those questions will likely be answered with some finality  Wednesday. But Andrew House, president and group CEO of Sony  Interactive Entertainment told CNBC.com in June that he felt it  was critical that the PS4 user base (which numbers more than 40  million) not feel rushed to buy an upgraded model. ', '  “People invest in a console and they want to have that investment  validated over a decent period of time,” he said. “That being  said, with iterations like Neo we are, to some degree as an  industry, acknowledging the pace of iteration has shifted. …  People have become attuned to a slightly different cadence of  innovation. The critical thing is to give the consumer options,  rather than dictate the future for them.” ']"

Along with surging output from the U.S., rising production in Canada, Brazil and Norway will be able to meet higher demand through 2020, the energy policy adviser said.', 'Beyond that, however, the IEA warned that oil supply could become tight unless investment in new production rebounds from historic declines in recent years.', '“Upstream investment shows little sign of recovering from its plunge in 2015-2016, which raises concerns about whether adequate supply will be available to offset natural field declines and meet robust demand growth after 2020,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol wrote.', 'The industry’s investments fell by 25 percent in both 2015 and 2016 and were flat last year, according to IEA. Those declines dovetailed with an historic collapse in oil prices that saw benchmark crude futures fall from more than $100 a barrel in 2014 to below $30 in 2016.', 'The market has rebounded since the 14-member OPEC cartel partnered with Russia and other producer nations to cut output last year.', 'Birol said oil market conditions have changed substantially since then, and the most notable development is the resurgence of U.S. production. The surge in American output is underpinned by several major shale fields, where drillers use advanced technology to squeeze oil and natural gas from rock formations.', 'The IEA projects the United States will pump 17 million barrels a day of crude oil, condensates and natural gas liquids, easily defending its title as the world’s top producer of petroleum products. That’s up from 13.2 million barrels a day in 2017.', 'By comparison, OPEC will increase its capacity by just 750,000 barrels a day through 2023, IEA says.', 'Throughout the world, IEA sees oil production capacity rising by 6.4 million barrels a day to reach 107 million barrels a day. The United States will account for 60 percent of that global increase, the agency stated.', 'Meanwhile, demand for oil will jump by 6.9 million barrels a day to 104.7 million barrels a day during the same period, the IEA forecast. About half of that growth is projected to come from China and India.', 'The agency maintained that there’s no peak to oil demand in sight, but growth will start slowing down to about 1 million barrels a day by 2023.', 'Some of the headwinds include rising fuel efficiency in the United States, adoption of electric buses and natural-gas fueled trucks in China, and purchases of battery-powered passenger cars.', 'The biggest tailwind will come from the petrochemicals industry, which in the IEA’s view will account for a quarter of oil demand growth over the five-year period.', 'Oil and gas drilling yields byproducts like ethane and naphtha, which are used to make plastics and chemicals. These will be in high demand as more countries around the world approach middle class status, the agency added.  The United States is positioned to take advantage of this trend, as booming oil and natural gas production creates a low-cost supply of petrochemical feedstocks.', 'Additionally, American drillers are poised to play a bigger role in the export market. The country has shipped as much as 2 million barrels a day in recent weeks, and the IEA said it will be prepared to ship as much as 5 million barrels a day by 2023, after building out new pipelines and export terminals.', 'During the next five years, the United States will surrender the title of the world’s biggest oil importer to China and India, the agency estimated. In Asia, where some nations like China are refining more crude oil into gasoline at home, oil imports are expected to grow by 3.5 million barrels a day through 2023.', 'The Middle East will remain Asia’s biggest supplier, but the region is also ramping up its domestic refinery activity, so there’s opportunity for the United States to export more oil to the world’s biggest demand center, according to the agency. Growing petrochemical production in China will also open a pathway for U.S. oil shipments.']"

However, with mounting geopolitical issues, political uncertainty in the United States and rising interest rates around the globe, this year could see many more ups and downs.', 'What could impact markets in 2018? Here are six issues that investors should be paying attention to as they invest in the months ahead.', 'For the last several years, central banks around the world have engaged in quantitative easing, interest-rate reductions and a general loosening of monetary policy. That’s already reversing in the United States, which raised its overnight rate three times in 2017, to between 1.25 percent and 1.5 percent, but in other developed nations rates remain at ultralow levels. For instance, Sweden still has a negative interest rate of minus 0.5 percent.', 'That’s likely to change in 2018, says Jeff Knight, Columbia Threadneedle Investments’ global head of investment solutions and co-head of global asset allocation. Many people expect the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates at some point in 2018, while Bank of England may raise its rate, too. “Other central banks are a year or two behind the Fed in the cycle,” he says.', 'More from Global Investing Hot Spots:Chinese private fund assets hit $1.63 trillionVanguard warns on stock returns Surging Japanese ETFs', 'While rate rises can be a sign of economic strength, having too many hikes too quickly could send markets into a tailspin. Knight will be keeping a close eye on long-term government bond yields and whether the yields on those instruments invert, meaning they fall below short-term bond yields. That would happen if investors believed that monetary policy was becoming too tight. As of now, the 30-year U.S. government bond has a 2.9 percent yield, while the 5-year U.S. government bond has a 2.4 percent yield.', '“If investors believe there’s a deflation risk with tightening or that it will choke off economic growth, then we could see that inverted yield curve,” he says. “Too much tightening could become a growth headwind. It’s what happened in 2006 at the end of a long series of Fed rate hikes.”', 'North Korea may now be sending athletes to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, but the threat of war with America remains. While global stock markets haven’t reacted much to a potential nuclear fallout, conflict continues to be a risk, says Tim Courtney, chief investment officer at Exencial Wealth Advisors, an Oklahoma City-based financial advisory firm.', 'While he doesn’t think the two countries will come to blows, it’s impossible to predict just what Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump will do or say next. If something changes, such as a more threatening missile test from North Korea, then markets could react. And if stocks do fall, then investors should be concerned.', '“The market thinks that war with North Korea is not going to happen,” says Courtney. “But if we saw an announcement or test that did move the market, then I would look at that and say someone knows something and it doesn’t look good.”', 'Will Trump scrap NAFTA? Will he engage in a trade war with China? Those are the questions many investors are likely wondering, and as with most things Trump, it’s difficult to know whether his antitrade Tweets and talks are genuine or if they’re a negotiating tactic.', 'If Trump does start a trade war with other countries, then investors should watch out. On Jan. 11 Canada filed a trade complaint with the World Trade Organization over its and America’s ongoing softwood lumber issues — a move that could ratchet-up trade-related tensions. And while Trump did tell the Wall Street Journal that same day that NAFTA is not yet off the table, exiting from the deal is still a possibility.', 'If that happens, North American stocks will likely tumble, especially among the sectors that NAFTA impacts most, like agriculture and autos, says Mandana Hormozi, a portfolio manager with Franklin Mutual Series. “Will there be an effect on these three countries? Yes,” she says. “Probably more around the sectors and economies that have some effect on the border countries.”', 'The real risk, which is more of a long-term issue, is if the United States becomes more isolationist and lets China dictate the terms of global trade. “China is stepping into the void left by the U.S., and it’s ratcheting up its efforts to write trade deals with other countries,” says Kim Catechis, head of global emerging markets for Edinburgh-based investment firm Martin Currie.', 'At the same time, this could lead Beijing to severely contain American corporate interests in China, if not close off the market altogether.

The  co-founder and CEO of San Francisco-based Empowerkit, a service  that creates and manages websites for franchisors and  franchisees, says that while many national brands have adopted  his system, convincing the franchise community to try something  new is challenging because of the often lengthy vetting process  for vendors. Additionally, he says, decades-long contracts mean  that some vendors may be delivering systems that are years out of  date. ', '  “Many franchise brands have paralysis when it comes to  technology,” Safabakhsh says. “They think, If I don’t do  anything, I’ll be safe.”', '  That don’t-rock-the-boat strategy is no longer acceptable.  Innovations like fleet-management apps, improved customer-loyalty  programs and even digital signboards are already  transforming the franchise world. And the operational  streamlining provided by cloud-based tools and new restaurant  technologies, as well as efficiencies in training and back-end  operations like customer retention and billing, are creating two  classes of franchise systems: those that are getting a bump from  tech adoption, and those that will soon feel the pain from  waiting too long.

(This happens more  often than you’d think.) ', '  Traditionally, hosts and hostesses estimate wait times  for customers, adding an extra 15 or 20 minutes to make sure  they don’t disappoint. Long waits and crowded entry areas  mean customers might simply walk away and go elsewhere. But  NoWait, which allows the staff to coordinate and give  customers accurate wait times and text them when their table  is ready, frees up patrons to head to the bar or take a walk  before dinner. The app also lets diners put their name on the  waiting list from a mobile phone so they can show up exactly  when their table is ready—a valuable timesaver for busy  professionals and parents of small children. ', '  NoWait CEO Ware Sykes says the app—which he claims is used  to seat more than 5 million people per month—has been  embraced by Buffalo Wild Wings, Chili’s, First Watch and other  chains. He says it has helped restaurants see at least a 15  percent bump in sales because they can efficiently move more  customers in and out the door.', '  In fact, Sykes adds, franchisees are leading the way in embracing  the easy-to-implement system. “We’ve had franchisees adopt our  system faster than franchisors,” he says. “A lot of them are able  to make decisions at a store level. That’s how we got involved  with Texas Roadhouse. They saw franchisees using the tech at  their restaurants. It doesn’t have to integrate with legacy  systems; it’s just replacing pen and paper. After folks see  how much smoother their seating is and the increase in sales, it  really is something that is adopted quickly.”', '  Innovations in POS systems—traditionally among the most  complicated and expensive investments for franchisees—are  also gaining traction. The full-function POS app Lavu has been  adopted by small franchises and regional chains, but deals with  bigger players are in the works, according to Ben Harrison, vice  president of brand and creative at the Albuquerque, N.M.-based  company. “Now that we’ve cut our teeth, we can take a leap  forward into big enterprises,” he says. “We’re excited to move  forward with franchises and chains.”', '  The advantage of a cloud-based POS system is the ability to  generate finely detailed data, as well as cost savings. Harrison  notes that because updates are free, users can save 50 to 75  percent on customization and service. The system also recently  rolled out a new suite of reporting tools. ', '  “Franchises are really looking for granular information,” says  Lavu vice president of product development Alex Gibbs. “Some of  them have a ketchup gun where they can dial in the amount to  a tenth of an ounce. Knowing that type of thing is important to  them.” At the corporate level, he adds, “franchises are going to  want to be able to drill down into sales information for regions  and individual locations. I absolutely think people are moving  toward these kinds of real-time tech solutions.”', '  Harrison points out that the app-based system makes it easy to  integrate new features that would require huge upgrades for  traditional POS systems.

He points out that since  most people communicate and essentially manage their lives  through their mobile devices, it makes sense to run their  businesses from them, too. His tech company, Netsolace, which he  founded after Edible, has kept the franchise as forward-looking  as possible, developing mobile apps such as FranSupport Mobile,  which lets Edible communicate and deliver training modules to  franchisees; Franview, which lets field managers audit stores  with the home office and franchisees in real time; and Pulse, a  real-time communications system that lets franchisees and  corporate stay in touch. Netsolace is also promoting nXstep,  which broadcasts training tips, best practices, efficiencies and  company news.', '  “When I was a kid and worked at McDonald’s, they’d sit you down  in front of a TV and play a tape showing you how to make the  food,” Farid notes. “Now we do that in real time. Before, we used  to laminate training cards, and by the time we sent them, they  were out of date and cost $25,000 to $30,000. Now we can update  our videos or slides instantly, so it’s fresh. When a new  employee goes through our training modules, they’re completely up  to date.”  ', '  These are just a few of the innovations already transforming the  franchise world.

It will  fit snugly onto the payload of a rocket and then, once deployed,  Zamka said it will expand in less than five minutes to “the size  of a medium travel trailer.”  ', '  NASA wants to dock the BEAM to one of its ports and watch what  happens. “What we’ll be interested in is how it expands,” said  Bill Gerstenmaier, who heads up NASA’s human space exploration  program. “Does it expand in a longitudinal direction? Does it  expand in a circumferential direction? As it expands, does it  impart any loads back into the space station? We’ll be looking at  that to see if those things are concerns.”', 'Bigelow has successfully tested the inflatable habitat technology  with two self-funded launches, but docking  with the space station will be different. “This is not a free  flyer,” he said. “This spacecraft is attaching to a $100 billion  machine.”', '  Once the BEAM inflates, space station astronauts will test it  over two years for things like leaks, radiation levels, and  acoustics. If they want to go inside, they will have to pump in  air first, but BEAM may turn out to be an attractive getaway. ', 'The “station is quite noisy,” said Bigelow. Gerstenmaier added: “It  may become a very popular place for crews.” ', 'Another question is how durable and safe Bigelow’s expandable  structure will be over the long term. “The debris protection actually is sturdier than  what’s on the space station,” said Zamka. “It’s actually like a  steel-belted tire, except for the material that’s in there is  stronger than steel.” ', '  Bigelow said tests indicate that if the BEAM’s skin is penetrated  by debris, the leak would grow slowly. “The crew has a tremendous  amount of time to provide a patch for that,” he said. “These  systems are extremely reliable, the safest thing that mankind  could be in today by far.” ', 'Read More  Google, SpaceX to join forces: Report', '  BEAM is just the beginning for Bigelow. The company plans to build two larger habitats to be ready for commercial  liftoffs by 2017, even though there are currently no private  space taxis ready and no customers lined up. ', '“I think it’s an  acceptable risk to create that investment, which is going to be  substantial, to build these two spacecraft to ship out of here by  the end of ’17,” Bigelow said. By then, both SpaceX and Boeing may have private  transportation ready. ', '  Bigelow hopes to have habitats going to the moon in about a  decade, providing structures for commercial mining operations or  research. He’s working with the Federal Aviation Administration to develop policies that will grant some sort of property rights to companies that risk lives and treasure to get to the moon. ', '  Why the FAA? That agency issues launch licenses, and in the  future, Bigelow said the FAA is planning to restrict licenses so  that one American company is blocked from planning a trip to the exact spot on  the moon where another U.S. venture has already set up shop.  Whether other countries will respect such private commercial  claims remains to be seen. ', 'Read More  SpaceX, Elon Musk and the reusable rocket dream', '  A lot still needs to be worked out. “The next step is probably,  ‘What is this boundary where you are sufficiently safe?‘” Bigelow  asked. “What is this standoff distance?’” He thinks a buffer zone  on the moon between commercial neighbors may have to be greater than 100  miles. “I think it has to be a fair distance.”', '  As for astronaut Zamka, it’s been a change moving from  NASA to a small private venture. But he’s enjoying himself. “I was in the Marines, and one  of the things I liked about being in the Marines is there’s not  that many of us, so when there’s not that many of you, you get to  do more things,” he said.', 'While the private sector isn’t currently giving him astronomical pay, he sees astronomical potential, and the  chance to return to space, this time as a commercial astronaut.  “We’re doing tremendously interesting stuff,” said Zamka, “and I  get to be more directly involved with more parts of that.”']"

Or a gradual, gently sweeping arc in that direction?', 'Key questions, when you’re looking at what shape or form Rodrigo  Duterte’s new government is going to take in the Philippines,  are, What exactly does the “revolutionary government” he’s  promised actually mean? How “red” is it going to be?', 'Duterte’s acknowledged he’s going to be his country’s first  leftist president. But he says he’s not a communist, describing  himself as left-leaning, rather than card-carrying. Let’s say  socialist then.', 'What about his government though, when you consider he’s promised  to bring Jose Maria Sison back from a 30-year exile and install  him in the new cabinet? Duterte’s planning to go to The Hague for  talks with Sison soon. They’ve already conferenced over  Skype. ', 'Sison, known colloquially as “Joma,” is the founder of the  Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), and Duterte’s  intellectual inspiration. Sison taught a young Duterte at the  Lyceum in Manila in the ’70′s. Marcos jailed Sison for nearly a  decade for subversion. ', 'After the dictator fell, Sison was  released. Shortly after, while travelling in the Netherlands, the  Philippines revoked his passport. He’s been stateless since, and  continues to live in the Netherlands. He’s been seeking asylum  there as a political refugee since 1987.', 'The United States has classified him as a terrorist since 2002.  Similarly, the EU. But the Philippines dropped subversion  charges, so he’s not wanted by Manila. ', '  The CPP distances itself from Sison, claiming he’s just an  advisor and consultant now. But the Philippine military continues  to view him, as well as the CPP’s military wing, the New People’s  Army (NPA), as a threat.  ', 'Sison was charged with bombing a  building in Manila, and suspected of being the mastermind behind  several Philippine political assassinations. As well, some 40,000  lives have already been lost on both sides since the Communist  insurgency erupted in the 1970s, including more than 10,000  civilians. And those numbers are conservative.  ', 'What isn’t  well reported is the fact that Duterte has managed to strike a  deal with the Communists to keep them from creating havoc in  Davao, which sits smack bang in the middle of Communist territory  in the island’s south. They operate there, but non-violently.  Outside Davao though, the group still operates with impunity. ', 'In  other words, Duterte’s managed to create an island of stability  within an ocean of volatility because he’s managed to push  Communist extremism to the periphery of Davao.', 'This wouldn’t be possible on a national scale, simply because the  question arises, where would Duterte push the Communists out to?  An answer could lie in his suggestion of a ceasefire with them.  Bringing Sison back could be part of that plan: cessation of  violence in return for political inclusion. Not, if you can’t  beat them, join them. More, get them to join you, so everybody  stops fighting.  ', '  We know Duterte’s earmarked four cabinet portfolios for the CPP: land reform, the environment and natural resources, labor and  employment, and social welfare.', '  Any ceasefire would also likely mean the release of hundreds of  CPP prisoners. This is unlikely to sit well with the military,  who’ve spilled blood capturing these same people, and more blood  fighting thousands of others. ', 'But this could be the right time, if there is such a thing as a  right time to co-opt Communist revolutionaries. The NPA’s ranks  have shrunk over the years to less than 4,000 now. That’s only  about half a small army division. Perhaps the NPA is a spent  force. ', 'This month is also, coincidentally, the 50th anniversary of  China’s Cultural Revolution - that violent, decade long social  spasm that turned China upside down. ', 'There are reasons to worry we could be seeing a revival of that  ugly ’70′s show, in China as well as the Philippines. I’m  bothered by uncomfortable parallels between Duterte and Chinese  leader Xi Jinping. ', 'It’s not so much the cult of personality that’s been allowed to  center on both men. On both their parts it’s a preference for  ideology over institutions and formal systems. ', 'In Xi’s on-going onslaught against corruption, for example, he’s  used party spies and goons, as opposed to state prosecutors as  his dogs of war. For Duterte, it’s the death squads, vigilantes  and extra-judicial killings of druglords. Whether they were  actually in his employ or on his payroll is beside the point.  It’s the fact they were literally mercenaries, outside the  system. But they were working with him, and used by him. ', 'My point is, sometimes you can tell a man by the company he  keeps, who his friends are. Duterte hasn’t just dealt, done  business and negotiated with the Communists. He’s supped with  them.', 'Sure, the CPP partially funds itself by collecting “revolutionary  taxes” from businesses both big and small for the privilege and  security of operating in areas it controls. In imperfect  democracies, that arrangement is called the monthly neighborhood  shake-down. An extortion or protection racket by any other name.', 'But the CPP’s primary backer is still, no surprise, China. So  watch how Duterte plays the CPP, and China. It could be the  difference between finding common cause, and identifying with the  Communist cause.', '  Ladies and gentleman! In this corner, we have a a Viagra-enhanced  71-year-old, with an 11-0 election record and 30 years’ fighting  a devil’s assortment of reds, greens, and the new black in the  god-forsaken furthest point south in the Philippines, the  undisputed people’s champion,', '  The Punisher, Rooooooooo-dee, Duerte Harry, Rodrigo  Duterte!', '  But wait a minute. Who’s the challenger? Who’s on the back foot,  after Duterte’s crushing victory in the presidential elections? ', 'It’s pretty obvious who Duterte would describe under his breath  as “those bums I beat.” That would be “the establishment,” which  is why that’s one of the most important things to watch - whether  he reaches out, not just across the aisle, but across a huge  political gulf.  And who he reaches out to, what deals he  cuts.', '  This will take all the charm, persuasion, guile and possibly  “pork,” he can muster. Winning the establishment over, or at  least getting them to compromise, isn’t going to be easy. It’s  not just antipathy he’s up against, in some cases it’s vile  dislike. As I’ve written before, Philippine politics is intensely  personal.', '  Whether or not Duterte’s got the numbers in the Philippine House  and Senate matter a lot for legislation to do with everything  from signing off big infrastructure projects left on the table by  Aquino to a regional autonomy bill in the hope of quelling  southern unrest once and for all. Peace (and law and order) and  profits are linked. The more you have of the former, the more  likely you are to have of the latter - investments, development  aid, etc, which could be a bargaining chip for the incoming  president to win over his detractors.  ', '  Legislative numbers also matter if Duterte wants to push through  changes in the constitution, abolish Congress, and turn wholesale  towards a parliamentary form of government, which the Philippines  experimented with very briefly during the Marcos years. ', '  So, potentially big changes ahead. We know winning an election  isn’t the same as governing. ', '  But Duterte’s proven he can run a place even as Hobbesian as  Davao, that he can deal muscularly with druglords and militants.  But can he translate that management effectiveness on a national  scale?  ', '  We should watch to see if it’s going to be a long six years for  Duterte. Can Duterte, in sporting parlance, even “go the full  twelve”? Watch what kind of shape he’s in after the first three  months or so, the period journalists conveniently term his “first  100 days.”', '  I’d watch for what I call the 100-day stare. The political  equivalent of what military men call the “1,000-yard stare” - the  blank, vacant look of a soldier paralysed by the horrors he’s  seen in battle. At his last campaign rally Duterte implored  people, “Give me time,” to solve his country’s manifold problems. ', ' For the pugnacious political fighter from Davao, the clock’s  running. He’s unlikely to be saved by the bell.  If Duterte  goes down for the count, possibly because  he can’t get his  opponents onside, in politics as team sport, well, there’s always  the freshly minted Senator Manny Pacquiao, who could use his new,  elevated position, to make a run for the presidency in  2022. ', '  We’ll be keeping score. ', '  It’s not so much that I’ve got a bad feeling about the new,  incoming Duterte government in the Philippines. But the situation  does make me worry. ', 'A lot’s been written about nostalgia politics, the yearning in  the Philippines (as in America) for a strong, no-nonsense leader.  Rodrigo Duterte fits that description to a tee.', 'But, as always, self-styled champions of law and order, and the  poor - people’s presidents - usually come with compromises, which  the U.S. has learned time and again from working with dictators  of various stripes during the Cold War. ', 'The compromises are usually accommodated amid the greater aim of  protecting or furthering U.S. interests. In the case of the  Philippines, it’s as simple as ABC - allies, bases and crude  (oil). And they’re all connected, as these factors always tend to  be in geopolitics.', 'First, allies. Yes, the Philippines has been a strong and  dependable ally of the United States for several decades. It’s a  nation made in our image, as American journlist and historian  Stanley Karnow described it.', 'Sure, they kicked the U.S. out of bases in Subic and Clark in the  early ’90′s. That was then. Now, we’ve just recently signed a  basing deal that gives the U.S. access to five major military  installations across the Philippines - some for access to the  South China Sea, some to support counter-terror operations in the  south of the country. ', 'What did the State Department mean by its congratulatory  message to Duterte, in which it said America looked forward to  working with his new government on “issues of mutual interest”  and “common challenges”? It meant China, and Islamic State. ', 'So, tick A and B. What about C, crude oil? Well, that’s connected  to the first two because it’s centered on both the South China  Sea and the southern Philippine state of Mindanao. ', 'The sea lanes through the South China Sea aren’t just about  shipping access. They’re also about strategic access; for the  Seventh Fleet to continue acting as the region’s naval regulator,  and to check China’s push to project its power outside its  traditional sphere. Then there’s also the issue of access to  resources - oil and gas, and fisheries. Similarly for  Mindanao. ', 'In fact, Mindanao could be a jackpot for resource companies, as  well as for resource-hungry nations (read China). ', 'U.S. diplomatic cables thrown into the public domain by WikiLeaks  show that Washington has been aware for some time of an estimated  $1 trillion worth of oil, gas and minerals on and underneath  Mindanao and in the waters surrounding it. Whoever manages to  tame Mindanao gets access to all that wholesome resource  goodness. ', 'It’s easy to  see Duterte as a local politician potentially in over his head on  the national stage already, with the potential to be pushed and  pulled by two geopolitical giants.  ', '  But I suspect he’s the one who has leverage over both. ', ' Firstly, the U.S. will likely  continue dealing with Duterte, even if his administration  took the gloves off at home. Let’s say, if, just if,  he manages to change the constitution, abolish  Congress, and set himself up as a leftist dictator ... Well, it  wouldn’t be the first time such a thing’s happened in an  impoverished country.  ', '  And the U.S. has a history of working with these types. It’s not  so much a reversion to form, a continuation.  Imagine ″The  Donald″ doing business  with ″Duterte  Harry″? Both know how to  get things done. One’s a businessman. The other, well, we shall  find out. We all should be paying close attention. If it’s  Hillary who has to deal with Duterte, well, probably not much  difference. There’s politics, and there’re U.S. national  interests.  ', ' As for China, even if you  believe it’s a hegemon, it’s also a country that understands  pragmatism. It’ll share, even with the U.S., if there’s enough to  go around. In the Philippines, with the South China Sea and  resources, there’s a lot at stake. But plenty for everyone. I  believe China understands it doesn’t have to be a zero-sum game  with the U.S.', '  So for all those now-creaky Cold Warriors, its time to push  yourselves out of those La-Z-Boys, put on your reading glasses,  pop an Advil or three, and dust-off your playbook. ', '  Official results of the Philippine elections aren’t out yet, but  it’s clear Rodrigo Duterte is the new president. ', '  It’s not about the absolute numbers anymore, it’s the gulf  between Duterte, with most but not all votes counted, and his  nearest rival, Mar Roxas. Duterte leads by such a margin that, if  it was due to vote-buying or fraud, would be one of the biggest  thefts in political history. ', '  Similarly, with most but not all votes counted, it’s already  clear turnout hit record levels, comfortably above 81 percent.  This makes Duterte’s victory not just a landslide, but a  political earthquake as well. ', '  He’s just broken the monopoly on political power that a small  handful of powerful and inter-married families have enjoyed  pretty much since independence. ', '  So he’s a trailblazer. But he’s also set himself up, almost  certainly, to fail. Having made promises he will clean up  corruption within six months of taking office, expectations are  so high, they’re where the air starts getting thin.', '  Duterte needs to remember this election was a huge gamble for  voters. They’re trying something new out of desperation, because  the recent history of Philippine presidencies has been one of  almost serial failure in terms of the daily lives of the majority  of Filipinos.      ', '  Perhaps this is a good sign.', 'And to be fair to the out-going office-bearer, President Benigno  Aquino probably made more headway on improving the lot of the  average Philippine person than any leader in recent memory. But  the strong economic story hasn’t trickled down nearly far enough.  Not when 1-in-4 poverty, exemplified by Manila’s horrific slums,  still exists. ', 'It’s not so much a widening rich-poor gap (although this is true  too); That’s in larger part due to the rich getting richer, while  the poor seem to be trapped at the same level of poverty the  country hasn’t been to grow its way out of. ', 'It’s more about the quality of growth and, consequently, the  quality of life. Some peoples’ financial circumstances may have  improved but even the rich face the same struggles - traffic,  sclerotic infrastructure, a corrupt civil service, and crime.  Money just insulates them a little better. ', 'Can Duterte deliver? It’s not just the poor who voted for him  who’re watching whether the back-to-the-future style of  government he seems to be pointing to will work. The  establishment, whose monopoly on power he broke, are more than  ready to gloat if he fails. ', 'If he does, it will be the country’s loss. And for more than 100  million Filipinos, who’re among the most optimistic people on  earth, it’ll be just the latest disappointment for a people who  deserve better. ', '  With the almost-shock victory of Roddy Duterte as the new president of the Philippines pretty much in the bag, it’s  probably a good time to look back.  ', 'What? Not forward? What  about trying to figure out what his policy priorities are, how  he’s going to govern? We’ll get to that. Bear with me, first.   ', 'Duterte seems to me to be the kind of man who won’t forget  where he’s come from. And won’t forget who his friends are  either. Which makes me curious who’s actually behind him. A  politician who reportedly makes $2,000 a month after a 30-year  career in local politics probably won’t be a man of significant  means, right? ', 'Yet when confronted with the evidence, Duterte  admitted he had $5.7 million in the bank. In one account. From  rich friends, he joked. Maybe from savvy investing. But I doubt  it.  ', 'So who is bank-rolling Duterte? Philippine campaign  finance laws, such as there are, aren’t going to be much help.  There’re no caps on contributions to politicians and their  parties or campaigns. Politicians can pull in as much as  individual hearts prefer and corporate balance sheets can bear.   ', 'Politicians also aren’t obliged to go public about who  these people and companies are, until one month after the  elections. That’s right, after. By which time the money’s either  been spent or skimmed. And the political horse those people and  companies backed is already in power. Or not.  ', '  Sounds like a job for campaign finance reform. But which  politician would support it, when the rules have allowed them to  be, shall we say, so light on financial disclosure? ', 'Why’s this important? Because political financing, like organ  transplants, is the gift that keeps on giving. Or at least that’s  the expectation - that people, and particularly companies, that  back politicians with money are going to want a return. Let’s not  confuse politics, especially in Southeast Asia, with charity.  It’s the usual cycle of patronage politics - the more you give,  the more you expect back. ', 'Want an example? The non-profit Philippine Center for  Investigative Journalism found a total of just 301 entities -  people or companies - who financed the 2010 presidential  election. That’s more like the number of investors in a hedge  fund, or some other type of limited partnership investment  vehicle, and it concentrates influence over newly-elected president by putting it in very few hands.', 'We like to say there’s no such thing as a free lunch. In the case  of politics, it gives a very different meaning to the term “free  election,” or lack of one. ', 'The good news is, the formidable minds at the Financial  Times expect that there was a ramp-up in election spending this  year (a third more) by politicians as well as the government -  enough to bump up Philippiine GDP to between 6.5 percent and 7  percent this year from 5.8 percent in 2015.  Talk about  fiscal stimulus. ', 'But this isn’t investment in infrastructure, jobs, healthcare or  education. This is money that puts people in power. Leaders come  and go. Sometimes people are glad to see the back of them.', '  People are already focusing on the fact that Duterte’s party is  small. And how, so far, he doesn’t have the kind of personal  connections needed to form a legislative coalition. Politics in  the Philippines has traditionally been more about personalities  and loyalties than parties. Party-jumping is so common it’s a  veritable workout.  ', 'Personal chemistry and trust must play a  part. But you’d expect that, as concentrated as financing and  contributions are on such a small handful of people and  companies, money must play a bigger role in policy decisions and  governance. ', 'The question is what does that money want in  return? Call it political return on investment (ROI). Sometimes  the return is in the currency of position and power. Sometimes  it’s in the form of advantageous positioning for investments and  contracts.  ', '  I’d say watch the companies that start doing well, or better, as  the Duterte administration gets underway. Newer conglomerates,  which tend to be owned by Filipino-Chinese rather than old-line  Spanish/mestizo families, could have an advantage.

Then, former President Fidel Ramos, 88 years old but still very  much a political heavy, a true eminence grise. ', 'Finally, well into  last night, Roddy Duterte, the maverick Davao mayor and  front-runner who’s looks likely to become the next president of  the Philippines, when the country votes on Monday. ', 'The standout theme in what all of them said today,  was Mindanao, the second-largest and southern-most island in the  Philippines. ', 'Heydarian thinks about how the resource rich and highly cultivatable island province  could be the next driver of the Philippine economy. How that  can’t happen unless and until there’s a lasting peace and  political accommodation with militant Islamists and Communists in  control there. And how China could be the catalyst to make these  things happen.', 'Duterte, meanwhile, spent at least half of a three-hour  off-the-cuff address at his last rally before campaigning ended midnight Saturday talking about re-starting peace talks with  Mindanao militants. ', 'Practically, we assume that means leveraging his  extensive experience dealing with all the groups in a  30-year political career there in order to revive legislation that  stalled at the tail-end of the Aquino administration, which would  give Mindanao devolved authority, and disarm at least the Moro  militants. ', 'Ramos, who admits to having a big hand in in  Duterte’s decision to run for president, said a political solution to the problem  of the south would be key to the Philippine  economy’s future growth and development. In other words, peace  would lead to more prosperity. ', 'He also welcomed engagement with China, and Chinese  investment in the Philippines. ', '  Earlier, I wrote about a strong hunch that China could be a new  growth driver for the Philippines. ', '  The logic went: Cut a deal to compromise on the South China Sea,  draw-in Chinese investment in Philippine infrastructure, roll out  the red carpet for Chinese high-rollers at Manila’s casinos, and  let many of the same fellows buy up high-end Manila real  estate. ', '  Presto - new pillar for the economy, building on BPO and  remittances. ', '  But after all my recent listening, though, and the thinking that  followed, I’m adding Mindanao to the equation. ', '  To get engaged and involved in the Philippines, China would  likely require a show of good faith from Manila.', '  It could mean the Philippines keeping quiet (or at least not  rubbing it in Beijing’s face), if United Nations rules in favor  of Manila’s claim that China doesn’t own all of the South China  Sea, as is likely to happen when the Hague delivers its decision  on Manila’s claim in the next month or so. ', '  It could also mean revoking a recently inked agreement with the  United States to set up new bases in the Philippines - a deal  meant to counter China’s assertiveness in the South China Sea, as  well as support counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency efforts  against militants in the south. ', '  Being discrete on the Hague ruling would be fairly easy for the  new president. Aquino filed the case. ', '  The new president also has executive authority to renegotiate the  U.S. base agreement. Will he? If he can get China on-side,  possibly.', '  Once China’s satisfied diplomatically, on the South China Seas,  and U.S. access to Philippine bases, we get to the  roll-up-your-sleeves work. That is, settling the south  politically, then developing it, through heavy Chinese  investment. ', '  And what would China want from all this? For one thing, access to  resources in Mindanao, which U.S. and Australian companies have  struggled to exploit. China and its companies, on the other hand,  aren’t as hung up on law and contracts. ', '  For another, possibly favorable positioning and access to jointly  developing resources in the South China Sea.', '  Is it too far fetched to imagine that China’s already  kick-started this whole chain of events? ', '  Maybe my brain’s been in over-drive a bit too long. But something  clicked when I started hearing talk - unsubstantiated - that  Duterte could be receiving financial support from China, possibly  through Filipino-Chinese tycoons.

In the  Third World, people don’t have that luxury.', '  The Philippines belongs to the much more grey Second World. It  hasn’t arrived. But it’s managed to pull itself out of the  anonymity of countries too poor to be gifted with any sort of  easily recognizable international identity, other than notoriety.', '  But poverty in the Philippines is still a good story.

She recalled the incident  had left her looking both ways when  leaving the office. “This is like a big guy,  who comes in ... huge presence. We felt really uncomfortable, but  it was also really enlightening for us.”', ' Despite the decline in U.S. manufacturing, a “Made  in the USA” label is still desirable in global markets.', '  It brings a certain assurance that products are made according to  high production standards, using safe materials. Over the years,  that label has also become synonymous with high labor costs. But  the cost of foreign labor is on the rise, and it’s beginning to  level the playing field for U.S. manufacturers.', '  Finding a domestic manufacturer, however, can be time consuming.  Most brands don’t like to share manufacturing information because  they don’t want to help their competition. “It was almost taboo  to ask,” Burnett said.', ' Read MoreHow one entrepreneur is reviving ‘Made  in USA’ wool', '  Plus, many older manufacturers don’t have their own websites, which  only compounds the domestic sourcing challenge.', '  One way to find a manufacturer is to get help from a  broker, if you can find one.

', ' “Some of these consultants were basically hoarding the  information and charging $5,000. It’s impossible. Five to $10,000  for any small business?” Burnett said. “I would never pay that. I  couldn’t pay it. I’m paying $10,000 for maybe my first run of  products.”', '  Burnett has first-hand experience in the maze of domestic  manufacturing.

It was a dream since his childhood in Detroit, where he saw  his grandfather make watches. ', '  In 2007, he began to market his own brand, Steel Cake. Using  connections he’d developed through big designers, he had product  made in China, which presented hurdles. Larger orders get  priority, and it can take months for shipments to arrive in the  U.S. So Burnett had to build inventory without knowing whether it  would sell. ', 'He also couldn’t afford to have staff on site to  monitor the process for quality control. One costly mistake was  enough to put him out of business, “There’s this manufacturing  error that occurred in about $35,000 worth of lost merchandise. I  couldn’t take it,” Burnett recalled. “It ended up being just too  much of a gamble being so far away from my manufacturing  facilities.”', '  So he got out of watches and began crafting leather goods,  sourcing materials and manufacturing locally in New York City.  His new brand, Brooklyn Bakery, began to take off, but the search  for manufacturing help took months, diverting his attention from  designing, marketing and selling goods.

It was a very low-risk, very profitable type of  business,” Menendez said.', '  Burnett said that managing the size of orders was the key to their  success. “When I was producing domestically, I wasn’t producing a  thousand of each product. I was producing a dozen of each  product. That means that I’m able to test the market. See what  works and press the pedal to the metal, when I see that something  is moving.”', '  As they met with manufacturers and other entrepreneurs,  especially the start-ups selling their wares on websites like  Etsy and Shopify, Menendez and  Burnett began to realize that the search for  manufacturing help was a constant issue. So they decided to do  something about it. ', '  Maker’s Row went live in November of 2012. Within months, they learned it wasn’t just small businesses that needed help  finding U.S. manufacturers. The problem was much bigger than  that.', '  “Big brands are having this problem, too. We see that Wal-Mart is signing up. We see that  Burberry is signing up. These are the kings of industry that  we’re looking at here,” Burnett said. Big brands using Maker’s  Row was a big surprise “because if anyone was to have  this information, we thought that it would be the big brands.”', '  The timing is certainly good for Maker’s Row. ', '  There’s a lot of confidence among U.S. manufacturers these days.  A recent survey by the Boston Consulting Group revealed that 16  percent of the 252 U.S. manufacturers who responded are  reshoring jobs from China, a 20 percent jump from a year ago,  and more than double the number from February 2012.', ' Read MoreWelcome home: ‘Made in USA’ on the  rise', '  Back then, Burnett and Menendez were just beginning to wonder how  they could find enough manufacturers to make Maker’s Row a  success. It was a tough sell at first, but they began to  list manufacturers on the site for free, which turned out to be a  smart move because some of them saw almost immediate results.', '  “People started to see leads before Maker’s Row asked them to  sign up for their service,” according to Mitch Cahn, who runs  Unionwear, a maker of baseball caps and bags in Newark, New  Jersey. With leads in hand, it became much easier for Burnett and  Menendez to sign up other manufacturers.', '  “We get several inquiries a day from Maker’s Row,” said Cahn, who  bought a former baseball cap factory in nearby Jersey City in 1992, when, he said, there were about 400 baseball cap  manufacturers in the United States. These days, he said, there are  only about four but he believes the playing field for domestic  manufacturers has leveled because the cost of labor overseas is  climbing dramatically, making “Made in USA” more of a reality,  than a lofty ambition. “There had been interest before but it was  really a lot of talk,” he said. “Now that the price differential  is so much smaller, people are saying, ‘Hmmm, I may spend another  20 percent to get a product ‘Made in the USA.’ Five years ago, it  might have been another 100 percent.”', '  Local governments have gotten on board to help Maker’s Row,  hoping to help their local manufacturers at the same time.  They’ve had a large number of sign-ups in Los Angeles and Chicago, too. In about two years they’ve signed up approximately 5,000  manufacturers. A good thing, because there are also about 50,000  brands using the site to look for help. Subscriptions to Maker’s  Row begin at $25 a month.', '  It’s a similar story at Genil Accessories in Brooklyn, where Gina  Bihm and her staff make bow ties and neckties for the likes of  Vineyard Vines and Marc Jacobs. Despite her big-name clients,  Bihm says she also tries to help the little guy create a sample, if they can find her. “I don’t turn away no one. No one,” she  said.', '  Bihm said the recession that began in 2007 nearly put her out of  business. At the time she was shipping out about 20,000 pieces  per year. In 2008 and 2009 work was hard to come by. Her entire  staff, once numbering about 20 full-timers, was cut to zero. She  needed a loan to pay the rent on her work space. She still has  only 11 full-time employees, but she says business is better than  ever.

The rest is science. #GoodbyeCassini', 'Launched in 1997, the bus-size spacecraft was overseen by NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The project began nearly 30 years ago.', 'After traveling roughly 1 billion miles, according to NASA, Cassini entered Saturn’s orbit in 2004 and began sending information that frequently surprised scientists. ', 'Among those surprises: Cassini revealed a huge six-sided jet stream on the planet’s top that holds huge hurricane-like storms within it. There is a lot about this hexagon researchers don’t know, such as why it is there and how it has managed to sustain itself for so long. ', 'The craft flew to Enceladus, a tiny moon with ingredients that could make it suitable for life.', 'Cassini also dispatched the Huygens lander to Titan, Saturn’s largest moon, where it discovered a vast underground ocean, and liquid methane on its surface that undergoes a cycle similar to that of water on Earth. ', '“In order to avoid the unlikely possibility of Cassini someday colliding with one of these moons, NASA has chosen to safely dispose of the spacecraft in the atmosphere of Saturn,” Jet Propulsion Lab officials said in a statement. “This will ensure that Cassini cannot contaminate any future studies of habitability and potential life on those moons.”', 'Combined, the Cassini-Huygens mission cost about $3.26 billion, according to NASA.

41,Reid Hoffman has billions of dollars and one of the best networks in Silicon Valley. Here’s how he’s using them to take on Trump.,2017-09-05T13:19:40+0000,"['It began with a simple card trick.', 'Reid Hoffman had grown tired of listening to Donald Trump trash talk Hillary Clinton and his ever-growing list of political foes. So the LinkedIn co-founder cooked up plans during the presidential election to challenge Trump at his own game — a card game, to be exact, where players could compete to outdo each other in crafting the most offensive phrases possible.', 'The release of “Trumped Up Cards” in the fall of 2016 marked a new turn for the affable, pensive Hoffman, who soon embarked on something of a media blitz, including a rare appearance on the “The Daily Show” to tout the game. The effort was really about trying “to help people understand what I believe was the absurdity of the Trump presidency,” Hoffman recalled to Recode in an interview this August.', 'In 2017, though, there’s nothing absurd about it: Trump now sits in the Oval Office. But Hoffman still isn’t ready to allow the president to have the last laugh: He’s gearing up to spend what could turn out to be hundreds of millions of dollars on campaigns, candidates and causes that can fulfill his vision for a better future for the United States.', 'Or, to translate it into the language of Hoffman’s own industry: One of Silicon Valley’s growth areas in 2017 is politics, and Hoffman is now its most active investor.', 'Though it initially seemed like a lark, Hoffman’s Trump-focused card game grew into an early avenue for the LinkedIn co-founder to donate to the American Civil Liberties Union, which is aggressively fighting Trump’s agenda in court. Recently, Hoffman has funded more substantive endeavors like Win the Future — an attempt to rethink the Democratic Party and how it drafts candidates — which he created with Mark Pincus, the co-founder of gaming company Zynga.', 'Newly, though, Hoffman is eager to open his checkbook for state and federal office-seekers, including for critical races in Virginia. There, he’s already spent millions of dollars and tapped staff on the ground to study the state’s local elections, hoping to fund get-out-the-vote initiatives and other ideas that might work elsewhere in the country — all the while nudging its Republican-dominated legislature in the direction of Democrats.', 'Like many in the Valley, Hoffman’s pique with the White House began almost immediately after Election Day. And the rift between Trump and tech is likely to widen again come Tuesday, when the president is expected to terminate DACA, a program that prevents children brought to the United States illegally from being deported. The widely rumored end of those protections led Hoffman and more than 300 other business leaders to rebuke the White House publicly last weekend.', 'But what sets Hoffman apart, said his friends and political allies, is his deliberate, well-funded — and, to some, secretive — campaign to apply his smarts and investing acumen toward seeding a national political movement.', '“I’ve seen him spend a huge amount of his mental cycles and time on politically related activities, from helping start new groups to [backing] candidates ... and really trying to be thoughtful about how he can contribute to the resistance,” said Sam Altman, the president of Y Combinator, another techie who has become politically active since Trump’s victory last November. “A lot of people are talking about this, but they haven’t been allocating their time and money in the way [Hoffman] has.”', 'The world of big-money politics, of course, is difficult terrain. For years, Democrats and their allies have struggled to match the savvy aggressiveness of Charles Koch and David H. Koch, the right-wing industrialists whose checks have become the seed corn for conservatives’ greatest victories.', 'Hoffman and his lot may bristle at any comparison to the Koch Brothers; in fact, Hoffman recently visibly grimaced when a person close to him suggested he become “The Koch brother of the left.” (His aides stress he’s far more centrist, anyway.)', 'But Hoffman’s allies still agree their geek-god, advice-doling friend is perhaps the only tech figure right now with the rare combination of cash and connections to become their political operator — providing the fuel for efforts to stop future candidates similar to Trump, if not Trump himself, in their tracks.', 'Even Hoffman gets it.', 'More from Recode:', '“I got past my dismay in November, and in December, started thinking about my responsibility as a citizen,” Hoffman told me. “I tend to think when you’ve been lucky and fortunate enough to make some money, you have a position of power, it’s like Spider-Man ethics — with power comes responsibility.”', 'For months, he had been quietly advising Hillary Clinton as the Democratic presidential contender formed her views on technology.', 'In Clinton, Hoffman had found a sharp, seasoned candidate receptive to his ideas, including a desire to rethink U.S. education. And in Hoffman, the former secretary of state had embraced a walking, talking rolodex who could connect Democrats to the well-heeled tech types they needed to fund their bid for the White House — and, eventually, support Clinton’s administration.', 'By election night, Hoffman figured his work was just beginning. He had even spoken to Clinton’s team about sliding from his loose advisory role during the campaign into some sort of position aiding her expected transition to the presidency. It would have been a powerful perch, affording Hoffman a unique chance to shape an Oval Office by helping to hand-pick some of the very people who would compose and advise it.', 'To his peers in Silicon Valley, such a move might not have seemed like an incredible upgrade. Often wary of the stuffy suits of Washington, D.C., the tech industry tends to view its own backyard — however solipsistically — as a much more powerful economic epicenter with the real, true power to rewire the whole of the country.', 'Hoffman had benefited from tech’s rise, already enormously wealthy, as the founder of seminal companies like PayPal and LinkedIn, and as a leading investor at Greylock Partners — a firm where he and his team profited considerably after an early bet on Facebook. He is now worth more than $3 billion.', 'But his cachet transcends cash: He’s the Valley’s fountain of advice, a big-ideas type, a former student of philosophy at Stanford and Oxford whom the New York Times dubbed the “startup whisperer” in 2011. Many in the Bay Area see him in the mold of the late Bill Campbell, the longtime tech executive who was called “Coach” for his role advising tech moguls.', 'In politics, Hoffman had bigger aspirations last year than merely funding the next hot app. And like many in the tech universe, Hoffman assumed on election night he would be celebrating Clinton’s victory. He planned to exercise and then meet his wife, Michelle Yee, who was watching state-by-state returns with a family friend.', '“I got out of my workout, and I had this text on my phone saying, ‘Come over to our friend’s house,’” Hoffman recounted to Recode. “And I was like, ‘Oh, this has got to be bad news’.”', 'The night quickly devolved from bad to worse for Clinton, and it soon became clear to Hoffman that he certainly would not be celebrating — or whispering into the president’s ear, either. He and his wife went home, he said, and “watched the first episode of the first season of ‘West Wing.’”.', 'The early 2000s political drama that reassured Hoffman last fall now seems like obvious fantasy compared to the tumultuous Trump White House, where the president’s penchant for conflict over inquisitiveness is evident in his ever-souring relationship with the tech industry.', 'Initially, though, Trump tried a reconciliation of sorts with the help of Peter Thiel, the only major tech titan to back the president before his election. Before inauguration, Thiel even officially joined Trump’s transition team — assuming the sort of kingmaker role that his friend, Hoffman, might have held if the election had resolved differently.', 'And as one of his first, major acts, Thiel organized a peace ceremony with the leaders of Apple, Amazon, Google and other tech giants — companies Trump had mocked on the campaign trail. With noses pinched, those leaders publicly offered early, though tepid, praise for Trump — and even pledged to work with him. But their uncomfortable truce lasted mere weeks before the two sides began battling over issues like immigration and equal rights.', 'Hoffman didn’t attend that meeting, but his absence wasn’t too surprising: The president-elect wanted to meet only with those he considered major chief executives, and many didn’t receive an invite. (Just ask Twitter.)', 'Then again, Hoffman had never really been the type for that sort of public political showmanship. Despite his prominence in Silicon Valley, he long maintained a much lower profile in matters of government, remaining more of a quiet political confidant. In easier times, Hoffman dined privately with former President Barack Obama during his few trips to the Bay Area. And while Hoffman later donated $1 million to Obama’s reelection effort in 2012, he never became a public campaign trail surrogate for the now-former Democratic leader.', 'Four years later, Hoffman didn’t begin the 2016 presidential race with a full-throated, shout-it-from-the-mountains endorsement of Clinton, either.', '“Part of it is, it is a little confusing as to how this is all going to play out. I say it is likely that I’m going to come out, depending on how you read the tea leaves, supporting Hillary,” Hoffman said at a conference in 2015, as Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders duked it out for the party’s nomination.', '“But to some degree it is kind of like, okay, it hasn’t yet been important for me to get involved,” he continued. “The way that I tend to get involved is: Do I think that I can make a big difference? If I think I can make a big difference, I get involved.”', 'To be sure, Hoffman always felt Clinton was more than qualified to run the United States. He matched his confidence with an early donation and quickly found himself in contact with her campaign chairman, John Podesta, talking about ways to help her administration on “Day 1,” according to hacked emails published by WikiLeaks.', 'By the spring of 2016, Hoffman even had a hands-on unofficial role as part of a close circle of tech thinkers who were helping draft Clinton’s tech policy platform. Those who participated said Hoffman focused much of his time on education.', 'Automation and the impact of gig-economy-style companies — the stuff of Greylock’s own portfolio — long had concerned Hoffman. And he had been particularly worried about the way U.S. schools prepare students for the workforce. At one point, Hoffman had argued that college degrees had become outdated in the fast-moving digital economy.', 'That desire to map the skills in greatest need in the U.S. job market — and to rethink work altogether — helped form the bedrock of LinkedIn’s own push to start crunching the data it had amassed on its millions of users, which it ultimately shared with Obama and the U.S. government. With Clinton, Hoffman saw a similar opportunity to shape an administration’s thinking before it even became an actual administration, sources said.', 'The resulting 14-page tech policy platform that Clinton released in June 2016 mirrored some of Hoffman’s beliefs in STEM education and other programs meant to spur entrepreneurs. “I think he wanted to bring his private-sector, personal experiences to bear,” Sara Solow, the top policy adviser for Clinton at the time, told Recode in an interview.', 'Almost eight months after Trump first stepped foot in the Oval Office, Hoffman has grown increasingly fearful about the state of U.S. politics.', 'The often soft-spoken entrepreneur grew fiery when he started to think aloud about the implications of the new leader of the free world: ”[Trump] claims he has a tremendous medical plan; he has no medical plan. He was relying on Republican congresspeople, who also mostly have been campaigning against Obamacare ... as opposed to having a plan of [his] own. [Trump] says, ‘Hey, I’m going to do these great trade deals,’ but doesn’t understand how the modern trade [system] works. He wants to do the presidency as a whole reality TV show, not exactly as a serious theory of governance.”', 'We spoke in August, weeks before reports emerged that Trump might end deportation protections for children brought here illegally — called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. It’s a program that Hoffman, and others in his camp, have vigorously defended.', 'As the threat of Trump has matured, so have Hoffman’s political endeavors — beginning with his new efforts to find and fund solutions to some of the country’s most intractable political ills. It’s a role well-suited for him, his friends and co-workers say, as the people person of his own industry.', '“As with any startup investment, I think he’s making a decision based in one part on the people, the specific people, and his belief in people,” said Matt Cohler, a former LinkedIn executive, who is now a prominent venture capitalist at Benchmark.', 'That transcends political party, Cohler added: “I think he’s much more focused on the positives of what needs to happen to ensure the country remains healthy, as opposed to being really politicized.”', 'Still, it’s who’s in power that counts, which is why a key early target for Hoffman is the state of Virginia. Its statewide election this year will determine whether Democrats retain control of the governor’s mansion and dislodge the Republicans who currently dominate the legislature. In addition, Virginia is in the midst of a major battle over the invisible lines that compose federal congressional districts. State lawmakers play a major role in ratifying that redistricting plan, which is why the upcoming 2017 election contest is all the more crucial for Democrats.', 'But turnout there and elsewhere in the United States always tends to suffer in years when a presidential candidate isn’t on the ballot. Meanwhile, the same political ills that pervaded the last election — like fake news — certainly haven’t diminished in resonance this time around. That’s why Hoffman and his team began discussing in March how to use Virginia as something of a tech test bed, said Dmitri Mehlhorn, a well-wired political strategist who’s been helping the LinkedIn co-founder with his political activities.', 'In Mehlhorn’s eyes, Hoffman had a particular goal in mind: “How can we take scale-up expertise from Silicon Valley,” he recalled, “to create platforms that make American democracy more robust, so that after 2020, we are resilient against fake news, we are voting at high levels [and] we are voting in an enlightened way?”', 'To start, Hoffman has shelled out about $1.4 million so far to a series of groups including Vote.org and Democracy Works, which aim to help get voters — regardless of party — to the polls on election day. Another slice of his early aid has gone to Higher Ground Labs, sources said, a collection of Obama’s former digital advisers who are trying to help their party take advantage of new, cutting-edge campaign technology.', 'With these and other projects, Hoffman’s allies told Recode, it’s all about trial-by-error. Much like any traditional tech investment, there’s always a chance the ideas might not work — in Virginia or elsewhere — but nonetheless the potential that they could instead pay dividends at a critical time in U.S. politics.', '“The thing that Gen. Mattis said to his troops” — “hold the line” until America becomes less divided — “that’s part of what we’re talking about,” Mehlhorn said in an interview, referring to the secretary of defense. “How do we get society working again?”', 'Meanwhile, Hoffman has doubled down on Democratic causes in the state, opting earlier this year to write a $50,000 check to Win Virginia, a political-action committee run by former Congressman Tom Perriello, according to local campaign finance disclosures.', 'Executives like Hoffman “understand this is the best beta test for anything next year,” Perriello said in an interview. That’s when many lawmakers in the U.S. Congress, currently controlled by Republicans, are up for reelection, and Democrats hope they can recapture the House of Representatives.', 'Nationally, Hoffman has focused his early 2018 efforts on another body, the Senate, where Democrats are at greatest risk of losing seats in states that Trump carried. Chunks of the total $76,000 he’s donated at the federal level since early January 2017 have landed with candidates such as North Dakota’s Heidi Heitkamp, Missouri’s Claire McCaskill and Pennsylvania’s Bob Casey, federal records show.', 'It’s important since Trump has specifically targeted McCaskill. He visited her home state last week, pledging to help oust her, while unveiling his short-on-details tax plan. Heitkamp is also vulnerable: She’s probably the only Democrat who could even compete in unfriendly territory like North Dakota, and without her, the party’s already difficult task of taking back the Senate gets even less realistic in 2018.', 'Hoffman’s support isn’t exclusive to Democrats: Since the beginning of 2017, he has contributed $10,000 to a fund to help Massachusetts Republicans and another $1,000 to Charlie Baker, Massachusetts’ Republican governor. Soon, Hoffman also hopes to recruit his own candidates, potentially through another one of his investments, Win the Future. Together, he and the group’s founder, Zynga’s Pincus, have poured $500,000 into the effort so far.', 'Pincus had been “talking on the side with Reid Hoffman about this idea for 15 years,” he told Recode earlier this year before launch of the group, known as WTF. What they had lacked was a “catalyst,” Pincus said — something Trump provided.', '“And then along came Trump, and he seems like a wave machine,” said Pincus at the time, “activating a lot of people.”', 'Hoffman hasn’t forgotten old political friends either, including Obama. He’s now a major donor to the former president’s foundation, which will be the hub for the construction of Obama’s official library in Chicago.', 'As with many of Hoffman’s commitments, he won’t talk about the size of his donation to Obama’s effort, which so far has revealed little about its plans. But Hoffman says it is a three-year cash pledge — and hinted it could be in the millions of dollars.', 'Still, the foundation is one of a number of nonprofits working at the nexus of policy and politics that he is newly supporting in 2017, as he seeks to fund potential solutions to some of the most urgent problems in the age of Trump.', 'In a bid to facilitate new debate over issues like critical justice reform, for example, Hoffman recently has backed The Dream Corps, an outfit founded by CNN’s Van Jones, who’s been traveling the country talking about those issues. With an eye on the divide between urban and rural communities, Hoffman has put new cash toward the Center on Rural Innovation, a relatively unknown Vermont group that studies and tries to help local regions improve their economies and jobs, he said.', 'The LinkedIn co-founder has renewed his investments this year into three companies — including Change.org, PopVox and, soon, Crowdpac — that help citizens sound off to government, track their policymakers’ work and back candidates for office, respectively. And Hoffman has offered new financial help to the Union of Concerned Scientists, a coalition that long has advocated for more federal science spending. The aid comes at a time when Trump has clamped down on climate-change research and other government programs that fund science and medicine.', 'For these civically inclined startups and campaigns, the donations come at an urgent moment. Many investors on Silicon Valley’s legendary Sand Hill Road always have looked skeptically at cash-strapped, policy-inclined companies, choosing instead to support commerce-focused founders with the greatest chance of delivering a much-higher-return public offering.', 'But startups and nonprofits in the political space have proliferated wildly in the months after Trump’s election — from groups that try to arm political campaigns with tech-engineer expertise to apps and other services trying to nudge Congress on policy issues like health care. The new field is so crowded that other leading investors, like Ron Conway, earlier this year put together a cheat sheet — sent to other, like-minded donors — on who or what to fund.', 'Hoffman’s assistance, at least, seems to carry a unique upside. “One of the greatest things about Reid’s approach, specifically to the civic space, has been to provide some investment and see where it goes,” explained Marci Harris, the CEO of PopVox. “He’s not a micromanager.”', 'Hoffman still hasn’t talked to Trump. And, at the current rate, he might not ever talk to the president.', 'From Apple’s Tim Cook to Laurene Powell Jobs, whose group, Emerson Collective, has been active on immigration issues, some tech executives have tried to whisper into Trump’s ear. They’ve angled to shape the White House’s agenda in secret, aiming to avoid the wrath of their president-hating peers in the Valley. Still, though, Trump has persisted with policymaking efforts considered anathema to more than just the tech industry.', '“Look, I think my answer earlier in the year would have been, ‘I would talk with you and I would try to provide advice, but I hold in reserve my willingness to speak publicly about what I think is right,’” Hoffman said.', 'But now, he added: “That ship has sailed.”', 'The public breaking point for him — and the rest of tech — came in August, when Trump refused to blame neo-Nazis for violence in Charlottesville, Va. Before Trump’s comments, companies like IBM, Intel and Dell tried to advise the president through formal channels, hoping to shape policy even tech employees protested their work with the White House. But Trump’s remarks left those industry leaders no choice but to cease assisting his administration on two, key business advisory councils.', 'Consider the difference that seven months makes: On the eve of the president’s inauguration, tech giants seemed reluctant to engage the White House in open warfare, sitting with him publicly at Trump Tower in a bid to make peace.

But pretty much true.', 'So, in what is probably a vain attempt to clarify the situation, here’s the state of what is a very confused play:', 'With the exit of Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman from consideration, several sources with knowledge of the situation said the group of four final candidates being considered are all men and all CEOs. (Also: Only one of those is a person of color.)', 'Among those choices is outgoing GE CEO Jeff Immelt. But Immelt is not, said several sources, the top choice of several members of the search committee and also within Uber’s top ranks. Some are worried that — while he is obviously a very experienced manager — he lacks the entrepreneurial drive to take the company to the next level.', 'In other words, he’s too much a corporate suit and not enough a geek pirate. (Anywhere else but in tech, this is not seen as a bad thing, but here we are.)', 'Immelt aside, sources said that the inclusion of more women in key decision-making roles at Uber will come via the addition of more independent board members and top execs rather than as its main leader.', 'That, of course, will be a major disappointment to some, especially given major problems at Uber involve sexism and sexual harassment. While gender of a leader should not matter to dispatching such appalling behaviors, the symbolism over the appointment of a female CEO at Silicon Valley’s most toxic-bro startup is unquestionable.', 'But there are also not that many top women CEOs to pick from. Execs like Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg and General Motors’ Mary Barra were not interested, said sources, and others pursued, like EasyJet CEO Carolyn McCall, did not pan out.', 'It had been hoped that the decision on who will be the next leader of Uber would be completed within the next week, but trouble getting the board to coalesce and trust each other has and continues to complicate the effort.', 'In addition, sources said the not all board members had met all the top candidates as of this weekend, so that no vote on any one of them had been planned or is planned immediately. (Uber’s board now meets regularly every two weeks, so that could change.)', 'That lack of cohesion impacted the courting of Whitman, which never resulted in any vote (and which had never been scheduled at all, despite one report that it was). This was largely because she had not met with all directors before she suddenly pulled her name out of consideration late last week.', 'Sudden indeed. Whitman was expected this past weekend to meet in person with more directors, including Wan Ling Martello of Nestlé and Arianna Huffington, which never happened.', 'Whitman’s departure from the Uber fray was considerably more complicated than has been previously reported. The well-known exec, who is also one of the most prominent women leaders in tech, was indeed interested in the job. That included having several substantive discussions with directors, where she made a series of suggestions on how to fix Uber.', 'Still, sources close to Whitman said she was never formally offered the job by Uber’s board, even though she certainly was intrigued by the possibility.', 'And why not? Such a role would have been the capstone of a long and largely successful career, most especially in growing eBay to its heights from a small startup. Turning around Uber and taking it public would have been the ultimate addition to her legacy.', 'But board disagreements, worries about whether all the myriad of problems at Uber had surfaced and concerns about the continued involvement of Kalanick, as well as the public disclosure of Whitman as a possible candidate, ended that possibility.', '“Uber’s CEO will not be Meg Whitman,” she tweeted on Thursday, days after media reports on Tuesday by Recode and Bloomberg that disclosed Uber’s interest in her. That then put pressure on Whitman, a situation made worse by another report in Axios that indicated that she was not a unanimous choice of the board.', 'Such mishegas irked Whitman, who expected a more — ahem — professional process. “What a mess,” said one person. “Why should she get dirtied by their playground antics? It’s like a sandbox over there.”', 'Well, to be fair, more like a really nerdy version of “Game of Thrones,” with 100 percent less dismemberment but 53 percent more intrigue.', 'Still, as Recode previously reported, Whitman was an early investor in Uber and has helped out with coaching from time to time, especially with Kalanick, so she did have some familiarity with the unusually juvenile management style there.', 'But sources said she did not like the process, and gave the board a 48-hour deadline to decide if they seriously wanted her to be CEO. While some on the board wanted to move forward immediately, others — Huffington, for example — did not since she had not met them all in person.', '“It was artificial urgency, even if Whitman might be the right choice,” said one source.', 'No matter! Whitman out!', 'That might not have mattered, as Whitman was also worried more specifically about further disclosures to come from the company related to its lawsuit with Alphabet’s Waymo, especially how involved Kalanick was in the allegations leveled against Uber.', '“Who knows what could fall out that the closet over there?,” said one person, reflecting the concerns of many candidates who have spoken to Uber, including Whitman. “There could be even more skeletons.”', 'Kalanick’s continued role figures large in the every person I spoke to who has been contacted about the CEO job.', 'What’s the biggest problem at Uber?, I asked.', '“Travis,” said one', '“Oh, Travis,” said another.', '“Man, he’s brilliant and so important, but who wants to deal with Travis?,” said yet another.', 'If that sounds like a real sad country song, titled “The Travis Blues,” you are not far off the mark.', 'This was certainly not the plan when Kalanick was dispatched to Tahiti to sail around a glamourous yacht — owned by media mogul Barry Diller, with fellow guests like CNN’s Anderson Cooper — to cool after he was forced out at Uber.', 'He initially had agreed to take just a temporary leave, a move that became permanent after a group of key investors — including Benchmark — demanded his full departure a week later.', 'More from Recode:', 'The New Yorker gets an intense Mooch bumpElon Musk is preparing to go through ‘production hell’ to deliver Tesla’s Model 3 on timeStitch Fix has filed confidentially for an IPO', 'But once he returned from the South Seas, his ardor for meddling in the company did not end. According to numerous insiders, the pugnacious entrepreneur has continued to try to involve himself in daily operating decisions, so much so that top execs have been mulling how to get help from the board to rein him in.', '“It’s not stopped,” said one top exec about Kalanick up in the grill of the operating group that is running Uber. “None of us know what to do since it is Travis.”', 'In addition, to cut off Kalanick’s access, the Uber board has reinforced a policy that all directors get the same limited access to information about Uber’s ongoing operations. “We have had to put guide rails on him,” said one person involved. “Even if he keeps trying to break through them.”', 'Indeed, Kalanick was considered by many directors and investors to be obstructive to the process of finding a COO before his departure as CEO.', 'And there have been more signals that he has been unhappy about this status. Since he left, Kalanick has told numerous people, including at least one job candidate, that he was “Steve Jobs-ing it,” an apparent reference to the purge and later return of the legendary Apple founder at the company.', '(As I have said before, I knew Steve Jobs, Steve Jobs was a person I wrote about and — you got it — Travis Kalanick is no Steve Jobs. But I digress!)', 'But the key tenet in this comparison is that the tarnished tech hero leaves the scene to wander in the desert for years before the triumphant return. Instead, what has been described to me by many is an entrepreneur who cannot let go and, in fact, has been trying to plot ways to increase his grip.', 'Why? “If you think about it, Uber has been his life and it’s only more so with his terrible personal situation,” said one person, who is fond of Kalanick, referring to the recent tragic death of his mother and the serious injuries sustained by his father in a boating accident. “Giving up Uber is not easy.”', 'And being with each other in a cohesive manner is not something Uber’s current board seems capable of either, given all the odd back-channeling and frequent miscommunications that seem to crop up.', 'While there was a recent dinner at San Francisco’s Garabaldi’s restaurant that included Huffington, Ling and two other Uber board members, TPG’s David Trujillo and Benchmark’s Matt Cohler, to try to create some level of comfort, there is a lot to repair.', 'Here’s a clue to how much: The continued media leakage from the CEO process. While this is not completely uncommon — the Microsoft CEO search got a lot of ink — what is unusual is how varying the accounts of the same meetings or circumstances are at Uber. In fact, they are often diametrically opposed to each other.', 'This is something that many who have been in touch with Uber have experienced. “Consensus is not something you are feeling is happening there,” said one person, which makes every possible move seem suspect.', '(Have to seen the really complexly plotted spy thriller “Atomic Blonde,” where everyone seems to be lying and then lying about lying? Uber is more confusing.)', 'That’s why a recent attempt to discuss a funding offer involving both secondary sales and a new investment from Japanese investor SoftBank has been so riven. While I will not get into the particulars in this hairball of a story here — unless you really want to hear about transfer restrictions, tender offers and more right now — suffice it to say that it has turned into a drama about whose side SoftBank leader Masa Son will land on.', 'Let me be clear, this is before any investment, which really should not take place without the cooperation of the new CEO, even if there is some urgency in making sure SoftBank’s $100 billion fund does not favor only Uber’s rivals. Since it just made a big investment in Southeast Asia’s Grab, many at Uber remain fretful.', 'Also, a related cause of tension was a Bloomberg report that Benchmark was mulling selling all of its 10 percent stake in Uber to SoftBank, which sources said was not true. While the venture firm might sell some of its stake if any transaction takes place, sources said Benchmark was wary that such a story was meant to weaken it.', 'That might not be so far-fetched given the deep tension between Benchmark’s Bill Gurley — who left the Uber board in favor of his partner Cohler — and Kalanick and the level of mistrust that has developed over time.', '“Every single act feels like it might have another meaning,” said one person familiar with the situation. “Even if it does not.”', 'What is all boils down to is the deep concerns around control of Uber’s fate: Who has it and who is angling for it.', 'That distrust has left the board at times in a kind of odd face-off that appears to be more perception than reality, once you really plum the depth of the concerns.', 'Consider the possible return of Kalanick as CEO, which most will finally admit is overblown unless he decides to go full throttle and end up in a legal fight with the company he founded. In reality, without the support of board members Ryan Graves and Garrett Camp, Kalanick has none of the kind of leverage than has been reported.', '“Travis would have to blow it up completely to get his job back,” said one major investor, familiar with the cap table of Uber. “And maybe he is crazy enough to do that, but he’d better bring a lot more ammo.”', 'What I can say for sure is that the entire company is leaking like sieve and that the Trump White House has a tighter press ship. Which brings us back to the beginning — if Uber wants to move forward, it had better lose that meme and get back to building the kind of company its employees so desperately want to.', 'Said one of those top execs to me tonight: “When is this going to stop, so we can do our jobs?”', 'It’s a very good question for the Uber board. Whether they can do their only real duty as directors — hiring a CEO — and make that happen soon is unclear.', 'One silver lining: Anthony Scaramucci is currently busy with another gig.', '—By Kara Swisher, Re/code.net.

It has played a big part in pushing  up the firm’s total energy bill by 70 percent over the last five  years, to nearly half a billion euros.', '  It’s a different story across the Atlantic in the U.S. state of  Louisiana. There, chemicals maker Huntsman Corp pays 22 percent  less for its power than it did just seven years ago.', '  The tale of those numbers underlines a profound shift underway in  two of the world’s biggest industrial powers. Thanks in large  part to Germany’s decision to phase out nuclear power and push  into green energy, companies there now pay some of the highest  prices in the world for power. On average, German industrial  companies with large power appetites paid about 0.15 euros  ($0.21) per kilowatt hour (kWh) of electricity last year,  according to Eurostat, the European Union’s statistics agency.', '  In the United States, electricity prices are falling thanks to  natural gas derived from fracking - the hydraulic fracturing of  rock. Louisiana now boasts industrial electricity prices of just  $0.055 per kWh, according to U.S. Energy Information  Administration data.', 'Read MoreEurope sufferingfrom a lack of energy: Report', '  Peter Huntsman, chief executive of the family firm, calls the  United States the new global standard for low-cost manufacturing.  Huntsman is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to expand in  the United States, and rapidly closing plants in Europe. The  company estimates that a large, modern petrochemical plant in the  United States is $125 million cheaper to run per year than in  Europe. That sum includes cheaper power, waste disposal and  myriad other factors, and Huntsman said the contrast is similar  for Asian plants.', '  “It’s not a question of whether other countries are competitive  or not,” Huntsman, brother of former U.S. presidential candidate  Jon, said in an interview. “They’re not.”', '  Power isn’t the only reason the United States is becoming so  attractive to manufacturers again. Average labor costs in China  have more than doubled since 2007 to around $2 per hour, while  they’ve risen less in the United States to around $18 per hour,  with worker productivity far higher in the United States,  according to U.S. government statistics. When you factor in the  cost of shipping goods from Asia, it’s little wonder that America  has re-emerged as one of the most competitive places to build  stuff.', '  That’s a dramatic change from just a few years ago, when Germany  was held up as a model of manufacturing prowess. As recently as  2011, politicians in Washington were openly discussing how to  copy Germany’s success.', '  “We need to be more like Germany,” General Electric Chief  Executive Jeffrey Immelt said in an interview that year with  Reuters.', '  Now things are heading the other way. German Chancellor Angela  Merkel’s energy policies - designed to sharply boost the share of  renewables in Germany’s energy mix, tackle climate change and cut  Germany’s dependency on foreign gas and oil - are a rising source  of concern for the country’s industry, particularly  energy-intensive companies like Wacker. According to Germany’s  Chamber of Commerce and Industry, half of the country’s  industrial companies believe their global competitiveness is  threatened by Germany’s energy policy, and a quarter of them are  either shifting production abroad or considering doing so. The  United States is among the top destinations.', '  In March, BMW, the world’s largest luxury carmaker, said it would  invest $1 billion to expand its plant in Spartanburg, South  Carolina, making it the German group’s biggest production  facility by 2016. In all, German companies invested more than 800  billion euros in U.S. expansions between 2008 and 2012, according  to the most recent Bundesbank statistics. Germany’s Chamber of  Commerce and Industry reckons that investments could reach 200  billion euros in 2014, an all-time high.', '  “In the energy-intensive sectors, such as chemicals, we are  facing substantial challenges that will prevail for a longer  time,” said Carsten Rolle, head of energy and climate policy at  the Federation of German Industries (BDI). “It isn’t sudden but a  creeping process with new investment going more often to the  United States and other places abroad, where energy costs are  much lower.”', 'Read MoreUS manufacturingis coming back—Thank shale', ' A big bet', '  Wacker, which had sales of 4.5 billion euros last year, is one of  the German firms making the shift stateside. The company is  investing up to $2.4 billion in a new polysilicon plant in the  U.S. state of Tennessee. With 650 employees and capacity of at  least 20,000 tonnes a year, the plant will boost Wacker’s  capacity to make the material by nearly 40 percent. While the  company remains tight-lipped about its exact power costs in  Germany, analysts estimate that it will pay a third less for  electricity in Tennessee than in its main plant in Burghausen.', '  Wacker still employs about three quarters of its 16,800 workers  in Germany, but most of its capital spending has shifted outside  the country. Six years ago, the company spent 84 percent of its  investment budget at home. Last year that dropped to 37 percent.', '  And as energy prices rise, the group is eager to slash costs to  soften the blow.', '  In Germany, “we’re cutting corners wherever possible,” said  Christian Essers, in charge of the firm’s energy purchases. “But  at some point the steps to improve efficiency are getting smaller  while the effort to take them gets bigger.”', '  At Huntsman, which had 2013 revenues of $11.08 billion,  executives have begun paring down European production of basic  chemicals, which typically have small margins. In the last 18  months it has spent $100 million to close several plants and cut  more than 600 jobs in Europe.', '  Huntsman plans to close a Belgian plant this year that makes  chemicals used in detergents and soaps, blaming weak profits.', '  At its Geismar, Louisiana, plant, Huntsman is spending $78  million to boost production capacity of methylene diphenyl  diisocyanate (MDI), a chemical used to make insulations and other  common consumer goods. When the upgrade is finished early next  year, Geismar will be the largest MDI plant in North America.', '  That’s a far cry from five years ago, when Geismar was the most  expensive MDI plant in Huntsman’s portfolio, more expensive than  peers in the Netherlands and China. At times Huntsman was running  the Geismar plant far below its capacity because of the expense.', '  Cheap natural gas has changed all that.', '  “This facility can export product around the world to the  backyard of our competitors and still the product would be  cheaper, even with shipping,” said Huntsman.', '  At Port Neches, Texas, Huntsman is investing $125 million on an  expansion that, when finished in 2015, will make it the world’s  second-largest producer of ethylene oxide, a chemical crucial in  the production of carpet, clothing, soap and scores of other  consumer goods.', '  “We’re putting a big bet on the table, and in my opinion this  company has yet to take full advantage of the North American  shale story,” Huntsman told employees at its Geismar site during  a town hall meeting in April.', '  Fracking has allowed the global energy industry to access vast  new energy supplies. The process involves injecting sand, water  and chemicals at high pressures deep underground to break apart  shale rock, allowing oil and natural gas to escape. It first  became popular in the United States six years ago and has  produced a glut of natural gas in the country, pushing down  domestic prices for the fuel by about 61 percent in that  timeframe. That’s made it more appealing to use in electricity  generation. Now roughly a third of U.S. power plants employ it.', 'Read MoreGas price run-up may soon reverse course', '  Natural gas is also a key ingredient used to make chemicals, akin  to flour in a bakery. Automobile tires, for instance, are made  using styrene, a chemical which is derived from natural gas.', '  Cheap, plentiful natural gas has helped boost manufacturing’s  contribution to U.S. Gross Domestic Product by 15 percent since  2008, when fracking started to become popular. Natural gas made a  $2.08 trillion contribution to the U.S. manufacturing sector last  year alone.', '  Natural gas also helps plants power themselves through a process  known as cogeneration, the use of excess heat to generate power.', '  Huntsman’s Port Neches plant, for instance, produces all of its  electricity through cogeneration. Most new European plants, by  contrast, don’t use cogeneration due to regulations and a lack of  cheap natural gas to power generators, analysts say.', '  Huntsman pays about 80 percent more for electricity in Germany  than on the U.S. Gulf Coast, executives said.', '  “Germany is going to see the (negative) effect of its energy  policy three to five years down the road,” Huntsman said,  explaining that companies will gradually begin to move operations  out due to high power prices. “You won’t see this hurt the job  market right away.”', ' Energy shift', '  Germany’s high energy costs are rooted in aggressive new energy  standards which began during the last decade and are designed to  generate up to 60 percent of the nation’s electricity from wind  turbines, solar panels and other renewable sources by 2035, up  from 27 percent now.', '  The goal is to make Europe’s largest economy a leader in tackling  climate change, and to prove to other nations that a radical  overhaul of power markets can happen without too much financial  pain.', '  The accident at Japan’s Fukushima nuclear plant in 2011  emboldened Berlin in its goals, leading Chancellor Merkel to  accelerate a phase-out of nuclear power. Before Fukushima,  nuclear supplied about a quarter of Germany’s power; by 2022 it  will supply none.', '  This transformation, dubbed the “Energiewende” or energy shift,  has made Germany among the most expensive places in the world to  purchase electricity. The massive rise is not only due to the  payments made for solar power, but all other renewable energy  sources, most notably offshore and onshore wind parks, biogas and  geothermal plants. Costs are also ballooning due to the country’s  power taxes, which account for 14 percent of the total.', '  Some politicians have begun to worry about the increase. Economy  Minister Sigmar Gabriel warned in January that the power price  imbalance could cause a “dramatic de-industrialization” in the  country. Officials in his ministry say no issue worries him more  than Germany’s creeping loss of competitiveness.', '  “There is this great confidence that Germany is the bulwark of a  sick Europe, but now its industry is concerned about maintaining  that strength,” said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of consultancy  IHS and author of an influential history of the oil industry.', 'Read MoreGasprices shouldn’t be high, but are. Here’s why', '  “Germany faces a double whammy of rising energy costs in Germany  and falling energy costs in the United States,” he said.', '  Fracking has been controversial around the world due to the  mixture of chemicals and sand injected deep in the earth. It has  been blamed in parts of the United States for water  contamination, earthquakes and methane leaks, though direct  correlations have been hard to establish. Given these concerns,  it has received a cool reception in Europe.', '  Germany has not tapped its shale gas reserves, deterred by its  powerful renewable energy lobby, which has warned of the  environmental risks linked to fracking.', ' Economic laws', '  Generally speaking, power costs are less important than labor in  industry. But Wacker’s plant in Burghausen, on Germany’s border  with Austria, shows what’s at stake.', '  Founded a hundred years ago, the plant is now one of Germany’s  biggest industrial hubs, employing about 10,000 staff across an  area equal to some 460 soccer fields.', '  Each day, about 250 trucks and 100 train wagons transport goods  to and from the plant, where workers turn methanol, silicon,  ethylene and rock salt into more than 3,000 different products.', '  At Burghausen, Wacker makes polysilicon, one of its most  important products and one whose manufacturing process is  particularly energy-intensive. At one of the plant’s  high-security production sites, several cylinder-shaped ovens  quietly hum. A lava-like glow emanates from the small windows.  Temperatures of more than 1,000 degrees Celsius (1,832 degrees  Fahrenheit) are needed over long periods of time to make  polysilicon hyper-pure, as clients demand for solar cells.', '  Wacker Chemie’s bigger rival BASF has found an alternative way to  protect itself from rising power prices. BASF SE, the world’s  largest chemical company, generates much of its power in Germany  via cogeneration, but it gets the natural gas needed for the  plants from its own natural gas division in the North Sea. That  gives it a cost advantage.', '  The company, however, remains the exception, and the burden for  Germany’s industrial base will get bigger as more and more  renewables come online.', '  For Wacker, it’s an ironic twist of fate. It was a small  hydro-plant that helped it expand production in Burghausen after  World War One. A hundred years on, green energy sources are  forcing the group to look abroad when it thinks about the future.', '  “It’s the law of a free economy to start curbing production where  costs are higher,” Essers said.']"

Saudi Arabia is the world’s biggest exporter of crude, while Qatar is home to substantial natural gas resources.', 'But a diplomatic dispute will not necessarily threaten supplies. Amid a global glut, other countries could easily step in to fill the void, provided tensions in the region do not escalate.', 'More from New York Times: Trial will decide if ABC News sullied a company with ’pink slime’‘Wonder Woman’ could be the superhero women in Hollywood needA tax cut might be nice. But remember the deficit.', 'Investors seem to be making that calculus. While oil prices initially spiked 1.6 percent on Monday, the markets quickly fell back to just above $50 a barrel.', '“It is very difficult to see how this break in diplomatic relations would lead to a disruption of oil supplies,” said Paul Stevens, a Middle East oil specialist at Chatham House, a research organization in London.', 'Investors appear to be focused for now on the oversupply of oil, which has kept prices low for more than two years. Saudi Arabia and other major oil-exporting nations are trying to keep supplies in check, but American shale players continue to ramp up production.', 'Qatar, a member of  OPEC, helped broker last year’s agreement by the cartel and by other producers, like Russia,  to trim output in an effort to soak up supplies. Despite continuing political tensions, the parties  agreed last month to extend the cuts for nine months.', 'A small country with only 2.2 million residents — many of whom are not citizens — Qatar occupies a strategic position, jutting into the Persian Gulf from the Arabian Peninsula. Qatar has a border with Saudi Arabia and shares the world’s largest natural gas field with Iran.', 'Qatar is a relatively small oil producer with output of about 620,000 barrels a day in April, less than 1 percent of world supply. But Qatar the country is a world power in natural gas.', 'Through partnerships with Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Total and other companies, Qatar has built major infrastructure for chilling natural gas into liquid form so that it can be exported on ships. Qatar was the world’s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas last year, accounting for nearly 30 percent of supplies, according to the consultancy group Wood Mackenzie.', 'Gas has helped make Qatar one of the world’s richest countries. The government has used the steady flow of cash to intervene in regional disputes and to fund activities like the broadcast network Al Jazeera, actions that often annoy its Arab neighbors.', 'The diplomatic dispute has economic implications. Saudi Arabia has called for multinational companies to withdraw from Qatar, putting those firms in a difficult position. Major construction work is underway in preparation for Qatar’s hosting of the 2022 World Cup, for instance.', 'Disruptions of Qatar’s supplies would shake the natural gas market, but would not necessarily destabilize it. There are multiple sources of liquefied natural gas, including huge facilities developed recently in Australia, and companies are showing themselves increasingly willing and able to route cargoes to different ports according to need and price.', 'If the turmoil persists, it could threaten investment in oil and gas facilities. Even before the latest diplomatic moves against Qatar, tensions were high, stoked in part by the bitter differences between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and the fighting in Yemen and Iraq.', '“If this continues for any length of time it will have implications for the Qatari economy,” said Richard Mallinson, a geopolitical analyst at Energy Aspects, a market research firm. “The question is, do calmer heads prevail and do we see work to de-escalate.”']"
