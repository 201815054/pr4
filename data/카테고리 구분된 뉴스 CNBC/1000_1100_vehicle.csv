However, Biden’s approval increased among independents (33% in Q4, 42% now), which is in contrast to other recent public polling of Americans who don’t affiliate with either major party.', 'Along racial and ethnic lines, Biden’s approval rating is lowest among white business owners (NET -42), but he still gets high marks from Black small business owners (NET +22).', 'Biden’s overall approval from small business owners matches the 33% of owners who describe current business conditions as good.', 'The survey was conducted among over 2,000 small business owners across the U.S. before the outbreak of war in Ukraine. The war will be a dominant theme in the speech, but with oil prices hitting a seven-year high on Tuesday and wheat prices surging to a level not seen since 2008 as a result of the conflict, Biden will also be pressed to address the inflationary pressures that were already sweeping through the small business sector and impacting business decisions and confidence on Main Street.', 'The White House has been signaling that in addition to a focus on Russia and Ukraine, President Biden will use the speech to make his case for a strong economy, while acknowledging inflation.', '“As CNBC and NFIB surveys show, small business owners continue to struggle with economic headwinds including workforce shortages, rising inflation, and supply chain disruptions with little relief in sight,” said Kevin Kuhlman, director of government relations at NFIB. “Early materials and messaging appear that President Biden will acknowledge the challenges of inflation,” he said, but he added that NFIB remains worried about policy proposals including paid family and medical leave mandates and federal minimum wage hikes, which could further pressure small businesses, and continued focus on union-friendly legislation.', 'The White House highlighted paid leave mandates, a higher minimum wage, as well as its support for the labor union-supported Pro Act in an outline of economic priorities on Monday.', '“Things have changed dramatically on the international front, which raises the stakes even more for the President at home,” said Karen Kerrigan, president & CEO of the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council. “At a critical time such as this, our President needs the confidence and support of the American people behind him.”', 'For the small business community, she said, this means a speech that addresses priority concerns like inflation, health care and healing the economy rather than major tax or regulatory policies that will drive costs higher or fuel inflation further for small businesses. ', '“The American people will hear a lot about how he’s going to lower their costs, how he’s going to continue to build a strong economy over the long term,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in an MSNBC interview this week.', '“We’ve seen and heard from members about squeezes in supply chains and more corporate concentration further stifling supply chains and driving up prices,” said Didier Trinh, the director of policy and political Impact for the progressive small business trade group Main Street Alliance.', 'He cited shippers as one example of an issue where Biden can reach out to small business, and the president is expected to highlight efforts to target the shipping industry. Trinh said tax fairness and a focus on large corporations remain an issue where progress is also possible to benefit small businesses.', '“Small businesses are maybe not in an emergency situation like a year ago, but they are far from fully recovered,” Trinh said.', 'He and other small business experts cited support for small business health-care costs related to the Affordable Care Act legislation and tax credits as another area for bipartisan cooperation.', 'An increasing number (47%) of small business owners are raising their prices to offset increases in the costs of supplies, and more (32%) plan to do so if inflation remains elevated, which is their expectation, according to the survey. Over 80% of small business owners expect inflation to still be a problem six months from now (55% say that is “very likely”), while just 28% of small business owners are confident in the Federal Reserve’s ability to control inflation.', 'Overall, 31% of small business owners say inflation is the biggest risk to their business now, topping supply chain disruptions (23%), Covid-19 (20%), and labor shortages (12%).', 'President Biden’s attempt to highlight a strong economy was outlined in an administration fact sheet posted ahead of the address and which emphasized that “entrepreneurship and business investment rebounded, the economy achieved its fastest job growth in American history, the fastest economic growth in nearly 40 years,” and that there was a “historic shift from the old, outdated trickle-down approach to one that centers on workers, families, and small businesses.”', 'But inflation remains the polling issue that dominates over broader economic gains.', '“Inflation is an issue no incumbent administration wants in the headlines because they get blamed for it and can’t control it, certainly not in the short term,” said Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll. “It is also a great issue for the opposition party since no one likes inflation, they don’t have to have a specific ‘cure’ for it, and they can blame the incumbents.” ', 'Jeff Jones, Gallup senior editor, said its data shows varying economic sentiment depending on the specific issue, such as jobs and the stock market, but overall views of the economy have turned more negative since inflation became a greater concern. “The job market is right up there with the best we’ve ever seen, so it is definitely a positive ... but it looks to me like inflation is overshadowing everything else,” Jones said.', '“Inflation is an effective issue for Republicans to seize upon to think ill of Biden while Democrats downplay it. But independents are quite concerned and that is a problem for Biden and for Democratic candidates,” Franklin said.', 'Although independent small business owners in the CNBC|SurveyMonkey poll were slightly more positive quarter-over-quarter on Biden (though still expressing majority disapproval), the most recent Quinnipiac poll released in mid-February found inflation topped the list of the “most urgent issues” facing the country, at 27%, and that independents were more closely aligned with Republicans on this issue. Among Republicans, 36% cited inflation, versus 13% of Democrats who cited inflation as the top concern. But among independents, inflation was also the top issue, at 32%.The Quinnipiac survey also found a majority of Americans expecting Russia to start a war.', 'The Quinnipiac polling finds that 6 in 10 Americans feel the economy is getting worse, even though the majority describe their financial condition as good or excellent. Nearly three-quarters, 72%, say increased prices on food and gas have caused them to change spending habits.', 'In its polling, more than half of independents say they disapprove of the way Biden is handling his job. His overall approval rating in the Quinnipiac survey of 35% in February was consistent with approval ratings since October, which was the first time Quinnipiac saw Biden’s approval rating dip below 40%. “It hasn’t been able to get up above since then and independents are not helping those numbers,” said Mary Snow, Quinnipiac polling analyst.', 'Similar to the CNBC survey, Biden’s approval rating on the economy in the Quinnipiac poll (33%) was the lowest it has been since he took office.', '“It is up to him to re-set his policies and political strategy by working across the aisle and to govern as a moderate like he said he would when he ran for office,” Kerrigan said.', 'To learn more and to sign up for CNBC’s Small Business Playbook event, click here.']"
1,Walmart kicks off exclusive sales event to try to win and retain Walmart+ members,2022-02-24T17:45:38+0000,"['Walmart is giving customers a new reason to sign up and stick with the subscription service Walmart+: exclusive deals on items from air fryers to exercise bikes.', 'The sales event, which kicks off Thursday, is part of the retailer’s strategy to expand the program and turn customers into more frequent shoppers and bigger spenders. Walmart+ is also seen by the company as a lever it can pull to boost its e-commerce business and better compete with Amazon as it builds on recent growth during the pandemic.', 'Walmart’s e-commerce sales in the U.S. rose 11% in the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, and soared 90% on a two-year basis. Online sales account for roughly a third of all of Walmart’s sales in the U.S., according to the company’s financial filings.', 'The big-box retailer launched Walmart+ in September 2020. The program costs $98 a year, or $12.95 on a monthly basis, and includes perks like fuel and prescription discounts, free delivery of grocery orders of $35 or more, and free shipping for online purchases.', 'Since the program’s debut, however, Walmart has shared few details about the program’s performance — including its subscriber count.', 'Market researcher Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates a subscriber count of 11.5 million as of Jan. 31, based on its quarterly consumer surveys and industry research. That’s a fraction of the size of Amazon Prime, which debuted in 2005 and counts an estimated 172 million members in the U.S., according to CIRP.', 'About one in four Walmart.com shoppers are Walmart+ members, according to CIRP’s estimates.', 'Walmart CEO Doug McMillon has declined to give financial updates on Walmart+ during earnings calls, saying only that the retailer is focused on delivering a great customer experience and adding more membership benefits.', 'Last summer, Walmart tapped Chris Cracchiolo, a veteran of American Express, to lead the membership program, and it has added automation to dozens of stores to crank up capacity for online grocery orders, one of the program’s key perks.', 'With the sales event this week, Walmart is riffing off of a strategy used by Amazon Prime — but on a smaller scale. Amazon has thrown its exclusive sales event, Prime Day, since 2015, and it has become a popular sales holiday.', 'Walmart’s sales event will last for three weeks, with a rotating mix of items that are up to 40% off. On Thursday, the company’s website highlighted deals on items such as car seats and tires, with exclusive access to buy hot products like the Sony PlayStation 5 video game console.', 'The retailer has had other special deals for Walmart+ members, including giving them early access to Black Friday deals and exclusive access to gaming consoles on Cyber Monday this past holiday season.', 'Mike Levin, a partner and co-founder of CIRP, said Walmart’s reasons for boosting the service are clear: Those who sign up for membership programs buy more.', 'In the holiday quarter, for example, the average Walmart+ member spent $79 per visit to the website, according to CIRP. They also reported shopping an average of 29 times per year on the retailer’s website.', 'The average Walmart.com customer spent about $62 per visit in the three-month period and reported online shopping an average of 18 times per year, CIRP found.', 'Plus, Levin added, similar to members of warehouse clubs like Costco and Walmart-owned Sam’s Club, subscribers are “paying for the privilege” — creating another revenue stream for companies and an incentive for customers to go to stores and websites to get their money’s worth.', '“They’re just there a lot more often,” he said. “That’s like a fantasy for retailers.”']"
2,Amazon’s $21 billion Rivian stake is a bet that innovation can help solve climate change,2021-11-13T14:02:47+0000,"['Amazon’s big bet on Rivian Automotive paid off this week when the electric vehicle start-up made an explosive debut on the public markets.', 'Rivian raised nearly $12 billion in the mammoth offering and landed a lofty valuation of more than $110 billion, higher than auto giants GM and Ford. The IPO resulted in a massive windfall for Amazon, which invested more than $1.3 billion in Rivian. Amazon’s 20% stake in the business is now worth more than $21 billion.', 'Rivian’s IPO was a huge success for Amazon financially. It’s also key to one of the company’s most challenging mandates — to cut the amount of damage it does to the environment.', 'Amazon has long been criticized for not moving fast enough to address its environmental footprint. More than 1,000 Amazon employees walked out in 2019 to urge it to do more to combat climate change, after submitting a shareholder proposal signed by thousands of employees.', 'In 2019, Amazon founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos stood on stage to unveil a sweeping plan to transform the company’s climate policies and vowed that Amazon would be carbon neutral by 2040. He also announced that Amazon was placing an order for 100,000 electric last-mile delivery vans from Rivian to be delivered by 2030. Amazon hopes to have 10,000 of them on the road as early as next year.', 'Those goals are largely at odds with Amazon’s current reality. As the nation’s largest online retailer, Amazon delivers more than 10 billion items worldwide annually using an extensive network of gas-guzzling planes, vans, trucks and ships. It’s brought more of its transportation operations in house and dotted the country with warehouses in its quest to speed up deliveries from two days to increasingly one-day and, in some cases, within hours of an order being placed.', 'Bezos has previously said that same-day or one-day deliveries can lead to decreased emissions by reducing dependence on planes, while locating warehouses closer to customers means delivery vans can make shorter trips when dropping off packages, according to The Washington Post.', 'Transportation remains the biggest source of climate pollution in the U.S., accounting for 29% of the country’s total greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.', 'Last year, as the e-commerce giant’s business got a pandemic-fueled jolt, so did its carbon emissions, which climbed 19%. Emissions per dollar of merchandise declined by 16% in 2020.', 'For Amazon to make progress on its decarbonization efforts, it’ll need to keep investing in and implementing new transportation technologies. One way it’s already doing this is through the $2 billion Climate Pledge Fund, which Amazon uses to invest in start-ups developing technology that can help advance its climate goals.', 'Amazon’s acquisition of Zoox last year for more than $1 billion in part represents another bet on electrification. Zoox has built an all-electric, fully autonomous vehicle that’s built for ride hailing.', 'The company has been testing prototypes of its self-driving vehicle in San Francisco and Foster City in California, Las Vegas and, as of last month, Seattle. The company has also set up an office in Seattle, though Zoox and Amazon still continue to operate separately.', 'In the future, both Rivian vans and Zoox’s self-driving vehicles could fit into Amazon’s sprawling logistics network, by making the process of hauling and delivering goods cheaper, faster and more environmentally friendly.', 'But running on electricity is not necessarily a necessity for Zoox, said Bilal Zuberi, a partner at Lux Capital.', '“They could have a vehicle with a combustible engine or it could also be an electric vehicle,” Zuberi said. Amazon’s primary strategy behind investing in Rivian was to “be ahead of and have a piece of” the coming wave of electric vehicles, he added.', 'It’s unclear if autonomous vehicles have a meaningful environmental impact. Proponents of the technology say self-driving cars will reduce traffic congestion and facilitate the growth of ride-sharing services, which could mean people take fewer trips in their own cars. Others have argued self-driving cars could lead to more people using automobiles to get around, generating greater pollution.', 'Amazon has made other weighty bets in autonomous vehicles. The company in 2019 invested in self-driving car start-up Aurora as part of a $530 million funding round.', 'Earlier this year, Amazon placed an order for 1,000 autonomous driving systems from self-driving truck start-up Plus and, as part of the deal, was given the option to purchase a 20% stake in Plus. It has also tested hauling goods on self-driving trucks made by Embark.', '″[Amazon] is seeing that we’re in the very early innings of a multi-decade transformation in mobility and autonomous is going to be a huge part of that, as is electric,” said Asad Hussain, senior mobility analyst at financial data company Pitchbook. “So I think Amazon is sort of hedging its bets on all of this innovation going on and making sure they’re getting the exposure where they can in areas where, maybe in the future, it will help their core businesses.”', 'Amazon has also developed its own Scout delivery robot, which is a small six-wheeled electric vehicle. And it’s increasingly adding more micro-mobility delivery options in dense, urban areas, like electric cargo delivery bikes.', 'Amazon’s interest in decarbonization isn’t limited to its transport systems on the ground.', 'In May, Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund invested in Beta Technologies, which is building an electric aircraft, as part of a $368 million funding round. Amazon has also backed start-ups developing hydrogen-powered planes and net-zero carbon diesel and jet fuels.', 'Amazon, which has a massive ocean shipping operation, last month agreed to switch to zero-carbon fuels for ocean freight by 2040.']"
3,These smart glasses offer a glimpse at the future Apple and Facebook are planning,2021-11-20T15:00:01+0000,"['I recently tried a pair of prototype smart glasses from Avegant that gave me a glimpse of a future where we may be able to watch videos, get directions, see notifications and more, all through a pair of traditional-looking shades.', 'These sorts of glasses may be the next big thing as companies like Facebook, Snap, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and others look beyond phones.', 'I’ve worn Google Glass, the Microsoft Hololens, Snap’s Spectacles and, most recently, Facebook’s Ray-Ban Stories glasses. But those all have shortcomings. They’re either too big and bulky to wear everywhere (Hololens), don’t yet display anything on the lenses (Facebook) or look silly (Spectacles, Hololens, Google Glass.)', 'Big Tech companies will need smart glasses to look normal if they’re to have any chance at success. So they’re desperately looking for a display component that is small and can be manufactured and shipped in the next year or two, Avegant CEO Edward Tang told CNBC. ', 'Avegant doesn’t make smart glasses, but it put together a prototype pair to demonstrate the capabilities of a new LED augmented-reality light engine that the company unveiled to the public this fall. And I was impressed.', 'Here’s what you need to know.', 'A lot of companies are building smart glasses, but they’re all taking different approaches. It’s sort of a mess. Here’s a quick recap:', 'Avegant thinks it has a solution that might help companies build a product regular people will want to buy.', 'Its new light engine, which is thinner than a pencil and weighs as much as a large paper clip, fits within the hinge and temple of eyeglasses where it can show high-definition visuals to the wearer. The light engine could enable some companies that don’t have huge in-house hardware engineering teams to build glasses that are as stylish and small as a pair of Ray-Bans but offer the visual capabilities dreamed up in science fiction films like “Terminator.”', 'I demoed the light engine in October when Tang handed me the prototype glasses his team built. They were thin and looked like any normal pair of glasses except that they were tethered to a smartphone by a cable. The prototype is intended to demonstrate just how small a hardware manufacturer can make a pair of glasses using Avegant’s light engine.', '“We’re getting our stuff ready to have the smallest manufacturable display for these customers,” Tang said. ', 'I put the glasses on. A translucent blue square came on at the center of my field of view, showing a display that was overlaid on top of what I was seeing in real life. Then the demo started. ', 'The glasses began to cycle through different visuals. The small translucent screen showed me the weather, a stock chart and a text message conversation. I was looking in the direction of Tang and could see him, but the visuals also appeared on top of him in crystal clarity. It was true augmented reality. ', 'The highlight of the demo was when the glasses began to play a video. It was a snippet of a soccer match from this summer’s Euro 2020 tournament. I saw the green grass, the vast crowd and the players passing the ball to one another before the forward blasted a goal into the back of the net. The game looked as good and as big as it would if I was watching at home on my living room TV or sitting with friends at a sports bar.', 'The Avegant light engine offers a 30-degree field of view and appeared like a rectangle in the middle of my line of sight.', 'I handed the pair of glasses back to Tang, who put them on and began watching the demo. I could hardly tell he was watching anything, though I noticed a subtle hint of blue light on the lens. It appeared as if he was daydreaming.', 'But there are still drawbacks. Manufacturers who use the Avegant light engine will have to determine how much battery life they want their smart glasses to have. The more battery life, the bulkier the glasses will be. Likewise, a 30-degree field of view is on a par with the first Hololens, but it’s a smaller window than Microsoft’s Hololens 2.', 'Components like Avegant’s may help some tech companies develop smart glasses people will want to wear. But it’s still early days and skeptics don’t think we’ll have normal-looking smart glasses anytime soon.', '“The long-term vision here is to get rid of your phone in your hand, and you’ll wear your phone on your face,” Kevin Irwin, chief investment officer at Knollwood Investment, said. Irwin is an investor in Avegant. ', 'Avegant isn’t yet mass-producing its light engine. It envisions a business model in which it will sell the component to companies that can build it into their smart glasses.', 'Larger companies may not even need Avegan’ts technology, explained Karl Guttag, an expert on augmented reality display devices.', '“Facebook and Apple are ground-up companies — they’ve got phenomenal, huge teams working on this stuff,” Guttag said. “They don’t need an Avegant, if you get my drift, whereas a Snap might because they’re not really in this. They’d be looking to get a component.”', 'Guttag also has his doubts about smart glasses replacing smartphones anytime in the near future, which would limit Avegant’s prospects. ', '“The expectation that these things are going to be like Ray-Bans is off the chart far away,” Guttag said. “Now something like what Avegant’s engine does could get you something that is moderately stylish. It’s going to be a little bigger and bulkier but not all the way there.”']"

Americans — including millennials, the country’s largest generation — have been buying houses and upgrading to bigger ones during the coronavirus pandemic. That has depleted the supply of available homes and inspired some to hire contractors to redo a bathroom, replace a roof or take on other similar projects.', 'Those dynamics have lifted sales for Lowe’s and competitor Home Depot.', '“When home prices go up, consumers have confidence to invest in their homes,” Lowe’s CEO Marvin Ellison said Wednesday morning on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”', 'He said repair and maintenance projects will drive spending, even as prices rise from inflation and a mortgage rate hike looms. About half of the country’s single-family homes were built before 1980, according to data from the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. ', 'Here’s what Lowe’s reported for the quarter ended Jan. 28 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:', 'In the fourth quarter, Lowe’s net income rose to $1.21 billion, or $1.78 per share, from $978 million, or $1.32 per share, a year earlier. The results were above the $1.71 expected by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.', 'Sales climbed to $21.34 billion from $20.31 billion last year and outpaced analysts’ expectations of $20.90 billion.', 'Lowe’s same-store sales in the U.S. increased 5.1% in the fourth quarter, as customers made fewer trips to the company’s website and stores but spent more when they did.', 'Ellison said in a separate interview that a year ago the mix of purchases looked different as shoppers bought cleaning products and supplies for simple do-it-yourself projects. Now, major projects are driving a larger share of purchases.', 'Transactions in the U.S. fell 4.4% in the fourth quarter compared with the year-ago period. Ellison said sales of big-ticket items that cost at least $500 grew 15.6% in the quarter. The average ticket at U.S. stores and on Lowe’s website rose 9.5% to $95.66 in the fourth quarter, partially due to inflation.', 'Sales from home professionals jumped 23% in the three-month period, too. The pros tend to be steadier and more lucrative customers.', 'Lowe’s has historically drawn about 20% to 25% of its total sales from pros compared with Home Depot, which gets about half of its sales from them. Lowe’s has been chasing pros, however, with a new loyalty program and perks like reserved parking and free air for tires at its stores.', 'Pro sales are growing for another reason, too. As the omicron variant recedes and schedules get busier again, some people are hiring contractors rather than taking on DIY projects.', 'Like other retailers, Lowe’s is seeing costs rise and chasing inventory due to supply chain delays. Inflation drove about half of Lowe’s sales increase in the second half of the year, Ellison said.', 'In some categories, such as appliances, he said Lowe’s has expanded its portfolio of merchandise, so shoppers have a wider variety if an item is out of stock.', '“You may not get the exact brand you want, but if you’re looking for a stainless steel, French door refrigerator, we’re going to have that model for you,” he said. “It just may not be in the specific brand that you wanted when you came in.”', 'Ellison said the retailer is working closely with suppliers, sourcing more products from the U.S. and importing inventory from other countries. It opened coastal holding distribution centers on the East and West coasts where it can store products from other parts of the globe rather than ordering just in time — an approach that can help retailers’ balance sheets, but make them vulnerable if ports are temporarily shuttered or congested.', 'He said Lowe’s already has its inventory in the U.S. as it gears up for spring, its busiest season. As the weather warms, it will ship merchandise from the coastal holding facilities to regional distribution centers and then stores.', '“It’s an extra step, but that extra step has given us the ability to have a better in-stock position than most of our competitors,” he said.', 'The retailer said it expects earnings per share to range from $13.10 to $13.60 on revenue of $97 billion to $99 billion in fiscal 2022. It had previously forecast earnings per share of $12.94 on revenue of $97 billion for the year, which is a week longer than fiscal 2021.', 'It said same-store sales will range from a decline of 1% to an increase of 1% for the full year.', 'As of Tuesday’s close, Lowe’s shares are up 27% over the past 12 months. The stock closed Tuesday at $214.59, bringing Lowe’s market value to $144.58 billion.', 'Read the company’s earnings press release here.', 'Correction: Ellison said sales of big-ticket items that cost at least $500 grew 15.6% in the quarter.

It already halted production of its more expensive Bike+ in December and will do so until June. It won’t manufacture its Tread treadmill machine for six weeks, beginning next month. And it doesn’t anticipate producing any Tread+ machines in fiscal 2022, according to the documents. Peloton had previously halted Tread+ production after a safety recall last year.', 'The company said in a confidential presentation dated Jan. 10 that demand for its connected fitness equipment has faced a “significant reduction” around the world due to shoppers’ price sensitivity and amplified competitor activity.', 'Peloton has essentially guessed wrong about how many people would be buying its products, after so much demand was pulled forward during the coronavirus pandemic. It’s now left with thousands of cycles and treadmills sitting in warehouses or on cargo ships, and it needs to reset its inventory levels.', 'The planned production halt comes as close to $40 billion has been shaved off of Peloton’s market cap over the past year. Its market value hit a high of nearly $50 billion last January.', 'Peloton shares closed Thursday down 23.9% at $24.22, bringing the stock’s market value to $7.9 billion. During trading, shares hit a 52-week low of $23.25. The drop also brought the stock below $29, where it was priced ahead of Peloton’s initial public offering.', 'The company’s presentation shows Peloton had initially set expectations on Oct. 31 for demand and deliveries in its fiscal third quarter and fourth quarter that ended up being far too high. It reevaluated those forecasts on Dec. 14, according to the presentation, and Peloton’s expectations dropped significantly for its Bike, Bike+ and Tread.', 'However, Peloton said, the latest forecast doesn’t take into account any impact to demand the company might see when it begins to charge customers an extra $250 in delivery and setup fees for its Bike, and another $350 for its Tread, beginning at the end of this month.', 'Peloton also said it has seen low email capture rates for the upcoming debut of its $495 strength training product, Peloton Guide, which is codenamed “Project Tiger” in internal documents viewed by CNBC. Email capture rates keep track of the number of people who enter their email addresses on Peloton’s website to receive information on the product. The company said this is a signal of “a more challenging post-Covid demand environment.”', 'The official launch of Guide in the U.S. was pushed from last October to next month and now could come as late as April, the presentation dated earlier this month said. The company also said it initially planned to charge $595 for the bundle that includes one of Peloton’s heart rate arm bands and later dropped the price by $100.', 'Late Thursday, Chief Executive Officer John Foley said in a statement, “As we discussed last quarter, we are taking significant corrective actions to improve our profitability outlook and optimize our costs across the company. This includes gross margin improvements, moving to a more variable cost structure, and identifying reductions in our operating expenses as we build a more focused Peloton moving forward.” ', 'Foley added that Peloton will have more to share when it reports its fiscal second-quarter results on Feb. 8 after the market closes. ', 'A little more than a year ago, Peloton was facing the exact opposite issue. It had too much demand and not nearly enough supply. In December 2020, it announced a $420 million acquisition of the exercise equipment manufacturer Precor, giving it more than 625,000 square feet of production space. That deal closed early last year.', 'Then, last May, Peloton said it would be spending another $400 million to build its first factory in the United States to speed up production of its cycles and treadmills. That facility in Ohio isn’t expected to be up and running until 2023.', 'In recent months, though, gyms have reopened and consumers don’t appear to be throwing as much money into at-home fitness equipment. At the end of its latest quarter, Peloton counted 2.49 million connected fitness subscribers. It only added about 161,000 net new members in the period ended Sept. 30, its lowest growth in two years.', 'The reversal is seen in its stock price. Pelton shares rallied more than 440% in 2020, but dropped 76% in 2021.', 'In a separate internal Peloton presentation dated October 2021, which was obtained by CNBC, Peloton said that it was expecting overall fitness spending would continue to grow year over year, but instead overall spending was flat following the summer months.', 'Analysts in recent weeks have been trimming their expectations for Peloton’s second quarter as well as their price targets for the stock, projecting that Peloton had a weak holiday.', 'One bright spot the presentation noted was that Peloton’s share of the total connected fitness market had been increasing.', 'But a report from research firm M Science shows that Peloton’s overall market share might be on the decline. In November, Peloton’s share of all connected fitness products priced at a minimum of $1,400 was tracking slightly below levels observed in 2019 and 2020, M Science said.

6,Three former SpaceX engineers are designing self-powered electric freight train cars,2022-01-19T17:08:38+0000,"['Three former SpaceX engineers are launching a company to design and build electric self-powered train cars, in a bid to improve efficiency and lower emissions in the freight rail system.', 'Freight trains are a lot more energy-efficient than trucking. Thanks in part to better aerodynamics, moving one unit of freight by train takes one-quarter the energy required to move it by truck, said CEO and founder Matt Soule told CNBC.', '“But because of how rail is architected, it has its operational and economic limits,” said Soule . “But if you can break through those barriers and allow rail to serve more of these markets — that’s the opportunity.”', 'Moving the freight system from diesel to electric power could also play a major part in reducing the carbon emissions that cause global climate change. Transportation accounts for 29% of the total greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, according to a report issued by the Environmental Protection Agency in Dec. 2021. Almost a quarter of that comes from medium and heavy duty trucks.', '“We think it’s very relevant to focus on energy usage reduction,” Soule told CNBC.', 'Soule got the idea in an unusual way.', 'At SpaceX, where he started in 2006, Soule was the Head of Avionics, meaning “we made the electronics that made the rocket fly straight.” After he left in 2019, Soule was waiting to meet a friend, technologist and product designer Brian Ignaut, for coffee, and watching YouTube on his phone. The selection algorithm randomly served him a video on freight trains. That got him thinking about the potential in the freight train system and the need to reduce its carbon emissions.', 'By Thanksgiving 2019, the idea for the company was coming together, and in January 2020, Soule went on to launch the company two other SpaceX employees, John Howard and Ben Stabler. The trio kept mostly quiet about what they were doing until Wednesday, when they revealed the company to the press and announced a $50 million funding round led by Anthos Capital.', 'The company is just in the prototype stage and has no customers or revenue yet. With the new round of funding, Parallel Systems, which was running on $3.6 million in seed funding, will build a fleet of rail vehicles, execute advanced testing programs, and grow the team.', 'So far, with its staff of about 25 engineers from tech companies like Google, Tesla, and Uber, Parallel Systems has built several prototypes and tested tested its first-generation vehicle on a closed track in the Los Angeles area.', 'The vehicles works in pairs. Each pair carries one standard shipping container — the same box that goes on flatbed trucks and gets loaded in and out of ships in port cities across the globe.', 'The cars carrying the containers are each self-powered, but the system will work best if the cars are linked together. So instead of having a long freight train powered by a few diesel locomotives, Parallel Systems envisions a “platoon” of 10 to 50 self-powered freight cars, Soule told CNBC.', 'That’s a lot shorter than traditional freight trains, which can run up to 200 cars or more. Today, freight trains favor length because the more a single train can haul, the cheaper the cost becomes to move each unit full of stuff. But parking and unloading them is a big chore, Soule told CNBC.', 'A very long train requires a very big train terminal for unloading and loading freight. That can be a problem because ports and places where freight is loaded are often in urban areas, like Los Angeles, where land and space are at a premium.', 'Autonomous train platoons could improve train terminal logistics and lower those costs.', '“Since the vehicles self-position under the crane and self-clear, the terminal dwell time and required land capacity is much smaller,” explained Dean Wise, a former vice president of network strategy at BNSF Railway who advises the company.', 'Making the cars electric does not necessarily make the system totally green -- it depends on how the electricity that powers that part of the grid is created, as Soule readily admits.', 'But an electric rail car at least has the potential to emit zero greenhouse gases, while diesel trains will always emit some.', 'Moreover, because electric rail vehicles use 25% as much energy as a long-haul truck, their batteries only need 25% of the storage capacity that would be required for a long-haul electric truck. Soule said the company hasn’t yet decided what kind of batteries to use, but is looking at storage technologies from the utility space.', 'For Soule, transitioning from his previous post at SpaceX means getting used to overseeing and moving forward the whole company and getting used to being a salesman.', 'But he says it’s been encouraging seeing industry veterans react to the prototypes, Soule said.', '“No matter how many PowerPoint presentations we give them, as soon as they come see it in person, you can see the lightbulb come on,” Soule said.', 'Wise says the former SpaceX engineers have latched on to an idea that others in the industry had been imagining.', '“At BNSF, we had brainstormed that a self-powered autonomous rail vehicle would be a game-changer, dramatically improving rail’s ability to compete with the highway, and defend against the looming challenge of autonomous trucks — now acknowledged by most as a matter of when, not if,” Wise told CNBC.', 'So far, Parallel Systems has had calls with 30 “major companies” in the space, including class one railroads, shortline rail holding companies, motor carriers, ocean carriers, ports, and industrial shippers, Wise said.', '“The clincher for me was that these conversations were universally positive and uncovered additional value, refinements, and potential applications, leading to several companies seeking strategic development partnerships and investment opportunities with Parallel,” said Wise.']"

We want a blue-water navy’ — of course, also to make power,” Schonbach told CNBC’s Martin Soong on “Squawk Box Asia” on Wednesday. A blue-water navy is one that can operate globally in open oceans and is not limited to near-shore functions.', '“The question is if they fit into the international rules-based order,” he said.', 'Schonbach made his comments as the German frigate Bayern is docked in Singapore. The Bayern arrived Monday as part of a six-month deployment to Asia-Pacific. It is sailing through the South China Sea, marking the first deployment of a German warship to the Indo-Pacific in almost 20 years.', 'China’s growing naval might has become a source of increasing concern for the United States as well as democracies in Europe and Asia.', 'According to a recent report on Chinese military power, the U.S. Department of Defense said China is the world’s biggest ship-producing nation and is nearly self-sufficient in those endeavors. It also expects China’s second domestically built aircraft carrier to enter service by 2024 and projects the country to maintain between 65 and 70 submarines by the mid-2020s.', 'Washington is concerned about Beijing’s moves in the South China Sea, as are countries that bound it including Vietnam and the Philippines. The South China Sea is massive, about 1.4 million square miles (3.5 million square kilometers), and contains some of the world’s most critical shipping lanes.', 'China claims most of the South China Sea as its own territory though other countries and an international ruling from the Hague have rejected those claims.', 'During a visit to the Indo-Pacific region last week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken called on China to cease its “aggressive actions” in the region.', '“Nowhere is the rules-based maritime order under greater threat than in the South China Sea,” Blinken said in July. “The People’s Republic of China (PRC) continues to coerce and intimidate Southeast Asian coastal states, threatening freedom of navigation in this critical global throughway.”', 'Germany’s deployment of the Bayern comes after the country issued policy guidelines on the Indo-Pacific region last year, which noted that European and Indo-Pacific economies “are closely connected through global supply chains.” Berlin also said in its announcement that if there are conflicts in the region that “adversely affect security and stability there, this has repercussions for Germany, too.”', 'Schonbach said the deployment is “like a teaser” and signals German commitment to step up engagement in Asia, including through expanding its security and defense cooperation with regional partners. ', '“We’re here for the first time after 19 years to check the battlefield,” he said. “Last year, the government of Germany promulgated the guidelines for the Indo-Pacific. This is now the first step. The next step, probably, I hope that we can come on a regular basis — two or three years.”']"

The company said it will offer competitively priced shipping within two hours as well as a two-day delivery option. The deliveries will be handled by a combination of associates, gig workers and at times other delivery companies.', 'Walmart is currently partnered with FedEx for online package delivery. The company would not say if FedEx would be used for GoLocal.', 'However, Ward said the company would tap innovative delivery partners, including Cruise, a self-driving electric vehicle start-up the retailer invested in last year, as well as Waymo and Nuro. Drone delivery will also be a focus, with partners including DroneUP, another company Walmart invested in last year, as well as ZipLine and FlyTrex.', '“What we’re excited about is that as we scale this, we’ve got all these different disruptive technologies that bring in the last mile work together at Walmart,” Ward said.', 'Walmart has spent the past five years building its ability to deliver goods to customers. In August 2016, it acquired e-commerce start-up Jet.com for $3.3 billion. In March 2018, Walmart launched its grocery delivery service, fulfilling orders from Walmart stores. The company launched Walmart Fulfillment Services in February 2020 to compete with the growth of marketplace-focused sites such as Amazon and Shopify.', 'The company discontinued Jet.com in May 2020, but CEO Doug McMillon credited the acquisition with helping Walmart grow its delivery network.', 'Amazon launched a similar service, called Amazon Shipping, in 2018, that was designed to compete with UPS and FedEx, but it suspended the service in June 2020.', 'Bernstein senior transportation analyst David Vernon said a local delivery service by a retailer would not be likely to have any significant impact on FedEx and UPS revenues.', '“The local delivery market has 230,000 companies that compete in every city across America,” Vernon told CNBC. “There are two national parcel networks.

', 'As government stimulus seeks to fuel a hyper recovery and the world economy accelerates over the rest of this year, the pressures on supply chains are increasing and disruptions are likely to grow as we head into summer.', 'Global prosperity over the last several decades has been built on the ever-more-complicated and intricate system of supply chains that tie raw material suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and consumers together.', 'The most recent IHS Markit global survey of manufacturers finds that the “stretching of supply chains” over the last year has extended delivery times to levels “unsurpassed in over 20 years of data availability.”', 'With stimulus dollars flowing, the pressures will increase as consumers come out of lockdowns with pent-up demand as well as a lot of liquidity -- the household savings rate is now 18 percent compared to the normal 7 percent.   ', 'Three disruptions have converged at the same time – in shipping, in computer chips, and in plastics. Each of these chains are among the most important foundations of the modern economy.', ' The granular data tracked by  IHS Markit - in shipping, chemicals, automotive, and economics  - demonstrates the extent of the disruptions.', 'The great boiler room of today’s globalization is containerization. ', 'The massive container ships - about 5,400 altogether - ply the oceans, carrying to the world’s markets at any given time about 20 million containers, filled with everything from tennis shoes and anti-virus masks to laptop computers, auto parts, and  solar panels.', 'Asia is the source of much of the goods, most notably China, home to seven of the 10 largest container ports in the world. ', 'The turmoil in shipping began early in 2020 when the pandemic shut China down for two months.  That meant the evaporation of expected shipments of goods to the rest of the world.  As China recovered, North America and Europe shut down.', ' With people stuck in their homes, their spending on such services as travel plummeted, while spending on electronics, home furnishings, and many other goods shot up.  That, combined with the urgent need for medical supplies and protective gear to fight the pandemic,  meant a swelling flotilla of container ships sailing towards the United States.', 'The adjacent ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which handle half of total U.S. imports from Asia, have been overwhelmed, with no slack time to catch up on the backlog. The congestion was made worse by the restriction and distancing that Covid has placed on work schedules.', 'Huge container ships continue to be stacked up outside those ports, unable to get to berths, meaning that goods are not being landed to meet the surging demand. ', 'A Federal Maritime Commissioner described the West Coast back-ups as “the worst we’ve ever seen.”', 'The impact can be measured in trade and shipping costs. Containerized shipping to the West Coast was 30 percent higher in February 2021, over 2020, and shipping rates from Asia to the East Coast , including surcharges, are up as much as five times over last year.', 'The shipping disruption has been further aggravated by an imbalance between where the containers are and where they are needed.', 'The second major disruption is of computer chips, which is hitting the auto industry.  This is made worse by the tangle in shipping.  But the main reason is the  surge in competing demand for computer chips for electronics and 5G and automobile industry, along with the overall rapid recovery in China. ', 'Then, as things happen, a major computer chip factory in Japan caught fire.  An extended drought in Taiwan, source of 60 percent the world’s chips by value, has created another crick in the supply chains, this for the pure water necessary for chip manufacture.', 'The “chip famine” continues to play havoc with auto manufacturing.  Today’s cars are also electronic devices that run on computer chips – and increasingly so.   Owing to the shortage of chips, the major automakers in North America, Europe, and China have had to temporarily halt some production. ', 'Even though chip manufacturers have announced new investment in capacity, this will take time; IHS Markit estimates that this shortage, at least for the auto industry, will persist into next year.', 'The weather instigated the third disruption.  Texas was hit by a deep freeze for which it was not operationally prepared.  The electricity supplies necessary to keep natural gas wells flowing were cut off, shutting down the gas production required to operate the power plants in the first place.  In a vicious circle, that meant still less electricity. Texas went dark.', 'The Texas petrochemical plants, which produce a substantial part of the world’s plastics, had to rush to implement emergency shutdowns to avoid accidents or lasting damage to the facilities.  These factories are coming back into operation, but slowly and with great care, and that will take many more weeks and then additional weeks to replenish supplies.', 'The result has been a widespread shortage of plastic materials that are used to make such things as furniture, mattresses, and car seats.  Alternative supplies that might be brought in from Asia are stuck in the same Pacific maritime traffic jam. No flexible foam means further shutdowns in auto plants. With fewer car seats, fewer cars to go to dealers.', 'Then the huge Ever Given container ship got caught sideways in the Suez Canal, blocking passage in that critical shortcut that saves 6000 miles in the journeys between Asia and Europe.  This added yet another level of disruption to global supply chains – jumbling schedules and pushing congestion up to what is called “critical levels” in  European ports already struggling with overload.', 'The interconnected pressure on supply chains is increasing as the economic recovery gains pace. Manufacturing of all kinds will be hampered by shortages in the months ahead.  Port congestion will disrupt the complex flows of auto components.  Trucking , which picks up the containers at ports, is stretched to the limit in the United States.', ' “I’ve never before seen a situation where every sector of the [transportation] industry is slammed,” is the way one trucking executive put it. Meanwhile, the shortage of computer chips is impeding the manufacture of new trucks.', 'The global supply chains have been a great engine of economic growth, indeed essential to the performance of the world economy.  But they are now strained in a way that has never happened before.', ' The system will adjust, but it will take new investment in capacity and ports, and that will take time.  Companies will reexamine their sourcing strategies, seeking through diversity to reduce disruption risk, but that will add complexity.

And since small businesses do not tend to think of themselves as having pricing power over the long-term, if they are “becoming more emboldened” it is an indication that inflationary pressures are broader-based, he added.', 'The CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Confidence Index score continues to hover around all-time lows, holding at 44 out of 100, which was unchanged from Q4 2021 and nearly identical to the all-time low score of 43 from a year ago.

Launched out of “stealth” on Thursday, Worldcoin promises to hand out free cryptocurrency to people who verify their accounts by taking an iris scan.', 'Worldcoin says it’s already attracted $25 million in funding from Silicon Valley investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Coinbase and billionaire LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, giving the firm a $1 billion valuation.', 'Altman, CEO of artificial intelligence group OpenAI and former president of start-up accelerator Y Combinator, co-founded the company with theoretical physics student Alex Blania and Max Novendstern, a former investment associate at Bridgewater Associates.', 'The idea seems outlandish at first. Free money? And all I need to do is have my eyes scanned? It sounds too good to be true.', 'However, Worldcoin’s founders say it’s about expanding the reach of cryptocurrencies — and financial services more broadly — to the masses. Less than 3% of the global population are crypto users, according to virtual currency exchange Crypto.com.', '“Cryptocurrency is a very powerful thing,” Blania, Worldcoin’s CEO, told CNBC. “It will widen the boundaries of the economy in general and give many people access.”', 'Worldcoin has already shipped its orb-shaped devices to people in 12 countries. Testers get users to sign up by having their iris scanned. The image is then encrypted and becomes a unique code, while the original data is deleted to protect users’ privacy. Following that, users are given a free share of Worldcoin’s cryptocurrency.', '“We designed the whole system to be fundamentally privacy-preserving,” Blania said. “The iris code itself is the only thing leaving the orb. There’s no big database of biometric data.”', 'The company has so far amassed over 100,000 users globally already, and is onboarding 700 more each week. Worldcoin aims to hit 1 billion users by 2023.', 'Which raises a big question — how exactly is Worldcoin meant to be used?', 'Well, one early feature of the project will be a digital wallet that lets users store their crypto and make payments. But more broadly, Blania hopes to attract developers who can build apps on top of its system; apps “that we don’t see today and that are really hard to build today because very few people hold crypto.”', '“Network effects are these very coveted things that are incredibly big,” Blania said.', '“You see this in Facebook. As soon as you suddenly have a billion people and everyday people holding something like that and using something like that, you as an entrepreneur can build completely new things.”', 'One issue Worldcoin encountered early on, Blania says, is ensuring that people aren’t able to cheat the system. He calls this problem “proof of person.”', '“The only solution for that problem, we found, was to build an orb,” Worldcoin’s boss said. “It’s the most secure and privacy-preserving way we found to prove everyone in the world is unique.”', 'It’s a concept that has parallels to a universal basic income, or UBI, which has been promoted by Altman and several other high-profile figures in tech.', 'The idea is that, by handing out cash regularly to citizens for free, governments can mitigate the impacts of artificial intelligence and automation on workers.', 'Blania hinted that Worldcoin could be used as the “infrastructure” to carry out UBI at some point in the future.”', '“I’m personally very excited about UBI over the long term,” Blania said. “I think it’s a very hard thing to implement right now.”', '“We see ourselves as building this huge network of people where entrepreneurs can jump in and build applications like this. UBI is one of those, but building big financial, global companies is another big one.”', 'Worldcoin isn’t the only far-out project Altman has thrown his weight behind. In 2018, the millionaire tech entrepreneur paid $10,000 to a start-up called Nectome to have his brain preserved, scanned and uploaded into a computer simulation.', 'Worldcoin has built its system on Ethereum, the blockchain network behind the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. Blania hopes to tap into a fast-growing trend in crypto known as decentralized finance, or DeFi, which seeks to cut the middlemen out of traditional financial processes like lending and investing.', 'Worldcoin’s launch comes at a time of renewed interest in cryptocurrencies as the prices of bitcoin and other digital coins have surged lately. Bitcoin, the world’s largest virtual currency, notched a fresh record high above $66,000 on Wednesday, while ether, XRP and other tokens also climbed sharply.', 'Cryptocurrencies have gained a reputation for their involvement in fraudulent activity, with various pump-and-dump schemes duping amateur investors into buying tokens, only for the creators and insiders to make off with millions. But Blania insists Worldcoin isn’t a scam.', '“We are extremely transparent about everything we do,” he said. “We will open source everything that is possible to open source.”']"

16,These 23-year-old Texans made $4 million last year mining bitcoin off flare gas from oil drilling,2022-02-12T15:15:01+0000,"['HOUSTON — When Brent Whitehead and Matt Lohstroh were sophomores at Texas A&M University, they decided to get into the business of mining bitcoin on the oil fields of East Texas. The year was 2019, and at the time, the idea of oil and gas companies joining forces with bitcoin miners was considered both avant-garde — and a major taboo.', 'But Whitehead, an engineer hailing from a family with a long history in oil and gas production, and Lohstroh, a finance major with a bitcoin obsession, ignored the skeptics, and sunk all the cash they had earned from their high school side gigs in lawn care and landscaping into Giga Energy Solutions, a company that mints bitcoin from stranded natural gas.', 'For years, oil and gas companies have struggled with the problem of what to do when they accidentally hit a natural gas formation while drilling for oil. Whereas oil can easily be trucked out to a remote destination, gas delivery requires a pipeline. If a drilling site is right next door to a pipeline, they chuck the gas in and take whatever cash the buyer on the other end is willing to pay that day. But if it’s 20 miles from a pipeline, drillers often burn it off, or flare it. That is why you will typically see flames rising from oil fields.', 'Beyond the environmental implications of flare gas, drillers are also, in effect, burning cash. To these two 23-year-old Aggie alums, it was a big problem with an obvious solution.', 'Giga places a shipping container full of thousands of bitcoin miners on an oil well, then diverts the natural gas into generators, which convert the gas into electricity that is then used to power the miners. The process reduces CO2-equivalent emissions by about 63% compared to continued flaring, according to research from Denver-based Crusoe Energy Systems.', '“Growing up, I always saw flares, just being in the oil and gas industry. I knew how wasteful it was,” Whitehead told CNBC on the sidelines of the North American Prospect Expo summit in Houston, a flagship event for the industry. “It’s a new way to not only lower emissions but to monetize gas.”', 'Whitehead tells CNBC they have signed deals with more than 20 oil and gas companies, four of which are publicly traded. Giga also says they’re also in talks with sovereign wealth funds, and they are expanding, fast. Giga’s 11-person team is adding another six employees this month.', 'Lohstroh and Whitehead are part of a growing movement of people placing big bets on the potential for bitcoin mining to transform the economics of the energy industry.', '“They are making their clients revenue through stranded energy bitcoin mining and solving the environmental challenge with flared gas at the same time,” said Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council.', 'The Giga executives are also big believers in the power of bitcoin to create a new kind of financial freedom.', '“No one controls it, and you don’t have to ask permission to use it,” said Lohstroh. “That’s really what drew me to bitcoin.”', 'It’s a similar sentiment for Whitehead, who tells CNBC that his views on self sovereignty, privacy, and individualism are part of what sent him down the proverbial bitcoin rabbit hole.', '“I wasn’t so much focused on the price, as I was the adoption. I thought this was something great for humanity,” said Whitehead.', 'You can think of bitcoin mining both as the security layer for the network and as the method by which new bitcoin are entered into circulation.', 'A bitcoin mining rig runs a program on a computer to try to solve a puzzle before anyone else does. Solving that puzzle is what completes a block, a process that both creates new bitcoin and updates the digital ledger keeping track of all bitcoin transactions. ', '“The cool thing about bitcoin that is under-appreciated by a lot of the naysayers is that it’s a portable market; you can bring it right to the source of energy,” said Steve Barbour, founder of Upstream Data, a Canadian company that manufactures and supplies portable mining solutions for oil and gas facilities.', 'Enter the oil and gas business, which often features sites in remote parts of Texas, far from major population centers.', 'More often than not, if a gas well isn’t already stationed near a pipeline, it won’t be big enough to warrant the time and expense of building an entirely new line. And if a driller can’t immediately find a way to sell the stash of natural gas, most dispose of it on site.', 'One method is to vent it, which releases methane directly into the air – a poor choice for the environment, as its greenhouse effects are shown to be much stronger than carbon dioxide. A more environmentally friendly option is to flare it, which means actually lighting the gas on fire. ', 'But flares are only 75 to 90% efficient, explained Adam Ortolf, who heads up business development in the U.S. for Upstream Data. “Even with a flare, some of the methane is being vented without being combusted,” he said.', 'This is when on-site bitcoin mining can prove to be especially impactful.', 'When the methane is run into an engine or generator, 100% of the methane is combusted and none of it leaks or vents into the air, according to Ortolf. ', '“But nobody will run it through a generator unless they can make money, because generators cost money to acquire and maintain,” he said. “So unless it’s economically sustainable, producers won’t internally combust the gas.”', 'Bitcoin makes it economically sustainable for oil and gas companies to combust their methane, rather than externally combust it with a flare, rendering stranded gas a thing of the past.', 'But Ortolf has taken years to convince people that parking a trailer full of ASICs on an oil and gas field is a smart and financially sound idea.', '“In 2018, I got laughed out of the room when I talked about mining bitcoin on flared gas,” said Ortolf. “The concept of bringing hydrocarbons to market without a counterparty was laughable.”', 'Fast forward four years, and business at Upstream is booming. It now works with 140 bitcoin mines across North America.', '“This is the best gift the oil and gas industry could’ve gotten,” said Ortolf. “They were leaving a lot of hydrocarbons on the table, but now, they’re no longer limited by geography to sell energy.” ', 'Meanwhile, bitcoin miners get what they want most: cheap electricity.', '“The thing about oil and gas is that it is a very distributed and reliable power source, and because of that, a distributed sales point and reliable power draw like a bitcoin mine is quite a good fit,” said Barbour. “It’s sort of a match made in heaven actually.”', 'The summer before his junior year in college, Whitehead was mowing his parents’ lawn in the southeast Texas town of Buna (population circa 2,000 people) when he got a text from Lohstroh, then a classmate and friend. In it, Lohstroh suggested they buy a mobile bitcoin mining container from Upstream Data and hitch it to a gas well themselves.', '“I just instantly stopped the lawn mower, walked straight to my dad, and I was like, ‘I gotta find flare gas right now,’” said Whitehead.', 'It was a natural reaction for Whitehead, who comes from a long line of “wildcats,” a term used to describe those who engage in high-risk exploratory drilling.', '“I call myself a digital wildcatter because now this is this next phase of wildcatting — bitcoin mining going to natural gas wells,” he said.', 'A week after Whitehead got the text, he and Lohstroh hopped on a plane up to Canada. Logistical acrobatics ensued, including having to drive a U-Haul truck three hours to Upstream’s facility in Calgary since neither was old enough to rent a car, but the pair wasn’t phased.', 'Upstream’s lead engineer and founder, Steve Barbour, tells CNBC he initially tried to warn Lohstroh not to make a purchase, since the container was still being field tested, but Lohstroh was committed to getting an order in.', '“True bitcoiners those two...they’re go-getters,” Barbour said of the Giga co-founders. “Both of them are what I, as a Canadian, think of Texans — entrepreneurial and wholesome. Just awesome dudes.”', 'Once the college classmates had the physical equipment they needed, they leveraged a connection who had some flare gas.', 'From there, they pounded the pavement looking to drum up business. At the 2020 NAPE summit, the Giga co-founders say they handed out about a thousand pamphlets trying to sell people on the idea of monetizing stranded gas.', '“A lot of people didn’t know about it. Most people laughed at us. Most people said, ‘It’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard,’” Whitehead said. Others said it was cool, but they didn’t think it would work, and then, there were a few who said we needed to talk to the company’s CEO.', 'Then came the pandemic.', '“Covid hit and shut down the world,” Whitehead told CNBC. Despite nationwide lockdowns, Giga continued to run 35 miners at its launch site, but business development virtually ground to a halt.', '“There was no traction in the space,” said Lohstroh. “Bitcoin was in a bear market. We were running around to meetings trying to draw up interest about bitcoin mining, and there was no interest at all.”', 'The team got creative by tracking down smaller customers in north and east Texas who were either “breaking the rules” or couldn’t get permits and were just wasting the gas. As Whitehead describes it, these smaller companies were often the ones that neglected regulatory compliance.', '“We were able to come in and say, ‘Hey, you’re flaring, and you shouldn’t be. You’re doing stuff that’s illegal, and you have opportunity here, because you have a shut-in well. We can take all this gas,’” recounted Whitehead.', 'But the real turning point for the company came in Dec. 2020, when the price of bitcoin broached the $20,000 threshold. That’s when some of the bigger players in the oil and gas industry started to take note, and leaders from publicly-traded companies began to approach them about getting into business.', 'Giga has also had companies fly in from abroad to shadow their operations and learn how the process works.', '“We’ve had people from companies in Saudi Arabia come to our sites in East Texas. And you know, they’ve probably never even seen a pine tree before, and we’re bringing them out for barbecue and showing them a bitcoin mine. They love it,” said Whitehead.', 'Giga tells CNBC that its revenue was more than $4 million in 2021, and it’s on track to earn more than $20 million by the end of 2022.', 'Whitehead says that some of their mining sites have helped to revitalize the local economy by creating jobs, such as field technicians and bitcoin pumpers, who go out to check the sites. In the small communities where they’ve set up a bitcoin mine, they are sometimes the largest source of revenue.', '“An area that was just a ghost town has now found ways to take their stranded energy that they were wasting and monetize it, and that’s what gets me excited, because like that’s what is helping the community overall,” said Whitehead.', 'Countless bitcoin miners now say that oil and gas is going to dominate the crypto mining industry in the coming decades, which bodes well for Giga’s business model.', '“It’s a frenzy out there,” said Barbour.', 'But Lohstroh tells CNBC the next stage is for the energy producers themselves to become the bitcoin miners.', '“I think that’s the next large transition, whether that’d be power producers, natural gas producers, upstream, midstream, downstream. I think at all sectors within the industry space, they’re going to be affected by bitcoin mining, because bitcoin mining is innately tied to power, and the point of energy is to create power. And so I think you’re gonna see a lot of semantics and how they’re interrelated,” he said.']"

', '\u200b\u200bFriendly reminder: Don’t be a hero and consider these predictions investment advice. They are not. They are meant for fun and to make you think. You can razz me about them if they are wrong at the end of the year.', '\u200bThat said, I basically went 5 for 5 on my predictions this year. One could dither over the “Roaring 20s” prediction, given omicron, but there’s no indication the economy is slowing down so I’ll take that as a win. As of this writing, the Invesco DB Commodity Index Tracking ETF and medical device company DexCom which I referenced in my predictions, are both up more than 40% year-to-date. That’s more than the Invesco QQQ ETF, which gained 28%, and the S&P 500, up 27% in 2021.', '\u200bNow, on to 2022 and the booms to come.\u200b', 'Prediction: CPI tops 4% on average all year', 'Inflation will get worse before it gets better. Wages are on the rise (that’s good!) but costs are likely to rise even more (that’s bad). Home prices and rents are still too darn high. Car prices remain in the stratosphere. Energy costs will rise this winter. Want to eat? Not only are food costs up — or packages getting smaller — but record fertilizer prices now could send food prices even higher next year. Also, no, the shipping and ports situation isn’t much better, despite what you may hear. Rather, the ships are just moving further offshore. And sorry Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell, unless you learn how to farm or unload containers, a few interest rate hikes won’t matter much in the near term. Assuming the government doesn’t change the inflation metrics on us (hey, it’s an election year after all), we should end 2022 with an annual consumer price index gain of more than 4%. \u200b', 'Prediction: Record births in the U.S.', 'I love this prediction. I so want it to be correct. The pandemic and lockdowns have taken a toll. On lives, families, and our collective psyches. But we’re coming out of it, because people are going to do what people do: move forward. No matter what happens with Covid. Singles are mingling. Travel is booming. Love is in the air. Even hip millennials are buying big homes in the sleepy suburbs. Homes with extra bedrooms. Wink, wink. The “kids” are all testing. Not for Covid, but for children. The pandemic has brought family back in focus. That’s a good thing. Birth rates in the U.S. have been declining forever. That should change next year. Is there a kid-centric ETF? There should be. Think about going long baby stuff and anything birth-related, like shares of already red-hot Progyny.', 'Prediction: Nikkei 225 tops the S&P 500', 'Japan is a country on the rise. Sound odd, right? Sure, Japan’s got a stagnant economy. Has for years. Numerous recessions in the past few decades. And hey, Japan needs a baby boom so bad that the government has come up with policies to incentivize family creation. But from a company perspective, Japan has got it going on. Valuations of Nikkei companies are well below that of the S&P 500, even as earnings are growing. Oh, and Japan’s fiscal policy is as easy as ours. The analysts at Jefferies see value in many Japanese companies like Sony, Toyota, Suzuki, Subaru, Denso and others. Bottom line: the iShares MSCI Japan ETF EWJ outperforms the S&P 500 in 2022.', 'Prediction: Electric vehicle sales top 10% of the car market', 'Hope finally meets hype. Electric vehicles (EVs) are still a tiny tot in the American car market. They account for about 4% of passenger car sales, according to BloombergNEF. They’re hampered by high prices and worries about battery life. That changes in 2022. The number of electric models available will double to about 20. It’s still just a fraction of the 300 or so total models available, but meaningful for two reasons. First, you no longer need to be a bitcoin billionaire to afford an EV. Next, we’re getting what Americans really want: trucks and SUVs. Between the Ford F-150 Lightning and the Rivian R1T (Motor Trend truck of the year for 2022), along with midsized so-called “cute utes” like the Volkswagen ID.4, there are the options American families want (especially if we get the aforementioned baby boom). Price points are also coming down.', 'Maybe the biggest hurdle to sales outside of the cost — the availability of charging stations — is also being solved nationally. As I found out on a 517-mile road trip in an all-electric Polestar in August, range anxiety is a real thing. But as more charging stations get built and drivers can see they won’t have to worry about where to charge when not home, it will be a positive upward cycle that sends sales higher.', '\u200bPrediction: Copper and palladium look like gold', 'Want to build an EV?

Later, it came out that Nike was too. And then we got a repeat of the same M&A fanfiction that’s been going on since before Peloton went public: What about Apple?', 'Some of the best Apple-watchers thought it was likely to be a serious discussion within Apple. Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush, wrote Sunday night Apple could buy Peloton as a defensive move against a Big Tech rival like Amazon grabbing it first. He called the potential acquisition a “strategic fit.”', 'Many others have thought the same for years now, and Apple is right back in the conversation now that we know a Peloton sale is more likely now than it has ever been.', 'But there are far more reasons Apple will decide to take a hard pass on Peloton, if its history has been any guide.', 'Apple rarely makes large acquisitions. Peloton’s market cap was a bit more than $12 billion by Tuesday afternoon. Apple has never even come close to buying a company that large. Its largest acquisition to date was Beats for $3 billion. ', 'Besides that, just about every other acquisition has been too small for Apple to meet the requirements to report them. We usually only find out about an Apple acquisition after someone in the press reports on it.', 'Apple tends to buy companies for their technology and staff. These are called “acquihires,” which is when a larger company buys a smaller one and integrates their employees and technology into new or existing products. For example, your iPhone’s weather app got a big update last year because Apple acquihired a company that made a weather app called Dark Sky.', 'Apple is obsessed with making its own hardware and software, and keeping high profit margins. Peloton makes giant Android tablets with clunky software, connected to exercise gear. Plus, Peloton continues to lose money and its margins would put a drag on Apple’s own margins if the two companies merged.', 'Pelton’s fourth-quarter earnings report from Tuesday morning paints a dismal picture for the company’s 2022. The company reported disappointing subscriber numbers, canceled plans to build a $400 million factory in Ohio and fired 2,800 employees. It’s hard to imagine what Apple would find appealing in that report.', 'Apple doesn’t need Peloton’s subscribers. Peloton has 6.6 million subscribers, a relatively tiny number compared to the 785 million paid subscribers Apple says it has through App Store apps. Plus, some of those Apple subscribers include Peloton customers who signed up through the App Store, meaning Apple already gets a cut of some of Peloton’s subscription revenue today.', 'But wait! Couldn’t Apple surprise us like it did when it bought Beats? Sure, if you want to compare stationary bikes to LeBron’s favorite headphones.', 'Apple bought Beats primarily for its streaming music service, which it transformed into Apple Music a year after the companies merged.

This could eventually lead to even tighter supplies of smaller-volume bottles down the line because the emphasis will likely go on the more popular sizes, the 750 milliliter and the 1.75 liter.', 'In the short term, some consumers may have to put in more effort to find their favorite booze.', '“From the consumer’s perspective, if there’s a special bottle that you want for the holiday season, you might have to go back to the store a few times before you find it,” Ozgo said. “But I will say this, there are over 16,000 spirits-based products marketed in any given year. So this might be the opportunity to try a new drink.”', 'Castle & Key distillery in Frankfort, Kentucky, is among the many distillers that have changed glass suppliers in the face of supply chain woes.', '“The factory that we were working with in the U.K. had a coronavirus outbreak and had to completely shut down, so that put our production way behind schedule by at least a few months,” said Jessica Peterson, the distillery’s director of operations.', 'Peterson said that when operations in the U.K. reopened, the distillery was forced to address supply chain issues and therefore had to transition to air freight temporarily due to delays facing sea cargo.', '“The preferred method typically would be sea freight,” Peterson said, adding that sea freight costs had tripled during the pandemic. Since then, the distillery has shifted to a supplier in Guadalajara, Mexico, that delivered orders via rail.', '“Since the transition, we’ve been able to have a steady supply of glass,” Peterson said.', '“I’ve heard from other folks that the demand for shipping containers has gotten so high that they’ve gone to paying close to $6,000, upwards of $20,000, for just the container.

However, with such a small portion of its glass imported, Waterloo has seen its orders double this year as supply chain issues have emerged and wineries and distilleries hunted for new suppliers.', 'Waterloo is also a stocking supplier rather than following the “just-in-time” model, so it always has extra inventory on hand.', '“We have actually shipped more bottles to the West Coast here from our business this year than we have in the last 20 years,” Lutz said.', 'Most of the glass bottles used in the U.S. come from outside the country. Years ago, glass manufacturers shifted production to countries where glass could be made more cheaply — mostly in Asia.', 'Mauricio Perez, North American regional director for Panamanian glass supplier BPS Glass, estimated that 60% to 70% of glass bottles used in the U.S. came from China, at least before the Trump administration’s trade war. Tariffs on glass imports from China convinced some manufacturers to import glass from factories in Europe or Latin America instead to meet demand.', 'Then the pandemic hit, with waves of new cases followed by more lockdowns, inciting supply chain problems worldwide.', 'For winemakers outside the U.S., the problem is more dire. Wine and spirits makers in Latin America are facing tougher shortages because of the shift by some companies during the trade war to use glass made in countries such as Chile rather than China, according to Perez.', 'It’s a situation that’s not easily solved. It can take a year or two to build glass furnaces or establish new production lines.', '“Glass supply can’t come back to the United States because there’s just not enough glass capacity at the manufacturers anymore,” Lutz said.']"

But given that Macy’s dotcom sales have been outpacing same-store revenues for years — and that the company operates 788 stores across its portfolio — begs another question: Is Macy’s current management team, led by the “quintessential department store executive,” as one retail investor recently characterized Macy’s CEO Jeff Gennette, the best choice for leading the nation’s largest legacy department store into the new era of retail that is increasingly sophisticated, digital and dominated by digitally-native competitors like Amazon?', 'Both questions have dogged Macy’s since October, when activist investor Jana Partners implied in a presentation to investors that Macy’s could boost its valuation by spinning off its e-commerce business. Jana, with its history of pushing large retailers to shake up operations, took a stake in Macy’s and soon after that presentation urged the company’s board in a letter to spin off the digital arm, speculating that Macy’s online arm could be worth about $14 billion, roughly twice what Macy’s is valued at today.', 'Macy’s declined to comment ahead of earnings.', 'Jana Partners won’t comment on its stake in Macy’s, but a person familiar with the situation said that Macy’s is being urged to evaluate pursuing the same strategy followed by Saks Fifth Avenue of bringing in an investor to its dot-com business to accelerate its growth, highlight its value and better position it to attract top technology talent. This last point was underscored twice recently at Saks, first when a former Amazon exec joined the board of the new Saks.com — which is reportedly readying its initial public offering — and then over the summer, when another former Amazon executive took the COO role at the new standalone Saks Off 5th e-commerce company.', '“Companies are going to be learning from people who aren’t necessarily in their own swim lanes,” said Bernadette Nixon, CEO of Algolia, a technology firm that helps retailers optimize their e-commerce.

Gennette has been with Macy’s almost exclusively since 1983, when as an undergraduate at Stanford University he was hired into its executive trainee program. According to the Wall Street Journal, he rose through Macy’s ranks with both merchandising and store operations experience, and made capturing millennial shoppers and bringing entertainment into Macy’s stores two big goals when he became CEO.', 'Three decades spent at the same legacy department store likely helps to explain why he sees the retail landscape of future as more than just digital.', '“To me, it’s clear that a comprehensive retail ecosystem with physical stores in the best malls and the most productive off-mall locations integrated with the best-in-class e-commerce offering is a powerful combination and is moving us forward as a strong, digitally-led omnichannel business,” Gennette said on Macy’s second quarter earnings conference call on August 19.', 'Macy’s stock price is up about 34% since Jana Partners first suggested a spinoff, but historically, love from Wall Street, which views Gennette as a solid brick-and-mortar guy, has been rare.', '“Macy’s online business doesn’t get the respect it deserves,” says David Swartz, an equity analyst at Morningstar Research. “It’s one of the largest online retailers in the country and its valuation has not always reflected that.”', 'Swartz says that Macy’s online enhancements are working, even if it’s not solving the problem of fewer people overall shopping at Macy’s physical locations.

In an effort to capitalize on its most valuable customers — those who shop at Macy’s both in-person and online tend to spend three times more than those who only shop at one or the other — Macy’s has invested in data analytics so it can follow when and what they shop, then tailor incentive programs and product messaging to them.', 'Macy’s is also using social media and digital messaging to try and drive people to their stores, although analysts say there are still too many locations.', '“The retail landscape has been changing at a slow rate and the pandemic sped it up — there were way too many stores in the U.S.,” says Jessica Ramirez, a retail research analyst with Jane Hali and Associates. “With Macy’s, its square footage was ridiculous. However, there is still excitement within apparel to visit a store; you just need something to lure customers in.”', 'The place for brick-and-mortar stores in the future of retail will be as channels for branding, say analysts. “You still have people who grew up in the late 1980s and 1990s running large companies with physical assets stuck on this idea of a physical store being a profit center, and that’s no longer going to be true,” says Lee Peterson, executive vice president at WD Partners, a retail consultancy. “The mentality needs to change to, physical is all about brand and online is about buy. What’s going to make me really want to go to a department store?”', 'Making Macy’s stores a destination will require innovation. Unlike higher-end competitor Nordstrom, Macy’s isn’t known for its cutting edge fashion brands, notes Ramirez. The company is trying to improve its trendiness, building out private label brands across all its segments. It’s currently in the process of debuting Oak, a line of eco-conscious textiles and home goods. Macy’s has also partnered with Toys R Us to exploit toy sales, a sector that bloomed during the pandemic and brought in new customers — millennial parents — many who came for toys then who went on to buy higher-margin goods, Gennette said on the call.', 'While analysts aren’t so sure about the long-term growth potential of building out mini toy shops inside Macy’s stores, they see lots of upside in Macy’s using its stores to provide customers with additional places to pick up or return things they ordered online. Perfected by Target and Walmart during the pandemic, the idea of using physical stores for curbside pickup and other distribution efforts has been so effective that even Amazon wants in; it’s likely part of the reason why it’s planning on opening its own brick-and-mortar department stores. “It makes sense why Amazon wants to open stores—they’re getting inventory closer to their customers,” says Ramirez. “It’s that last mile that everyone is fighting for.”', 'Pent-up customer demand to return to stores in person post-pandemic was a big factor in Macy’s stellar second quarter results — net sales rose 58.7% year over year to $5.6 billion and comparable sales were up 61.2%. Morningstar forecasts an operating margin of 7% on 36% sales growth for 2021, which would be Macy’s highest since 2015. While Swartz says those margins might not be sustainable for the long term, he doesn’t think spinning off Macys.com is the answer.', '“This idea of splitting these businesses up goes contrary to integrating the physical stores with the dot com stores — the industry is changing in a way that there’s almost no line between those two businesses anymore,” he says. “Macy’s whole strategy has been to try and bolster both by using them together to increase sales and reduce costs on shipping, fulfillment and distribution.”', 'Other skeptics are questioning the long-term viability of separating Macy’s two business streams, especially in a bubbly environment where some digital firms may be overvalued. “Activist investors can often be engaged in simple financial engineering and aren’t thinking about shareholders but making a quick buck,” says James Hoopes, Murata Professor of Ethics in Business at Babson College. “Activist investors sometimes unlock wealth and sometimes they destroy wealth.”', 'Against the backdrop of extravagant valuations for digital businesses — only a few months after being separated financially from Saks, Saks.com is supposedly preparing for its IPO with media reports of a potential $6 billion valuation — Macy’s rapidly-growing e-commerce segment is undoubtedly attractive for impatient investors. Under Gennette’s watch, digital sales for Macy’s grew 7.7% in 2019 and 23.7% in 2020, although investors are wary that could be cannibalizing physical store sales.', 'It’s Macy’s giant department store footprint that has investors wondering if its executive team needs a little help pivoting to a business model where its brick-and-mortar entities better serve the needs of its dot-com. But as one retail investor put it, when it comes to Gennette, “Who better to succeed in making this pivot than a person who’s a dyed-in-the-wool brick-and-mortar guy? That would be one powerful message.”']"

Representatives for Facebook and Patagonia didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.', 'According to Polly Wong, president of the full-service marketing strategy firm Belardi Wong, the troubles at Facebook became an even bigger headache for direct-to-consumer brands compared with traditional retailers. That’s because many of them got their start thanks to creative Facebook ads that directed customers to their websites, rather than relying on swaths of stores.', '“There’s no question that the vast majority of DTC [direct-to-consumer] brands build their business on Facebook, with Google being second,” Wong said. “But right now, more than half of our clients are seeing Facebook underperform.”', 'Belardi Wong’s clients include eco-friendly shoe brand Allbirds, the bedding maker Parachute, men’s clothing company Buck Mason and dozens of other direct-to-consumer businesses, according to its website.', 'An analysis by the market research company eMarketer found that users in the U.S. are expected to spend less time scrolling through Facebook this year and in the coming years.

It forecasts it will drop another 1.8% from 2021 to 2022, and fall another 0.7% in 2023.', '“As people have returned to their normal lives ... going to restaurants and gyms and traveling out and about, there’s less screen time. And less screen time, as a fact, means less impressions,” Wong said. “And when there are less impressions, but there’s still huge marketing demand, it drives the price of those impressions up. There’s more competition from advertisers for the same impressions.”', 'CPMs, a marketing term used to denote the price of 1,000 advertisement impressions, are skyrocketing, Wong said. Over the summer months, Belardi Wong was tracking 50% increases to CPMs on Facebook, she said. And the company is projecting CPMs could go up another 50% on top of that this holiday season.', 'More retail brands are testing out direct mail catalogs, podcasts and large-scale television campaigns to diversify their marketing mix, Wong said.

But we anticipated a lot of it and have been able to implement fallback plans for various types of marketing campaigns, based on delays.”', 'According to Wong, many companies fall in one of two camps. Either the retailer has enough products to sell, but might sell out before Black Friday, so it is encouraging shoppers to buy early. Or, the retailer is waiting on goods to arrive, so the business is holding off on marketing blitzes until then.', '“We actually have a few clients, unfortunately, where we couldn’t pull the trigger soon enough,” Wong said. “There are actually catalogs going home for some of our clients where half the products are not even available within the catalog.”', 'Correction: Poshmark’s shares closed down nearly 29% on Wednesday.

', 'Ben has spread his mining equipment across multiple sites so that no one operation stands out on the country’s electrical grid. He has also gone “behind the meter,” drawing electricity directly from small, local power sources that are not connected to the larger grid, such as dams. He’s taken steps to conceal his geographic digital footprint, as well.', 'Ben tells CNBC that he is used to “getting around things” when it comes to running a business in China, but the last six months have really raised the stakes. ', '“We never know to what extent our government will try to crack down…to wipe us out,” Ben said.', 'Ben is not alone. ', 'Although Beijing exiled its crypto miners in May and then doubled down on its mining ban in September and again in November, multiple sources tell CNBC that as much as 20% of all the world’s bitcoin miners remain in China. This is well off its peak of around 65% to 75% of the global market, but it is substantially more than an official estimate from Cambridge University that puts China’s current share at 0%. ', 'Data from Chinese cybersecurity company Qihoo 360 shows that underground crypto mining appears to be alive and well in China. In a November report, the research group estimated that there are an average of 109,000 active crypto mining IP addresses in China on a daily basis. Most of those addresses, according to the report, are in the provinces of Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shandong.', 'Crypto mining has survived in China, in part, because lot of miners weren’t sure whether Beijing was actually serious about the ban. ', 'China has repeatedly lashed out against digital currencies, but each time, the sting wore off, and the rules eventually softened. The country’s announcement this spring that it would be cracking down on crypto mining dovetailed with the centennial of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, a time when there was pressure on lawmakers to show strength. Some miners – especially smaller-scale operators who didn’t have the resources or the connections to migrate abroad – figured a lot of the crypto talk by the government was bravado, so they powered down, laid low for a few weeks, and then came back online, taking a few extra precautions when they did. ', 'But this crypto crackdown appears to be different for a few big reasons.', 'For one, China is short on power, a resource vital to the process of bitcoin mining. The country has been dealing with its worst energy shortage in a decade, resulting in power cuts.', 'Beijing has also made it clear that crypto mining stands in the way of its aggressive climate targets, as it pushes to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. In November, government spokesperson Meng Wei slammed bitcoin mining, calling it an “extremely harmful” practice and vowing stricter enforcement measures.', 'There’s looming competition from the digital yuan, as well. The country is testing its own central bank digital currency, which could grant the government greater power to track spending in real-time. Making it harder to transact in rival cryptocurrencies could be part of a larger plan to ensure adoption of this new central bank digital currency, according to Fred Thiel, CEO of Marathon Digital Holdings and a member of the Bitcoin Mining Council.', '“China’s government is doing everything they can to ensure that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies disappear from the Chinese financial systems and economy,” speculated Thiel. “Part of this is to ensure the adoption of China’s central bank digital currency, and part of this is most probably to ensure financial surveillance activities are able to see all economic activity.”', 'Whatever the impetus, the government’s growing hostility toward crypto-related endeavors is apparent.', 'In the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hebei, and Inner Mongolia, for example, the government has taken varying degrees of action, such as asking local officials to run their own self-compliance checks, screening IP addresses for illicit mining activity, raiding illegal underground crypto mines, and arresting and expelling party members suspected of participating in crypto mining schemes.', 'Authorities appear to be paying special attention to mining happening at research institutions, community centers, and schools, where electricity prices sometimes cost less than the going rate. In November, the government vowed to hike energy prices for institutions that use subsidized power to mine.', 'Authorities are also zeroing in on state-owned businesses taking part in the trade.', 'This week, China’s Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the country’s anti-corruption watchdog, said it had identified dozens of state-owned entities in the eastern province of Zhejiang that were using public resources to mine for twelve cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, ether, litecoin, and monero. Of the nearly 50 people who were penalized, 21 worked at state-owned enterprises or Communist Party agencies.', 'State-owned entities have been tied up in crypto mining schemes elsewhere, too.', 'In the coastal region of Jiangsu, the communication watchdog for the province found that 21% of the IP addresses participating in crypto mining were from state-owned institutions.', 'Despite the government’s significant and growing efforts to weed out all crypto miners, many, like Ben, have found ways to survive undetected.', 'When China began its crypto mining takedown in May, most of the industry went dark virtually overnight, as miners waited for the dust to settle.', 'CNBC spoke to multiple participants in China’s illicit crypto mining market, some of whom have spent time on the ground in China and others who have direct knowledge of how these operations continue to exist under the ever-increasing scrutiny of regulators.', 'The biggest players in the business, who already had connections overseas and cash to spare, got out fast. Many shipped their gear and moved their teams to Kazakhstan, the U.S., and other international destinations with low-cost power and available hosting capacity.  ', 'Some heavy hitters left their gear sitting in warehouses in Asia and headed to greener pastures empty-handed, instead placing orders for the latest-generation machines to be delivered to their new homes abroad.', 'But smaller miners with limited disposable income and fewer international connections found it hard to relocate thanks to pandemic-related travel restrictions, supply chain and shipping bottlenecks, and trade war headwinds between China and the U.S.', 'Selling gear wasn’t all that effective as an off-ramp either, as the flood of inventory into the resale market tanked the going rate for mining rigs.', 'Medium-sized miners were “100% screwed” in this year’s crackdown, according to one expert speaking to CNBC. They couldn’t offload their equipment to recoup their losses, nor could they mine at full capacity again, because their electrical footprint is easy to pick out.', 'But for the smaller mines, like the ones Ben runs, it’s been easier to fly under the radar. Some divided their mining operations into multiple farms across the country that the authorities were less likely to notice. Others piggybacked off small, local power sources, like tiny dams in rural areas that are not connected to the main electric grid.', '“Mining is no longer a big business,” said one bitcoin miner who has spent years minting crypto all over the world, including in China, and asked to remain anonymous for fear of the authorities. Instead, the industry has turned into more of a piecemeal operation, with “a couple thousand miners here, a couple thousand miners there.”', '“It’s more like a sort of band-aid to make money to help move the miners out of the country.”', 'Ben – who has been mining cryptocurrencies since 2015 – has one thousand mining rigs that are powered by grid electricity and another five thousand units tethered to hydropower, direct from the source in the southern province of Sichuan.', 'For the hundreds of miners running on grid power, Ben told CNBC that he has spread them out across the country, in order to evade detection by authorities.', '“They’re everywhere. You won’t find a pattern,” Ben said of the mining gear that he has plugged into industrial power lines wherever his friends will let him grab a bit of extra power.', 'This is now common practice for many miners, according to Marshall Long, who has been mining for cryptocurrencies for over a decade in places like Sweden, Iceland, and China.', '“They are drawing from the grid, and they are smaller scale now, so they are fragmented,” Long said, referring to his many friends who are mining in China under the radar. “They’re usually doing it in chunks of 20 megawatts or smaller, so they’re kind of like home-buying their way to allow them to small-scale mine.”', 'To put that into context, downtown Dallas uses 200 megawatts, and once the build-out is complete, America’s largest mine will have a total power capacity of 750 megawatts.', 'But Ben said the problem with this technique is that grid pricing is “really expensive.” Using off-grid power allows for much better profit margins, and it is easier to operate on the sly.', 'The wet season in China runs from May into the late fall, and monsoon-level rainfall translates to an abundance of hydropower, which is more easily captured from behind the meter.', 'Beijing’s crypto bans came as miners were already heading to Sichuan and Yunnan, two of the main provinces for crypto mining, thanks to their decentralized constellation of thousands of dams. Compared to the coal plants in the northern provinces of Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia, which were once bastions of the crypto mining network, these dams are less trackable and harder to identify – and therefore less accountable to government regulation.', '“There is definitely a lot of miners attached to hundreds upon thousands of hydro dams within Sichuan,” said Kevin Zhang of digital currency company Foundry, which helped bring over $400 million of mining equipment from China into North America.', 'In Ben’s case, most of his rigs run on hydropower. He has two sites in Sichuan. One is 12 megawatts and the second is eight megawatts. Ben told CNBC that in China, a mine that is above one megawatt at a single location is now considered sizable.', 'Even before the ban, it was increasingly standard practice for miners of means to rent (or build) their own transformers and substations, in order to provide power to mining sites directly from power plants. Transformers take the power from a substation and convert it to a lower voltage that can then be used to power bitcoin miners. ', 'At one of his locations in Sichuan, Ben paid a one-time fee to lease an entire power plant that operates off the grid, which is one way he lowers his chance of being found out.', 'While Ben has taken steps to hide his activity, he’s not totally immune to detection. He says that China Telecom, one of the country’s biggest telecommunications companies, doubles as the mining police in China by looking out for suspicious electricity usage.', 'Once identified, the chain of command becomes a game of telephone — China Telecom refers the activity to the central government, who then relays this information to the specific province or town where the alleged mining is happening. From there, according to Ben, the local government calls the power plant directly to investigate the allegation.', 'This recently happened to Ben, but he says he was lucky because the power plant owner likes him. When the government contacted the power plant about suspicious activity, the owner covered for Ben. After the call, Ben shut off the mine for a few days, took some extra steps to mask his network traffic, then powered back on.', 'This kind of IT hygiene is critical to keeping miners off the radar.', 'Miners conceal their IP address by using a virtual private network, or VPN, to mask their geographic digital footprint. But Beijing is wise to the use of VPNs as a tool to evade government censorship and has cracked down on their use.', 'Most underground miners are now turning to mining pools as another way to hide their tracks, joining cryptocurrency miners from around the planet to combine their computing power. Even though many mining pools have announced a suspension of services inside China, multiple sources tell CNBC that some foreign pools are still signing up Chinese miners.', '“They hide their hashrate,” explained Ben. Hashrate is an industry term used to describe the collective computing power of all miners in the bitcoin network.', 'Typically, when a block of transactions is “mined” and added to the digital ledger of transactions known as the blockchain, the pool that won it signs its name to the block. Multiple sources tell CNBC that now, when Chinese miners contribute their computing power to solving a block, pools opt to not sign their name, which is a departure from past protocol.', '“A pool doesn’t have to reveal any data,” continued Ben. “You’re basically telling the world that my revenue is only half of what I actually have. You don’t brag about it.”', 'This could help to explain why China’s share of the global bitcoin market went to zero practically overnight, since the bitcoin mining index is based upon data voluntarily shared by mining pools.', 'Though pools are quiet about working with Chinese miners, they have been very helpful to many of these underground operations behind the scenes, according to multiple sources.', '“There are some larger pools who still care. They actually provide a lot of technical support to help you, in case your own people don’t have the technical ability to set it up,” Ben said.', 'Long tells CNBC that many of these foreign pools provide them with technology that disguises what they’re doing.', '“They are encrypting their packets as it leaves the data center, so it just looks like ordinary web traffic,” Long said.', 'As Ben described it, one pool that he works with helped him to set up a server that made his mine look as though it had fewer “connection points.” When one IP address has thousands of connection points, each of which is submitting massive amounts of data, that looks suspicious to authorities, especially in a rural area like Sichuan. But Ben says that pools help miners get around that.', '“After they do their magic, you’re only going to see five machines, which then does not look suspicious, because any household can have that,” Ben said.', 'But China’s underground miners have a new and very big problem: The wet season is over.', 'In years past, miners would pack up their gear and truck it to either Xinjiang or Inner Mongolia to tap into the electricity generated by coal-powered plants. Both those regions are now closed off to miners.', '“It’s going to get really interesting,” said Zhang, who estimates that China’s share of the global bitcoin market will plummet to 5% as hydro dams dry up. “A lot of miners will have to capitulate and send gear abroad.”', 'Zhang told CNBC that it’s “very painful” when you have to unplug and re-route your miners over and over again, so he suspects that many will look to North America, where they can sign longer-term agreements. “It’s a more stable framework, and it’s not going to change on you overnight,” he said.', 'Ben is weighing that option right now.', 'But until he strikes a deal with an American host, Ben is in a bit of a holding pattern. Although he says he is selling some of his S19 series Antminer ASICs, for the most part, he’s hanging on to a lot of his machines until he figures out next steps.', '“These are essentially money printers,” explained Zhang, who made the point that these machines grant virtually instant access to bitcoin, or U.S. dollars if you liquidate your crypto stake. In a country with very tight capital controls, that kind of insurance policy is pretty valuable.', '“It’s a big reason why a lot of miners haven’t capitulated and sold their equipment, because for them, it’s access to capital overseas…once they get it plugged in,” said Zhang.', 'CLARIFICATION: CNBC has changed Ben’s name to further protect the person’s identity.']"

Spire’s satellites help forecast weather, track ships at sea and airplanes in flight. ', 'Spire has about $265 million in cash on its books after the close of the deal, down from the $408 million the company expected to receive when it announced the merger in March. A Spire spokesperson noted that public stockholders filed to redeem about 90% of the firm’s outstanding shares — a high amount for a company that is going public.', 'But Platzer isn’t fazed by the redemptions, noting that the cash the company is receiving is “more money than Spire has ever had before and that Spire has spent and used in its nine-year history getting to this point.”', '“It’s a very unusual position for us to feel so exceptionally well-capitalized,” Platzer said.', 'Spire notably booked $36 million in revenue last year, and expects to nearly double that to $70 million in 2021. But the company needs to expand its customer base much further to reach $1.2 billion in revenue by 2025, which it forecast in its investor presentation.', 'The company has more than 110 satellites currently in orbit, in what Platzer describes as “the world’s largest multipurpose constellation.” Spire also has ground stations in 16 countries, with more than 70 antennas to quickly receive the satellite data and enter into its analytics platforms.', '“The starting point for us is a fully deployed global infrastructure,” Platzer said. “Everything is deployed, everything is operational at very high scale — processing terabytes of data, shipping to hundreds of customers.”', 'Now Spire is focused on “the monetization of that data,” he said, which it sells as an annual subscription service to customers. Platzer said Spire’s annual subscriptions are priced anywhere between tens of thousands of dollars to the “very high” millions.', 'Platzer gave the example of a Wall Street commodities trader focused on oil, who would want to know not just “where the ships are but where they will be” on the supply side but then use Spire’s analytics platform to look at the demand side, “which is driven by weather.”', 'Spire does not expect to grow its constellation of Lemur satellites, as they are refreshed on a three-year hardware replacement cycle. The company has done “tens of thousands of software upgrades over the last few years to make assets on orbit produce two to three times as much data,” Platzer said, and the company doesn’t see “any customer demand” that requires a larger constellation of satellites.', 'Spire’s growth strategy “is land and expand,” Platzer said.', '“You go into a particular use case, you land some customers, you grow those customers, and then you build around more customers,” Platzer added.', 'The company has offices in four countries so far — the U.S., the U.K., Luxembourg and Singapore — and customers in nearly 30 countries.', 'Platzer laid out a four-pronged growth strategy for Spire’s future: Hiring, geographic expansion, new data streams, and inorganic opportunities. Spire will focus on adding to its sales, marketing, and product teams in the near future. On the international side, Spire is looking to add customers in the Middle East and Asia, Platzer said, and being “a NYSE-listed company carries a lot of weight in opening doors.”', 'Finally, inorganic growth opportunities would include adding new technologies or new capabilities to Spire’s platform. One such capability Spire hopes to add is optical inter-satellite links, which would “drop the latency of the data dramatically,” Platzer said. Spire has tested radio frequency links with success in orbit, but optical inter-satellite links would take its capabilities a step further.']"

31,Ocado unveils lighter robots to help grocery giants like Kroger take on Amazon,2022-01-26T18:03:05+0000,"['LONDON — U.K. retail tech company Ocado on Wednesday unveiled a suite of new products aimed at helping large grocery chains take on Amazon and a wave of new rapid grocery delivery start-ups.', 'While Ocado is most well known for its online supermarket, a top focus for the company is robotics and automation tools that it deploys in warehouses to pick and pack items and prepare them for delivery.', 'Ocado sells its technology to top retailers including Kroger, Britain’s Morrisons and France’s Casino.', 'The company announced two new robots as part of its tech showcase Wednesday. The first is its 600 Series bot, which Ocado said is lighter and more energy-efficient than its predecessor, with over half of its parts 3D printed.', 'The second is a set of advanced robotic arms that pick items directly off the grid in the company’s warehouses. Ocado says it’s developed artificial intelligence technology to enhance the precision of the arms to something closer to that of human pickers.', 'Meanwhile, Ocado also touted what it calls a “virtual distribution center” — essentially a combination of software smarts and small micro-fulfillment centers connected through one system. Ocado said the offering would maximize capacity of items in each warehouse while also slashing delivery times.', 'Shares of Ocado rose more than 5% on Wednesday. The stock has declined sharply in the past year, slumping 46%, with investors fretting over high-growth stocks as economies emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic and central banks begin to talk of tightening monetary policy.', 'The news comes as retailers face competition not only from Amazon, but a slew of upstarts offering grocery delivery in a matter of minutes. Firms such as Getir and Gorillas have emerged across Europe and parts of the U.S. recently, backed by a flood of cash from venture capitalists.', 'Such companies rely on so-called dark stores, tiny warehouses that are designed to ship online orders rather than serve customers in-store.', 'Tim Steiner, Ocado’s CEO, said he doesn’t think these rapid grocery players pose a meaningful threat to big retailers.', '“There’s very little differentiation between all the players out there,” Steiner said on a call with reporters Wednesday. “They’re all remarkably similar.”', 'Some start-ups have been acquired by larger players of late, with Getir buying U.K. rival Weezy and Gorillas snapping up French firm Frichti. Ocado’s chief said he’s “not surprised” to see consolidation in the sector given how crowded it’s become.', 'As for how the company plans to fund building all its new technology products, Steiner said cost shouldn’t be an issue since the new robots will be more capital-efficient than its current models. But he added the firm has enough cash on its balance sheet — as well as access to bank financing — to eventually deploy them at scale.', 'Ocado plans to roll out the products to its retail partners by the end of 2023. The initiatives are unlikely to have a material impact on Ocado’s full-year 2022 results, the company said.']"

The U.S. has put thousands of troops on heightened alert, meaning they are ready to deploy to the region should the crisis escalate.', 'The U.S., the U.K. and the EU have already said that Russia will be subjected to new sanctions on key individuals and sectors of its economy if it does invade Ukraine. Russia has already seen sectors like energy, finance and defense targeted by previous rounds of sanctions for its 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.', 'But the U.S. gave its clearest signal yet on Tuesday that it will look to cripple Russia’s economy — which would likely lead to immense pressure on Putin, both from the Russian people and the country’s business leaders — if Moscow invades its neighbor again.', 'Biden said Tuesday that he would feel obliged to beef up NATO defenses in Poland and Romania, in Eastern Europe, and when asked whether he could see himself imposing sanctions on the Russian president personally, he replied, “Yes, I would see that.”', 'The U.K. has signaled it could do the same with the country’s foreign secretary, Liz Truss, saying, “we are not ruling out anything” when asked if Putin could be sanctioned, Reuters reported Wednesday.', 'Threats of personal sanctions against Putin would be a big step up from previous measures against the Russian state and could see the West target Putin’s wealth and inhibit his travel, although no further details have been revealed.', 'The Kremlin responded to those comments on Wednesday, saying any personal sanctions on Putin would be politically destructive, but not painful, according to Reuters.', 'Senior White House officials told reporters Tuesday on a call regarding economic deterrence measures being considered against Russia that “we are prepared to implement sanctions with massive consequences that were not considered in 2014” when Russia annexed Crimea.', 'The measures they’re considering range from more financial sanctions to the use of “novel export controls” that could greatly impede Russia’s access to U.S.-made technology components, similar to those used against Chinese technology giant Huawei.', '“The gradualism of the past is out, and this time we’ll start at the top of the escalation ladder and stay there. We’ve made efforts to signal this intention very clearly,” one senior White House official said on the call.', 'Officials said the U.S. was also prepared to impose export controls — which would essentially block Russia from obtaining U.S.-originated software and technology in an effort to harm key economic sectors in Russia. These could hurt “Putin’s strategic ambitions to industrialize his economy quite hard,” they said. ', 'Such controls, they noted, “would impair areas that are of importance to him, whether it’s in artificial intelligence or quantum computing, or defense, or aerospace, or other key sectors.”', 'That’s not an exhaustive list with “all options” very much on the table, the official added, saying “we’re united with Allies and partners to decisively impose severe consequences on Russia if it further invades Ukraine.”', 'When asked if export controls could impact global supply chains, one official said there would be a minimal impact “because we’re talking about denying to Russia downstream products that are critical to its own ambitions to develop high-tech capabilities in aerospace and defense, lasers and sensors, maritime, AI, robotics, quantum, et cetera.”', '“And in each of these supply chains, we and/or our allies and partners design and produce the technology. And the export control would deny to Russia a sophisticated input that it can’t replace through domestic production or alternate supplies.”', 'Such sectors, the official noted, were deliberately earmarked as ones that “Putin himself has championed as the way forward for Russia to diversify its economy beyond oil and gas” — another sector that the U.S. could seek to undermine if Russia weaponizes energy supplies.', 'Europe’s energy sphere has become something of a battleground for Russia and the U.S. in recent years and the issue has come to the fore as tensions have grown over Ukraine.', 'Russia supplies the European Union with around 40% of its natural gas supplies, and has built a massive gas pipeline, Nord Stream 2, so it can send gas supplies directly to Germany, bypassing Ukraine. The U.S., which would like to increase its own liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, has condemned the project as damaging Europe’s energy security.', 'Indeed, the Biden administration has been looking at ways to secure energy for European allies in case Moscow decides to cut its energy supplies to the region in a bid to extract concessions over Ukraine.', 'One senior administration official, who declined to be named in order to share details of ongoing plans, told CNBC on Tuesday that the administration was coordinating with major buyers and suppliers of LNG to ensure a diversion of supplies to Europe if necessary.', 'Some analysts have pointed out that the latest signals coming from the U.S. on potential sanctions on Russia are the strongest they’ve seen.', '“I have been monitoring U.S. sanctions language on Russia since 2014 and what we are seeing below is a huge step up,” Timothy Ash, a senior emerging markets sovereign strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, said Tuesday night in a research note.', '“The U.S. officials are saying to Putin ‘bring it on, you go into Ukraine we are going to sanction you to hell, and try retaliation via cutting energy supplies to Europe. We are planning for that — we will get Europe thru the winter and you will end up as the loser.’ The U.S. is trying to help Europe break its energy dependence on Russia,” he noted.', 'Close followers of Russian politics believe that the current surge in tensions over Ukraine reflects Moscow’s (and more specifically, Putin’s) bid to reverse the expansion of Western influence in Russia’s backyard, and former territories, since the end of the Cold War and fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.', 'Sanctions remain one of the few options open to the West as there is little appetite to engage in a military conflict with Russia. Ukraine is not a member of NATO and, as such, the military alliance is not obliged to defend it.', 'But Western allies want to stop Russia from controlling and coercing (and invading) its neighbors. Russia, meanwhile, wants legal assurances that Ukraine will never be able to join NATO and for a rollback of the alliance’s deployments in Eastern Europe. The U.S. and NATO have refused those demands.', '“The Western allies have limited room for concessions” when it comes to Russia, according to Andrius Tursa, Central and Eastern Europe advisor at Teneo Intelligence.', '“They would risk undermining the credibility of the U.S. and NATO security guarantees, which form the backbone of the post-Cold War security architecture in Europe. After all, the demise of the post-Cold War security order seems to be one of the Kremlin’s key objectives,” he said in a note Tuesday.', '“Even if the current crisis is resolved through diplomacy, relations between Russia and the West appear to have approached a more hostile and unpredictable phase. The Kremlin’s perception of the US – and by extension NATO – as its main geopolitical rival is unlikely to dissipate until there are any meaningful changes in Russia’s political leadership.”', 'Markets have been on edge this week as Ukraine concerns have dominated global headlines, and there is little certainty over what Putin will do next.', 'On Tuesday, Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, said in note that “the heightened risk that he may invade Ukraine has started to affect markets ... this is not our base case. Still, it is among the tail risks that we need to ponder. Like other observers, we do not know what Putin is up to and what may happen next.”', 'Schmieding said Putin had already gained some victories at home from the crisis over Ukraine, with higher oil and gas prices a boon to energy exporter Russia.', '“Facing mounting concerns about falling living standards at home, Putin is currently reaping windfall gains from the surge in oil and natural gas prices,” Schmieding noted, adding that “with his sabre rattling, he has already achieved something. The world is talking about him. The U.S. and Russia are discussing the fate of Europe, occasionally even without Europe itself present at the table.”', '“Putin can present this to his domestic audience as a return to the times of the Cold War when the U.S. and the Soviet Union were the two global players that mattered most.”']"

The buying and selling action in EV stocks lately has been intense, from all the fuss over Elon Musk’s selling of Tesla shares to former Tesla executive Peter Rawlinson’s Lucid Group, which went public earlier this year and is now at a valuation over $80 billion, just about as big as the Detroit stalwarts.', 'As the stock market faces a new test after President Joe Biden reappointed Jerome Powell to lead the Federal Reserve, leading to market calls that investors are about to cycle back into value stocks and away from the hottest growth names ahead of interest rate hike pressures, Tesla’s competitors have been giving back some gains. Are EV stocks in a bubble?', 'CNBC recently spoke with Nick Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research and a former Wall Street auto industry analyst, about what’s going on in the EV space.', 'Rivian’s valuation is extremely high, according to Colas. “There is no getting around that. Any time you are talking about a company that hasn’t sold any product yet and has a $100 billion valuation it is a huge valuation, but it is not necessarily a bubble,” he said.', 'Tesla itself did not have an $80 billion-plus market cap until early 2020, Colas noted in a recent research note, and by then, it was producing 100,000 vehicles a quarter. Rivian is just starting to ship its first customer vehicles now.', 'The recent investor interest in EV stocks and their valuation gains reflects one element of what makes a bubble: an imbalance between the supply of a particular investment desire and demand. Market bubbles can form when too much money is put to work in a particular area that is short on supply. Overall, Colas isn’t worried about the stock market being in a bubble that pops any time soon because the liquidity in the market remains high, as do household savings which will continue to pursue market gains. But within the longer-term EV story, there is the fact that investors are chasing the few names available to them.', '“Investors are looking for any possible play in autonomous vehicles and EVs and there is a real shortage of opportunities, and that’s why a Tesla or Rivian is so highly valued. Because there aren’t enough EV stocks out there,” Colas said. “You do have to provide the market with what it wants, or it creates bubbles to some degree.”', 'Colas, though, isn’t ready to call a bubble in EVs. He says the whole ecosystem of EVs is exactly the way the auto industry was a century ago, which started out very fragmented and then took 80 years to come down to the Big Three. “In EVs, it could be eight years,” he said.', 'And Rivian, at a $100 billion valuation, is a company no institutional investor can afford to ignore.', '“They saw what happened with Tesla and know what can happen in this space,” he said.', 'With a $100 billion market cap, every institutional investor in the U.S. and around the world has to take Rivian seriously. And if they own Tesla already, the investors need to make a decision to keep all their Tesla or sell some and buy some Rivian, “just on the off chance that maybe it’s not a Tesla but a half-trillion company, and in that case, it’s a five-bagger from here,” Colas said.', '“We’ve done enough IPOs over the years to know some investors cycle through new companies as they go public, selling the ‘old’ name and replacing it with the ‘new,‘” Colas wrote in a recent note to clients. “Tesla has been the only ‘real’ EV play in U.S. equity markets for years. Now it has competition for the marginal investor.”', 'Rivian is a hot stock, and it is very volatile, and it will continue to be volatile, Colas says, because EV stocks trade more like stock options than underlying stocks.', '“It’s a long-dated option more than a stock,” Colas said. “It’s an option on Rivian being highly successful in EVs. Tesla was the same way earlier in its history, an option on the potential future.”', 'So the recent volatility in Rivian will repeat for reasons other than a Fed-induced growth to value cycle, and investors should remember that options are always more volatile than underlying stocks, and that volatility will move around with how much the market discounts its chances of being highly successful.', 'Trading in Tesla options, as an example, has dwarfed that of the broader market and other mega-cap tech stocks like Amazon, according to a recent FT article.', 'Given the volatility in EVs, investors probably should play both sides of the trade, with some of the exposure to the upstarts, including Telsa and Rivian, and a foothold in the legacy players, “not necessarily because they are going to win the space, but they do have the building blocks that can allow them to win,” Colas said.', 'That’s something Ford’s CEO said last week when it announced that a deal to jointly develop an EV with Rivian was being scrapped (it’s still an investor in the company). Ford CEO Jim Farley referenced the automaker’s “growing confidence” to “win in the electric space” as reasoning to end the collaboration.', 'But the current market approach to valuing EV pure-plays higher than Ford or GM is showing the long-term risk that is in the older automakers.', '“The legacy automakers face some incredible challenges, the likes of which we have never seen, and it makes the incursion of the Japanese and South Korean automakers look small by comparison,” Colas said. “It is a big change in technology that so far they have addressed by building out EVs in-house and leaving the companies combined.”', 'He doesn’t view that approach as an advantage.', 'Right now, the way the market is valuing Tesla, Rivian and Lucid Group relative to Detroit is sending the message to investors that “the combination of the old combustion engine business and EV business tied up in that is not a great investment thesis,” Colas said.', 'The critical factor will be to what degree GM and Ford might ultimately spinoff off EV operations, and that presents one potentially compelling reason to hold onto the shares.', '“The two themes have nothing to do with each other and that breakup is a possibility and one reason you might want to own the stocks,” he said.', 'But he is not confident that Ford or GM will ever make that move, even if the case can be made it’s the right one.', '“GM and Ford still have time left on the clock. But as for a dramatic corporate remake that reflects the existential challenges they face … We’re not holding our breath,” Colas wrote in a recent research note. ', 'If GM and Ford stick to their current corporate structure, Colas sees few to no advantages and one distinct disadvantage: their cost of capital.', 'It is much higher for Ford and GM, both under $100 billion in market cap, than it is for Tesla at $1 trillion. This is the Tesla stock sale that means a lot more to the EV market competition than the recent Musk action.', 'If Tesla needs $10 billion in capital, it can sell $10 billion in stock at 1% dilution for current shareholders. If GM or Ford did that, it’s roughly 10% dilution.', '“That’s how big the difference is in cost of capital. ... GM and Ford’s combined cost of capital and is ridiculously high and unsustainable,” Colas said. “Because the minute the EV industry gets a big tailwind from mass adoption, we will see a lot of new technology come out and all of these companies will have to invest a ton and the big domestic automakers will not be as well positioned as a Rivian or Tesla.”', 'Public filings reviewed by CNBC show that Tesla is spending at least $1 billion on its Austin, Texas-based “Gigafactory.”', 'Electric vehicles eventually imply autonomous vehicles and a reshaping of global transportation. That will require companies to have considerable equity currency for M&A and strategic investments.', '“With where GM and Ford’s stock prices currently sit, they will be bringing a penknife to a gunfight,” Colas wrote in a recent note.', 'This is a big reason why Colas sees a stand-alone valuation for the EV business as an advantage. “It is not that Ford and GM can’t compete in EVs or AVs – they can,” he wrote in a recent note. “It is that their chances improve materially if they can have an equity currency that goes toe–to–toe with Tesla and (now) Apple.” ', 'When it comes to cash to invest in the future of autos, there is a reason why so much speculation surrounds Apple’s interest. With a business generating as much cash as Apple’s quarter after quarter, investors do need to take Apple’s potential entry into the autonomous vehicle and electric vehicle market seriously, Colas says.', 'Apple won’t say anything, with Tim Cook’s most recent comment about cars being another deflection when asked by Andrew Ross Sorkin at the recent Dealbook conference. But Apple did hit a new all-time high last week when Bloomberg reported that Apple’s car plans are accelerating and a debut expected by 2025.', '“Everyone has to pay attention to Apple in autonomous vehicles and EVs if for no other reason than its cash on the balance sheet,” Colas said. “Money doesn’t solve every problem in R&D, but it certainly helps with the ones you know about and so you have to take it seriously if only because they have the resources to do it more than anyone else in the business,” he said.', 'GM and Ford are financially healthy today, generating cash flow from their internal combustion engine operations. “But what happens in the next recession? Or if there is a technological breakthrough in batteries that requires a lot more capital?” Colas wrote in a recent note.', '“In those scenarios, ‘old’ GM and Ford – with a mix of ICE and EV products and a stock valuation to match – are stuck. .. The auto world is nothing if not profoundly capital intensive so this is far from an academic problem.”', 'The flipside of the cash problem, as noted in a recent note on Apple and AVs by Colas, is that investing in autos “has historically been a graveyard for capital.” ', 'But he argues it is too large a market to ignore, and the approach to autos from big technology companies is likely being designed with the expectation of a new economic model focused on “transportation as a service,” not necessarily requiring ownership. “That’s a revenue model any tech company would understand and embrace.”']"
38,Irish trucking firms are taking the pricier route around the UK to avoid Brexit red tape,2021-04-19T05:19:40+0000,"['DUBLIN — As the EU adjusts to its new relationship with the U.K. after Brexit, fewer freight trucks are making the trek across the Irish Sea. ', 'For decades, the route through the U.K. (called a land bridge that takes approximately 15 hours) has been a vital and reliable artery for getting goods from Ireland to mainland Europe.', 'But with the end of the Brexit transition period on Dec. 31, trucks from the Republic of Ireland (which is still an EU member) traveling via the U.K. and entering the mainland through ports like Calais now face a great deal of paperwork and red tape.', 'In the first week of January, operators like Stena Line, Brittany Ferries and Irish Ferries have added extra routes from Ireland to French ports like Dunkirk, Cherbourg and Saint-Malo as well as Bilbao in Spain.', 'Three months into Brexit, port authorities, haulers and ferry operators are coming to grips with this new normal in Irish-European trade.', 'DFDS, the Danish shipping firm, recently added a route between Rosslare Europort in the southeast of Ireland to Dunkirk.', '“In general, we’re oversubscribed in capacity on most of the days,” Aidan Coffey, route director at DFDS, told CNBC.', '“There are three ships at the moment rotating the schedules. That’s going to go up to a fourth ship very shortly.”', 'The journey takes about 24 hours and is longer than it would typically take to drive through the land bridge.', 'Laurence O’Toole is managing director of logistics company O’Toole Transport, which carries various mixed loads on its trucks, including seafood. Pre-Brexit, the majority of its journeys went through the U.K. to reach Europe but now it’s putting more trucks on these new routes.', '“I’d say now it’s flipped on its head completely,” O’Toole said.', 'For Rosslare Europort, the evolving dynamic of freight transport has increased activity at its berths. The port, over 100 miles south of Dublin, has proven a popular location for ferries to link with ports in France and Spain.', 'Glenn Carr, the general manager of Rosslare Europort, told CNBC that demand at the port has surged, but U.K. freight traffic is down about 43%.', '“It’s still very concerning, that level of drop on the U.K. But overall freight through Rosslare Europort, combined U.K. and Europe, is up 51% for the first two months of the year. That type of growth has never been seen in Rosslare,” Carr said.', '“The demand seems to be still increasing. We’re certainly in discussions with possible other operators and other services.”', 'He said ship operators had to move fast in getting routes ready. Typically a route is bedded in and gradually grows in demand over an 18-month period before it reaches capacity, but most journeys are at full capacity now.', '“It’s unprecedented and certainly in talking to the shipping lines they wouldn’t have seen an uptake of a new service like that ever before,” Carr said.', 'However, it is still only three months into this new environment – while coronavirus shocks to trade continue to be felt too – and shippers continue to adjust. It also remains to be seen how much of the land bridge traffic will eventually return in the coming months.', '“But the conversations are about further expansion (of direct routes), it’s not about any contraction,” Carr said.', 'Rosslare Europort has commenced a 35 million euro ($41.3 million) investment plan for renovating and expanding facilities at the port to meet this demand. Works will run over the next four years.', 'In Dublin Port, operators expect that the dock will reach throughput capacity between 2030 and 2040. It has opened a consultation on what its long-term future will look like beyond 2040 as the construction of any additional facilities on the east coast of Ireland would take up to 20 years to design, build and bring into full operation. ', 'These direct routes have not been a total panacea for the challenges Brexit has wrought on Irish freight companies, according to O’Toole.', 'These sailings take longer, often between 18 and 24 hours, and depending on what port a ferry docks in, it can add more miles to a truck’s onward journey.', 'Trucks that land in Cherbourg but whose destination is in Northern France, the Benelux countries, Germany or beyond, face many more miles, hours and fuel costs. Dunkirk meanwhile is close to Calais making for familiar surrounds for drivers used to the land bridge.', '″(Direct routes) are more expensive and they’re slower, which is never good in the transport business,” O’Toole said.', '“It does avoid a whole pile of paperwork but for our customers and ourselves, costs have gone up. We’re trying to get that back off our customers. It’s not easy with Covid, nobody has got money to throw around so we’re trying to keep everything as tight as possible.”', 'He said that direct routes still can’t compete with the efficiencies of the pre-Brexit land bridge.', ' ']"
39,"Elon Musk endorses a carbon tax, downplays concerns about methane",2021-10-08T00:29:14+0000,"['Tesla CEO Elon Musk once again endorsed the idea of a federal carbon tax at the company’s 2021 annual shareholder meeting on Thursday.', 'He said the three parts of a “sustainable future,” in his view, are solar and wind power, batteries for energy storage, and electric vehicles of every kind including cars, boats and airplanes.', '“As we move to a sustainable energy grid and electric vehicles, then obviously we move to a fully sustainable energy economy which is where we want to get to as quickly as possible. The sooner the better! And can there be a carbon tax? I mean like, what the hell,” Musk said Thursday, expressing impatience.', 'A carbon tax, or tax on greenhouse gas emissions, has long been proposed as a way to reduce the emission of gases that cause climate change, particularly carbon dioxide. Some advocates believe that a carbon tax should increase over time to give industry time to discover and roll out lower-carbon alternatives to the products and processes they use that do emit CO2.', 'More than 40 governments have adopted some sort of price on carbon, according to the New York Times, but the United States has not.', 'A carbon tax would help Tesla by making gas more expensive, which would make its electric vehicles more attractive, and by increasing energy prices, which could encourage homeowners to adopt solar panels from Tesla and other providers. Musk acknowledged as much, but noted it would hurt his re-usable rocket business, SpaceX, a considerable consumer of fossil fuels that plans to drill for natural gas and to use methane in its rocket operations in Boca Chica.', '“So how about a carbon tax? We just really need it,” he said.', 'Musk also strongly endorsed the idea of getting more materials out of spent batteries through improved recycling technology and processes.', '“Battery materials are definitely recyclable. Burning gas is not. CO2 is an extremely stable molecule. Mars’ atmosphere has been primarily CO2 for I don’t know billions of years. It’s extremely stable. So, sometimes people worry about methane. Do not worry too much about methane. Methane quickly breaks down into CO2. Methane is not a stable molecule. CO2 is extremely stable,” Musk urged his audience, as if seeking to justify SpaceX’s use of methane.', 'According to the Environmental Protection Agency, “Methane is more than 25 times as potent as carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere.” Methane is also the second most abundant greenhouse gas emitted through human activity and industry, second after carbon dioxide. It accounts for about 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions.', 'At the annual shareholder meeting, Musk also spoke about Tesla’s aim to build cars closer to where customers order them. Doing so can save the company shipping costs, but also reduce its environmental footprint from shipping, Musk suggested.', '“The sheer amount of money we’re spending on flying parts around the world is not great,” Musk said. “It makes sense to have production on the continent where the consumers are.”', 'Currently, Tesla has a new factory underway near Austin, Texas, which is expected to produce batteries on-site, and another outside of Berlin, Germany.', 'On Thursday, Tesla also confirmed that it has moved its headquarters to Austin.', 'Musk expects the Texas factory, dubbed Giga-Austin, to follow in the footsteps of Tesla’s Shanghai factory, which now produces more electric cars than are made in its original factory in Fremont, California.', 'At least year’s annual shareholder meeting, Musk proclaimed that battery and manufacturing advances Tesla is working on could soon lead to lower priced cars from the company. “About 3 years from now, we’re confident we can make a very compelling $25,000 electric vehicle that’s also fully autonomous,” he said then. Tesla also said last year that it designed and was producing its own 4680 battery cells at a facility in Fremont, California.', 'On Thursday, Musk did not give an update on timing for a $25,000 electric vehicle.', 'But he did say that Tesla would not be producing 4680 battery cells in Texas this year. Instead, it would produce these cells at its pilot facility in Fremont, and ship them to Texas to as Model Y production ramps up there.', 'Long-term Musk said he believes the crossover utility vehicle is likely to become Tesla’s best-seller, surpassing the Model 3 sedan in popularity.', 'Earlier this month, Tesla said it delivered 241,300 electric vehicles during the third quarter of 2021, and produced 237,823 cars in the same period.', 'Deliveries are the closest approximation to sales reported by Tesla. The company achieved a new record as other automakers’ deliveries declined compared to the same time last year, owing largely to supply chain issues including a global chip shortage.', 'Musk doesn’t see global supply chain issues resolving fully until 2023, he said Thursday.']"

In the meantime, Astra is expanding its headquarters on the San Francisco Bay while the company prepares for its next launch this summer.', 'A SPAC, or special purpose acquisition company, raises capital in an initial public offering and uses the proceeds to buy a private firm and take it public.', 'CNBC toured Astra’s growing facility earlier this month, a visit which was joined by chairman and CEO Chris Kemp and vice president of manufacturing Bryson Gentile.', 'Benjamin Lyon, executive vice president of engineering, along with senior vice president of factory engineering Pablo Gonzalez and vice president of communications Kati Dahm, also attended.', 'The company’s leadership features a variety of backgrounds from the space and tech industries: Kemp from NASA and cloud software provider OpenStack, and Gentile from SpaceX. Meanwhile Lyon came from Apple, Gonzalez from Tesla, and Dahm from electric vehicle maker NIO.', 'Astra’s facility uses infrastructure left over from the U.S. Navy’s former Air Station Alameda. The company first started out with about 30,000 square feet. It’s now expanding into about 250,000 square feet of space – including all the way out to the edge of the bay, where a newly built city ferry terminal connects Alameda to downtown San Francisco, a 10-minute ride away.', 'The main area of the company’s headquarters, about 25% of its footprint, features an open space for much of its rocket development and assembly.', 'Astra has also put all its equipment on wheels, with the company’s leadership emphasizing the flexibility it wants to maintain as it builds out its production capabilities.', 'Its near-term goal is to reach orbit, the next hurdle after its most recent launch broke the barrier to space in December. The next Astra launch is planned for this summer, which will also be the first to generate revenue for the company.', 'Astra’s rocket stands 40 feet tall, and is capable of carrying up to 100 kilograms to low Earth orbit – putting it in the category of small rockets, a category currently led by Rocket Lab.', 'But Astra’s emphasis is on keeping the price of the rocket as low as possible, with pricing as low as $2.5 million per launch. Rocket Lab prices its Electron rocket at about $7 million per launch, but can lift up to 300 kilograms to low Earth orbit.', 'The company emphasized the cost-cutting methods its implemented into its approach, with Astra believing that it’s feasible to get to a production rate of one rocket per day within a few years. The company’s staff compares its rocket to building a small Cessna aircraft.', 'One example of that Astra showed off during the tour was how it builds it fairings – the nosecone of the rocket that protects satellites during launch.', 'The company said the first fairing it used was made of composite carbon fiber, which is typical in the space industry given how light and stiff the material is. But the carbon fiber fairing cost $250,000, necessitating a different solution since the company wants to eventually get the total cost of its rocket down to less than $500,000.', 'Astra chose to build its second fairing out of metal, which it got down to about $130,000. Yet the company needed to go further.', 'Vice president Gentile explained how the company now uses aluminum tubing to give the fairing its strength, combining that with a dozen petals, which are thin, curved pieces of metal. That’s reduced the cost of the fairings to $33,000.', 'Astra plans to get under $10,000 per fairing, by stamping it rather than riveting it together.', 'Another long-term hurdle for the company will be working with regulators to quickly get licenses for launches if it’s able to reach a daily rate. Astra’s leadership said it is working very closely with the Federal Aviation Administration on how to streamline the licensing process, and noted that it wants to have a dozen or more spaceports around the world as well.', 'Astra is also streamlining the operational aspect of its launches, reducing the number of people in its mission control to less than 10 and only needing six people for setting up the rocket at the physical launch site.', 'Its goal is to reduce the number of people in mission control to just two, effectively a pilot and a co-pilot, by automating most of its processes.', 'Its rocket system, including the strongback which lifts the vehicle vertical for a launch, all packs into a few shipping containers.', 'First, Astra rolls a strongback out of the container and into the factory. Then, an overhead crane drops the rocket straight onto the strongback. Finally, the whole system is rolled into a container and then shipped off.', 'Astra has three strongbacks in assembly, with more to come.', 'The former naval facility also features two engine testing areas, with thick reinforced concrete walls.', 'The evening before the CNBC tour Astra conducted testing on the upper stage of a rocket. This made the engine bay a chilly spot to visit, thanks to the below-freezing temperatures of a liquid oxygen tank.', 'During a hot fire test, when one of Astra’s Delphin rocket engines is fired up, the inside of the chambers reaches 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit. Astra representatives said the company can conduct as many as 10 to 15 tests of a rocket’s first stage in a day, or more than 30 upper-stage tests in a day.', 'Astra will continue to expand its current footprint in Alameda, including a lease for a 500-foot pier and plans for an ocean launch platform that it would be able to load up with a rocket in the bay.', 'Kemp told CNBC in February that Astra’s plan for “daily space delivery” is fully funded through 2025, thanks to the SPAC capital.']"
41,Neal Stephenson on his new geoengineering climate change thriller and coining the term ‘metaverse’,2021-11-14T13:45:19+0000,"['Author Neal Stephenson shot to fame almost 30 years ago with the science-fiction novel “Snow Crash,” which envisioned a future dominated by mega-corporations and organized crime, competing for dominance in both the real world and the “metaverse,” a computer-generated world accessible through virtual reality headsets.', 'Since then, he’s written several more novels encompassing technology and history, including a trilogy set at the dawn of the scientific revolution, and has done work for various technology companies including Jeff Bezos’ space travel company, Blue Origin, and augmented reality company Magic Leap.', 'His new novel, “Termination Shock,” out Nov. 16, focuses on the looming issue of our age -- human-generated climate change, projecting a near future of extreme weather and social chaos. Against this setting, a maverick oilman decides to take matters into his own hands and builds the world’s biggest gun to shoot canisters of sulfur dioxide into the air, echoing the effects of a volcanic eruption and temporarily cooling parts of the globe. Geopolitics, social media and Dutch royalty all play a part.', 'Stephenson acknowledges that geoengineering is a radical step, but suggests as the effects of climate change grow more destructive, the demand for radical solutions will grow.', 'But if geoengineering does happen, it probably won’t be because a billionaire took matters into their own hands.', '“In real life, somebody like that would probably get shut down,” he told CNBC in an interview.', '“By far, the more plausible scenario is that some government somewhere just makes the calculation at some point that doing this would be fairly cheap and easy. And better than not doing it, as far as [their] selfish purposes are concerned.”', 'Personally, he favors an all-of-the-above set of solutions to climate change, including more clean energy sources, decarbonizing the economy and carbon capture to take some of the CO2 we’ve emitted over the last 150 years out of the atmosphere. The trouble is convincing large numbers of people that this kind of action is necessary.', 'He points to two factors that he expects will convince more people that climate change can no longer be ignored. One is rising sea levels.', '“You can be as ideological as you want. But you can’t argue with the fact that your house is full of water,” he says.', '“And the other one is these possible so-called wet-bulb events, where some areas become so hot and humid that everyone who’s outdoors will just die.” Stephenson points to the “heat dome” that descended over the Pacific Northwest last summer, causing temperatures to skyrocket for a few days and killing hundreds of people.', 'He does not necessarily believe governments will come together and agree on solutions, although he says the recent 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, or COP 26, was a necessary and useful event. “We have to have those conferences. And we have to hope and pray that their strongest and most optimistic recommendations are put into effect.”', 'But even if they can’t agree, governments will be forced to respond.', '“I think we’ll see the big governments, the Indias and Chinas of the world, charting their own path,” he says. “At the end of the day, most politicians want to retain their power. And they’re going to do what it takes to keep getting votes or to maintain their grip on on the political system. And if they’re seen as having presided over huge apocalyptic disasters and not taking effective action, then they’re in trouble.”', 'Although he was one of the first writers to popularize the idea of virtual reality, he does not necessarily believe that people will retreat into artificial worlds as the real world becomes harder to live in.', '“I don’t hate VR,” he says. “But the reality has been so far that most people don’t like to hang out there for more than a short period of time. That may change as the technology gets better, but there’s just inherent limitations on things like the problem of getting motion sickness, the problem of how do you move around?”', 'He’s more bullish on augmented reality -- the idea pioneered by Magic Leap and currently being developed by Microsoft, Apple, and others, where computer-generated images are blended with the real world. But he agrees it won’t take off until there’s a good reason for people to wear headsets or glasses for long periods of time. “It’ll probably have something to do with making it even smaller, more compact, and less of an intrusive experience to wear around.”', 'As far as the metaverse goes, Stephenson has stood back and watched as the tech and business worlds have claimed the term for themselves, most notably the company formerly known as Facebook, which renamed itself Meta to emphasize its interest in building a computer-generated universe.', '“All I can do is kind of sit back and watch it in amazement,” he said. But, as many have noticed, “There’s a pretty big gap between what Facebook is actually doing, like running Facebook and WhatsApp and Instagram, and the visions that they’re talking about for the metaverse.”', 'Here’s a transcript of the complete interview, lightly edited for clarity and length.', 'Matt Rosoff, CNBC: The plot of your new novel “Termination Shock” is essentially about a maverick businessperson using geoengineering to reverse climate change. For CNBC readers who may not be familiar with the concept of geoengineering, can you tell us a little bit about it?', 'Neal Stephenson, author: The first point to emphasize is that it doesn’t fix the actual problem, which is too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. But it’s thought that it could be a stopgap way to slow down the rate at which the climate gets hotter.', 'And it’s basically imitating the effects of large volcanic eruptions by putting sulfur dioxide or something else into the atmosphere, right?', 'Exactly. There have been many cases throughout history where a big volcano -- most recently, Pinatubo in the Philippines -- does exactly this. And it puts particles or droplets of sulfates into the stratosphere, and those sort of act as a veil that bounces back a little bit of the sun’s radiation back into space so that it never reaches our planet and doesn’t warm us up. So we know that this cools the planet down because it’s happened a bunch of times throughout history. And we also know that the sulfates will kind of naturally wash out of the atmosphere in a couple of years. And you go back to where you were before.', 'So you almost need a constant infusion of them. While you decarbonize.', 'Exactly. The only sane way to use this, if it’s done at all, is as a way to buy time for decarbonization, which is what we really need to do.', 'How did you get interested in this subject and become fascinated with it enough to base a novel on it?', 'I’ve been hearing about the idea for a number of years. I’m interested in history. I’m interested in science and the physics of the planet. And so, the idea that a volcano could erupt somewhere and affect temperatures all over the planet is a natural, fascinating topic for me. Over the last decade or two, it’s become increasingly clear that the CO2 content in the atmosphere is a huge problem, and that it’s getting worse fast, and we’re not really being very effective. Despite efforts by a number of people to draw attention to the problem and and push for emissions reductions, that number is still climbing rather rapidly and probably will keep climbing for a while. So rolling that together in the brain of the science fiction novelist, that looks like the basis for a story that that’s got that technical angle to it, but that’s also got a strong geopolitical and personal storytelling basis.', 'Do you think it’s a realistic likelihood that this could happen in 10 to 15 years? Maybe a maverick individual, but more likely a government that doesn’t particularly care much about world opinion will take it into their own hands?', 'I agree. In this book, it’s the maverick billionaire because it makes for a good story. But I have to do a lot of explaining as to how he’s able to get away with it, because in real life, somebody like that would probably get shut down. By far, the more plausible scenario is that some government somewhere just makes the calculation at some point that doing this would be fairly cheap and easy. And better than not doing it as far as [their] selfish purposes are concerned.', 'It’s considered a pretty radical out-there idea. If you look at the overall landscape and what you’ve been seeing over the last few years, what do you think the likelihood of countries in industry and individuals voluntarily taking steps to reduce emissions enough to keep global warming to a minimum? Or how do you think it’s likely to play out over the next 10 to 15 years?', 'The number that matters is the CO2 in the atmosphere, which is above 400 parts per million and climbing, That’s higher than it’s been in millions of years. So when we talk about emissions reductions, all we’re saying is that the rate at which that number grows, will slow down. But it’s still growing, the numbers still get higher every year. It’s just not climbing as fast because we reduced our emissions. If we could get to zero emissions, which might happen in a few decades -- like China’s saying maybe by 2060, it might get to zero emissions. That just means that that number stays wherever it is, for about a million years, which is how long it takes natural processes to remove it. So emissions reductions are great and zero emissions would be better than than not doing that, but still leaves us stuck with the number at a dangerously high level until we take active measures to remove that carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.', 'What do you think of carbon capture as a technology? Have you followed it at all?', 'I know an increasing number of people who are techies who are altering their careers to think about this and work on this. There’s a bunch of ways that it could be done. We have to do it. It will be the biggest engineering project by far in human history. We have to do it. We have to succeed. And it’ll take many decades.', 'Did you follow the COP26 conference at all? What did you think of it?', 'I followed it. Not super closely. But all of that stuff is great. We have to have those conferences. And we have to hope and pray that their strongest and most optimistic recommendations are put into effect. For sure. It’s just while we’re doing that, we can’t lose sight of what I said before, which is that reducing emissions or taking emissions to zero still doesn’t begin to solve the problem. It just means that we’re not making the problem worse.', 'What about other forms of energy? Nuclear energy in particular is one that draws a lot of interest from from readers. It’s zero carbon, but there’s fear about it, and some of that fear is grounded. What about that and other energy forms? ', 'Nuclear, I think during the Cold War it kind of got rushed into service, too soon. And before the whole picture was was fully understood. So it’s not where where the engineering resources have been going in the last few decades. And with more resources, more engineers, more money, maybe we can find ways to do it that are that are safer. There are still intractable problems around what to do with nuclear waste, and and so on that need attention. But we’re entering into this phase in our history where we have to start thinking in terms of relative risks. If you’re talking about a particular new technology, they have to compare its risk to the risk of not using it. ', 'There’s a lot going on that’s promising. Beyond just nuclear, there’s geothermal and the usual suspects, wind, solar, etc. And we need it all.', 'A lot of these discussions get bogged down by ideological purity tests. So one one side you’ve got activists who say if you even talk about adaptation, that’s wrong. Because you’re giving up on reduction. And if you even talk about carbon capture, you’re just giving the current economy and the current fossil fuel industry more more leeway to keep burning. Then you’ve got other people, the Bjorn Lomborgs of the world, who say, “Oh, we’re focusing way too much on the risks and not talking about the costs enough, and growth is the only way out.” How do you think about this? How do you parse this when you’re looking at all of these different, really strong ideological beliefs?', 'Yeah, a whole separate dimension to the problem that we’re facing is weird, weird polarization of everything. It’s incredibly obstructive. There was just an article in The New York Times about Republicans who are furious at other Republicans who voted for the infrastructure bill. Like, how dare you vote for bridges?', 'It’s really disheartening and seems like it’s definitely this partisan shift by bad actors who think they’re gaining something from it.', 'I personally can look at something like carbon capture, and I can make an argument that convinces me that we should be doing it, so it’s not hard for me to formulate my own opinion on that. Much harder is getting millions and millions of other people to agree.', 'What do you think will be the tipping point? I’ve noticed a lot more people coming around to the idea that we need a multifaceted, throw-everything-at-it solution. And I think some of that comes as the effects become harder and harder to ignore, so it’s harder to presume that this is just happening somewhere else. Do you imagine some kind of event, or series of events, that can break this logjam?', 'So here’s an example. We had this heat dome event in Seattle over the summer, where out of nowhere, from a normal summer’s day, just suddenly, it was 115 degrees. Much hotter than it has ever been in Seattle.', 'I grew up there, and lived there for 10 years as an adult as well. So yeah, that was staggering.', 'So that happened overnight, and after three days of that, overnight, the temperature dropped by 50 degrees. A bunch of people died. So I think an event like that might convince a bunch of people who live in Seattle.', 'But I think one is going to be rising sea levels, which is something you can’t argue with. You can be as ideological as you want. But you can’t argue with the fact that your house is full of water.', 'And the other one is these possible so-called wet-bulb events, where some areas become so hot and humid that everyone who’s outdoors will just die.', 'How can people come together to ensure that solutions help the broadest number of people, rather than pulling up the drawbridges -- let’s just escape into space or our compound in New Zealand or something like that? Or do you think it’s inevitable that the people with the means are going to run?', 'Of course, some people are going to do that. And other parts of the world are going to be depopulated one way or the other. But I think we’ll see the big governments, the Indias and Chinas of the world, charting their own path, going their own way, doing what they think they need to do, in order to basically prevent their their governments from falling. At the end of the day, most politicians want to retain their power. And they’re going to do what it takes to keep getting votes or to maintain their grip on on the political system. And if they’re seen as having presided over huge apocalyptic disasters and not taking effective action, then they’re in trouble.', 'I have to ask about the metaverse, a term that you coined in the book “Snow Crash” in 1992. Now it’s everywhere in tech. It was on Disney’s earnings call! Everybody in the tech world is suddenly using the term, probably not the way you intended it or originally envisioned it. What are your thoughts on that?', 'I have to assume that some of this is pre-emptive. Making sure that one company -- that Facebook -- doesn’t establish a trademarkable position. If they begin to throw the term around, and nobody else does, then they might be able to later prevent other people from from using the term. So that might be part of why they’re doing this.', 'I don’t know. All I can do is kind of sit back and watch it in amazement.', 'There’s a pretty big gap between what Facebook is actually doing, like running Facebook and WhatsApp and Instagram, and the visions that they’re talking about for the metaverse. They’re two very different things. That’s important to keep in mind.', 'I had a conversation with a VC maybe six or seven years ago, and he was sort of a pessimist in general about the course of humanity and where things are going. He said, “Hey, you know, if you’re a pessimist, VR seems like a great bet. Because everybody’s going to want to escape from their real world conditions.” Do you see things that way at all?', 'I’m personally more interested in AR than in VR. I mean, I don’t hate VR. But the reality has been so far that most people don’t like to hang out there for more than a short period of time. That may change as the technology gets better, but there’s just inherent limitations on things like the problem of getting motion sickness, the problem of how do you move around? I mean, while I’m talking to you, I’m just kind of wandering around my house. And that’s a normal human thing to do, to want to get up and move around. That’s a difficult thing to do in a VR environment because you’ll step on your cat.', 'I know you were involved with Magic Leap, and that seems to have gone in a different direction with Peggy Johnson in charge, focusing on enterprise a lot, like Microsoft has, but what’s it going to take for for AR to really take off? What are the technological barriers? I look at how mobile was with Windows Mobile and Palm and some of those things, and then all of a sudden, the iPhone had enough new things in it, the capacitive touch screen and the idea of apps, that it was 18 months ahead of everybody else. And that was enough for it to take off. Is there something like that, that would have to happen for AR to take off?', 'I think that’s a good analogy. Somewhere out there is that tipping point. And nobody knows where it is until they’ve found it. And so timing is tricky. I think what Magic Leap accomplished in the way of hardware is impressive. I mean, they’re shipping a headset with a 6D controller and a whole system that tracks the room around you. And it makes it possible for applications to interact with things that it sees in your environment. And there’s a lot of engineering that has to happen to make those things all work together in a package that doesn’t immediately catch on fire or run out of batteries.', 'I actually saw [former Oculus CTO John] Carmack tweeted, not about Magic Leap, but he was saying maybe what VR headsets need is a big heat exchanger that would sit on top of your head. ', 'So engineering-wise, I think it’s been going pretty well. The question is what will prompt people to want to wear something like this all day long and make it just a routine thing to carry around. And it’ll probably have something to do with making it even smaller, more compact, and less of an intrusive experience to wear around.', 'You’ve been writing about technology for about three decades now. When you look back at when you started this, when the internet was young, what has surprised you and what do you think you’ve been right about? What did you anticipate, and what did you not anticipate?', 'The popularity early on of relatively simple forms of the internet, just simple web browsers with words and pictures, and how catchy that was, how rapidly people adopted it. That was a surprise to me because as a techie, I wanted to have more splashy kinds of technologies like full 3D immersive experiences. Who knew that reading a few words on a webpage and maybe seeing a grainy JPEG would be so transformative?', 'On the not-so-happy side, the speed with which and the completeness with which it was taken over by bad actors. I remember when Obama was elected. People were saying, ‘Well, you know, Obama’s team, they understood the internet, they understood how to use the internet. And Republicans, they’re old. And they don’t get it. So they’ve been left in the dust.’ And then eight years later, not only did they get it, but they got way in a way deeper, and much more kind of cynical way than the Democrats had.', 'I know that there’s an HBO adaptation of “Snow Crash” in the works, maybe coming out this year. I haven’t heard much about it recently, can you talk about that?', 'The reason you haven’t heard about it is because they passed on it in June. So it’s no longer an HBO Max project. It’s reverted to Paramount. And Kennedy/Marshall.', 'Are we going to see it soon?', 'All I can say is stay tuned. A lot of people want it to happen.']"

That compares to a 0.8% jump in November, or a 6.8% gain year-over-year, the highest since 1982.', 'Excluding food and energy, CPI is expected to have risen 0.5% or 5.4% year-over-year, when the Labor Department releases the data Wednesday at 8:30 a.m. ET.', '“Sometime in the next couple of months, we think inflation will have peaked, in December or some time in the first quarter,” said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. “We do expect inflation to slow in 2022. We expect prices to go up more slowly in 2022 than they did in 2021. We don’t have the same stimulus. We expect some weaker spending and supply chain issues are not going to be fully resolved, but we think we have passed the peak in some of those shipping supply chains.”', 'Economists disagree on exactly when inflation will peak, but it’s well past the initial time frame the Federal Reserve had expected to see when it dubbed inflation “transitory” or temporary. The Fed now forecasts three quarter-point interest rate hikes this year to battle inflation.', '“It’s still hot, hot, hot, and it’s important because we’re now where the Fed worries about that 7% number getting baked into wages and getting more entrenched,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. “You’ve got the Fed in panic instead of patient mode, so the risk is overshooting... We’re now in a position of the Fed chasing instead of anticipating. It’s worrisome.”', 'Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell Tuesday told a Senate panel that the central bank will use its tools to mitigate rising prices if it sees more persistent inflation.', '“If we see inflation persisting at high levels longer than expected, then if we have to raise interest more over time, we will,” Powell said. “We will use our tools to get inflation back.”', 'Inflation data has repeatedly surprised to the upside. Economists say there’s a risk for an even faster pace in Wednesday’s report.', '“If it’s hotter than expected, it’s kind of a validation of the path the Fed has already put themselves on,” said Tilley. Besides raising interest rates, Powell said Tuesday that the central bank could begin to shrink its balance sheet this year, another step toward tighter policy.', 'Kevin Cummins, chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets, said the peak in consumer headline inflation could be this month, and he notes the make-up in inflation this year is shifting.', '“Last year, it was all on the goods side. We saw a pick-up in core goods in our forecast. We have it shifting from used cars and commodity prices. Now it’s shifting toward rents which are stickier,” he said. “We have inflation kind of holding in around 3% this year partly because of rent and also broader wage pressures that are building because the labor market is getting as hot as it is.”', 'Cummins expects CPI to be rising at 3% by the end of the year. He said rents have been climbing over the past two years. Rent costs, together with hotel costs and owners’ equivalent rent are the shelter component of the consumer price index and are about 30% of headline CPI, he noted.', 'For 2022, Cummins expects rents to rise 4.5% year-over-year, after rising 3.4% in 2021. In 2020, the pace of rent increases slowed to 1.9% from 3.3% in 2019, he noted.

With Take-Two agreeing to buy Zynga for $3.50 a share in cash and $6.36 a share in stock, Pincus is poised to pocket about $193 million while still owning roughly $350 million worth of Take-Two equity.', 'Take-Two’s purchase price equates to a premium of 64% to Zynga’s closing price on Friday, giving Pincus’s net worth a big boost.', 'Still, this isn’t how the story was supposed to unfold.', 'Prior to its IPO in 2011, Zynga was about the hottest ticket in Silicon Valley. Its flagship game, FarmVille, was printing cash, as consumers spent real money building digital worlds and dressing up their avatars. In the first three quarters of 2011, revenue surged to almost $830 million, up seven-fold from full-year revenue in 2009. FarmVille accounted for 27% of sales.', 'Paul Martino, a venture investor who backed the game developer in its first financing round in 2007 said that, between 2008 and 2011, Zynga got more chatter than any other company in Silicon Valley. In particular, during the financial crisis, venture capitalists weren’t putting money into much of anything, but Zynga was still raising cash.', 'Heading into the IPO, Kleiner Perkins was so bullish on Zynga that in early 2011 it increased its stake by buying shares at $14, valuing the company at $12 billion. The stock debuted below that, at $10, and surpassed $14 a few times in early 2012.', 'But Zynga’s early growth relied entirely on Facebook — the company’s games spread virally by using the social network for distribution. When Facebook started exerting greater control over the platform, it limited third-party developers from promoting their services, exposing Zynga’s principal weakness. Between 2012 and 2014, Zynga’s revenue fell by half.', 'The stock lost 75% of its value in 2012 and never fully recovered.', '“Once it became such a big success out of the gate, there was belief that Zynga could transcend being a game company into being so much more,” said Martino, a managing partner at Bullpen Capital. “But ultimately, it’s a game company and got bought as a game company.”', 'Martino admitted that the stock performance was disappointing. Even with the high premium Take-Two is paying, it’s still less than the IPO price.', '“But if you told us in 2007 that the company would be bought at a $12-$13 billion number, I have to imagine we probably would have been pretty happy about that,” he said.', 'Pincus’s one big stock sale came at the right time, for him, and drew the ire of other investors. In April 2012, as part of a secondary offering, Pincus sold $192 million worth of shares at $12 apiece, representing about 15% of his total stake. Many shareholders were still in post-IPO lockup at the time and didn’t have that option.', 'Pincus and the other insiders who sold in the offering were sued by stockholders, who claimed they “suffered colossal losses on their investments,” while those at the top were able to sell before the drop. Zynga eventually settled for $23 million.', 'From that point until late 2018, Pincus held onto his remaining shares. He sold just about $70 million worth of shares between 2018 and 2021, in part for estate planning for his kids, according to a representative for Pincus. The only other significant change to his ownership was in connection to his 2017 divorce.', 'Holding was a lucrative decision, even as the company faced turmoil and uncertainty.', 'Pincus stepped down as CEO in 2013, when Zynga named Don Mattrick, who had been Microsoft’s Xbox business, as his successor. Pincus stayed on as chairman and assumed the role of chief product officer.', 'Two years after that announcement, Pincus reclaimed the CEO position, a move that was panned by Wall Street — the stock sank 18%. Here’s what Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a report after that announcement:', '“Mr. Pincus has a spotty record with investors, given Zynga’s struggles in the latter portion of his previous stint as CEO; we believe the lack of investor confidence resulted in Zynga shares trading down significantly in after-market trading.”', 'Less than a year after his return, Pincus again gave up the CEO job, this time handing the reins to Frank Gibeau, an executive at Electronic Arts. Pincus remained the chairman.', 'The stock has since climbed 300%, including Monday’s rally on news of the Take-Two deal.', '“One of the toughest challenges for any company is a successful partnership between its founder and CEO,” Pincus wrote, in a blog post after the announcement. “Over these past 6 years I’ve been lucky to have that with Frank Gibeau. He has taught me a lot about managing at scale. Frank and I have always said that we agree 80% of the time, and the other 20% has led to some of our best insights.”', 'Zynga was able to revive itself by moving beyond social games like FarmVille, largely through acquiring the developers of popular titles like Words with Friends, CSR Racing and Toy Blast.', 'But Pincus, who is now a managing partner at investment firm Reinvent Capital, never abandoned his love for the thing that got him started: Poker.', 'Prior to the outbreak of Covid-19, Pincus held Zynga poker nights at his house, setting up several tables of Texas Hold’em and treating his guests to catered food. Martino said he last attended a poker night at Pincus’s house in early 2020.', '“He’s done that for years,” Martino said. “He does a great job.

The sheds are the result of Kroger’s deal with British online grocer Ocado to use technology to quickly fill customers’ e-commerce orders and do that in a more profitable way.', 'One shed is in Monroe, Ohio — close to Kroger’s Cincinnati headquarters — and the other is in Groveland, Florida — a fast-growing city about 30 miles west of Orlando. CNBC had a chance to look inside the facility as it reported on how the grocer is trying to build an online grocery delivery business in Florida, where it has only one store.', 'For Kroger, the sheds are a huge investment. Each one costs a minimum of $55 million to build. It’s a risky bet, especially when one considers it has to share a portion of each sale with Ocado. To pay off for Kroger, its online business must grow rapidly.', 'Here’s a closer look at how Kroger is using its Florida shed to get groceries to customers, based on a tour of the facility and interviews with company leaders:', 'Each shed is stocked with about 31,000 different grocery, personal-care and household items. Trucks pull up to industrial-sized, warehouse doors to unload pallets of cereal, soup, vegetables, packs of paper towels and more. They are ferried by forklift to a decant station.', 'Once there, employees unwrap the pallets and break down the shipping boxes. They scan and sort items of the same type into plastic totes — almost like stocking a giant, high-tech vending machine.', 'Key pieces of information about each tote are typed into a computer, including the number of items it contains and product expiration dates. The automated system uses the data to monitor inventory levels and flag products that are at risk of going bad or falling short of Kroger’s standards. (For instance, Kroger guarantees 10 days of freshness for milk.)', 'Meanwhile, another group of employees load delivery totes with blue plastic bags. These containers will be used to collect items for customer orders.', 'The engine of each shed is a high-tech grid of roughly 200,000 plastic totes. The totes are stacked on top of one another in rows. Some are full of items that haven’t yet been doled out for a customer, such as loose onions, boxes of Pampers diapers or bags of gummy worms. Others are empty. And a third category is filled with bagged groceries picked out for a customer.', 'Totes shuffle around like a game of Tetris. From a bird’s-eye view, the grid — or hive — is about the same size as a football field. It is made up of two sides: a chilled side for perishable items and an ambient side for shelf-stable consumer packaged goods and household items.', 'Totes are color-coded. White totes are “hive totes” that stay in the grid. They get filled and emptied of inventory — but are never used as a delivery receptacle for a customer.', 'Other smaller totes go inside of those “hive totes.” Red totes hold refrigerated and ambient temperature items. Blue totes are used for frozen items.', 'Meat goes into a yellow tote. Fruits and vegetables go in a green one. And anything that could contaminate food items, such as deodorant and laundry detergent, goes into an orange tote.', 'Some groceries get an extra layer of protection. For example, bunches of bananas stay in a cardboard box inside of the tote to minimize the risk they will get squished.', 'All are gobbled up by the grid-based system, which is made up of conveyer belts and chutes.', 'The hive remains active nearly round-the-clock. An overnight shift from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. tends to be the busiest. That’s when employees pick groceries for next-day deliveries. There’s also a day shift from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m. From 5 p.m. to 9 p.m., the grid can be down for any maintenance that’s needed.', 'Behind the scenes, Ocado’s software powers robots in an elaborate choreography. Robots roughly the size of a dishwasher glide on top of the grid of plastic totes. Each has wheels that allow them to go four directions and a metal, tape measure-like ribbon at each of its four corners.', 'Almost like a carnival game, the robots can unwind the metal-like tape, hook onto the tote and snatch it into its belly from multiple yards away.', 'The robots run this intricate storage-and-retrieval system. They move around the totes and come up with best routes to get them to outbound lanes or inbound lanes, so that employees can fill them up with inventory and process customers’ orders.', 'Frozen items are not part of either grid. Instead, they are kept in a large, walk-in freezer that is kept at minus 10 degrees. Employees hand pick pizzas, pints of ice cream, microwavable dinners and more. Those items get put into foam-lined blue totes along with dry ice to keep them cold on the delivery route.', 'In the middle of the hive, employees stand at pick stations. Some work on the ambient side, which is kept at about 70 degrees. Others pick in an area that resembles the inside of a refrigerator at 34 degrees. Here most employees wear heavy coats and winter hats. On the chilled side, the grid is much smaller — eight totes deep versus 21 deep — since each item that goes into a tote has a much shorter shelf life.', 'Employees at pick stations have a conveyer belt next to them that serves up totes full of the items that they need to grab for a customer. They stand in front of a counter area that spits out three different totes at a time to fill with customers’ purchases.', 'Each employee’s computer screen shows which items should go with a customer’s order. A green light also appears above the correct tote and a small screen shows the quantity of the item to add to the bag. They scan items, much like a cashier would at the store.', 'The software that powers the entire grid helps group together similar orders, such as pairing customers who ordered the same kind of ketchup or yogurt. It also tells the system how to pick, so that fragile items like loaves of bread and cartons of eggs are last.', 'When an employee is done filling a batch of totes, they press a button and the containers get gobbled back up by the grid.', 'Along the way, Kroger has multiple checkpoints to catch moldy fruit, leaking milk or other problems that can leave a bad impression — and potentially, scare away customers. One of those is a backroom where employees soak lettuce, store asparagus stems in water, comb through containers of strawberries and do other kinds of quality checks.', 'It also has a team of quality assurance employees who monitor the pick stations and do spot checks. Employees at pick stations are also encouraged to flag any items that don’t look or smell right.', 'When customers’ groceries are done being picked, red and blue totes travel to the end of a conveyer belt to a station for outbound orders. They are spit out in a sequence, so an entire customer order is together — regardless of items’ temperatures. Orders heading to a similar destination are grouped together, too, so they wind up in the same delivery van.', 'The outbound station is on the chilled side of the facility for quality control.', 'Totes are loaded into metal frames on wheels and loaded into the back of a temperature-controlled delivery van. Each van has a refrigerated section and a room temperature section to make sure chocolate doesn’t melt and six-packs of beer arrive cold.

But, starting next year, the shipping industry will have to comply with rules that should dramatically reduce sulfur emissions.', '“It is the biggest change in oil market history,” Steve Sawyer, senior analyst at energy consultant Facts Global Energy, told CNBC.', '“It is going to affect crude oil producers, traders, ship owners, refiners, equity investors, insurance companies, logistical businesses, banks… Who’s left? I’m struggling to think of anyone it might not affect. That’s why it is a huge transition,” Sawyer said.', 'With less than six months to go before the new rules on marine fuels come into force, CNBC takes a look at the far-reaching consequences of the coming changes.', 'On January 1, 2020, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) will enforce new emissions standards designed to significantly curb pollution produced by the world’s ships.', 'Amid a broader push towards cleaner energy markets, the IMO is set to ban shipping vessels using fuel with a sulfur content higher than 0.5%, compared to levels of 3.5% at present.', 'The most commonly used marine fuel is thought to have a sulfur content of around 2.7%.', 'The new regulations are the result of a recommendation that came from a subcommittee at the United Nations (UN) more than a decade ago and was adopted in 2016 by the UN’s IMO, which sets rules for shipping safety, security and pollution.', 'More than 170 countries, including the U.S., have signed on to the fuel change.', 'Starting in 2020, ships found in violation of the new laws risk being impounded and ports in cooperating countries are expected to police visiting vessels.', '“It is an enormous switch. If you considered shipping alongside all of the oil consuming nations, it would be number four or five on the list — so it is an enormous amount of consumption,” Anthony Gurnee, CEO of Ardmore Shipping, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” last week.', 'Ardmore Shipping is a U.S.-listed company based in Ireland, with a business of owning and operating a fleet of tankers that move refined oil products.', '“We are going to a fundamentally different type of fuel. It is having a bigger impact actually on the refining industry than it is on shipping,” Gurnee said.', 'The forthcoming measures are widely expected to create an oversupply of high-sulfur fuel oil while sparking demand for IMO-compliant products — thus ratcheting up the pressure on the refining industry to produce substantially more of the latter.', 'This is especially important, energy analysts say, because Middle Eastern oil producers — such as OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia — are likely to lose out given their over-reliance on crude with a high-sulfur content.', 'The shipping industry is under intense pressure to slash its sulfur emissions, given the pollutant is a component of acid rain, which harms vegetation and wildlife, and contributes to the acidification of the oceans.', 'The proposed rule change comes at a time when the stakes are high for the world’s shipping vessels. Late last year, analysts at UBS estimated the green shipping market could be worth at least $250 billion over the next five years.', 'In a word: no.', 'The IMO has said there can now be no change to the implementation date, as it is too late for any revisions to take place before January 1, 2020.', 'Ship owners can significantly reduce their sulfur emissions by using low-sulfur fuel, traveling more slowly, installing exhaust gas cleaning systems or opting for other — more expensive — clean fuels such as liquefied natural gas.', 'Some ships will chose to limit the air pollutants by installing exhaust gas cleaning systems, known as “scrubbers.” These are designed to remover sulfur oxides from the ship’s engine and boiler exhaust gases.', 'A ship fitted with a scrubber could continue to use heavy oil, since the sulfur oxide emissions would be reduced to a level equivalent to the required limit.', 'Analysts estimate the container industry — which transports consumer goods such as sofas, designer clothes and bananas — is likely to be among those hit the hardest, with additional costs of approximately $10 billion, according to a Reuters report.', 'The world’s two largest container shipping lines, A.P. Moller-Maersk and MSC, have both reportedly said that falling in line with IMO regulations is likely to incur extra costs of roughly $2 billion each.', '“I am a firm believer that the market will find a balance,” Sawyer said.', '“Let me put it this way, there is a brick wall coming at the end of December which has been built for over two years. I think you can either run into it head first and say: ‘that hurts,’ or you can find a way around it.”', '— CNBC’s Patti Domm contributed to this report.']"

54,Facebook Portal Go review: A great portable video calling screen marred by the company’s privacy and trust issues,2021-10-19T14:58:13+0000,"['Facebook’s new Portal video calling devices hit stores and began shipping to customers on Tuesday. I’ve been testing out the new portable Portal Go for the past week.', 'The $199 Portal Go is part of Facebook’s third generation of Portal devices that the company announced last month. Facebook is still pretty green when it comes to putting together hardware products, but the social media company has made strides in its design and execution since releasing its first Portal devices in 2018. Since then, Facebook has also introduced Portal devices that attach to your TV, and mini versions that look like picture frames. The Portal Go is the first of these products that can be moved around and it works without being plugged into a wall.', 'Along with the new Portal+, the Portal Go is Facebook’s first redesign of its video calling device since 2019, and in that time, it shows that Facebook has only gotten better a putting together hardware products.', 'Facebook has never broken out sales figures for its Portal devices, so it’s hard to say how successful these products are. In its financial results, the company includes Portal within its “Other” revenue stream, which also includes its Oculus virtual reality headsets and Workplace enterprise communication software businesses. Since the fourth quarter of 2018 when the first Portal devices were released, Facebook’s Other revenue has grown nearly 223% from $274 million to close to $885 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.', 'Unfortunately, for everything there is to like about the Portal Go — I like the big 10.1-inch screen, the portability and the speakers — the device is made by Facebook, and over the past several years, the social media company has wrecked its trust with its users, lawmakers worldwide and consumers at large. The Portal Go is fantastic for video calling, but do you really want a Facebook-controlled camera in your home?', 'Here’s what you need to know.', 'The Facebook Portal Go is a device designed for video calling that you can easily move around your home, and for that specific task, the Portal Go works perfectly.', 'In my testing of the gadget, I was able to use the Portal Go to call friends and family via Messenger and WhatsApp. The Portal Go would ring if they called me, and I could accept by touching the screen. I could initiate calls by searching for my friends on the device.', 'The Portal Go sits on a charging mount when not in use, but as soon as you have a call to make, you can grab it by the handle notch hidden in its posterior and move it wherever you need to go. At times I chatted with friends while on the move, but often, I would simply take the Portal Go and sit it on my coffee table, my bed or my kitchen counter. Once situated, I was able to enjoy my video call hands-free.', 'I liked that I could use it while relaxing on the couch and then pick it up and continue my call while cooking. Short video calls can be fine on a phone, but anything longer than five minutes is better situated for a dedicated video calling device like the Portal Go.', 'Amazon has the $249.99 Echo Show and Google offers the $229 Nest Hub Max, but none of those devices are portable, forcing you to make your video call in whatever spot where you connected your gadget to an outlet (hopefully you picked somewhere comfortable).', 'Portability might seem like a small difference, but that feature distinguishes the Portal Go.', 'I received a call on the Portal Go while my partner was working in the same room. So I picked up the Portal Go and moved to a different room. We also tried the Portal Go to call my partner’s family during their weekly dinner. They were able to position their Portal Go testing device at the head of their table, making us feel like part of the dinner.', 'With a 10.1-inch screen and an excellent speaker system, the Portal Go makes video calls that are crystal clear in both visuals and sound. You can easily hear whoever you are chatting with whether you’re leaning in during the call or sitting back.', 'As for battery life, we never came close to running out of juice during a call, but Facebook told CNBC that the Portal Go has enough battery to last up to five hours of one-on-one calling via Messenger or 14 hours of listening with its screen off.', 'Like other Portal devices, the Go also includes augmented reality features that can be used to make funny faces, add colorful backgrounds or change up the sound of your voice. These features keep calls interesting and would be especially entertaining for kids.', 'My other favorite use of the Portal Go was uploading pictures onto it to use it as a digital picture frame — pictures look gorgeous on the Portal Go’s display.', 'My biggest complaint about the Portal Go is the fact that it’s made by Facebook.', 'It’s very difficult to trust Facebook with a device that has a camera and microphones in your home.', 'Fortunately, the Portal has a cover that you can slide over its camera whenever it’s not in use, and you can also press a button that will electronically turn off its camera and microphones. But that doesn’t change the fact that Facebook made the device, and time after time, Facebook has violated its users’ trust. Just last month, a whistleblower leaked internal documents that showed the company knew that Instagram is hurting teenagers’ mental health and was doing nothing to alert the public about it.', '“Our track record in the market is ultimately how we’ll build trust,” Facebook’s head of product management for Portal Micah Collins said when asked about the privacy concerns.', 'The Portal would already be a hit if it was made by Samsung, Apple or pretty much any other major hardware tech company. They’re fantastic for what they were designed for. Anyone who is concerned about trusting Facebook with their privacy has every right to feel that way.', 'It’s also missing a lot of features.', 'It doesn’t have Netflix, YouTube, HBO Max or basically any video-streaming service that you would want on a device with a screen as gorgeous as the Portal Go’s. This was also the case with the original Portals that launched in 2018, but it feels like an even more pertinent absence now that the Portal Go is a portable gadget. I’d be more willing to buy it if I could do video calls, have a digital photo frame and watch my favorite shows all for $199. You can, however, watch content on Facebook Watch, if that’s something you ever feel like trying out.', 'Among the few apps worth using on the device are the audio-streaming services, which include Spotify, Pandora and iHeartRadio. I tried out the Spotify app and was quite impressed by the audio quality of the Portal Go. Unfortunately, the Spotify app was extremely disappointing. There’s no search function, so you’re limited to listening to whatever playlists the app recommends to you. It feels like someone developed the Spotify app for the Portal and then forgot about it.', 'The Portal Go is a fantastic video calling device with much-needed portability built-in as its signature feature. I recommend the Portal Go for anyone who makes frequent video calls. If you’re like me and live far away from many of your relatives and loved ones, the Portal Go is fantastic for keeping in touch. And at $199, the Portal Go makes for an excellent gift idea with the holidays coming up.', 'Unfortunately, Facebook’s repeated and frequent trust issues with the public and lawmakers make it incredibly hard to trust the company with a device that relies so heavily on a camera and microphones. If you can bring yourself to trust Facebook with a camera in your living room, the Portal Go is an excellent device. But I don’t blame you if you don’t trust Facebook.']"
55,"The lines between beer, soda and spirits are blurring as beverage companies seek sales growth",2021-12-28T12:00:01+0000,"['Bud Light is adding cola and orange soda to its seltzer, Mountain Dew is moving into the alcohol aisles and Molson Coors has a whiskey brand.', 'In the hunt for growth, beverage companies are experimenting in new categories, blurring the lines between beer, soft drinks and spirits to become powerhouses fighting for consumers’ so-called “share of throat.” But some alcohol companies worry about the potential implications of such a change on the three-tier system, which has kept that industry alive — and legal — for 88 years.', 'In 2020, total beverage alcohol consumption rose 2% — the biggest gain for the industry in nearly two decades, according to IWSR Drinks Market Analysis. Beer was the only category to see declining volume, true to a yearslong trend. Consumers reached for hard seltzer cans or mixed their own cocktails while stuck at home during lockdowns and maintained those habits this year.', '“There are premium dollars going into ready-to-drink canned products in a cooler, and there’s growth again,” said Barclays analyst Lauren Lieberman at Beverage Digest’s “Future Smarts” virtual conference in early December.', 'In response, drink companies are teaming up to benefit from each other’s expertise. For example, Beam Suntory and Boston Beer announced a partnership this summer that would take well-known brands like Truly and Sauza into new categories.', 'For their part, nonalcoholic companies are diversifying their portfolios as soda consumption shrinks and new regulated beverage markets, like CBD-infused drinks, are on the horizon.', '“We’re seeing it not just from beer competitors, we’re seeing it from nonalcoholic competitors — you’ve got Coke with Topo Chico,” said Ann Mukherjee, CEO of Pernod Ricard North America. “The lines are blurring, and consumers are the ones blurring the lines, so it’s allowing a lot more nontraditional companies to come into the space.”', 'Coca-Cola launched Topo Chico Hard Seltzer with Molson Coors Beverage in the U.S. in early 2021 as hard seltzer consumption soared. According to IWSR, U.S. hard seltzer volume surged 130% in 2020, helping the ready-to-drink category overtake spirits consumption, although growth has slowed this year. Topo Chico is the first alcoholic beverage that Coke has sold in the U.S. since the 1980s.', 'Molson Coors has said Topo Chico could become a top-three hard seltzer brand, joining White Claw and Truly at the top. The drink is closing out 2021 with a 2% share of the roughly $4.3 billion U.S. hard seltzer market, despite only being available in roughly a third of states. A nationwide launch is slated for January.', 'In its latest quarter, Molson Coors reported net sales of $2.82 billion, down 2% from the same time in 2017. In the last five years, as beer sales have lagged and the company has begun transforming its portfolio, the stock has fallen 53%. Coca-Cola, on the other hand, has seen its revenue climb 9.9% over the last five years to $10 billion in its latest quarter. The beverage giant’s stock has risen 40% in that time.', 'PepsiCo wasn’t far behind its archrival Coke. In August, it teamed up with Sam Adams brewer Boston Beer to announce Hard Mtn Dew. The flavored malt beverage will contain 5% alcohol by volume and sell on the soda’s brand equity — without the high caffeine content.  ', 'Even before its launch, the drink is controversial. The National Beer Wholesalers Association has raised alarms against the launch, slated for late February. Pepsi has given a license to Boston Beer to produce the drink and created a new company, Blue Cloud, to distribute it.', '“They’re taking an existing product that’s known as a globally recognized soft drink brand and adding alcohol, creating a whole host of challenges as it relates to the regulatory side, but also public health … we’ve never had that before,” said Craig Purser, CEO of the NBWA.', 'One important concern is that soda branding for an alcoholic beverage could result in underage drinking — accidentally or on purpose. Boston Beer said the design of Hard Mtn Dew cans will feature “adult-oriented graphics” and emphasize that the drink contains alcohol as part of its efforts to separate the alcoholic beverage from the soda. The company also said it will restrict its marketing to only target consumers 21 years of age or older.', 'But the NBWA’s main argument centers on Pepsi’s potential impact on the competitive environment and, thus, the three-tier system that has long governed the alcohol industry. After the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, the alcohol industry adopted the three-tier system, which separated manufacturers, distributors and licensed outlets. Alcohol producers are only permitted to sell their products to licensed importers, distributors and control boards, which in turn are only allowed to sell to licensed outlets — like liquor stores and restaurants.', 'The complex system is supposed to ensure a legal and competitive marketplace, while safeguarding against the possibility of a Prohibition redux. Washington is the only jurisdiction where manufacturers can sell alcohol directly to retailers.', '“Having all of these separations is good, it’s fair, and it increases the competitiveness, and it really makes it so a consumer can be targeted properly with exactly what they want to buy,” said Tyler Theile, chief operating officer and director of public policy for consulting firm Anderson Economic Group. “If these lines get blurrier, states will have to get more careful about what falls in what category and where they’re allowed to be sold.”', 'Many states don’t allow large manufacturers to distribute their own products for that reason, although Pepsi is trying to sidestep that by licensing manufacturing to Boston Beer. Unlike Coke, Pepsi owns most of its bottling operations in the U.S., meaning that it has the responsibility of bottling and distributing about three-quarters of all of its North American beverages.', 'Anheuser-Busch InBev, the largest alcohol producer in the U.S., self-distributes in some markets. Purser estimates that accounts for 6% to 8% of Anheuser-Busch’s total volume.', '“If successful, [Pepsi’s] foray into alcohol to capture a wholly new white space opportunity (while ultimately better leveraging its pre-existing and extensive network of distribution assets) could drive meaningful new sources of revenue and profit growth over the next three to five years, while challenging the near oligopolistic beer distribution networks of [AB InBev] and [Molson Coors] as a viable third alternative in beverage alcohol distribution,” wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Steve Powers in a Dec. 12 note to clients.', 'However, Pepsi is entering uncharted regulatory territory as their product lines blur. Many consumer goods companies pay retailers “slotting fees” for more shelf space or premium territory in grocery stores. For alcohol producers and distributors, paying such fees is illegal.  ', '“While PEP will contend that it does not offer ‘slotting fees’ as a rule in the US, any such perceived payments for placement on PEP’s part (whether direct or indirect), or any signs of camouflaging such payments could have significant implications (including fines and/or alcohol license suspension) for PEP and its distributors,” Powers wrote.', 'Powers also said that Pepsi has acquired a small fleet of trucks that will be dedicated to alcohol distribution, at least in the early days, although it will likely move to ship Hard Mtn Dew to retailers down the line using the same trucks that carry its other products like Gatorade and Quaker Oats.', 'Emiliano Di Vincenzo, general manager of Pepsi’s alcohol business unit, said in a statement to CNBC that Blue Cloud has filed applications and has received federal approval to operate as a beer wholesaler in several states. It will distribute alcohol products made by independent brewers, while Hard Mtn Dew will be distributed by Blue Cloud, Pepsi bottlers and independent local beer distributors, according to Di Vincenzo.', 'As Coke and Pepsi move beyond soda, some beverage giants are adding the product to their drink lines. AB InBev announced Dec. 16 that it will launch Bud Light Seltzer Hard Soda in January.', 'Traditional soda has come under fire over the last two decades from health experts who worry about obesity and diabetes. In 2020, consumption of carbonated soft drinks fell 4.7%, according to Beverage Digest’s annual report. Bud Light Seltzer’s take on soda won’t contain any sugar and comes in under 100 calories.', '“Given that a significant amount of seltzer fans also purchase soda, we believe Bud Light Hard Soda is perfect for seltzer and soda fans alike,” said Andy Goeler, vice president of marketing for Bud Light.', 'After an initial pop in sales, beer-branded hard seltzers have seen their growth lag. MKM Partners analyst Bill Kirk wrote in a note to clients that he predicts Bud Light Seltzer and Constellation Brands’ Corona Seltzer will get pulled from the market. Corona Seltzer has reformulated its recipe to rejuvenate sales, while Bud Light Seltzer has focused on introducing seasonal variety packs and new lines.', 'Brewers are also pushing beyond hard seltzer and flavored malt beverages and into spirits. The category has seen consumption climb in recent years, boosted by mezcal and whiskey, while beer has lagged.', 'Molson Coors launched Five Trail Whiskey in September, starting in Colorado and expanding to three more states. It’s another step in the company’s pivot beyond beer, which included dropping “Brewing” from the company name in favor of “Beverage.”', '“The [whiskey] category’s size and growth is hard to ignore,” said David Coors, vice president of Molson Coors’ next-generation beverages unit and great-great-grandson of original brewer Adolph Coors.', 'The whiskey uses Coors malt and Rocky Mountain water, a touch that Coors said gave the spirits brand more credibility.', '“There are always critics out there, and we’ve tried to build the product and the brand as tightly as possible to minimize the critics that have tried to come after it,” he said.', 'And while some distillers might grumble about a beer giant edging into their territory, Coors noted that the two industries have been battling for some time, with spirits companies pushing canned cocktails.', '“It’s as competitive of a landscape that I think anyone’s ever seen,” he said.', 'The alcohol industry is on edge, waiting to see whose products become consumers’ new favorites and whose disappear from shelves after failing to catch on.', '“There’s a lot of new muscle that companies need to learn if they’re going to succeed in this space, and every competitor brings a different set of competencies to the game, but ultimately it’s the consumer who’s going to decide who gets to stay and win,” Pernod Ricard’s Mukherjee said.', 'The partnerships forged to make these new drink products may dissolve at the end of this learning curve, experts say. Goldman Sachs analyst Bonnie Herzog said at the Future Smarts conference that companies are in the learning stage now, trying to understand how to market and distribute their new drinks. In the future, they may push more aggressively into those categories, or choose acquisitions over organic growth.', 'For Coke and Pepsi, the push into alcohol could help the companies’ eventual entry into a newer market with the potential for even greater growth: CBD drinks.', 'CBD, or cannabidiol, is derived from the marijuana plant and some people believe it provides therapeutic relief. It does not include THC, which is what gives cannabis users a high. The Food and Drug Administration currently forbids selling food and drinks with CBD in it, making the beverage industry’s biggest players cautious to try it in the U.S. Upstarts like Recess Sparkling Water and Empress Teas, however, haven’t been as reluctant.', 'Cannabis company Canopy Growth, which is partially owned by Corona brewer Constellation Brands, also launched a line of CBD-infused sparkling waters in the U.S. earlier this year. Meanwhile, through Rockstar Energy, Pepsi debuted a line of hemp-infused drinks in Germany earlier this year.', '“When you consider CBD beverages coming into the market, that’s going to change a lot in the next 10 to 20 years,” Anderson Economic Group’s Thiele said. “Getting themselves into the regulated beverage market with alcohol, that gives them a foot in the door to potentially continue to be in the regulated beverage market with CBD in the future.”']"

None have replied at the time of publication.', 'The Philippines was handed a victory in 2016 when an international tribunal in the Hague dismissed China’s claims in the South China Sea, which contains the world’s busiest shipping lanes. The judges ruled that specific portion of the sea claimed by both countries belonged to the Philippines alone.', 'China rejected the ruling. Duterte downplayed the ruling in hopes of gaining economic concessions from Beijing and said the Philippines is no match against China in a confrontation.', 'With just months left in Duterte’s presidential term, China’s promised infrastructure investments to the Philippines have fallen short of expectations, while tensions between Manila and Beijing are rising again in the South China Sea, according to a December report by think tank International Crisis Group.', '“Many in the Philippines are increasingly sceptical of rapprochement with China if it entails giving up claims to various disputed maritime features,” read the report.', 'The South China Sea, a resource-rich waterway, contributes around 27% of the Philippines’ total fisheries production, said Vergara in the Asia Society Policy Institute report. A group of scientists have reportedly warned that Chinese activities in the disputed waters threaten the fishing industry.', 'Meanwhile, tensions with China have hindered Philippine oil exploration efforts in the sea.', '“This has serious repercussions for the country’s ability to achieve energy security as its main source of natural gas for electricity supply — Malampaya — nears depletion,” Vergara said.', 'Some in the Duterte government have more vocally protested the presence of Chinese vessels in parts of the South China Sea that were internationally recognized as belonging to the Philippines.', 'In May, Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. directed an unusually aggressive tweet at Beijing as the two countries clashed over the South China Sea. Locsin Jr. accused China of straining its “friendship” with the Philippines.

57,What Big Oil’s solar energy projects reveal about its climate strategy,2021-08-15T13:30:01+0000,"['Oil and gas companies are working hard on their messaging in the climate change era. If it’s “code red for humanity” as the UN’s IPCC said last Monday in its latest dire climate report, it’s some sort of “code red” for the fossil fuels industry too, in terms of figuring out how to stay relevant, believable — and for the market, investable — in an era of carbon emissions reduction mandates from governments, regulators and shareholders. ', 'Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub took a stab at it earlier this year, saying fossil fuels aren’t the problem — it’s emissions. It follows that if fossil fuel companies can find ways to eliminate emissions, on a large enough scale, maybe they can convince shareholders and stakeholders that they are moving into the future in more sustainable way.', 'But there are big differences in emissions types and emissions reduction strategies. What oil and gas companies do to reduce emissions in their operations and supply chain are, in the end, a smaller part of the carbon reduction game than reducing what is known as Scope 3 emissions — for example, from the tailpipe of your car. Those Scope 3 emissions, by expert estimates, are responsible for the vast majority of carbon emissions from the energy industry.', 'Companies including ExxonMobil have begun to disclose Scope 3 emissions, but in terms of their efforts to reduce emissions, remain focused on their own operations. What oil and gas companies do to lower operational emissions, the energy used to power drilling and all the way to the trucks going to and from drilling sites, does matter. Though how much it matters is inevitably smaller in the grander scheme of carbon emissions reduction efforts. ', '“The electricity oil and gas companies use is a pretty small contributor to their carbon footprint,” said Chris Archer, head of Americas for Macquarie Capital’s Green Investment Group.', 'Occidental has been a leader in many of the new technology approaches to lowering the emissions profile of the oil and gas business. As Hollub told CNBC earlier this year, “The reality of a net-zero carbon barrel, it is possible, and we are doing things to make it possible. It’s not a goal on a sheet of paper.” ', 'Occidental is working on multiple projects related to carbon sequestration, not just for its operations, but other heavy emitters in the industrial sector. A growing but smaller part of that new technology thinking for oil and gas operations, which is expected to see more development in the future, is solar energy — solar panel arrays spreading out in places like the Permian Basin to help lower the emissions profile of oil and gas operations.', 'Occidental already has a 16 megawatt solar farm in the Permian — the first large-scale solar project to directly power oil and gas operations in Texas — and Hollub told CNBC earlier this year “we will be doing more of that. We believe it will take everything, and we will add more solar over time.” ', 'Solar isn’t a new thing for oil and gas. Chevron had a project powering operations in the Kern oil field of California as far back as 2003, and BP even got into solar panel manufacturing for decades under Sir John Browne’s “Beyond Petroleum” mission (before solar manufacturing became mostly China’s game and most everyone else went bankrupt). ', '“This isn’t a brand new journey,” said Amy Chronis, leader of Deloitte’s US Oil, Gas & Chemicals team in Houston. “But it’s still early days to see broad-based carbon reductions.”', 'Now several of the European and U.S. majors are making major investments in renewable again, including BP and Royal Dutch Shell, and all the big oil and gas companies have at least a few solar power projects, whether they developed them on their own or signed what are known as power purchase agreements with project developers, including ExxonMobil, which has added to its renewable energy portfolio in recent years. ', 'It bought 500 megawatts of wind and solar in 2018 from Danish renewable energy company Orsted, the largest renewable deal ever signed by a U.S. major. Chevron signed its own 500 MW project last summer, with the energy generation to be split between the Permian, Argentina and Kazakhstan.  ', 'A lot of the renewable energy history within solar has been more fits and starts — and lower down the priority list —than consistent application to the business. Though, the pressure is mounting.', 'Benjamin Shattuck, research director for Americas upstream oil and gas at energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie, said most of the companies he follows in the U.S. are still fairly early on in their journey to a carbon reduction model, but as environmental performance and ESG become more mainstream — he said ESG is top of agenda when he talks to oil CEOs lately —and more companies talk about net-zero targets and tie executive compensation to the goals, the situation is rapidly changing. ', '“Oxy is one of the companies helping to lead the conversation, between the Goldsmith solar plant [the 16 MW plant Hollub referenced] and longer-term carbon capture and storage, they are thinking about it from a bold standpoint, which is good to see. Everything points to it picking up and accelerating,” Shattuck said.', 'Places like the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico are well-suited to renewable energy, with lots of land and a regulatory framework favorable to project development, whether oil and gas or renewables, but the economics have to make sense. And increasingly, they do.', 'Archer says these companies can have a much bigger impact on carbon reduction through carbon capture efforts and flaring reduction than by going into renewables for the power. But the Permian Basin is one of the best places in the U.S. to cite solar, with loads of cheap flat land and really good irradiance. “Today, solar, for lots of oil and gas is the economic choice versus diesel generators,” Archer said.', 'That implies solar and wind projects being developed may have been less about a focus on carbon reduction, in his view, than being driven by the power generation being economically competitive. And Archer said given how economic solar has become in places like the Permian, if oil and gas companies were serious about it as a de-carbonization strategy, we might have seen more of it already under development. ', 'No one is suggesting solar is oil’s solution. One or two solar plants, “won’t move the needle,” Shattuck said. But larger power purchase agreements and multiple projects across companies in the sector, isn’t insignificant either, in his view. “More operations need to be powered from renewables, whether they own the projects or are taking renewable generation from the grid,” Shattuck said.', 'It’s a complex process to attempt to make oil and gas drilling operations 100% renewable, from running the drilling rigs to generators and compressors and fracking trucks to get people to and from the field. The energy being used to prepare and drill new wells is greater than for existing wells, and these operations are not stationary either, moving around the Permian from West Texas to New Mexico with electric needs variable. In other words, if you build a solar plant in one area, you can’t just easily pick it up and move it to another where more wells are being focused on. That’s why Shattuck said we may see more oil and gas companies signing power purchase agreements with project developers.', '“In some cases, that alleviates the capital risk,” he said. ', 'But all the diesel that is used today — especially the more remote a drilling site is —does represent a wide range of power replacement opportunities.', 'Because Scope 3 emissions are the vast majority of emissions and the furthest from the oil and gas companies direct control — and maybe active interest in controlling, with ExxonMobil saying that while it will track Scope 3 it is really up to society and consumers to make their own energy choices — renewable energy in the fields is in a sense, the low-hanging fruit. ', '“Electrification of the oil field is important, and solar and wind can play a role, part of a larger puzzle that has to be solved. There isn’t a single solution today, that’s the theme,” Shattuck said. “It needs to be multi-technology for them.”', 'This won’t go over well with those ready to leave the fossil fuels economy behind, because the model is in effect augmenting what oil and gas companies are doing in the oil field rather than representing any full-scale pivot. It’s the emissions are the problem —not fossil fuels — of Hollub.', 'But that low-hanging fruit gives the companies a means to test the market, see how investors and stakeholders react, and going down the road of renewables, because it’s not what they have typically done in the past, is part of the effort that will be put into winning back investors in the years ahead.', '“They need to find out what’s hitting the mark and what isn’t, and if Goldsmith [the Oxy solar project] is resonating well with investors, then maybe they do more,” Shattuck said.', 'Archer worries it is still more about issuing a press release than executing on significant change, and he is skeptical that these projects can change the image of these companies.', '“When was the last time you bought something from Oxy? It’s not like you’re swayed as a consumer,” he said. “Building a 20 MW solar farm and issuing a press release won’t earn you many points. You need a bigger strategy and goals.”', 'But while the consumer at the gas pump may not think in those carbon-neutral barrel terms today, industrial buyers already do. “We have talked to companies producing natural gas and the off taker is a utility and that utility does care about the carbon footprint, about the gas burning in a power plant,” said Kate Hardin, executive director of the Deloitte Research Center for Energy & Industrials. “So maybe it is not as direct as a person, as the end user in retail, but companies buying the oil and gas may care.”', 'And that is exactly what happened in early 2021, when Oxy shipped its first-ever carbon-neutral barrel of oil to India, and issued a press release about it. ', 'There are multiple business cases to make in the future that revolve around more of these deals, if on the margins, and that relate back to the value of more renewable energy generation in the fields. Oil and gas companies need to find new competitive advantages, and even if there is a case where the economics of a solar plant don’t work on their own, decreasing export risk could be another way to make the model productive. ', '“It will be interesting to watch that competition. It’s proof of concept work, really early on,” Shattuck said.', 'That work comes at time when the sector is focused more on capital discipline and budget cuts then spending, making it more difficult for oil and gas companies to pull the trigger on experiments with technology. One of the biggest questions for the future of the oil and gas industry is tied up in the question of how much renewable energy development it pursues — what percentage of the overall spending is earmarked for carbon emissions reduction.  ', '“I don’t think it will be an insignificant amount. If they want to continue to have access to funding and capital they will have to continue with a variety of these technologies and strategies, and we will learn more about what’s most effective,” Shattuck said.', 'The oil and gas companies early work on solar implies they are learning and getting familiar with the technology, and it will stay in the mix, but other initiatives will be more material, in Archer’s view. “Building solar is not their solution. It’s good asset management with economic benefits on their existing assets. But it’s not a rubric through which they de-carbonize. But we will see more of it,” he said. ', 'For a long time, the oil and gas industry could do no right when it came to cutting spending and running operations on a more conservative basis. But in recent years, the industry has been forced by investors to do just that. Now capital discipline is a top priority to stay in favor with investors.', 'Carbon reduction efforts, including renewable energy projects like solar, are a different mode of thinking than deciding on exploration spending, but there’s a similarity: the companies are leapfrogging each other in terms of targets and as technology gets rolled out, it will play a role in the sector players that investors decide on as the likely winners.', '“It would be surprising if the budget line item is low,” Shattuck said.', 'Especially with oil and gas executive compensation packages now much more frequently designed to only go up if carbon emissions go down.']"

They’re shipped in 40 freight containers or four jumbo jets.', 'Several chip companies have seen their stock prices soar after the coronavirus pandemic led to a global chip shortage, but ASML’s share price still has some room to grow, Hogarth told CNBC.', 'He said ASML’s market cap isn’t on the same scale as the likes of Nvidia or TSMC because it’s in Europe, where the market values high-tech firms slightly lower, and because its technology is more behind the scenes.', 'Nvidia is currently valued at $521 billion, while TSMC’s valued at $533 billion.', '“As people look for alpha when investing in this trend of semiconductors being more and more critical to global supply chains, this (ASML) feels like it’s an obvious candidate,” Hogarth said.', 'ASML’s growth will be fueled by certain nation’s desire to onshore chip making and reduce their reliance on other countries. The vast majority of the world’s chips are currently made in Asia.', '“If China is going to build the equivalent of what TSMC has today, or some of the leading American semiconductor companies, they’re going to need to buy a lot of these (EUV) machines,” Hogarth said. “So, the more countries consider this technology part of their key sovereignty, the more machines gets sold.”', 'Last month, ASML said it expects a sales boom over the next decade. It believes annual revenue will hit 24-30 billion euros ($28-$35 billion) by 2025, with gross margins up to between 54% and 56%.

In a note to investors on Sept. 29, analysts at the investment bank said “We remain highly convinced on ASML’s growth potential in the mid-term but  … we struggle to see compelling upside to the shares on a 12-month view.”', 'Hogarth said he thinks the analysts are ignoring the “geopolitical dimension” and not acknowledging how much money nations are spending on building up their sovereignty when it comes to semiconductors.', 'Last year, Benaich and Hogarth predicted that Nvidia’s acquisition of British chip designer Arm would be blocked by regulators. Shortly after they made their prediction, regulators around the world announced a series of probes into the deal, which are still ongoing.', 'This year, they’re also predicting that there will be a “wave of consolidation” in the AI semiconductor industry, with “at least one of Graphcore, Cerebras, SambaNova, Groq, or Mythic being acquired by a large technology company or major semiconductor incumbent.”', 'They also believe Alphabet’s DeepMind artificial intelligence lab will have a “major research breakthrough in physical sciences.”', 'Disclaimer: Nathan Benaich has personal holdings of ASML shares.

', 'As Brouillette leaves his post, Gulf leaders are questioning how Joe Biden will engage with the region on issues like Iran. Middle East allies still don’t know how the United States, a primary external foreign policy actor in the region, will guarantee security and stability of supply to key markets in Asia and beyond. ', 'The Middle East holds over half the world’s proven oil reserves, but exporting it through the narrow Strait of Hormuz can often prove difficult. The UAE and Saudi Arabia have long sought to find alternative routes to bypass the Strait, including through pipelines.', 'The Abu Dhabi Crude Oil Pipeline has a capacity of 1.5 million barrels per day and carries the bulk of its production to the UAE port of Fujairah on the Indian Ocean. Saudi Arabia already exports some of its oil using a 745 mile-long pipeline that runs from its key production facilities in the east to the Red Sea port city of Yanbu in the west. A major expansion of its capacity is already underway. ', 'Robin Mills, CEO of Qamar Energy told CNBC there is “no perfect solution” for exports. “Tankers can be vulnerable at certain times, so can pipelines. The point is about having options and having a diversity of routes, about having backup. And that’s really what Saudi Arabia and the UAE and tried to do with those pipelines,” he said. ', '“Pipelines can be vulnerable, but you can also protect them,” Brouillette told CNBC on Wednesday. “If we can move natural gas more easily throughout the region, shipping becomes less of a concern. If we can move crude more easily, shipping becomes less of a concern.”', 'Following the establishment of ties with Israel, the UAE is also reportedly looking to collaborate on the transportation of crude and products between the Persian Gulf and Western markets. The Eilat-Ashkelon pipeline, built by Israel and Iran in the 1960s, has a capacity of 600,000 barrels a day and runs from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean.

60,The new U.S. plan to rival China and end cornering of market in rare earth metals,2021-04-17T13:00:01+0000,"['The United States has made previous attempts to reemerge as a dominant player in a rare earths supply chain that is responsible for some of the most important materials involved in electric vehicle production, battery making, renewable energy systems and technology manufacturing. Under the Biden administration, the effort is receiving renewed focus, with massive investments planned in climate change technology and a hard line being taken on geopolitical rivalries and the national security threat posed by China.', 'In 2019, China was responsible for 80% of rare earths imports, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, although exports fell last year in part due to Covid-19.', 'President Biden’s sweeping $2 trillion infrastructure legislation seeks to remake the power and transportation markets in the U.S. and rebuild the country’s semiconductor industry. It follows Biden signing an executive order in February designed to review gaps in the domestic supply chains for rare earths, medical devices, chips and other key resources, and in March the Department of Energy announcing a $30 million initiative that will tap into researching and securing the U.S. domestic supply chain for rare earths and other important minerals in battery-making such as cobalt and lithium.', '“It’s absolutely correct there is a cornering of the market with lithium and other rare earths,” Biden climate envoy John Kerry recently said at a CNBC Evolve summit on the future of energy innovation. ', 'But efforts in the recent past to rival China in the rare earths market and rebuild a domestic industry have been stymied.', '“It’s technically possible to try and rebuild the entire supply chain because we once had it,” says Jane Nakano, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic International Studies’ Energy Security and Climate Change Program. “It’s not that we’re not experienced, it’s not that we have no idea of what the domestic supply chain may look like,” Nakano said, but she added that business, environmental and political factors may make the effort difficult to achieve, especially over a short-time frame.', 'Success is dependent on whether the U.S. can quickly scale up processing and refining after the mining of the resources, and compete on cost with a magnet-making and processing market that’s heavily dominated by China. Once extracted from mines, rare earths are shipped to separation facilities, where they are separated from other minerals. Then rare earths are individually separated into oxides, metals and finally magnets that are used in everything from missiles to wind turbines, medical devices, power tools, cellphones and motors for hybrid and electric vehicles.', 'Rare earth metals are actually more abundant than their name suggests but extracting, processing and refining are tricky for a myriad of technical and environmental reasons. These 17 elements — which are subdivided into the light rare earths and heavy rare earths subsets based on their atomic weights — exist in natural deposits globally.', 'Heavy rare earths are often harder to source. They include metals like dysprosium and terbium, which play a critical role in defense, technology and electric vehicles. Neodymium and praseodymium are some of the most sought-after light rare earth elements crucial in products such as motors, turbines and medical devices. Demand for them exploded in recent years with the growth of technology and will continue to climb amid the ongoing race to create a large electric vehicle market.  ', 'While China is dominant now, in the decades before the 1980s it was the U.S. that held a majority stake in this metals market. That changed as production growth abroad and mounting environmental pressures at home shifted production overseas and also offered cheaper labor costs. According to one 2018 report from the Department of Defense, China “strategically flooded the global market” with rare earths at cheaper prices to drive out and deter current and future competitors. ', '“If the material specification fits, and the price is a dollar better, then you go for the dollar better,” said Koray Kose, senior director of supply chain research at Gartner. ', 'The three most important materials used in magnets include neodymium, dysprosium and terbium. Terbium is one of the toughest to come by because production, extraction and magnet-making are focused on China. Trade wars and retaliatory tariffs can leave many companies sourcing these crucial materials in limbo, even if they make up just a small portion of a product.', 'Market dynamics can escalate so quickly that companies without a diversified supply chain bid aggressively, materials get scarce and prices go up, Kose said. In 2011, for example, rare earth prices shot up when China restricted exports to maintain supplies for domestic industries, which was the case again during the 2019 trade war.', 'Domestic efforts to extract rare earths are taking place in states including Wyoming, Texas and California, but the recent past provides cautionary tales, such as Molycorp, which reopened the longstanding Mountain Pass mine in California in the early 2000s, only to go bankrupt in 2015. ', 'MP Materials bought the mine and restarted production in 2017. The Las Vegas-headquartered company is vying to restore the domestic rare earths supply chain from mine to magnet, and is hedging its bets on neodymium-praseodymium, with the hope of becoming the lowest-cost producer. ', 'In recent years, the Las Vegas-headquartered company received a myriad of grants and contracts from the Department of Defense and Department of Energy to research and improve domestic capabilities. One of the company’s largest customers is Shenghe Resources, a Chinese company responsible for processing, distributing and refining, which also owns a stake in the company. The connection raised some concerns among DOE scientists, according to Reuters, but government funding has continued for a rare earths separation facility.', 'Shenghe Resources distributes the concentrate produced at Mountain Pass to refiners in Asia, “capabilities that simply do not exist at scale in the West,” according to an MP Materials spokesman.', 'The company plans to reinvest the free cash flow generated from operations into expanding MP’s U.S. capabilities, including a restoration of domestic refining capability at Mountain Pass by next year. Ultimately, the company, which went public last year through a SPAC merger, plans to “restore the full rare earth supply chain” to the U.S., the spokesman said, including refining and separation, and magnet-making by 2025, as the domestic electric vehicle market ramps up production.', '“This is happening and I think it’s happening much much faster than I think anybody had anticipated,” said Ryan Corbett, the company’s chief financial officer. “We can compete and we’re going to continue to do it.”', 'Another key player in the space is Lynas Corporation, one of the largest processors of rare earths outside China. The Australian mining company, which operates a separation facility in Malaysia, recently received $30.4 million in funding from the Pentagon to build a Texas light rare earths processing facility and earned another contract, in partnership with Blue Line Corp., also based in Texas, to build a heavy rare earths separation facility.', 'A Lynas spokeswoman referred to the new facilities in an email to CNBC as an “essential foundation” for renewing downstream metal making and implementing magnet manufacturing into the U.S. She wrote that diversifying outside the Chinese magnetic materials supply chain is important to create competitive markets and meet the growing demand for 21st-century technologies.', 'While companies like Lynas and MP Materials are eager to ramp up the domestic supply chains, extracting rare earths is a difficult process due to a combination of environmental, technical and political factors. Many regions, including the European Union, have an abundance of these resources but lack the expertise that other countries like China have in the processing and magnet production, Nakano said. ', 'The rare earths industry has come under fire for environmental concerns. Many rare earth elements reside among mineral deposits with radioactive materials that can leach into the water table. Mining, processing and disposal can also contribute to ecosystem disruption and release hazardous byproducts into the atmosphere. ', 'Although the U.S. is making strides to advance the rare earths supply chain and develop alternatives to mining rare earths, environmental regulations are often more stringent than inside China. In recent years, Lynas came under scrutiny from activists and the Malaysian government for radioactive waste that it produces as part of its enrichment process. Lynas has said that the low-levels of radioactive waste were not dangerous and the Malaysian government ultimately renewed the license and green-lighted a construction plan for a permanent disposal and waste treatment facility in August 2020.', 'Some companies have proposed extracting rare earths from coal, while others suggest setting up a system for recycling old batteries or disk drives. Suggestions include calls to utilize shipping services like Amazon or USPS to set up a recycling system, but these endeavors can be costly, Nakano says. Recycling of key raw materials used in the EV space is receiving greater investment focus. Some emerging battery recycling leaders include Redwood Materials, a start-up from former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, and Li-Cycle, which recently announced plans to go public through a SPAC-merger.', 'The Ames Laboratory in Iowa is one of the many Department of Energy’s national laboratories working on projects aimed at substituting rare earths or finding new, more eco-friendly methods to recover them. One initiative by researcher Ikenna Nlebedim is a rare-earth magnet recycling process designed to recover rare earth oxides, without the hazardous acids or fumes associated. Scientists are also using the process to recover byproducts like copper and nickel. Another laboratory in Idaho is looking at how potato wastewater can be used as a cheap food source for a bacterium that can assist in recycling rare earths.', '“We already have the magnets here,” says Tom Lograsso, director of DOE’s Critical Materials Institute at Ames. “Why can’t we just retain that and close the circle domestically rather than throwing them in a landfill.”', 'In a recent interview with CNBC following the UAE’s Regional Climate Dialogue, Kerry addressed the president’s $2 trillion infrastructure proposal in relation to rivalry with China. The legislation includes $35 billion for climate research and innovation, $46 billion in renewable energy manufacturing and $174 billion to boost the electric vehicle market. China, which accounts for roughly 30% of carbon dioxide emissions globally, claims it plans to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2060 and outspent the U.S. roughly 2-to-1 on energy transition-related investments in the last decade, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance data. ', '“I think that this is a huge economic opportunity, not just for the United States, with people all around the world,” Kerry said. “This is not about China, this is not a counter to China. This is about China, the United States, India, Russia, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Australia, a bunch of countries that are emitting a pretty sizable amount, the United States and China the most.”  ', 'On April 17, Kerry and his Chinese government counterpart issued a joint statement on climate change cooperation.', 'While the U.S. aims for raw materials self-sufficiency, any drastic move away from China and other Asia-based supply chains would dramatically affect American consumers as domestic demand for batteries and electric vehicles ramps up. The pace of demand growth is expected to rise rapidly over the next few years as sales of electric vehicles are slated to reach 12.2 million in 2025, according to data from IHS Markit.', 'Building a strong U.S. supply chain can increase competition in the market, and the market is becoming more focused on the price impacts of rising demand for EVs across raw materials, which could drive up battery prices by 18% and more than double the cost of commodities like cobalt and lithium, Goldman Sachs analysts noted last month. ', 'To meet rare earths demand without global supply chains, though, would require the U.S. to reach “massive levels of production,” and build out an extraction and production chain that could take up to a decade, Nakano said. The best course, for now, is to work with allies, such as the European Union, to reduce reliance on dominant players like China.', '“Once you achieve that, let’s say ten, twenty years from now, then everyone can start looking at making a truly domestic supply chain,” she said.', '— CNBC’s Natasha Turak contributed to this report.']"

62,"U.S. can get to 100% clean energy with wind, water, solar and zero nuclear, Stanford professor says",2021-12-21T23:00:40+0000,"['A prominent Stanford University professor has outlined a roadmap for the United States to meet its total energy needs using 100% wind, water and solar by 2050.', 'Mark Jacobson, a Stanford professor of civil and environmental engineering and the director of its Atmosphere/Energy Program, has been promoting the idea of all renewable energy as the best way forward for more than a decade. His latest calculations toward this ambitious goal were recently published in the scientific journal Renewable Energy.', 'Transitioning to a clean-energy grid should happen by 2035, the study advises, with at least 80% of that adjustment completed by 2030. For the purposes of Jacobson’s study, his team factored in presumed population growth and efficiency improvements in energy to envision what that would look like in 2050.', 'Jacobson first published a roadmap of renewable energy for all 50 states in 2015.', 'This recent update of that 2015 work has a couple of notable improvements.', 'First, Jacobson and his colleagues had access to more granular data for how much heat will be needed in buildings in every state for the coming two years in 30-second increments. “Before we didn’t have that type of data available,” Jacobson told CNBC.', 'Also, the updated data makes use of battery storage while the first set of calculations he did relied on adding turbines to hydropower plants to meet peak demand, an assumption that turned out to be impractical and without political support for that technology, Jacobson said.', 'In the analysis, Jacobson and his team used battery-storage technology to compensate for the inherent intermittency of solar and wind power generation — those times when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow.', 'The Achilles’ heel of a completely renewable grid, many argue, is that it is not stable enough to be reliable. Blackouts have become a particular concern, notably in Texas this year and during the summer of 2020 in California.', 'That’s where four-hour batteries come in as a way to generate grid stability. “I discovered this all just because I have batteries in my own home,” Jacobson told CNBC. “And I figured, oh, my God, this is so basic. So obvious. I can’t believe nobody has figured this out.”', 'Jacobson said that he observed his batteries stayed charged if they weren’t plugged in when they are off.', 'To get more than four hours of charge, multiple four-hour batteries can be stacked to discharge sequentially. If a battery needs more charge output at one time than the battery can provide, then the batteries need to be used simultaneously, Jacobson told CNBC.', 'With this observation, Jacobson and his colleagues at Stanford produced scenarios showing it is possible to transition to a fully renewable system without any blackouts or batteries with ultra-long-duration battery technology.', 'That’s key because technology for ultra-long-duration batteries that would hold energy for several days have yet to be commercialized. Start-ups like Form Energy are working to bring such batteries to market.', 'Planning, of course, is also key to keeping the grid stable. “Wind is variable, solar is variable,” Jacobson said. “But it turns out, first of all, when you interconnect wind and solar over large areas, which is currently done, you smooth out the supply quite a bit. So it’s because, you know, when the wind is not blowing in one place, it’s usually blowing somewhere else. So over a large region, you have a smoother supply of energy.”', 'Similarly, wind and solar power are complimentary. And hydropower “is perfect backup, because you can turn it on and off instantaneously,” he said.', 'Also, there needs to be changes in pricing structures to motivate customers to do high energy demand activities at off-peak times.', '“Demand response is a very big component of keeping the grid stable,” Jacobson said. “It’s used some today. But a lot of places a lot of states in the US right now, the electricity price is constant all day ... and that’s a problem.”', 'So far, Jacobson and his team have run simulations for the all renewable, four-hour battery roadmaps for six individual states – Alaska, Hawaii, California, Texas, New York and Florida, and the contiguous 48 states taken together. (For the rest of the states, Jacobson has approximate simulations, which are available here.)', 'According to his models, California’s energy mix would include 14.72% on-shore wind energy, 18.28% off-shore wind, 21.86% solar panels on roofs, 34.66% solar panels operated by a utility, 5.32% hydropower, 2.91% geothermal electricity and 0.25% wave energy.', 'Texas would be 37.66 on-shore wind, 14.77% off-shore wind, 20.87% roof solar, 23.85% solar panels operated by a utility, 0.1% hydropower and 0.19% wave energy.', 'Jacobson and his colleagues use three types of models for the calculations.', 'First, they use a spreadsheet model to project business-as-usual energy demand in each sector in each state to 2050 and then to convert the business-as-usual energy demand in 2050 to electricity provided by wind, water and solar.', 'Second, they use a weather model to predict the wind and solar fields in each state every 30 seconds. This weather-prediction model runs on a supercomputer and is written in Fortran computing language.', 'And the third component of his modeling matches the 2050 energy demand with the weather modeling of energy that can be supplied from wind, water and solar every 30 seconds. The third component is also written in Fortran, but this portion of the process can run on virtually any computer.', 'The resulting models use no fossil fuels, carbon capture, direct air capture, bioenergy, blue hydrogen or nuclear power.', 'And in that, Jacobson’s roadmaps are different from many clean-energy proposals, which advocate for using all technologies possible.', '“So we’re trying to eliminate air pollution and global warming, and provide energy security. So those are the three purposes of our studies,” Jacobson told CNBC. And that “is a little different than a lot of studies that only focus on greenhouse gases. So we’re trying to eliminate air pollution as well, and also provides energy security.”', 'Addressing all three issues has been Jacobson’s focus for more than a decade. His first major work in the area was published in 2009 in Scientific American magazine, and four years later he appeared on NBC’s “Late Night with David Letterman” to promote his renewable-only approach. Jacobson and longtime progressive political candidate Bernie Sanders co-authored a clean-energy op-ed in The Guardian in 2017.', 'Jacobson knows that his viewpoint is not the loudest. The promise of next-generation nuclear power plants, for example, has gotten government and private funding of late.', 'Nuclear innovation is “pushed mostly by the industry people, people like Bill Gates, who has a huge investment in small modular reactors,” Jacobson said. “He has a financial interest. And he wants to be known as somebody who tries to help solve the problem.”', 'Gates addressed the criticism that he’s a “technocrat” looking to solve climate change with new innovations, instead of with political legislation supporting technology like wind and solar which already exists, in an interview with Anderson Cooper on CBS’ “60 Minutes” earlier in the year. “I wish all this funding of these companies wasn’t necessary at all. Without innovation, we will not solve climate change. We won’t even come close,” Gates said.', 'Also, the timeline for getting some of these technologies to commercialization is too long to be useful. Gates’ advanced reactor company, TerraPower, announced in November that it has chosen the frontier-era coal town Kemmerer, Wyoming, as the preferred location for its first demonstration reactor, which it aims to build by 2028.', '“Even if it’s seven years, that’s just a demonstration plant,” Jacobson said. “That’s not even close to a commercial plant and on the scale we need.”', 'TerraPower CEO Chris Levesque said the technology, specifically the Natrium nuclear reactor, will make a meaningful difference in combating climate change.', '“The Natrium technology was chosen as the first mover of TerraPower’s technologies because we believe it will be operational in time to offer significant benefit toward the country’s decarbonization goals,” Levesque said in a statement.', 'Winning over clean-energy skeptics afraid of blackouts is a challenge, but Jacobson believes he can convince people to accept that a future like he has modeled is possible.', 'Renewable solutions for long-distance ships and aircraft are not available yet, he said. “But those are on the drawing board. And we know technically it can be done just as those haven’t been commercialized.”', 'Education is a key hurdle, as Jacobson sees it. “I am optimistic. But the thing I find that’s the biggest difficulty is the fact that it is an information issue, because most people are not aware, most people are not aware of what’s possible,” he said.']"

It won’t have the feature that its rival, Amazon Prime, touts: free shipping for every item.', 'Walmart+ members will get unlimited free delivery, discounts of as much as 5 cents a gallon for fuel and access to a Scan & Go app that allows shoppers to skip the checkout line. But they will still have to meet a $35 minimum for each online order to avoid shipping fees, or to qualify for grocery delivery to their door. It will cost $98 a year, or $12.95 a month.', 'Amazon Prime costs $119 a year, or $12.99 a month, and includes free two-day shipping and some same-day shipping, without a minimum. Grocery delivery through Amazon Fresh is free, if customers meet a $35 minimum and are in eligible areas.

', 'She said the program is not an answer to Amazon Prime or any other competitor.', '“We’re not launching Walmart+ with the intent to compete with anything else,” she said. “We’re launching it to meet the needs of our customers, and it really was designed to make their busy lives easier. We think that it offers a comprehensive suite of in-store and online benefits that help people save time and money across a variety of areas.”', 'Walmart is the largest grocer in the country. During the coronavirus pandemic, its sales have surged as customers have bought everything from milk and toilet paper to board games and bikes in its stores and on its website. Its e-commerce sales nearly doubled in the second quarter as customers sought out safe and easy ways to shop, such as shipping packages to their homes or retrieving purchases through curbside pickup.', 'How sustainable this growth will be remains to be seen. Walmart hasn’t provided a financial outlook for the rest of the year. Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs told CNBC that some of the gains came from stimulus spending as customers had extra money in their pocket from the government — something that may or may not happen again.', 'On the earnings conference call, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon acknowledged the buzz around company’s soon-to-debut membership program. He and Marc Lore, who leads the company’s U.S. e-commerce division, were absent from a call with reporters to announce Walmart+’s rollout.', 'The company is juggling another significant business decision. It has teamed up with Microsoft to try to buy the U.S. operations of TikTok from Beijing-based ByteDance. The company has chosen a bidder and could announce a deal as soon as Tuesday, according to people familiar with the situation. ', 'Walmart+ members will get unlimited grocery deliveries to the home without a fee, so long as they spend at least $35. Other customers must pay $7.95 or $9.95 for each delivery, depending on the popularity of the time slot.', 'Walmart tested the concept with Delivery Unlimited, a flat-rate grocery delivery subscription service that cost the same amount. Subscribers of that program will automatically become Walmart+ members.', 'For curbside pickup and online packages, however, Walmart+ members and the rest of the retailer’s customers will have a similar experience. Fees and the speed of deliveries will look no different. Walmart+ members will not get preferential time slots for deliveries, Whiteside said.', 'Although Whiteside hinted at more perks in the future, she said the service’s benefits cut across its website and its stores to “make a really compelling offer.”', 'Walmart will now have to sell customers on the value of the service. It has launched and promoted similar programs and flashy initiatives before, only to pull the plug later. It launched, then scrapped its ShippingPass program, a two-day free shipping service that cost $49 a year. It debuted a text message concierge service Jetblack in New York City, but then shut it down earlier this year. It rolled out Scan & Go, a mobile app that it’s relaunching as part of Walmart+, at Walmart stores about two years ago only to end it a few months later. (The service is still available at subsidiary, Sam’s Club, where it originated.)', 'Still, Whiteside said Walmart has benefited from those programs.', '“The reality is, we tested those, we learned a lot from them, and we’ve applied all of the learnings that we got from all of those programs and others to Walmart+ to make sure we bring a program to market that we believe meets the needs of our customers, that we can stand behind and that we know is robust enough and has the capacity to scale and be here for the long term,” she said.']"

For many smaller states in the Indo-Pacific, the current choice is between either pursuing China or nothing, he explained.', 'Beijing has an ambitious Belt and Road initiative designed to expand on China’s global influence by building out rail and maritime trade routes connecting the country with central Asia, Europe and Africa.', 'For its part, China thinks the Quad alliance is “doomed to fail.”', '“A closed, exclusive clique targeting other countries runs counter to the trend of the times and the aspirations of regional countries,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said in a press briefing Friday before the Quad leaders met.', '“It will find no support and is doomed to fail,” he added.', 'The Quad announced a number of new initiatives on Friday, and vowed to step up to existing commitments.', 'They include:', 'Covid-19 vaccinesU.S., India, Japan and Australia pledged to donate more than 1.2 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines globally — that’s in addition to the shots the four countries already financed through the international vaccine access facility for low-income countries, known as Covax.

71,Niche online brands are surging as stay-at-home orders lead to spike in e-commerce sales,2020-05-24T14:35:50+0000,"['Consumers have spent the past couple decades shifting their spending habits to the internet. Now, with local stores closed and millions of people social distancing, the web has become — by default — the place we shop.', 'In a tweet last week that went viral, industry newsletter 2PM posted the words, “10 years vs. 8 weeks,” followed by a chart showing that e-commerce penetration climbed to 27% from 16% in just eight weeks of quarantine. That was the same amount of market share growth it achieved over the prior decade.', 'Amazon, unsurprisingly, has been the biggest single beneficiary, focusing on essential household and medical items. Beyond the e-retailing giant, consumers have flocked to the websites of Walmart, Target and Best Buy, which all saw surging online sales in the first quarter at the expense of physical retail. ', 'But there’s a wide swath of smaller sites and niche brands that were built for the internet shopper and are now seeing spikes in their business that they never could have anticipated. One of the leading categories is wine and spirits, which saw a 74% increase in online sales from March 11 through April 21, according to a report earlier this month from Adobe.', 'Empathy Wines, a web-based vintner that ships three, six or 12 bottles at a time and sells subscriptions that include three shipments a year, is reaching daily sales levels now that it normally sees only on Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The company, co-founded two years ago by media entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk, has been able to dial up its digital marketing efforts to reach people who are no longer going to liquor stores.', 'In addition to reasonable prices — bottles sell for $20 — Empathy’s wines can only be purchased online, so for many wine drinkers it’s an entirely new brand. The company’s small marketing team is largely based in New York, but the product is made by a winemaker in California, where all the grapes are sourced.', '“If there was a silver lining to an otherwise terrible situation, it’s that people are, in some cases for the first time ever, shopping for categories in a new way,” said Jonathan Troutman, co-founder and CEO of Empathy. “We built this business with the idea that consumers were increasingly building toward that behavior.”', 'Venture capitalist Kirsten Green is seeing that dynamic play out across her portfolio. Her firm, Forerunner Ventures, is an early investor in eyeglass company Warby Parker, skincare brand Glossier, telehealth company Hims and pet food company The Farmer’s Dog. ', 'Green said these internet-based brands were created to take advantage of the efficiencies of selling online and the preference among a large segment of consumers to avoid malls and high-traffic shopping areas. Additionally, they’re attracting new customers now because people aren’t spending on travel, concerts and plays or expensive meals, nor are they hiring babysitters so they can hit the town.', 'With consumers stuck at home, “it’s not that surprising that they would be spending on personal care, wellness for yourself, fitness and your home,” said Green. “There’s less competition for your dollars because you’re not going on vacation this summer.”', 'That’s not to say that all e-retail is benefiting. Luggage company Away (which is also part of Green’s portfolio) saw sales plunge 90% in the first few weeks after initial stay-in-place orders and furloughed or laid off over half its staff. The company’s founders said in a blog post at the time that, “it is nearly impossible to continue our mission of transforming travel when travel has come to a halt.”', 'Clothing and shoes sales are also way down. Apparel prices suffered their biggest April price drop in over five years, according to Adobe. ', '“It’s not a rising tide lifts all boats” market, said Scott Galit, CEO of money transfer company Payoneer. “We’re seeing more winners and losers at this point,” and the environment “has tended to favor larger more sophisticated sellers,” he added. Payoneer’s data points to growth in categories like electronics, toys, home essentials and home decor, and declines in apparel and cosmetics, other than skin care. ', 'Galit said some of these trends are more permanent than others. While the convenience of buying groceries and hygiene-related products online will long outlast the pandemic, categories like toys “will likely flatten out over time, both as consumers have stocked up on what they feel they need, and as the rise in unemployment and falling markets begin to limit discretionary spending,” he said.', 'Even for some digital-first brands, there have been some challenges. Warby Parker, Glossier and hair care provider Madison Reed have all had to close physical stores. But they’ve been able to make up for those losses through their online operations.', 'From February to April, traffic to Madison Reed’s website quadrupled and the number of people buying something every day climbed 13-fold, the company said. CEO Amy Errett told CNBC that even though women have been home, they’re still working and spending a lot of time on video calls so they want to look good. She also called it “an emotional experience.”', '″Throughout the period of shelter in place, we consistently saw women skipping their makeup routines, but holding on to hair color,” Errett said, in an email. “It became their one thing. For us, there was a realization that, in an incredibly difficult time, we were able to spread a little joy with a hair color kit.” ', ' The company still has plans to open eight new stores between July 1 and July 15. ', 'LensDirect is experiencing so much growth that CEO Ryan Alovis says he’s considering raising outside funding for the first time since he acquired the business in 2009. Revenue this year at the company, which sells contact lenses, eyeglasses and lens replacements, has already almost surpassed 2018 and 2019 combined, with new customer growth this month up 400% from a year earlier, Alovis said.', 'LensDirect has a contact lens subscription service, so that every three months, new lenses show up at a customer’s door. Between the ease of signing up, the free shipping and the ability to save money, Alovis doesn’t expect customers who start using the service because of Covid-19 to go back to the old way of buying eyewear.', '“It’s set it and forget it,” said Alovis, who owns LensDirect through his holding company The Stella Group. “You don’t need to drive 15 minutes and talk to your eye doctor. You go online and have them shipped for free in 24 hours.” ', 'WATCH: Amazon shares trade near its all-time high as e-commerce booms during Covid-19 lockdowns']"
