0,Target thinks it can keep growing sales — here’s how the retailer plans to do it,2022-03-01T22:16:10+0000,"['Inflation is soaring. The war in Ukraine is roiling equities and energy markets. And as Covid cases wane, people are spending more on commuting and dining out. ', 'But Target, which has been a big beneficiary of the pandemic economy, believes it can build on its already strong sales growth.', 'Target has become a $100 billion company during the global health crisis. The pandemic has highlighted investments the company made over the past several years, from sprucing up the look of stores to turning them into fulfillment hubs for online orders.', 'On Tuesday, Target argued that it can keep driving growth. It also shared a rosy forecast for the coming year: Revenue growth for the coming year in the low to mid single digits and projected adjusted earnings per share to rise by high single digits. That outlook surpassed analysts’ expectations, according to Refinitiv.', 'Here are five strategies the company plans to use as it works to live up to its projections:', 'Sipping a Starbucks coffee. Sampling lotion and lip gloss at Ulta Beauty. Trying out a new Apple device. A trip to Target stores can feel a lot like a trip to the mall — and that’s by design.', 'The retailer plans to add more shops and displays featuring popular national brands as it refreshes many of its roughly 1,900 U.S. stores. Target sees the destinations — such as Disney and Levi Strauss shops — as a way to draw customers and keep them coming back.', 'It has remodeled more than half of its stores and plans to remodel about 200 more this year, Chief Operating Officer John Mulligan said Tuesday. He said it plans to keep up that pace in the years ahead.', 'One of its major partnerships is with Ulta Beauty. It opened the first curated beauty shop inside of its stores in August and plans to add more than 250 new locations this year — to ultimately reach at least 800 total, said Target Chief Growth Officer Christina Hennington.', 'She said stores that include one of the mini Ulta shops have gotten a midteens lift in sales across total beauty and have higher rates of sales in complementary categories, too.', 'Hennington shared another way that stores will soon resemble malls: They’ll offer ear piercings. About 200 locations already pierce ears through a partnership with piercing company, Rowan, and more are coming soon, she said.', 'Shoppers may have tried curbside pickup as a way to avoid strangers and lower risk of getting Covid. Now, Target sees the popular option as a way to differentiate from competitors and encourage customers to buy more, from a hot coffee to a bottle of wine.', 'Target’s digital business has nearly tripled in the last two years. More than half of the company’s online sales come from its same-day services — which include Drive Up, its curbside pickup option; Order Pickup, its in-store retrieval of online purchases; and Shipt, its home delivery service.', 'The company is trying to give customers more reasons to use curbside pickup. Starting in the fall, select stores will allow customers to make returns or pick up a Starbucks order without unbuckling their seatbelt. About 80% of stores now offer adult beverages, such as beer and wine, through curbside pickup. Target has also added tech-based features, such as letting a shopper designate a family member or friend to pick up an order or select preferred substitutions if an item is out of stock.', '“We’re leaning into the love our guests have for our digitally led same-day services because that’s sticking,” Cara Sylvester, chief marketing and digital officer, said at Tuesday’s investor day. “Routines developed early in the pandemic are now part of their lives, things they cannot live without.”', 'For Target, there’s a clear financial benefit, too: Customers who shop across its stores and website spend four times as much as those who only shop at stores.', 'Along with selling bananas and workout clothes, Target is selling more advertisements.', 'Its media company, Roundel, launched in 2007 with five employees. It’s grown to more than 500 employees and a more than $1 billion business, Sylvester said. She said the company expects that to double to $2 billion in the next few years.', 'For instance, she said, Clorox hired the media company to measure customer behaviors and ran a test to see which customer resonated with customers. It saw a 40% higher return on ad spend and a 25% increase in customer retention during an ad campaign.', 'She called it a “win-win-win” as Target taps a new revenue stream, clients see a bounce in sales and shoppers get more relevant, personalized offers when they browse the company’s website or app.', 'It’s the same playbook of some retail rivals, including Kroger and Walmart, that are looking beyond retail for other streams of revenue.', 'Nearly a third of Target’s total sales last year came from brands it created and sells exclusively. Those range from its pet food brand Kindfull to its activewear brand All in Motion.', 'Those private brands, which tend to have a lower price point for customers and a higher profit margin for the company, could give Target a leg up with value-conscious customers — especially as households are mindful of inflation.', 'One of the areas it’s bulked up on in private label is grocery, a heavily shopped category and one where prices have noticeably gone up in the U.S. Food costs are up 7% over the past year, according to the Labor Department. Its primary food and beverage brand, Good & Gather, launched in 2019 and has grown to more than $2 billion in annual sales.', 'Chief Financial Officer Michael Fiddelke said having affordable prices has long been a focus for Target — but will become even more important in an inflationary environment.', 'Cornell said Target could benefit in another way if customers watch their budget. If gas prices go up, he said shoppers may consolidate trips and buy more merchandise at stores such as Target, which carry a wide range of items in one place.', 'Target wants speed to be another reason that shoppers choose to buy from its website.', 'It’s opening up more special facilities called sortation centers that make it possible to get purchases to customers in about a day.', 'Last year, it opened the first sortation center near its headquarters in the Minneapolis area. Nearly all of Target’s online orders are fulfilled in the back of its stores. The special facilities help clear out those packages, sort by zip code and take them to customers’ doors more quickly.', 'By the end of April, Target said it will have six sortation centers.', 'Mulligan said in the past, packages would crowd the back of stores and linger for hours as Target waited for carrier partners like UPS and FedEx to pick them up for delivery. Now, he said, Target can sweep the back of the store three or four times per day, freeing up space for employees to keep picking and packing and moving the purchase closer to its destination.', 'In the Twin Cities, for example, he said 70% of the packages delivered over the holidays came from Minneapolis stores. He said at the sortation center nearby, the company created dense, cost-efficient routes and eliminated the need for packages to make more stops in the shipping journey.', 'For packages heading further away to Ohio or to Texas, the carrier partners continue to help Target, he said. For local packages, however, Target also uses contractors who work for Shipt.', 'The end result is also lower costs for Target, too. He said average fulfillment costs dropped by over a third.']"

However, Biden’s approval increased among independents (33% in Q4, 42% now), which is in contrast to other recent public polling of Americans who don’t affiliate with either major party.', 'Along racial and ethnic lines, Biden’s approval rating is lowest among white business owners (NET -42), but he still gets high marks from Black small business owners (NET +22).', 'Biden’s overall approval from small business owners matches the 33% of owners who describe current business conditions as good.', 'The survey was conducted among over 2,000 small business owners across the U.S. before the outbreak of war in Ukraine. The war will be a dominant theme in the speech, but with oil prices hitting a seven-year high on Tuesday and wheat prices surging to a level not seen since 2008 as a result of the conflict, Biden will also be pressed to address the inflationary pressures that were already sweeping through the small business sector and impacting business decisions and confidence on Main Street.', 'The White House has been signaling that in addition to a focus on Russia and Ukraine, President Biden will use the speech to make his case for a strong economy, while acknowledging inflation.', '“As CNBC and NFIB surveys show, small business owners continue to struggle with economic headwinds including workforce shortages, rising inflation, and supply chain disruptions with little relief in sight,” said Kevin Kuhlman, director of government relations at NFIB. “Early materials and messaging appear that President Biden will acknowledge the challenges of inflation,” he said, but he added that NFIB remains worried about policy proposals including paid family and medical leave mandates and federal minimum wage hikes, which could further pressure small businesses, and continued focus on union-friendly legislation.', 'The White House highlighted paid leave mandates, a higher minimum wage, as well as its support for the labor union-supported Pro Act in an outline of economic priorities on Monday.', '“Things have changed dramatically on the international front, which raises the stakes even more for the President at home,” said Karen Kerrigan, president & CEO of the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council. “At a critical time such as this, our President needs the confidence and support of the American people behind him.”', 'For the small business community, she said, this means a speech that addresses priority concerns like inflation, health care and healing the economy rather than major tax or regulatory policies that will drive costs higher or fuel inflation further for small businesses. ', '“The American people will hear a lot about how he’s going to lower their costs, how he’s going to continue to build a strong economy over the long term,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in an MSNBC interview this week.', '“We’ve seen and heard from members about squeezes in supply chains and more corporate concentration further stifling supply chains and driving up prices,” said Didier Trinh, the director of policy and political Impact for the progressive small business trade group Main Street Alliance.', 'He cited shippers as one example of an issue where Biden can reach out to small business, and the president is expected to highlight efforts to target the shipping industry. Trinh said tax fairness and a focus on large corporations remain an issue where progress is also possible to benefit small businesses.', '“Small businesses are maybe not in an emergency situation like a year ago, but they are far from fully recovered,” Trinh said.', 'He and other small business experts cited support for small business health-care costs related to the Affordable Care Act legislation and tax credits as another area for bipartisan cooperation.', 'An increasing number (47%) of small business owners are raising their prices to offset increases in the costs of supplies, and more (32%) plan to do so if inflation remains elevated, which is their expectation, according to the survey. Over 80% of small business owners expect inflation to still be a problem six months from now (55% say that is “very likely”), while just 28% of small business owners are confident in the Federal Reserve’s ability to control inflation.', 'Overall, 31% of small business owners say inflation is the biggest risk to their business now, topping supply chain disruptions (23%), Covid-19 (20%), and labor shortages (12%).', 'President Biden’s attempt to highlight a strong economy was outlined in an administration fact sheet posted ahead of the address and which emphasized that “entrepreneurship and business investment rebounded, the economy achieved its fastest job growth in American history, the fastest economic growth in nearly 40 years,” and that there was a “historic shift from the old, outdated trickle-down approach to one that centers on workers, families, and small businesses.”', 'But inflation remains the polling issue that dominates over broader economic gains.', '“Inflation is an issue no incumbent administration wants in the headlines because they get blamed for it and can’t control it, certainly not in the short term,” said Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll. “It is also a great issue for the opposition party since no one likes inflation, they don’t have to have a specific ‘cure’ for it, and they can blame the incumbents.” ', 'Jeff Jones, Gallup senior editor, said its data shows varying economic sentiment depending on the specific issue, such as jobs and the stock market, but overall views of the economy have turned more negative since inflation became a greater concern. “The job market is right up there with the best we’ve ever seen, so it is definitely a positive ... but it looks to me like inflation is overshadowing everything else,” Jones said.', '“Inflation is an effective issue for Republicans to seize upon to think ill of Biden while Democrats downplay it. But independents are quite concerned and that is a problem for Biden and for Democratic candidates,” Franklin said.', 'Although independent small business owners in the CNBC|SurveyMonkey poll were slightly more positive quarter-over-quarter on Biden (though still expressing majority disapproval), the most recent Quinnipiac poll released in mid-February found inflation topped the list of the “most urgent issues” facing the country, at 27%, and that independents were more closely aligned with Republicans on this issue. Among Republicans, 36% cited inflation, versus 13% of Democrats who cited inflation as the top concern. But among independents, inflation was also the top issue, at 32%.The Quinnipiac survey also found a majority of Americans expecting Russia to start a war.', 'The Quinnipiac polling finds that 6 in 10 Americans feel the economy is getting worse, even though the majority describe their financial condition as good or excellent. Nearly three-quarters, 72%, say increased prices on food and gas have caused them to change spending habits.', 'In its polling, more than half of independents say they disapprove of the way Biden is handling his job. His overall approval rating in the Quinnipiac survey of 35% in February was consistent with approval ratings since October, which was the first time Quinnipiac saw Biden’s approval rating dip below 40%. “It hasn’t been able to get up above since then and independents are not helping those numbers,” said Mary Snow, Quinnipiac polling analyst.', 'Similar to the CNBC survey, Biden’s approval rating on the economy in the Quinnipiac poll (33%) was the lowest it has been since he took office.', '“It is up to him to re-set his policies and political strategy by working across the aisle and to govern as a moderate like he said he would when he ran for office,” Kerrigan said.', 'To learn more and to sign up for CNBC’s Small Business Playbook event, click here.']"
2,Walmart kicks off exclusive sales event to try to win and retain Walmart+ members,2022-02-24T17:45:38+0000,"['Walmart is giving customers a new reason to sign up and stick with the subscription service Walmart+: exclusive deals on items from air fryers to exercise bikes.', 'The sales event, which kicks off Thursday, is part of the retailer’s strategy to expand the program and turn customers into more frequent shoppers and bigger spenders. Walmart+ is also seen by the company as a lever it can pull to boost its e-commerce business and better compete with Amazon as it builds on recent growth during the pandemic.', 'Walmart’s e-commerce sales in the U.S. rose 11% in the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, and soared 90% on a two-year basis. Online sales account for roughly a third of all of Walmart’s sales in the U.S., according to the company’s financial filings.', 'The big-box retailer launched Walmart+ in September 2020. The program costs $98 a year, or $12.95 on a monthly basis, and includes perks like fuel and prescription discounts, free delivery of grocery orders of $35 or more, and free shipping for online purchases.', 'Since the program’s debut, however, Walmart has shared few details about the program’s performance — including its subscriber count.', 'Market researcher Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates a subscriber count of 11.5 million as of Jan. 31, based on its quarterly consumer surveys and industry research. That’s a fraction of the size of Amazon Prime, which debuted in 2005 and counts an estimated 172 million members in the U.S., according to CIRP.', 'About one in four Walmart.com shoppers are Walmart+ members, according to CIRP’s estimates.', 'Walmart CEO Doug McMillon has declined to give financial updates on Walmart+ during earnings calls, saying only that the retailer is focused on delivering a great customer experience and adding more membership benefits.', 'Last summer, Walmart tapped Chris Cracchiolo, a veteran of American Express, to lead the membership program, and it has added automation to dozens of stores to crank up capacity for online grocery orders, one of the program’s key perks.', 'With the sales event this week, Walmart is riffing off of a strategy used by Amazon Prime — but on a smaller scale. Amazon has thrown its exclusive sales event, Prime Day, since 2015, and it has become a popular sales holiday.', 'Walmart’s sales event will last for three weeks, with a rotating mix of items that are up to 40% off. On Thursday, the company’s website highlighted deals on items such as car seats and tires, with exclusive access to buy hot products like the Sony PlayStation 5 video game console.', 'The retailer has had other special deals for Walmart+ members, including giving them early access to Black Friday deals and exclusive access to gaming consoles on Cyber Monday this past holiday season.', 'Mike Levin, a partner and co-founder of CIRP, said Walmart’s reasons for boosting the service are clear: Those who sign up for membership programs buy more.', 'In the holiday quarter, for example, the average Walmart+ member spent $79 per visit to the website, according to CIRP. They also reported shopping an average of 29 times per year on the retailer’s website.', 'The average Walmart.com customer spent about $62 per visit in the three-month period and reported online shopping an average of 18 times per year, CIRP found.', 'Plus, Levin added, similar to members of warehouse clubs like Costco and Walmart-owned Sam’s Club, subscribers are “paying for the privilege” — creating another revenue stream for companies and an incentive for customers to go to stores and websites to get their money’s worth.', '“They’re just there a lot more often,” he said. “That’s like a fantasy for retailers.”']"
3,Amazon’s $21 billion Rivian stake is a bet that innovation can help solve climate change,2021-11-13T14:02:47+0000,"['Amazon’s big bet on Rivian Automotive paid off this week when the electric vehicle start-up made an explosive debut on the public markets.', 'Rivian raised nearly $12 billion in the mammoth offering and landed a lofty valuation of more than $110 billion, higher than auto giants GM and Ford. The IPO resulted in a massive windfall for Amazon, which invested more than $1.3 billion in Rivian. Amazon’s 20% stake in the business is now worth more than $21 billion.', 'Rivian’s IPO was a huge success for Amazon financially. It’s also key to one of the company’s most challenging mandates — to cut the amount of damage it does to the environment.', 'Amazon has long been criticized for not moving fast enough to address its environmental footprint. More than 1,000 Amazon employees walked out in 2019 to urge it to do more to combat climate change, after submitting a shareholder proposal signed by thousands of employees.', 'In 2019, Amazon founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos stood on stage to unveil a sweeping plan to transform the company’s climate policies and vowed that Amazon would be carbon neutral by 2040. He also announced that Amazon was placing an order for 100,000 electric last-mile delivery vans from Rivian to be delivered by 2030. Amazon hopes to have 10,000 of them on the road as early as next year.', 'Those goals are largely at odds with Amazon’s current reality. As the nation’s largest online retailer, Amazon delivers more than 10 billion items worldwide annually using an extensive network of gas-guzzling planes, vans, trucks and ships. It’s brought more of its transportation operations in house and dotted the country with warehouses in its quest to speed up deliveries from two days to increasingly one-day and, in some cases, within hours of an order being placed.', 'Bezos has previously said that same-day or one-day deliveries can lead to decreased emissions by reducing dependence on planes, while locating warehouses closer to customers means delivery vans can make shorter trips when dropping off packages, according to The Washington Post.', 'Transportation remains the biggest source of climate pollution in the U.S., accounting for 29% of the country’s total greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.', 'Last year, as the e-commerce giant’s business got a pandemic-fueled jolt, so did its carbon emissions, which climbed 19%. Emissions per dollar of merchandise declined by 16% in 2020.', 'For Amazon to make progress on its decarbonization efforts, it’ll need to keep investing in and implementing new transportation technologies. One way it’s already doing this is through the $2 billion Climate Pledge Fund, which Amazon uses to invest in start-ups developing technology that can help advance its climate goals.', 'Amazon’s acquisition of Zoox last year for more than $1 billion in part represents another bet on electrification. Zoox has built an all-electric, fully autonomous vehicle that’s built for ride hailing.', 'The company has been testing prototypes of its self-driving vehicle in San Francisco and Foster City in California, Las Vegas and, as of last month, Seattle. The company has also set up an office in Seattle, though Zoox and Amazon still continue to operate separately.', 'In the future, both Rivian vans and Zoox’s self-driving vehicles could fit into Amazon’s sprawling logistics network, by making the process of hauling and delivering goods cheaper, faster and more environmentally friendly.', 'But running on electricity is not necessarily a necessity for Zoox, said Bilal Zuberi, a partner at Lux Capital.', '“They could have a vehicle with a combustible engine or it could also be an electric vehicle,” Zuberi said. Amazon’s primary strategy behind investing in Rivian was to “be ahead of and have a piece of” the coming wave of electric vehicles, he added.', 'It’s unclear if autonomous vehicles have a meaningful environmental impact. Proponents of the technology say self-driving cars will reduce traffic congestion and facilitate the growth of ride-sharing services, which could mean people take fewer trips in their own cars. Others have argued self-driving cars could lead to more people using automobiles to get around, generating greater pollution.', 'Amazon has made other weighty bets in autonomous vehicles. The company in 2019 invested in self-driving car start-up Aurora as part of a $530 million funding round.', 'Earlier this year, Amazon placed an order for 1,000 autonomous driving systems from self-driving truck start-up Plus and, as part of the deal, was given the option to purchase a 20% stake in Plus. It has also tested hauling goods on self-driving trucks made by Embark.', '″[Amazon] is seeing that we’re in the very early innings of a multi-decade transformation in mobility and autonomous is going to be a huge part of that, as is electric,” said Asad Hussain, senior mobility analyst at financial data company Pitchbook. “So I think Amazon is sort of hedging its bets on all of this innovation going on and making sure they’re getting the exposure where they can in areas where, maybe in the future, it will help their core businesses.”', 'Amazon has also developed its own Scout delivery robot, which is a small six-wheeled electric vehicle. And it’s increasingly adding more micro-mobility delivery options in dense, urban areas, like electric cargo delivery bikes.', 'Amazon’s interest in decarbonization isn’t limited to its transport systems on the ground.', 'In May, Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund invested in Beta Technologies, which is building an electric aircraft, as part of a $368 million funding round. Amazon has also backed start-ups developing hydrogen-powered planes and net-zero carbon diesel and jet fuels.', 'Amazon, which has a massive ocean shipping operation, last month agreed to switch to zero-carbon fuels for ocean freight by 2040.']"
4,These smart glasses offer a glimpse at the future Apple and Facebook are planning,2021-11-20T15:00:01+0000,"['I recently tried a pair of prototype smart glasses from Avegant that gave me a glimpse of a future where we may be able to watch videos, get directions, see notifications and more, all through a pair of traditional-looking shades.', 'These sorts of glasses may be the next big thing as companies like Facebook, Snap, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and others look beyond phones.', 'I’ve worn Google Glass, the Microsoft Hololens, Snap’s Spectacles and, most recently, Facebook’s Ray-Ban Stories glasses. But those all have shortcomings. They’re either too big and bulky to wear everywhere (Hololens), don’t yet display anything on the lenses (Facebook) or look silly (Spectacles, Hololens, Google Glass.)', 'Big Tech companies will need smart glasses to look normal if they’re to have any chance at success. So they’re desperately looking for a display component that is small and can be manufactured and shipped in the next year or two, Avegant CEO Edward Tang told CNBC. ', 'Avegant doesn’t make smart glasses, but it put together a prototype pair to demonstrate the capabilities of a new LED augmented-reality light engine that the company unveiled to the public this fall. And I was impressed.', 'Here’s what you need to know.', 'A lot of companies are building smart glasses, but they’re all taking different approaches. It’s sort of a mess. Here’s a quick recap:', 'Avegant thinks it has a solution that might help companies build a product regular people will want to buy.', 'Its new light engine, which is thinner than a pencil and weighs as much as a large paper clip, fits within the hinge and temple of eyeglasses where it can show high-definition visuals to the wearer. The light engine could enable some companies that don’t have huge in-house hardware engineering teams to build glasses that are as stylish and small as a pair of Ray-Bans but offer the visual capabilities dreamed up in science fiction films like “Terminator.”', 'I demoed the light engine in October when Tang handed me the prototype glasses his team built. They were thin and looked like any normal pair of glasses except that they were tethered to a smartphone by a cable. The prototype is intended to demonstrate just how small a hardware manufacturer can make a pair of glasses using Avegant’s light engine.', '“We’re getting our stuff ready to have the smallest manufacturable display for these customers,” Tang said. ', 'I put the glasses on. A translucent blue square came on at the center of my field of view, showing a display that was overlaid on top of what I was seeing in real life. Then the demo started. ', 'The glasses began to cycle through different visuals. The small translucent screen showed me the weather, a stock chart and a text message conversation. I was looking in the direction of Tang and could see him, but the visuals also appeared on top of him in crystal clarity. It was true augmented reality. ', 'The highlight of the demo was when the glasses began to play a video. It was a snippet of a soccer match from this summer’s Euro 2020 tournament. I saw the green grass, the vast crowd and the players passing the ball to one another before the forward blasted a goal into the back of the net. The game looked as good and as big as it would if I was watching at home on my living room TV or sitting with friends at a sports bar.', 'The Avegant light engine offers a 30-degree field of view and appeared like a rectangle in the middle of my line of sight.', 'I handed the pair of glasses back to Tang, who put them on and began watching the demo. I could hardly tell he was watching anything, though I noticed a subtle hint of blue light on the lens. It appeared as if he was daydreaming.', 'But there are still drawbacks. Manufacturers who use the Avegant light engine will have to determine how much battery life they want their smart glasses to have. The more battery life, the bulkier the glasses will be. Likewise, a 30-degree field of view is on a par with the first Hololens, but it’s a smaller window than Microsoft’s Hololens 2.', 'Components like Avegant’s may help some tech companies develop smart glasses people will want to wear. But it’s still early days and skeptics don’t think we’ll have normal-looking smart glasses anytime soon.', '“The long-term vision here is to get rid of your phone in your hand, and you’ll wear your phone on your face,” Kevin Irwin, chief investment officer at Knollwood Investment, said. Irwin is an investor in Avegant. ', 'Avegant isn’t yet mass-producing its light engine. It envisions a business model in which it will sell the component to companies that can build it into their smart glasses.', 'Larger companies may not even need Avegan’ts technology, explained Karl Guttag, an expert on augmented reality display devices.', '“Facebook and Apple are ground-up companies — they’ve got phenomenal, huge teams working on this stuff,” Guttag said. “They don’t need an Avegant, if you get my drift, whereas a Snap might because they’re not really in this. They’d be looking to get a component.”', 'Guttag also has his doubts about smart glasses replacing smartphones anytime in the near future, which would limit Avegant’s prospects. ', '“The expectation that these things are going to be like Ray-Bans is off the chart far away,” Guttag said. “Now something like what Avegant’s engine does could get you something that is moderately stylish. It’s going to be a little bigger and bulkier but not all the way there.”']"

Americans — including millennials, the country’s largest generation — have been buying houses and upgrading to bigger ones during the coronavirus pandemic. That has depleted the supply of available homes and inspired some to hire contractors to redo a bathroom, replace a roof or take on other similar projects.', 'Those dynamics have lifted sales for Lowe’s and competitor Home Depot.', '“When home prices go up, consumers have confidence to invest in their homes,” Lowe’s CEO Marvin Ellison said Wednesday morning on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”', 'He said repair and maintenance projects will drive spending, even as prices rise from inflation and a mortgage rate hike looms. About half of the country’s single-family homes were built before 1980, according to data from the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. ', 'Here’s what Lowe’s reported for the quarter ended Jan. 28 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:', 'In the fourth quarter, Lowe’s net income rose to $1.21 billion, or $1.78 per share, from $978 million, or $1.32 per share, a year earlier. The results were above the $1.71 expected by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.', 'Sales climbed to $21.34 billion from $20.31 billion last year and outpaced analysts’ expectations of $20.90 billion.', 'Lowe’s same-store sales in the U.S. increased 5.1% in the fourth quarter, as customers made fewer trips to the company’s website and stores but spent more when they did.', 'Ellison said in a separate interview that a year ago the mix of purchases looked different as shoppers bought cleaning products and supplies for simple do-it-yourself projects. Now, major projects are driving a larger share of purchases.', 'Transactions in the U.S. fell 4.4% in the fourth quarter compared with the year-ago period. Ellison said sales of big-ticket items that cost at least $500 grew 15.6% in the quarter. The average ticket at U.S. stores and on Lowe’s website rose 9.5% to $95.66 in the fourth quarter, partially due to inflation.', 'Sales from home professionals jumped 23% in the three-month period, too. The pros tend to be steadier and more lucrative customers.', 'Lowe’s has historically drawn about 20% to 25% of its total sales from pros compared with Home Depot, which gets about half of its sales from them. Lowe’s has been chasing pros, however, with a new loyalty program and perks like reserved parking and free air for tires at its stores.', 'Pro sales are growing for another reason, too. As the omicron variant recedes and schedules get busier again, some people are hiring contractors rather than taking on DIY projects.', 'Like other retailers, Lowe’s is seeing costs rise and chasing inventory due to supply chain delays.

It already halted production of its more expensive Bike+ in December and will do so until June. It won’t manufacture its Tread treadmill machine for six weeks, beginning next month. And it doesn’t anticipate producing any Tread+ machines in fiscal 2022, according to the documents. Peloton had previously halted Tread+ production after a safety recall last year.', 'The company said in a confidential presentation dated Jan. 10 that demand for its connected fitness equipment has faced a “significant reduction” around the world due to shoppers’ price sensitivity and amplified competitor activity.', 'Peloton has essentially guessed wrong about how many people would be buying its products, after so much demand was pulled forward during the coronavirus pandemic. It’s now left with thousands of cycles and treadmills sitting in warehouses or on cargo ships, and it needs to reset its inventory levels.', 'The planned production halt comes as close to $40 billion has been shaved off of Peloton’s market cap over the past year. Its market value hit a high of nearly $50 billion last January.', 'Peloton shares closed Thursday down 23.9% at $24.22, bringing the stock’s market value to $7.9 billion. During trading, shares hit a 52-week low of $23.25. The drop also brought the stock below $29, where it was priced ahead of Peloton’s initial public offering.', 'The company’s presentation shows Peloton had initially set expectations on Oct. 31 for demand and deliveries in its fiscal third quarter and fourth quarter that ended up being far too high. It reevaluated those forecasts on Dec. 14, according to the presentation, and Peloton’s expectations dropped significantly for its Bike, Bike+ and Tread.', 'However, Peloton said, the latest forecast doesn’t take into account any impact to demand the company might see when it begins to charge customers an extra $250 in delivery and setup fees for its Bike, and another $350 for its Tread, beginning at the end of this month.', 'Peloton also said it has seen low email capture rates for the upcoming debut of its $495 strength training product, Peloton Guide, which is codenamed “Project Tiger” in internal documents viewed by CNBC. Email capture rates keep track of the number of people who enter their email addresses on Peloton’s website to receive information on the product. The company said this is a signal of “a more challenging post-Covid demand environment.”', 'The official launch of Guide in the U.S. was pushed from last October to next month and now could come as late as April, the presentation dated earlier this month said. The company also said it initially planned to charge $595 for the bundle that includes one of Peloton’s heart rate arm bands and later dropped the price by $100.', 'Late Thursday, Chief Executive Officer John Foley said in a statement, “As we discussed last quarter, we are taking significant corrective actions to improve our profitability outlook and optimize our costs across the company. This includes gross margin improvements, moving to a more variable cost structure, and identifying reductions in our operating expenses as we build a more focused Peloton moving forward.” ', 'Foley added that Peloton will have more to share when it reports its fiscal second-quarter results on Feb. 8 after the market closes. ', 'A little more than a year ago, Peloton was facing the exact opposite issue. It had too much demand and not nearly enough supply. In December 2020, it announced a $420 million acquisition of the exercise equipment manufacturer Precor, giving it more than 625,000 square feet of production space. That deal closed early last year.', 'Then, last May, Peloton said it would be spending another $400 million to build its first factory in the United States to speed up production of its cycles and treadmills. That facility in Ohio isn’t expected to be up and running until 2023.', 'In recent months, though, gyms have reopened and consumers don’t appear to be throwing as much money into at-home fitness equipment. At the end of its latest quarter, Peloton counted 2.49 million connected fitness subscribers. It only added about 161,000 net new members in the period ended Sept. 30, its lowest growth in two years.', 'The reversal is seen in its stock price. Pelton shares rallied more than 440% in 2020, but dropped 76% in 2021.', 'In a separate internal Peloton presentation dated October 2021, which was obtained by CNBC, Peloton said that it was expecting overall fitness spending would continue to grow year over year, but instead overall spending was flat following the summer months.', 'Analysts in recent weeks have been trimming their expectations for Peloton’s second quarter as well as their price targets for the stock, projecting that Peloton had a weak holiday.', 'One bright spot the presentation noted was that Peloton’s share of the total connected fitness market had been increasing.', 'But a report from research firm M Science shows that Peloton’s overall market share might be on the decline. In November, Peloton’s share of all connected fitness products priced at a minimum of $1,400 was tracking slightly below levels observed in 2019 and 2020, M Science said. That’s despite the lift Peloton saw on key holiday shopping days including Black Friday and Cyber Monday, it said.', 'M Science pegs Peloton’s share of the market for products priced at more than $1,400 at a little more than 65%, making it the leading player. Other at-home fitness products that M Science tracks include Echelon, Hydrow, Lululemon’s Mirror, NordicTrack and Tonal.', 'M Science also said that it didn’t yet see “any evidence of another wave of at-home fitness demand as a result of recent Covid-19 developments.”', 'CNBC reported on Tuesday that Peloton is working with consulting firm McKinsey & Co. to look for ways to slash costs, which could entail job cuts and store closures. A person familiar with the matter said Peloton has already started layoffs in its sales division. The person requested anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak for the company.']"
7,Three former SpaceX engineers are designing self-powered electric freight train cars,2022-01-19T17:08:38+0000,"['Three former SpaceX engineers are launching a company to design and build electric self-powered train cars, in a bid to improve efficiency and lower emissions in the freight rail system.', 'Freight trains are a lot more energy-efficient than trucking. Thanks in part to better aerodynamics, moving one unit of freight by train takes one-quarter the energy required to move it by truck, said CEO and founder Matt Soule told CNBC.', '“But because of how rail is architected, it has its operational and economic limits,” said Soule . “But if you can break through those barriers and allow rail to serve more of these markets — that’s the opportunity.”', 'Moving the freight system from diesel to electric power could also play a major part in reducing the carbon emissions that cause global climate change. Transportation accounts for 29% of the total greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, according to a report issued by the Environmental Protection Agency in Dec. 2021. Almost a quarter of that comes from medium and heavy duty trucks.', '“We think it’s very relevant to focus on energy usage reduction,” Soule told CNBC.', 'Soule got the idea in an unusual way.', 'At SpaceX, where he started in 2006, Soule was the Head of Avionics, meaning “we made the electronics that made the rocket fly straight.” After he left in 2019, Soule was waiting to meet a friend, technologist and product designer Brian Ignaut, for coffee, and watching YouTube on his phone. The selection algorithm randomly served him a video on freight trains. That got him thinking about the potential in the freight train system and the need to reduce its carbon emissions.', 'By Thanksgiving 2019, the idea for the company was coming together, and in January 2020, Soule went on to launch the company two other SpaceX employees, John Howard and Ben Stabler. The trio kept mostly quiet about what they were doing until Wednesday, when they revealed the company to the press and announced a $50 million funding round led by Anthos Capital.', 'The company is just in the prototype stage and has no customers or revenue yet. With the new round of funding, Parallel Systems, which was running on $3.6 million in seed funding, will build a fleet of rail vehicles, execute advanced testing programs, and grow the team.', 'So far, with its staff of about 25 engineers from tech companies like Google, Tesla, and Uber, Parallel Systems has built several prototypes and tested tested its first-generation vehicle on a closed track in the Los Angeles area.', 'The vehicles works in pairs. Each pair carries one standard shipping container — the same box that goes on flatbed trucks and gets loaded in and out of ships in port cities across the globe.', 'The cars carrying the containers are each self-powered, but the system will work best if the cars are linked together. So instead of having a long freight train powered by a few diesel locomotives, Parallel Systems envisions a “platoon” of 10 to 50 self-powered freight cars, Soule told CNBC.', 'That’s a lot shorter than traditional freight trains, which can run up to 200 cars or more. Today, freight trains favor length because the more a single train can haul, the cheaper the cost becomes to move each unit full of stuff. But parking and unloading them is a big chore, Soule told CNBC.', 'A very long train requires a very big train terminal for unloading and loading freight. That can be a problem because ports and places where freight is loaded are often in urban areas, like Los Angeles, where land and space are at a premium.', 'Autonomous train platoons could improve train terminal logistics and lower those costs.', '“Since the vehicles self-position under the crane and self-clear, the terminal dwell time and required land capacity is much smaller,” explained Dean Wise, a former vice president of network strategy at BNSF Railway who advises the company.', 'Making the cars electric does not necessarily make the system totally green -- it depends on how the electricity that powers that part of the grid is created, as Soule readily admits.', 'But an electric rail car at least has the potential to emit zero greenhouse gases, while diesel trains will always emit some.', 'Moreover, because electric rail vehicles use 25% as much energy as a long-haul truck, their batteries only need 25% of the storage capacity that would be required for a long-haul electric truck. Soule said the company hasn’t yet decided what kind of batteries to use, but is looking at storage technologies from the utility space.', 'For Soule, transitioning from his previous post at SpaceX means getting used to overseeing and moving forward the whole company and getting used to being a salesman.', 'But he says it’s been encouraging seeing industry veterans react to the prototypes, Soule said.', '“No matter how many PowerPoint presentations we give them, as soon as they come see it in person, you can see the lightbulb come on,” Soule said.', 'Wise says the former SpaceX engineers have latched on to an idea that others in the industry had been imagining.', '“At BNSF, we had brainstormed that a self-powered autonomous rail vehicle would be a game-changer, dramatically improving rail’s ability to compete with the highway, and defend against the looming challenge of autonomous trucks — now acknowledged by most as a matter of when, not if,” Wise told CNBC.', 'So far, Parallel Systems has had calls with 30 “major companies” in the space, including class one railroads, shortline rail holding companies, motor carriers, ocean carriers, ports, and industrial shippers, Wise said.', '“The clincher for me was that these conversations were universally positive and uncovered additional value, refinements, and potential applications, leading to several companies seeking strategic development partnerships and investment opportunities with Parallel,” said Wise.']"

We want a blue-water navy’ — of course, also to make power,” Schonbach told CNBC’s Martin Soong on “Squawk Box Asia” on Wednesday. A blue-water navy is one that can operate globally in open oceans and is not limited to near-shore functions.', '“The question is if they fit into the international rules-based order,” he said.', 'Schonbach made his comments as the German frigate Bayern is docked in Singapore. The Bayern arrived Monday as part of a six-month deployment to Asia-Pacific. It is sailing through the South China Sea, marking the first deployment of a German warship to the Indo-Pacific in almost 20 years.', 'China’s growing naval might has become a source of increasing concern for the United States as well as democracies in Europe and Asia.', 'According to a recent report on Chinese military power, the U.S. Department of Defense said China is the world’s biggest ship-producing nation and is nearly self-sufficient in those endeavors. It also expects China’s second domestically built aircraft carrier to enter service by 2024 and projects the country to maintain between 65 and 70 submarines by the mid-2020s.', 'Washington is concerned about Beijing’s moves in the South China Sea, as are countries that bound it including Vietnam and the Philippines. The South China Sea is massive, about 1.4 million square miles (3.5 million square kilometers), and contains some of the world’s most critical shipping lanes.', 'China claims most of the South China Sea as its own territory though other countries and an international ruling from the Hague have rejected those claims.', 'During a visit to the Indo-Pacific region last week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken called on China to cease its “aggressive actions” in the region.', '“Nowhere is the rules-based maritime order under greater threat than in the South China Sea,” Blinken said in July. “The People’s Republic of China (PRC) continues to coerce and intimidate Southeast Asian coastal states, threatening freedom of navigation in this critical global throughway.”', 'Germany’s deployment of the Bayern comes after the country issued policy guidelines on the Indo-Pacific region last year, which noted that European and Indo-Pacific economies “are closely connected through global supply chains.” Berlin also said in its announcement that if there are conflicts in the region that “adversely affect security and stability there, this has repercussions for Germany, too.”', 'Schonbach said the deployment is “like a teaser” and signals German commitment to step up engagement in Asia, including through expanding its security and defense cooperation with regional partners. ', '“We’re here for the first time after 19 years to check the battlefield,” he said. “Last year, the government of Germany promulgated the guidelines for the Indo-Pacific. This is now the first step. The next step, probably, I hope that we can come on a regular basis — two or three years.”']"

', 'Three disruptions have converged at the same time – in shipping, in computer chips, and in plastics. Each of these chains are among the most important foundations of the modern economy.', ' The granular data tracked by  IHS Markit - in shipping, chemicals, automotive, and economics  - demonstrates the extent of the disruptions.', 'The great boiler room of today’s globalization is containerization. ', 'The massive container ships - about 5,400 altogether - ply the oceans, carrying to the world’s markets at any given time about 20 million containers, filled with everything from tennis shoes and anti-virus masks to laptop computers, auto parts, and  solar panels.', 'Asia is the source of much of the goods, most notably China, home to seven of the 10 largest container ports in the world. ', 'The turmoil in shipping began early in 2020 when the pandemic shut China down for two months.  That meant the evaporation of expected shipments of goods to the rest of the world.  As China recovered, North America and Europe shut down.', ' With people stuck in their homes, their spending on such services as travel plummeted, while spending on electronics, home furnishings, and many other goods shot up.  That, combined with the urgent need for medical supplies and protective gear to fight the pandemic,  meant a swelling flotilla of container ships sailing towards the United States.', 'The adjacent ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which handle half of total U.S. imports from Asia, have been overwhelmed, with no slack time to catch up on the backlog. The congestion was made worse by the restriction and distancing that Covid has placed on work schedules.', 'Huge container ships continue to be stacked up outside those ports, unable to get to berths, meaning that goods are not being landed to meet the surging demand. ', 'A Federal Maritime Commissioner described the West Coast back-ups as “the worst we’ve ever seen.”', 'The impact can be measured in trade and shipping costs. Containerized shipping to the West Coast was 30 percent higher in February 2021, over 2020, and shipping rates from Asia to the East Coast , including surcharges, are up as much as five times over last year.', 'The shipping disruption has been further aggravated by an imbalance between where the containers are and where they are needed.', 'The second major disruption is of computer chips, which is hitting the auto industry.  This is made worse by the tangle in shipping.  But the main reason is the  surge in competing demand for computer chips for electronics and 5G and automobile industry, along with the overall rapid recovery in China. ', 'Then, as things happen, a major computer chip factory in Japan caught fire.  An extended drought in Taiwan, source of 60 percent the world’s chips by value, has created another crick in the supply chains, this for the pure water necessary for chip manufacture.', 'The “chip famine” continues to play havoc with auto manufacturing.  Today’s cars are also electronic devices that run on computer chips – and increasingly so.   Owing to the shortage of chips, the major automakers in North America, Europe, and China have had to temporarily halt some production. ', 'Even though chip manufacturers have announced new investment in capacity, this will take time; IHS Markit estimates that this shortage, at least for the auto industry, will persist into next year.', 'The weather instigated the third disruption.  Texas was hit by a deep freeze for which it was not operationally prepared.  The electricity supplies necessary to keep natural gas wells flowing were cut off, shutting down the gas production required to operate the power plants in the first place.  In a vicious circle, that meant still less electricity. Texas went dark.', 'The Texas petrochemical plants, which produce a substantial part of the world’s plastics, had to rush to implement emergency shutdowns to avoid accidents or lasting damage to the facilities.  These factories are coming back into operation, but slowly and with great care, and that will take many more weeks and then additional weeks to replenish supplies.', 'The result has been a widespread shortage of plastic materials that are used to make such things as furniture, mattresses, and car seats.  Alternative supplies that might be brought in from Asia are stuck in the same Pacific maritime traffic jam. No flexible foam means further shutdowns in auto plants. With fewer car seats, fewer cars to go to dealers.', 'Then the huge Ever Given container ship got caught sideways in the Suez Canal, blocking passage in that critical shortcut that saves 6000 miles in the journeys between Asia and Europe.  This added yet another level of disruption to global supply chains – jumbling schedules and pushing congestion up to what is called “critical levels” in  European ports already struggling with overload.', 'The interconnected pressure on supply chains is increasing as the economic recovery gains pace. Manufacturing of all kinds will be hampered by shortages in the months ahead.  Port congestion will disrupt the complex flows of auto components.  Trucking , which picks up the containers at ports, is stretched to the limit in the United States.', ' “I’ve never before seen a situation where every sector of the [transportation] industry is slammed,” is the way one trucking executive put it. Meanwhile, the shortage of computer chips is impeding the manufacture of new trucks.', 'The global supply chains have been a great engine of economic growth, indeed essential to the performance of the world economy.

And there is a lack of faith in policymakers, with 71% of small business owners not confident in the Federal Reserve’s ability to control inflation.', 'The CNBC/SurveyMonkey online poll was conducted January 24-30, 2022 among a national sample of 2,227 self-identified small business owners.', '“The underlying problem with inflation is that there’s no end in sight,” said Laura Wronski, senior manager of research science at Momentive, which conducts the survey for CNBC. “We’ve become accustomed to rising and falling Covid waves, and businesses have had the time to rewrite their playbooks to accommodate. But no one knows how quickly or to what degree inflation will continue to rise, so that unpredictability is inducing some unease,” she said, with the lack of faith in the Fed adding to the uncertainty.', '“I don’t think it is getting better. It has gotten worse,” said Michelle Pusateri, owner of San Francisco-based Nana Joes Granola.', 'Nana Joes Granola witnessed a boom in business during Covid as demand for packaged goods skyrocketed, but the business situation has flipped, with the hyper-growth from earlier in the pandemic now overwhelmed by supply chain and pricing issues and its profit margins being squeezed.', 'Nana Joes Granola stocked up on ingredients and bought them at higher volumes to get lower pricing as demand outstripped supply and logistics issues worsened. The loading up on inventory is “more of a stopgap right now,” Pusateri said, but she expects it will probably become a long-term business issue. Her firm held $94,000 of inventory at the end of 2019, but by the end of last year, that had risen to $327,000.', '“I think more and more businesses will have to sit on more inventory,” Pusateri said.', 'In multiple ways, small business owners have lost leverage with suppliers. Large buyers are favored in transactions, and smaller buyers are no longer able to order in smaller batches (e.g. half-pallets) or rely on contract pricing.', '“Lots of ingredients are in high demand, meaning farmers and vendors and brokers can name their price. They can wait until the last highest bidder,” said Pusateri, who is a member of the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Voices community. Among that Main Street sample, 84% indicated in a recent survey that inflation has gotten worse for them since September, and only 13% see supply chain issues subsiding over the first half of 2022.', 'Nana Joes Granola’s main ingredient, oats, has seen a huge spike in price, and Pusateri does not expect any downward pricing pressure given the current level of supply and demand.', 'It’s not just an increase in input costs, but the magnitude of the increase which is walloping smaller companies. Eric Groves, co-founder and CEO at online small business platform Alignable, which has been tracking the impact of inflation, pointed to the percentage of businesses that indicate they are seeing the highest level of cost increases. Overall, 78% of small businesses say their costs are above pre-pandemic levels, but the largest block of small businesses (29%) say they are seeing price hikes of 25% or more for their business inputs.', 'All of the headlines about inflation will make it easier for small business owners to increase costs and not have customers react as negatively as they might expect, but while over 50% of businesses are passing along the cost increases to customers, only 9% tell Alignable they can do this at a level where it is above breakeven for them.', '“Costs have gone up more than their ability to pass it on down, and that’s what is critical to recovery,” Groves said. “That’s where the feeling of stress is coming from. It’s the squeezing of margins, not just revenue ... what’s going in their pocket,” he added.', 'It is a fraught situation for small businesses trying to figure out how much they can afford to charge without risking a decline in customer numbers and loss of recurring revenue, with many small businesses still not all the way back from Covid’s shock. Alignable’s data finds roughly 35%-37% of businesses saying that 90% or more of their customers from the pre-Covid period have returned.', 'Small business owners tend to be optimistic by nature, but Alignable’s data shows them more pessimistic now about their own recovery timelines. Last June, small business owners expected revenue to be back at pre-Covid levels midway through 2022. Now that has been pushed back by a full year to mid-2023.', 'Pusateri says inflation is beginning to eat into demand for her company’s granola, which is priced at the premium end of the product category. “People are starting to look at what they are spending on. For us, it’s more of people starting to really look at pocketbooks,” she said.', 'NFIB’s most recent quarterly survey found the percentage of small business owners having to increase prices rising to over 60%, the highest reading in the NFIB data since Q4 1974.', '“They are getting squeezed by supply chain disruptions and inflation and workforce shortages and already had to reinvent themselves a few times over in the past few years, and are running out of options,” said Kevin Kuhlmann, who leads the NFIB’s government relations team. “They are continuing to adapt ... but you can only increase prices so much before you might see a loss,” he said. ', 'Nana Joes Granola accessed a Covid economic injury disaster loan from the Small Business Administration to fund its higher level of inventory buying, but that financing program ended in 2021, and there is no indication the federal government will reinstate it. Pusateri said she is now being forced to contemplate business loans or taking on investors, a move she has not had to make previously.', '“There aren’t many policy options for issues like inflation and the supply chain,” Kuhlmann said. And even if inflation is tamed, that does not mean prices will go down. “It’s sort of a new normal,” he said. “You want to slow down price increases. It’s frustrating business owners.”', 'Small business does tend to be a lagging rather than a leading indicator for the economy, but the growing worries on Main Street are “a worrisome indication that inflation will be more persistent,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics.', '“Their pricing decisions tend to lag their bigger competitors, so if small businesses are raising prices more aggressively it could signal inflation becoming more endemic,” Zandi said. And since small businesses do not tend to think of themselves as having pricing power over the long-term, if they are “becoming more emboldened” it is an indication that inflationary pressures are broader-based, he added.', 'The CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Confidence Index score continues to hover around all-time lows, holding at 44 out of 100, which was unchanged from Q4 2021 and nearly identical to the all-time low score of 43 from a year ago. Overall, the business outlook is mixed, with 46% of Main Street businesses saying they expect revenue to increase in the next 12 months, according to the CNBC|SurveyMonkey data.', 'Politics is a factor, with only 33% of business owners saying conditions are “good,” equal to the 33% of business owners who say they support President Biden.', 'The percentage of Democrats who expressed support for Biden remains very high, at 83%, but did decline this quarter by six percentage points. Just under half (49%) of Democratic small business owners described conditions as good. A majority of Democrats expect inflation to still be a problem six months from now (67%) but that is considerably less than the 92% of Republicans who see inflation sticking around. And Democrats are much more likely to believe the Fed can control inflation, at 61%, versus 11% of Republicans surveyed.', 'Certain sectors within the small business community that are more exposed to the global supply chain are facing greater pressures, and there are positive indicators across the business landscape. As a whole, companies are doing a good job of passing through costs to customers with corporate profit margins as wide as they’ve ever been back to World War II, but the benefits of pricing power are accruing more to the largest corporations.', 'Small businesses do not typically have high cash reserve levels — according to Alignable it is on average 34 days of cash on hand — leading to a situation in which any kind of financial hit is very difficult to recover from. “So as they are trying to build back to recovery from Covid, every little bit of extra margin they can eke out is critical, and with cost increases and the inability to pass along, we will see more and more businesses struggling with that,” Groves said.', 'A key measure of business health, business-to-business payment transactions, isn’t showing any signs of stress, with even companies of 500 employees or less paying bills on time. “At least so far, they are managing,” Zandi said.', 'Small businesses sentiment, similar to consumer sentiment, tends to be reactive and based on the most recent information or anecdote rather than longer-term forecasting, which means that current gas and fuel prices, which can be major inputs for small businesses, can lead to a sharper shift in sentiment in the short-term. On Monday, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York released an inflation survey that showed the first decline among Americans’ inflation expectations in over a year, though still near a record level. ', 'But Zandi said if nothing else, the latest data from Main Street is “proof positive we have a problem.”', 'Pusateri described herself as “a lot less confident now” after having made it through Covid, and even having seen hyper-growth during the earlier part of the pandemic. “I thought getting through 2020, ‘oh my god, we did it.’ We were still profitable. And then, all of a sudden, I couldn’t find ingredients.”', 'Nana Joes Granola went from 135% profit growth during the packaged foods boom to currently operating at less than breakeven in a pricing environment hitting it from all sides. In addition to the supply issues, wage inflation and lack of leverage as a buyer, freight charges across the country have risen and the company has had to change its free shipping policy for its direct consumer business. “We’re getting steamrolled over. Everywhere I look getting price increases,” Pusateri said. ', 'The financial market and economists including Zandi expect inflation will moderate later in 2022, but if it doesn’t happen soon, he said, “the small business owners will be right.”', '“I don’t think inflation is going away any time soon,” Pusateri said. “We will be stuck in this.”', 'To learn more and to sign up for CNBC’s Small Business Playbook event, click here.']"

Launched out of “stealth” on Thursday, Worldcoin promises to hand out free cryptocurrency to people who verify their accounts by taking an iris scan.', 'Worldcoin says it’s already attracted $25 million in funding from Silicon Valley investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Coinbase and billionaire LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, giving the firm a $1 billion valuation.', 'Altman, CEO of artificial intelligence group OpenAI and former president of start-up accelerator Y Combinator, co-founded the company with theoretical physics student Alex Blania and Max Novendstern, a former investment associate at Bridgewater Associates.', 'The idea seems outlandish at first. Free money? And all I need to do is have my eyes scanned? It sounds too good to be true.', 'However, Worldcoin’s founders say it’s about expanding the reach of cryptocurrencies — and financial services more broadly — to the masses. Less than 3% of the global population are crypto users, according to virtual currency exchange Crypto.com.', '“Cryptocurrency is a very powerful thing,” Blania, Worldcoin’s CEO, told CNBC. “It will widen the boundaries of the economy in general and give many people access.”', 'Worldcoin has already shipped its orb-shaped devices to people in 12 countries. Testers get users to sign up by having their iris scanned. The image is then encrypted and becomes a unique code, while the original data is deleted to protect users’ privacy. Following that, users are given a free share of Worldcoin’s cryptocurrency.', '“We designed the whole system to be fundamentally privacy-preserving,” Blania said. “The iris code itself is the only thing leaving the orb. There’s no big database of biometric data.”', 'The company has so far amassed over 100,000 users globally already, and is onboarding 700 more each week. Worldcoin aims to hit 1 billion users by 2023.', 'Which raises a big question — how exactly is Worldcoin meant to be used?', 'Well, one early feature of the project will be a digital wallet that lets users store their crypto and make payments. But more broadly, Blania hopes to attract developers who can build apps on top of its system; apps “that we don’t see today and that are really hard to build today because very few people hold crypto.”', '“Network effects are these very coveted things that are incredibly big,” Blania said.', '“You see this in Facebook. As soon as you suddenly have a billion people and everyday people holding something like that and using something like that, you as an entrepreneur can build completely new things.”', 'One issue Worldcoin encountered early on, Blania says, is ensuring that people aren’t able to cheat the system. He calls this problem “proof of person.”', '“The only solution for that problem, we found, was to build an orb,” Worldcoin’s boss said. “It’s the most secure and privacy-preserving way we found to prove everyone in the world is unique.”', 'It’s a concept that has parallels to a universal basic income, or UBI, which has been promoted by Altman and several other high-profile figures in tech.', 'The idea is that, by handing out cash regularly to citizens for free, governments can mitigate the impacts of artificial intelligence and automation on workers.', 'Blania hinted that Worldcoin could be used as the “infrastructure” to carry out UBI at some point in the future.”', '“I’m personally very excited about UBI over the long term,” Blania said. “I think it’s a very hard thing to implement right now.”', '“We see ourselves as building this huge network of people where entrepreneurs can jump in and build applications like this. UBI is one of those, but building big financial, global companies is another big one.”', 'Worldcoin isn’t the only far-out project Altman has thrown his weight behind. In 2018, the millionaire tech entrepreneur paid $10,000 to a start-up called Nectome to have his brain preserved, scanned and uploaded into a computer simulation.', 'Worldcoin has built its system on Ethereum, the blockchain network behind the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. Blania hopes to tap into a fast-growing trend in crypto known as decentralized finance, or DeFi, which seeks to cut the middlemen out of traditional financial processes like lending and investing.', 'Worldcoin’s launch comes at a time of renewed interest in cryptocurrencies as the prices of bitcoin and other digital coins have surged lately. Bitcoin, the world’s largest virtual currency, notched a fresh record high above $66,000 on Wednesday, while ether, XRP and other tokens also climbed sharply.', 'Cryptocurrencies have gained a reputation for their involvement in fraudulent activity, with various pump-and-dump schemes duping amateur investors into buying tokens, only for the creators and insiders to make off with millions.

16,These 23-year-old Texans made $4 million last year mining bitcoin off flare gas from oil drilling,2022-02-12T15:15:01+0000,"['HOUSTON — When Brent Whitehead and Matt Lohstroh were sophomores at Texas A&M University, they decided to get into the business of mining bitcoin on the oil fields of East Texas. The year was 2019, and at the time, the idea of oil and gas companies joining forces with bitcoin miners was considered both avant-garde — and a major taboo.', 'But Whitehead, an engineer hailing from a family with a long history in oil and gas production, and Lohstroh, a finance major with a bitcoin obsession, ignored the skeptics, and sunk all the cash they had earned from their high school side gigs in lawn care and landscaping into Giga Energy Solutions, a company that mints bitcoin from stranded natural gas.', 'For years, oil and gas companies have struggled with the problem of what to do when they accidentally hit a natural gas formation while drilling for oil. Whereas oil can easily be trucked out to a remote destination, gas delivery requires a pipeline. If a drilling site is right next door to a pipeline, they chuck the gas in and take whatever cash the buyer on the other end is willing to pay that day. But if it’s 20 miles from a pipeline, drillers often burn it off, or flare it. That is why you will typically see flames rising from oil fields.', 'Beyond the environmental implications of flare gas, drillers are also, in effect, burning cash. To these two 23-year-old Aggie alums, it was a big problem with an obvious solution.', 'Giga places a shipping container full of thousands of bitcoin miners on an oil well, then diverts the natural gas into generators, which convert the gas into electricity that is then used to power the miners. The process reduces CO2-equivalent emissions by about 63% compared to continued flaring, according to research from Denver-based Crusoe Energy Systems.', '“Growing up, I always saw flares, just being in the oil and gas industry. I knew how wasteful it was,” Whitehead told CNBC on the sidelines of the North American Prospect Expo summit in Houston, a flagship event for the industry. “It’s a new way to not only lower emissions but to monetize gas.”', 'Whitehead tells CNBC they have signed deals with more than 20 oil and gas companies, four of which are publicly traded. Giga also says they’re also in talks with sovereign wealth funds, and they are expanding, fast. Giga’s 11-person team is adding another six employees this month.', 'Lohstroh and Whitehead are part of a growing movement of people placing big bets on the potential for bitcoin mining to transform the economics of the energy industry.', '“They are making their clients revenue through stranded energy bitcoin mining and solving the environmental challenge with flared gas at the same time,” said Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council.', 'The Giga executives are also big believers in the power of bitcoin to create a new kind of financial freedom.', '“No one controls it, and you don’t have to ask permission to use it,” said Lohstroh. “That’s really what drew me to bitcoin.”', 'It’s a similar sentiment for Whitehead, who tells CNBC that his views on self sovereignty, privacy, and individualism are part of what sent him down the proverbial bitcoin rabbit hole.', '“I wasn’t so much focused on the price, as I was the adoption. I thought this was something great for humanity,” said Whitehead.', 'You can think of bitcoin mining both as the security layer for the network and as the method by which new bitcoin are entered into circulation.', 'A bitcoin mining rig runs a program on a computer to try to solve a puzzle before anyone else does. Solving that puzzle is what completes a block, a process that both creates new bitcoin and updates the digital ledger keeping track of all bitcoin transactions. ', '“The cool thing about bitcoin that is under-appreciated by a lot of the naysayers is that it’s a portable market; you can bring it right to the source of energy,” said Steve Barbour, founder of Upstream Data, a Canadian company that manufactures and supplies portable mining solutions for oil and gas facilities.', 'Enter the oil and gas business, which often features sites in remote parts of Texas, far from major population centers.', 'More often than not, if a gas well isn’t already stationed near a pipeline, it won’t be big enough to warrant the time and expense of building an entirely new line. And if a driller can’t immediately find a way to sell the stash of natural gas, most dispose of it on site.', 'One method is to vent it, which releases methane directly into the air – a poor choice for the environment, as its greenhouse effects are shown to be much stronger than carbon dioxide. A more environmentally friendly option is to flare it, which means actually lighting the gas on fire. ', 'But flares are only 75 to 90% efficient, explained Adam Ortolf, who heads up business development in the U.S. for Upstream Data. “Even with a flare, some of the methane is being vented without being combusted,” he said.', 'This is when on-site bitcoin mining can prove to be especially impactful.', 'When the methane is run into an engine or generator, 100% of the methane is combusted and none of it leaks or vents into the air, according to Ortolf. ', '“But nobody will run it through a generator unless they can make money, because generators cost money to acquire and maintain,” he said. “So unless it’s economically sustainable, producers won’t internally combust the gas.”', 'Bitcoin makes it economically sustainable for oil and gas companies to combust their methane, rather than externally combust it with a flare, rendering stranded gas a thing of the past.', 'But Ortolf has taken years to convince people that parking a trailer full of ASICs on an oil and gas field is a smart and financially sound idea.', '“In 2018, I got laughed out of the room when I talked about mining bitcoin on flared gas,” said Ortolf. “The concept of bringing hydrocarbons to market without a counterparty was laughable.”', 'Fast forward four years, and business at Upstream is booming. It now works with 140 bitcoin mines across North America.', '“This is the best gift the oil and gas industry could’ve gotten,” said Ortolf. “They were leaving a lot of hydrocarbons on the table, but now, they’re no longer limited by geography to sell energy.” ', 'Meanwhile, bitcoin miners get what they want most: cheap electricity.', '“The thing about oil and gas is that it is a very distributed and reliable power source, and because of that, a distributed sales point and reliable power draw like a bitcoin mine is quite a good fit,” said Barbour. “It’s sort of a match made in heaven actually.”', 'The summer before his junior year in college, Whitehead was mowing his parents’ lawn in the southeast Texas town of Buna (population circa 2,000 people) when he got a text from Lohstroh, then a classmate and friend. In it, Lohstroh suggested they buy a mobile bitcoin mining container from Upstream Data and hitch it to a gas well themselves.', '“I just instantly stopped the lawn mower, walked straight to my dad, and I was like, ‘I gotta find flare gas right now,’” said Whitehead.', 'It was a natural reaction for Whitehead, who comes from a long line of “wildcats,” a term used to describe those who engage in high-risk exploratory drilling.', '“I call myself a digital wildcatter because now this is this next phase of wildcatting — bitcoin mining going to natural gas wells,” he said.', 'A week after Whitehead got the text, he and Lohstroh hopped on a plane up to Canada. Logistical acrobatics ensued, including having to drive a U-Haul truck three hours to Upstream’s facility in Calgary since neither was old enough to rent a car, but the pair wasn’t phased.', 'Upstream’s lead engineer and founder, Steve Barbour, tells CNBC he initially tried to warn Lohstroh not to make a purchase, since the container was still being field tested, but Lohstroh was committed to getting an order in.', '“True bitcoiners those two...they’re go-getters,” Barbour said of the Giga co-founders. “Both of them are what I, as a Canadian, think of Texans — entrepreneurial and wholesome. Just awesome dudes.”', 'Once the college classmates had the physical equipment they needed, they leveraged a connection who had some flare gas.', 'From there, they pounded the pavement looking to drum up business. At the 2020 NAPE summit, the Giga co-founders say they handed out about a thousand pamphlets trying to sell people on the idea of monetizing stranded gas.', '“A lot of people didn’t know about it. Most people laughed at us. Most people said, ‘It’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard,’” Whitehead said. Others said it was cool, but they didn’t think it would work, and then, there were a few who said we needed to talk to the company’s CEO.', 'Then came the pandemic.', '“Covid hit and shut down the world,” Whitehead told CNBC. Despite nationwide lockdowns, Giga continued to run 35 miners at its launch site, but business development virtually ground to a halt.', '“There was no traction in the space,” said Lohstroh. “Bitcoin was in a bear market. We were running around to meetings trying to draw up interest about bitcoin mining, and there was no interest at all.”', 'The team got creative by tracking down smaller customers in north and east Texas who were either “breaking the rules” or couldn’t get permits and were just wasting the gas. As Whitehead describes it, these smaller companies were often the ones that neglected regulatory compliance.', '“We were able to come in and say, ‘Hey, you’re flaring, and you shouldn’t be. You’re doing stuff that’s illegal, and you have opportunity here, because you have a shut-in well. We can take all this gas,’” recounted Whitehead.', 'But the real turning point for the company came in Dec. 2020, when the price of bitcoin broached the $20,000 threshold. That’s when some of the bigger players in the oil and gas industry started to take note, and leaders from publicly-traded companies began to approach them about getting into business.', 'Giga has also had companies fly in from abroad to shadow their operations and learn how the process works.', '“We’ve had people from companies in Saudi Arabia come to our sites in East Texas. And you know, they’ve probably never even seen a pine tree before, and we’re bringing them out for barbecue and showing them a bitcoin mine. They love it,” said Whitehead.', 'Giga tells CNBC that its revenue was more than $4 million in 2021, and it’s on track to earn more than $20 million by the end of 2022.', 'Whitehead says that some of their mining sites have helped to revitalize the local economy by creating jobs, such as field technicians and bitcoin pumpers, who go out to check the sites. In the small communities where they’ve set up a bitcoin mine, they are sometimes the largest source of revenue.', '“An area that was just a ghost town has now found ways to take their stranded energy that they were wasting and monetize it, and that’s what gets me excited, because like that’s what is helping the community overall,” said Whitehead.', 'Countless bitcoin miners now say that oil and gas is going to dominate the crypto mining industry in the coming decades, which bodes well for Giga’s business model.', '“It’s a frenzy out there,” said Barbour.', 'But Lohstroh tells CNBC the next stage is for the energy producers themselves to become the bitcoin miners.', '“I think that’s the next large transition, whether that’d be power producers, natural gas producers, upstream, midstream, downstream. I think at all sectors within the industry space, they’re going to be affected by bitcoin mining, because bitcoin mining is innately tied to power, and the point of energy is to create power. And so I think you’re gonna see a lot of semantics and how they’re interrelated,” he said.']"

Also, no, the shipping and ports situation isn’t much better, despite what you may hear. Rather, the ships are just moving further offshore. And sorry Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell, unless you learn how to farm or unload containers, a few interest rate hikes won’t matter much in the near term.

The pandemic has brought family back in focus. That’s a good thing. Birth rates in the U.S. have been declining forever. That should change next year. Is there a kid-centric ETF? There should be.

Sure, Japan’s got a stagnant economy. Has for years. Numerous recessions in the past few decades. And hey, Japan needs a baby boom so bad that the government has come up with policies to incentivize family creation. But from a company perspective, Japan has got it going on. Valuations of Nikkei companies are well below that of the S&P 500, even as earnings are growing. Oh, and Japan’s fiscal policy is as easy as ours. The analysts at Jefferies see value in many Japanese companies like Sony, Toyota, Suzuki, Subaru, Denso and others.

Electric vehicles (EVs) are still a tiny tot in the American car market. They account for about 4% of passenger car sales, according to BloombergNEF. They’re hampered by high prices and worries about battery life. That changes in 2022. The number of electric models available will double to about 20. It’s still just a fraction of the 300 or so total models available, but meaningful for two reasons. First, you no longer need to be a bitcoin billionaire to afford an EV. Next, we’re getting what Americans really want: trucks and SUVs. Between the Ford F-150 Lightning and the Rivian R1T (Motor Trend truck of the year for 2022), along with midsized so-called “cute utes” like the Volkswagen ID.4, there are the options American families want (especially if we get the aforementioned baby boom).

As I found out on a 517-mile road trip in an all-electric Polestar in August, range anxiety is a real thing. But as more charging stations get built and drivers can see they won’t have to worry about where to charge when not home, it will be a positive upward cycle that sends sales higher.', '\u200bPrediction: Copper and palladium look like gold', 'Want to build an EV?

(Or, maybe not quite yet, if you think the new CEO will have enough time to right the ship.)', 'On Friday, news broke in The Wall Street Journal that Amazon was taking a look at Peloton. Later, it came out that Nike was too. And then we got a repeat of the same M&A fanfiction that’s been going on since before Peloton went public: What about Apple?', 'Some of the best Apple-watchers thought it was likely to be a serious discussion within Apple. Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush, wrote Sunday night Apple could buy Peloton as a defensive move against a Big Tech rival like Amazon grabbing it first. He called the potential acquisition a “strategic fit.”', 'Many others have thought the same for years now, and Apple is right back in the conversation now that we know a Peloton sale is more likely now than it has ever been.', 'But there are far more reasons Apple will decide to take a hard pass on Peloton, if its history has been any guide.', 'Apple rarely makes large acquisitions. Peloton’s market cap was a bit more than $12 billion by Tuesday afternoon. Apple has never even come close to buying a company that large. Its largest acquisition to date was Beats for $3 billion.

We usually only find out about an Apple acquisition after someone in the press reports on it.', 'Apple tends to buy companies for their technology and staff. These are called “acquihires,” which is when a larger company buys a smaller one and integrates their employees and technology into new or existing products. For example, your iPhone’s weather app got a big update last year because Apple acquihired a company that made a weather app called Dark Sky.', 'Apple is obsessed with making its own hardware and software, and keeping high profit margins. Peloton makes giant Android tablets with clunky software, connected to exercise gear. Plus, Peloton continues to lose money and its margins would put a drag on Apple’s own margins if the two companies merged.', 'Pelton’s fourth-quarter earnings report from Tuesday morning paints a dismal picture for the company’s 2022. The company reported disappointing subscriber numbers, canceled plans to build a $400 million factory in Ohio and fired 2,800 employees. It’s hard to imagine what Apple would find appealing in that report.', 'Apple doesn’t need Peloton’s subscribers. Peloton has 6.6 million subscribers, a relatively tiny number compared to the 785 million paid subscribers Apple says it has through App Store apps. Plus, some of those Apple subscribers include Peloton customers who signed up through the App Store, meaning Apple already gets a cut of some of Peloton’s subscription revenue today.', 'But wait! Couldn’t Apple surprise us like it did when it bought Beats? Sure, if you want to compare stationary bikes to LeBron’s favorite headphones.', 'Apple bought Beats primarily for its streaming music service, which it transformed into Apple Music a year after the companies merged. On top of that, Beats had a profitable headphones business that could be improved with Apple’s technology. (Just look at today’s Beats headphones, which are full of the same slick tech you find in AirPods.)', 'Apple needed the streaming music service Beats already had in place in order to get a jump on the market leader Spotify. Keep in mind, this was eight years ago, early in Apple’s transition to growing its digital services business. Streaming music was a natural place to start.', 'In Peloton’s case, Apple doesn’t need a streaming fitness service (it already has one), and it doesn’t seem likely to start making treadmills or stationary bikes that lose money.', 'Instead, growth in Apple’s fitness business will come from where it always has: Apple Watch sales (which continue to grow) and compatibility with other fitness equipment, like at Equinox gyms, or classes, like at Orange Theory.']"

The MSCI ACWI index is comprised of stocks under the MSCI world as well as emerging markets indices.', 'These are the top stocks that Morgan Stanley says are most “central” to supply chains.', 'Morgan Stanley also listed the companies it said were most pressured by supply chain bottlenecks.', '“Industries that fall into this category are ones that most acutely transmit the squeeze of supply chain pressures, partially because the companies within this cohort face persistent reliance on labor inputs in spite of increased automation or capital investment,” the firm said.', 'Coupled with other factors such as a reliance on markets subject to trade or other policy frictions, this “leaves such companies vulnerable to geopolitical and labor dynamics, but also crucial to global supply chains,” it said. Some examples include container shipping and semiconductor firms.', 'Such firms may be facing cost pressure, but they still hold pricing power by virtue of their industry position, according to Morgan Stanley.', 'These are the stocks that fall under the “bottleneck” category.', '“In the face of disruptions and capacity constraints, there are limited options except to raise prices to compensate for higher input costs or to ration capacity through backlogs,” Morgan Stanley said, of such firms facing bottlenecks.']"

But given that Macy’s dotcom sales have been outpacing same-store revenues for years — and that the company operates 788 stores across its portfolio — begs another question: Is Macy’s current management team, led by the “quintessential department store executive,” as one retail investor recently characterized Macy’s CEO Jeff Gennette, the best choice for leading the nation’s largest legacy department store into the new era of retail that is increasingly sophisticated, digital and dominated by digitally-native competitors like Amazon?', 'Both questions have dogged Macy’s since October, when activist investor Jana Partners implied in a presentation to investors that Macy’s could boost its valuation by spinning off its e-commerce business. Jana, with its history of pushing large retailers to shake up operations, took a stake in Macy’s and soon after that presentation urged the company’s board in a letter to spin off the digital arm, speculating that Macy’s online arm could be worth about $14 billion, roughly twice what Macy’s is valued at today.', 'Macy’s declined to comment ahead of earnings.', 'Jana Partners won’t comment on its stake in Macy’s, but a person familiar with the situation said that Macy’s is being urged to evaluate pursuing the same strategy followed by Saks Fifth Avenue of bringing in an investor to its dot-com business to accelerate its growth, highlight its value and better position it to attract top technology talent. This last point was underscored twice recently at Saks, first when a former Amazon exec joined the board of the new Saks.com — which is reportedly readying its initial public offering — and then over the summer, when another former Amazon executive took the COO role at the new standalone Saks Off 5th e-commerce company.', '“Companies are going to be learning from people who aren’t necessarily in their own swim lanes,” said Bernadette Nixon, CEO of Algolia, a technology firm that helps retailers optimize their e-commerce.

Gennette has been with Macy’s almost exclusively since 1983, when as an undergraduate at Stanford University he was hired into its executive trainee program.

In an effort to capitalize on its most valuable customers — those who shop at Macy’s both in-person and online tend to spend three times more than those who only shop at one or the other — Macy’s has invested in data analytics so it can follow when and what they shop, then tailor incentive programs and product messaging to them.', 'Macy’s is also using social media and digital messaging to try and drive people to their stores, although analysts say there are still too many locations.', '“The retail landscape has been changing at a slow rate and the pandemic sped it up — there were way too many stores in the U.S.,” says Jessica Ramirez, a retail research analyst with Jane Hali and Associates. “With Macy’s, its square footage was ridiculous. However, there is still excitement within apparel to visit a store; you just need something to lure customers in.”', 'The place for brick-and-mortar stores in the future of retail will be as channels for branding, say analysts. “You still have people who grew up in the late 1980s and 1990s running large companies with physical assets stuck on this idea of a physical store being a profit center, and that’s no longer going to be true,” says Lee Peterson, executive vice president at WD Partners, a retail consultancy. “The mentality needs to change to, physical is all about brand and online is about buy. What’s going to make me really want to go to a department store?”', 'Making Macy’s stores a destination will require innovation.

Macy’s has also partnered with Toys R Us to exploit toy sales, a sector that bloomed during the pandemic and brought in new customers — millennial parents — many who came for toys then who went on to buy higher-margin goods, Gennette said on the call.', 'While analysts aren’t so sure about the long-term growth potential of building out mini toy shops inside Macy’s stores, they see lots of upside in Macy’s using its stores to provide customers with additional places to pick up or return things they ordered online. Perfected by Target and Walmart during the pandemic, the idea of using physical stores for curbside pickup and other distribution efforts has been so effective that even Amazon wants in; it’s likely part of the reason why it’s planning on opening its own brick-and-mortar department stores. “It makes sense why Amazon wants to open stores—they’re getting inventory closer to their customers,” says Ramirez. “It’s that last mile that everyone is fighting for.”', 'Pent-up customer demand to return to stores in person post-pandemic was a big factor in Macy’s stellar second quarter results — net sales rose 58.7% year over year to $5.6 billion and comparable sales were up 61.2%. Morningstar forecasts an operating margin of 7% on 36% sales growth for 2021, which would be Macy’s highest since 2015. While Swartz says those margins might not be sustainable for the long term, he doesn’t think spinning off Macys.com is the answer.', '“This idea of splitting these businesses up goes contrary to integrating the physical stores with the dot com stores — the industry is changing in a way that there’s almost no line between those two businesses anymore,” he says. “Macy’s whole strategy has been to try and bolster both by using them together to increase sales and reduce costs on shipping, fulfillment and distribution.”', 'Other skeptics are questioning the long-term viability of separating Macy’s two business streams, especially in a bubbly environment where some digital firms may be overvalued. “Activist investors can often be engaged in simple financial engineering and aren’t thinking about shareholders but making a quick buck,” says James Hoopes, Murata Professor of Ethics in Business at Babson College. “Activist investors sometimes unlock wealth and sometimes they destroy wealth.”', 'Against the backdrop of extravagant valuations for digital businesses — only a few months after being separated financially from Saks, Saks.com is supposedly preparing for its IPO with media reports of a potential $6 billion valuation — Macy’s rapidly-growing e-commerce segment is undoubtedly attractive for impatient investors. Under Gennette’s watch, digital sales for Macy’s grew 7.7% in 2019 and 23.7% in 2020, although investors are wary that could be cannibalizing physical store sales.', 'It’s Macy’s giant department store footprint that has investors wondering if its executive team needs a little help pivoting to a business model where its brick-and-mortar entities better serve the needs of its dot-com. But as one retail investor put it, when it comes to Gennette, “Who better to succeed in making this pivot than a person who’s a dyed-in-the-wool brick-and-mortar guy? That would be one powerful message.”']"

But this year, between Apple’s privacy changes and the ongoing controversy over Facebook’s practices, more and more consumers are steering clear of Facebook’s apps, which include Instagram and WhatsApp. Or they’re turning to new ones, like TikTok.', 'The shift has brands worried that an online marketing blitz won’t reach the right customers. Some even fret that they could alienate consumers by being on certain social media sites.', '“When Covid happened, it affected everybody differently, but for many brands it created a really serious tailwind,” said Brian Berger, founder and CEO of the direct-to-consumer menswear brand Mack Weldon. “For this nine-month period of time [in 2020], all of us were back to the glory days of really being able to exploit ... being in the right place at the right time.”', 'There was a flight by major advertisers at the onset of the pandemic last March out of channels like Facebook, he said. Companies, including hotels and airlines, were either trying to conserve cash during an uncertain time or hoping to avoid striking the wrong tone with their ads during a health crisis. The companies that continued to market products were able to score top advertising real estate online for a lot less money. But this dynamic came to an abrupt halt earlier this year.', '“Then 2021 starts and vaccines start to roll out, people start to get more comfortable and life starts to become more normal again,” Berger said. “And we were right back to where it was 2019, overnight. Rates are back up. Competition is back up.”', 'The finishing blow came when Apple in April made privacy changes impacting how apps can track users. Many consumers have since opted out of tracking by popular apps, which means businesses are gathering less information on users’ daily habits and interests. As a result, it becomes much more difficult for advertisers to target people on the internet effectively.', 'Poshmark, an online marketplace for secondhand goods, said Wednesday that it’s having to overhaul its marketing strategy due to Apple’s privacy policy.

Representatives for Facebook and Patagonia didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.', 'According to Polly Wong, president of the full-service marketing strategy firm Belardi Wong, the troubles at Facebook became an even bigger headache for direct-to-consumer brands compared with traditional retailers. That’s because many of them got their start thanks to creative Facebook ads that directed customers to their websites, rather than relying on swaths of stores.', '“There’s no question that the vast majority of DTC [direct-to-consumer] brands build their business on Facebook, with Google being second,” Wong said. “But right now, more than half of our clients are seeing Facebook underperform.”', 'Belardi Wong’s clients include eco-friendly shoe brand Allbirds, the bedding maker Parachute, men’s clothing company Buck Mason and dozens of other direct-to-consumer businesses, according to its website.', 'An analysis by the market research company eMarketer found that users in the U.S. are expected to spend less time scrolling through Facebook this year and in the coming years. Time spent on the platform for adults over the age of 18 is expected to be down 3.3% in 2021 compared with 2020 levels, eMarketer said. It forecasts it will drop another 1.8% from 2021 to 2022, and fall another 0.7% in 2023.', '“As people have returned to their normal lives ... going to restaurants and gyms and traveling out and about, there’s less screen time. And less screen time, as a fact, means less impressions,” Wong said. “And when there are less impressions, but there’s still huge marketing demand, it drives the price of those impressions up. There’s more competition from advertisers for the same impressions.”', 'CPMs, a marketing term used to denote the price of 1,000 advertisement impressions, are skyrocketing, Wong said. Over the summer months, Belardi Wong was tracking 50% increases to CPMs on Facebook, she said. And the company is projecting CPMs could go up another 50% on top of that this holiday season.', 'More retail brands are testing out direct mail catalogs, podcasts and large-scale television campaigns to diversify their marketing mix, Wong said.

Snap has suggested this is the case.

Berger said Mack Weldon has been adding “ready to ship” messages to its marketing materials ahead of the holidays to emphasize to consumers that the items are readily available and in stock.', '“We have a global supply chain and we are not immune to issues,” Berger said. “We’ve had a lot of things related to holiday moving around. But we anticipated a lot of it and have been able to implement fallback plans for various types of marketing campaigns, based on delays.”', 'According to Wong, many companies fall in one of two camps. Either the retailer has enough products to sell, but might sell out before Black Friday, so it is encouraging shoppers to buy early. Or, the retailer is waiting on goods to arrive, so the business is holding off on marketing blitzes until then.', '“We actually have a few clients, unfortunately, where we couldn’t pull the trigger soon enough,” Wong said. “There are actually catalogs going home for some of our clients where half the products are not even available within the catalog.”', 'Correction: Poshmark’s shares closed down nearly 29% on Wednesday.

But now, they’ve also been tasked with prioritizing and tracking shipments of the coronavirus vaccine.', 'With a record number of people shopping on the web, holiday sales this year are expected by Adobe Analytics to rise by more than 30% from 2019 levels.

', 'Ben has spread his mining equipment across multiple sites so that no one operation stands out on the country’s electrical grid. He has also gone “behind the meter,” drawing electricity directly from small, local power sources that are not connected to the larger grid, such as dams. He’s taken steps to conceal his geographic digital footprint, as well.', 'Ben tells CNBC that he is used to “getting around things” when it comes to running a business in China, but the last six months have really raised the stakes. ', '“We never know to what extent our government will try to crack down…to wipe us out,” Ben said.', 'Ben is not alone. ', 'Although Beijing exiled its crypto miners in May and then doubled down on its mining ban in September and again in November, multiple sources tell CNBC that as much as 20% of all the world’s bitcoin miners remain in China. This is well off its peak of around 65% to 75% of the global market, but it is substantially more than an official estimate from Cambridge University that puts China’s current share at 0%. ', 'Data from Chinese cybersecurity company Qihoo 360 shows that underground crypto mining appears to be alive and well in China. In a November report, the research group estimated that there are an average of 109,000 active crypto mining IP addresses in China on a daily basis. Most of those addresses, according to the report, are in the provinces of Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shandong.', 'Crypto mining has survived in China, in part, because lot of miners weren’t sure whether Beijing was actually serious about the ban. ', 'China has repeatedly lashed out against digital currencies, but each time, the sting wore off, and the rules eventually softened. The country’s announcement this spring that it would be cracking down on crypto mining dovetailed with the centennial of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, a time when there was pressure on lawmakers to show strength. Some miners – especially smaller-scale operators who didn’t have the resources or the connections to migrate abroad – figured a lot of the crypto talk by the government was bravado, so they powered down, laid low for a few weeks, and then came back online, taking a few extra precautions when they did. ', 'But this crypto crackdown appears to be different for a few big reasons.', 'For one, China is short on power, a resource vital to the process of bitcoin mining. The country has been dealing with its worst energy shortage in a decade, resulting in power cuts.', 'Beijing has also made it clear that crypto mining stands in the way of its aggressive climate targets, as it pushes to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. In November, government spokesperson Meng Wei slammed bitcoin mining, calling it an “extremely harmful” practice and vowing stricter enforcement measures.', 'There’s looming competition from the digital yuan, as well. The country is testing its own central bank digital currency, which could grant the government greater power to track spending in real-time. Making it harder to transact in rival cryptocurrencies could be part of a larger plan to ensure adoption of this new central bank digital currency, according to Fred Thiel, CEO of Marathon Digital Holdings and a member of the Bitcoin Mining Council.', '“China’s government is doing everything they can to ensure that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies disappear from the Chinese financial systems and economy,” speculated Thiel. “Part of this is to ensure the adoption of China’s central bank digital currency, and part of this is most probably to ensure financial surveillance activities are able to see all economic activity.”', 'Whatever the impetus, the government’s growing hostility toward crypto-related endeavors is apparent.', 'In the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hebei, and Inner Mongolia, for example, the government has taken varying degrees of action, such as asking local officials to run their own self-compliance checks, screening IP addresses for illicit mining activity, raiding illegal underground crypto mines, and arresting and expelling party members suspected of participating in crypto mining schemes.', 'Authorities appear to be paying special attention to mining happening at research institutions, community centers, and schools, where electricity prices sometimes cost less than the going rate. In November, the government vowed to hike energy prices for institutions that use subsidized power to mine.', 'Authorities are also zeroing in on state-owned businesses taking part in the trade.', 'This week, China’s Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the country’s anti-corruption watchdog, said it had identified dozens of state-owned entities in the eastern province of Zhejiang that were using public resources to mine for twelve cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, ether, litecoin, and monero. Of the nearly 50 people who were penalized, 21 worked at state-owned enterprises or Communist Party agencies.', 'State-owned entities have been tied up in crypto mining schemes elsewhere, too.', 'In the coastal region of Jiangsu, the communication watchdog for the province found that 21% of the IP addresses participating in crypto mining were from state-owned institutions.', 'Despite the government’s significant and growing efforts to weed out all crypto miners, many, like Ben, have found ways to survive undetected.', 'When China began its crypto mining takedown in May, most of the industry went dark virtually overnight, as miners waited for the dust to settle.', 'CNBC spoke to multiple participants in China’s illicit crypto mining market, some of whom have spent time on the ground in China and others who have direct knowledge of how these operations continue to exist under the ever-increasing scrutiny of regulators.', 'The biggest players in the business, who already had connections overseas and cash to spare, got out fast. Many shipped their gear and moved their teams to Kazakhstan, the U.S., and other international destinations with low-cost power and available hosting capacity.  ', 'Some heavy hitters left their gear sitting in warehouses in Asia and headed to greener pastures empty-handed, instead placing orders for the latest-generation machines to be delivered to their new homes abroad.', 'But smaller miners with limited disposable income and fewer international connections found it hard to relocate thanks to pandemic-related travel restrictions, supply chain and shipping bottlenecks, and trade war headwinds between China and the U.S.', 'Selling gear wasn’t all that effective as an off-ramp either, as the flood of inventory into the resale market tanked the going rate for mining rigs.', 'Medium-sized miners were “100% screwed” in this year’s crackdown, according to one expert speaking to CNBC. They couldn’t offload their equipment to recoup their losses, nor could they mine at full capacity again, because their electrical footprint is easy to pick out.', 'But for the smaller mines, like the ones Ben runs, it’s been easier to fly under the radar. Some divided their mining operations into multiple farms across the country that the authorities were less likely to notice. Others piggybacked off small, local power sources, like tiny dams in rural areas that are not connected to the main electric grid.', '“Mining is no longer a big business,” said one bitcoin miner who has spent years minting crypto all over the world, including in China, and asked to remain anonymous for fear of the authorities. Instead, the industry has turned into more of a piecemeal operation, with “a couple thousand miners here, a couple thousand miners there.”', '“It’s more like a sort of band-aid to make money to help move the miners out of the country.”', 'Ben – who has been mining cryptocurrencies since 2015 – has one thousand mining rigs that are powered by grid electricity and another five thousand units tethered to hydropower, direct from the source in the southern province of Sichuan.', 'For the hundreds of miners running on grid power, Ben told CNBC that he has spread them out across the country, in order to evade detection by authorities.', '“They’re everywhere. You won’t find a pattern,” Ben said of the mining gear that he has plugged into industrial power lines wherever his friends will let him grab a bit of extra power.', 'This is now common practice for many miners, according to Marshall Long, who has been mining for cryptocurrencies for over a decade in places like Sweden, Iceland, and China.', '“They are drawing from the grid, and they are smaller scale now, so they are fragmented,” Long said, referring to his many friends who are mining in China under the radar. “They’re usually doing it in chunks of 20 megawatts or smaller, so they’re kind of like home-buying their way to allow them to small-scale mine.”', 'To put that into context, downtown Dallas uses 200 megawatts, and once the build-out is complete, America’s largest mine will have a total power capacity of 750 megawatts.', 'But Ben said the problem with this technique is that grid pricing is “really expensive.” Using off-grid power allows for much better profit margins, and it is easier to operate on the sly.', 'The wet season in China runs from May into the late fall, and monsoon-level rainfall translates to an abundance of hydropower, which is more easily captured from behind the meter.', 'Beijing’s crypto bans came as miners were already heading to Sichuan and Yunnan, two of the main provinces for crypto mining, thanks to their decentralized constellation of thousands of dams. Compared to the coal plants in the northern provinces of Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia, which were once bastions of the crypto mining network, these dams are less trackable and harder to identify – and therefore less accountable to government regulation.', '“There is definitely a lot of miners attached to hundreds upon thousands of hydro dams within Sichuan,” said Kevin Zhang of digital currency company Foundry, which helped bring over $400 million of mining equipment from China into North America.', 'In Ben’s case, most of his rigs run on hydropower. He has two sites in Sichuan. One is 12 megawatts and the second is eight megawatts. Ben told CNBC that in China, a mine that is above one megawatt at a single location is now considered sizable.', 'Even before the ban, it was increasingly standard practice for miners of means to rent (or build) their own transformers and substations, in order to provide power to mining sites directly from power plants. Transformers take the power from a substation and convert it to a lower voltage that can then be used to power bitcoin miners. ', 'At one of his locations in Sichuan, Ben paid a one-time fee to lease an entire power plant that operates off the grid, which is one way he lowers his chance of being found out.', 'While Ben has taken steps to hide his activity, he’s not totally immune to detection. He says that China Telecom, one of the country’s biggest telecommunications companies, doubles as the mining police in China by looking out for suspicious electricity usage.', 'Once identified, the chain of command becomes a game of telephone — China Telecom refers the activity to the central government, who then relays this information to the specific province or town where the alleged mining is happening. From there, according to Ben, the local government calls the power plant directly to investigate the allegation.', 'This recently happened to Ben, but he says he was lucky because the power plant owner likes him. When the government contacted the power plant about suspicious activity, the owner covered for Ben. After the call, Ben shut off the mine for a few days, took some extra steps to mask his network traffic, then powered back on.', 'This kind of IT hygiene is critical to keeping miners off the radar.', 'Miners conceal their IP address by using a virtual private network, or VPN, to mask their geographic digital footprint. But Beijing is wise to the use of VPNs as a tool to evade government censorship and has cracked down on their use.', 'Most underground miners are now turning to mining pools as another way to hide their tracks, joining cryptocurrency miners from around the planet to combine their computing power. Even though many mining pools have announced a suspension of services inside China, multiple sources tell CNBC that some foreign pools are still signing up Chinese miners.', '“They hide their hashrate,” explained Ben. Hashrate is an industry term used to describe the collective computing power of all miners in the bitcoin network.', 'Typically, when a block of transactions is “mined” and added to the digital ledger of transactions known as the blockchain, the pool that won it signs its name to the block. Multiple sources tell CNBC that now, when Chinese miners contribute their computing power to solving a block, pools opt to not sign their name, which is a departure from past protocol.', '“A pool doesn’t have to reveal any data,” continued Ben. “You’re basically telling the world that my revenue is only half of what I actually have. You don’t brag about it.”', 'This could help to explain why China’s share of the global bitcoin market went to zero practically overnight, since the bitcoin mining index is based upon data voluntarily shared by mining pools.', 'Though pools are quiet about working with Chinese miners, they have been very helpful to many of these underground operations behind the scenes, according to multiple sources.', '“There are some larger pools who still care. They actually provide a lot of technical support to help you, in case your own people don’t have the technical ability to set it up,” Ben said.', 'Long tells CNBC that many of these foreign pools provide them with technology that disguises what they’re doing.', '“They are encrypting their packets as it leaves the data center, so it just looks like ordinary web traffic,” Long said.', 'As Ben described it, one pool that he works with helped him to set up a server that made his mine look as though it had fewer “connection points.” When one IP address has thousands of connection points, each of which is submitting massive amounts of data, that looks suspicious to authorities, especially in a rural area like Sichuan. But Ben says that pools help miners get around that.', '“After they do their magic, you’re only going to see five machines, which then does not look suspicious, because any household can have that,” Ben said.', 'But China’s underground miners have a new and very big problem: The wet season is over.', 'In years past, miners would pack up their gear and truck it to either Xinjiang or Inner Mongolia to tap into the electricity generated by coal-powered plants. Both those regions are now closed off to miners.', '“It’s going to get really interesting,” said Zhang, who estimates that China’s share of the global bitcoin market will plummet to 5% as hydro dams dry up. “A lot of miners will have to capitulate and send gear abroad.”', 'Zhang told CNBC that it’s “very painful” when you have to unplug and re-route your miners over and over again, so he suspects that many will look to North America, where they can sign longer-term agreements. “It’s a more stable framework, and it’s not going to change on you overnight,” he said.', 'Ben is weighing that option right now.', 'But until he strikes a deal with an American host, Ben is in a bit of a holding pattern. Although he says he is selling some of his S19 series Antminer ASICs, for the most part, he’s hanging on to a lot of his machines until he figures out next steps.', '“These are essentially money printers,” explained Zhang, who made the point that these machines grant virtually instant access to bitcoin, or U.S. dollars if you liquidate your crypto stake. In a country with very tight capital controls, that kind of insurance policy is pretty valuable.', '“It’s a big reason why a lot of miners haven’t capitulated and sold their equipment, because for them, it’s access to capital overseas…once they get it plugged in,” said Zhang.', 'CLARIFICATION: CNBC has changed Ben’s name to further protect the person’s identity.']"

Among them: The Covid-19 pandemic has made it much more difficult for companies to gauge what consumers will be buying, social distancing must be enforced in e-commerce warehouses and delivery providers such as UPS and FedEx are in incredibly high demand and shipping costs are rising.', '“We face a different sort of problem today than early in the pandemic, when the issue was within the retailers’ warehouses, and the question was: Were they geared up enough to be able to pick [items] fast enough, and get it out to the shippers?” said Michael Brown, a partner in Kearney’s consumer products and retail practice.', '“Then, the issue became product availability: Was it in stock, and could companies really ship the items that the consumer had ordered?” Brown said. “Once they got over that hurdle, I think we’ve seen a prolonged period of successful shipping.”', 'But “coming into the holidays, we’re going to have all of the above problems combined into one,” he said.', 'Some in the industry have coined the term “shipageddon,” referring to a scenario where shipping capacity becomes totally maxed out. And that is exactly what everyone is hoping to avoid this holiday season.', 'Salesforce said it expects holiday packages being shipped from mid-November through next month will end up exceeding shipping capacity by 5% globally, putting 700 million packages at risk of being delayed.', 'So far this month, the three major parcel carriers in the U.S. are almost at “peak performance” getting packages to customers in time, according to Satish Jindel, president of parcel managing and logistics platform ShipMatrix. That should come as good news to everyone in the industry and sets a solid stage ahead of Monday.', 'From Nov. 1 through Nov. 14, on-time package delivery rates were: 96.5% at FedEx, 97.3% at UPS, and 96.6% for the U.S. Postal Service, according to ShipMatrix data. And from Nov. 15 through Nov. 21, they were: 96.6% at FedEx, 96.9% at UPS and 95.4% at USPS.', '“Retailers are doing the right thing by spreading promotions,” Jindel said.', 'The fact that holiday deals this year were pushed into early October, to align with a delayed Amazon Prime Day event, has helped the industry process a steadier flow of online transactions rather than an avalanche all at once, he said.', 'As much as $6 billion of Cyber Week purchases in the U.S. are expected to have been shifted into October this year, according to Salesforce data, as shoppers kicked off their holiday shopping earlier than ever before, tempted by the bargains and fearing things would soon run out of stock.', 'Retailers have been adjusting to the record-high online sales. During the second quarter, Best Buy reported year-over-year online sales growth of 242%. It tapered to a 174% increase during the third quarter, compared with the prior year. Target reported 195% e-commerce growth during the second quarter and a 155% increase during the third. Macy’s online sales jumped 53% during the second quarter and then were up 27% one quarter later versus the same period last year.', 'Cyber Monday will weed out the companies that haven’t risen to the challenge of higher volume, ShipMatrix’s Jindel said.', '“Nobody can scale up that fast,” he said. “You may have have heard the expression, ‘You don’t build a church for Easter Sunday.’ But the delivery carriers are going to have to accommodate people, even if the church is not big enough.”', 'Retailers are trying to manage shoppers’ expectations as well.

The company is the fourth pure-play space company to go public via a SPAC this year — following AST SpaceMobile, Astra, and Momentus — with several more expected before the end of 2021.', 'The company’s Lemur satellites are small and comparatively inexpensive, each one hosting a variety of instruments. Spire’s satellites help forecast weather, track ships at sea and airplanes in flight. ', 'Spire has about $265 million in cash on its books after the close of the deal, down from the $408 million the company expected to receive when it announced the merger in March. A Spire spokesperson noted that public stockholders filed to redeem about 90% of the firm’s outstanding shares — a high amount for a company that is going public.', 'But Platzer isn’t fazed by the redemptions, noting that the cash the company is receiving is “more money than Spire has ever had before and that Spire has spent and used in its nine-year history getting to this point.”', '“It’s a very unusual position for us to feel so exceptionally well-capitalized,” Platzer said.', 'Spire notably booked $36 million in revenue last year, and expects to nearly double that to $70 million in 2021. But the company needs to expand its customer base much further to reach $1.2 billion in revenue by 2025, which it forecast in its investor presentation.', 'The company has more than 110 satellites currently in orbit, in what Platzer describes as “the world’s largest multipurpose constellation.” Spire also has ground stations in 16 countries, with more than 70 antennas to quickly receive the satellite data and enter into its analytics platforms.', '“The starting point for us is a fully deployed global infrastructure,” Platzer said. “Everything is deployed, everything is operational at very high scale — processing terabytes of data, shipping to hundreds of customers.”', 'Now Spire is focused on “the monetization of that data,” he said, which it sells as an annual subscription service to customers. Platzer said Spire’s annual subscriptions are priced anywhere between tens of thousands of dollars to the “very high” millions.', 'Platzer gave the example of a Wall Street commodities trader focused on oil, who would want to know not just “where the ships are but where they will be” on the supply side but then use Spire’s analytics platform to look at the demand side, “which is driven by weather.”', 'Spire does not expect to grow its constellation of Lemur satellites, as they are refreshed on a three-year hardware replacement cycle. The company has done “tens of thousands of software upgrades over the last few years to make assets on orbit produce two to three times as much data,” Platzer said, and the company doesn’t see “any customer demand” that requires a larger constellation of satellites.', 'Spire’s growth strategy “is land and expand,” Platzer said.', '“You go into a particular use case, you land some customers, you grow those customers, and then you build around more customers,” Platzer added.', 'The company has offices in four countries so far — the U.S., the U.K., Luxembourg and Singapore — and customers in nearly 30 countries.', 'Platzer laid out a four-pronged growth strategy for Spire’s future: Hiring, geographic expansion, new data streams, and inorganic opportunities. Spire will focus on adding to its sales, marketing, and product teams in the near future. On the international side, Spire is looking to add customers in the Middle East and Asia, Platzer said, and being “a NYSE-listed company carries a lot of weight in opening doors.”', 'Finally, inorganic growth opportunities would include adding new technologies or new capabilities to Spire’s platform. One such capability Spire hopes to add is optical inter-satellite links, which would “drop the latency of the data dramatically,” Platzer said. Spire has tested radio frequency links with success in orbit, but optical inter-satellite links would take its capabilities a step further.']"

The first is its 600 Series bot, which Ocado said is lighter and more energy-efficient than its predecessor, with over half of its parts 3D printed.', 'The second is a set of advanced robotic arms that pick items directly off the grid in the company’s warehouses. Ocado says it’s developed artificial intelligence technology to enhance the precision of the arms to something closer to that of human pickers.', 'Meanwhile, Ocado also touted what it calls a “virtual distribution center” — essentially a combination of software smarts and small micro-fulfillment centers connected through one system. Ocado said the offering would maximize capacity of items in each warehouse while also slashing delivery times.', 'Shares of Ocado rose more than 5% on Wednesday. The stock has declined sharply in the past year, slumping 46%, with investors fretting over high-growth stocks as economies emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic and central banks begin to talk of tightening monetary policy.', 'The news comes as retailers face competition not only from Amazon, but a slew of upstarts offering grocery delivery in a matter of minutes. Firms such as Getir and Gorillas have emerged across Europe and parts of the U.S. recently, backed by a flood of cash from venture capitalists.', 'Such companies rely on so-called dark stores, tiny warehouses that are designed to ship online orders rather than serve customers in-store.', 'Tim Steiner, Ocado’s CEO, said he doesn’t think these rapid grocery players pose a meaningful threat to big retailers.', '“There’s very little differentiation between all the players out there,” Steiner said on a call with reporters Wednesday. “They’re all remarkably similar.”', 'Some start-ups have been acquired by larger players of late, with Getir buying U.K. rival Weezy and Gorillas snapping up French firm Frichti. Ocado’s chief said he’s “not surprised” to see consolidation in the sector given how crowded it’s become.', 'As for how the company plans to fund building all its new technology products, Steiner said cost shouldn’t be an issue since the new robots will be more capital-efficient than its current models. But he added the firm has enough cash on its balance sheet — as well as access to bank financing — to eventually deploy them at scale.', 'Ocado plans to roll out the products to its retail partners by the end of 2023. The initiatives are unlikely to have a material impact on Ocado’s full-year 2022 results, the company said.']"

The U.S. has put thousands of troops on heightened alert, meaning they are ready to deploy to the region should the crisis escalate.', 'The U.S., the U.K. and the EU have already said that Russia will be subjected to new sanctions on key individuals and sectors of its economy if it does invade Ukraine. Russia has already seen sectors like energy, finance and defense targeted by previous rounds of sanctions for its 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.', 'But the U.S. gave its clearest signal yet on Tuesday that it will look to cripple Russia’s economy — which would likely lead to immense pressure on Putin, both from the Russian people and the country’s business leaders — if Moscow invades its neighbor again.', 'Biden said Tuesday that he would feel obliged to beef up NATO defenses in Poland and Romania, in Eastern Europe, and when asked whether he could see himself imposing sanctions on the Russian president personally, he replied, “Yes, I would see that.”', 'The U.K. has signaled it could do the same with the country’s foreign secretary, Liz Truss, saying, “we are not ruling out anything” when asked if Putin could be sanctioned, Reuters reported Wednesday.', 'Threats of personal sanctions against Putin would be a big step up from previous measures against the Russian state and could see the West target Putin’s wealth and inhibit his travel, although no further details have been revealed.', 'The Kremlin responded to those comments on Wednesday, saying any personal sanctions on Putin would be politically destructive, but not painful, according to Reuters.', 'Senior White House officials told reporters Tuesday on a call regarding economic deterrence measures being considered against Russia that “we are prepared to implement sanctions with massive consequences that were not considered in 2014” when Russia annexed Crimea.', 'The measures they’re considering range from more financial sanctions to the use of “novel export controls” that could greatly impede Russia’s access to U.S.-made technology components, similar to those used against Chinese technology giant Huawei.', '“The gradualism of the past is out, and this time we’ll start at the top of the escalation ladder and stay there. We’ve made efforts to signal this intention very clearly,” one senior White House official said on the call.', 'Officials said the U.S. was also prepared to impose export controls — which would essentially block Russia from obtaining U.S.-originated software and technology in an effort to harm key economic sectors in Russia. These could hurt “Putin’s strategic ambitions to industrialize his economy quite hard,” they said. ', 'Such controls, they noted, “would impair areas that are of importance to him, whether it’s in artificial intelligence or quantum computing, or defense, or aerospace, or other key sectors.”', 'That’s not an exhaustive list with “all options” very much on the table, the official added, saying “we’re united with Allies and partners to decisively impose severe consequences on Russia if it further invades Ukraine.”', 'When asked if export controls could impact global supply chains, one official said there would be a minimal impact “because we’re talking about denying to Russia downstream products that are critical to its own ambitions to develop high-tech capabilities in aerospace and defense, lasers and sensors, maritime, AI, robotics, quantum, et cetera.”', '“And in each of these supply chains, we and/or our allies and partners design and produce the technology. And the export control would deny to Russia a sophisticated input that it can’t replace through domestic production or alternate supplies.”', 'Such sectors, the official noted, were deliberately earmarked as ones that “Putin himself has championed as the way forward for Russia to diversify its economy beyond oil and gas” — another sector that the U.S. could seek to undermine if Russia weaponizes energy supplies.', 'Europe’s energy sphere has become something of a battleground for Russia and the U.S. in recent years and the issue has come to the fore as tensions have grown over Ukraine.', 'Russia supplies the European Union with around 40% of its natural gas supplies, and has built a massive gas pipeline, Nord Stream 2, so it can send gas supplies directly to Germany, bypassing Ukraine. The U.S., which would like to increase its own liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, has condemned the project as damaging Europe’s energy security.', 'Indeed, the Biden administration has been looking at ways to secure energy for European allies in case Moscow decides to cut its energy supplies to the region in a bid to extract concessions over Ukraine.', 'One senior administration official, who declined to be named in order to share details of ongoing plans, told CNBC on Tuesday that the administration was coordinating with major buyers and suppliers of LNG to ensure a diversion of supplies to Europe if necessary.', 'Some analysts have pointed out that the latest signals coming from the U.S. on potential sanctions on Russia are the strongest they’ve seen.', '“I have been monitoring U.S. sanctions language on Russia since 2014 and what we are seeing below is a huge step up,” Timothy Ash, a senior emerging markets sovereign strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, said Tuesday night in a research note.', '“The U.S. officials are saying to Putin ‘bring it on, you go into Ukraine we are going to sanction you to hell, and try retaliation via cutting energy supplies to Europe. We are planning for that — we will get Europe thru the winter and you will end up as the loser.’ The U.S. is trying to help Europe break its energy dependence on Russia,” he noted.', 'Close followers of Russian politics believe that the current surge in tensions over Ukraine reflects Moscow’s (and more specifically, Putin’s) bid to reverse the expansion of Western influence in Russia’s backyard, and former territories, since the end of the Cold War and fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.', 'Sanctions remain one of the few options open to the West as there is little appetite to engage in a military conflict with Russia. Ukraine is not a member of NATO and, as such, the military alliance is not obliged to defend it.', 'But Western allies want to stop Russia from controlling and coercing (and invading) its neighbors. Russia, meanwhile, wants legal assurances that Ukraine will never be able to join NATO and for a rollback of the alliance’s deployments in Eastern Europe. The U.S. and NATO have refused those demands.', '“The Western allies have limited room for concessions” when it comes to Russia, according to Andrius Tursa, Central and Eastern Europe advisor at Teneo Intelligence.', '“They would risk undermining the credibility of the U.S. and NATO security guarantees, which form the backbone of the post-Cold War security architecture in Europe. After all, the demise of the post-Cold War security order seems to be one of the Kremlin’s key objectives,” he said in a note Tuesday.', '“Even if the current crisis is resolved through diplomacy, relations between Russia and the West appear to have approached a more hostile and unpredictable phase. The Kremlin’s perception of the US – and by extension NATO – as its main geopolitical rival is unlikely to dissipate until there are any meaningful changes in Russia’s political leadership.”', 'Markets have been on edge this week as Ukraine concerns have dominated global headlines, and there is little certainty over what Putin will do next.', 'On Tuesday, Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, said in note that “the heightened risk that he may invade Ukraine has started to affect markets ... this is not our base case. Still, it is among the tail risks that we need to ponder. Like other observers, we do not know what Putin is up to and what may happen next.”', 'Schmieding said Putin had already gained some victories at home from the crisis over Ukraine, with higher oil and gas prices a boon to energy exporter Russia.', '“Facing mounting concerns about falling living standards at home, Putin is currently reaping windfall gains from the surge in oil and natural gas prices,” Schmieding noted, adding that “with his sabre rattling, he has already achieved something. The world is talking about him. The U.S. and Russia are discussing the fate of Europe, occasionally even without Europe itself present at the table.”', '“Putin can present this to his domestic audience as a return to the times of the Cold War when the U.S. and the Soviet Union were the two global players that mattered most.”']"

In 2015, online sales made up less than 10% of its business.', 'Last year, Levi’s introduced a new experiential store in Palo Alto, California, as part of its push towards more direct-to-consumer sales and less wholesale.

Some of those stores will be the new experiential ones, the company previously announced.', '“We scaled up our investments in driving more of a digital experience,” Singh said. “We were able to test things and scale things at speeds we would have not said was possible pre the pandemic, and I think it’s really helped companies like ours because I think we’ve been able to get a lot more agile and been able to deliver the promise that we’ve set out to our consumers.”', 'The balance between the in-store and online experience during the pandemic also has led to changes in the way Levi Strauss thinks about its distribution infrastructure, which has grown in importance amid supply chain challenges.', 'Singh said that the omnichannel strategy on the consumer-facing side of the business led the company to take a look at legacy distribution centers — some that were only fulfilling products for wholesale customers, while other distribution centers were servicing the needs of e-commerce consumers. It recreated the omnichannel approach for its West Coast distribution after it began the ship-from-store strategy, and he said it leads to inventory efficiencies and a low cost of service.', '“I think things like that will make a big difference.

Twenty-one percent of its global sales in its most recent fiscal year took place in department stores, while sales in travel retail environments, such as duty-free shops in airports, made up 28% of its total sales.', 'How the balance between e-commerce and traditional brick-and-mortar sales continues to evolve will be an important question that retail companies ask themselves as more shopping shifts online.', 'Earlier this year, the owner of Saks Fifth Avenue split apart the luxury retailer’s website into a separate business apart from its 40 stores.

', 'For decades, the route through the U.K. (called a land bridge that takes approximately 15 hours) has been a vital and reliable artery for getting goods from Ireland to mainland Europe.', 'But with the end of the Brexit transition period on Dec. 31, trucks from the Republic of Ireland (which is still an EU member) traveling via the U.K. and entering the mainland through ports like Calais now face a great deal of paperwork and red tape.', 'In the first week of January, operators like Stena Line, Brittany Ferries and Irish Ferries have added extra routes from Ireland to French ports like Dunkirk, Cherbourg and Saint-Malo as well as Bilbao in Spain.', 'Three months into Brexit, port authorities, haulers and ferry operators are coming to grips with this new normal in Irish-European trade.', 'DFDS, the Danish shipping firm, recently added a route between Rosslare Europort in the southeast of Ireland to Dunkirk.', '“In general, we’re oversubscribed in capacity on most of the days,” Aidan Coffey, route director at DFDS, told CNBC.', '“There are three ships at the moment rotating the schedules. That’s going to go up to a fourth ship very shortly.”', 'The journey takes about 24 hours and is longer than it would typically take to drive through the land bridge.', 'Laurence O’Toole is managing director of logistics company O’Toole Transport, which carries various mixed loads on its trucks, including seafood. Pre-Brexit, the majority of its journeys went through the U.K. to reach Europe but now it’s putting more trucks on these new routes.', '“I’d say now it’s flipped on its head completely,” O’Toole said.', 'For Rosslare Europort, the evolving dynamic of freight transport has increased activity at its berths. The port, over 100 miles south of Dublin, has proven a popular location for ferries to link with ports in France and Spain.', 'Glenn Carr, the general manager of Rosslare Europort, told CNBC that demand at the port has surged, but U.K. freight traffic is down about 43%.', '“It’s still very concerning, that level of drop on the U.K. But overall freight through Rosslare Europort, combined U.K. and Europe, is up 51% for the first two months of the year. That type of growth has never been seen in Rosslare,” Carr said.', '“The demand seems to be still increasing. We’re certainly in discussions with possible other operators and other services.”', 'He said ship operators had to move fast in getting routes ready. Typically a route is bedded in and gradually grows in demand over an 18-month period before it reaches capacity, but most journeys are at full capacity now.', '“It’s unprecedented and certainly in talking to the shipping lines they wouldn’t have seen an uptake of a new service like that ever before,” Carr said.', 'However, it is still only three months into this new environment – while coronavirus shocks to trade continue to be felt too – and shippers continue to adjust. It also remains to be seen how much of the land bridge traffic will eventually return in the coming months.', '“But the conversations are about further expansion (of direct routes), it’s not about any contraction,” Carr said.', 'Rosslare Europort has commenced a 35 million euro ($41.3 million) investment plan for renovating and expanding facilities at the port to meet this demand. Works will run over the next four years.', 'In Dublin Port, operators expect that the dock will reach throughput capacity between 2030 and 2040. It has opened a consultation on what its long-term future will look like beyond 2040 as the construction of any additional facilities on the east coast of Ireland would take up to 20 years to design, build and bring into full operation. ', 'These direct routes have not been a total panacea for the challenges Brexit has wrought on Irish freight companies, according to O’Toole.', 'These sailings take longer, often between 18 and 24 hours, and depending on what port a ferry docks in, it can add more miles to a truck’s onward journey.', 'Trucks that land in Cherbourg but whose destination is in Northern France, the Benelux countries, Germany or beyond, face many more miles, hours and fuel costs. Dunkirk meanwhile is close to Calais making for familiar surrounds for drivers used to the land bridge.', '″(Direct routes) are more expensive and they’re slower, which is never good in the transport business,” O’Toole said.', '“It does avoid a whole pile of paperwork but for our customers and ourselves, costs have gone up. We’re trying to get that back off our customers. It’s not easy with Covid, nobody has got money to throw around so we’re trying to keep everything as tight as possible.”', 'He said that direct routes still can’t compete with the efficiencies of the pre-Brexit land bridge.', ' ']"
39,"Elon Musk endorses a carbon tax, downplays concerns about methane",2021-10-08T00:29:14+0000,"['Tesla CEO Elon Musk once again endorsed the idea of a federal carbon tax at the company’s 2021 annual shareholder meeting on Thursday.', 'He said the three parts of a “sustainable future,” in his view, are solar and wind power, batteries for energy storage, and electric vehicles of every kind including cars, boats and airplanes.', '“As we move to a sustainable energy grid and electric vehicles, then obviously we move to a fully sustainable energy economy which is where we want to get to as quickly as possible. The sooner the better! And can there be a carbon tax? I mean like, what the hell,” Musk said Thursday, expressing impatience.', 'A carbon tax, or tax on greenhouse gas emissions, has long been proposed as a way to reduce the emission of gases that cause climate change, particularly carbon dioxide. Some advocates believe that a carbon tax should increase over time to give industry time to discover and roll out lower-carbon alternatives to the products and processes they use that do emit CO2.', 'More than 40 governments have adopted some sort of price on carbon, according to the New York Times, but the United States has not.', 'A carbon tax would help Tesla by making gas more expensive, which would make its electric vehicles more attractive, and by increasing energy prices, which could encourage homeowners to adopt solar panels from Tesla and other providers. Musk acknowledged as much, but noted it would hurt his re-usable rocket business, SpaceX, a considerable consumer of fossil fuels that plans to drill for natural gas and to use methane in its rocket operations in Boca Chica.', '“So how about a carbon tax? We just really need it,” he said.', 'Musk also strongly endorsed the idea of getting more materials out of spent batteries through improved recycling technology and processes.', '“Battery materials are definitely recyclable. Burning gas is not. CO2 is an extremely stable molecule. Mars’ atmosphere has been primarily CO2 for I don’t know billions of years. It’s extremely stable. So, sometimes people worry about methane. Do not worry too much about methane. Methane quickly breaks down into CO2. Methane is not a stable molecule. CO2 is extremely stable,” Musk urged his audience, as if seeking to justify SpaceX’s use of methane.', 'According to the Environmental Protection Agency, “Methane is more than 25 times as potent as carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere.” Methane is also the second most abundant greenhouse gas emitted through human activity and industry, second after carbon dioxide. It accounts for about 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions.', 'At the annual shareholder meeting, Musk also spoke about Tesla’s aim to build cars closer to where customers order them. Doing so can save the company shipping costs, but also reduce its environmental footprint from shipping, Musk suggested.', '“The sheer amount of money we’re spending on flying parts around the world is not great,” Musk said. “It makes sense to have production on the continent where the consumers are.”', 'Currently, Tesla has a new factory underway near Austin, Texas, which is expected to produce batteries on-site, and another outside of Berlin, Germany.', 'On Thursday, Tesla also confirmed that it has moved its headquarters to Austin.', 'Musk expects the Texas factory, dubbed Giga-Austin, to follow in the footsteps of Tesla’s Shanghai factory, which now produces more electric cars than are made in its original factory in Fremont, California.', 'At least year’s annual shareholder meeting, Musk proclaimed that battery and manufacturing advances Tesla is working on could soon lead to lower priced cars from the company. “About 3 years from now, we’re confident we can make a very compelling $25,000 electric vehicle that’s also fully autonomous,” he said then. Tesla also said last year that it designed and was producing its own 4680 battery cells at a facility in Fremont, California.', 'On Thursday, Musk did not give an update on timing for a $25,000 electric vehicle.', 'But he did say that Tesla would not be producing 4680 battery cells in Texas this year. Instead, it would produce these cells at its pilot facility in Fremont, and ship them to Texas to as Model Y production ramps up there.', 'Long-term Musk said he believes the crossover utility vehicle is likely to become Tesla’s best-seller, surpassing the Model 3 sedan in popularity.', 'Earlier this month, Tesla said it delivered 241,300 electric vehicles during the third quarter of 2021, and produced 237,823 cars in the same period.', 'Deliveries are the closest approximation to sales reported by Tesla. The company achieved a new record as other automakers’ deliveries declined compared to the same time last year, owing largely to supply chain issues including a global chip shortage.', 'Musk doesn’t see global supply chain issues resolving fully until 2023, he said Thursday.']"
40,What investors can learn from all the Tesla and Rivian buying and selling,2021-11-23T15:10:09+0000,"['Rivian shares have been under pressure, but at a market capitalization of over $100 billion, bigger than GM and Ford, it would be hard to say the electric vehicle upstart isn’t a major success. The buying and selling action in EV stocks lately has been intense, from all the fuss over Elon Musk’s selling of Tesla shares to former Tesla executive Peter Rawlinson’s Lucid Group, which went public earlier this year and is now at a valuation over $80 billion, just about as big as the Detroit stalwarts.', 'As the stock market faces a new test after President Joe Biden reappointed Jerome Powell to lead the Federal Reserve, leading to market calls that investors are about to cycle back into value stocks and away from the hottest growth names ahead of interest rate hike pressures, Tesla’s competitors have been giving back some gains. Are EV stocks in a bubble?', 'CNBC recently spoke with Nick Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research and a former Wall Street auto industry analyst, about what’s going on in the EV space.', 'Rivian’s valuation is extremely high, according to Colas. “There is no getting around that. Any time you are talking about a company that hasn’t sold any product yet and has a $100 billion valuation it is a huge valuation, but it is not necessarily a bubble,” he said.', 'Tesla itself did not have an $80 billion-plus market cap until early 2020, Colas noted in a recent research note, and by then, it was producing 100,000 vehicles a quarter. Rivian is just starting to ship its first customer vehicles now.', 'The recent investor interest in EV stocks and their valuation gains reflects one element of what makes a bubble: an imbalance between the supply of a particular investment desire and demand. Market bubbles can form when too much money is put to work in a particular area that is short on supply. Overall, Colas isn’t worried about the stock market being in a bubble that pops any time soon because the liquidity in the market remains high, as do household savings which will continue to pursue market gains. But within the longer-term EV story, there is the fact that investors are chasing the few names available to them.', '“Investors are looking for any possible play in autonomous vehicles and EVs and there is a real shortage of opportunities, and that’s why a Tesla or Rivian is so highly valued. Because there aren’t enough EV stocks out there,” Colas said. “You do have to provide the market with what it wants, or it creates bubbles to some degree.”', 'Colas, though, isn’t ready to call a bubble in EVs. He says the whole ecosystem of EVs is exactly the way the auto industry was a century ago, which started out very fragmented and then took 80 years to come down to the Big Three. “In EVs, it could be eight years,” he said.', 'And Rivian, at a $100 billion valuation, is a company no institutional investor can afford to ignore.', '“They saw what happened with Tesla and know what can happen in this space,” he said.', 'With a $100 billion market cap, every institutional investor in the U.S. and around the world has to take Rivian seriously. And if they own Tesla already, the investors need to make a decision to keep all their Tesla or sell some and buy some Rivian, “just on the off chance that maybe it’s not a Tesla but a half-trillion company, and in that case, it’s a five-bagger from here,” Colas said.', '“We’ve done enough IPOs over the years to know some investors cycle through new companies as they go public, selling the ‘old’ name and replacing it with the ‘new,‘” Colas wrote in a recent note to clients. “Tesla has been the only ‘real’ EV play in U.S. equity markets for years. Now it has competition for the marginal investor.”', 'Rivian is a hot stock, and it is very volatile, and it will continue to be volatile, Colas says, because EV stocks trade more like stock options than underlying stocks.', '“It’s a long-dated option more than a stock,” Colas said. “It’s an option on Rivian being highly successful in EVs. Tesla was the same way earlier in its history, an option on the potential future.”', 'So the recent volatility in Rivian will repeat for reasons other than a Fed-induced growth to value cycle, and investors should remember that options are always more volatile than underlying stocks, and that volatility will move around with how much the market discounts its chances of being highly successful.', 'Trading in Tesla options, as an example, has dwarfed that of the broader market and other mega-cap tech stocks like Amazon, according to a recent FT article.', 'Given the volatility in EVs, investors probably should play both sides of the trade, with some of the exposure to the upstarts, including Telsa and Rivian, and a foothold in the legacy players, “not necessarily because they are going to win the space, but they do have the building blocks that can allow them to win,” Colas said.', 'That’s something Ford’s CEO said last week when it announced that a deal to jointly develop an EV with Rivian was being scrapped (it’s still an investor in the company). Ford CEO Jim Farley referenced the automaker’s “growing confidence” to “win in the electric space” as reasoning to end the collaboration.', 'But the current market approach to valuing EV pure-plays higher than Ford or GM is showing the long-term risk that is in the older automakers.', '“The legacy automakers face some incredible challenges, the likes of which we have never seen, and it makes the incursion of the Japanese and South Korean automakers look small by comparison,” Colas said. “It is a big change in technology that so far they have addressed by building out EVs in-house and leaving the companies combined.”', 'He doesn’t view that approach as an advantage.', 'Right now, the way the market is valuing Tesla, Rivian and Lucid Group relative to Detroit is sending the message to investors that “the combination of the old combustion engine business and EV business tied up in that is not a great investment thesis,” Colas said.', 'The critical factor will be to what degree GM and Ford might ultimately spinoff off EV operations, and that presents one potentially compelling reason to hold onto the shares.', '“The two themes have nothing to do with each other and that breakup is a possibility and one reason you might want to own the stocks,” he said.', 'But he is not confident that Ford or GM will ever make that move, even if the case can be made it’s the right one.', '“GM and Ford still have time left on the clock. But as for a dramatic corporate remake that reflects the existential challenges they face … We’re not holding our breath,” Colas wrote in a recent research note. ', 'If GM and Ford stick to their current corporate structure, Colas sees few to no advantages and one distinct disadvantage: their cost of capital.', 'It is much higher for Ford and GM, both under $100 billion in market cap, than it is for Tesla at $1 trillion. This is the Tesla stock sale that means a lot more to the EV market competition than the recent Musk action.', 'If Tesla needs $10 billion in capital, it can sell $10 billion in stock at 1% dilution for current shareholders. If GM or Ford did that, it’s roughly 10% dilution.', '“That’s how big the difference is in cost of capital. ... GM and Ford’s combined cost of capital and is ridiculously high and unsustainable,” Colas said. “Because the minute the EV industry gets a big tailwind from mass adoption, we will see a lot of new technology come out and all of these companies will have to invest a ton and the big domestic automakers will not be as well positioned as a Rivian or Tesla.”', 'Public filings reviewed by CNBC show that Tesla is spending at least $1 billion on its Austin, Texas-based “Gigafactory.”', 'Electric vehicles eventually imply autonomous vehicles and a reshaping of global transportation. That will require companies to have considerable equity currency for M&A and strategic investments.', '“With where GM and Ford’s stock prices currently sit, they will be bringing a penknife to a gunfight,” Colas wrote in a recent note.', 'This is a big reason why Colas sees a stand-alone valuation for the EV business as an advantage. “It is not that Ford and GM can’t compete in EVs or AVs – they can,” he wrote in a recent note. “It is that their chances improve materially if they can have an equity currency that goes toe–to–toe with Tesla and (now) Apple.” ', 'When it comes to cash to invest in the future of autos, there is a reason why so much speculation surrounds Apple’s interest. With a business generating as much cash as Apple’s quarter after quarter, investors do need to take Apple’s potential entry into the autonomous vehicle and electric vehicle market seriously, Colas says.', 'Apple won’t say anything, with Tim Cook’s most recent comment about cars being another deflection when asked by Andrew Ross Sorkin at the recent Dealbook conference. But Apple did hit a new all-time high last week when Bloomberg reported that Apple’s car plans are accelerating and a debut expected by 2025.', '“Everyone has to pay attention to Apple in autonomous vehicles and EVs if for no other reason than its cash on the balance sheet,” Colas said. “Money doesn’t solve every problem in R&D, but it certainly helps with the ones you know about and so you have to take it seriously if only because they have the resources to do it more than anyone else in the business,” he said.', 'GM and Ford are financially healthy today, generating cash flow from their internal combustion engine operations. “But what happens in the next recession? Or if there is a technological breakthrough in batteries that requires a lot more capital?” Colas wrote in a recent note.', '“In those scenarios, ‘old’ GM and Ford – with a mix of ICE and EV products and a stock valuation to match – are stuck. .. The auto world is nothing if not profoundly capital intensive so this is far from an academic problem.”', 'The flipside of the cash problem, as noted in a recent note on Apple and AVs by Colas, is that investing in autos “has historically been a graveyard for capital.” ', 'But he argues it is too large a market to ignore, and the approach to autos from big technology companies is likely being designed with the expectation of a new economic model focused on “transportation as a service,” not necessarily requiring ownership. “That’s a revenue model any tech company would understand and embrace.”']"

In the meantime, Astra is expanding its headquarters on the San Francisco Bay while the company prepares for its next launch this summer.', 'A SPAC, or special purpose acquisition company, raises capital in an initial public offering and uses the proceeds to buy a private firm and take it public.', 'CNBC toured Astra’s growing facility earlier this month, a visit which was joined by chairman and CEO Chris Kemp and vice president of manufacturing Bryson Gentile.', 'Benjamin Lyon, executive vice president of engineering, along with senior vice president of factory engineering Pablo Gonzalez and vice president of communications Kati Dahm, also attended.', 'The company’s leadership features a variety of backgrounds from the space and tech industries: Kemp from NASA and cloud software provider OpenStack, and Gentile from SpaceX. Meanwhile Lyon came from Apple, Gonzalez from Tesla, and Dahm from electric vehicle maker NIO.', 'Astra’s facility uses infrastructure left over from the U.S. Navy’s former Air Station Alameda. The company first started out with about 30,000 square feet. It’s now expanding into about 250,000 square feet of space – including all the way out to the edge of the bay, where a newly built city ferry terminal connects Alameda to downtown San Francisco, a 10-minute ride away.', 'The main area of the company’s headquarters, about 25% of its footprint, features an open space for much of its rocket development and assembly.', 'Astra has also put all its equipment on wheels, with the company’s leadership emphasizing the flexibility it wants to maintain as it builds out its production capabilities.', 'Its near-term goal is to reach orbit, the next hurdle after its most recent launch broke the barrier to space in December. The next Astra launch is planned for this summer, which will also be the first to generate revenue for the company.', 'Astra’s rocket stands 40 feet tall, and is capable of carrying up to 100 kilograms to low Earth orbit – putting it in the category of small rockets, a category currently led by Rocket Lab.', 'But Astra’s emphasis is on keeping the price of the rocket as low as possible, with pricing as low as $2.5 million per launch. Rocket Lab prices its Electron rocket at about $7 million per launch, but can lift up to 300 kilograms to low Earth orbit.', 'The company emphasized the cost-cutting methods its implemented into its approach, with Astra believing that it’s feasible to get to a production rate of one rocket per day within a few years. The company’s staff compares its rocket to building a small Cessna aircraft.', 'One example of that Astra showed off during the tour was how it builds it fairings – the nosecone of the rocket that protects satellites during launch.', 'The company said the first fairing it used was made of composite carbon fiber, which is typical in the space industry given how light and stiff the material is. But the carbon fiber fairing cost $250,000, necessitating a different solution since the company wants to eventually get the total cost of its rocket down to less than $500,000.', 'Astra chose to build its second fairing out of metal, which it got down to about $130,000. Yet the company needed to go further.', 'Vice president Gentile explained how the company now uses aluminum tubing to give the fairing its strength, combining that with a dozen petals, which are thin, curved pieces of metal. That’s reduced the cost of the fairings to $33,000.', 'Astra plans to get under $10,000 per fairing, by stamping it rather than riveting it together.', 'Another long-term hurdle for the company will be working with regulators to quickly get licenses for launches if it’s able to reach a daily rate. Astra’s leadership said it is working very closely with the Federal Aviation Administration on how to streamline the licensing process, and noted that it wants to have a dozen or more spaceports around the world as well.', 'Astra is also streamlining the operational aspect of its launches, reducing the number of people in its mission control to less than 10 and only needing six people for setting up the rocket at the physical launch site.', 'Its goal is to reduce the number of people in mission control to just two, effectively a pilot and a co-pilot, by automating most of its processes.', 'Its rocket system, including the strongback which lifts the vehicle vertical for a launch, all packs into a few shipping containers.', 'First, Astra rolls a strongback out of the container and into the factory. Then, an overhead crane drops the rocket straight onto the strongback. Finally, the whole system is rolled into a container and then shipped off.', 'Astra has three strongbacks in assembly, with more to come.', 'The former naval facility also features two engine testing areas, with thick reinforced concrete walls.', 'The evening before the CNBC tour Astra conducted testing on the upper stage of a rocket. This made the engine bay a chilly spot to visit, thanks to the below-freezing temperatures of a liquid oxygen tank.', 'During a hot fire test, when one of Astra’s Delphin rocket engines is fired up, the inside of the chambers reaches 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit. Astra representatives said the company can conduct as many as 10 to 15 tests of a rocket’s first stage in a day, or more than 30 upper-stage tests in a day.', 'Astra will continue to expand its current footprint in Alameda, including a lease for a 500-foot pier and plans for an ocean launch platform that it would be able to load up with a rocket in the bay.', 'Kemp told CNBC in February that Astra’s plan for “daily space delivery” is fully funded through 2025, thanks to the SPAC capital.']"
42,Neal Stephenson on his new geoengineering climate change thriller and coining the term ‘metaverse’,2021-11-14T13:45:19+0000,"['Author Neal Stephenson shot to fame almost 30 years ago with the science-fiction novel “Snow Crash,” which envisioned a future dominated by mega-corporations and organized crime, competing for dominance in both the real world and the “metaverse,” a computer-generated world accessible through virtual reality headsets.', 'Since then, he’s written several more novels encompassing technology and history, including a trilogy set at the dawn of the scientific revolution, and has done work for various technology companies including Jeff Bezos’ space travel company, Blue Origin, and augmented reality company Magic Leap.', 'His new novel, “Termination Shock,” out Nov. 16, focuses on the looming issue of our age -- human-generated climate change, projecting a near future of extreme weather and social chaos. Against this setting, a maverick oilman decides to take matters into his own hands and builds the world’s biggest gun to shoot canisters of sulfur dioxide into the air, echoing the effects of a volcanic eruption and temporarily cooling parts of the globe. Geopolitics, social media and Dutch royalty all play a part.', 'Stephenson acknowledges that geoengineering is a radical step, but suggests as the effects of climate change grow more destructive, the demand for radical solutions will grow.', 'But if geoengineering does happen, it probably won’t be because a billionaire took matters into their own hands.', '“In real life, somebody like that would probably get shut down,” he told CNBC in an interview.', '“By far, the more plausible scenario is that some government somewhere just makes the calculation at some point that doing this would be fairly cheap and easy. And better than not doing it, as far as [their] selfish purposes are concerned.”', 'Personally, he favors an all-of-the-above set of solutions to climate change, including more clean energy sources, decarbonizing the economy and carbon capture to take some of the CO2 we’ve emitted over the last 150 years out of the atmosphere. The trouble is convincing large numbers of people that this kind of action is necessary.', 'He points to two factors that he expects will convince more people that climate change can no longer be ignored. One is rising sea levels.', '“You can be as ideological as you want. But you can’t argue with the fact that your house is full of water,” he says.', '“And the other one is these possible so-called wet-bulb events, where some areas become so hot and humid that everyone who’s outdoors will just die.” Stephenson points to the “heat dome” that descended over the Pacific Northwest last summer, causing temperatures to skyrocket for a few days and killing hundreds of people.', 'He does not necessarily believe governments will come together and agree on solutions, although he says the recent 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, or COP 26, was a necessary and useful event. “We have to have those conferences. And we have to hope and pray that their strongest and most optimistic recommendations are put into effect.”', 'But even if they can’t agree, governments will be forced to respond.', '“I think we’ll see the big governments, the Indias and Chinas of the world, charting their own path,” he says. “At the end of the day, most politicians want to retain their power. And they’re going to do what it takes to keep getting votes or to maintain their grip on on the political system. And if they’re seen as having presided over huge apocalyptic disasters and not taking effective action, then they’re in trouble.”', 'Although he was one of the first writers to popularize the idea of virtual reality, he does not necessarily believe that people will retreat into artificial worlds as the real world becomes harder to live in.', '“I don’t hate VR,” he says. “But the reality has been so far that most people don’t like to hang out there for more than a short period of time. That may change as the technology gets better, but there’s just inherent limitations on things like the problem of getting motion sickness, the problem of how do you move around?”', 'He’s more bullish on augmented reality -- the idea pioneered by Magic Leap and currently being developed by Microsoft, Apple, and others, where computer-generated images are blended with the real world. But he agrees it won’t take off until there’s a good reason for people to wear headsets or glasses for long periods of time. “It’ll probably have something to do with making it even smaller, more compact, and less of an intrusive experience to wear around.”', 'As far as the metaverse goes, Stephenson has stood back and watched as the tech and business worlds have claimed the term for themselves, most notably the company formerly known as Facebook, which renamed itself Meta to emphasize its interest in building a computer-generated universe.', '“All I can do is kind of sit back and watch it in amazement,” he said. But, as many have noticed, “There’s a pretty big gap between what Facebook is actually doing, like running Facebook and WhatsApp and Instagram, and the visions that they’re talking about for the metaverse.”', 'Here’s a transcript of the complete interview, lightly edited for clarity and length.', 'Matt Rosoff, CNBC: The plot of your new novel “Termination Shock” is essentially about a maverick businessperson using geoengineering to reverse climate change. For CNBC readers who may not be familiar with the concept of geoengineering, can you tell us a little bit about it?', 'Neal Stephenson, author: The first point to emphasize is that it doesn’t fix the actual problem, which is too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. But it’s thought that it could be a stopgap way to slow down the rate at which the climate gets hotter.', 'And it’s basically imitating the effects of large volcanic eruptions by putting sulfur dioxide or something else into the atmosphere, right?', 'Exactly. There have been many cases throughout history where a big volcano -- most recently, Pinatubo in the Philippines -- does exactly this. And it puts particles or droplets of sulfates into the stratosphere, and those sort of act as a veil that bounces back a little bit of the sun’s radiation back into space so that it never reaches our planet and doesn’t warm us up. So we know that this cools the planet down because it’s happened a bunch of times throughout history. And we also know that the sulfates will kind of naturally wash out of the atmosphere in a couple of years. And you go back to where you were before.', 'So you almost need a constant infusion of them. While you decarbonize.', 'Exactly. The only sane way to use this, if it’s done at all, is as a way to buy time for decarbonization, which is what we really need to do.', 'How did you get interested in this subject and become fascinated with it enough to base a novel on it?', 'I’ve been hearing about the idea for a number of years. I’m interested in history. I’m interested in science and the physics of the planet. And so, the idea that a volcano could erupt somewhere and affect temperatures all over the planet is a natural, fascinating topic for me. Over the last decade or two, it’s become increasingly clear that the CO2 content in the atmosphere is a huge problem, and that it’s getting worse fast, and we’re not really being very effective. Despite efforts by a number of people to draw attention to the problem and and push for emissions reductions, that number is still climbing rather rapidly and probably will keep climbing for a while. So rolling that together in the brain of the science fiction novelist, that looks like the basis for a story that that’s got that technical angle to it, but that’s also got a strong geopolitical and personal storytelling basis.', 'Do you think it’s a realistic likelihood that this could happen in 10 to 15 years? Maybe a maverick individual, but more likely a government that doesn’t particularly care much about world opinion will take it into their own hands?', 'I agree. In this book, it’s the maverick billionaire because it makes for a good story. But I have to do a lot of explaining as to how he’s able to get away with it, because in real life, somebody like that would probably get shut down. By far, the more plausible scenario is that some government somewhere just makes the calculation at some point that doing this would be fairly cheap and easy. And better than not doing it as far as [their] selfish purposes are concerned.', 'It’s considered a pretty radical out-there idea. If you look at the overall landscape and what you’ve been seeing over the last few years, what do you think the likelihood of countries in industry and individuals voluntarily taking steps to reduce emissions enough to keep global warming to a minimum? Or how do you think it’s likely to play out over the next 10 to 15 years?', 'The number that matters is the CO2 in the atmosphere, which is above 400 parts per million and climbing, That’s higher than it’s been in millions of years. So when we talk about emissions reductions, all we’re saying is that the rate at which that number grows, will slow down. But it’s still growing, the numbers still get higher every year. It’s just not climbing as fast because we reduced our emissions. If we could get to zero emissions, which might happen in a few decades -- like China’s saying maybe by 2060, it might get to zero emissions. That just means that that number stays wherever it is, for about a million years, which is how long it takes natural processes to remove it. So emissions reductions are great and zero emissions would be better than than not doing that, but still leaves us stuck with the number at a dangerously high level until we take active measures to remove that carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.', 'What do you think of carbon capture as a technology? Have you followed it at all?', 'I know an increasing number of people who are techies who are altering their careers to think about this and work on this. There’s a bunch of ways that it could be done. We have to do it. It will be the biggest engineering project by far in human history. We have to do it. We have to succeed. And it’ll take many decades.', 'Did you follow the COP26 conference at all? What did you think of it?', 'I followed it. Not super closely. But all of that stuff is great. We have to have those conferences. And we have to hope and pray that their strongest and most optimistic recommendations are put into effect. For sure. It’s just while we’re doing that, we can’t lose sight of what I said before, which is that reducing emissions or taking emissions to zero still doesn’t begin to solve the problem. It just means that we’re not making the problem worse.', 'What about other forms of energy? Nuclear energy in particular is one that draws a lot of interest from from readers. It’s zero carbon, but there’s fear about it, and some of that fear is grounded. What about that and other energy forms? ', 'Nuclear, I think during the Cold War it kind of got rushed into service, too soon. And before the whole picture was was fully understood. So it’s not where where the engineering resources have been going in the last few decades. And with more resources, more engineers, more money, maybe we can find ways to do it that are that are safer. There are still intractable problems around what to do with nuclear waste, and and so on that need attention. But we’re entering into this phase in our history where we have to start thinking in terms of relative risks. If you’re talking about a particular new technology, they have to compare its risk to the risk of not using it. ', 'There’s a lot going on that’s promising. Beyond just nuclear, there’s geothermal and the usual suspects, wind, solar, etc. And we need it all.', 'A lot of these discussions get bogged down by ideological purity tests. So one one side you’ve got activists who say if you even talk about adaptation, that’s wrong. Because you’re giving up on reduction. And if you even talk about carbon capture, you’re just giving the current economy and the current fossil fuel industry more more leeway to keep burning. Then you’ve got other people, the Bjorn Lomborgs of the world, who say, “Oh, we’re focusing way too much on the risks and not talking about the costs enough, and growth is the only way out.” How do you think about this? How do you parse this when you’re looking at all of these different, really strong ideological beliefs?', 'Yeah, a whole separate dimension to the problem that we’re facing is weird, weird polarization of everything. It’s incredibly obstructive. There was just an article in The New York Times about Republicans who are furious at other Republicans who voted for the infrastructure bill. Like, how dare you vote for bridges?', 'It’s really disheartening and seems like it’s definitely this partisan shift by bad actors who think they’re gaining something from it.', 'I personally can look at something like carbon capture, and I can make an argument that convinces me that we should be doing it, so it’s not hard for me to formulate my own opinion on that. Much harder is getting millions and millions of other people to agree.', 'What do you think will be the tipping point? I’ve noticed a lot more people coming around to the idea that we need a multifaceted, throw-everything-at-it solution. And I think some of that comes as the effects become harder and harder to ignore, so it’s harder to presume that this is just happening somewhere else. Do you imagine some kind of event, or series of events, that can break this logjam?', 'So here’s an example. We had this heat dome event in Seattle over the summer, where out of nowhere, from a normal summer’s day, just suddenly, it was 115 degrees. Much hotter than it has ever been in Seattle.', 'I grew up there, and lived there for 10 years as an adult as well. So yeah, that was staggering.', 'So that happened overnight, and after three days of that, overnight, the temperature dropped by 50 degrees. A bunch of people died. So I think an event like that might convince a bunch of people who live in Seattle.', 'But I think one is going to be rising sea levels, which is something you can’t argue with. You can be as ideological as you want. But you can’t argue with the fact that your house is full of water.', 'And the other one is these possible so-called wet-bulb events, where some areas become so hot and humid that everyone who’s outdoors will just die.', 'How can people come together to ensure that solutions help the broadest number of people, rather than pulling up the drawbridges -- let’s just escape into space or our compound in New Zealand or something like that? Or do you think it’s inevitable that the people with the means are going to run?', 'Of course, some people are going to do that. And other parts of the world are going to be depopulated one way or the other. But I think we’ll see the big governments, the Indias and Chinas of the world, charting their own path, going their own way, doing what they think they need to do, in order to basically prevent their their governments from falling. At the end of the day, most politicians want to retain their power. And they’re going to do what it takes to keep getting votes or to maintain their grip on on the political system. And if they’re seen as having presided over huge apocalyptic disasters and not taking effective action, then they’re in trouble.', 'I have to ask about the metaverse, a term that you coined in the book “Snow Crash” in 1992. Now it’s everywhere in tech. It was on Disney’s earnings call! Everybody in the tech world is suddenly using the term, probably not the way you intended it or originally envisioned it. What are your thoughts on that?', 'I have to assume that some of this is pre-emptive. Making sure that one company -- that Facebook -- doesn’t establish a trademarkable position. If they begin to throw the term around, and nobody else does, then they might be able to later prevent other people from from using the term. So that might be part of why they’re doing this.', 'I don’t know. All I can do is kind of sit back and watch it in amazement.', 'There’s a pretty big gap between what Facebook is actually doing, like running Facebook and WhatsApp and Instagram, and the visions that they’re talking about for the metaverse. They’re two very different things. That’s important to keep in mind.', 'I had a conversation with a VC maybe six or seven years ago, and he was sort of a pessimist in general about the course of humanity and where things are going. He said, “Hey, you know, if you’re a pessimist, VR seems like a great bet. Because everybody’s going to want to escape from their real world conditions.” Do you see things that way at all?', 'I’m personally more interested in AR than in VR. I mean, I don’t hate VR. But the reality has been so far that most people don’t like to hang out there for more than a short period of time. That may change as the technology gets better, but there’s just inherent limitations on things like the problem of getting motion sickness, the problem of how do you move around? I mean, while I’m talking to you, I’m just kind of wandering around my house. And that’s a normal human thing to do, to want to get up and move around. That’s a difficult thing to do in a VR environment because you’ll step on your cat.', 'I know you were involved with Magic Leap, and that seems to have gone in a different direction with Peggy Johnson in charge, focusing on enterprise a lot, like Microsoft has, but what’s it going to take for for AR to really take off? What are the technological barriers? I look at how mobile was with Windows Mobile and Palm and some of those things, and then all of a sudden, the iPhone had enough new things in it, the capacitive touch screen and the idea of apps, that it was 18 months ahead of everybody else. And that was enough for it to take off. Is there something like that, that would have to happen for AR to take off?', 'I think that’s a good analogy. Somewhere out there is that tipping point. And nobody knows where it is until they’ve found it. And so timing is tricky. I think what Magic Leap accomplished in the way of hardware is impressive. I mean, they’re shipping a headset with a 6D controller and a whole system that tracks the room around you. And it makes it possible for applications to interact with things that it sees in your environment. And there’s a lot of engineering that has to happen to make those things all work together in a package that doesn’t immediately catch on fire or run out of batteries.', 'I actually saw [former Oculus CTO John] Carmack tweeted, not about Magic Leap, but he was saying maybe what VR headsets need is a big heat exchanger that would sit on top of your head. ', 'So engineering-wise, I think it’s been going pretty well. The question is what will prompt people to want to wear something like this all day long and make it just a routine thing to carry around. And it’ll probably have something to do with making it even smaller, more compact, and less of an intrusive experience to wear around.', 'You’ve been writing about technology for about three decades now. When you look back at when you started this, when the internet was young, what has surprised you and what do you think you’ve been right about? What did you anticipate, and what did you not anticipate?', 'The popularity early on of relatively simple forms of the internet, just simple web browsers with words and pictures, and how catchy that was, how rapidly people adopted it. That was a surprise to me because as a techie, I wanted to have more splashy kinds of technologies like full 3D immersive experiences. Who knew that reading a few words on a webpage and maybe seeing a grainy JPEG would be so transformative?', 'On the not-so-happy side, the speed with which and the completeness with which it was taken over by bad actors. I remember when Obama was elected. People were saying, ‘Well, you know, Obama’s team, they understood the internet, they understood how to use the internet. And Republicans, they’re old. And they don’t get it. So they’ve been left in the dust.’ And then eight years later, not only did they get it, but they got way in a way deeper, and much more kind of cynical way than the Democrats had.', 'I know that there’s an HBO adaptation of “Snow Crash” in the works, maybe coming out this year. I haven’t heard much about it recently, can you talk about that?', 'The reason you haven’t heard about it is because they passed on it in June. So it’s no longer an HBO Max project. It’s reverted to Paramount. And Kennedy/Marshall.', 'Are we going to see it soon?', 'All I can say is stay tuned. A lot of people want it to happen.']"

That compares to a 0.8% jump in November, or a 6.8% gain year-over-year, the highest since 1982.', 'Excluding food and energy, CPI is expected to have risen 0.5% or 5.4% year-over-year, when the Labor Department releases the data Wednesday at 8:30 a.m. ET.', '“Sometime in the next couple of months, we think inflation will have peaked, in December or some time in the first quarter,” said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. “We do expect inflation to slow in 2022. We expect prices to go up more slowly in 2022 than they did in 2021. We don’t have the same stimulus. We expect some weaker spending and supply chain issues are not going to be fully resolved, but we think we have passed the peak in some of those shipping supply chains.”', 'Economists disagree on exactly when inflation will peak, but it’s well past the initial time frame the Federal Reserve had expected to see when it dubbed inflation “transitory” or temporary. The Fed now forecasts three quarter-point interest rate hikes this year to battle inflation.', '“It’s still hot, hot, hot, and it’s important because we’re now where the Fed worries about that 7% number getting baked into wages and getting more entrenched,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. “You’ve got the Fed in panic instead of patient mode, so the risk is overshooting... We’re now in a position of the Fed chasing instead of anticipating. It’s worrisome.”', 'Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell Tuesday told a Senate panel that the central bank will use its tools to mitigate rising prices if it sees more persistent inflation.', '“If we see inflation persisting at high levels longer than expected, then if we have to raise interest more over time, we will,” Powell said. “We will use our tools to get inflation back.”', 'Inflation data has repeatedly surprised to the upside. Economists say there’s a risk for an even faster pace in Wednesday’s report.', '“If it’s hotter than expected, it’s kind of a validation of the path the Fed has already put themselves on,” said Tilley. Besides raising interest rates, Powell said Tuesday that the central bank could begin to shrink its balance sheet this year, another step toward tighter policy.', 'Kevin Cummins, chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets, said the peak in consumer headline inflation could be this month, and he notes the make-up in inflation this year is shifting.', '“Last year, it was all on the goods side. We saw a pick-up in core goods in our forecast. We have it shifting from used cars and commodity prices. Now it’s shifting toward rents which are stickier,” he said. “We have inflation kind of holding in around 3% this year partly because of rent and also broader wage pressures that are building because the labor market is getting as hot as it is.”', 'Cummins expects CPI to be rising at 3% by the end of the year. He said rents have been climbing over the past two years. Rent costs, together with hotel costs and owners’ equivalent rent are the shelter component of the consumer price index and are about 30% of headline CPI, he noted.', 'For 2022, Cummins expects rents to rise 4.5% year-over-year, after rising 3.4% in 2021. In 2020, the pace of rent increases slowed to 1.9% from 3.3% in 2019, he noted.

With Take-Two agreeing to buy Zynga for $3.50 a share in cash and $6.36 a share in stock, Pincus is poised to pocket about $193 million while still owning roughly $350 million worth of Take-Two equity.', 'Take-Two’s purchase price equates to a premium of 64% to Zynga’s closing price on Friday, giving Pincus’s net worth a big boost.', 'Still, this isn’t how the story was supposed to unfold.', 'Prior to its IPO in 2011, Zynga was about the hottest ticket in Silicon Valley. Its flagship game, FarmVille, was printing cash, as consumers spent real money building digital worlds and dressing up their avatars. In the first three quarters of 2011, revenue surged to almost $830 million, up seven-fold from full-year revenue in 2009. FarmVille accounted for 27% of sales.', 'Paul Martino, a venture investor who backed the game developer in its first financing round in 2007 said that, between 2008 and 2011, Zynga got more chatter than any other company in Silicon Valley. In particular, during the financial crisis, venture capitalists weren’t putting money into much of anything, but Zynga was still raising cash.', 'Heading into the IPO, Kleiner Perkins was so bullish on Zynga that in early 2011 it increased its stake by buying shares at $14, valuing the company at $12 billion. The stock debuted below that, at $10, and surpassed $14 a few times in early 2012.', 'But Zynga’s early growth relied entirely on Facebook — the company’s games spread virally by using the social network for distribution. When Facebook started exerting greater control over the platform, it limited third-party developers from promoting their services, exposing Zynga’s principal weakness. Between 2012 and 2014, Zynga’s revenue fell by half.', 'The stock lost 75% of its value in 2012 and never fully recovered.', '“Once it became such a big success out of the gate, there was belief that Zynga could transcend being a game company into being so much more,” said Martino, a managing partner at Bullpen Capital. “But ultimately, it’s a game company and got bought as a game company.”', 'Martino admitted that the stock performance was disappointing. Even with the high premium Take-Two is paying, it’s still less than the IPO price.', '“But if you told us in 2007 that the company would be bought at a $12-$13 billion number, I have to imagine we probably would have been pretty happy about that,” he said.', 'Pincus’s one big stock sale came at the right time, for him, and drew the ire of other investors. In April 2012, as part of a secondary offering, Pincus sold $192 million worth of shares at $12 apiece, representing about 15% of his total stake. Many shareholders were still in post-IPO lockup at the time and didn’t have that option.', 'Pincus and the other insiders who sold in the offering were sued by stockholders, who claimed they “suffered colossal losses on their investments,” while those at the top were able to sell before the drop. Zynga eventually settled for $23 million.', 'From that point until late 2018, Pincus held onto his remaining shares. He sold just about $70 million worth of shares between 2018 and 2021, in part for estate planning for his kids, according to a representative for Pincus. The only other significant change to his ownership was in connection to his 2017 divorce.', 'Holding was a lucrative decision, even as the company faced turmoil and uncertainty.', 'Pincus stepped down as CEO in 2013, when Zynga named Don Mattrick, who had been Microsoft’s Xbox business, as his successor. Pincus stayed on as chairman and assumed the role of chief product officer.', 'Two years after that announcement, Pincus reclaimed the CEO position, a move that was panned by Wall Street — the stock sank 18%. Here’s what Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a report after that announcement:', '“Mr. Pincus has a spotty record with investors, given Zynga’s struggles in the latter portion of his previous stint as CEO; we believe the lack of investor confidence resulted in Zynga shares trading down significantly in after-market trading.”', 'Less than a year after his return, Pincus again gave up the CEO job, this time handing the reins to Frank Gibeau, an executive at Electronic Arts. Pincus remained the chairman.', 'The stock has since climbed 300%, including Monday’s rally on news of the Take-Two deal.', '“One of the toughest challenges for any company is a successful partnership between its founder and CEO,” Pincus wrote, in a blog post after the announcement. “Over these past 6 years I’ve been lucky to have that with Frank Gibeau. He has taught me a lot about managing at scale. Frank and I have always said that we agree 80% of the time, and the other 20% has led to some of our best insights.”', 'Zynga was able to revive itself by moving beyond social games like FarmVille, largely through acquiring the developers of popular titles like Words with Friends, CSR Racing and Toy Blast.', 'But Pincus, who is now a managing partner at investment firm Reinvent Capital, never abandoned his love for the thing that got him started: Poker.', 'Prior to the outbreak of Covid-19, Pincus held Zynga poker nights at his house, setting up several tables of Texas Hold’em and treating his guests to catered food. Martino said he last attended a poker night at Pincus’s house in early 2020.', '“He’s done that for years,” Martino said. “He does a great job.

The sheds are the result of Kroger’s deal with British online grocer Ocado to use technology to quickly fill customers’ e-commerce orders and do that in a more profitable way.', 'One shed is in Monroe, Ohio — close to Kroger’s Cincinnati headquarters — and the other is in Groveland, Florida — a fast-growing city about 30 miles west of Orlando. CNBC had a chance to look inside the facility as it reported on how the grocer is trying to build an online grocery delivery business in Florida, where it has only one store.', 'For Kroger, the sheds are a huge investment. Each one costs a minimum of $55 million to build. It’s a risky bet, especially when one considers it has to share a portion of each sale with Ocado. To pay off for Kroger, its online business must grow rapidly.', 'Here’s a closer look at how Kroger is using its Florida shed to get groceries to customers, based on a tour of the facility and interviews with company leaders:', 'Each shed is stocked with about 31,000 different grocery, personal-care and household items. Trucks pull up to industrial-sized, warehouse doors to unload pallets of cereal, soup, vegetables, packs of paper towels and more. They are ferried by forklift to a decant station.', 'Once there, employees unwrap the pallets and break down the shipping boxes. They scan and sort items of the same type into plastic totes — almost like stocking a giant, high-tech vending machine.', 'Key pieces of information about each tote are typed into a computer, including the number of items it contains and product expiration dates. The automated system uses the data to monitor inventory levels and flag products that are at risk of going bad or falling short of Kroger’s standards. (For instance, Kroger guarantees 10 days of freshness for milk.)', 'Meanwhile, another group of employees load delivery totes with blue plastic bags. These containers will be used to collect items for customer orders.', 'The engine of each shed is a high-tech grid of roughly 200,000 plastic totes. The totes are stacked on top of one another in rows. Some are full of items that haven’t yet been doled out for a customer, such as loose onions, boxes of Pampers diapers or bags of gummy worms. Others are empty. And a third category is filled with bagged groceries picked out for a customer.', 'Totes shuffle around like a game of Tetris. From a bird’s-eye view, the grid — or hive — is about the same size as a football field. It is made up of two sides: a chilled side for perishable items and an ambient side for shelf-stable consumer packaged goods and household items.', 'Totes are color-coded. White totes are “hive totes” that stay in the grid. They get filled and emptied of inventory — but are never used as a delivery receptacle for a customer.', 'Other smaller totes go inside of those “hive totes.” Red totes hold refrigerated and ambient temperature items. Blue totes are used for frozen items.', 'Meat goes into a yellow tote. Fruits and vegetables go in a green one. And anything that could contaminate food items, such as deodorant and laundry detergent, goes into an orange tote.', 'Some groceries get an extra layer of protection. For example, bunches of bananas stay in a cardboard box inside of the tote to minimize the risk they will get squished.', 'All are gobbled up by the grid-based system, which is made up of conveyer belts and chutes.', 'The hive remains active nearly round-the-clock. An overnight shift from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. tends to be the busiest. That’s when employees pick groceries for next-day deliveries. There’s also a day shift from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m. From 5 p.m. to 9 p.m., the grid can be down for any maintenance that’s needed.', 'Behind the scenes, Ocado’s software powers robots in an elaborate choreography. Robots roughly the size of a dishwasher glide on top of the grid of plastic totes. Each has wheels that allow them to go four directions and a metal, tape measure-like ribbon at each of its four corners.', 'Almost like a carnival game, the robots can unwind the metal-like tape, hook onto the tote and snatch it into its belly from multiple yards away.', 'The robots run this intricate storage-and-retrieval system. They move around the totes and come up with best routes to get them to outbound lanes or inbound lanes, so that employees can fill them up with inventory and process customers’ orders.', 'Frozen items are not part of either grid. Instead, they are kept in a large, walk-in freezer that is kept at minus 10 degrees. Employees hand pick pizzas, pints of ice cream, microwavable dinners and more. Those items get put into foam-lined blue totes along with dry ice to keep them cold on the delivery route.', 'In the middle of the hive, employees stand at pick stations. Some work on the ambient side, which is kept at about 70 degrees. Others pick in an area that resembles the inside of a refrigerator at 34 degrees. Here most employees wear heavy coats and winter hats. On the chilled side, the grid is much smaller — eight totes deep versus 21 deep — since each item that goes into a tote has a much shorter shelf life.', 'Employees at pick stations have a conveyer belt next to them that serves up totes full of the items that they need to grab for a customer. They stand in front of a counter area that spits out three different totes at a time to fill with customers’ purchases.', 'Each employee’s computer screen shows which items should go with a customer’s order. A green light also appears above the correct tote and a small screen shows the quantity of the item to add to the bag. They scan items, much like a cashier would at the store.', 'The software that powers the entire grid helps group together similar orders, such as pairing customers who ordered the same kind of ketchup or yogurt. It also tells the system how to pick, so that fragile items like loaves of bread and cartons of eggs are last.', 'When an employee is done filling a batch of totes, they press a button and the containers get gobbled back up by the grid.', 'Along the way, Kroger has multiple checkpoints to catch moldy fruit, leaking milk or other problems that can leave a bad impression — and potentially, scare away customers. One of those is a backroom where employees soak lettuce, store asparagus stems in water, comb through containers of strawberries and do other kinds of quality checks.', 'It also has a team of quality assurance employees who monitor the pick stations and do spot checks. Employees at pick stations are also encouraged to flag any items that don’t look or smell right.', 'When customers’ groceries are done being picked, red and blue totes travel to the end of a conveyer belt to a station for outbound orders. They are spit out in a sequence, so an entire customer order is together — regardless of items’ temperatures. Orders heading to a similar destination are grouped together, too, so they wind up in the same delivery van.', 'The outbound station is on the chilled side of the facility for quality control.', 'Totes are loaded into metal frames on wheels and loaded into the back of a temperature-controlled delivery van. Each van has a refrigerated section and a room temperature section to make sure chocolate doesn’t melt and six-packs of beer arrive cold.

But, starting next year, the shipping industry will have to comply with rules that should dramatically reduce sulfur emissions.', '“It is the biggest change in oil market history,” Steve Sawyer, senior analyst at energy consultant Facts Global Energy, told CNBC.', '“It is going to affect crude oil producers, traders, ship owners, refiners, equity investors, insurance companies, logistical businesses, banks… Who’s left? I’m struggling to think of anyone it might not affect. That’s why it is a huge transition,” Sawyer said.', 'With less than six months to go before the new rules on marine fuels come into force, CNBC takes a look at the far-reaching consequences of the coming changes.', 'On January 1, 2020, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) will enforce new emissions standards designed to significantly curb pollution produced by the world’s ships.', 'Amid a broader push towards cleaner energy markets, the IMO is set to ban shipping vessels using fuel with a sulfur content higher than 0.5%, compared to levels of 3.5% at present.', 'The most commonly used marine fuel is thought to have a sulfur content of around 2.7%.', 'The new regulations are the result of a recommendation that came from a subcommittee at the United Nations (UN) more than a decade ago and was adopted in 2016 by the UN’s IMO, which sets rules for shipping safety, security and pollution.', 'More than 170 countries, including the U.S., have signed on to the fuel change.', 'Starting in 2020, ships found in violation of the new laws risk being impounded and ports in cooperating countries are expected to police visiting vessels.', '“It is an enormous switch. If you considered shipping alongside all of the oil consuming nations, it would be number four or five on the list — so it is an enormous amount of consumption,” Anthony Gurnee, CEO of Ardmore Shipping, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” last week.', 'Ardmore Shipping is a U.S.-listed company based in Ireland, with a business of owning and operating a fleet of tankers that move refined oil products.', '“We are going to a fundamentally different type of fuel. It is having a bigger impact actually on the refining industry than it is on shipping,” Gurnee said.', 'The forthcoming measures are widely expected to create an oversupply of high-sulfur fuel oil while sparking demand for IMO-compliant products — thus ratcheting up the pressure on the refining industry to produce substantially more of the latter.', 'This is especially important, energy analysts say, because Middle Eastern oil producers — such as OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia — are likely to lose out given their over-reliance on crude with a high-sulfur content.', 'The shipping industry is under intense pressure to slash its sulfur emissions, given the pollutant is a component of acid rain, which harms vegetation and wildlife, and contributes to the acidification of the oceans.', 'The proposed rule change comes at a time when the stakes are high for the world’s shipping vessels. Late last year, analysts at UBS estimated the green shipping market could be worth at least $250 billion over the next five years.', 'In a word: no.', 'The IMO has said there can now be no change to the implementation date, as it is too late for any revisions to take place before January 1, 2020.', 'Ship owners can significantly reduce their sulfur emissions by using low-sulfur fuel, traveling more slowly, installing exhaust gas cleaning systems or opting for other — more expensive — clean fuels such as liquefied natural gas.', 'Some ships will chose to limit the air pollutants by installing exhaust gas cleaning systems, known as “scrubbers.” These are designed to remover sulfur oxides from the ship’s engine and boiler exhaust gases.', 'A ship fitted with a scrubber could continue to use heavy oil, since the sulfur oxide emissions would be reduced to a level equivalent to the required limit.', 'Analysts estimate the container industry — which transports consumer goods such as sofas, designer clothes and bananas — is likely to be among those hit the hardest, with additional costs of approximately $10 billion, according to a Reuters report.', 'The world’s two largest container shipping lines, A.P. Moller-Maersk and MSC, have both reportedly said that falling in line with IMO regulations is likely to incur extra costs of roughly $2 billion each.', '“I am a firm believer that the market will find a balance,” Sawyer said.', '“Let me put it this way, there is a brick wall coming at the end of December which has been built for over two years. I think you can either run into it head first and say: ‘that hurts,’ or you can find a way around it.”', '— CNBC’s Patti Domm contributed to this report.']"

55,Facebook Portal Go review: A great portable video calling screen marred by the company’s privacy and trust issues,2021-10-19T14:58:13+0000,"['Facebook’s new Portal video calling devices hit stores and began shipping to customers on Tuesday. I’ve been testing out the new portable Portal Go for the past week.', 'The $199 Portal Go is part of Facebook’s third generation of Portal devices that the company announced last month. Facebook is still pretty green when it comes to putting together hardware products, but the social media company has made strides in its design and execution since releasing its first Portal devices in 2018. Since then, Facebook has also introduced Portal devices that attach to your TV, and mini versions that look like picture frames. The Portal Go is the first of these products that can be moved around and it works without being plugged into a wall.', 'Along with the new Portal+, the Portal Go is Facebook’s first redesign of its video calling device since 2019, and in that time, it shows that Facebook has only gotten better a putting together hardware products.', 'Facebook has never broken out sales figures for its Portal devices, so it’s hard to say how successful these products are. In its financial results, the company includes Portal within its “Other” revenue stream, which also includes its Oculus virtual reality headsets and Workplace enterprise communication software businesses. Since the fourth quarter of 2018 when the first Portal devices were released, Facebook’s Other revenue has grown nearly 223% from $274 million to close to $885 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.', 'Unfortunately, for everything there is to like about the Portal Go — I like the big 10.1-inch screen, the portability and the speakers — the device is made by Facebook, and over the past several years, the social media company has wrecked its trust with its users, lawmakers worldwide and consumers at large. The Portal Go is fantastic for video calling, but do you really want a Facebook-controlled camera in your home?', 'Here’s what you need to know.', 'The Facebook Portal Go is a device designed for video calling that you can easily move around your home, and for that specific task, the Portal Go works perfectly.', 'In my testing of the gadget, I was able to use the Portal Go to call friends and family via Messenger and WhatsApp. The Portal Go would ring if they called me, and I could accept by touching the screen. I could initiate calls by searching for my friends on the device.', 'The Portal Go sits on a charging mount when not in use, but as soon as you have a call to make, you can grab it by the handle notch hidden in its posterior and move it wherever you need to go. At times I chatted with friends while on the move, but often, I would simply take the Portal Go and sit it on my coffee table, my bed or my kitchen counter. Once situated, I was able to enjoy my video call hands-free.', 'I liked that I could use it while relaxing on the couch and then pick it up and continue my call while cooking. Short video calls can be fine on a phone, but anything longer than five minutes is better situated for a dedicated video calling device like the Portal Go.', 'Amazon has the $249.99 Echo Show and Google offers the $229 Nest Hub Max, but none of those devices are portable, forcing you to make your video call in whatever spot where you connected your gadget to an outlet (hopefully you picked somewhere comfortable).', 'Portability might seem like a small difference, but that feature distinguishes the Portal Go.', 'I received a call on the Portal Go while my partner was working in the same room. So I picked up the Portal Go and moved to a different room. We also tried the Portal Go to call my partner’s family during their weekly dinner. They were able to position their Portal Go testing device at the head of their table, making us feel like part of the dinner.', 'With a 10.1-inch screen and an excellent speaker system, the Portal Go makes video calls that are crystal clear in both visuals and sound. You can easily hear whoever you are chatting with whether you’re leaning in during the call or sitting back.', 'As for battery life, we never came close to running out of juice during a call, but Facebook told CNBC that the Portal Go has enough battery to last up to five hours of one-on-one calling via Messenger or 14 hours of listening with its screen off.', 'Like other Portal devices, the Go also includes augmented reality features that can be used to make funny faces, add colorful backgrounds or change up the sound of your voice. These features keep calls interesting and would be especially entertaining for kids.', 'My other favorite use of the Portal Go was uploading pictures onto it to use it as a digital picture frame — pictures look gorgeous on the Portal Go’s display.', 'My biggest complaint about the Portal Go is the fact that it’s made by Facebook.', 'It’s very difficult to trust Facebook with a device that has a camera and microphones in your home.', 'Fortunately, the Portal has a cover that you can slide over its camera whenever it’s not in use, and you can also press a button that will electronically turn off its camera and microphones. But that doesn’t change the fact that Facebook made the device, and time after time, Facebook has violated its users’ trust. Just last month, a whistleblower leaked internal documents that showed the company knew that Instagram is hurting teenagers’ mental health and was doing nothing to alert the public about it.', '“Our track record in the market is ultimately how we’ll build trust,” Facebook’s head of product management for Portal Micah Collins said when asked about the privacy concerns.', 'The Portal would already be a hit if it was made by Samsung, Apple or pretty much any other major hardware tech company. They’re fantastic for what they were designed for. Anyone who is concerned about trusting Facebook with their privacy has every right to feel that way.', 'It’s also missing a lot of features.', 'It doesn’t have Netflix, YouTube, HBO Max or basically any video-streaming service that you would want on a device with a screen as gorgeous as the Portal Go’s. This was also the case with the original Portals that launched in 2018, but it feels like an even more pertinent absence now that the Portal Go is a portable gadget. I’d be more willing to buy it if I could do video calls, have a digital photo frame and watch my favorite shows all for $199. You can, however, watch content on Facebook Watch, if that’s something you ever feel like trying out.', 'Among the few apps worth using on the device are the audio-streaming services, which include Spotify, Pandora and iHeartRadio. I tried out the Spotify app and was quite impressed by the audio quality of the Portal Go. Unfortunately, the Spotify app was extremely disappointing. There’s no search function, so you’re limited to listening to whatever playlists the app recommends to you. It feels like someone developed the Spotify app for the Portal and then forgot about it.', 'The Portal Go is a fantastic video calling device with much-needed portability built-in as its signature feature. I recommend the Portal Go for anyone who makes frequent video calls. If you’re like me and live far away from many of your relatives and loved ones, the Portal Go is fantastic for keeping in touch. And at $199, the Portal Go makes for an excellent gift idea with the holidays coming up.', 'Unfortunately, Facebook’s repeated and frequent trust issues with the public and lawmakers make it incredibly hard to trust the company with a device that relies so heavily on a camera and microphones. If you can bring yourself to trust Facebook with a camera in your living room, the Portal Go is an excellent device. But I don’t blame you if you don’t trust Facebook.']"
56,"The lines between beer, soda and spirits are blurring as beverage companies seek sales growth",2021-12-28T12:00:01+0000,"['Bud Light is adding cola and orange soda to its seltzer, Mountain Dew is moving into the alcohol aisles and Molson Coors has a whiskey brand.', 'In the hunt for growth, beverage companies are experimenting in new categories, blurring the lines between beer, soft drinks and spirits to become powerhouses fighting for consumers’ so-called “share of throat.” But some alcohol companies worry about the potential implications of such a change on the three-tier system, which has kept that industry alive — and legal — for 88 years.', 'In 2020, total beverage alcohol consumption rose 2% — the biggest gain for the industry in nearly two decades, according to IWSR Drinks Market Analysis. Beer was the only category to see declining volume, true to a yearslong trend. Consumers reached for hard seltzer cans or mixed their own cocktails while stuck at home during lockdowns and maintained those habits this year.', '“There are premium dollars going into ready-to-drink canned products in a cooler, and there’s growth again,” said Barclays analyst Lauren Lieberman at Beverage Digest’s “Future Smarts” virtual conference in early December.', 'In response, drink companies are teaming up to benefit from each other’s expertise. For example, Beam Suntory and Boston Beer announced a partnership this summer that would take well-known brands like Truly and Sauza into new categories.', 'For their part, nonalcoholic companies are diversifying their portfolios as soda consumption shrinks and new regulated beverage markets, like CBD-infused drinks, are on the horizon.', '“We’re seeing it not just from beer competitors, we’re seeing it from nonalcoholic competitors — you’ve got Coke with Topo Chico,” said Ann Mukherjee, CEO of Pernod Ricard North America. “The lines are blurring, and consumers are the ones blurring the lines, so it’s allowing a lot more nontraditional companies to come into the space.”', 'Coca-Cola launched Topo Chico Hard Seltzer with Molson Coors Beverage in the U.S. in early 2021 as hard seltzer consumption soared. According to IWSR, U.S. hard seltzer volume surged 130% in 2020, helping the ready-to-drink category overtake spirits consumption, although growth has slowed this year. Topo Chico is the first alcoholic beverage that Coke has sold in the U.S. since the 1980s.', 'Molson Coors has said Topo Chico could become a top-three hard seltzer brand, joining White Claw and Truly at the top. The drink is closing out 2021 with a 2% share of the roughly $4.3 billion U.S. hard seltzer market, despite only being available in roughly a third of states. A nationwide launch is slated for January.', 'In its latest quarter, Molson Coors reported net sales of $2.82 billion, down 2% from the same time in 2017. In the last five years, as beer sales have lagged and the company has begun transforming its portfolio, the stock has fallen 53%. Coca-Cola, on the other hand, has seen its revenue climb 9.9% over the last five years to $10 billion in its latest quarter. The beverage giant’s stock has risen 40% in that time.', 'PepsiCo wasn’t far behind its archrival Coke. In August, it teamed up with Sam Adams brewer Boston Beer to announce Hard Mtn Dew. The flavored malt beverage will contain 5% alcohol by volume and sell on the soda’s brand equity — without the high caffeine content.  ', 'Even before its launch, the drink is controversial. The National Beer Wholesalers Association has raised alarms against the launch, slated for late February. Pepsi has given a license to Boston Beer to produce the drink and created a new company, Blue Cloud, to distribute it.', '“They’re taking an existing product that’s known as a globally recognized soft drink brand and adding alcohol, creating a whole host of challenges as it relates to the regulatory side, but also public health … we’ve never had that before,” said Craig Purser, CEO of the NBWA.', 'One important concern is that soda branding for an alcoholic beverage could result in underage drinking — accidentally or on purpose. Boston Beer said the design of Hard Mtn Dew cans will feature “adult-oriented graphics” and emphasize that the drink contains alcohol as part of its efforts to separate the alcoholic beverage from the soda. The company also said it will restrict its marketing to only target consumers 21 years of age or older.', 'But the NBWA’s main argument centers on Pepsi’s potential impact on the competitive environment and, thus, the three-tier system that has long governed the alcohol industry. After the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, the alcohol industry adopted the three-tier system, which separated manufacturers, distributors and licensed outlets. Alcohol producers are only permitted to sell their products to licensed importers, distributors and control boards, which in turn are only allowed to sell to licensed outlets — like liquor stores and restaurants.', 'The complex system is supposed to ensure a legal and competitive marketplace, while safeguarding against the possibility of a Prohibition redux. Washington is the only jurisdiction where manufacturers can sell alcohol directly to retailers.', '“Having all of these separations is good, it’s fair, and it increases the competitiveness, and it really makes it so a consumer can be targeted properly with exactly what they want to buy,” said Tyler Theile, chief operating officer and director of public policy for consulting firm Anderson Economic Group. “If these lines get blurrier, states will have to get more careful about what falls in what category and where they’re allowed to be sold.”', 'Many states don’t allow large manufacturers to distribute their own products for that reason, although Pepsi is trying to sidestep that by licensing manufacturing to Boston Beer. Unlike Coke, Pepsi owns most of its bottling operations in the U.S., meaning that it has the responsibility of bottling and distributing about three-quarters of all of its North American beverages.', 'Anheuser-Busch InBev, the largest alcohol producer in the U.S., self-distributes in some markets. Purser estimates that accounts for 6% to 8% of Anheuser-Busch’s total volume.', '“If successful, [Pepsi’s] foray into alcohol to capture a wholly new white space opportunity (while ultimately better leveraging its pre-existing and extensive network of distribution assets) could drive meaningful new sources of revenue and profit growth over the next three to five years, while challenging the near oligopolistic beer distribution networks of [AB InBev] and [Molson Coors] as a viable third alternative in beverage alcohol distribution,” wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Steve Powers in a Dec. 12 note to clients.', 'However, Pepsi is entering uncharted regulatory territory as their product lines blur. Many consumer goods companies pay retailers “slotting fees” for more shelf space or premium territory in grocery stores. For alcohol producers and distributors, paying such fees is illegal.  ', '“While PEP will contend that it does not offer ‘slotting fees’ as a rule in the US, any such perceived payments for placement on PEP’s part (whether direct or indirect), or any signs of camouflaging such payments could have significant implications (including fines and/or alcohol license suspension) for PEP and its distributors,” Powers wrote.', 'Powers also said that Pepsi has acquired a small fleet of trucks that will be dedicated to alcohol distribution, at least in the early days, although it will likely move to ship Hard Mtn Dew to retailers down the line using the same trucks that carry its other products like Gatorade and Quaker Oats.', 'Emiliano Di Vincenzo, general manager of Pepsi’s alcohol business unit, said in a statement to CNBC that Blue Cloud has filed applications and has received federal approval to operate as a beer wholesaler in several states. It will distribute alcohol products made by independent brewers, while Hard Mtn Dew will be distributed by Blue Cloud, Pepsi bottlers and independent local beer distributors, according to Di Vincenzo.', 'As Coke and Pepsi move beyond soda, some beverage giants are adding the product to their drink lines. AB InBev announced Dec. 16 that it will launch Bud Light Seltzer Hard Soda in January.', 'Traditional soda has come under fire over the last two decades from health experts who worry about obesity and diabetes. In 2020, consumption of carbonated soft drinks fell 4.7%, according to Beverage Digest’s annual report. Bud Light Seltzer’s take on soda won’t contain any sugar and comes in under 100 calories.', '“Given that a significant amount of seltzer fans also purchase soda, we believe Bud Light Hard Soda is perfect for seltzer and soda fans alike,” said Andy Goeler, vice president of marketing for Bud Light.', 'After an initial pop in sales, beer-branded hard seltzers have seen their growth lag. MKM Partners analyst Bill Kirk wrote in a note to clients that he predicts Bud Light Seltzer and Constellation Brands’ Corona Seltzer will get pulled from the market. Corona Seltzer has reformulated its recipe to rejuvenate sales, while Bud Light Seltzer has focused on introducing seasonal variety packs and new lines.', 'Brewers are also pushing beyond hard seltzer and flavored malt beverages and into spirits. The category has seen consumption climb in recent years, boosted by mezcal and whiskey, while beer has lagged.', 'Molson Coors launched Five Trail Whiskey in September, starting in Colorado and expanding to three more states. It’s another step in the company’s pivot beyond beer, which included dropping “Brewing” from the company name in favor of “Beverage.”', '“The [whiskey] category’s size and growth is hard to ignore,” said David Coors, vice president of Molson Coors’ next-generation beverages unit and great-great-grandson of original brewer Adolph Coors.', 'The whiskey uses Coors malt and Rocky Mountain water, a touch that Coors said gave the spirits brand more credibility.', '“There are always critics out there, and we’ve tried to build the product and the brand as tightly as possible to minimize the critics that have tried to come after it,” he said.', 'And while some distillers might grumble about a beer giant edging into their territory, Coors noted that the two industries have been battling for some time, with spirits companies pushing canned cocktails.', '“It’s as competitive of a landscape that I think anyone’s ever seen,” he said.', 'The alcohol industry is on edge, waiting to see whose products become consumers’ new favorites and whose disappear from shelves after failing to catch on.', '“There’s a lot of new muscle that companies need to learn if they’re going to succeed in this space, and every competitor brings a different set of competencies to the game, but ultimately it’s the consumer who’s going to decide who gets to stay and win,” Pernod Ricard’s Mukherjee said.', 'The partnerships forged to make these new drink products may dissolve at the end of this learning curve, experts say. Goldman Sachs analyst Bonnie Herzog said at the Future Smarts conference that companies are in the learning stage now, trying to understand how to market and distribute their new drinks. In the future, they may push more aggressively into those categories, or choose acquisitions over organic growth.', 'For Coke and Pepsi, the push into alcohol could help the companies’ eventual entry into a newer market with the potential for even greater growth: CBD drinks.', 'CBD, or cannabidiol, is derived from the marijuana plant and some people believe it provides therapeutic relief. It does not include THC, which is what gives cannabis users a high. The Food and Drug Administration currently forbids selling food and drinks with CBD in it, making the beverage industry’s biggest players cautious to try it in the U.S. Upstarts like Recess Sparkling Water and Empress Teas, however, haven’t been as reluctant.', 'Cannabis company Canopy Growth, which is partially owned by Corona brewer Constellation Brands, also launched a line of CBD-infused sparkling waters in the U.S. earlier this year. Meanwhile, through Rockstar Energy, Pepsi debuted a line of hemp-infused drinks in Germany earlier this year.', '“When you consider CBD beverages coming into the market, that’s going to change a lot in the next 10 to 20 years,” Anderson Economic Group’s Thiele said. “Getting themselves into the regulated beverage market with alcohol, that gives them a foot in the door to potentially continue to be in the regulated beverage market with CBD in the future.”']"

None have replied at the time of publication.', 'The Philippines was handed a victory in 2016 when an international tribunal in the Hague dismissed China’s claims in the South China Sea, which contains the world’s busiest shipping lanes. The judges ruled that specific portion of the sea claimed by both countries belonged to the Philippines alone.', 'China rejected the ruling. Duterte downplayed the ruling in hopes of gaining economic concessions from Beijing and said the Philippines is no match against China in a confrontation.', 'With just months left in Duterte’s presidential term, China’s promised infrastructure investments to the Philippines have fallen short of expectations, while tensions between Manila and Beijing are rising again in the South China Sea, according to a December report by think tank International Crisis Group.', '“Many in the Philippines are increasingly sceptical of rapprochement with China if it entails giving up claims to various disputed maritime features,” read the report.', 'The South China Sea, a resource-rich waterway, contributes around 27% of the Philippines’ total fisheries production, said Vergara in the Asia Society Policy Institute report. A group of scientists have reportedly warned that Chinese activities in the disputed waters threaten the fishing industry.', 'Meanwhile, tensions with China have hindered Philippine oil exploration efforts in the sea.', '“This has serious repercussions for the country’s ability to achieve energy security as its main source of natural gas for electricity supply — Malampaya — nears depletion,” Vergara said.', 'Some in the Duterte government have more vocally protested the presence of Chinese vessels in parts of the South China Sea that were internationally recognized as belonging to the Philippines.', 'In May, Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. directed an unusually aggressive tweet at Beijing as the two countries clashed over the South China Sea. Locsin Jr. accused China of straining its “friendship” with the Philippines.

58,What Big Oil’s solar energy projects reveal about its climate strategy,2021-08-15T13:30:01+0000,"['Oil and gas companies are working hard on their messaging in the climate change era. If it’s “code red for humanity” as the UN’s IPCC said last Monday in its latest dire climate report, it’s some sort of “code red” for the fossil fuels industry too, in terms of figuring out how to stay relevant, believable — and for the market, investable — in an era of carbon emissions reduction mandates from governments, regulators and shareholders. ', 'Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub took a stab at it earlier this year, saying fossil fuels aren’t the problem — it’s emissions. It follows that if fossil fuel companies can find ways to eliminate emissions, on a large enough scale, maybe they can convince shareholders and stakeholders that they are moving into the future in more sustainable way.', 'But there are big differences in emissions types and emissions reduction strategies. What oil and gas companies do to reduce emissions in their operations and supply chain are, in the end, a smaller part of the carbon reduction game than reducing what is known as Scope 3 emissions — for example, from the tailpipe of your car. Those Scope 3 emissions, by expert estimates, are responsible for the vast majority of carbon emissions from the energy industry.', 'Companies including ExxonMobil have begun to disclose Scope 3 emissions, but in terms of their efforts to reduce emissions, remain focused on their own operations. What oil and gas companies do to lower operational emissions, the energy used to power drilling and all the way to the trucks going to and from drilling sites, does matter. Though how much it matters is inevitably smaller in the grander scheme of carbon emissions reduction efforts. ', '“The electricity oil and gas companies use is a pretty small contributor to their carbon footprint,” said Chris Archer, head of Americas for Macquarie Capital’s Green Investment Group.', 'Occidental has been a leader in many of the new technology approaches to lowering the emissions profile of the oil and gas business. As Hollub told CNBC earlier this year, “The reality of a net-zero carbon barrel, it is possible, and we are doing things to make it possible. It’s not a goal on a sheet of paper.” ', 'Occidental is working on multiple projects related to carbon sequestration, not just for its operations, but other heavy emitters in the industrial sector. A growing but smaller part of that new technology thinking for oil and gas operations, which is expected to see more development in the future, is solar energy — solar panel arrays spreading out in places like the Permian Basin to help lower the emissions profile of oil and gas operations.', 'Occidental already has a 16 megawatt solar farm in the Permian — the first large-scale solar project to directly power oil and gas operations in Texas — and Hollub told CNBC earlier this year “we will be doing more of that. We believe it will take everything, and we will add more solar over time.” ', 'Solar isn’t a new thing for oil and gas. Chevron had a project powering operations in the Kern oil field of California as far back as 2003, and BP even got into solar panel manufacturing for decades under Sir John Browne’s “Beyond Petroleum” mission (before solar manufacturing became mostly China’s game and most everyone else went bankrupt). ', '“This isn’t a brand new journey,” said Amy Chronis, leader of Deloitte’s US Oil, Gas & Chemicals team in Houston. “But it’s still early days to see broad-based carbon reductions.”', 'Now several of the European and U.S. majors are making major investments in renewable again, including BP and Royal Dutch Shell, and all the big oil and gas companies have at least a few solar power projects, whether they developed them on their own or signed what are known as power purchase agreements with project developers, including ExxonMobil, which has added to its renewable energy portfolio in recent years. ', 'It bought 500 megawatts of wind and solar in 2018 from Danish renewable energy company Orsted, the largest renewable deal ever signed by a U.S. major. Chevron signed its own 500 MW project last summer, with the energy generation to be split between the Permian, Argentina and Kazakhstan.  ', 'A lot of the renewable energy history within solar has been more fits and starts — and lower down the priority list —than consistent application to the business. Though, the pressure is mounting.', 'Benjamin Shattuck, research director for Americas upstream oil and gas at energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie, said most of the companies he follows in the U.S. are still fairly early on in their journey to a carbon reduction model, but as environmental performance and ESG become more mainstream — he said ESG is top of agenda when he talks to oil CEOs lately —and more companies talk about net-zero targets and tie executive compensation to the goals, the situation is rapidly changing. ', '“Oxy is one of the companies helping to lead the conversation, between the Goldsmith solar plant [the 16 MW plant Hollub referenced] and longer-term carbon capture and storage, they are thinking about it from a bold standpoint, which is good to see. Everything points to it picking up and accelerating,” Shattuck said.', 'Places like the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico are well-suited to renewable energy, with lots of land and a regulatory framework favorable to project development, whether oil and gas or renewables, but the economics have to make sense. And increasingly, they do.', 'Archer says these companies can have a much bigger impact on carbon reduction through carbon capture efforts and flaring reduction than by going into renewables for the power. But the Permian Basin is one of the best places in the U.S. to cite solar, with loads of cheap flat land and really good irradiance. “Today, solar, for lots of oil and gas is the economic choice versus diesel generators,” Archer said.', 'That implies solar and wind projects being developed may have been less about a focus on carbon reduction, in his view, than being driven by the power generation being economically competitive. And Archer said given how economic solar has become in places like the Permian, if oil and gas companies were serious about it as a de-carbonization strategy, we might have seen more of it already under development. ', 'No one is suggesting solar is oil’s solution. One or two solar plants, “won’t move the needle,” Shattuck said. But larger power purchase agreements and multiple projects across companies in the sector, isn’t insignificant either, in his view. “More operations need to be powered from renewables, whether they own the projects or are taking renewable generation from the grid,” Shattuck said.', 'It’s a complex process to attempt to make oil and gas drilling operations 100% renewable, from running the drilling rigs to generators and compressors and fracking trucks to get people to and from the field. The energy being used to prepare and drill new wells is greater than for existing wells, and these operations are not stationary either, moving around the Permian from West Texas to New Mexico with electric needs variable. In other words, if you build a solar plant in one area, you can’t just easily pick it up and move it to another where more wells are being focused on. That’s why Shattuck said we may see more oil and gas companies signing power purchase agreements with project developers.', '“In some cases, that alleviates the capital risk,” he said. ', 'But all the diesel that is used today — especially the more remote a drilling site is —does represent a wide range of power replacement opportunities.', 'Because Scope 3 emissions are the vast majority of emissions and the furthest from the oil and gas companies direct control — and maybe active interest in controlling, with ExxonMobil saying that while it will track Scope 3 it is really up to society and consumers to make their own energy choices — renewable energy in the fields is in a sense, the low-hanging fruit. ', '“Electrification of the oil field is important, and solar and wind can play a role, part of a larger puzzle that has to be solved. There isn’t a single solution today, that’s the theme,” Shattuck said. “It needs to be multi-technology for them.”', 'This won’t go over well with those ready to leave the fossil fuels economy behind, because the model is in effect augmenting what oil and gas companies are doing in the oil field rather than representing any full-scale pivot. It’s the emissions are the problem —not fossil fuels — of Hollub.', 'But that low-hanging fruit gives the companies a means to test the market, see how investors and stakeholders react, and going down the road of renewables, because it’s not what they have typically done in the past, is part of the effort that will be put into winning back investors in the years ahead.', '“They need to find out what’s hitting the mark and what isn’t, and if Goldsmith [the Oxy solar project] is resonating well with investors, then maybe they do more,” Shattuck said.', 'Archer worries it is still more about issuing a press release than executing on significant change, and he is skeptical that these projects can change the image of these companies.', '“When was the last time you bought something from Oxy? It’s not like you’re swayed as a consumer,” he said. “Building a 20 MW solar farm and issuing a press release won’t earn you many points. You need a bigger strategy and goals.”', 'But while the consumer at the gas pump may not think in those carbon-neutral barrel terms today, industrial buyers already do. “We have talked to companies producing natural gas and the off taker is a utility and that utility does care about the carbon footprint, about the gas burning in a power plant,” said Kate Hardin, executive director of the Deloitte Research Center for Energy & Industrials. “So maybe it is not as direct as a person, as the end user in retail, but companies buying the oil and gas may care.”', 'And that is exactly what happened in early 2021, when Oxy shipped its first-ever carbon-neutral barrel of oil to India, and issued a press release about it. ', 'There are multiple business cases to make in the future that revolve around more of these deals, if on the margins, and that relate back to the value of more renewable energy generation in the fields. Oil and gas companies need to find new competitive advantages, and even if there is a case where the economics of a solar plant don’t work on their own, decreasing export risk could be another way to make the model productive. ', '“It will be interesting to watch that competition. It’s proof of concept work, really early on,” Shattuck said.', 'That work comes at time when the sector is focused more on capital discipline and budget cuts then spending, making it more difficult for oil and gas companies to pull the trigger on experiments with technology. One of the biggest questions for the future of the oil and gas industry is tied up in the question of how much renewable energy development it pursues — what percentage of the overall spending is earmarked for carbon emissions reduction.  ', '“I don’t think it will be an insignificant amount. If they want to continue to have access to funding and capital they will have to continue with a variety of these technologies and strategies, and we will learn more about what’s most effective,” Shattuck said.', 'The oil and gas companies early work on solar implies they are learning and getting familiar with the technology, and it will stay in the mix, but other initiatives will be more material, in Archer’s view. “Building solar is not their solution. It’s good asset management with economic benefits on their existing assets. But it’s not a rubric through which they de-carbonize. But we will see more of it,” he said. ', 'For a long time, the oil and gas industry could do no right when it came to cutting spending and running operations on a more conservative basis. But in recent years, the industry has been forced by investors to do just that. Now capital discipline is a top priority to stay in favor with investors.', 'Carbon reduction efforts, including renewable energy projects like solar, are a different mode of thinking than deciding on exploration spending, but there’s a similarity: the companies are leapfrogging each other in terms of targets and as technology gets rolled out, it will play a role in the sector players that investors decide on as the likely winners.', '“It would be surprising if the budget line item is low,” Shattuck said.', 'Especially with oil and gas executive compensation packages now much more frequently designed to only go up if carbon emissions go down.']"

They’re shipped in 40 freight containers or four jumbo jets.', 'Several chip companies have seen their stock prices soar after the coronavirus pandemic led to a global chip shortage, but ASML’s share price still has some room to grow, Hogarth told CNBC.', 'He said ASML’s market cap isn’t on the same scale as the likes of Nvidia or TSMC because it’s in Europe, where the market values high-tech firms slightly lower, and because its technology is more behind the scenes.', 'Nvidia is currently valued at $521 billion, while TSMC’s valued at $533 billion.', '“As people look for alpha when investing in this trend of semiconductors being more and more critical to global supply chains, this (ASML) feels like it’s an obvious candidate,” Hogarth said.', 'ASML’s growth will be fueled by certain nation’s desire to onshore chip making and reduce their reliance on other countries. The vast majority of the world’s chips are currently made in Asia.', '“If China is going to build the equivalent of what TSMC has today, or some of the leading American semiconductor companies, they’re going to need to buy a lot of these (EUV) machines,” Hogarth said. “So, the more countries consider this technology part of their key sovereignty, the more machines gets sold.”', 'Last month, ASML said it expects a sales boom over the next decade. It believes annual revenue will hit 24-30 billion euros ($28-$35 billion) by 2025, with gross margins up to between 54% and 56%.

In a note to investors on Sept. 29, analysts at the investment bank said “We remain highly convinced on ASML’s growth potential in the mid-term but  … we struggle to see compelling upside to the shares on a 12-month view.”', 'Hogarth said he thinks the analysts are ignoring the “geopolitical dimension” and not acknowledging how much money nations are spending on building up their sovereignty when it comes to semiconductors.', 'Last year, Benaich and Hogarth predicted that Nvidia’s acquisition of British chip designer Arm would be blocked by regulators. Shortly after they made their prediction, regulators around the world announced a series of probes into the deal, which are still ongoing.', 'This year, they’re also predicting that there will be a “wave of consolidation” in the AI semiconductor industry, with “at least one of Graphcore, Cerebras, SambaNova, Groq, or Mythic being acquired by a large technology company or major semiconductor incumbent.”', 'They also believe Alphabet’s DeepMind artificial intelligence lab will have a “major research breakthrough in physical sciences.”', 'Disclaimer: Nathan Benaich has personal holdings of ASML shares.

Their discussions follow September’s signing of the Abraham Accords, which normalized diplomatic relations between Israel and several Arab states. ', 'With just over four weeks remaining in the role, Brouillette is making a final lap through the region as the Trump era of strong-arm oil diplomacy comes to an end in the U.S. Brouillette will be replaced by Jennifer Granholm, the former governor of Michigan who, unlike her predecessor, is widely seen as a climate hawk. ', 'As Brouillette leaves his post, Gulf leaders are questioning how Joe Biden will engage with the region on issues like Iran. Middle East allies still don’t know how the United States, a primary external foreign policy actor in the region, will guarantee security and stability of supply to key markets in Asia and beyond. ', 'The Middle East holds over half the world’s proven oil reserves, but exporting it through the narrow Strait of Hormuz can often prove difficult. The UAE and Saudi Arabia have long sought to find alternative routes to bypass the Strait, including through pipelines.', 'The Abu Dhabi Crude Oil Pipeline has a capacity of 1.5 million barrels per day and carries the bulk of its production to the UAE port of Fujairah on the Indian Ocean. Saudi Arabia already exports some of its oil using a 745 mile-long pipeline that runs from its key production facilities in the east to the Red Sea port city of Yanbu in the west. A major expansion of its capacity is already underway. ', 'Robin Mills, CEO of Qamar Energy told CNBC there is “no perfect solution” for exports. “Tankers can be vulnerable at certain times, so can pipelines. The point is about having options and having a diversity of routes, about having backup. And that’s really what Saudi Arabia and the UAE and tried to do with those pipelines,” he said. ', '“Pipelines can be vulnerable, but you can also protect them,” Brouillette told CNBC on Wednesday. “If we can move natural gas more easily throughout the region, shipping becomes less of a concern. If we can move crude more easily, shipping becomes less of a concern.”', 'Following the establishment of ties with Israel, the UAE is also reportedly looking to collaborate on the transportation of crude and products between the Persian Gulf and Western markets. The Eilat-Ashkelon pipeline, built by Israel and Iran in the 1960s, has a capacity of 600,000 barrels a day and runs from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean.

61,The new U.S. plan to rival China and end cornering of market in rare earth metals,2021-04-17T13:00:01+0000,"['The United States has made previous attempts to reemerge as a dominant player in a rare earths supply chain that is responsible for some of the most important materials involved in electric vehicle production, battery making, renewable energy systems and technology manufacturing. Under the Biden administration, the effort is receiving renewed focus, with massive investments planned in climate change technology and a hard line being taken on geopolitical rivalries and the national security threat posed by China.', 'In 2019, China was responsible for 80% of rare earths imports, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, although exports fell last year in part due to Covid-19.', 'President Biden’s sweeping $2 trillion infrastructure legislation seeks to remake the power and transportation markets in the U.S. and rebuild the country’s semiconductor industry. It follows Biden signing an executive order in February designed to review gaps in the domestic supply chains for rare earths, medical devices, chips and other key resources, and in March the Department of Energy announcing a $30 million initiative that will tap into researching and securing the U.S. domestic supply chain for rare earths and other important minerals in battery-making such as cobalt and lithium.', '“It’s absolutely correct there is a cornering of the market with lithium and other rare earths,” Biden climate envoy John Kerry recently said at a CNBC Evolve summit on the future of energy innovation. ', 'But efforts in the recent past to rival China in the rare earths market and rebuild a domestic industry have been stymied.', '“It’s technically possible to try and rebuild the entire supply chain because we once had it,” says Jane Nakano, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic International Studies’ Energy Security and Climate Change Program. “It’s not that we’re not experienced, it’s not that we have no idea of what the domestic supply chain may look like,” Nakano said, but she added that business, environmental and political factors may make the effort difficult to achieve, especially over a short-time frame.', 'Success is dependent on whether the U.S. can quickly scale up processing and refining after the mining of the resources, and compete on cost with a magnet-making and processing market that’s heavily dominated by China. Once extracted from mines, rare earths are shipped to separation facilities, where they are separated from other minerals. Then rare earths are individually separated into oxides, metals and finally magnets that are used in everything from missiles to wind turbines, medical devices, power tools, cellphones and motors for hybrid and electric vehicles.', 'Rare earth metals are actually more abundant than their name suggests but extracting, processing and refining are tricky for a myriad of technical and environmental reasons. These 17 elements — which are subdivided into the light rare earths and heavy rare earths subsets based on their atomic weights — exist in natural deposits globally.', 'Heavy rare earths are often harder to source. They include metals like dysprosium and terbium, which play a critical role in defense, technology and electric vehicles. Neodymium and praseodymium are some of the most sought-after light rare earth elements crucial in products such as motors, turbines and medical devices. Demand for them exploded in recent years with the growth of technology and will continue to climb amid the ongoing race to create a large electric vehicle market.  ', 'While China is dominant now, in the decades before the 1980s it was the U.S. that held a majority stake in this metals market. That changed as production growth abroad and mounting environmental pressures at home shifted production overseas and also offered cheaper labor costs. According to one 2018 report from the Department of Defense, China “strategically flooded the global market” with rare earths at cheaper prices to drive out and deter current and future competitors. ', '“If the material specification fits, and the price is a dollar better, then you go for the dollar better,” said Koray Kose, senior director of supply chain research at Gartner. ', 'The three most important materials used in magnets include neodymium, dysprosium and terbium. Terbium is one of the toughest to come by because production, extraction and magnet-making are focused on China. Trade wars and retaliatory tariffs can leave many companies sourcing these crucial materials in limbo, even if they make up just a small portion of a product.', 'Market dynamics can escalate so quickly that companies without a diversified supply chain bid aggressively, materials get scarce and prices go up, Kose said. In 2011, for example, rare earth prices shot up when China restricted exports to maintain supplies for domestic industries, which was the case again during the 2019 trade war.', 'Domestic efforts to extract rare earths are taking place in states including Wyoming, Texas and California, but the recent past provides cautionary tales, such as Molycorp, which reopened the longstanding Mountain Pass mine in California in the early 2000s, only to go bankrupt in 2015. ', 'MP Materials bought the mine and restarted production in 2017. The Las Vegas-headquartered company is vying to restore the domestic rare earths supply chain from mine to magnet, and is hedging its bets on neodymium-praseodymium, with the hope of becoming the lowest-cost producer. ', 'In recent years, the Las Vegas-headquartered company received a myriad of grants and contracts from the Department of Defense and Department of Energy to research and improve domestic capabilities. One of the company’s largest customers is Shenghe Resources, a Chinese company responsible for processing, distributing and refining, which also owns a stake in the company. The connection raised some concerns among DOE scientists, according to Reuters, but government funding has continued for a rare earths separation facility.', 'Shenghe Resources distributes the concentrate produced at Mountain Pass to refiners in Asia, “capabilities that simply do not exist at scale in the West,” according to an MP Materials spokesman.', 'The company plans to reinvest the free cash flow generated from operations into expanding MP’s U.S. capabilities, including a restoration of domestic refining capability at Mountain Pass by next year. Ultimately, the company, which went public last year through a SPAC merger, plans to “restore the full rare earth supply chain” to the U.S., the spokesman said, including refining and separation, and magnet-making by 2025, as the domestic electric vehicle market ramps up production.', '“This is happening and I think it’s happening much much faster than I think anybody had anticipated,” said Ryan Corbett, the company’s chief financial officer. “We can compete and we’re going to continue to do it.”', 'Another key player in the space is Lynas Corporation, one of the largest processors of rare earths outside China. The Australian mining company, which operates a separation facility in Malaysia, recently received $30.4 million in funding from the Pentagon to build a Texas light rare earths processing facility and earned another contract, in partnership with Blue Line Corp., also based in Texas, to build a heavy rare earths separation facility.', 'A Lynas spokeswoman referred to the new facilities in an email to CNBC as an “essential foundation” for renewing downstream metal making and implementing magnet manufacturing into the U.S. She wrote that diversifying outside the Chinese magnetic materials supply chain is important to create competitive markets and meet the growing demand for 21st-century technologies.', 'While companies like Lynas and MP Materials are eager to ramp up the domestic supply chains, extracting rare earths is a difficult process due to a combination of environmental, technical and political factors. Many regions, including the European Union, have an abundance of these resources but lack the expertise that other countries like China have in the processing and magnet production, Nakano said. ', 'The rare earths industry has come under fire for environmental concerns. Many rare earth elements reside among mineral deposits with radioactive materials that can leach into the water table. Mining, processing and disposal can also contribute to ecosystem disruption and release hazardous byproducts into the atmosphere. ', 'Although the U.S. is making strides to advance the rare earths supply chain and develop alternatives to mining rare earths, environmental regulations are often more stringent than inside China. In recent years, Lynas came under scrutiny from activists and the Malaysian government for radioactive waste that it produces as part of its enrichment process. Lynas has said that the low-levels of radioactive waste were not dangerous and the Malaysian government ultimately renewed the license and green-lighted a construction plan for a permanent disposal and waste treatment facility in August 2020.', 'Some companies have proposed extracting rare earths from coal, while others suggest setting up a system for recycling old batteries or disk drives. Suggestions include calls to utilize shipping services like Amazon or USPS to set up a recycling system, but these endeavors can be costly, Nakano says. Recycling of key raw materials used in the EV space is receiving greater investment focus. Some emerging battery recycling leaders include Redwood Materials, a start-up from former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, and Li-Cycle, which recently announced plans to go public through a SPAC-merger.', 'The Ames Laboratory in Iowa is one of the many Department of Energy’s national laboratories working on projects aimed at substituting rare earths or finding new, more eco-friendly methods to recover them. One initiative by researcher Ikenna Nlebedim is a rare-earth magnet recycling process designed to recover rare earth oxides, without the hazardous acids or fumes associated. Scientists are also using the process to recover byproducts like copper and nickel. Another laboratory in Idaho is looking at how potato wastewater can be used as a cheap food source for a bacterium that can assist in recycling rare earths.', '“We already have the magnets here,” says Tom Lograsso, director of DOE’s Critical Materials Institute at Ames. “Why can’t we just retain that and close the circle domestically rather than throwing them in a landfill.”', 'In a recent interview with CNBC following the UAE’s Regional Climate Dialogue, Kerry addressed the president’s $2 trillion infrastructure proposal in relation to rivalry with China. The legislation includes $35 billion for climate research and innovation, $46 billion in renewable energy manufacturing and $174 billion to boost the electric vehicle market. China, which accounts for roughly 30% of carbon dioxide emissions globally, claims it plans to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2060 and outspent the U.S. roughly 2-to-1 on energy transition-related investments in the last decade, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance data. ', '“I think that this is a huge economic opportunity, not just for the United States, with people all around the world,” Kerry said. “This is not about China, this is not a counter to China. This is about China, the United States, India, Russia, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Australia, a bunch of countries that are emitting a pretty sizable amount, the United States and China the most.”  ', 'On April 17, Kerry and his Chinese government counterpart issued a joint statement on climate change cooperation.', 'While the U.S. aims for raw materials self-sufficiency, any drastic move away from China and other Asia-based supply chains would dramatically affect American consumers as domestic demand for batteries and electric vehicles ramps up. The pace of demand growth is expected to rise rapidly over the next few years as sales of electric vehicles are slated to reach 12.2 million in 2025, according to data from IHS Markit.', 'Building a strong U.S. supply chain can increase competition in the market, and the market is becoming more focused on the price impacts of rising demand for EVs across raw materials, which could drive up battery prices by 18% and more than double the cost of commodities like cobalt and lithium, Goldman Sachs analysts noted last month. ', 'To meet rare earths demand without global supply chains, though, would require the U.S. to reach “massive levels of production,” and build out an extraction and production chain that could take up to a decade, Nakano said. The best course, for now, is to work with allies, such as the European Union, to reduce reliance on dominant players like China.', '“Once you achieve that, let’s say ten, twenty years from now, then everyone can start looking at making a truly domestic supply chain,” she said.', '— CNBC’s Natasha Turak contributed to this report.']"

63,"U.S. can get to 100% clean energy with wind, water, solar and zero nuclear, Stanford professor says",2021-12-21T23:00:40+0000,"['A prominent Stanford University professor has outlined a roadmap for the United States to meet its total energy needs using 100% wind, water and solar by 2050.', 'Mark Jacobson, a Stanford professor of civil and environmental engineering and the director of its Atmosphere/Energy Program, has been promoting the idea of all renewable energy as the best way forward for more than a decade. His latest calculations toward this ambitious goal were recently published in the scientific journal Renewable Energy.', 'Transitioning to a clean-energy grid should happen by 2035, the study advises, with at least 80% of that adjustment completed by 2030. For the purposes of Jacobson’s study, his team factored in presumed population growth and efficiency improvements in energy to envision what that would look like in 2050.', 'Jacobson first published a roadmap of renewable energy for all 50 states in 2015.', 'This recent update of that 2015 work has a couple of notable improvements.', 'First, Jacobson and his colleagues had access to more granular data for how much heat will be needed in buildings in every state for the coming two years in 30-second increments. “Before we didn’t have that type of data available,” Jacobson told CNBC.', 'Also, the updated data makes use of battery storage while the first set of calculations he did relied on adding turbines to hydropower plants to meet peak demand, an assumption that turned out to be impractical and without political support for that technology, Jacobson said.', 'In the analysis, Jacobson and his team used battery-storage technology to compensate for the inherent intermittency of solar and wind power generation — those times when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow.', 'The Achilles’ heel of a completely renewable grid, many argue, is that it is not stable enough to be reliable. Blackouts have become a particular concern, notably in Texas this year and during the summer of 2020 in California.', 'That’s where four-hour batteries come in as a way to generate grid stability. “I discovered this all just because I have batteries in my own home,” Jacobson told CNBC. “And I figured, oh, my God, this is so basic. So obvious. I can’t believe nobody has figured this out.”', 'Jacobson said that he observed his batteries stayed charged if they weren’t plugged in when they are off.', 'To get more than four hours of charge, multiple four-hour batteries can be stacked to discharge sequentially. If a battery needs more charge output at one time than the battery can provide, then the batteries need to be used simultaneously, Jacobson told CNBC.', 'With this observation, Jacobson and his colleagues at Stanford produced scenarios showing it is possible to transition to a fully renewable system without any blackouts or batteries with ultra-long-duration battery technology.', 'That’s key because technology for ultra-long-duration batteries that would hold energy for several days have yet to be commercialized. Start-ups like Form Energy are working to bring such batteries to market.', 'Planning, of course, is also key to keeping the grid stable. “Wind is variable, solar is variable,” Jacobson said. “But it turns out, first of all, when you interconnect wind and solar over large areas, which is currently done, you smooth out the supply quite a bit. So it’s because, you know, when the wind is not blowing in one place, it’s usually blowing somewhere else. So over a large region, you have a smoother supply of energy.”', 'Similarly, wind and solar power are complimentary. And hydropower “is perfect backup, because you can turn it on and off instantaneously,” he said.', 'Also, there needs to be changes in pricing structures to motivate customers to do high energy demand activities at off-peak times.', '“Demand response is a very big component of keeping the grid stable,” Jacobson said. “It’s used some today. But a lot of places a lot of states in the US right now, the electricity price is constant all day ... and that’s a problem.”', 'So far, Jacobson and his team have run simulations for the all renewable, four-hour battery roadmaps for six individual states – Alaska, Hawaii, California, Texas, New York and Florida, and the contiguous 48 states taken together. (For the rest of the states, Jacobson has approximate simulations, which are available here.)', 'According to his models, California’s energy mix would include 14.72% on-shore wind energy, 18.28% off-shore wind, 21.86% solar panels on roofs, 34.66% solar panels operated by a utility, 5.32% hydropower, 2.91% geothermal electricity and 0.25% wave energy.', 'Texas would be 37.66 on-shore wind, 14.77% off-shore wind, 20.87% roof solar, 23.85% solar panels operated by a utility, 0.1% hydropower and 0.19% wave energy.', 'Jacobson and his colleagues use three types of models for the calculations.', 'First, they use a spreadsheet model to project business-as-usual energy demand in each sector in each state to 2050 and then to convert the business-as-usual energy demand in 2050 to electricity provided by wind, water and solar.', 'Second, they use a weather model to predict the wind and solar fields in each state every 30 seconds. This weather-prediction model runs on a supercomputer and is written in Fortran computing language.', 'And the third component of his modeling matches the 2050 energy demand with the weather modeling of energy that can be supplied from wind, water and solar every 30 seconds. The third component is also written in Fortran, but this portion of the process can run on virtually any computer.', 'The resulting models use no fossil fuels, carbon capture, direct air capture, bioenergy, blue hydrogen or nuclear power.', 'And in that, Jacobson’s roadmaps are different from many clean-energy proposals, which advocate for using all technologies possible.', '“So we’re trying to eliminate air pollution and global warming, and provide energy security. So those are the three purposes of our studies,” Jacobson told CNBC. And that “is a little different than a lot of studies that only focus on greenhouse gases. So we’re trying to eliminate air pollution as well, and also provides energy security.”', 'Addressing all three issues has been Jacobson’s focus for more than a decade. His first major work in the area was published in 2009 in Scientific American magazine, and four years later he appeared on NBC’s “Late Night with David Letterman” to promote his renewable-only approach. Jacobson and longtime progressive political candidate Bernie Sanders co-authored a clean-energy op-ed in The Guardian in 2017.', 'Jacobson knows that his viewpoint is not the loudest. The promise of next-generation nuclear power plants, for example, has gotten government and private funding of late.', 'Nuclear innovation is “pushed mostly by the industry people, people like Bill Gates, who has a huge investment in small modular reactors,” Jacobson said. “He has a financial interest. And he wants to be known as somebody who tries to help solve the problem.”', 'Gates addressed the criticism that he’s a “technocrat” looking to solve climate change with new innovations, instead of with political legislation supporting technology like wind and solar which already exists, in an interview with Anderson Cooper on CBS’ “60 Minutes” earlier in the year. “I wish all this funding of these companies wasn’t necessary at all. Without innovation, we will not solve climate change. We won’t even come close,” Gates said.', 'Also, the timeline for getting some of these technologies to commercialization is too long to be useful. Gates’ advanced reactor company, TerraPower, announced in November that it has chosen the frontier-era coal town Kemmerer, Wyoming, as the preferred location for its first demonstration reactor, which it aims to build by 2028.', '“Even if it’s seven years, that’s just a demonstration plant,” Jacobson said. “That’s not even close to a commercial plant and on the scale we need.”', 'TerraPower CEO Chris Levesque said the technology, specifically the Natrium nuclear reactor, will make a meaningful difference in combating climate change.', '“The Natrium technology was chosen as the first mover of TerraPower’s technologies because we believe it will be operational in time to offer significant benefit toward the country’s decarbonization goals,” Levesque said in a statement.', 'Winning over clean-energy skeptics afraid of blackouts is a challenge, but Jacobson believes he can convince people to accept that a future like he has modeled is possible.', 'Renewable solutions for long-distance ships and aircraft are not available yet, he said. “But those are on the drawing board. And we know technically it can be done just as those haven’t been commercialized.”', 'Education is a key hurdle, as Jacobson sees it. “I am optimistic. But the thing I find that’s the biggest difficulty is the fact that it is an information issue, because most people are not aware, most people are not aware of what’s possible,” he said.']"

It won’t have the feature that its rival, Amazon Prime, touts: free shipping for every item.', 'Walmart+ members will get unlimited free delivery, discounts of as much as 5 cents a gallon for fuel and access to a Scan & Go app that allows shoppers to skip the checkout line. But they will still have to meet a $35 minimum for each online order to avoid shipping fees, or to qualify for grocery delivery to their door. It will cost $98 a year, or $12.95 a month.', 'Amazon Prime costs $119 a year, or $12.99 a month, and includes free two-day shipping and some same-day shipping, without a minimum. Grocery delivery through Amazon Fresh is free, if customers meet a $35 minimum and are in eligible areas.

', 'She said the program is not an answer to Amazon Prime or any other competitor.', '“We’re not launching Walmart+ with the intent to compete with anything else,” she said. “We’re launching it to meet the needs of our customers, and it really was designed to make their busy lives easier. We think that it offers a comprehensive suite of in-store and online benefits that help people save time and money across a variety of areas.”', 'Walmart is the largest grocer in the country. During the coronavirus pandemic, its sales have surged as customers have bought everything from milk and toilet paper to board games and bikes in its stores and on its website. Its e-commerce sales nearly doubled in the second quarter as customers sought out safe and easy ways to shop, such as shipping packages to their homes or retrieving purchases through curbside pickup.', 'How sustainable this growth will be remains to be seen. Walmart hasn’t provided a financial outlook for the rest of the year. Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs told CNBC that some of the gains came from stimulus spending as customers had extra money in their pocket from the government — something that may or may not happen again.', 'On the earnings conference call, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon acknowledged the buzz around company’s soon-to-debut membership program. He and Marc Lore, who leads the company’s U.S. e-commerce division, were absent from a call with reporters to announce Walmart+’s rollout.', 'The company is juggling another significant business decision. It has teamed up with Microsoft to try to buy the U.S. operations of TikTok from Beijing-based ByteDance. The company has chosen a bidder and could announce a deal as soon as Tuesday, according to people familiar with the situation. ', 'Walmart+ members will get unlimited grocery deliveries to the home without a fee, so long as they spend at least $35. Other customers must pay $7.95 or $9.95 for each delivery, depending on the popularity of the time slot.', 'Walmart tested the concept with Delivery Unlimited, a flat-rate grocery delivery subscription service that cost the same amount. Subscribers of that program will automatically become Walmart+ members.', 'For curbside pickup and online packages, however, Walmart+ members and the rest of the retailer’s customers will have a similar experience. Fees and the speed of deliveries will look no different. Walmart+ members will not get preferential time slots for deliveries, Whiteside said.', 'Although Whiteside hinted at more perks in the future, she said the service’s benefits cut across its website and its stores to “make a really compelling offer.”', 'Walmart will now have to sell customers on the value of the service. It has launched and promoted similar programs and flashy initiatives before, only to pull the plug later. It launched, then scrapped its ShippingPass program, a two-day free shipping service that cost $49 a year. It debuted a text message concierge service Jetblack in New York City, but then shut it down earlier this year. It rolled out Scan & Go, a mobile app that it’s relaunching as part of Walmart+, at Walmart stores about two years ago only to end it a few months later. (The service is still available at subsidiary, Sam’s Club, where it originated.)', 'Still, Whiteside said Walmart has benefited from those programs.', '“The reality is, we tested those, we learned a lot from them, and we’ve applied all of the learnings that we got from all of those programs and others to Walmart+ to make sure we bring a program to market that we believe meets the needs of our customers, that we can stand behind and that we know is robust enough and has the capacity to scale and be here for the long term,” she said.']"

Now, with local stores closed and millions of people social distancing, the web has become — by default — the place we shop.', 'In a tweet last week that went viral, industry newsletter 2PM posted the words, “10 years vs. 8 weeks,” followed by a chart showing that e-commerce penetration climbed to 27% from 16% in just eight weeks of quarantine. That was the same amount of market share growth it achieved over the prior decade.', 'Amazon, unsurprisingly, has been the biggest single beneficiary, focusing on essential household and medical items. Beyond the e-retailing giant, consumers have flocked to the websites of Walmart, Target and Best Buy, which all saw surging online sales in the first quarter at the expense of physical retail. ', 'But there’s a wide swath of smaller sites and niche brands that were built for the internet shopper and are now seeing spikes in their business that they never could have anticipated. One of the leading categories is wine and spirits, which saw a 74% increase in online sales from March 11 through April 21, according to a report earlier this month from Adobe.', 'Empathy Wines, a web-based vintner that ships three, six or 12 bottles at a time and sells subscriptions that include three shipments a year, is reaching daily sales levels now that it normally sees only on Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The company, co-founded two years ago by media entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk, has been able to dial up its digital marketing efforts to reach people who are no longer going to liquor stores.', 'In addition to reasonable prices — bottles sell for $20 — Empathy’s wines can only be purchased online, so for many wine drinkers it’s an entirely new brand. The company’s small marketing team is largely based in New York, but the product is made by a winemaker in California, where all the grapes are sourced.', '“If there was a silver lining to an otherwise terrible situation, it’s that people are, in some cases for the first time ever, shopping for categories in a new way,” said Jonathan Troutman, co-founder and CEO of Empathy. “We built this business with the idea that consumers were increasingly building toward that behavior.”', 'Venture capitalist Kirsten Green is seeing that dynamic play out across her portfolio. Her firm, Forerunner Ventures, is an early investor in eyeglass company Warby Parker, skincare brand Glossier, telehealth company Hims and pet food company The Farmer’s Dog. ', 'Green said these internet-based brands were created to take advantage of the efficiencies of selling online and the preference among a large segment of consumers to avoid malls and high-traffic shopping areas. Additionally, they’re attracting new customers now because people aren’t spending on travel, concerts and plays or expensive meals, nor are they hiring babysitters so they can hit the town.', 'With consumers stuck at home, “it’s not that surprising that they would be spending on personal care, wellness for yourself, fitness and your home,” said Green. “There’s less competition for your dollars because you’re not going on vacation this summer.”', 'That’s not to say that all e-retail is benefiting. Luggage company Away (which is also part of Green’s portfolio) saw sales plunge 90% in the first few weeks after initial stay-in-place orders and furloughed or laid off over half its staff.

', 'Galit said some of these trends are more permanent than others. While the convenience of buying groceries and hygiene-related products online will long outlast the pandemic, categories like toys “will likely flatten out over time, both as consumers have stocked up on what they feel they need, and as the rise in unemployment and falling markets begin to limit discretionary spending,” he said.', 'Even for some digital-first brands, there have been some challenges. Warby Parker, Glossier and hair care provider Madison Reed have all had to close physical stores.

', 'Over the next 30 years, investing $2 trillion to $3.7 trillion globally across several sustainable ocean-based policy interventions would generate a net benefit of $8.2 trillion to $22.8 trillion, according to the report commissioned by the High Level Panel for Sustainable Ocean Economy, a project of 14 world leaders and the United Nations secretary-general’s special envoy for the ocean.', 'The research focuses on investments in four main areas: increasing the production of sustainable protein from the ocean, maintaining mangrove habitats, increasing offshore wind production and decarbonizing international shipping. ', '“When we think about the ocean, we think about the impact of climate change on ecosystems and marine habitats. We think about overfishing [and] ocean pollution,” said Manaswita Konar, lead ocean economist in WRI’s Sustainable Ocean Initiative and a co-author of the report. ', '“But we rarely think about the ocean’s ability to address these challenges and bring about prosperity to the economy,” she said. ', 'Ocean-related industries like offshore wind energy, fishing and shipping comprise roughly 3.5% to 7% of global gross domestic product, a value expected to double by 2030, according to estimates from the WRI. However, the coronavirus pandemic has severely impacted jobs and output from those sectors, and climate change, overfishing and pollution are destroying the ocean’s ability to sustain those sectors.', '“We need to stop thinking about the ocean as just a victim of climate change and start talking more about how ocean-based solutions can help achieve economic recovery post-Covid and build economic resilience into the system,” Konar said. ', 'One solution researchers suggest is investing in ocean-based food production by improving fisheries and the production of ocean aquaculture. ', 'As the global population grows, investing in wild fisheries would help provide healthy diets for people over the next 30 years while replacing carbon emission-intensive land-based proteins like beef and lamb, researchers contended. Every $1 invested in increasing production of sustainably sourced ocean-based protein is estimated to generate $10 in benefits, the report said. ', 'Another solution is investing in mangroves, which are swamp ecosystems typically located in the tropics that connect freshwater and oceanic ecosystems and protect people from sea level rise, hurricanes and flooding. Every $1 invested in mangrove conservation and restoration is estimated to yield a benefit of $3, according to the report. ', '“It is important to protect mangroves as early as possible — early investment is important — to avoid high costs in the future,” said Helen Ding, an environmental economist at the WRI’s Economics Center and a co-author of the report. ', 'Offshore wind farms, which are continuing to expand across the world, are part of a major push to get electricity primarily from renewable sources.', 'While offshore farms generally cost a lot more than power from turbines on land, excitement over offshore wind projects has grown amid climate change fears and advancements in technology have helped lower costs. ', 'Researchers contend that every $1 invested in scaling up global offshore wind production generates a benefit estimated at $2 to $17, depending on the varying cost of production. But the value of the return on investment will likely increase as costs for offshore wind energy generate fall due to improved technology. ', 'Another challenge in the energy sector is international shipping, a major carbon dioxide emitter. The industry accounts for roughly 2.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and the total cost to decarbonize the sector has been estimated at $1.65 trillion by 2050.', 'Researchers say that every $1 invested in decarbonizing global shipping and reducing carbon emissions to net zero is estimated to generate a return of $2 to $5.', '“The returns are going to be significant in terms of the health benefits we’ll get from reducing greenhouse gases,” Konar said of decarbonzing the shipping industry. “These benefits will prolong beyond 2050.” ', 'Across all the investment areas, researchers estimated the value of benefits with assessments like health, environmental and ecological, water usage and economic and social factors. The categories of costs included assessments like costs to businesses, government and households. ', '“We are going through a financial crisis post-Covid, so there will be questions raised about the financial implications of these investments,” Konar said.', '“But we have sustainable development goals and commitments that we need to achieve, and all these interventions will help us achieve those,” she added. “We are preparing for challenges that the world will face in the future.” ']"

All those ventures are looking to compete with the small rocket leader Rocket Lab.', 'Astra’s rocket is advertised as capable of carrying up to 100 kilograms to low Earth orbit, for as little as $2.5 million for a dedicated launch. Kemp expects that price point to drop as Astra accelerates to a weekly launch rate in 2023 and beyond.', '“The plan is fully funded to 2025 to get to daily space delivery,” he said.', 'It’s a formidable goal. “You’re talking about nearly a launch a day,” said Ken Herbert, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity.', '“Is it possible theoretically? Yes. But, in basically four years, is one company going to be able to support that kind of schedule? It’s ambitious – nobody’s ever done it.”', '“It doesn’t mean it’s impossible, but everything’s got to go right, even COVID-19 aside,” said Herbert. “And there are other factors in play – if you have an anomaly with any one of these launches than everything else is going to get [delayed]”', 'Astra became the latest private rocket builder to reach space for the first time in December, after its Rocket 3.2 vehicle launched from Alaska.', 'Although the rocket did not reach orbit on that mission, Astra’s leadership viewed the launch as clearing the final hurdles needed to begin commercial service later this year.', 'Astra’s board of directors includes Kemp, co-founder and chief technology officer Dr. Adam London, Advance executive Nomi Bergman and ACME venture capital partner Scott Stanford.', 'Holicity chairman and CEO Craig McCaw is expected to join the board when the merge is complete.', 'The SPAC merger values the rocket company at a $2.1 billion enterprise value.

Astra aims to triple that rate in 2024, with 165 launches and rockets going up twice a week – when the company also expects to turn cash-flow positive.', 'By 2025, Astra aims to be launching almost daily and cross the billion-dollar revenue mark, forecasting $1.12 billion in launch revenue for that year.', 'But, as Kemp noted above, Astra wants to build more than just rockets.', 'The company is working on a cylindrical, disc-shaped “modular spacecraft” so that customers can integrate satellite sensors and technology demonstrations directly into Astra’s rocket.', '“Rockets are always going to be a cylinder, so [a disc is] the perfect form factor to put inside a cylinder, where you don’t waste any volume in the rocket, and then you can stack them,” Kemp said.', 'The practice of “ridesharing” on launches has become common, as small satellites hitch a ride on big rockets to get into space for lower prices. But Kemp says it’s a “nightmare” for those small satellites, as “they all get dumped off in the same place.”', '“That’s the current state of the industry, and it sucks,” he said. “It’s like putting a FedEx truck on a plane and flying it to New York and then driving it back to Los Angeles, and then driving the truck off a cliff.”', 'Instead, Kemp says Astra’s modular spacecraft will allow the company to drop off individual satellites in specific orbits on the same launch.', 'Astra forecast its modular spacecraft business will begin generating revenue in 2022, which it expects will climb to more than $300 million a year by 2025.', 'The other differentiator Astra has from other small rocket builders is minimal and mobile infrastructure required for launches, which Kemp says will become a money-maker as a spaceport service.', '“Our entire system packs into four shipping containers, which we can put on a C-130 Hercules [aircraft], on a truck, on a ship – and we’ve done all of those things already,” Kemp said.', 'Astra’s launch infrastructure requires five employees to unpack, who Kemp says can then prepare the rocket to launch in less than a week.', 'For the Rocket 3.2 launch in December, Kemp noted that one of the five employees Astra had sent to Kodiak, Alaska tested positive for COVID-19. The company quarantined the original team in hotel rooms, chartered a plane and flew up five more people to launch the rocket.', '“All I need is a license from the FAA, we put a fence around a gravel pad, and we launch from there in five days with five people,” Kemp said.', 'The company plans to add spaceports all around the country, Kemp noted, and even in other countries that are U.S. allies.', '“There are 80 space agencies and 75 of them have no way to get to space,” Kemp said.', 'Subscribe to CNBC PRO for exclusive insights and analysis, and live business day programming from around the world.']"

Cremata is hoping Skagway will see 100,000 passengers this year; in 2019 they had 1.1 million. The border to Canada remains closed to non-essential traffic, and the ferries, part of the Alaska Marine Highway System, are plagued by budget cuts.', '“Just getting your family down to go see a dentist or doctor, when that becomes burdensome or overly expensive, there’s a point where people have just had it and move away,” Cremata said.', 'Multiply Skagway’s situation by thousands of communities and more than 700,000 Alaskans, and you can begin to understand why The Last Frontier finds itself in last place in CNBC’s 2021 America’s Top States for Business rankings.', 'It is the sixth bottom-state finish for Alaska in 14 years. The state previously achieved the dubious distinction in the first four years of the study between 2007 and 2010, hitting bottom again in 2018.', 'As difficult as the past year has been in this state and across the country, it presented opportunities that Alaska failed to capitalize on.', 'Alaska met the pandemic with the best-funded public health system in the nation, according to the United Health Foundation, spending $289 per person per year. That is more than three times the national average. Earlier this year, the state was setting the pace for Covid-19 vaccinations, even in its most remote regions.', 'As the national economy struggled to regain its footing, Alaska offered a generally business-friendly regulatory climate — its legal system tilts toward business, and the number of state laws and regulations is manageable. The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation ranks Alaska’s tax climate the third-best in the country.', 'In Skagway, Mayor Cremata said state and federal officials have been extremely helpful through the crisis.', '“They are always ready and willing not only to engage us as a community, but individual people and business owners in the community.

In a word: cost.', 'Cost of Doing Business carries the most weight in this year’s study. As the recovery builds, states are touting low business costs more than any other factor, according to CNBC’s analysis. Alaska is an extremely expensive place to do business.', 'Even Alaska’s competitive tax climate, which earns points for relatively low property taxes and no personal income tax, includes a top corporate tax rate of 9.4%, among the highest in the country.', 'Utility costs are oppressive. Alaskans paid an average of 20.20 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity last year, according to U.S. Department of Energy data, with even higher rates in remote areas. That was second only to Hawaii, and nearly double the national average. Wages are high thanks to the high cost of living, and office and industrial space — which are in short supply — is pricey.', 'Cremata said he is worried about how the price of everything seems to be creeping higher.', '“Everything’s barged in,” he said. “And so, if the cost of fuel goes up, it affects the rates on the barge and that affects the price of your milk and eggs.”', 'Indeed, even that high rate of public health funding may be deceiving, because health care in Alaska is so expensive.

That is more than twice the cost in Phoenix, Arizona.', 'Meanwhile, Alaska’s Covid-19 vaccination rate, once the envy of the nation, has fallen below the national average, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.', 'In March, Alaska became the first state in the nation to make vaccines available to everyone aged 16 and older. Officials theorize that meant those who wanted to be vaccinated were quick to get their shots, leaving vaccine-hesitant residents — many in rural or remote areas — who have proven difficult to convince.', 'Vaccination rates are a metric in the Top States’ Life, Health and Inclusion category, where Alaska finishes No. 19 this year.', 'In addition to its cost issues, Alaska ranks No. 49 in the Top States’ Infrastructure category, above only Maine.

It will allow multiple stakeholders — such as logistics players, shippers and buyers — to share valuable information like real-time cargo locations. The information is said to be encrypted and transmitted, without being stored.', 'The initiative is expected to stamp out significant inefficiencies around the movement of goods along the supply chain. For example, logistics and shipping companies would be able to optimize cargo handling and operations.', '“From the pilots so far, SGTraDex has the potential to unlock more than $150 million of value annually for the supply chain ecosystem,” Heng said.

The company, which provides fulfillment services to online retailers, has more than doubled its warehouse count since mid-2020 to 24 locations today, including four outside the U.S., with plans to reach 35 by the end of 2021.', 'The seven-year-old company is a microcosm of the U.S. commercial real estate market. While office vacancies have soared as employers prepare for a post-Covid future of distributed work, the industrial market is hotter than ever because of a pandemic-fueled surge in e-commerce and increased consumer demand to get more products at Amazon-like speeds.', 'Vacancy rates in industrial buildings are near a record low and new warehouses can’t get built quickly enough to meet the needs of clothing makers, furniture sellers and home appliance manufacturers. Real estate firm CBRE said in its first-quarter report on the industrial and logistics market that almost 100 million square feet of space was absorbed in the period, the third-highest amount ever, and that a record 376 million square feet is under construction.', 'Rents rose 7.1% in the quarter from the same period a year earlier to an all-time high of $8.44 per square foot, CBRE said. The firm wrote in a follow-up report last month that prices in coastal markets near population centers and inland port hubs are soaring by double-digit percentages. In Northern New Jersey, average base rent for industrial properties jumped 33% in May from a year earlier, and California’s Inland Empire saw an increase of 24%, followed by Philadelphia at 20%.', '“The need to have facilities in these markets, coupled with record low vacancy rates, has often led to bidding wars among occupiers that are driving up rental rates,” CBRE said.', 'The wheels were well in motion before Covid-19 hit the U.S. in early 2020. Amazon was already turning next-day delivery into the default option for Prime members, and big box stores like Best Buy and Walmart were racing to add fulfillment space to try and keep pace.', 'The pandemic accelerated everything. Consumers were stuck at home and ordering more stuff, while physical stores had to go digital to stay afloat.', 'Grocery delivery added to the market tightness, as Instacart and Postmates were suddenly inundated with orders from customers who didn’t want to enter a Costco, Albertsons or Kroger store. Instacart is now planning a network of fulfillment centers loaded up with cereal-picking robots, according to Bloomberg, and Target has bolstered same-day fulfillment through so-called sortation centers.', 'In addition to the rapid change in consumer behavior, the pandemic also exposed the fragility of the global supply chain. With facilities in China and elsewhere shuttered, stores experienced dramatic shortages of apparel, car parts and packaging materials.', 'Retailers responded by securing more storage space to mitigate the impact of future shocks, said James Koman, CEO of ElmTree Funds, a private equity firm focused on commercial real estate.', '“The reshoring of manufacturing is gaining momentum,” Koman said. Companies are “bringing more products onshore and need to have room for their products so we don’t fall into another situation like we’re in right now.”', 'All of those factors are contributing to skyrocketing prices, he said. Additionally, construction costs are higher because of inflation and supply constraints, and companies are building more sophisticated facilities, filled with robots.', '“You have these automatic forklifts, conveyor belts, and automated storage retrieval systems,” Koman said. “All this is where the world is going.”', 'Betting on a long-term need for fulfillment and logistics facilities, ElmTree has acquired about $2 billion worth of industrial space over the past seven months, outpacing prior years, Koman said. He estimates the U.S. will need an additional 135-150 million square feet annually to support e-commerce growth.', 'For ShipBob, the e-commerce boom has played right into its business model. But competition for space is simultaneously forcing the company to reckon with higher costs.', 'ShipBob works with brands like perfume company Dossier, powdered energy drink maker Juspy and Tom Brady’s sports and fitness brand TB12, providing a wide network of fulfillment centers for fast and reliable shipping and software to manage deliveries and inventory.', 'Unlike the retail giants, ShipBob doesn’t go after large football field-sized fulfillment centers, and only has leases at a few of its facilities. Rather, it looks for warehouses that are typically family-owned with 75,000-100,000 square feet and some unused capacity. It then outfits them with ShipBob technology and pays based on order volume and the amount of space it uses.', 'While ShipBob isn’t signing leases, it is competing for space in warehouses that are now sitting on much more valuable property than they were a year ago. ShipBob CEO Dhruv Saxena said that his company has to be in areas like Southern California and Louisville, Kentucky, a major transportation and logistics hub, despite the rapid increase in prices.', '“We have to find ways of placing inventory closer to the end customer even if it comes at a lower margin for us,” Saxena said in an interview late last month after his company raised $200 million at a valuation topping $1 billion.', 'ShipBob competes directly with a number of fulfillment outsourcing start-ups, including ShipMonk, Deliverr and Shippo. Those four companies have raised almost $900 million combined in the past year.', 'Saxena said a major reason smaller retailers turn to ShipBob is to avoid the costs and hassle of finding fulfillment space and hiring the requisite workers. He likened it to companies outsourcing their computing and data storage needs to Amazon Web Services and paying for how much capacity they use rather than leasing their own data centers.', '“The same math applies,” Saxena said. “I can open a warehouse, hire people and rig the software or I can convert those fixed costs into variable costs where I pay on a transaction basis.”', 'Nate Faust is in the very early stages of building Olive, an e-commerce start-up that’s working with brands to offer more sustainable packaging and delivery options by using recycled boxing materials and bundling items.', 'Olive opened its first two 30,000 square foot warehouses last year, one in New Jersey and the other in Southern California. Faust, who previously co-founded Jet.com and then worked at Walmart after the acquisition, said if he were entering those leases today, they’d easily be 10% to 15% higher.', 'Olive isn’t actively in the market for more fulfillment centers and doesn’t face a lease renewal until February, but Faust said start-ups have to be opportunistic. He’s working with real estate firm JLL, which he said is constantly on the prowl for attractive space.', '“We have them looking all the time because industrial space is so tight right now,” Faust said. “If we find something perfect for what we’re looking for, it’s not unreasonable to have overlapping leases.”', 'Vik Chawla, a partner at venture firm Fifth Wall, which invests in property technologies, said the challenges in the real estate market are driving more emerging brands and sellers to the outsourcing model.', '“It’s very difficult as a single e-commerce business to try to secure attractive space and run your business,” Chawla said. “The line of people trying to get into industrial buildings is out the door.”', 'Many tenants occupying that line are traditional big third-party logistics providers (3PLs), like C.H. Robinson and XPO Logistics as well as UPS and FedEx. At the top end of the market, Amazon, Walmart and Target are mopping up space to speed distribution and, in Amazon’s case, to manage fulfillment for its massive marketplace of third-party sellers.', 'Prologis, the largest U.S. owner of industrial real estate, said in a May report that utilization rates, which indicate how much space is being used, reached close to 85%. Vacancy rates are at 4.7%, close to a record low, the company said.', 'Amazon is the real estate firm’s biggest customer, occupying 22 million square feet, followed by Home Depot at 9 million and then FedEx and UPS, according to Prologis’ latest annual report. Walmart is seventh.', 'In April, an analyst on Prologis’ earnings call asked what types of clients were most actively pursuing leases.', '“E-commerce is a big component of it, but it’s certainly not all about Amazon,” Michael Curless, Prologis’ chief customer officer, said in response. “Certainly, they’re the most active customer. But we’re seeing a lot of activity from the Targets, the Walmarts, Home Depots, and lots of evidence of the Chinese players making their way to the U.S. and Europe as well.”', 'WATCH: EY on how Covid has boosted digitalization in the retail industry']"

The strategy involves avoiding wholesale channels, such as department stores, to forge stronger relationships with customers. DTC companies have few or no brick-and-mortar locations.', 'Dozens — if not hundreds — of brands have debuted and labeled themselves in the DTC category in recent years. Products range from makeup and pajamas to toothbrushes and deodorants.', 'As Warby Parker and Allbirds prepare to make their respective public market debuts, they’ve entered a fresh expansion phase with aggressive goals. Investors and analysts will hold them accountable.', 'The success of their next moves, including the planned rollout of more physical stores, will likely carry implications for the brands following in their footsteps.', 'For one, both businesses lose money. It’s unclear when — if ever — they’ll become profitable.

In the latter, shares are not taken public by a team of underwriters.', 'An online-only model is only sustainable for so long, experts say. The success or failure of these companies’ public debuts could fuel additional IPOs or lead retail companies that have followed a DTC model to look to other exit strategies.', '“There was this early euphoria that there was a new model where you didn’t need stores anymore,” said Jason Goldberg, chief commerce strategy officer at advertising firm Publicis. “Like stores and the traditional business model was all old school, and the new way of doing things was going directly to the consumer ... slapping up a website and inventing a cool product.”', 'Companies are figuring out the model is not sustainable, Goldberg said.', '“There’s a certain phase of your infant growth where you can achieve success without stores, and it can be really easy to acquire customers,” he said. “But no digitally native brand has achieved a billion dollars in annual revenue without a store. You need those stores as a cost-effective customer acquisition channel at some point.”', 'Emory University assistant marketing professor Dan McCarthy keeps tabs on companies such as Casper Sleep, Figs, Revolve and Peloton as he monitors Warby Parker and Allbirds.

It has also since opened more than 70 of its own stores. It’s further evidence of a company initially fueled by web sales seeing the benefits of real estate.', 'Allbirds, the sustainable shoe brand that got its start in Silicon Valley, said it has “just scratched the surface” of its potential to open stores, particularly in the United States.', 'The company counted 27 retail locations globally as of June 30, according to an SEC filing.', '“As our store fleet expands, we expect our growth to accelerate, as compared to 2020,” Allbirds said. “We believe our new stores will also be highly profitable, have attractive payback periods, serve as good capital investments, and be positioned well to take advantage of physical retail’s recovery from the pandemic.”', 'The company said e-commerce accounted for 89% of total sales last year, and stores made up the rest.

In the three months after the store’s debut in March 2019, web traffic in the area rose 15%. The company saw 83% more new customers in the neighborhood.', 'To leverage the benefits of stores, companies may not need to target expensive markets like New York City or Los Angeles.

Now, I just think we flip that equation, and the initial driver is building the presence online.”', 'For the likes of Warby Parker and Allbirds, the benefits of opening up more stores come with higher fixed costs and the liability of a lease.', 'But many businesses have found ways to manage those costs.

Strategic decisions Katz’s made in the years preceding the coronavirus crisis have helped keep it afloat, too, he said.', 'Dell’s comments came as limited indoor dining at New York City restaurants was set to resume after Gov. Andrew Cuomo paused it indefinitely in mid-December. Some health experts have questioned the timing, citing new coronavirus variants that are believed to be more transmissible.

The deli will revert to the health protocols it used during the fall when the city permitted indoor dining, he said.', 'Dell acknowledged Katz’s is fortunate because its dining room size makes 25% capacity more sustainable than it is for smaller restaurants. From a business standpoint, it’s hard for most eateries to get by with only a quarter of tables being available, Dell said.', '“One thing that we focused on really hard was our website and focusing on bringing the customer experience to your door, the true Katz’s experience.

If enough people have 5G phones, consumer demand could spur carriers to accelerate their 5G network buildout plans.', 'Qualcomm predicted last month that 200 million phones with 5G would ship to retailers in 2020. A separate estimate from J.P. Morgan analysts this week estimated 229 million in 2020, going up to 462 million in 2021.', 'Designing a chip is hard — among top smartphone makers, only Apple, Samsung and Huawei design their own chipsets for high-performance devices, and Samsung still uses Qualcomm chips for some of its top-end phones. Instead, most smartphone makers tend to build mid-range and high-end devices around a Qualcomm processor and Google’s Android operating system, giving brands the ability to focus on marketing and software tweaks. Last year, phones from LG, Xiaomi, Oppo, Nokia, Google and Samsung, among other companies, used Qualcomm processors.', 'While other companies make competing “system-on-chip” products for phones, Qualcomm is dominant, with 40% of revenue in the market, according to research from Strategy Analytics.', 'That means hardware features supported by these chips will become selling points for phones throughout the year, and could trickle down into budget-priced chips launched later by Qualcomm.', 'Chips used to be judged by their CPU speed and number of cores, but most of the improvements on this year’s Snapdragon chips come through a new process in which specialized tasks that are repeated over and over are given their own custom “block” on the chip.', 'Kressin said this approach is how chip performance has increased in recent years given a slowdown in the advancement of transistor manufacturing technology that fueled Moore’s Law, the concept that says chip performance doubles roughly every two years.', 'He cited cores for audio, video, camera and computer vision in Qualcomm’s latest chips.', 'One key hardware feature in this year’s chips is improved specialized hardware called Hexagon for artificial intelligence applications. Instead of having the CPU handle every task, it can offload specific AI problems to a “block” of silicon specially designed to calculate only these kind of problems, Kressin said.', 'For consumers, this means better pictures.', '“A lot of use cases are related to camera, enhancing your pictures, object recognition, blurring the background, automatic portrait mode, this sort of thing,” Kressin said.', 'Qualcomm isn’t the only company integrating specialized machine learning hardware into phones. Apple designs and builds its own phone processors, which have an integrated AI processing component called the “neural engine.” Nvidia, Intel and a number of start-ups are also building similar AI chips for servers.', '“The silicon vendors such as Qualcomm are now moving towards moving what we call a neural network accelerator into those devices,” said Simon Bryant, director of research at Futuresource. “Basically, that allows all that clever stuff they do with machine learning where they train the algorithms, what comes out of that algorithm is what’s called a neural network, that is then placed on the device and run on that chip.”', 'Qualcomm said it expects the 765 and 865 chips to ship to smartphone makers nearly simultaneously and said many companies are already planning to use the chips, with announcements starting in early January.', 'Follow @CNBCtech on Twitter for the latest tech industry news.']"

As it turns out, the industries make for compatible bedfellows.', 'Just take Hayden Griffin Haby III, an oilman turned bitcoiner. The Texas native and father of three has spent 14 years in oil and gas, and he epitomizes what this monthly meetup is all about. ', 'Haby started as a surface landman where he brokered land contracts, and later, ran his own oil company. But for the last nine months, he’s exclusively been in the business of mining bitcoin.', 'As Haby describes it, he was “orange pilled” in November 2020 – a term used to describe the process of convincing a fiat-minded person that they are missing out by not investing in bitcoin. A month later, he co-founded Limpia Creek Technologies, which powers bitcoin mining rigs with flared, vented, and stranded natural gas assets.', '“When I heard that you could make this much money per MCF (a metric used to measure natural gas), instead of just burning it up into the atmosphere, thanks to the whole ‘bitcoin mining thing,’ I couldn’t look away,” Haby said. “You can’t unsee that.”', 'When China kicked out all its crypto miners this spring – an exodus which Haby calls the “Chexit” – that poured kerosene on the flames. “This is an opportunity we didn’t think was coming,” he said.', 'Haby tells CNBC they are already seeing demand rushing to Texas, and he is convinced that the state is poised to capture most of the Chinese hashrate looking for a new home on friendlier shores.', 'Bitcoin miners care most about finding cheap sources of electricity, so Texas – with its crypto-friendly politicians, deregulated power grid, and crucially, abundance of inexpensive power sources – is a virtually perfect fit. The union becomes even more harmonious when miners connect their rigs to otherwise stranded energy, like natural gas going to waste on oil fields across Texas.', '“This is Texas, boys. We got what you need, so come on down,” said Haby. “We are sitting on the energy capital of the world.”', '“I think Kevin Costner said it best: ‘If you build it, they will come,’” said Haby.', 'Parker Lewis is one of Texas’ de facto bitcoin ambassadors. Everyone knows him. Everyone likes him. And virtually any bitcoiner you ask refers to him as the future mayor of Austin.', 'Lewis is an executive at Unchained Capital, a bitcoin-native financial services firm. He isn’t in politics – yet — but he is hustling across the state of Texas to spread the good word on the world’s biggest cryptocurrency. In May, the Houston Bitcoin Meetup consisted of only 20 people in a fluorescent-lit conference room in an office. Then Lewis decided to get involved.', '“I just knew Houston would be prime to explode because of the energy connection to mining – if we organized a good meetup,” Lewis told CNBC. “It’s also key to Texas being the bitcoin capital of the world.”', 'His efforts are paying off. Wednesday’s meetup drew more than 200 attendees from across the state of Texas, as well as California, Colorado, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, New York, Australia and the UK.', 'The buzz was electric on Wednesday night. You had to shout to be heard. And no one in the room mentioned any cryptocurrency beside bitcoin. There was also an unmistakable air of stealth – and FOMO. The people who showed up to this event did so, at least in part, because they didn’t want to get left behind.', 'Capturing excess and otherwise wasted natural gas from drilling sites and then using that energy to mine bitcoin is still firmly in the category of avant-garde tech.', 'Haby, who’s affable and an open book on most things, clams up when it comes to sharing the location of his company’s mining sites. “West Texas” is as much as Haby would give CNBC, though if the name “Limpia Creek” is any indication, that would place them 100 miles due north of Big Bend National Park.', 'His secrecy was par for the course that evening.', 'Bitcoin miner Alejandro de la Torre was born in Spain, but he’s spent years minting bitcoin all over the world, most recently in China. When Beijing cracked down on all things crypto, De La Torre got a call from his boss at 3 A.M. telling him he had to go to Texas. He was in Austin the next day. ', 'Since then, he’s been shipping his new-generation mining gear to the U.S. in bulk. ', '“It’s all through ships and from the Pacific side,” De La Torre told CNBC. “The port depends on the location of where the rigs will end up.” ', 'That was as much as De La Torre would divulge, because, as he explains it, any further details about the destination, or the gear itself, could give his competitors an edge.', 'Bitcoin believers care a lot about privacy, as do the oil and gas guys. Some cited non-disclosure agreements as a reason to speak to CNBC in vague platitudes about business deals. Others were only willing to share their thoughts on the condition of anonymity. And some attendees worried about their job security should their employer find out they were there.', 'These weren’t tycoons -- they were mostly up-and-coming young execs, hungry to get ahead and make a name by taking a gamble on bitcoin mining.', 'For years, oil and gas companies have struggled with the problem of what to do when they accidentally hit a natural gas formation while drilling for oil. Whereas oil can easily be trucked out to a remote destination, gas delivery requires a pipeline.  ', 'If a drilling site is right next door to a pipeline, they chuck the gas in and take whatever cash the buyer on the other end is willing to pay that day. “There’s no choice. There’s no middle finger. Whatever gas comes out that day has to be sold,” explained Haby.', 'But if it’s 20 miles from a pipeline, things start to get more complicated. ', 'More often than not, the gas well won’t be big enough to warrant the time and expense of building an entirely new pipeline. If a driller can’t immediately find a way to sell the stash of natural gas, most look to dispose of it on site.', 'One method is to vent it, which releases methane directly into the air – a poor choice for the environment, as its greenhouse effects are shown to be much stronger than carbon dioxide. A more environmentally friendly option is to flare it, which means actually lighting the gas on fire. ', '“Chemistry is amazing,” explained Adam Ortolf, who heads up business development in the U.S. for Upstream Data, a company that manufactures and supplies portable mining solutions for oil and gas facilities. ', '“When CH4, or methane, combusts, the only exhaust is CO2 and H2O vapor. That’s literally the same thing that comes out of my mouth when I exhale,” continued Ortolf.', 'But Ortolf points out, flares are only 75 to 90% efficient. “Even with a flare, some of the methane is being vented without being combusted,” he said.', 'This is when on-site bitcoin mining can prove to be especially impactful.', 'When the methane is run into an engine or generator, 100% of the methane is combusted and none of it leaks or vents into the air, according to Ortolf. ', '“But nobody will run it through a generator unless they can make money, because generators cost money to acquire and maintain,” he said. “So unless it’s economically sustainable, producers won’t internally combust the gas.”', 'Bitcoin makes it economically sustainable for oil and gas companies to combust their methane rather than externally combust it with a flare. ', '“There is no such thing as stranded gas anymore,” said Haby.', 'But Ortolf has taken years to convince people that parking a trailer full of ASICs on an oil and gas field is a smart and financially sound idea.', '“In 2018, I got laughed out of the room when I talked about mining bitcoin on flared gas,” said Ortolf. “The concept of bringing hydrocarbons to market without a counterparty was laughable.”', 'Fast forward three years, and business at Upstream, a company founded by lead engineer Steve Barbour, is booming. It now works with 140 bitcoin mines across North America.', '“This is the best gift the oil and gas industry could’ve gotten,” said Ortolf. “They were leaving a lot of hydrocarbons on the table, but now, they’re no longer limited by geography to sell energy.” ', 'It is also helping to curtail the overall carbon footprint of some of these oil and gas sites. Recent production stats show that in the U.S. alone about 1.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas is wasted on a daily basis. And these are just the reported numbers, so the actual figures are likely higher.', 'Meanwhile, bitcoin miners get what they want most: cheap electricity. ', 'The thing about all these grand visions for bitcoin mining – to stay the course, it requires some manpower on Capitol Hill to safeguard its plan to scale. And right now, politicians in Washington are scrambling to figure out what and how to regulate cryptocurrencies and all the ancillary services that make up the wider ecosystem for digital currencies. ', 'That’s why another big topic of conversation at the Houston Bitcoin Meeting was political activism.', '“Who knows a staffer or a representative?” one member of the crowd posed to the group. At least half a dozen people raised their hands and one stepped up to confirm they would reach out to their contact in Senator Cruz’s office.', 'There was a sense of momentum in the audience. Several people made the point that the bitcoin contingent across the country had paralyzed a $1 trillion rubber-stamped, bipartisan bill, no small feat for a voting bloc which hitherto hadn’t been viewed as much of a threat on the Hill.', 'But it’s not just about being on the defensive for these tens of millions of voters and bitcoin faithful. They’re going on the offensive by working to install like-minded people into office so that they can do something “before they do it to us,” as one member of the audience said to the group. They’re also teaching veteran lawmakers about bitcoin, as many representatives don’t understand it.', '“We need to target anyone who is anti-bitcoin. There are 45 million of us in America, and we are not silent,” said this same attendee.']"

They’re known as drop-in fuels since they can be used with existing infrastructure. In other words, electrofuels could be used to power the engines of today’s trucks, ships and planes.', 'The Sacramento-based company announced its first founding round on Tuesday, led by AP Ventures, which is a London-based venture capital firm focused on hydrogen and its role in decarbonization. In addition to Amazon, other backers include Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and the Grantham Environmental Trust, founded by legendary investor Jeremy Grantham.', 'Infinium is targeting areas of the transportation sector that have proved difficult to decarbonize, including long-haul trucking, aviation and shipping. When it comes to planes, for example, lithium-ion batteries are not a great alternative given their cost and weight, while fuel cells would require heavy investment to retrofit planes and the entire infrastructure that supports fueling.', 'But roughly one quarter of global emissions come from the transportation sector, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, meaning it’s a vital part of the decarbonization story.', 'Infinium uses renewable power for electrolysis — the process of splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen — to produce what’s known as green hydrogen. The hydrogen is then combined with carbon dioxide that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere, and put through Infinium’s proprietary reactor.', 'The ultimate output is a net zero carbon fuel that can be used to power jets and trucks, among other things.', 'Green hydrogen is key for electrofuels to be environmentally friendly. It’s not new technology, but it’s prohibitively high cost has traditionally stood in the way of its gaining widespread traction. One of the ways Infinium plans to lower costs is to build its plants at or near renewable power sources — in remote locations, for instance — where production is cheap, but where transmission to market might be difficult.', 'While biofuels and green diesel are already on the market, Infinium CEO Robert Schuetzle said his company’s fuels are a new class given their lower carbon intensity.', 'Infinium currently has 10 projects under development around the world, and Schuetzle expects the first electrofuels to hit the market by late 2023 or early 2024.', '“This is a platform that is ready for commercial,” Schuetzle said. “Based on the economics of low cost renewable power electrolyzer costs coming down in the green hydrogen space, and the addition of Infinium’s commercial ready technology platform, this will be a major area of focus for the transportation sector in coming years.”', 'The company’s launch comes as corporations — including airlines — are increasingly outlining ambitious decarbonization goals, amid pressure from investors and the public more broadly.', 'Of course, bringing any new technology or product to market is difficult. Schuetzle said that while Infinium is new, it builds on more than 10 years from technology development at Greyrock Energy, which he also founded and which focused on converting natural gas to liquid form.', '“With Infinium, we see real potential to help decarbonize heavier forms of transportation, including air and freight, as well as heavy trucks,” Kara Hurst, Vice President of Worldwide Sustainability at Amazon, said in a statement.', 'Infinium did not disclose how much money it raised in its initial funding round.

Other retailers, like Macy’s and Kohl’s, have raised prices to keep up with the uptick in costs.    ', 'But resale companies The RealReal and ThredUp are playing up their secondhand supply chains, inventory levels, and pricing.   ', '“While many retailers have been forced to raise prices due to inflation or supply chain pressure, we do not have the same level of exposure,” James Reinhart, CEO of ThredUp, said on the company’s recent third quarter earnings call.  ', 'ThredUp’s business is entirely sourced domestically from its users, according to Reinhart, and has no reliance on direct manufacturing for inventory.  ', '“We have chosen to strategically lower prices in order to engage as many customers as possible during a time when consumers are feeling price pressure in many other parts of their life,” he added.  ', 'ThredUp’s prices averaged 15% lower in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. Reinhart said the company will continue to keep prices down through ThredUp’s domestic supply system.

ThredUp’s stock has been volatile since its initial IPO pop this year, and after its recent earnings resulted in a one-day bounce, shares continued on a declining trajectory. RealReal received a boost from its recent earnings, but remains down near-25% this year.', 'But the broader consumer trends supporting the secondhand market do continue to serve as a secular tailwind for the niche.', 'In total, by 2023, the secondhand and resale market is expected to reach $53 billion, according to the latest annual forecast from ThredUp, with $27 billion in resale and $26 billion in traditional secondhand (thrift and donation).', 'Carolyn Thompson, president and CEO of Aravenda, a consignment software company, noted that the resale industry is growing 11 times faster than traditional retail, citing ThredUp data.

94,Why Nvidia is spending $40 billion on Arm,2020-09-15T10:00:01+0000,"['Nvidia’s planned purchase of buy Arm from SoftBank for $40 billion would be the largest semiconductor deal of all time by dollar value if it is completed. ', 'But the dollar value may actually understate the importance of the deal, announced Sunday. ', 'Arm is at the heart of nearly every smartphone sold today, from Apple iPhones to Samsung Galaxy devices running Google’s Android software. In addition to smartphone processors, Arm technology is used in lots of smaller chips integrated into all kinds of computer systems and devices. Arm said that more than 180 billion chips with its processor cores and other components have been shipped around the world. ', '“They’re in everything, and they power computers of all different types of shapes from the fastest supercomputer in the world, to smart watches and smart thermostats,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC on Monday. ', 'But for Nvidia, Arm represents a chance to boost its fast-growing business of selling chipsets and software to data centers, the massive networks of computers that power large companies and cloud computing networks.', 'In particular, investors believe that Nvidia could closely integrate Arm’s CPU technology with Nvidia’s specialty in graphics processors (GPU) to build a lead on the rest of the semiconductor industry. ', 'Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis said in a note Monday that the deal could let Nvidia bolster its data center business by creating an “ecosystem” of server chips and software ranging from Arm-based CPUs to its GPUs. Nvidia could more closely integrate Arm processors into its products, increasing performance without using additional power.', 'It could also entrench Nvidia and make it harder for competitors to steal business. ', '“With Arm, we think Nvidia is poised to also offer general purpose, heterogeneous data center scale solutions and ultimately capture up to 80% of the value of the serial processing part of the data center ecosystem,” Lipacis wrote. “We also think that Arm gives it a larger moat in the data center.”', 'Nvidia’s shares, already up more than 110% this year, rose more than 5% on Monday and were up 3% in Tuesday’s premarket, suggesting investors have a lot to like from the deal.', 'Both Arm and Nvidia are silicon-focused companies, but they deal with different areas of the semiconductor industry. Huang says Arm and Nvidia are “complementary.” ', 'Arm, based in Cambridge, England, sells the blueprint that other companies need to make low-power chips for devices like smartphones, tablets, virtual reality headsets and smart speakers. It’s called an instruction set. Some customers, like Apple, license Arm’s architecture and design their own CPU cores. Others, like Qualcomm or Samsung, license entire processor designs from Arm. ', 'Arm makes money by selling intellectual property licenses, software, and tools to the chip designers that want to use its technology, taking a royalty on every chip that uses its technology. The company generated revenue of more than $1.7 billion in 2019.', 'Arm was founded in 1990 as part of a joint venture that included Apple, which wanted to use low-power Arm technology in a portable computer called the Newton.', 'But Arm ascended to the forefront of the industry over 15 years later with the help of the smartphone boom. Smartphones needed chips that used significantly less power than the x86-based laptop and desktop chips made by Intel — they wouldn’t have as much computing power as a laptop, but at least their battery would last for more than a few hours. The first iPhone had an underpowered Samsung processor with an ARM processing core.', 'Since then, chips with Arm-based cores have become the standard for Apple and Android phones and have become significantly more powerful, even challenging power-hungry desktop or laptop chips in performance for some tasks. Qualcomm’s chips, used in Samsung, Google, and Huawei phones, use Arm cores. ', 'Arm is also making inroads into other types of computers beyond smartphones. Apple is planning to shift its Mac laptops and desktops to in-house chips using Arm technology. Microsoft has spent a lot of time and money adapting Windows to run on Arm chips, too. And Arm chips are increasingly being used in data centers, where their low power draw can be an advantage.', 'When Softbank bought Arm in 2016 it also emphasized potential in the “internet of things,” or the trend that an increasing number of things, such as machinery or cars, could be equipped with internet connectivity and a cheap microprocessor — running on Arm technology, of course.', 'Nvidia, led by co-founder Huang, was originally best known for designing chips that would enable central processors to offload 3D graphics work to increase power and efficiency. Its customers were gamers, companies building gaming systems, and people who needed power to build 3D graphics. ', 'Games are still a big part of Nvidia’s business. But in the past decade, Nvidia has started to expand into a number of different categories.', 'In 2008, Nvidia started building its own “system-on-a-chip” (SoC) hardware under the Tegra brand, combining its graphics processors along with Arm processor cores in one product. A Tegra chip is at the heart of the Nintendo Switch console, for example, although the product line has not gained as much traction among smartphone makers as Qualcomm’s Snapdragon. Nvidia’s self-driving car platform includes hardware chips with Arm cores. It now builds chips and software for self-driving cars and robots.', 'But the biggest tailwind at Nvidia’s back in recent years was the rise of artificial intelligence. Researchers found that graphics processors — Nvidia’s speciality — were well adapted to run power-hungry artificial intelligence algorithms more efficiently than older server chips or simple CPUs.', 'As Nvidia’s ambitions have swelled, so have the company’s fortunes. At the start of trading on Monday it was valued over $322 billion, a startling rise from five years ago when it was worth about $12.3 billion, according to FactSet data. In its fiscal 2020, which ended on Jan. 26, Nvidia reported $10.92 billion in revenue, down 7% from $11.72 billion a year earlier. ', 'Some analysts see the deal as primarily a boost to Nvidia’s data center business, the company’s fastest-growing unit. In the quarter ending in June, it reported $1.75 billion in data center revenue, or about 45% of the company’s sales, surpassing its gaming unit for the first time. Data center sales were up 167% on a year-over-year basis. ', 'Here’s how Huang described the data center vision on Monday: “If you think about all the chips that have been shipped, 22 billion chips that were shipped last year, we know very well going forward that AI will be infused into them.” ', 'Nvidia sees an opportunity to sell its AI chips and graphics chips to Arm’s customers, too. “If we could leverage their business model, if we could stand on the network they’ve created and take the technology we’ve invented and put it into that channel and make it available to their thousands of partners, the economics for us would be incredible,” Huang said. ', 'But many of those Arm customers compete with Nvidia, including Samsung, Qualcomm, Broadcom and Texas Instruments.', 'These companies may balk at being sold additional technology from a competitor. Nvidia says it will continue to operate Arm as an independent subsidiary with a “customer neutral” and “open-licensing” model — basically, if companies can pay for it, they can obtain a license, even if they’re direct competitors with Nvidia.', 'Huang said Monday that Arm CEO Simon Segars had already spoken to many of its customers to answer their questions about the deal. ', '“They want to know they can continue to rely on Arm. The fact that we’re announcing the deal today suggests that the conversations went fine. Although nobody likes change, if they realize we’re committed to the business model, we’re committed to openness and fairness, and more than that, we want to keep everything the same, plus we want to add our IP to it, so they can have more to purchase and more value we can deliver to them,” Huang said. ', 'Correction: An earlier summary misstated terms of Nvidia’s deal with Arm.']"

', 'The deserted Safer FSO tanker, which is believed to contain approximately 1.14 million barrels of oil, has been anchored and left without maintenance off the Yemeni coast of Al Hudaydah since early 2015, according to the UN. ', 'The tanker, which was described in a recent op-ed from The Atlantic Council as a “floating bomb,” is thought to be eroding fast. ', 'There are concerns that following years of inertia in a salty and corrosive maritime environment, volatile gases have built up in the storage tanks — increasing the risk of an explosion. ', 'However, UN officials’ plans to inspect the ship in order to assess the scale of the damage has repeatedly been blocked. ', 'Matt Lowcock, the UN undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs, said in a speech to the Security Council last week that Houthi authorities “continue to delay” any assessment of the tanker. ', 'Lowcock pointed out that this was “additionally frustrating” because Houthi authorities had actually contacted the UN in early 2018 requesting assistance with the tanker and promising to facilitate their work. ', '“If the tanker ruptures or explodes, we could see the coastline polluted all along the Red Sea. Depending on the time of year and water currents, the spill could reach from Bab el Mandeb to the Suez Canal — and potentially as far as the Strait of Hormuz,” Lowcock said on July 17. ', '“I leave it to you to imagine the effect of such a disaster on the environment, shipping lanes and the global economy.” ', 'Experts have warned that brinkmanship between the Saudi-backed UN Yemen government and the Houthis over the Safer FSO vessel “is threatening a serious environmental emergency.” ', 'The two sides blame each other for failing to reach a solution about what to do with the decaying oil tanker. ', 'The value of crude estimated to be stuck on board the Safer FSO tanker is reportedly worth more than $70 million, based on current oil prices.', 'International benchmark Brent crude traded at $64.02 Wednesday morning, up over 0.3%, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) stood at $57.09, around 0.6% higher.', ' ', 'The Yemen-owned vessel was once an offshore platform for ships landing crude oil from a nearby pipeline to the central province of Marib. It is supposed to be constantly tended to in order to prevent the build-up of explosive gases.', ' “The danger increases with every day that goes by,” Doug Weir, policy director of the Conflict and Environment Observatory, told CNBC via telephone on Wednesday. ', '“No-one is really sure of the condition the ship is in at the moment.” Weir said, before adding: “This shouldn’t necessarily be a super-politicized issue.” ', '“In theory, this could be a brilliant example of where we see co-operation between all the Red Sea countries coming together to tackle an environmental issue. Instead, we are seeing the opposite of that.”', 'Tweet 1', 'Earlier this month, the recognized Yemen government sounded the alarm in a video posted on Twitter, saying there is an “urgent need” to empty the tank and perform maintenance works. ', 'In the video, the Saudi-backed UN government warned the explosion of the Safer FSO vessel would constitute an environmental disaster that is four times greater than the Exxon Valez oil spill in 1989 — generally viewed as one of the worst man-made environmental disasters in history. ', 'The UN’s Lowcock warned the Security Council that if a major spill does occur, “the world will surely demand answers from anyone who could have prevented the catastrophe but chose not to.”']"

98,Dry ice sales booming as hospitals get ready to store Pfizer’s Covid vaccine at minus 94 degrees,2020-12-09T22:19:00+0000,"['The ultra-cold temperatures required for storing the Covid-19 vaccine developed by U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and Germany-based BioNTech has driven a buying frenzy for freezers and dry ice. However, large-scale freezers units are expensive — and with hospital budgets already strained during the pandemic, dry ice has emerged as the go-to option.', 'That’s how Chris Vida, owner of Dry Ice Depot, described what he’s seeing right now.', 'Vida’s business — located in Bridgewater, New Jersey — ships on average 40,000 to 50,000 pounds of dry ice per day. He told CNBC that new orders continue to pour in from hospitals that will have to store their Pfizer vaccine supplies at minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit. ”[Tuesday] was a big day, we moved around 70,000 pounds of dry ice. So our inventory is a little shot. We’ve ramped up double our normal volume at this point.”', 'The average dry ice order amount from hospitals is 170 pounds, Vida said, adding that he’s also receiving big orders from pharmacies and shipping giants like FedEx.', 'Distributors and suppliers across the nation are dealing with a similar situation in preparation of the vaccine receiving emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration. Limited approval could be given this week after the agency’s vaccines committee meets Thursday.', 'Acme Dry Ice in Boston, one of the largest distributors of dry ice in the nation, told CNBC that it’s team plans to work over the holidays to ensure he can fulfill the new orders that are coming in. “There is no sleep for the vaccine or the Covid virus,” said Marc Savenor, president of Acme Dry Ice.', 'Unlike the ice in your home refrigerator, dry ice is a solid form of carbon dioxide, or CO2. Back in March, fewer cars on the road due to the pandemic contributed to a decline in ethanol production, which produces CO2 as a by-product, resulting in a shortage of the gas. Experts said that driving ultimately returned over the summer and CO2 supplies, in turn, have rebounded.', 'Rich Gottwald, president of the Compressed Gas Association, told CNBC the industry is confident there’s enough CO2 product to meet demand for the vaccine. CGA is a trade body representing the biggest CO2 suppliers and dry ice manufacturers. “The shortage that we saw in the spring was really alleviated by the end of the day, by driving coming back over the summer. [Companies] are ready to supply dry ice as soon as the vaccine comes available,” he added.', 'The industrial and chemical companies involved in the production of CO2 and dry ice are not the most high-profile names. Airgas, part of Air Liquide, supplies dry ice. Continental Carbonic, part of Matheson, is another supplier. Germany’s Linde acquired U.S. based Praxair in 2018 for more than $80 billion. Linde, along with Air Products, supply CO2, which is then converted into dry ice by their customers.', 'One of the key challenges with dry ice is that, unlike toilet paper, it can’t stockpiled.', '“Over time dry ice will revert back to its gaseous form, whether that be five, seven, 10 days, it certainly has a lifespan,” Gottwald explained. “At that point, if it’s being used for a vaccine, the product would need to be re-iced .. more ice would be needed to be applied to the vaccine to keep it at that temperature.”', 'It’s one of the key reasons hospitals are looking to set up longstanding contracts with Vida at Dry Ice Depot in New Jersey: To ensure they can come back for refills when they run out. Vida said that one of the hospitals he’s supplying dry ice to is St. Barnabas Hospital in The Bronx in New York City.', 'While hospitals figure out how many vaccines doses they will be allotted, the staff is puzzled over how much dry ice they will need to keep the Pfizer vaccine at the proper temperature. “Now all the questions are starting and, you know, there’s a lot of confusion out there.

However, the analyst’s bullish thesis remains very much intact.', 'In line with his optimistic approach, Wong kept a Buy rating on the website building and hosting company. Although he trimmed the price target from $70 to $60, this still leaves room for a 40% gain over the next year.', 'Digging deeper into the print, Squarespace posted revenue and billings of $196 million (a 31% year-over-year increase) and $206 million (a 24% year-over-year gain), respectively. Both results beat the Street’s $189 million and $200 million calls. Additionally, Presence and Commerce revenue surpassed Wong’s estimates. It should also be noted that most of the increase in take rate came from Tock’s contribution, which Squarespace acquired earlier this year.', '“Management also highlighted better cash retention this year, which should stave off concerns that pandemic subscription cohorts could see elevated churn as economies normalize,” the analyst added.', 'That being said, Wong believes the “flattish Q3 trajectory likely to disappoint investors.” For the full year, the company actually bumped up its revenue outlook by $6 million at the midpoint from a range of $764 million to $776 million to a range of $772 million to $780 million.', '“We believe the increase would have been just ‘good enough’ in a vacuum. However, we expect investors to scrutinize the Q3 revenue outlook guide ($193-198 million, 19-22%), which projects for a modest sequential decline at the mid-point and falls ~$2 million below consensus estimates ($197.5 million). Management emphasized a prudent approach to outlook due to the uncertain macro and health climate. Investors we caught up with were understanding of the volatile demand environment, but felt the lack of specificity around which business segments and KPIs magnified the confusion,” Wong explained.', 'Long-term, though, Wong is standing in the bull camp. “We remain positive on SQSP’s long-term opportunity to enable digital commerce… We expect a more thoughtful growth roadmap at the company’s inaugural Analyst Day in November. Following the noisy outlook, we expect investors to home in on the commentary around revenue mix shift, additional monetization/take rate opportunities, details surrounding the Tock acquisition and integration and other potential long-term growth accelerators,” he commented.       ', 'Currently, Wong is tracking a 68% success rate and 27.1% average return per rating.', 'Following The Trade Desk’s second-quarter earnings call, Needham’s Laura Martin tells investors that there are “several upside value drivers we’ve underestimated, until now.”', 'In accordance with her optimistic stance, the five-star analyst reiterated a Buy rating on the media-buying platform provider. Additionally, Martin left the $100 price target as is, which implies 21% upside potential.', 'What exactly are these value upside drivers? First and foremost, Martin points to TTD’s Unified ID 2.0 solution. According to the analyst, this solution is “less about replacing Cookies and more about creating a targeting and measurement competitive advantage for the Open Internet versus Walled Gardens.”', 'Expounding on this, Martin stated, “TTD is trying to roll out Unified ID 2.0 into CTV targeting, and all other digital advantage channels, and then to convince advantage buyers that unduplicated reach and data granularity is much better in the Open Internet than from Walled Gardens such as Amazon, Google/ YouTube, Facebook, Roku, etc. Finally, TTD believes Unified ID has reached ‘critical mass,’ (our estimate is 150-200 million consumers) implying every company must accept Unified ID targeting.”', 'On top of this, Video revenue of $106 million made up 38% of the total Q2 revenue. Of this, $84 million, or 80%, was CTV.  ', '“TTD believes that the 79 million households in the U.S. that advertisers can reach using CTV ad units is larger than total linear TV homes… CTV revenues grew faster than 101% total revenue growth year-over-year. CTV consortiums like Open AP are making their targeting IDs comparable with Unified ID 2.0 as are some CTV owners directly, such as FUBO,” Martin said.', 'What’s more, Martin highlights the fact that its deal with Walmart adds shopper marketing total addressable market of $100 billion to TTD’s revenue in 2022, with the data integration still on track for completion in the fourth quarter of 2021.', 'It should be noted, though, that Walmart doesn’t pay TTD a revenue share, but rather, “TTD makes money from Walmart deal by attracting shopper marketing ad budget (TTD has ZERO of these today) from CGP advertisers that want to move products on shelves at Walmart.”', '“This is 100% a new TAM for TTD. TTD will charge its normal 20% take rate on this new revenue stream. Walmart is trying to mirror AMZN, which reported $7.3 billion of shopper marketing advantage revenues in Q2 2021,” Martin explained.', 'Achieving a 63% success rate and 26.2% average return per rating, Martin is ranked #130 out of over 7,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks.', 'Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch sees Plug Power as “leading the hydrogen ecosystem scale-up.” As such, the top analyst reiterated a Buy rating on the stock. At $62, Rusch’s price target suggests that 126% upside potential could be in store.', '“With PLUG delivering upside to Q2 2021 revenue expectations and raising 2021 revenue guidance, we believe the company is making sound decisions as it lays the foundation for growth of hydrogen as a transportation fuel. We believe expenses related to swapping out Air Products equipment in its hydrogen fuel supply chain as well as PLUG paying force majeure expenses builds strong customer loyalty and will help the company grow partnerships for hydrogen off-take agreements and vehicles,” Rusch said.', 'Leading up to the company’s Hydrogen Symposium, it revealed its estimated output and updated construction progress for the Rochester facility.', '“Leveraging automation, scale, and a seasoned leadership team, we believe PLUG can achieve significant product cost improvement at production scale. Management noted equipment is currently being installed, and expects to ship 250MW of electrolyzers out of the factory in 2021,” the analyst said.  ', 'Notably, this month, PLUG started working on its third green hydrogen plant, with this “expanding its reach to cover the majority of the eastern U.S./I-95 corridor,” said Rusch. As the combined production capacity will accelerate to 75 tons per day between the three plants, the analyst argues “this footprint provides critical scale for enabling commercial vehicle fuel cell adoption.”', 'Taking all of this into consideration, PLUG bumped up its guidance for FY21 gross billings from $475 million to $500 million, with the consensus estimate landing at $474 million. In addition, the company is calling for bookings of 250-500 MW of electrolyzers.', 'Ranked #10 on TipRanks’ list, Rusch boasts a 64% success rate and 65% average return per rating.', 'BTIG analyst Mark Palmer believes that investor focus should be landing on Verra Mobility. With this in mind, he reiterated a Buy rating and $19 price target, suggesting 18% upside potential.', 'Palmer acknowledges that the company’s Commercial Services segment, which provides automated tolling solutions to rental car companies (RACs), was “one of the most severely impacted businesses” in his coverage universe as a result of the COVID-19-related travel restrictions. That being said, given the company’s sufficient liquidity, its ability to generate free cash flow despite lower revenue and the revenue from the school speed zone camera installations in New York City during the pandemic, VRRM shares stabilized.', 'The tide appears to be turning though. Palmer said, “Now, VRRM’s Commercial Services segment is the primary driver of a reopening play that appears to be coming into sharper focus. The segment’s emphatic rebound during Q2 2021 enabled the company to post significant top- and bottom-line beats versus consensus estimates, spurring its stock price higher during today’s extended trading session. With management noting that the segment’s tolling volumes remained below pre-pandemic levels, the strong implication was that it would have ample room for additional upside as the pandemic’s impact on travel continues to abate.”', 'During the second quarter, the Commercial Services business delivered a surprisingly impressive performance. Revenue for the quarter came in at $66.5 million, a 144% gain from the year-ago quarter. In addition, adjusted EBITDA was almost $43 million, reflecting a 64% segment margin.', 'What was behind this strong showing? According to management, it was the recovery in leisure travel, which “arrived faster than they had anticipated due to the vaccine rollout and economic reopening as the reasons for the segment’s eye-popping results.”', 'Based on the solid second-quarter earnings results and favorable macro trends, the company brought back its full year 2021 financial guidance that was suspending due to the pandemic. Management is calling for total revenue of $510 million to $530 million, including the contribution from the Redflex acquisition, which closed in June.', 'Delivering a 66% success rate and 21.1% average return per rating, Palmer is among the top 150 analysts tracked by TipRanks.', 'Although Stifel analyst Scott Devitt sees a “minor marketing issue,” he thinks there is a “major market opportunity” for Poshmark.

Even though the analyst slightly reduced the price target from $50 to $48, the upside potential still lands at 75%.', 'In the most recent quarter, Poshmark posted GMV of $450 million, rising 25% year-over-year and beating Devitt’s $439 million call. Revenue clocked in at $81.8 million, also exceeding the analyst’s estimate of $81 million. Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA of $6.1 million easily beat Devitt’s $2.4 million forecast as marketing spend going into the quarter was lower-than-expected.', 'It should be noted that in the second quarter, changes to IDFA policy, which increased mobile advertising costs, affected the company. Management, however, believes these impacts will normalize throughout the rest of the year.', 'On top of this, Poshmark revealed that it is planning to expand its platform to India. Weighing in on this move, Devitt stated, “India is an attractive eCommerce growth market, with approximately 622 million active internet users and an increasingly active Gen Z and Millennial demographic, with strong resale momentum. On the call management continued to highlight international expansion as a key strategy to grow GMV and active users, and stated it will expand to new English-speaking countries (most likely the U.K., in our view) in the coming quarters.”', 'Reflecting another positive, Poshmark released a new integration within Snapchat called Poshmark Mini, enabling users to go to Posh Parties, shop Poshmark’s whole catalogue and engage with brands that have the most buzz on the platform.', 'The company also made several other improvements to the platform, including the addition of Style Tags to help with search, discovery and categorization as well as Price Suggester functionality to strengthen new seller efficacy.', 'The #34 best-performing analyst on Wall Street has achieved a 70% success rate and 34.8% average return per rating.

Chip company Skyworks Solutions, with about half of its sales from Apple, fell 2.4% and Lam Research slid 4%. Other chip suppliers like Broadcom, Micron and Intel, fell 1.2%, 1.8% and 1%, respectively. About 20% of Broadcom’s revenues come from Apple and about 5% of Micron and Intel’s come from the iPhone maker. Semiconductor companies Nvidia and Xilinx dropped 0.5% and 1.9% in early trading. Apple said Monday that it does not expect to hit its quarterly revenue forecast due to lower iPhone supply globally and lower Chinese demand as a result of the coronavirus. — Fitzgerald', 'General Mills said nearly half of its Haagen-Dazs ice cream shops in Greater China had been temporarily closed, amid the rapid spread of the coronavirus in the world’s second biggest economy. The epidemic has forced companies with significant exposure in China to temporarily shut stores. Some have also warned of a hit to their earnings. General Mills said it could not quantify the impact of the outbreak on its fiscal 2020 results at the time, although it reaffirmed its forecast for the fiscal year ended May 31. The Greater China region accounts for about 4% of the company’s net sales, with Haagen-Dazs shops and other food service outlets making up about 40% of that. The Minneapolis-based company said Haagen-Dazs stores that remained open were operating under severely restricted hours.

It also introduced new ways to add Alexa to third-party devices.', 'Here’s a full rundown.', 'Echo Dot. The company announced a new Echo Dot, its most popular Echo speaker. The Echo Dot is the best-selling speaker of all time, according to Amazon senior vice president of devices and services David Limp.', 'The new Echo Dot, which will cost $49.99, will be 70 percent louder and have clearer sound. It will have an industrial design, and the fabric face will come in multiple colors. Orders for the new Echo Dot start on Thursday, and it will ship next month to every country where Alexa is available.', 'Echo Plus. The new Echo Plus promises cleaner sound and better bass. It too will have a fabric design, as well as an internal temperature sensor. This new model will build on last year’s smart-home hub and will add lock controls so home commands will still work even if the WiFi is unavailable. It will cost $149, with orders starting Thursday. It will ship later this month.', 'Echo Show will get an upgrade with a 10-inch HD display, fabric body and improved sound. It will have dual side-firing speakers and an eight-microphone array. Bonus features include integration with Vevo for music videos and Hulu with live TV, as well as Microsoft Skype for video calling. Amazon Silk and Firefox browsers will also be included. It will sell for $229, with pre-orders starting Thursday. It will start shipping next month.', 'Microwave. The Amazon Basic Microwave is integrated with Alexa. It works in conjunction with a nearby Echo, but it failed to listen to commands initially during a test on Thursday. However, it eventually successfully started microwaving a potato based on voice commands. The microwave will cost $59.99, and ship later this year. CNBC previously reported Amazon was working on a smart microwave, among other products.', '“The user interface for a microwave is still stuck in the ’70s,” Limp explained.', 'Echo Auto. This in-car device will come with a dash mount, and is built on a new operating system from Amazon. It boots quickly so it is ready after the car is turned on. It connects to vehicles through Bluetooth, Bluetooth LE or an auxiliary jack. Data connections via a mobile phone can be used for Alexa integration.', 'Echo Auto will be able to understand location-based routines, like pulling up to a home can alert Alexa to turn on your lights. It can ask where the nearest Starbucks is, can read you an audible book, call a user’s home and call other Echos. And yes, it can provide navigation linked through Waze, Apple Maps and Google Maps. The device is $49, but will be $25 for special invitees, and will ship later this year.', 'Smart Plug. A $25 Alexa smart plug will allow users to plug items directly into it, and it will automatically sync with an existing Echo. A demo of the product allowed Limp to set up a smart lamp in 20 seconds using only voice commands.', 'Wall Clock. The company also announced an Echo Wall Clock, which can be used to set timers and other time-based Alexa tasks. It will cost $30, and ship later this year.', '“You never have to worry about daylight savings,” Limp said. “The motor will automatically change.”', 'Alexa Guard. Amazon also moved further into the security space.', 'Alexa Guard will take your Echo, smart lights and security service provider, if you have one, and sync them all together. Users could say, “Alexa, I’m leaving,” and the product will move all your Echo-linked devices into guard mode. Other smart alerts include away lighting mode, where smart lights will intelligently randomize lighting to make it look like someone is home. Alexa Guard will be integrated with Ring and home alarm company ADT to begin.', 'Security cameras. The company also announced new Ring stick-up security cameras, which come in wired and wireless versions. Each will be available for $179.99 later this year.', 'Fire TV Recast. A Fire TV Recast allows users to get over-the-air TV channels, which can be viewed on Echo Show, Echo Spot, Fire TV, iOS, Android and on-the-go outside the home. It will allow up to four shows to be recorded at one time, and can stream to multiple devices simultaneously. Price starts at $229.', 'Audio equipment. Amazon is getting more serious about audio, taking steps to match Apple’s HomePod line of audio-focused connected speakers. For instance, Echo will also soon be able to handle left and right inputs for stereo sound.', 'The Echo Link Amp and Echo Link couple with higher-end speakers, and an Echo Sub is available to add additional bass. The Echo Link will be available for $199 later this year, and the Echo Link Amp for $299 early next year.', 'The Sub will ship this month for $129.99, and pre-orders begin Thursday.', 'Integration with third-party devices. Echo products are expanding to work with other devices. A new Echo Input will give Alexa capabilities to existing speakers, microphones and Bluetooth devices. Amazon will sell the product with partners, including Bose, for $34.99.', 'An Alexa Connect Kit will allow the smart assistant to be added to other devices made by third parties. P&G and Hamilton Beach are among the partners.', 'New Alexa capabilities. Thursday’s announcements also included new abilities for Alexa. It will soon be able to understand when a person is whispering and will reply in a whisper.', 'The company will also add more podcasts for kids as part of Kids FreeTime for Alexa, as well as more than 1,000 Audible audiobooks for children.', 'A new skill called Alexa Hunches allows Alexa to combine routine things that a user often asks for into one command. For example, if you tell Alexa “good night” and the command usually turns off the lights, Alexa will also check other “good night”-related features, including seeing if your doors are unlocked. It will then make other recommendations based on its “hunches.”', 'In addition, Amazon is making it easier to set up devices by allowing users to save all network configurations online through a feature called WiFi simple setup. A new device will boot up, acknowledge previously recorded settings and set itself up. The ability to integrate with third-party devices will be added soon.', 'Note: CNBC parent company NBCUniversal is an investor in Hulu.']"

107,Chewy founder: We’re no Pets.com,2019-07-26T18:46:46+0000,"['In his most recent letter to investors, David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital wrote that today’s market bears resemblance to the tech bubble of 2000. He then compared Chewy, the company I founded in 2011 and ran as CEO until last year, to the ill-fated Pets.com.', 'I am no stranger to the Pets.com comparison. I heard it when I first started the business and again from nearly every venture capital firm I spoke with on Sandhill Road in Silicon Valley. After building Chewy for 8 years with a talented and dedicated management team, upon reading Einhorn’s comments I felt compelled to defend the business we built. The comparison to Pets.com is not only off-base but it does a great disservice to all the hard work the incredible people at Chewy have done over the years to build the world’s largest online pet retailer with more than 11 million loyal customers.', 'Since crashing and burning less than two years after its formation in 1999, Pets.com has served as the symbol for the capital markets’ excesses of the era. The company was fast growing, structurally unprofitable, and paid for sales by overspending on advertising.', 'Simply comparing the relative market capitalization and absolute cash burn does little without understanding the scale advantage, unit economics, and the inherent attractiveness of Chewy’s business model over its predecessor.', 'Mr. Einhorn’s primary complaint seems to be that Chewy is valued at 30 times what Pets.com was at its peak, claiming this as a reason for skepticism. He makes the point that in its heyday, Pets.com boasted a market capitalization of ~$400 million, which is dwarfed by Chewy’s more than $13 billion valuation, however these are useless metrics without context.', 'While Chewy’s current market cap is certainly more than 30 times that of Pets.com it also does 583 times more revenue, has positive gross margins, and boasts customer retention rates that outpace most software companies. While on a superficial level it is easy to draw parallels between the two highest profile online pet retailers, the reality is that Chewy is a fundamentally bigger, better and different business today than Pets.com ever was.', 'Chewy today is orders of magnitude larger than Pets.com, which allows it to leverage the high initial costs of shipping and fulfilling orders. Most people would find it futile to compare a company that did $6 million in revenue (like Pets.com) to one that eclipsed $3.5 billion last year. The importance of achieving scale in e-commerce cannot be overstated and is the first fundamental flaw in the comparison. Jeff Bezos explained this in Amazon’s 2000 letter to shareholders:', 'Online selling (relative to traditional retailing) is a scale business characterized by high fixed costs and relatively low variable costs. This makes it difficult to be a medium-sized e-commerce company. With a long enough financing runway, Pets.com and living.com may have been able to acquire enough customers to achieve the needed scale. But when the capital markets closed the door on financing Internet companies, these companies simply had no choice but to close their doors.', 'In order to make the necessary investments in its fixed costs – i.e. shipping and fulfillment infrastructure – an e-commerce company must grow fast enough that it can spread these high initial costs over a large enough revenue base. Unfortunately for Pets.com, the market wasn’t large enough to be viable at the time. In 2000 only 22% of Americans had ever made a purchase online and only 7% of Americans used the internet as a part of their routine product searches. The idea of buying anything online, let alone pet food, was a foreign concept to most consumers. This led to inefficient customer acquisition spending like $20 million on Super Bowl ads and a talking sock puppet, which never was able to move the needle fast enough for Pets.com to scale.', 'Internet companies today are doing billions in sales compared to millions of page visits 20 years ago. The rise of performance and direct marketing has reduced the friction in customer acquisition and allowed companies like Chewy to acquire customers more precisely and more cheaply than ever before.', 'The former Pets.com CEO, Julie Wainwright, explained the difference between then and now concisely in 2011:', 'Here is what the world looked like in 2000....there were no plug and play solutions for ecommerce/warehouse management and customer service that could scale...which means that we had to employ 40+ engineers. Cloud computing did not exist, which means that we had to have a server farm and several IT people to insure that the site did not go down. There were less than 250 Million worldwide Internet consumers in 2000- now there are 5 Billion. Amazon has reported a loss of nearly $900M in 1999...because guess what, ecommerce is a business of scale.', 'Since 2014, Chewy has grown from $200 million in sales to over $3.5 billion last year, now has over 11 million customers and purchases by existing customers represent 90% of revenue. The company has 7 distribution centers nationwide and can ship to 80% of the U.S. population overnight and almost 100% in two days. There’s no question that the fundamental barriers to scale exhibited in 2000 do not exist today, and that Chewy has been able to leverage its scale successfully over its history.', 'While Mr. Einhorn is correct in saying that Chewy has not been net profitable under GAAP standards, this obscures the core profitability of Chewy’s business. Between 2014 and 2018, the company burned only $134 million in free cash flow while growing revenue from $200 million to over $3.5 billion and spending approximately $750 million on marketing. Since inception, Chewy has had a positive gross margin and in the last three years the margin has expanded from 16.7% to over 20% in 2018.', 'While Mr. Einhorn may view marketing spending as throwing good money after bad, that is a misunderstanding of the lifetime value of a Chewy customer. By spending to acquire new customers, the company is deliberately depressing profitability of the existing customer base.', 'Given the underlying profitability and stickiness of existing customers, there was never a doubt that the marketing spend was yielding incremental returns above our hurdle rate. While the governor of growth has always been free cash flow, the lifetime value of customer acquisition was still above short-term profitability. Chewy could have been profitable years ago had we cut off the marketing spending, but it was a strategic decision to acquire and retain customers in order to maximize the long-term value of the business.', 'In Mr. Einhorn’s letter to his investors, he paraphrased Benjamin Graham in saying “Over the short-term the market is a voting machine and over the long-term it is a weighing machine.” I fundamentally agree with this quote, but not for the reasons it appears that Mr. Einhorn does. Just as the daily stock price is no indication of the quality of a business, the quarterly profitability of a company like Chewy has no bearing on the terminal value. We consistently chose to defer profitability in the short term in order to maximize shareholder value over the long term.', 'Value investing and entrepreneurialism are very much the same in the sense that they require contrarian decisions without immediate payback and run the risk of being misunderstood by the market for long periods of time. We’ve seen this playbook pay off for companies like Amazon and Netflix, but their success doesn’t make it any less nerve racking – especially when you have thousands of employees that depend on you for their job. Without conviction in the underlying economics of the business, I would have found it very hard to sleep at night if I thought our strategy wasn’t in the best interest of those employees, our millions of customers, or Chewy’s shareholders.', 'From day one, we chose to be a customer-obsessed business and replicate the experience of shopping in the neighborhood pet store. That meant focusing on bringing a human element to e-commerce and doing it at scale. Small touches like handwritten holiday cards and personalized pet portraits were ways we felt we could connect with customers and build loyalty over time.', 'While lots of companies talk about their flywheel, I truly believe that Chewy’s relationship with customers is the secret sauce. This is no more evident than in the fact that Chewy customers spend more with the company as time goes on – implying not only a level of trust but service and reliability. The net sales per active customer increased from $223 per year in 2012 to more than $334 in 2018.', 'All this to say that comparing Chewy to Pets.com is not only fundamentally incorrect but requires a deliberate misunderstanding of the evolution of e-commerce since the days of 1999-2001, as well as the importance of investing in the long-term viability of the business. While a quick glance may tell you that this business is no different than any other online pet retailer, ask any of Chewy’s customers and you’ll get a very different answer.', 'Even though I left Chewy last year, I’m extremely proud of the company and team we built.

The plans mention “Google Hardware” and “Nest,” which refers to the company’s connected home business. These buildings will also house general supplies and store items like furniture for local campuses, according to a company spokesperson. ', 'The new space comes as Google appears to be bringing more hardware efforts in-house under executive Rick Osterloh, who oversees devices and services, including Nest, the Google Home smart speakers, its flagship Pixel smartphone, and the PixelBook laptops.

That campus will require landscaping and construction updates to existing offices as opposed to totally new development, according to plans viewed by CNBC.', 'The company did not give a timeline for when it expects Midpoint to be completed. The Mercury News previously reported on some of the features.', '“The goal of the proposed project is to enhance pedestrian and bicycle safety and connectivity between the buildings and the surrounding community,” Vini Bhargava, a project executive with Google’s real estate and workplace services, wrote in a preliminary review request filed this summer.', 'The new campus also falls in line with the company’s shift to open itself up to its non-tech neighbors amid concerns of displacement. The proposed upgrades also come as the company plans for more employees to work in offices in the post-pandemic era.', 'Bhargava added that it wants to incorporate landscaping for “outdoor gathering and meeting areas to serve on-site employees.” To do so, she proposed turning concrete parking lots into green, landscaped sites that uses recycled water as well as planting trees to act as natural cooling systems and shade. The new features aim to “enhance wildlife habitat and pollination opportunities,” Bhargava added in her letter.

It also opened a second investigation into Amazon’s business practices related to the Prime label and the “Buy Box,” which offers customers a one-click button to add a product to their shopping cart.', 'Amazon rejected the European Commission’s accusations and said it supports thousands of businesses in Europe. ', 'If the European Commission finds that Amazon violated antitrust rules, the probe could provide new material to strengthen similar cases against Amazon in the U.S.', 'Congress and the Federal Trade Commission are also investigating Amazon’s treatment of third-party sellers. It’s unclear what the scope of the FTC’s investigation is, but the agency has been interviewing third-party sellers as part of the probe, Bloomberg reported in September. After a 16-month probe, the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee said last month that Amazon has monopoly power over third-party sellers.', 'Both investigations are in different stages. After publishing a sweeping report on the competitive practices of Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook, U.S. lawmakers are expected to introduce legislation based on their policy recommendations.', 'The EU hasn’t filed legal charges against Amazon, so it could be years before it announces any penalties. It could also reach a settlement with Amazon or drop the case altogether.', 'Regulators in Europe and the U.S. have objected to Amazon’s dual role as a marketplace operator and seller, arguing that this may foster anti-competitive conduct. ', 'They have pointed out that Amazon’s role as a marketplace service provider gives it privileged access to nonpublic third-party seller data, such as order volume history, shipping data and sellers’ past performance, that isn’t available to merchants. ', 'EU officials and Democrats in the House antitrust subcommittee share the view that this data from third-party sellers is used to inform Amazon’s first-party business decisions, such as what products to introduce and where to set the price. ', 'The insight “allows Amazon to focus its offers in the best-selling products across product categories and to adjust its offers in view of non-public data of competing sellers,” the EU said in a statement on Tuesday.', 'Similarly, the antitrust subcommittee’s investigation included testimony from third-party sellers who said their businesses were damaged when Amazon launched competing products. For example, one retired third-party merchant was forced to exit his seller business after Amazon allegedly copied his products, “down to the color palette,” undercut him on price and “took over the Buy Box for his listings, ‘killing his sales,’” the antitrust subcommittee said, citing an interview with the seller.', 'Amazon has long maintained that it doesn’t look at individual sellers’ data to build private-label products because doing so would violate internal policies. The company has acknowledged, however, that it may refer to aggregate data in the process of building its own products. ', 'Amazon has also rebutted regulators’ claims that it exploits its control over the Buy Box to give preferential treatment to its own products and those featured by sellers who use its logistics and delivery service, called Fulfillment By Amazon. The Buy Box refers to a section off to the side of a product page where sellers compete for their offers to be featured. ', 'Amazon has maintained that the Buy Box shows the offer it thinks customers will prefer, while factoring in things like price and delivery speed. At a July hearing in Congress, CEO Jeff Bezos acknowledged the Buy Box algorithm “indirectly” favors offers that can be shipped with Prime when determining which sellers are featured.', 'The House antitrust subcommittee probe and the EU investigation raised questions about third-party sellers’ ability to reach Prime users.', 'In the October report, U.S. lawmakers said they spoke to third-party sellers who feel they have “no choice” but to pay for Fulfillment by Amazon, which makes their products Prime eligible, in order to “maintain a favorable search result position, to reach Amazon’s more than 112 million Prime members, and to win the Buy Box.” ', 'Winning the Buy Box is crucial for third-party sellers products to be successful. The antitrust subcommittee estimated that roughly 80% of Amazon sales go through the Buy Box and “the percentage is even higher for mobile purchases.”', 'Prime members are also an important source of revenue for third-party sellers because they tend to generate more sales on Amazon’s marketplace than non-Prime users, the European Commission said. Prime members don’t just spend more money per purchase, but they also tend to shop on the site more frequently. ', 'With the EU and the U.S. questioning Amazon’s market power over sellers, it’s now up to Amazon to provide proof that it treats merchants fairly.', 'The company flatly disputed the House antitrust subcommittee’s findings, calling them “fringe notions.” Amazon can reply to the commission’s conclusions in writing or via an oral hearing.', '“The ball is in Amazon’s court to disprove these allegations,” said Shaoul Sussman, a legal fellow with the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit.', 'The EU and U.S. identified similar issues with Amazon’s treatment of sellers, but the potential penalties and remedies they could settle on are likely to be different.', 'Democratic staffers in the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust recommended a wide range of remedies, including forcing companies to prove mergers would not harm competition and splitting different business units. For Amazon, this could result in it spinning off the third-party marketplace from its core retail operations.', 'As for the FTC probe, Amazon could be hit with fines or the company could reach a settlement with the agency in which it agrees to certain business restrictions.', 'Similarly, the EU has a range of penalties it could propose, including a fine of up to 10% of Amazon’s annual global revenue, or up to $28 billion based on 2019 figures.', 'The EU could also propose behavioral remedies, which attempt to preserve competition by requiring the companies to refrain from certain business conduct. But behavioral remedies can be “hit or miss” in terms of effectiveness, since some companies may find it “more profitable to violate the remedy and just pay the fines if they’re found in violation again,” Sussman said.', 'The most aggressive tool in the EU’s arsenal would be to recommend a line of business separation, Sussman said. For Amazon, this might mean that the EU orders it to stop selling its private-label brands in Europe.', '“That type of decision won’t affect the U.S. or any other market where Amazon sells those goods, but they could say, if you’re transacting in Europe, you’re not allowed to be a brand owner or manufacturer and operator of the platform,” Sussman said.', 'Sussman and other antitrust experts said they remain skeptical of whether the U.S. will be successful in bringing a case against Amazon and even if antitrust officials do, the remedies are likely to be limited. By contrast, European regulators have stepped up their efforts to crack down on Big Tech companies like Facebook, Google and Apple in recent years, earning them the reputation of being more aggressive.', 'The U.S. and Europe have different approaches when evaluating whether a company is engaging in anti-competitive conduct.', 'U.S. antitrust law is centered on the consumer welfare standard, which relies heavily on increased prices as an indication of harm. That standard has been hard to apply to tech companies because many of the products and services offered are free, or low cost, in the case of Amazon.', 'In the U.S., a company like Amazon can argue that whatever harm it’s causing competitors is offset by any benefits to consumers, i.e. lower prices and greater selection, Sussman said.', 'That argument is harder to prove to European antitrust enforcers. The EU takes a wider view when determining whether a company’s business practices are anti-competitive, including harm to consumer choice, potential competitors and innovation.', 'As a result, it can be easier to bring an antitrust case in the EU than it is in the U.S., said New York University law professor Eleanor Fox. This is part of the reason why the U.S. is trying to catch up with EU regulators, Fox said, which have carried out a crackdown on U.S. tech giants including Google, Facebook and Apple.', '“That difference is what we’re struggling with and it’s why the U.S. has been so slow to make any claims at all,” Fox said.']"
117,"The used car boom is one of the hottest, and trickiest, coronavirus markets for consumers",2020-10-15T16:37:05+0000,"['For at least a few weeks during the worst of the Covid-19 shutdowns, ACV Auctions faced a challenge no start-up can be sure it can overcome: all of its core customers no longer allowed to be open for business. As car dealerships across the U.S. were put under lockdowns, the Buffalo, New York-based used car market technology company, which works with franchise and independent car dealers, was in a situation its CEO George Chamoun now recalls as “a bit scary.”', 'But like many pandemic surprise success stories, that period of uncertainty and existential crisis gave way to a boom in the buying and selling of used autos. By April and May, with a lack of new cars from auto plants able to hit dealer lots, and consumers more cautious about spending on big items, used car sales boomed. That has continued through the summer and fall: the past two months, August and September, posted the fastest rate of used car inventory turnover in the past six years, according to Edmunds.com data.', '“It wasn’t just a return back to pre-Covid,” Chamoun said at the CNBC Evolve virtual event on Thursday focused on middle market companies. “We’re selling higher units today than we were pre-Covid.”', 'In June, consulting firm AlixPartners estimated that due to the lockdowns, timeline to full auto factory restarts and a global consumer confidence decline, it expected a drop of 36 million new vehicle sales globally through 2022, compared to 2019 levels. In the U.S. market, it forecast a sales market for new cars lower by roughly 3.5 million vehicles year over year, with that outlook dependent on the recession not becoming prolonged. Automakers including GM have become more optimistic in commentary since the Q2 Covid-19 nadir, but even before Covid-19, the used car market was more than twice the size of the new car sales market.', 'Autonation and CarMax have been expanding their used car efforts, and their stocks have rebounded strongly from the Covid-19 stock market bottom in March. Carvana, which unlike ACV Auctions goes direct to consumers in selling used cars without dealers in the middle, has seen its stock increase from a $30 low point in March to over $200 today. Another online rival, Shift, is planning to soon go public soon through a special purpose acquisition company, which has become a prevalent way for private companies to IPO since the market began its recovery. Cars.com reported earnings on Thursday that sent its shares up 25%.', 'Overseas trends are similar, with private U.K.-based online car sales company Cazoo recently doubling its valuation.', 'The used car market in the U.S. is already estimated at 41 million units annually, and Chamoun says some of the changes triggered by the pandemic will continue to accelerate. The strength of consumers in the used car market shows that Americans continue to want to own vehicles, he says, whether to take kids to soccer or go to work. “Vehicles are the second highest-priced asset we as consumers purchase, so it’s really important and going to be important for the economy.”', 'ACV Auctions has 700 inspector teams and 100 regional managers working with car dealers across the U.S. to buy and sell used car inventory, and the company was forced to hire quickly as physical auctions became impossible for dealers during Covid-19 shutdowns.', 'Digital acceleration goals in the business world being compressed from years to months has been a major theme of the coronavirus economy across sectors, and in the auto sales market, more dealers are accepting the move to digital, Chamoun said, which is a major behavioral shift for the market.', 'Dealers have been going to physical auction locations for a long time, and business changes don’t take place all at once, Chamoun says, but when dealers suddenly could not go to a physical auction it shifted the behavior of dealers and has made more of the market willing to sell digitally, and bid on and buy vehicles online. “Both supply and demand are seeing an acceleration of dealers moving to digital,” Chamoun said. “We will see a more significant shift to digital over the next few years. It doesn’t mean cars won’t be in a physical location on a lot, but dealers will want to buy online and bid online,” he said.', 'The start-up, which became Buffalo’s first “unicorn” — a start-up valued at over $1 billion — in late 2019, has had to invent new technology tools to aid this shift in the used car market.', 'It built a tool to scan a car title and create electronic recognition of the documents so the title process could occur between buyers and sellers and ACV in a digital environment.', 'It also invented a way to scan the undercarriage of vehicle, called virtual lift, to take thousands of pictures of the undercarriage of cars as part of making the used car inspection process more transparent in a virtual environment.', 'And its AMP tool, for audio motor profile, can be attached to the engine of a used car and let both ACV and a dealer listen to the engine to make sure there are no potential issues.', 'During the first few weeks of the coronavirus shutdowns, Chamoun says his job was just trying to keep everyone calm since no one knew what would happen next with dealers or consumer sentiment. But that has changed. “What we really saw was strength.”', 'Online selling of cars is not entirely new. Speciality cars have been sold on platforms like eBay for years and dealerships have had the ability to sell cars online in a contactless experience, pre-Covid-19. But the pandemic has been a “next level” event, according to Edmunds.com senior manager of insights Ivan Drury. Some consumers will continue to want to interact in person and test drive up to as many as 10 cars, but the Carvana and CarMax models are taking the eBay specialty used car experience and making it more widespread for commuter cars.', '“These are Point A to Point B vehicles,” Drury said. “It’s a lasting trend. Will we see online sales grow at the level of Q2 2020? No. But at the same time it accelerated every dealership’s effort to really bolster up that part of the business.”', 'More consumers are interested in used cars in a weaker economy, and the new online models offer something that local dealers often can’t: a variety of models and custom features that can be shipped across states. “When it comes to availability and inventory and shipping across states, it’s been made so much easier,” Drury said. “There was such a drought in used vehicle inventory, even if I wanted to buy from a local dealer.”', 'The online experience also removes the “high-pressure situations” at dealers which many consumers prefer to avoid. “You control the flow online,” Drury said. That control advantage includes being able to break apart portions of the car buying and selling process, like trading in a current vehicle and adding it to the used car market. “You can do it online now and don’t have to trade in to a dealership. ... You can can see what the dealer will offer versus online, so there’s more control over each component,” he said.', 'But the auto consumer expert stressed that online businesses like Carvana and Shift Technologies remain small relative to the total size of the used auto market. Carvana sold a few hundred thousands units in all of 2019, and a little over 55,000 in the second quarter of 2020. That is in a used car market that is above 40 million units annually.', '“They are gaining traction and there is lots of market for them to transact on, but not everyone is doing it,” Drury said. He estimated Carvana and Shift combined sales at less than 1% of the market.', 'He also cautioned consumers about assuming that online companies are always the most competitive on price. The online competition is a good thing for consumer pricing options in general, but in some cases online sellers charge a premium for their service and inventory and shipping across states. That means consumers should always check to make sure the same vehicles are not available at a lower cost in a contactless online experience from a local dealership.', 'One reason prices rise is a limit on inventory, and there is a sector check on how much the used car market can grow even amid high demand. With 45% of new car sales relying on a trade-in as part of the financial equation, the used car market is linked to the overall sales environment for restocking of its inventory. At a time when consumers are buying less cars overall, the vehicles coming into the used inventory from rental agencies and dealer lease-ends are not enough to tilt the supply-demand balance.', '“Casting a wider net can help you get a better price,” said Brian Moody, executive editor at Autotrader.', 'He said the big issue right now in the used car market is the high demand. Prices have recently been rising on used cars, not going down over time, and that is something you rarely see in the market. Pricing has softened a little since the summer, but Moody said shoppers “shouldn’t go looking for deals.” Rather, they should be more focused on getting what they want. “I would shop around. ... but don’t be surprised if you end up having to pay more than expected for a specific car you want,” he said.', 'Many local dealers offering online sales do have virtual walkaround technology, test drives available at home, as well as delivery. They also have the advantage of offering access to a service department. “The local dealer is not completely out of the game,” he said.', 'Especially for consumers interested in recent models, between one and four years old, inventory will be stronger at dealers and they can offer you certified pre-owned vehicles, in some cases, at low APR financing as well.', '“People do want to buy cheaper cars but so many people are going for a lower price range there are fewer units out there and you have to get into older and older models to get cheap used cars,” Drury said. “Don’t discount the local dealer,” he added.  ', 'Even the auto experts are finding the current used car market a tough one to navigate in their personal consumer lives.', 'Drury was recently in the market for a used vehicle but ended up buying new because he said the prices were high on used cars he was interested in, and the incentives offered with the new vehicles were good. As the end of the calendar year nears, and 2021 models start showing up, prices on 2020 models may become even more attractive.', 'Buying a new car is always going to mean spending more, sacrificing as much as $12,000 to $15,000 in savings available on some used car models, but if a consumer’s budget is flexible, buying a new car can be the right decision. “I spent $10,000 more than I wanted to, but with the warranty and other benefits and new technology, it made more sense,” the Edmunds.com expert said. “There used to be a straightforward answer, but not right now.”   ', 'Autotrader’s Moody said his current car lease isn’t up for another year, and that’s a good thing in the current used car market. “I am relieved, relieved by the fact that I don’t have to make a decision in this tumultuous environment. People are paying more for used cars.”']"

That would make me a lot happier,” Hilt said.', 'To take up the slack she added, “I’m working pretty much seven days a week, morning, noon and night.”', 'Hilt’s upbeat holiday sales outlook is echoed by the National Retail Federation, which expects a roaring season, with sales during November and December projected to rise between 8.5% and 10.5% for a total of between $843.4 billion and $859 billion of sales. The projection tops last year’s numbers and would mark a new all-time high, even as a triple whammy of labor shortages, supply chain woes and inflation hit companies nationwide.', '“If retailers can keep things on their shelves, and that shippers can get the goods delivered to people’s homes by Christmas, it’ll be really a banner year for holiday spending,” said Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist at the NRF, who noted the staffing issue hits not only retailers in stores and online, but in the supply chain.', 'Supply chain disruptions and worker shortages could put a crimp in the party. According to the NFIB, 48% of small businesses say supply chain disruptions are having a significant impact. Of those who rely on holiday sales for a significant part of yearly revenue, 38% anticipate such shortages will impact sales.', '“We are seeing a shortage of workers in distribution and warehouse. Part of that is the timing of getting the products, even from the port, to the timing of these of these products getting into a distribution and warehouse area. They’re juggling hours, they’re juggling people, and people are working long hours,” Kleinhenz said.', 'Retail job openings hit 1.3 million in August according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and Challenger, Gray & Christmas projects 700,000 workers will be hired this season. The retail sector added 35,000 jobs in October according to BLS. Amazon, Target and Walmart and others are looking for hundreds of thousands of workers and bumping wages, offering bonuses and more to recruit.', 'Baltimore-based Under Armour said it’s entering the holiday season with more teammates than it’s had in years past in its retail stores. The company has hired 1,000 seasonal workers and is seeking 1,000 more workers to be brought on over the next few months.', 'UA credits a new in-store incentive program for all retail employees, seasonal, full-time and part-time, that allows for bonuses monthly that can equate to 8% or more of their take-home pay— in addition to a $15 an hour starting pay, up from $10 an hour this summer, to its staffing success so far.', '“We are in one of the most competitive environments that we’ve seen in a very long time, particularly in retail stores. I think that our decision earlier on in the year to increase that starting wage from $10 to $15, certainly helped us get ahead of the holiday hiring that we’re in right now,” Stephanie Pugliese, UA President of the Americas.', '“The holiday season is always a big peak time for any retailer to hire and make sure that we have enough teammates to satisfy the consumer demand, it really is a long-term investment that we have in the talent of our business. We’ve built our plans around investing in that talent on the go forward.”', 'Back in Michigan, Hilt said she isn’t immune to the supply chain hiccups rippling through the industry, but as bigger retailers face a lack of product, she’s positioned herself to succeed by selling local goods like house plants. Sales of plants really took off during the pandemic as homebound customers sought to spruce up their environments - and their zoom meetings.', '“We are definitely beating our projections from years prior, and our customers are happy—we love that everybody’s putting that focus into shopping local,” Hilt said. “I don’t have a lot of product hung up on a ship anywhere.”', 'Still, she’s paying well above minimum wage and offering extra perks like free lunches to workers. And most of all, she’s hoping small changes will help make the customer experience better in the face of thin staffing.', '“I feel like here’s some lemons and let’s make a whole bunch of lemonade,” Hilt said. “Having some people come in and do the stock before or after we’re closed, because if we do that when we’re open, that is detrimental to the experience for our customers who are in front of us, who did take the time to come out and want to do some fun shopping. They want us to be present for them, so we’re trying to just look a little more creatively.”', 'CNBC’s Betsy Spring contributed to this story.']"

And they also question whether it’s  being driven by commercial interests, or Chinese geopolitics.', 'About a year from the scheduled completion of a $5.2  billion Panama Canal extension that will let  the existing waterway accommodate bigger ships, a Chinese  consortium and the Managua government have said that they began  work on a Nicaragua canal. ', 'Read More', '  Hong Kong Nicaragua Canal Development Investment (HKND) claims  that it will complete the megaproject in 2019. (A project  “groundbreaking” cited by media reports in December was actually  just the start of an access road to let through heavy  equipment.)', '  The Nicaragua Grand Canal is projected to cost $50 billion, and  HKND says it will be able to accommodate ships of up to 23,000  twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs, a measure equal to 20 feet by 8 feet by 8 feet of  cargo). That compares with the 13,000 TEUs that the Panama  Canal will be able to accommodate after its expansion. ', '  But the 173-mile Nicaragua canal project has generated criticism  and skepticism, and lots of it. Industry experts question the  level of demand for a second canal, its potential as a going  business concern and the possible environmental impact in what  is geologically unstable terrain. Many even doubt that the  project will go much further than its paper proposal. ', '  “The vision is very significant, but the reality is, a lot of  people, including myself, are very skeptical that this will  happen,” said Eric Farnsworth, vice president at  the Americas Society and Council of the Americas, a  group that promotes democracy and free trade. “There have been  over 70 attempts to build a canal in Nicaragua, but it hasn’t  happened.” ', ' Read MoreDoubts deepen over Chinese-backed  Nicaragua canal', '  Farnsworth cited Nicaragua’s geological instability, including  active volcanos and earthquakes, as one reason the Nicaraguan  canal was never built in the first place. In 1902, Panama beat out Nicaragua for the  American-built canal route, when the U.S. Senate voted for the  smaller, more southerly nation by a mere eight votes. The canal  played an important role in the recent U.S. West Coast ports strike, which forced some  vessels to use the Panama route to get their goods to the East  Coast.', '  Meanwhile, Nicaraguan farmers opposing the canal construction  have organized protests—some of which have become  violent—because it would expropriate their lands. Activists  have also voiced loud concerns over the canal’s environmental  impact, pointing out that it would require the dredging of Lake  Nicaragua, the largest freshwater lake in Central America and a critical water  source. ', '  Like Farnsworth, a large number of experts who spoke to CNBC  have more questions than answers about the project, but they all  agree on one thing: There’s not enough demand to justify a second  canal so close to the Panama Canal.', '  “I sincerely believe we don’t need another canal. I don’t think  there’s enough ship traffic to warrant the construction of  another canal,” said Bruce Carlton, president and CEO of the  National Industrial Transportation League, a shipping industry  advocacy group.', '  Nicaragua refutes that argument. Telémaco Talavera,  official spokesperson for the Nicaragua Grand Canal project, said  that there will be demand from world shippers for their very  largest vessels, which even the improved Panama Canal won’t be  able to accommodate.', ' Read MoreCrime on the high seas: The world’s  most pirated waters', '  “The Triple-E type of ships won’t be able to go through the  Panama Canal, but Nicaragua will permit the passage of these  ships,” Talavera told CNBC, in an interview which like several  for this story is translated from Spanish. “There will be a need  for world shippers to reduce time, costs and pollution, and that  will be an opportunity for Nicaragua and the rest of the region.”', 'The Triple-E that Talavera refers to is a  1,312-foot ship, the largest ship by length that is operated by  Maersk, the world’s largest container-shipping company by  capacity. But even Maersk cast doubt on the need for a Nicaragua  canal.', '  “It’s not something we have a demand for, and we’re not able, at  this point, to tell whether we will use it,” said Michael  Storgaard, senior press officer at Maersk. “It may be so heavily  priced that we may not use it. We don’t know anything right now.”', '  Moreover, most ports in the United States won’t be able to  accommodate the larger ships that the Nicaragua canal is hoping  to target, said Jean-Paul Rodrigue, a transportation expert at Hofstra University. He added that it would require a hugely  expensive investment for U.S. ports to gear up for those types of  ships.', '  “The shipping industry is bleeding,” Rodrigue said. “The current  volume is not conducive for this type of investment.”  The shipping industry took a hit during the financial crisis when  many economies’ growth stalled and trade volume decline.', '  Hong Kong-based HKND, which won the canal project on a  no-bid basis and was granted a 50-year, renewable concession to  run it, is betting on an industry comeback: “China  should be expected to again accelerate its own economic growth in  the coming decades, while many other countries will re-establish  more respectable growth rates than those experienced in recent  years,” the group says on its website.', '  But even a comeback in demand on a global basis doesn’t warrant  another canal in Central America, critics say. Any given waterway’s future traffic volume is a bet that depends on economic trends on literally a global scale.', '  “General demand may grow at a moderate rate, but not necessarily  in the canal route, and not necessarily in the product category  that would make the route profitable in terms of tolls,” said  Rodolfo Sabonge, a former marketing and development executive of  the Panama Canal Authority, who was in charge of analyzing demand  projections for the expansion project. ', 'Read More', '  Sabonge pointed out, for example, that Brazil has seen huge  economic growth in Latin America, but anything that ships to or from a point south of Recife, depends on the Cape of Good Hope as its route to or from the Pacific. ', '  The Panama Canal expansion began in 2007, adding a third set of  locks and doubling its waterway capacity. The current locks allow  the passage of up to 5,000 TEUs, but after the expansion is  completed, the canal will be able to handle the passage of ships  with up to 13,000 TEUs.', '  “We didn’t decide the size of the new locks arbitrarily. We  decided them based on a study of demand, and we chose the lock  size that made sense for the next 15 years,” he said of the  Panama’s Canal’s expansion. ', '  Nicaragua’s motivation for the canal is obvious. The Central  American country is the second-poorest country in the Americas,  after Haiti, with 42.5 percent of its population living in  poverty (2009). The project would generate 50,000 jobs during its  construction phase, and another 200,000 jobs once it is  in operation. Panama, a prosperous economy, with an economic  growth rate of 8.4 percent, is in many ways a reflection of what  Nicaragua could have been.

It will be a development process that will help us  get rid of our main enemy—poverty,” said Francisco  López, vice chancellor at the Universidad Central de  Nicaragua. ', '  The development plans include the building of roads, two  ports—one in the Pacific and another one in the  Caribbean—an airport, a free trade zone and a tourism complex  with hotels. HKND has approval to build some of the  other elements even if it doesn’t build the canal  itself. ', '  The motivation for HKND is less clear, and the company did not  respond to CNBC’s repeated requests for comment.', '  Given the project’s expected costs of operation, the tolls  in the much larger Nicaragua Grand Canal would have to be considerably higher  than the tolls in the Panama Canal in order for  investors to benefit from the project.', ' Read MorePort slowdown costing small businesses  time and trust', '  The canal would need to generate an annual income of about $5  billion, explained Sabonge. But the  Panama Canal, with a transit of 13,482 ships, carrying 327  million tons, generates annual revenue of only about $2 billion,  according to 2014 figures. ', '  Naturally, the lack of an apparent financial feasibility has  raised questions about whether the Nicaragua Grand Canal is a commercial project for HKND—or a geopolitical project for  the Chinese government.', '  “If an investor doesn’t see that there’s a viable option, or  demand out there to make a profit, they wouldn’t make an  investment. That leaves the question of maybe it’s coming from  the government,” said Chang Qian Guan, a professor at the U.S.  Merchant Marine Academy. ', '  HKND and the Nicaragua government have both denied that the  Chinese government is involved. It’s worth noting as well that  Nicaragua and China don’t have formal diplomatic relations.  China, however, has expressed interest in the past in building a  railway across South America as an alternative to the Panama  Canal. Most Chinese imports to and from the region travel through Panama. ', '  Controlling that passage would be a boost to China’s commercial  security, something that Beijing has already  demonstrated—through its actions in the South China Sea, East China Sea, Africa and  elsewhere—is a political priority of the first order.', '  If Beijing is the project’s real sponsor, then its essentially  limitless pockets would mean big problems for Panama.', '  “If there are geopolitical interests behind the building of the  canal, and the investment returns do not matter, and nothing has  to be repaid, then the Panama Canal would be severely affected.  There is not enough demand for two canals,” Sabonge said. ', '  “But if the Nicaragua canal has to adhere to what any other  business has to, from an investment standpoint, I think the canal  wouldn’t be much of an impact for the Panama Canal,” he  said. “Based on investment requirements, the prices of the  Nicaragua canal would be very high, and the Panama Canal would be  able to maintain its profits and lower prices.” ']"

The primary goal of the mission is to deploy two satellites in orbit for BlackSky.', 'Beck’s company wants to recover the boosters so it can launch more often, while also reducing the cost of each mission. ', 'But Rocket Lab’s approach to recovering its boosters is different from SpaceX, which uses the rocket’s engines to slow down during reentry and deploys wide legs to land on large pads.', 'Rocket Lab, instead, is testing a technology Beck calls an “aero thermal decelerator”—using the atmosphere to slow down the rocket. After reaching space, Rocket Lab’s onboard computer guides the booster through reentry—where it travels at up to eight times the speed of sound and is subject to heat in excess of 4,350 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'Then a parachute deploys from the top of the booster to slow it down and, like its first recovery in November, splash down in the Pacific Ocean. ', 'The splashdown is expected to occur about 400 miles from the launch site, where a Rocket Lab ship will then scoop it out of the water. Beck said this is the second of three planned splashdown recoveries, before the company moves to its full reuse plan: Plucking the booster with its parachute from the sky with a helicopter.', 'Rocket Lab is in the process of combining with Vector Acquisition, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), in a deal which values the space company at $4.1 billion. The merger is expected to close in the second quarter, when Rocket Lab will list on the Nasdaq and the SPAC’s shares, which currently trade under the ticker VACQ, will convert to RKLB as the combined company.', 'A SPAC is a shell company that’s set up to raise money via an initial public offering in order to merge with an existing private company and take it public.', 'Beck said the Electron booster for this next mission will feature a “beefed up heat shield,” as the heat shield on the prior recovery mission “took a real beating” during the intense reentry. ', 'Overall, the rocket booster “was in remarkable shape,” and the company now “understands the load” on the heat shield better, he added.', 'Beck said there will be one more major upgrade before the third splashdown recovery mission. ', 'The external changes are minimal, he noted, with most of the updates affecting “subtleties around control and managing the thermal load” on the booster.', 'Rocket Lab’s goal is to “do the minimum amount of refurbishment possible” with the boosters it recovers, so it can turn them around quickly between launches. The company is reusing parts from the first Electron booster it recovered, which is now “severely disassembled,” Beck said. ', 'While the booster took “a quick dunk in the saltwater for a few hours,” he said Rocket Lab has yet to find any lasting problems with parts that it plans to requalify and launch on other rockets.', 'Once the company completes all three splashdown tests this year, it will move to the mid-air recovery attempts. ', 'Rocket Lab demonstrated that it can catch a booster with a helicopter in a test last year, which Beck noted they did on the first try.', 'Rocket Lab’s Electron rocket has carried more than 100 small satellites to orbit over the past couple of years. The company has also built a spacecraft manufacturing business.', 'Beck’s company has launch facilities in New Zealand and Virginia. Rocket Lab’s first launch from the U.S. has been delayed by regulatory reviews and is not expected to be complete until later this year.', 'The additional launch facility will be key, as Rocket Lab last year said it had 26 missions booked for 2021. Having both facilities gives the company as many as 132 launch opportunities per year.', 'Last November, Beck said Rocket Lab was building Electron boosters in under 30 days, and told CNBC that the company is now down to 26 days—with its goal to get production to a rate of one rocket every 18 days.', 'Rocket Lab also unveiled plans for a second, larger rocket called Neutron to lift more payloads than its current Electron rocket. The launch marketplace is divided into three sections: small, medium and heavy lift. Neutron will target that medium section.', 'Neutron, which is expected to launch in 2024 for the first time, will stand at 131 feet tall and will be capable of carrying as much as 8,000 kilograms to low Earth orbit. Rocket Lab did not disclose how much Neutron is expected to cost per launch.', 'The company expects Neutron to cost about $200 million to develop. Its first launch will come from NASA’s Wallops flight facility in Virginia. Rocket Lab plans to build a Neutron-specific factory in the region.', 'Neutron will also have a reusable booster, but the new rocket will “land on an ocean platform” using a propulsive landing. Electron “was always designed to be really, really manufacturable rather than really, really reusable,” Beck said.', 'Musk, shortly after Rocket Lab unveiled its plan for Neutron, commented that the rocket “looks familiar” but is “nonetheless, the right move.” SpaceX conducted multiple short flight tests of prototypes as it perfected landing its Falcon 9 rocket booster, a route Beck isn’t sure Rocket Lab will take.', '“Whether or not we see the need for hop tests is really to be determined, but our kind of current baseline doesn’t have us doing that,” Beck said.']"

Apple may continue selling these models -- typically, it knocks $100 off the price of last year’s models and keeps them on store shelves.', 'Apple’s tagline for the event is “Hi Speed,” a reference to the faster cellular speeds promised by 5G phones.', 'Investors and analysts have hoped for years that a 5G iPhone would represent a major upgrade and spur a big wave of sales not only for phone makers like Apple, but also for chip-makers like Qualcomm and carriers like Verizon and T-Mobile, which have bet big on 5G.', 'But some industry leaders are cautious. For instance, AT&T Communications CEO Jeff McElfresh told CNBC in September that he did not believe it would be a “massive event.”', 'Some of the impact may be blunted because there are three different varieties of 5G.', 'The biggest jump in speeds will come from the variety of 5G sometimes called millimeter wave or ultrawide band.

While carriers are expanding quickly, the new iPhones may only be able to reach their full potential in a handful of regions.

But the minimum guaranteed producer price for a kilogram of cocoa now stands at 825 West African CFA francs ($1.45).', 'This comes despite a rise in prices on New York’s ICE exchange. Cocoa futures have risen by around 10% between the end of October 2020 and the end of October this year.', 'Lower prices are expected to plunge farmers into poverty, increase the prevalence of modern slavery and add to the rates of illegal child labor.

It is estimated that 70% of the world’s cocoa comes from West Africa, with the Ivory Coast accounting for more than a third of global supply.', '“With this price of 825 francs and the costs of production, we’re going to find it difficult to feed our families, to look after ourselves and to invest in the farms,” Doumbia said via video call. “We accept the price because we have to.”', 'But she said higher prices also created headaches for cocoa producers, as chocolate makers allegedly resist paying higher market values.', 'In 2019, Ivory Coast and Ghanaian authorities introduced a Living Income Differential, which added $400 to the price of a ton of cocoa in a bid to protect farmers from poverty.', 'However, some chocolate companies reportedly tried to avoid complying with the LID. Mondelez International was accused by authorities of failing to pay the premium — an allegation it denied — while U.S. candy giant Hershey turned to futures exchanges to avoid paying the additional cost, Reuters reported. Hershey said in a statement at the time that it would not discuss details of its specific buying and hedging activities. The company told the news agency it bought cocoa “from a variety of suppliers and sources,” including some that saw it pay Ghana and the Ivory Coast’s LID premium.', '“A year ago, when the price was 1000 francs, we were struggling to sell our cocoa because Big Chocolate thought it was too expensive,” Doumbia told CNBC. “So yes, it’s difficult to accept a lower price, but now we might actually be able to sell all of our cocoa.”', 'Doumbia said she has seen soil fertility decrease over the years, which she attributes in part to climate change, prompting her to dedicate four hectares of farmland to rubber instead of cocoa.', '“Producing cocoa is a culture in Ivory Coast, we produce the most in the world so it’s not going to disappear overnight,” she told CNBC. “At least every family has a person that produces cocoa – it’s what we love to do, it’s our job, it’s in our hearts.”', 'But she added: “People are abandoning cocoa for rubber. With such painful work and such a low price for cocoa, you’re going to see that more and more for sure.”', 'According to a 2018 report on the industry from the VOICE Network — a global network of NGOs and Trade Unions — large chocolate companies increased their profits after the Ivory Coast’s cocoa prices dropped significantly in mid-2017.', 'Dutch chocolate maker Tony’s Chocolonely pays a premium on top of the farmgate price when it purchases its cocoa. It recently announced plans to increase that premium from $462 per metric ton – 26% above farmgate price – to $793 per metric ton – 54% above farmgate price – for the 2021/22 season.', 'Paul Schoenmakers, head of impact at Tony’s Chocolonely, accused so-called Big Chocolate of “turning a blind eye” to the plight of African cocoa farmers “in quite a terrible way.”', '“For decades, they’ve come up with all these fancy programs and the reality is that they haven’t yielded any results,” he told CNBC via telephone. “And that’s mainly because they still pay too little for cocoa.”', 'He added that paying the price suggested by Tony’s would cost around 0.7% of annual global chocolate revenues.', '“Given that this sector is super rich, they’d still make massive profits every year,” Schoenmakers said. “This is about shipping part of the value to the first part of supply chain, the cocoa farmers, and it’s the right thing to do.”', 'According to Fairtrade, the average cocoa farming household in the Ivory Coast is made up of eight people and has an annual income of around $3,000.

But, we have to take action now, together with our partners in the private sector, to reduce the backlogs that we’re facing,” he said. “Now that we have seen how vulnerable these lines of global commerce can be, we cannot go back to business as usual.”', 'Biden, alongside leaders from 14 other countries and the European Union, agreed to “foster greater international cooperation on near-term supply-chain disruptions,” according to a White House readout of the meeting. The leaders also plan to strengthen and diversify the entire supply-chain ecosystem from reliance on certain raw materials to manufacturing to shipping and distribution.', 'The world’s supply chain is continuing to bear the brunt of a relentless pandemic, surging consumer demand, labor shortages and overseas manufacturing delays, which has led to higher transportation costs and inflation.', 'In an effort to address the U.S.’s own supply-chain issues, Biden also announced the following domestic measures:', 'Earlier this month, the Biden administration unveiled a plan to run operations 24/7 at the California ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which account for 40% of sea freight entering the U.S.', 'Last week, the twin ports announced new fines on carriers at the nation’s busiest port complex in order to abate the intensifying logjam of cargo ships.', 'Once loaded off vessels, containers moved by trucks will have nine days before fines start accruing.

They and four additional people familiar with conditions there describe working through high heat, cold temperatures at night and smoky air during last year’s wildfires in Northern California.', 'Their disclosures highlight the difficult balance Tesla must strike as it ramps up production while trying to stem costs.', 'Tesla recently told shareholders that in the three months that ended June 30, it made 87,048 vehicles, including 72,531 Model 3s, the company’s lowest-priced sedan. Both were quarterly records. Tesla told shareholders to expect full-year deliveries this year to reach at least 360,000, and more than 250,000 of those are expected to be Model 3s.', 'Last year, Tesla conquered some “production hell” issues, as CEO Elon Musk called them. That included removing or repurposing conveyors and robots that didn’t work as planned, and figuring out how to build cars and battery packs with more manual labor.', 'This year, Tesla has been grappling with what could be described as “logistics hell.” It has had to deliver cars to customers in more points around the world than ever before. Tesla executives have said the company should be profitable in the second half of 2019.', 'A Tesla spokesperson said the anecdotes employees shared about work in the tent are “misleading and do not reflect our manufacturing practices or what it’s like to work at Tesla.”', 'The spokesperson said many of the shortcuts described by employees, such as using electrical tape during assembly, are not approved procedures, and that cars are rigorously inspected before shipping. Tesla also said many of the parts used in the Model 3 come with electrical tape on them from suppliers, and showed CNBC photographs of some factory-taped parts.', 'The company said its first-pass yields at the Fremont, California, plant are higher than ever — a measurement that indicates Tesla is producing good cars and is scrapping or reworking fewer units than it did historically.', 'Regarding working conditions in the tent, Tesla said, “We work hard to create a work environment that is as safe, fair and fun as possible, and it is incredibly important to us that employees look forward to coming to work every day. In fact, we have a large number of employees who request to work on GA4 based on what they hear from colleagues and what they have seen first-hand.”', 'Tesla assembles some of its Model 3s in a tent, known as GA4 (“general assembly 4”) in Fremont. Built in spring 2018, it was supposed to be a temporary measure. The idea was to run the tent mostly on manual labor while Tesla perfected its automated factory lines indoors in what’s called “the brick.” The tent has now been operating for more than a year.', 'Workers told CNBC that GA4 is now able to produce up to 120 cars per shift, across three shifts per day, amounting to 2,160 Model 3s in a perfect six-day week, or around 30,000 per quarter assuming maximum rates of production.', 'Tesla did not confirm these numbers, but in a statement last year, the company said GA4 was responsible for about 20% of total Model 3 production during a high-output week in July 2018.', 'While the tented line does not crank out the majority of Tesla’s Model 3s, it still adds significant volume. When Model 3 lines inside the Fremont factory go down, workers in the tent can stay productive. That’s important to Tesla, given its history of over-automation and missed targets.', 'In the tent, Model 3s are put together using manual labor and power tools, lifts and conveyors, but not with any of the sophisticated robotics Tesla uses on the indoor assembly lines. Workers say they do one process at their station repeatedly, usually walking along the line with the car until they’re done.', 'Carlos Aranda was a former lead production associate who worked in GA4. Correspondence shared with CNBC shows he resigned from Tesla on June 24, following months of medical leave stemming from injuries he says he sustained on the job. (Tesla claims he was fired for a Twitter post that went against its Workplace Violence Policy, but provided no record of the offending tweet prior to publication, and the separation papers Aranda shared with CNBC do not mention a tweet. After publication, Tesla pointed to a tweet in which Aranda said, “I am so sick of tesla giving me the run around. I am about to quit and burn them to the ground. With what i know i can put a big monkey wrench in the works.”)', 'His wife, Maggie Aranda, worked as a Model 3 production associate in another part of GA4. She says she was dismissed on June 11 for using her phone during a shift to book health appointments after an injury. Both the Arandas previously worked on indoor assembly lines at the factory.', 'Six current and former employees supported their accounts of work in GA4 but asked to remain unidentified.', 'These people said that while work in GA4 is physically demanding, many people like working there because the atmosphere is good and camaraderie is strong. They said they can listen to music while they work, with a supervisor’s approval, and don’t always have to wear a uniform.', 'At the same time, workers were encouraged to take shortcuts to hit their production goals in the tent, according to five people who work or worked there recently.', 'For example, when it’s cold in the tent, workers tend to break a high number of plastic brackets and housings that hold critical electronics in place inside of the Model 3, according to four of these people.', 'Rather than waiting for replenishment teams to deliver boxes of new plastic parts to their stations in GA4, they said, supervisors told workers to use vinyl electrical tape to make quick fixes. Carlos Aranda says he personally visited Walmart multiple times to buy the tape and other items for production associates.', 'For instance, this photo shows tape applied to a segment of a white plastic housing where it holds “triple cam” connections in place inside of a Model 3. The Arandas said the edge of this plastic housing piece would frequently crack during installation, and tape was often applied here to hold down the resulting, hinge-like flap.', 'Installed in the windshield of a Model 3, a “triple cam” holds three cameras that allow the vehicle to see the road, traffic lights, lane markings and obstacles ahead. If triple cam connections loosen or break, some of Tesla’s safety features — like Sentry mode, AutoPilot, automatic emergency braking or full self-driving — may fail, the Arandas said. The car should then give drivers an alert that AutoPilot is no longer engaged, and the car needs service.', 'Tesla said many of the parts they use in the Model 3 come with electrical tape on them from suppliers, and showed CNBC photographs of some factory-taped parts.', 'Current and former GA4 workers acknowledged this, too. However, they made a distinction — the GA4 workers use tape to fix housings or brackets with cracks or to stop parts from vibrating in the car if they aren’t snapped or fastened in perfectly. That’s not the same as “factory tape,” they said.', 'Factory tape is high-quality and looks as if it’s shrink-wrapped on a part, always in the same place. Much of it is wound carefully around bundles of cables and wires in a perfect spiral. The tape that workers would apply in a Model 3 typically has hastily cut or torn ends and varies in placement.', 'A Tesla spokesperson says the company hasn’t found evidence of electrical tape being used to make quick fixes in GA4, and would never officially condone or encourage it. The company also emphasized that its cars go through rigorous quality inspections before they leave the factory.', 'A former Tesla technician, who worked in the tent on Model 3s and asked to remain unidentified, analyzed photos from GA4 that were shared with CNBC by current and former employees.', 'This person said Tesla’s vehicle engineers would probably not appreciate that Model 3s were being assembled with this cheap vinyl electrical tape, and any processes allowing prodigious use of the tape during assembly should be reevaluated.', 'The technician also emphasized that the Tesla Model 3 is an ideal electric vehicle — as long as it’s built exactly to spec.', 'Workers say they took other short cuts to hit aggressive new production targets, too.', 'Five people who work or worked in the tent in 2019 said they would frequently pass cars down the line that they knew were missing a few bolts, nuts or lugs, all in the name of saving time.', 'In the tent, most workers have just a couple of minutes to complete a process. If a small item was missing, or a bolt was not torqued in perfectly, they would rather keep cars moving than stop the line and be seen as a bottleneck to production, they said.', 'In particular, these people said, aeroshields are often missing a middle bolt, and loose connections in body controllers are a common issue.', 'For example, this photo shows the power supply for a distribution block in the front right vehicle controller in a Model 3. A nut is missing that should be there to secure electrical connections.', 'Wires in this part of the car go to the touchscreen, car computer, door latches and window regulators on the right hand side of the Model 3, while the red cable distributes power into the systems on the right hand side.', 'Although it’s a low-voltage connection, if it’s not properly secured, it can heat up and cause problems, the former Tesla technician said. Model 3s with loose connections can be hard to detect during inspections, the ex-technician and factory workers said.', 'Tesla said the company “has a robust quality assurance team that reviews each vehicle at the end of the GA4 assembly line to ensure every car was built correctly and is perfect before it leaves our factory to go to customers.”', 'Current and former employees also said Tesla reduced “water testing” on cars as the company began ramping up production of Model 3s.', 'In a water test, a vehicle goes into a booth where jets blast it with water from all different directions. Any leaks in the seals are immediately found and fixed. The tests take about 10 minutes each.', 'In late 2018, Tesla changed its policy and now only conducts sample testing for water leaks on Model 3s.', 'Since then, if workers see an issue with the urethane seals around a Model 3 glass roof, for example, they can request a water test. But many in GA4 are hesitant to make that request because of time pressure and a lack of experience or training that they need to identify flaws, a current associate said.', 'A Tesla spokesperson said the company is not aware of any instances where workers were told not to do water testing because that may slow production. The company says it encourages employees to identify opportunities for improvement, and engage all appropriate teams to evaluate potential risks and identify possible solutions.', 'In addition, six current and prior employees said, workers often violated a rule that cars should only be driven in “factory mode,” which now limits speed to 10 mph. Workers would sneak freshly built Model 3s out of factory mode to zip them over to a camera calibration station (or “cam cal”), which was located far away from the GA4 tent. (That station has since been moved closer to the tent.)', 'Employees caught doing this would be appropriately disciplined, Tesla said.', 'Mike Ramsey, senior automotive research director at Gartner, said that even before Tesla put a Model 3 assembly line in a tent, it had a “ship-it-now, fix-it-later” mentality inspired by software patching.', 'Tesla’s focus, instead, has been to exceed expectations in other areas like brand, vehicle acceleration or charging, he said. While Tesla has been successful with those efforts, he said: “Every time a car rolls off the lot and a piece of trim falls off, or an electrical system is failing after a month, it undermines the brand. That customer is not likely to buy another Tesla.”', 'Ramsey also said, “The idea that you would not stop the line, and would patch something with spit and bailing wire — OK, not literally that, but close to it — almost certainly injects quality issues down the road that they are going to have to fix.”', 'Exposure to the elements in GA4 poses another problem for the workers.', 'Six current and recent Tesla employees said GA4 workers have repeatedly asked Tesla’s environmental health and safety teams to help with cold temperatures overnight, sweltering heat during the days, and pests — including mice and bugs — in the tent.', 'They say workers commonly deal with heat rash and heat exhaustion.', 'Tesla installed big fans in GA4 to distribute heat and circulate air. However they are not on consistently, these people said, and usually don’t make a big difference.', 'Tesla said its environmental health and safety team monitors temperatures to ensure they are within a comfortable range for the safety of employees, production equipment and car parts. They also said they provide temperature controls like cool fans, hydration, rest breaks and heat stress awareness training to employees.', 'Hot, dry conditions can also lead to problems with air quality.', 'Correspondence reviewed by CNBC shows that Tesla required GA4 workers to report for duty even as wildfire smoke floated up from the massive Camp Fire that devastated Northern California in November. On Nov. 9, the day after the Camp Fire ignited, the AirNow Air Quality Index rated Fremont at an “unhealthy” 165, and continued in the unhealthy range for at least another week.', 'Tesla did not proactively distribute respirator masks to GA4 workers in the first few days after the Camp Fire began. Workers had to request the masks, according to internal correspondence shared with CNBC. Inside the building portion of the factory they had HVAC and good air flow, but tent workers were stuck, said Maggie Aranda, and they did not get time off due to the smoke.', 'Tesla says it offered air filter masks who those who wanted them and provided face masks every day as a precautionary measure.', 'When conditions turn cold and wet, other problems arise. For instance, this photo shows rain seeping into the tented roof at GA4.', 'Employees wear layers, and big coats that can impede their movement. Supervisors distribute disposable hand-warming packets that workers slip into their gloves or tape to their bodies. Tesla provided big red jackets for GA4 workers last year, but stopped distributing them by early 2019, according to several current and former employees.', 'On cold nights early this year, workers in a tented “paint hospital” sometimes used heat lamps, which are used to dry paint and clear coat on cars, to warm their own bodies, according to current and former production associates. This paint hospital has since been moved indoors, according to public records with the city of Fremont.', 'At a GA4 station where employees checked Model 3 vehicle alignment, Carlos Aranda said, workers used space heaters in late 2018. But when it rained, water seeping into the tent from above and below made these a hazard, he said.', 'He shared photos of a leaking roof and space heater there, plugged in, with rain puddling nearby. Tesla says using space heaters is against company policy.', 'Pests are another problem. In the second quarter of 2019, Tesla employees said, mice chewed through wires and caused a conveyor breakdown in early May, delaying Model 3 production on at least one shift. Tesla said it has no record of this occurring.', 'A former physician’s assistant who worked at Tesla’s on-site clinic, Anna Watson, said: “It was general knowledge that the GA4 tent and North Paint were the most challenging places to work at Tesla,” during her brief tenure there in 2018. Another former Tesla HR employee confirmed this, and said the tent was seen as a place for tougher workers, or young blood.', 'Tesla offered the following statement in response to this story:', 'Tesla also noted that former employee Carlos Aranda tweeted in April that he had received a $207 donation with a comment “compliments of $TSLAQ” to a GoFundMe he started to cover losses from injuries he said he sustained on the job, which made it impossible for him to work. $TSLAQ is a shorthand term on Twitter used to describe investors who have shorted the stock.', 'Follow @CNBCtech on Twitter for the latest tech industry news.']"

So Jassy picked a person he trusts to replace him as the head of the Amazon unit providing cloud tools for hosting websites and applications.', 'Now it will be up to Adam Selipsky, who was Jassy’s right-hand man up until a few years ago when he left to become CEO of Tableau Software, to build on Amazon’s already impressive lead.', 'AWS controlled 47% of the cloud infrastructure market in the first half of 2020, according to estimates from industry observer IDC, more than the next four providers put together: Microsoft, Alibaba, Google and IBM.', 'Like Jassy, Selipsky saw AWS grow up and immerses himself in the details across many topics. As recently as 2016, when he gave up his position of vice president for sales, marketing and support, Selipsky sat in on Jassy’s back-to-back “chop” meetings to discuss proposals.', 'While Jassy was the last person to comment, Selipsky was second to last, said Jay Wampold, marketing chief of cloud-development start-up Pulumi and a former AWS product marketing director.', 'Amazon workers for decades have leaned on 14 leadership principles such as “customer obsession” and “bias for action.” People who know him said Selipsky embodied those principles, like Jassy. He’s also well acquainted with Amazon’s practice of coming up with fake press releases and frequently-asked-questions documents for potential products. It probably won’t take long for Selipsky to remember the rhythm of working at Amazon.', 'But one thing that distinguishes Selipsky from other candidates is that he ran analytics software company Tableau, both as a publicly traded company and as a part of Salesforce. Under Selipsky, Tableau’s stock rose as revenue growth accelerated and he led a shift from selling one-time software licenses to subscriptions. He then helped sell it to Salesforce in 2019 for $15.7 billion, which was the company’s biggest acquisition ever at the time.', '“More and more, organizations are demanding subscription purchasing options for all of their software, and data analytics is no different. It’s no surprise why, as with subscription, our customers get the full power and simplicity of Tableau with lower risk, lower upfront investment and more flexibility,” Selipsky told analysts on a 2017 conference call. The push succeeded: By 2019 84% of Tableau’s revenue came from subscriptions.', 'Leading Tableau gave Selipsky greater exposure to the complexities of selling software for non-technical users, said Jay Heglar, chief business officer of Tableau competitor Domo and formerly an AWS sales leader who worked with Selipsky. Now, Heglar said, Selipsky can go back and try to boost adoption of the cloud applications offered by AWS, which historically have not been as popular as its low-level computing, storage and database products.', 'For example, being at Tableau meant allying with resellers that can get software into large accounts, Heglar said. Selipsky could call for Amazon to refine its approach there to promote applications such as the Amazon Chime video-calling service -- which is far from a household name like Zoom, or even Skype.', 'Working at Salesforce might have given Selipsky some new perspective on how to make AWS even bigger. Salesforce spent four times as much on sales and marketing as on research and development in its last fiscal year, showing its emphasis on selling.', '“Make it easy to do business. Make it easy to buy a platform,” said Manny Medina, CEO of sales software start-up Outreach and member of the Amazon team that started what became AWS. “Sell me a vision. Good old salesmanship -- you need a little bit of Keith Block in that organization.” Block joined Salesforce from Oracle in 2013 and was elevated to co-CEO alongside Marc Benioff before he resigned in February 2020.', 'Medina said it would be helpful if AWS could sell customers technology even if it’s not quite available yet -- a sales tactic that Oracle has employed in the past. “If you want to grow, you have to make promises for things that you don’t yet have,” one former Oracle employee was quoted as saying.', 'Medina also said Selipsky could make a difference if he can make AWS simpler for users. This week a small cloud-infrastructure provider called DigitalOcean, which touts the simplicity of its services and billing practices, debuted on the New York Stock Exchange.', 'Selipsky will have to contend with a resurgent Microsoft.', 'When Selipsky left Amazon, Microsoft was still bolstering its portfolio with Azure services to match what Amazon could deliver, and Microsoft was still rolling out data centers around the world to boost capacity. Those are not big issues anymore. Microsoft has become more successful at convincing longtime Windows and Office customers to try Azure, in part by encouraging its salespeople to focus on getting customers to use it, instead of just pay for it.', 'Since 2016, Microsoft has also begun using Amazon’s own behavior against it. Microsoft executives regularly say that companies don’t want to do business with a IT services company that competes with them in other arenas -- a jab at Amazon’s continuous expansion from e-commerce into shipping, pharmacy, grocery stores and more.', 'Selipsky will have to respond to that line of inquiry, just as Jassy has. (Amazon has said that “for customers who’ve built meaningful offerings with significant functionality, we’ve yet to see these companies struggle to keep growing simply because AWS offers something in that area, too.”)', 'Whatever Microsoft is doing, it’s working. Azure now appears to be close to eclipsing Office as Microsoft’s largest business by revenue. IDC estimates indicate that AWS lost market share in the first half of 2021 compared with the first half of 2020, while Microsoft gained share. Alibaba and Google took share as well.', 'Microsoft has been assembling bundles of products and coming up with enhancements designed for individual industries, such as health care, manufacturing and retail. Amazon has not pursued a vertical-specific strategy to date. AWS has won some business in slow-moving areas, such as financial services and health care.', '“I do think there’s an opportunity for Adam to break through on some of that as part of a vertical strategy,” said Ed Anderson, a distinguished analyst at technology research company Gartner. For example, AWS could stand to capture more dollars from industries that have been slow to adopt the public cloud, such as financial services and health care.', 'His history at Salesforce will help here, too, as the company went deeper on its own industry push while Selipsky was there.', 'International expansion is another opportunity. Selipsky will be stepping into an Amazon that still isn’t always the go-to cloud outside the Americas. Alibaba remains dominant in China, and across Europe AWS has yet to become a big hit.', '“European companies tend to be a little more conservative and less open to disruption and change,” Anderson said. Europe has many smaller organizations that work with channel partners and like to continue to use products they’re familiar with, Anderson said.', 'There is also the matter of building up new relationships inside an ever-widening Amazon.', 'Since Selipsky left, Amazon’s headcount has more than doubled to about 1.3 million.', 'At least Selipsky will find familiar faces when he rejoins AWS in May. He was involved in many key business wins, including arrangements with Capital One and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, Heglar said. He was talented at growing leaders inside AWS and was willing to step in to defend his people in meetings when others were pushing back on their ideas, Heglar said. His daughter, Nina Selipsky, works at AWS as an executive content and program specialist.', 'Most importantly, Jassy trusts Selipsky.', '“He will let Adam do his thing,” Heglar said.', 'WATCH: Amazon names next AWS CEO as Adam Selipsky']"

Strategists from Goldman Sachs predict that the S&P 500 will round out 2021 at 4,300 points, which would reflect upside of 14%.

For BofA Securities’ Justin Post, the move only reaffirms his bullish thesis, with the analyst maintaining a Buy rating. Along with the call, he kept the price target at $150.', 'According to Post, the acquisition is expected to add 625,000 square feet of U.S. manufacturing capacity to Peloton, adding on to its existing capacity in Taiwan. “This capacity is likely underutilized today due to the pandemic, and is expected to come online for Peloton products by next Holiday,” he commented.', 'Further explaining his take on the deal, Post stated, “In our view, Precor may have been looking for a buyer given financial pressure on gym and other customers in 2020, creating an opportunity for Peloton. We see Precor’s equipment as relatively high quality, and a good fit for Peloton to both build US manufacturing capacity for Holiday 2021, and to help establish a presence in new commercial markets.”', 'It should be noted that Post doesn’t believe the purchase will be a solution for near-term supply constraints, but it could help limit future shipping risks.', 'The bottom line? PTON has improved its position in the market in 2020 and is on the path to reach 25 million subscribers, in Post’s opinion.', 'TipRanks shows that Post is ranked #31, backed by a 76% success rate and 33% average return per rating.', 'For Raymond James analyst Aaron Kessler, purchase intent-driven marketing company TechTarget remains a top pick after it announced its acquisition of BrightTALK, a marketing platform for webinars and virtual events in the enterprise IT market. In a bullish signal, the five-star analyst increased the price target from $48 to $68 and reiterated a Buy rating.', 'In 2020, BrightTalk is expected to generate revenue of $50 million, with over half of this coming from long-term contracts. Additionally, its 2020 adjusted EBITDA could come in at over $10 million, according to estimates.', '“We believe the acquisition is highly complementary given BrightTALK’s proprietary first-party purchase intent data, addition of virtual event capabilities to TTGT platform, cross selling opportunities, and increases TTGT long-term subscription revenues,” Kessler opined.', 'Online events are likely here to stay, in Kessler’s opinion, and while the company used to have an events segment, it didn’t launch a virtual events platform. “The addition of video/ webinar content to TechTarget websites should also help attract more users and better positions TTGT’s ~140 websites going forward,” the analyst explained.', 'All of this puts TechTarget on track to generate higher Q4 revenues/EBITDA, with Kessler now calling for $43.4 million, up from $42.6 million.

In addition, he set a $160 price target.', 'Horan had previously downgraded the stock in August 2019 given the “risk of rising churn from network and customer migrations.” That said, the analyst is now singing a different tune as the company’s performance has exceeded his expectations, with a very minimal response from its competitors as they try to maximize free cash flow.', 'On top of this, Horan originally thought the Sprint merger would be challenging in terms of integration and cause churn to increase. However, he notes that the “execution has been seamless.” The company has already realized $1.2 billion in synergies in 2020, with the analyst estimating this figure will double next year.', 'It should be noted that T-Mobile owns 50% of the sub 6GHz spectrum, but it only controls 30% of the wireless market. This should even out with the C-Band auction, in Horan’s opinion, but this “will take several years and this spectrum is inferior to its 2.5GHz.”', '“TMUS is building the only true 5G network on 80MHz of this spectrum, giving it a two-year-or-so market advantage from a 10x improvement in speed.

', 'So he turned to the laser cutter in his garage. ', 'Malek is the founder of a company that sells custom air fresheners for Teslas, and he figured he might be able to use his fabrication skills to help with the protective personal equipment, or PPE, shortages that are putting medical professionals and patients at risk.', 'A respiratory therapist he knew through the Tesla community said he could help Malek create a design that medical pros could use. After he gave the green light, Malek produced 2,500 face shields, and shipped the first boxes this week to hospitals that have asked for donations, including Children’s National in Washington, D.C. He’s put his business on the back burner for the moment to focus on PPE.', '“I had an epiphany, if our health-care workers start reducing in number it’s going to be catastrophic for everyone,” Malek said. “I realized I could have greater impact if I focused on the health-care pros on the frontline.”', 'Individual makers and small groups are mobilizing during this crisis because of a dire lack of PPE across the country, which has waves of doctors and nurses asking for help.', 'In California, officials stockpiled 21 million face masks for emergencies, but many of them were expired. California distributed the masks to frontline medical workers anyway. In New York City, the center of the outbreak in the United States, Mayor Bill DeBlasio said this week that New York has only enough N95 masks to last through the end of the week. The federal government is asking agencies that might have stashes of spare medical supplies to redistribute them to hospital staffs and emergency responders as the national stockpile runs low. ', 'Hospitals and governments have set up websites to take donations of PPE from the public, often asking for face shields specifically in addition to masks and gloves. Arash has an intake form on his website and he says he has been surprised by the number of medical workers asking for face shields. ', 'Face shields are gaining favor because they use materials that are easy to obtain and can be made quickly. At its most basic, a face shield is a piece of clear, non-porous plastic to protect health workers’ faces from coming into direct contact with saliva droplets that may contain the virus.', 'Face shields are supposed to be worn in conjunction with other PPE, like surgical or N95 masks, and can make them last longer. That means the shields don’t need to be made to strict medical-grade specifications.', '“The overall specifications to build those are not going to be as stringent as a face mask or respirator,”  said Dr. Sanjay Kurani, medical director at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center. ', 'Santa Clara Valley Medical Center worked with a Sunnyvale, California, nonprofit called Maker Nexus to create a face shield design that can be used at the hospital and reproduced in large quantities. The supplies are critical given that one COVID-19 patient might require doctors and nurses to use 30 sets of PPE per day on that patient alone, Kurani said. ', 'Santa Clara County in California was one of the first places in the U.S. to report community-spread coronavirus cases, and it’s been watching its PPE supplies closely. It’s under a shelter-in-place order until May 3 and there are currently 277 hospitalized patients in the county that are diagnosed with or suspected to have COVID-19.', 'The hospital has an infection prevention team evaluating PPE donations, and the staff appreciates the help. ', '“It has surprised us to the point where people are almost in tears that there are others supporting us and what’s happening while we’re socially distancing,” Kurani said. “To feel connected to the community this way is a huge morale booster.”', 'Maker Nexus typically provides machining tools for its members to fabricate new prototypes, but under shelter-in-place they’re using 3D-printing to produce face masks, and making the design public. Maker Nexus cofounder Jim Schrempp said that the effort from people with fabrication skills reminded him of WWII-era “victory gardens,” when the government encouraged people to grow their own food to help with supply.', '“Demand for PPE has ballooned, and the response is happening all over maker spaces,” Schrempp said, adding that if demand for face shields falls because there’s enough supply, there are additional ideas and requests for PPE that the organization would love to make. ', 'Getting help from medical professionals to optimize the face shields is a critical step in the process. Schrempp said that their design went through seven or eight iterations to make it safer, including lengthening the shield, limiting attachment points, and adding a top covering.', 'Organizations with greater capacity are mobilizing, too. Gustavo Fontana, an industrial designer who cofounded Fresco Design, said that he’s been working with a group called Ushield, which has found a factory in the Northeast that can produce as many as 100,000 face shields per day from readily available plastic. His first “pilot run” shipment of 4,200 shields went out to hospitals across the country this week.', '“Every day you can get an extra shield faster to a worker, it’s potentially lifesaving for that person,” Fontana said. ', 'Now, big firms with corporate expertise in supply chains and manufacturing are getting involved making face shields as well. Apple is making 1 million face shields per week, and its design comes with professionally made usage guidelines and assembly directions. Ford has donated face shields to Michigan hospitals as well as the New York police and fire departments. Nike is using materials originally intended for sneakers in its face shield design that’s being shipped to hospitals in Oregon. ', 'The little guys don’t mind the big companies joining in on the mobilization effort — to them, the point is to help out the health-care workers on the frontlines who are fighting the outbreak and incurring personal risk. In fact, many makers said, expensive techniques available to big firms such as injection molding could result in better shields at a large scale. ', '“People are expecting big companies like Apple to step up, and that’s great, but collectively we’re all in this together and everyone can do something,” Malek said. ']"

The people declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.', 'Yet as Flournoy, who built a tough reputation while working for former President Bill Clinton, exerts her power as a gatekeeper to the vice president, several of Harris’ allies outside the federal government are struggling to get their calls returned after years of regularly being in touch with her, some of these people said.', 'A person familiar with Flournoy’s handling of incoming communication with these associates says she sometimes starts a conversation asking, “What is it that you want from the vice president?” If the person wants to just say hello and have a brief conversation, Flournoy says that time will come at future private events.', 'If a person wants to speak to Harris about where she stands on policy, Flournoy will, at times, say they can’t speak to the vice president about policy and will make an introduction to one of her policy advisors.', 'Some of these same advisors and donors are trying other routes, including by attempting to speak with Douglas Emhoff, the vice president’s husband. Many of those calls have yet to be returned, these people said.', 'Chiefs of staff, especially those in the highest echelons of government, are expected to run a tight ship for their bosses, including by limiting who gets in the door for meetings or who reaches them on the phone. In the vice president’s world, some allies can get in — but they guard their status so they don’t run afoul of Flournoy. ', 'For instance, an influential Democratic donor who raised money for Harris’ failed bid for president recently tried to reach out to the vice president and had yet to receive a call back. Then this person decided to contact Flournoy. ', 'That didn’t work. The donor reached out to a fellow Democratic financier for Flournoy’s contact information. But the fellow financier declined to share Flournoy’s email address for fear of losing access themselves.', 'Another Harris supporter said she hasn’t heard from the vice president since a call with supporters during the transition period.', 'While Flournoy has made it tougher to get in touch with Harris, some of the vice president’s supporters accept it as a consequence of Harris building out her portfolio. Harris recently made her first visit as vice president to the U.S.-Mexico border, she touted Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill and is expected to have a role working on criminal justice reform, among other items.', 'One person close to Harris said they appreciated what Flournoy is doing and has accepted that it’s simply going to be harder to get in touch with Harris now that she is vice president and begins working on big-ticket initiatives.', '“There’s no question she [Flournoy] is a strong chief of staff and there’s no question that she is very focused on making sure that the VP is able to be focusing on the coronavirus pandemic and getting people vaccinated, the border, voting rights,” said another Harris ally who has spoken to Flournoy. ', '“So by making sure that she is able to focus on what she’s being charged with, there could be people who are not necessarily getting access because the chief of staff is prioritizing those tasks for the VP over political outreach,” this person explained.', 'A spokeswoman for Harris did not respond to a request for comment.', 'Flournoy has deep roots in Washington, D.C., and is a veteran of the mainstream Democratic establishment.', 'In the latter half of the 1980s, she worked as a law clerk for Julia Cooper Mack, a judge on the D.C. Court of Appeals, before jumping into politics, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.', 'CRP also says she later had stints as a counsel for the Democratic National Convention, as a leader on Clinton’s transition team after he was elected in 1992, and then as counsel for the former president’s office of presidential personnel.', 'Flournoy is listed as general counsel for cigarette maker Phillip Morris in a 1995 White House press advisory naming Kennedy Center advisory committee members. Later, she served as traveling chief of staff for Sen. Joe Lieberman during the 2000 presidential campaign, when he was Al Gore’s running mate.', 'After working on Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign for president, she became assistant to the president for public policy at the American Federation of Teachers, an influential union. Flournoy was originally connected to Harris by Minyon Moore, who was an assistant to Clinton when he was president. Moore, who didn’t respond to a request for comment, was once named as one of the 100 most powerful women in Washington.', 'Before she became Harris’ chief of staff, Flournoy led the staff working for Bill Clinton starting in 2013. At that post, Flournoy oversaw a staff of approximately 10 people who worked directly with Clinton, and had regular engagement with the Clinton Foundation, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.', 'While Flournoy was chief of staff, Clinton held an infamous tarmac meeting with then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch while his wife ran for president in the 2016 election. Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server was being investigated at the time by the FBI, which is part of the Justice Department.', 'Flournoy’s style working for Harris is familiar to people who knew her while she worked for Clinton. She took over managing access to Clinton after the departure of his longtime right-hand man, Doug Band. Band, who co-founded corporate consulting firm Teneo, is known for helping create Clinton’s post-presidential life, including assisting in launching the foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative.', 'According to a report by Vanity Fair, Clinton and Band interacted with some controversial celebrities and executives, including the late Jeffrey Epstein, who later died by suicide in prison after being arrested for child sex trafficking.', '“If you look at Doug’s tenure, it ranges from Epstein to others,” a person with direct knowledge of Flournoy’s work told CNBC.', '“If you look from 2013 through about a year and a half ago when Tina was here, you can’t point to any single one of them being here [Clinton’s orbit]. I call some of those people who were once around ‘the unsavory humans,’” this person added.', 'Clinton praised the hiring of Flournoy in a tweet after Harris made the official announcement. A spokesman for Clinton did not respond to a request for comment.', 'Band did not respond to a request for comment.']"

It also saw its distribution costs rise as shipping became more expensive.', 'Despite these headwinds, the privately held Danish toymaker reported revenue for the year that topped 43.7 billion Danish krone, or about US$6.99 billion, up 13% compared with 2019.', 'Top sellers ranged from classic Lego sets to themed products from Nintendo’s Super Mario and Disney’s Star Wars, Christiansen said.', '“Our research does show that more families are building together,” he said.', 'While the pandemic may have encouraged consumers to buy more Lego sets to pass the time in lockdown, Christiansen said, it’s not the only reason sales were so strong during the year. The company is reaping the benefits of investments in its e-commerce business and new markets.', 'The number of visits to Lego.com last year doubled from the year prior, as many of Lego’s physical stores were forced to temporarily close. Customers had already been gravitating more to online shopping, but the coronavirus outbreak has accelerated the trends and it likely won’t be reversed.', '“I’m not sure it’s going to go back,” Christiansen said.', 'Lego is ramping up recruitment for its digital and tech teams, Christiansen said. The company ultimately wants to be able to develop products at a faster pace and create platforms to house Lego content and for integrated play.', 'Still, traditional stores remain a key part of the brand’s strategy. In recent years, the toymaker has made a push into the Chinese market, opening dozens of physical locations.', 'While Lego has been part of the culture in other regions such as the U.K. and the United States, parents in China did not grow up with the iconic colored blocks. And so, having places where kids can go and get their hands on the bricks and see the sets that can be built has been a boon to sales.', '“Kids get to see what Lego is and play with it,” Christiansen said. “It’s a brand built on the physical.”', 'In 2020, Lego opened 134 retail locations, 91 of which were in China. The company currently has 678 Lego branded stores globally and has plans to add 120 more, including 80 in China. The aim is to have around 300 Lego stores in China by the end of 2021.', 'China is already one of the company’s best markets, boasting double-digit growth in the last year.', 'Christiansen said that sustaining the strong growth of 2020 won’t be easy but that the company is well-positioned to continue being a dominant force in the global toy industry.', '“I wouldn’t bet on 21% again, but what I do think is if we continue our long-term investments, then I believe we have the chance to outperform the market and take share,” Christiansen said.']"

The stock climbed about 5.3% after hours.', 'Here’s how the company did: ', 'Amazon, like many other retailers, was caught off guard by an influx of online orders during the pandemic, which resulted in logistics bottlenecks and supply chain shortages. The company’s one- and two-day delivery services were hampered with delays, marking a rare disruption in its normally speedy shipping operations. Amazon said online grocery sales tripled year-over-year in the second quarter and it increased grocery delivery capacity by more than 160%. ', '“This was another highly unusual quarter, and I couldn’t be more proud of and grateful to our employees around the globe,” Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement. ', 'As the pandemic wore on, consumer demand shifted away from consumables and groceries, categories that aren’t “super profitable” for the company, and toward a more normal mix of products, Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky told CNBC’s Deirdre Bosa. Amazon was also able to “ship a lot more,” Olsavsky said. ', 'One- and two-day shipping have since recovered somewhat but are “probably considerably behind the going in rate before any of this happened,” Olsavsky said on a call with analysts. ', 'The company was able to secure additional capacity in its fulfillment centers to absorb demand, pulling “capacity we didn’t think we’d need until 2021,” Olsavsky said. Still, demand continues to skyrocket, while Prime subscribers have been shopping more often and buying more products with each order, he added.', 'Amazon is focused on making more room in its fulfillment centers as it prepares to head into the peak holiday shopping season in November. Additionally, its Prime Day shopping event, which typically occurs mid-July, will now take place in the fourth quarter, aligning with the early October guidance it sent third-party sellers. ', 'Earlier this month, Amazon said it would institute quantity limits for product shipments from third-party sellers that use its U.S. warehouses, as part of an effort to make sure there’s enough space to store goods. ', '“As we move into Q3, we need to build more inventory for Q4,” Olsavsky said. “We’ve got our hands full on that challenge, but we’ve got a really good team that’s been working very hard probably since late February on this issue.”', 'As online orders continue to roll in, the company faces another challenge inside its warehouses. Tensions have been growing between Amazon and warehouse workers nationwide, with employees claiming the company hasn’t done enough to protect them from catching the coronavirus. ', 'Amazon said it expects to spend more than $2 billion during the third quarter on additional coronavirus-related  measures, including procuring personal protective equipment, deep cleaning its facilities and wage increases for employees, among other things. Last quarter, Amazon said it would spend all of its estimated $4 billion profit between April and June on similar efforts.', 'For the third quarter, Amazon said it expects net sales to come in between $87 billion and $93 billion, representing year-over-year growth between 24% and 33%. The company anticipates a range of an operating income of $2 billion and $5 billion, which factors in additional coronavirus-related investments. ', 'Amazon’s cloud-computing unit, Amazon Web Services, reported revenues of $10.81 billion for the quarter, up 29% year over year, but decelerating slightly from the 33% growth it reported in the first quarter. Cloud services like Amazon’s have become crucial to organizations during the pandemic as many of their employees have shifted to remote work. However, with companies looking to cut costs as a result of the broader economic downturn, Amazon, Microsoft and Google have all seen cloud revenue growth slow down year over year. ', 'Amazon’s “other” category, which is primarily made up of its advertising business, generated $4.22 billion in revenue, up 41% year over year. Subscription services, which includes revenue from Prime memberships, were up 29% year-over-year to $6.02 billion.', 'Third-party sales grew 52% year-over-year during the quarter, outpacing growth in Amazon’s first-party sales, which increased 48% year-over-year.

Amazon, like many retailers, found itself grappling with a logistical nightmare at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, as its warehouses became quickly overwhelmed with online orders at higher levels than it typically sees during the holiday shopping rush. Clark helped Amazon navigate through the dual crises of delivery delays and rising tensions with warehouse workers who called for greater safety protections. ', 'Both Wilke and Clark are members of Bezos’ S-Team, a tight-knight group of over a dozen senior executives from almost all areas of Amazon’s business, such as retail, cloud computing, advertising and operations. The S-team rarely sees its members depart and if they do, their roles aren’t always replaced.

And it will be my last.', 'In December 1999, I left work most evenings – along with most of my colleagues from the half of a floor of Key Tower that housed the entire corporate operations team – to head to the Seattle Distribution Center to pack boxes and gift wrap presents.  We also traveled to our buildings in Nevada, Kentucky, and Kansas.  I always packed flannel shirts for these trips to colder parts of the country.  Our main purpose was to ensure we shipped all customer orders in time for the holiday.  But we benefitted in other ways from these visits.  We got to see how the physical operations connected to our digital store, and I got to personally inspect our safety culture.  We made new friends (and a few of these friendships led to marriages).  And, perhaps most importantly, we gained enormous respect for the dedication and customer focus of our fellow employees who worked away from headquarters.', 'A few years later – with the help of an operational excellence focus built on Lean, statistical process control, a clear understanding of our bottlenecks, and purpose-built software – we didn’t need to send corporate employees out to fulfillment centers (FCs) to add much-needed bandwidth supporting our associates.  Everyone cheered our improving operational capability, but I noticed something was lost.  Holiday conversations in our frugal, but comfortable, Seattle offices increasingly turned to holiday parties and eggnog, and away from the stories of FC heroics.  I didn’t hear the same sharing of respect for the work being done in our FCs, and I was committed to reconnecting corporate employees to operations.', 'We created Customer Connections so that every new employee spent time in an FC or Customer Service.  I doubled down on representing our Operations team in the corporate environment, including starting every meeting with a safety tip.  And I started to wear my flannel shirts every day of Q4.  The flannel gave me a chance to talk about our operations and remind everyone of how dedicated and customer-focused our colleagues in the field were, too.', 'COVID-19 has pulled me back to my roots in operations as I work with the teams building antigen testing capacity, which we’ll deploy first to our front-line employees.  I’m so proud of the dedication our people have shown as they pick, pack, ship, and deliver to hundreds of millions of customers around the world who depend on us.  These employees deserve every ounce of our attention to ensure their safety, which is why we’ve spent so much time and money to keep them healthy and safe.  This testing work is very much in the spirit of flannel, and is the latest example of our commitment to the people in our fulfillment centers.', 'I’m planning to retire in Q1 of next year.  I don’t have a new job, and am as happy with and proud of Amazon as ever.  I treasure the deep relationships we forged as we grew this company.  From Jeff Bezos and my S-team colleagues to the hundreds and hundreds of leaders throughout Amazon who apply our Leadership Principles every single day.  We worked hard.  And we had a blast.  So why leave?  It’s just time.  Time for Dave Clark to step in and lead the organization as CEO Worldwide Consumer.  Time for Russ Grandinetti and Doug Herrington to expand their already considerable influence on our company’s culture and performance.

We hit it off right away.  I was so impressed with her leadership experience, technical acumen, and especially her dedication to the workers on the shop floor.  She wasn’t wearing flannel, but I was sure we shared the same instincts.  She’s off to a great start running Global Customer Fulfillment.', 'I met Dave Treadwell during our freshman year of college.  He was already way better at writing code than I was.  After spending nearly 30 years rising through the senior ranks at Microsoft, I asked him if he might consider joining Amazon. He was intrigued, and I jumped at the chance to hire him.  “Tread” has led our eCommerce Foundation tech teams since he joined Amazon, driving huge architectural change through Rolling Stone and our transition to native AWS, along with a significant improvement in our infrastructure costs.  Dave has an unusual mix of deep technical acumen and empathetic leadership, and he’ll be a great add to the S-team.', 'I didn’t hire Dave Clark.  Our MBA recruiting team brought him on board months before I joined.  But soon after my arrival at Amazon, I knew he was special.  He possessed a unique mix of raw intellect, systems thinking, sharp wit, and tons of leadership courage.  I tested him.  I “asked” him to go to Tokyo to start up our first Japanese FC (which he did after getting his first passport).  I “asked” him to go to Campbellsville, KY, to take a Senior Manager role.  I hoped that one day Dave might be my successor leading Operations, but I knew he would need significant plant leadership experience to complete his mental models.  After helping to dramatically improve the operations in Campbellsville, I asked him to take the General Manager role at our Delaware FC.  The operations there were relatively simple, so the leadership challenge was more about leading people than optimizing process.  Dave excelled again.  From there, Dave returned to Seattle to stay, assuming various roles in Operations that included designing our next generation FCs.  Seven years ago, he took over leadership of WW Operations and joined the S-team.  Dave thinks and leads boldly.  He’s the Big Thinking energy behind the scale of Amazon Robotics, our Prime Air fleet, and AMZL deliveries.  In the last two years, we moved Prime, Marketing, and the Stores organizations to Dave, giving him a chance to broaden his leadership beyond operations.  Dave is now ready to lead WW Consumer, and I’ll be proud to turn it over to him early next year.', 'We have an important holiday season ahead as customers will be depending on us more than ever.  We have so much to do in the coming months, so I’m not leaving yet.  After this holiday season, we’ll have time for Chime high fives and socially distant thank-yous and goodbyes, and I’ll cherish each of them.', 'Thank you for caring about our customers and about each other.

The companies did not provide financial details, but it will add to billions in already announced investments.', 'Toyota Motor on Monday also said it plans to invest about $3.4 billion (380 billion yen) on automotive battery development and production in the United States through 2030, including a new $1.3 billion battery plant.', '“The 10s of billions of dollars that are being invested by most of the big automakers over the next five to 10 years on making the transition to electric, the last thing they want to do is be stuck without key components that they need whether it be batteries or chips,” said Guidehouse Insights principal analyst Sam Abuelsamid. “They are increasing going vertical in some cases or diversifying their supplies in other cases.”', 'The announcements Monday come after Ford Motor said last month it will invest more than $11.4 billion in new U.S. facilities that will create nearly 11,000 jobs to produce electric vehicles and batteries, including twin lithium-ion battery plants in central Kentucky through a joint venture with SK Innovation.', '“Due to Covid and now the reaction to the semiconductor shortage, our government and companies are looking to onshore,” said James Lewis, a senior vice president with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, which works with automakers. “Car companies in particular don’t want to get caught out again the way they were caught out on chips.”', 'Following Tesla’s lead, General Motors could be next to produce it’s own battery cells and packs in the U.S. Through a joint venture with LG Energy Solution, the Detroit automaker is scheduled to begin cell production at an Ohio plant next year. The plant is expected to be the first of at least four, including another announced in Tennessee, in the coming years.', 'There are 27 battery facilities, including cells and packs, that have been announced or are currently operating in the U.S., according to the Center for Automotive Research.', 'Separately from the battery plant announcements, iPhone maker Foxconn, which is preparing to produce EVs, on Monday said it plans to produce electric cars and buses for auto brands in China, North America, Europe and other markets.', 'The Taiwanese company last month announced it will purchase an Ohio factory from embattled EV start-up Lordstown Motors for production of a vehicle for the company as well as EV start-up Fisker.', '“This is the wave of the future,” Lewis said. “This is a modernization of our auto industry.”']"
147,A brewing U.S.-China tech cold war rattles the semiconductor industry,2020-09-18T13:11:32+0000,"['As trade tensions mount between the U.S. and China, the U.S. semiconductor industry fears a tech cold war could disrupt the global supply chain. Now companies on both sides of the Pacific are trying to develop strategies to mitigate risk — whether it’s hoarding supplies or looking at shifting the location of production facilities.', ' Last week Trump administration announced that it is considering imposing export restrictions on Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, China’s largest manufacturer of semiconductors. That’s the latest crackdown by Washington as it tightens restrictions against Chinese tech companies such as Huawei, preventing them from obtaining chips without a special license.', 'The issue prompted SEMI, an industry group, to draft a letter for Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross explaining how blacklisting SMIC could hurt the U.S. tech industry, Reuters has reported. “We urge the Department to carefully consider the immediate and long-term detrimental impacts to U.S. industry, economic and national security that may result from the addition of SMIC to the Entity List,” said the group, which has 2,400 members worldwide, including SMIC and U.S. chip equipment makers Lam Research Corp  and Applied Materials.', 'While some U.S. firms such as Intel and Micron Technology still make chips in the United States, the industry’s center of gravity has shifted to Asia, where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) has more than half of the overall market for contract manufacturing chips and an even stronger hold on the most advanced chips. Firms, including iPhone maker Apple, Qualcomm and Nvidia all rely on TSMC and other Asian foundries to manufacture their chips.', 'Untangling the global supply chain in this interconnected industry is not feasible – at least in the foreseeable future, industry experts concur. Components for a chip could travel more than 25,000 miles before completion and can cross borders more than 70 times before a final product is delivered to the end customer, explains Syed Alam, Accenture’s global semiconductor practice lead.', 'Industry sources believe the best way to address the issue is to bring back more domestic manufacturing, develop a robust industry ecosystem, invest more in R&D and maintain America’s lead in advanced product design. An amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act shows Washington recognizes that boosting domestic manufacturing and R&D is key for national security and global competitiveness. The U.S. share of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity has been cut in half to just 12% over the past 20 years and is forecast to fall to 10% by 2023. ', 'The amendment was a compromised version of two bills that have bipartisan support. The CHIPS for America Act which stands for “Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors,” creates a 40% investment tax credit for semiconductor equipment, a $10 billion fund to match any chip manufacturing incentive programs at the state level, and $12 billion in R&D funding to be allocated over the next five to 10 years.', 'In addition, it provides support for semiconductor-based research grants to U.S. universities or private companies, either directly or through agencies like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). It also calls for the creation of a National Semiconductor Technology Center, which could serve as a clearinghouse and organizational control point for U.S.-based chip manufacturing, as well as a critical new research and development facility.', 'The other bill was the American Foundries Act, which authorizes the Department of Commerce to offer $15 billion in grants to states to assist in  the construction, expansion, or modernization of microelectronics fabrication, assembly, test, advanced packaging, or advanced research and development facilities. It also would give $5 billion in federal investments to promote semiconductor research at the Department of Defense, National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The bill also mandates that the White House Office of Science and Technology, in coordination with federal research agencies and the private sector, develop a plan to guide funding for advancing next-generation semiconductors.', '“We believe these grants and incentives are critical for the U.S. semiconductor industry especially for state-of-the-art advanced technology,” says Jeff Rittener, chief government affairs office at Intel. “We need help from the U.S. government to create a level playing field.” As he explains over time U.S. manufacturing stateside has been shrinking and that puts the country at risk since America will be reliant on foreign sources on the brains that run modern technology.', 'These incentives are key considering chip factories can cost up to $15 billion to build, with much of the expense in the form of pricey tools. China and many other countries have spent billions of dollars bolstering their domestic chip manufacturing industry and they offer tax and financial incentives to lure foreign manufacturers. In the Made in China 2025 Plan, the Chinese government has committed $120 billion to shore up domestic semiconductor manufacturing with the goal of producing 70% of all chips need for local consumption.', 'According to a recent report from the Semiconductor Industry Association in partnership with the Boston Consulting Group,  robust federal incentives valued at $50 billion would create as many as 19 major semiconductor manufacturing facilities and 70,000 high-paying jobs in the U.S. over the next 10 years. Strengthening U.S. chip manufacturing will help ensure America out-innovates the world in the strategic technologies of the future — AI, 5G, quantum computing — that will determine global economic and military leadership for decades to come. ', '“The country that leads in advanced chip research, design, and manufacturing will have a big leg up in the global race to deploy new game-changing technologies, such as 5G, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing,” said John Neuffer, president and CEO of the Semiconductor Industry Association. “Leaders in Washington should seize this opportunity, level the global playing field to attract chip production, and invest boldly in domestic manufacturing incentives and research initiatives that will strengthen U.S. tech leadership for decades to come.” ', '“The U.S. has always had a tremendous lead in thought leadership and intellectual property in the semiconductor industry but now China poses a real threat since they are subsidizing a tremendous amount in R&D,” says Bob O’Donnell, president and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research. Chinese government is currently making aggressive subsidized investments in building over 60 semiconductor manufacturing plants (commonly called foundries or “fabs”, which is short for fabrication sites).', 'Some companies are mulling over how to expand operations in the U.S. According to Rittener, Intel is investing in expanding at its locations in the U.S.  It has hired 3,000 new employees and is getting ready to open a new microprocessor plant in Chandler, Arizona.', '“Intel has also had conversations with the U.S. government about developing a foundry for advanced semiconductors,” Rittener says, “but there are no concrete plans yet.”', 'Other industry titans have already taken action. In May, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. – a big supplier for Apple and Huawei -- announced it was investing $12 billion to build  a second U.S. manufacturing plant in Arizona. The factory will be focused on producing so-called 5-nanometer chips, the latest in semiconductor technology being manufactured today. Construction will begin next year;  it’s expected to be operational in 2024.', 'For Huawei, the world’s biggest smartphone maker, the trade war has taken a toll. The company, which bought $20.8 billion worth of chips last year, has been hoarding chip supplies because of U.S. sanctions and gradually shifting design and chip production to mainland China.', 'The U.S. has accused Huawei of building backdoors into network infrastructure, ostensibly to aid Chinese government spying efforts, which Huawei has denied. Despite those denials, the Trump administration placed Huawei and 114 of its affiliates on its Entity List in May 2019, which meant US firms were unable to sell technology to the company without explicit US government approval. Since then the entity list has grown to include 150 companies. in May, the US Commerce Department issued an amended export rule to block shipments of semiconductors to Huawei to “strategically target Huawei’s acquisition of semiconductors that are the direct product of certain US software and technology.”', 'That rule prevented foreign manufacturers of semiconductors who use American software and technology in their operations from shipping their products to Huawei unless they first obtained a license from the US. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world, reportedly halted orders for Huawei’s HiSilicon unit in May following the new U.S. rule.', 'Now industry observers worry about any retailiation from China. “Given such sanctions significantly impact Huawei, there could be retaliation from China,” said Sebastian Hou at CLSA, according to Ars Technica. He named Apple, Huawei’s competitor in the smartphone market, and Qualcomm as potential targets.', 'Others industry titans continue to diversify operations in other parts of the globe. Last week, Nvidia announced a $40 billion deal to buy Arm Holdings from SoftBank. Arm designs the architecture for mobile chips used in almost every mobile device in the world, from the Apple iPhone to just practically every Android device. For Nvidia, whose chips are widely used to support graphics and artificial intelligence applications, including for self-driving vehicles, the deal will help boost its data center business.', 'While large manufacturers have the financial wherewithal and industry connections to navigate through disruptions in the supply chain, many small and mid-size tech manufacturers in the U.S. do not.', 'One is Social Mobile, a Miami-based consultancy and OEM that specializes in making customized Android Enterprise devices for Fortune 500 companies. The company, which also has operations in San Francisco, Hong Kong and Shenzhen, China, started seeing disruptions from suppliers in February and the situation is getting worse.', ' “There has been a shakeup in the industry,”  says CEO Robert Morco. “There are longer lead times for procuring semiconductors and prices have also risen. In some cases it takes double the time to get supplies. Some suppliers are only making them available for key clients. That has forced many companies to go to the grey market for chips.”', 'According to Morcos, “the big guns will get through this, but it’s harder for small and medium-sized businesses. We are feeling the impact of this trend the most. We are the ones that are being affected by a lack of transparency, price gauging and the lack of product availability.”', 'To navigate the crisis, Morcos says Social Mobile is asking customers to place orders early due to delays. Looking ahead the company is looking at building a plant in the U.S. with some sort of government support. “There is a lot of local, state and federal interest in onshoring semiconductor manufacturing right now, so we feel we are in the right place at the right time,” says Morcos.', 'O’Donnell notes that many of his clients are looking at U.S.-China trade and geopolitical tensions and its making semiconductor companies nervous. “There is a lot of saber-rattling going on right now between China and Taiwan,” he notes.', '“This has tech companies in many industries rethinking their semiconductor roadmap,” says Alam. As he explains, the U.S. just doesn’t need to build more chip plants, it needs to build an entire semiconductor ecosystem and attract the talent it needs to maintain the industry’s competitive edge.', '“It would be great to bring more manufacturing home,” says Gene Sheridan, CEO of Navitas Semiconductor, a start-up in El Segundo, California, that manufactures next-generation gallium nitride power chips in Taiwan and the Philippines for companies like Lenovo, AUKEY and Anker.', '“Trade tensions as well as the pandemic reminds us of the inherent risk of manufacturing mostly abroad.”', ' ', ' ']"
148,China is kicking out more than half the world’s bitcoin miners – and a whole lot of them could be headed to Texas,2021-06-15T18:12:28+0000,"['China has long been home to more than half the world’s bitcoin miners, but now, Beijing wants them out ASAP. ', 'In May, the government called for a severe crackdown on bitcoin mining and trading, setting off what’s being dubbed in crypto circles as “the great mining migration.” This exodus is underway now, and it could be a game changer for Texas.', 'Mining is the energy-intensive process which both creates new coins and maintains a log of all transactions of existing digital tokens. ', 'Despite a lack of reserves that caused dayslong blackouts last winter, Texas often has some of the world’s lowest energy prices, and its share of renewables is growing over time, with 20% of its power coming from wind as of 2019. It has a deregulated power grid that lets customers choose between power providers, and crucially, its political leaders are very pro-crypto – dream conditions for a miner looking for a kind welcome and cheap energy sources.', '“You are going to see a dramatic shift over the next few months,” said Brandon Arvanaghi, previously a security engineer at crypto exchange Gemini. “We have governors like Greg Abbott in Texas who are promoting mining. It is going to become a real industry in the United States, which is going to be incredible.”', '2021 data for the global distribution of mining power is not yet available, but past estimates have shown that 65% to 75% of the world’s bitcoin mining happened in China – mostly in four Chinese provinces: Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Sichuan and Yunnan. Sichuan and Yunnan’s hydropower make them renewable energy meccas, while Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia are home to many of China’s coal plants. ', 'The drawdown in miners has already begun in Inner Mongolia. After failing to meet Beijing’s climate targets, province leaders decided to give bitcoin miners two months to clear out, explicitly blaming its energy misses on crypto mines. ', 'Castle Island Ventures founding partner Nic Carter says that while it’s not totally clear how China will handle next steps, a phased rollout is likely. “It seems like we’re going from policy statement to actual implementation in relatively short order,” he said.', 'The way this exodus is measured is by looking at hashrate, an industry term used to describe the computing power of all miners in the bitcoin network.', '“Given the drop in hashrate, it appears likely that installations are being turned off throughout the country,” continued Carter, who also thinks that probably 50% to 60% of bitcoin’s entire hashrate will ultimately leave China. ', 'Although China’s announcement hasn’t been cemented in policy, that isn’t stopping miners like Alejandro De La Torre from cutting their losses and making an exit.', '“We do not want to face every single year, some sort of new ban coming in China,” said De La Torre, vice president of Hong Kong-headquartered mining pool Poolin. “So we’re trying to diversify our global mining hashrate, and that’s why we are moving to the United States and to Canada.”', 'One of bitcoin’s greatest features is that it is totally location agnostic. Miners only require an internet connection, unlike other industries that must be relatively close to their end users. ', '“The cool thing about bitcoin that is underappreciated by a lot of the naysayers is that it’s a portable market; you can bring it right to the source of energy,” said Steve Barbour, founder of Upstream Data, a company that manufactures and supplies portable mining solutions for oil and gas facilities.', 'That said, the exodus won’t be instantaneous, in part, because it will take miners some time to either move their machines out of China or liquidate their assets and set up shop elsewhere. ', 'Because miners at scale compete in a low-margin industry, where their only variable cost is typically energy, they are incentivized to migrate to the world’s cheapest sources of power. ', '“Every Western mining host I know has had their phones ringing off the hook,” said Carter. “Chinese miners or miners that were domiciled in China are looking to Central Asia, Eastern Europe, the U.S. and Northern Europe.”', 'One likely destination is China’s next-door neighbor, Kazakhstan. The country’s coal mines provide a cheap and abundant energy supply. It also helps that Kazakhstan has a more lax attitude about building, which bodes well for miners who need to construct physical installations in a short period of time. ', 'Didar Bekbauov runs Xive, a company that provides hosting services to international miners. Xive also sells the specialized equipment needed for mining. ', 'Bekbauov says that he’s stopped counting the number of Chinese miners who have called him to ask about relocation options, ranging from operations with 15 rigs to thousands. ', '“One miner told us that only government electricity plants have restricted mining and private ones will continue to service miners,” Bekbauov told CNBC. ', '“But most of the electricity is generated by government power plants, so miners will have to move. That makes them uncertain and desperate to find other locations,” he said.', 'Whether Kazakhstan is a destination or simply a stopover on a longer migration west remains to be seen. ', 'Arvanaghi is bullish on North America and thinks the hashrate there will grow over the next few months.', '“Texas not only has the cheapest electricity in the U.S. but some of the cheapest in the globe,” he said. “It’s also very easy to start up a mining company ... if you have $30 million, $40 million, you can be a premier miner in the United States.”', 'Wyoming has also trended toward being pro-bitcoin and could be another mining destination, according to Arvanaghi.', 'There are, however, a few major limitations to the U.S. becoming a global mining destination.', 'For one, the lead time to build the actual physical infrastructure necessary to host miners is likely six to nine months, Carter told CNBC. “The U.S. probably can’t be as nimble as other countries in terms of onshoring these stray miners,” he said.', 'The move logistics may also prove difficult. There is a shipping container shortage, thanks to the tail winds of the Covid pandemic. ', 'But perhaps the biggest question is the reliability of the Texas power grid. A storm that devastated large swaths of the state in 2021 has reignited a debate over whether Texas should winter-proof its systems, a potentially costly project that might affect taxes or other fees for those looking to tap into the state’s power grid. More recently, ERCOT, the organization that operates Texas’ grid, asked consumers to conserve energy amid what officials called an unusual number of “forced generation outages” and an upcoming heat wave.', 'Tesla CEO Elon Musk has bashed bitcoin mining, claiming that it is bad for the environment. It’s not a new criticism.', 'For years, skeptics have maligned the world’s most popular digital token for polluting the planet, while supporters have extolled the virtues of bitcoin and its role in accelerating the rise of renewable energy. ', 'It is unclear whether the China mining exodus will make or break the case for bitcoin enthusiasts in the debate around the token’s carbon footprint. The dominant narrative, to date, has been that much of the world’s bitcoin is mined with Chinese goal. ', '“From a narrative perspective, it’s definitely an improvement,” said Carter. “But China also has the most abundant stranded hydro resources in the world.”', 'The country offers significant energy vectors from wind, solar and especially hydropower in the south. Xinjiang’s grid, for example, is 35% powered by wind and solar energy inputs.If all the miners do end up leaving China, it will mean less fossil fuel-powered mining, but it will also mean that the network’s share of renewable energy-powered mining will drop. This is why the question of where these migrant miners end up could prove critical to bitcoin’s future. “It’s the biggest story of the year for bitcoin,” said Carter. ', 'De La Torre says they’re looking to expand operations using green energy, a trend that is already years in the making. He says that hydro plants are generally cheaper than fossil fuels in most parts of the world.', '“Mining is price sensitive, so as to seek out the lowest cost power and the lowest cost power tends to be renewable because if you’re burning fossil fuels...it has extraction, refinement and transport costs,” explained Blockstream CEO Adam Back. ', 'Each year, investment bank Lazard releases a breakdown of energy costs by source. Its 2020 report shows that many of the most common renewable energy sources are either equal to or less expensive than conventional energy sources like coal and gas. And the cost of renewable power keeps going down.', 'But there are limitations to running crypto mines purely on renewable energy.', 'Though solar and wind are now the world’s least expensive energy sources, both power supplies face limitations at scale, so there is concern over the viability of miners turning exclusively to wind or solar energy.', 'For the time being, there isn’t that much mining capacity worldwide that is ready to absorb the Chinese miner diaspora. While they scramble to find a new home, we could see hashrate go offline – and stay offline. ', 'In practice, that would mean all the remaining miners are more profitable for a period of time. ', 'Having more geographic dispersion would even out the global balance of power, and it would also reduce the ability of any one sovereign nation to co-opt or control the network.', 'We may also see special crypto economic zones pop up in the next few months.', '“You will see jurisdictions adopting a very favorable stance and creating the equivalent of special zones to encourage miners to host locally,” said Carter. “We’re seeing it at the state level here. You’re also going to see it at the country level, you might even see subsidized electricity for mining.”', 'Correction: A storm devastated large swaths of Texas in 2021.

Cohen is the co-founder and former CEO of e-commerce company Chewy, which he built up and sold to PetSmart in 2017 for $3.35 billion. Cohen remained CEO following the acquisition until March 2018, and in June 2019, Chewy went public at a valuation of $8.7 billion. This is Cohen’s first 13D filing, but what he lacks in activist experience he makes up for in strategic and operational qualifications in building and running a company in the digital era, giving him a ton of credibility here, even more so than the average activist with respect to certain areas.', 'On Nov. 16, 2020, Cohen sent a letter to the company’s board, urging them to immediately conduct a strategic review and to provide stockholders with a credible and publicly available roadmap for cost containment, prioritizing profitable retail locations and geographic markets and building the e-commerce ecosystem.', 'Cohen resorted to this public letter because his private attempts were not productive. GameStop sells video games and consoles and has been bearishly compared to Blockbuster. Cohen does not make that direct analogy, but he certainly paints the picture of a company that is on that same path if it does not change.', 'Sales have declined from $9.5 billion in fiscal year 2011 (before the last console cycle) to $6.4 billion in fiscal year 2019; EBITDA has dropped from $839 million in 2011 to only $111 million in 2019; net income has fallen from $339 million in 2011 to a loss of $470 million in 2019; and in the two most recent quarters alone, the company lost another $277 million. All of this happened while the size of the global gaming market has grown by more than 2.5x since the last console cycle. Cohen sees a company that is stuck in a brick-and-mortar mentality and is unwilling to embrace the digital mindset necessary to grow with gamers.', 'However, Cohen also sees a company with valuable assets, including a strong brand and large customer base and a path to success and shareholder value. He believes the company can be the ultimate destination for gamers, but that destination must start with a strong e-commerce platform that provides competitive pricing, broad gaming selection, fast shipping and a truly high touch experience that excites and delights customers, including content and community. It needs to become the Amazon of gaming, with the added expertise and specialized customer service as a key differentiator.', 'To do this, Cohen urges the company to cut excessive real estate costs, streamline or sell non-core operations in Europe and Australia and hire the right talent. While Cohen does not specifically target CEO George Sherman, he does note that Sherman has substantial experience working for large brick-and-mortar retailers such as Advance Auto Parts, Best Buy and Target and is committed to a twentieth century focus on physical stores and walk-in sales despite the transition to an always-on digital world.', 'The company is at an inflection point to make this change. Cohen notes that the company will be able to temporarily mask some of its issues with the new console cycle that will appear to validate its adherence to an outdated business model that is overdependent on brick-and-mortar sales. However, it is also this new console cycle and additional sales that can provide the cash flow to finance this strategy change into the future as the global gaming market is expected to reach $174.9 billion this year and $217.9 billion by 2023. ', 'Cohen alludes to the fact that one board seat would not be acceptable to him as he wants the company to actually focus on a shift in mindset. This would require at least two — and probably three or more — new directors to the ten-person board, depending on who is replaced. While it looks like Cohen might have an ally on the board in James Symancyk, the CEO of PetSmart while Cohen was running Chewy, Symancyk also has a brick-and-mortar background and might not see it the same way Cohen does.', 'If this does end up going to a proxy fight, Cohen seems like the type of shareholder who will take it the distance if necessary. In that case, he would have two potential headwinds. First, the company recently added four new directors through settlements and nominations by shareholders. That could be enough to placate certain institutional shareholders and ISS if they do not see as dire of a situation as Cohen does in this ultra-fast-moving industry. Second, a large part of the shareholder base is comprised of index funds such as BlackRock (12.12%), Vanguard (8.12%) and State Street (4.0%), who are reluctant to back an activist without the cover of an ISS or Glass Lewis recommendation.  However, what is interesting here is there is an unusually high short interest, with approximately 90% of the shares in lending programs, so we don’t really know who has loaned their shares, who can vote them and who can recall them before the meeting.', 'It will be interesting to see if the board will be able to stomach the change necessary to propel GameStop into the 21st century. In the words of former U.S. Army General Eric Shinseki: “If you don’t like change, you’re going to like irrelevance even less.”', 'Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments']"
