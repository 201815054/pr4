1,"The world could be on the brink of an energy crisis rivaling the 1970s, says IHS Markit’s Yergin",2022-03-03T15:12:45+0000,"['Russia’s Ukraine invasion could have set in motion an energy market disruption on the scale of major oil crises in the 1970s, according to Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit.', 'Moscow is one of the world’s largest oil exporters. Sanctions by the U.S. and allies on Russia’s financial system have already set in motion a backlash against Russian crude from banks, buyers and shippers.', 'Yergin, also an author and energy market historian, said even though Russian energy was not sanctioned by the U.S. and other countries, there could be a large loss of Russian barrels from the market. The country exports about 7.5 million barrels a day of oil and refined products, he noted.', '“This is going to be a really big disruption in terms of logistics, and people are going to be scrambling for barrels,” Yergin said. “This is a supply crisis. It’s a logistics crisis. It’s a payment crisis, and this could well be on the scale of the 1970s.”', 'He said strong communications between governments imposing the sanctions and the industry could head off a worst-case scenario. “Governments need to provide clarity,” Yergin said.', 'He noted that members of NATO receive about half of Russia’s exports. “Some share of that is going to be disrupted,” Yergin said.', 'Yergin said there are “de facto” sanctions working to keep Russian oil from the market, even though energy was not specifically sanctioned. Buyers are wary of Russian oil because of pushback from banks, ports and shipping companies that do not want to run afoul of sanctions.', 'JPMorgan estimates that 66% of Russian oil is struggling to find buyers, and that crude prices could reach $185 by the end of the year if Russian oil remains disrupted.', '“This could be the worst crisis since the Arab oil embargo and the Iranian revolution in the 1970s,” Yergin said. Both events were major oil shocks in that decade.', 'In 1973, Middle Eastern oil producers cut off supply from the U.S. and other Western countries in retaliation for assisting Israel during the Arab-Israeli war that year. Oil was immediately in short supply, and Americans lined up at gas stations to buy skyrocketing gasoline. The other shock was the result of the 1978-1979 Iran revolution, which led to the overthrow of the Shah of Iran.', 'Oil majors, like BP and Exxon Mobil have said they are exiting Russian ventures. The price of Russia’s Ural crude has fallen sharply, compared with the international benchmark Brent crude.', '“What we haven’t seen before is the big reputational issue as well, companies not wanting to do business with Russia,” said Yergin. Oil companies are giving up major investments, where they may have spent years developing operations and employed hundreds of people in Russia.', '“Vladimir Putin in a week has destroyed what he spent 22 years building, an economy that was basically integrated with the global economy. Now what’s happened is Russia is unplugged from the global economy,” he said.', 'Yergin said the disruption is coming when the market is already tightly supplied. OPEC+, an alliance between OPEC, Russia and others, decided Wednesday to continue their current production plans. They are returning about 400,000 barrels a day to the market each month until they reach their target in June.', 'Also adding to the pain for Russia’s customers has been the spike in European natural gas prices. Europe is the biggest customer for both Russian oil and gas.', 'Oil prices were already rising when Russia rolled its tanks into Ukraine last Thursday. Brent was trading above $116 per barrel Thursday before backing off amid speculation that Iran may reach a deal to reenter its nuclear deal. That could bring 1 million barrels of Iranian oil back to the market.', 'Industry analysts say it is difficult to tell how much Russian oil will be affected. The White House said while there are no sanctions on energy, they are on the table.', 'IHS Markit hosts the annual CERAWeek energy conference in Houston next week. Executives from many energy companies, including Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Total, Occidental Petroleum and ConocoPhillips, will be speaking, and a major topic at the conference is expected to be how Russian barrels will be replaced.', '“I think you’re talking about losing 2 to 3 million barrels a day,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital. Bank of America has estimated that for every million barrels lost from the market, the price of Brent could rise by $20 per barrel.', 'Kilduff said he expects Russian pipeline oil to continue to flow to China. Beijing said it will not join sanctions against Russia.', 'Analysts have said crude that is carried by ships is more likely to be wanting for buyers.', '“This time we’re cutting off the oil ourselves. It’s a self-inflicted embargo,” said Kilduff. “It’s a buyers’ strike this time, not suppliers acting out. ... If you can’t finance it and you can’t get it paid for there’s no way the Russians are going to sell it.”']"

3,In this corner: IPO deluge pits Alibaba vs. JD,2014-05-20T12:50:34+0000,"['  Alibaba vs. JD.com: which one will investors choose to own?', '  The announcement that GoPro has filed for an initial public offering (IPO) caused a flutter of  excitement after the close yesterday (they’re profitable!). However, a more heavyweight IPO battle is shaping up between two Chinese  e-commerce giants.', '  While everyone is waiting for Alibaba to announce pricing terms  (more on that below), its rival JD.com is set to go public  this week.', 'The latter is looking to price Wednesday night on the NASDAQ, and it’s a big fish: JD is the largest online  direct sales company in China. The market cap is roughly  $23 billion, and they’re looking to price 93.7 million shares  at $16—$18, the midpoint of which is a $1.6 billion offering. Most IPOs are in the $100-$200 million range.  ', '  It would be the third biggest IPO of the year, after Ally  Financial’s $2.375 billion and Santander Consumer USA  at  $1.8 billion. This is not a pleasant rivalry between Alibaba and JD.com. They are bitter enemies.', '  How bitter? Here’s a list of JD.com’s underwriters: Bank of America/Merrill Lynch & UBS. Meanwhile, Alibaba’s enlisted the following list of Wall Street luminaries: Credit Suisse,  Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley.', '  Notice something: there’s no overlap. Every major  underwriter is represented, but you are either on one team or the  other — not both. That’s not a coincidence.', '  So which one do you want to own?  Though both are Chinese e-commerce companies, there are notable  differences between the two, even on a superficial level.', '  JD.com is a more Amazon-like. They have built out a very  sophisticated fulfillment infrastructure. They take  possession of much of the merchandise and ship it out. They  don’t just sell other people’s stuff, they sell goods themselves  to customers. This involves big inventory risks, of course.', '  Alibaba doesn’t do it that way: they have a marketing  platform for many different companies. Their revenue comes  from fees they charge companies to have products on their platform.  ', '  JD.com’s revenue pool is also much narrower. Roughly 82 percent is from electronics  and appliances, according to Renaissance Capital. That is a  very low margin business! ', '  Another difference between the two is that Alibaba has its own  payment system, while JD does not.', '  The profit picture is also very different.  JD has $11  billion in revenues, and is roughly break-even in profits  (they’re supposed to make money this year).  In this way,  it’s very similar to its American rival Amazon, which is also  barely breaks even. And we are not talking about a startup:  JD has been around since 2004. By contrast, Alibaba appears to have roughly $8 billion in  revenues on a yearly basis, and nearly $4 billion net profit. That’s a nearly 50 percent profit margin.', '  Here’s my point: what would you rather own, a company that  is growing revenues with nearly zero profit margins, or a company  that’s also growing revenues fast with a 50 percent profit  margin? Now you understand the level of excitement over Alibaba.', 'There’s another problem for JD.com, and to a lesser extent for  Alibaba:  it will have to fit into a portfolio manager’s  portfolio, and investors already have plenty of technology sector names. Investors only have room for so much tech, and this  is a very crowded sub-space:  tech e-commerce.  ', '  My point is that investors will not only have to decide if they  want to own JD.com with Alibaba, they may also have to decide if  they want to sell other e-commerce holdings.   ', '  Of course, there is room for expansion of tech holdings, but it’s  not infinite. Many investors are weighted at the same  levels that Russell weights sectors. There is a re-balancing this in June, where all their indexes will be overhauled;  that will likely reflect the higher market weights of technology. Still, Alibaba will not be in the Russell by then; it won’t go  in until September at the earliest, possibly December. ', '  The bulls say yes, there’s room for plenty of investors,  particularly hedge funds who may not worry as much about sector  holdings. They may be right: indications are that JD is  already several times oversubscribed. Yet that doesn’t mean it’s  going to have a big pop on the first day.', '  Bottom line: there is an awful lot of Chinese paper that is  coming to market relatively soon. There is always a price  at which deals can get done, but for these two the question is, what is that price?', '  While I’m on the Alibaba topic, there’s been a lot of questions  about when they will go public. Much of this is speculation, because there is a crucial issue  that is not answerable right now: how much scrutiny will  the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) give the company?', '  Normally, for a company of Alibaba’s size (over $1 billion in  revenues), the time frame for going public is typically two to  three months from the time they file until they set pricing terms. At that point, they will do a road show, and if  the reception is favorable, go public a week to a couple weeks  after that.', '  Alibaba filed on May 6th.  Two to three months would be  early July to mid August, which is the time frame most people are going with. But the path isn’t always so smooth. Look at JD.com:  they  filed in January, and didn’t announce terms until May 9th—that’s four months.', '  The SEC is reviewing the Alibaba prospectus now.  The  company will have to get SEC approval before they can announce  terms. When will that happen? While the company has provided some financials, they will likely  update them.  Once they do, the SEC will review them.', '  The betting is, the SEC has quite a lot of questions.   Here’s a few that are likely:', '  1) Provide more detail on revenue sources. Alibaba does not  break down their revenue contribution with much granularity.  So they talk about their consumer-to-consumer portal,  Taobao, but don’t provide a lot of numbers.  ', '  2) Who’s controlling the company?  There is a partnership  that is controlling the board, we know that some of them are  original partners. However, tthere are also other people in the  partnership and little, if anything, is known about these people.   The SEC will likely want to know more.', '  3) What else do they own?  Alibaba also is a minority  investor in many companies in China, like Weibo, the Twitter of  China, as well as other companies. They will likely ask for  more specifics.', '  Finally, not to make this more complicated than it already is,  but the ultimate decision of when Alibaba should go public may be  dictated by the stock market and the reception of IPOs, as well  as the economic news out of China...and so far the news is not  great.', '  The Renaissance Capital IPO ETF (IPO), a basket of roughly 60  recent IPOs, is just off the lows for the year.', '  There are seven Chinese IPOs this year, and the returns are not  encouraging. All seven were up on their first day of  trading (about 10 percent on average), but six of the seven are  still below their close on the first day, according to  Renaissance.', '  Take Jumei, the largest online beauty products retailer in  China, which went public May 15th at $22, now trading at $19.55.', 'Not encouraging!']"

', '  Because there are still so many second-tier and third-tier  cities, it’s still difficult for people to buy things, so they  are pushed to do most of their shopping online, Yeung said. ', 'But U.S. consumers are use to a different shopping experience as well as different buying incentives—like the Amazon Prime service, Cohen said. ', '  If Alibaba is going to edge its way into the U.S. market, it  would probably be better off if it did so through acquisitions  and investments instead of establishing its brand, Yeung said.  The Chinese retail giant would likely target its investments in  spaces that it’s familiar with, like other e-commerce companies.  It might also buy a shipping company, she  added.

8,"Live Black Friday: Macy’s mobbed, long lines creep",2013-11-29T19:05:00+0000,"['  The holiday shopping season kicked off much earlier this year, as  at least a dozen national retail chains from Macy’s to Gap to Target opened their stores on Thanksgiving  Day. Many people complained about the early start and the  mad rush for deals. In Rhode Island, volunteers set up a  coat-exchange program as an alternative to consumerism.', '  The day after Thanksgiving, called Black Friday, is typically the  biggest shopping day of the year. For a decade, it had been  considered the official start of the holiday buying season. But  in the past few years, retailers have pushed opening times into  Thanksgiving night. They’ve also pushed up discounting that used  to be reserved for Black Friday into early November, which has  led retail experts to question whether the Thanksgiving openings  will steal some of Black Friday’s thunder.', '  The holiday openings came despite threatened protests from  workers’ rights groups, which are opposed to employees working on  the holiday instead of spending the day with family.', '  (Read more: 10  must-have gifts for gadget lovers)', '  Overall, the National Retail Federation expects retail sales to  be up 4 percent to $602 billion during the last two months of the  year.

So he came up with the  idea of having people donate a coat or get one for free. The  state’s Buy Nothing Day coat exchange is now marking its 17th  year and has inspired similar events in Kentucky and Utah,  Gerritt said.', '     This year, 15 sites were set up around Rhode Island  for people to give or take a coat. The exchange on the lawn of  the Statehouse went through a few thousand coats last year.  Gerritt picked that site intentionally because it sits in the  shadow of the Providence Place mall.

9,"Is your company sending disaster aid? First, do no harm",2013-11-18T19:06:51+0000,"['  The announcements came almost like clockwork. Just days after  Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines, destroying entire  communities, companies and large organizations from FedEx to the NBA started pledging aid in  various forms, just as they have after other recent disasters.    ', '  This ought to be good news for the afflicted areas—and for  the companies involved. Certainly the assistance does much to  burnish a company’s image. But whether it provides a comparable  benefit to a stricken area is often another matter. ', '  Unsolicited donations of food, blankets and other supplies may  not match what is needed on the ground. Donated goods may pile up  on roadsides and in storage spaces that are already in short  supply, impeding the progress of workers from relief  organizations (NGOs) on the ground.  Even worse, if a  stricken area is hard to reach because of damage  to roads and airports, an influx of unsolicited goods can  make it harder for supplies that are actually needed to reach the  area.     ', '  “All the logistical resources in the areas should be geared  toward facilitating the flow of moving supplies that are exactly  what are needed at the moment,” said Jose Holguin-Veras, a  professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and an expert on  disaster relief. “Corporations and companies and groups should  think about the needs of the survivors, not about what might be  good for the company.”', '  Bob Ottenhoff, chief executive of the Center for Disaster  Philanthropy, agrees. When unsolicited donations of goods come  into a place like Tacloban, one of the worst hit communities in  the Philippines, “the airports can’t handle it, the roads  can’t handle it, the relief organizations can’t handle it,” he  said. “This is not a time for amateurs.” ', '  (Read more: How to help: Organizations offering relief to Typhoon  Haiyan survivors)', '  Sometimes, even identifying what’s needed isn’t enough. Companies  also need to think about the most effective way to get supplies  into victims’ hands. Donating actual goods may well be less cost  effective than giving cash to relief organizations on the ground  that can then buy the supplies locally, saving transportation  costs and giving the local economy a boost.', '  A case in point: Holguin-Veras recalls coming across  water donated from Spain when he traveled to Haiti after the  earthquake there in 2010.', '  (Read more: Global giving surges following Haiti quake)', '  “I showed it to one of the guys at the relief group, and he  wanted to cry,” Holguin-Veras said. “For every bottle  that came from Spain, four or five people were left without  water. If they had donated the cost of transporting that water,  you could buy five times that much water.”', '  By and large, major corporations have made substantial  improvements to their relief efforts in the past decade. When the  Indian Ocean tsunami struck in 2004, few companies had developed  relationships with NGOs, and their relief efforts were often ad  hoc. A review of the relief efforts found that tins of pork were sent to  Banda Aceh even though it’s heavily Muslim and Islam doesn’t  allow consumption of pork. Expired medicines and canned foods  also were donated. But since then, corporate disaster response  overall has become more strategic and organized, according to the  Center for Strategic & International Studies.', '  (Read more: Megastorms don’t care about your preparation)', '  Ottenhoff agrees that large corporations have made progress since  tarmacs in Indonesia were littered with unwanted supplies in  2004. “They probably have some people on staff who work full  time on this,” he said. “They probably have in place memos of  understanding or other relationship with disaster relief  organizations. Many make cash available. They’ve worked this out  in advance.”', '  FedEx, for one, has pledged aid to the Philippines in the form  of transport. It intends to fill an MD-11 aircraft  with supplies from Direct Relief International and Heart to Heart  International, NGOs that have worked with the company before, and  fly them into the afflicted areas.  ', '  Some companies have had help from initiatives like the Business  Civic Leadership Center, a part of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce  Foundation. The center was founded in 2000 as more companies were  making corporate social responsibility a part of their management  strategy. Gerald McSwiggan, the director of issue networks at the  center, says large companies have made particular strides. And  while he says it’s harder to track the efforts of small to  midsize businesses, anecdotally he hasn’t seen as many drives to  collect canned goods or similar programs. ', '  (Read more: Rethinking the way your company should respond to a  disaster)', '  The chamber recently held a conference call with several large  NGOs like the Red Cross about their aid efforts in the  Philippines, and roughly 75 businesses called in, McSwiggan said.', '  Still, even the smartest companies would do well to think about  disaster philanthropy more comprehensively, experts  say. McSwiggan recommends that companies do more advance  planning so they have a strategy in place before a disaster  happens. ', '  “We try to tell companies, ‘Disasters are not the time to hand  out business cards,’” he said. “You want those relationships  established with NGOs already. Small businesses should use large  NGOs and focus on cash donations. If you don’t have those  relationships built, don’t fund a start-up organization. Don’t  try to ship goods into the country. You’re not prepared to do  these things.”', '  Ottenhoff says companies need to think about the long haul when  they plan post-disaster donations. Assistance “still tends  to be focused on immediate relief,” he said. “What we still see  missing is sufficient resources being focused on planning and  preparation and mitigation before the disaster, and then a lack  of attention paid to long term recovery and rebuilding.”', '  (Read more: Typhoon was our ‘Black Swan:’ Philippine exchange  COO)', '  In the case of Typhoon Haiyan, the rebuilding could be extremely  prolonged. “Millions of people have fled their homes and are  living in temporary housing and getting emergency food and  clothing,” Ottenhoff said. “Will they be able to come back to  their homes or continue fishing or farming, or come back to their  small business? This is an issue that doesn’t get sufficient  funding attention.', '  “We’re not saying, ‘Don’t send money for emergency response,’ but  don’t forget about those people once they’ve been rescued.

Crusoe’s technology helps oil companies turn wasted energy, or flare gas, into a useful resource.', 'Similar to ConocoPhillips’ mining scheme in North Dakota’s Bakken region, Exxon is diverting natural gas that would otherwise be burned off into generators, which convert the gas into electricity used to power shipping containers full of thousands of bitcoin miners. Exxon launched the pilot in late January 2021 and expanded its buildout in July.', 'While Exxon hasn’t talked publicly about its work in the space, Eric Obrock, a 10-year veteran at the company, said on his LinkedIn profile that from February 2019 to January 2022, he “proposed and led the first successful commercial and technical demonstration of using Bitcoin Proof-of-Work mining as a viable alternative to natural gas flaring in the oil patch.”', 'Obrock’s title on his profile is NGL industry outlook advisor, referring to the natural gas liquids market. Obrock told CNBC through a LinkedIn message that he’s been advised that he can’t speak to the media on this topic. Exxon didn’t respond to a request for comment.', 'Exxon’s bitcoin project isn’t really about making money from the cryptocurrency. Rather, the company has pledged to reduce emissions as part of an industrywide effort to meet higher environmental demands. In early March, Exxon joined other oil companies in committing to the World Bank’s “Zero Routine Flaring by 2030” initiative introduced in 2015.', 'The type of crypto mining arrangement it’s pursuing with Crusoe reduces CO2-equivalent emissions by about 63% compared with continued flaring.', 'Exxon’s bitcoin mining work in North Dakota was first reported by Bloomberg, which said the company is also considering similar pilots in Alaska, the Qua Iboe Terminal in Nigeria, Argentina’s Vaca Muerta shale field, Guyana and Germany.', 'The problem Exxon and Conoco are addressing has existed for years: What happens when drillers accidentally hit a natural gas formation?', 'Unlike oil, which can be trucked out to a remote destination, gas delivery requires a pipeline. If a drilling site is close to a pipeline, producers can sell it right away. But if the pipe is full or if the gas is 20 miles away, drillers often burn it off. That’s why you typically see flames rising from oil fields.', 'In addition to the environmental hazards, drillers are also burning cash.', 'Enter bitcoin mining, which only requires an internet connection and can be done from anywhere. And because miners’ primary variable cost is energy, they’re incentivized to find the cheapest sources of power. ', '“This is just a great way to bring that demand to the wasted energy and solve two problems at once,” said Cully Cavness, president of Crusoe, whose backers include Valor Equity Partners, one of Tesla’s largest investors. “Solve the energy appetite of bitcoin and solve the stranded energy, flare gas problem for the energy industry.”', 'Cavness said Crusoe has 150 employees and works with Norway’s Equinor ASA, Canadian oil producer Enerplus and Devon Energy, based in Oklahoma City.', 'Permits from North Dakota’s Division of Air Quality show Crusoe can run 20 portable engines, with 11 currently in use at well sites across the state. Two of the engines are operational at wells run by XTO Energy, Exxon’s oil and gas fracking subsidiary, at the Jorgenson Deep Creek Site. Cavness said most of Crusoe’s 80-plus data centers are deployed in the Bakken.', '“We’re really moving the needle on flared volumes,” Cavness said. “More than 10 million cubic feet of gas per day that would be flared is not flared because we’ve deployed our systems.”', 'The World Bank, in its most recent Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership report, recognized Crusoe as offering an innovative solution to flaring.', 'The Bakken formation became an important source of new oil production in the U.S. in the last couple decades with the boom in hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.', 'Craig Thorstenson has been working at the permitting program at North Dakota’s Division of Air Quality since 1989. He says North Dakota has always been an oil state to some extent, but growth in the Bakken lifted the state to second in the country, before it slipped to third last year.', 'Thorstenson, who was born and raised in Bismarck, the state capital, said the change “was quite a shock for us.” Residential housing couldn’t keep up with demand.', '“We were having a population boom,” Thorstenson said. “People coming in, wanting to get jobs. People living in the Walmart parking lots.”', 'More drilling meant more wasted gas, which affected the entire Williston Basin that spreads across part of Montana, the Dakotas and into Canada. That’s a big reason why Crusoe invested heavily in the area.', '“At points in not-that-distant history, the basin was flaring almost up to a fifth of the gas that was being produced there,” said Cavness.', 'Thorstenson said the amount of wasted natural gas is finally trending lower. In a March report, North Dakota’s Department of Natural Resources estimated that currently 93% to 94% of natural gas is being captured. In 2014, the commission had a capture goal of 74%.', 'Drillers have historically chosen flaring as a way to dispose of excess gas because it’s less damaging to the environment than venting, which releases methane directly into the air and produces greenhouse effects that have proven to be 84 to 86 times as powerful as CO2 over a 20-year period.', 'Even with flaring, some methane does escape due to wind and other factors. On-site bitcoin mining can be especially impactful, because 100% of the methane is combusted and none of it leaks or vents into the air, according to Adam Ortolf, who runs business development in the U.S. for Upstream Data, a company that manufactures and supplies portable mining solutions for oil and gas facilities. ', '“Nobody will run it through a generator unless they can make money, because generators cost money to acquire and maintain,” Ortolf said. “So unless it’s economically sustainable, producers won’t internally combust the gas.”', 'Crusoe’s systems are built to make the process financially viable for drillers. The company brings its equipment onto the oil pad, allowing it to convert otherwise wasted natural gas into electricity, which then powers computing at the well site.', '“When we put it through our generator, we get up to 99.9% combustion of that methane,” Cavness said. “Not only are we using the otherwise wasted energy, we’re also significantly reducing methane emissions.”', 'Cavness said his main takeaway from the United Nations’ latest global climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, was that methane is the low-hanging fruit.', '“That’s the thing we want to solve as an energy industry,” he said.', 'WATCH: Texas crypto miners power down to ease grid pressure']"

As Monday’s highly anticipated report from the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change made urgently and desperately clear, global warming is an urgent threat to human welfare.', '“Nearly half of humanity is living in the danger zone – now. Many ecosystems are at the point of no return – now,” U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said on Monday. “Unchecked carbon pollution is forcing the world’s most vulnerable on a frog march to destruction – now.” ', 'Teetering on this precipice with climate change while simultaneously surviving the Russian and Ukraine war is generating a new framework for understanding the global energy markets.', 'A nation’s national energy policy is a cornerstone of its national security policy.', 'In Europe’s case, “it was staggeringly irresponsible to outsource gas storage to Gazprom,” said Steve Cicala from the National Bureau of Economic Research. Cicala focuses on the economics of regulation, and specifically on environmental and energy policy. Gazprom is the Russian energy giant that’s majority owned by the state.', 'Going forward, the EU “should be moving at the maximum possible speed to get themselves off of Russian gas,” Cicala said.  ', 'That does not mean energy independence is the benchmark.', '“The goal is security,” said David Victor, a professor of public policy at UC San Diego. “And security is not the same thing as independence.”', 'Energy independence means relying on national or local sources of energy. But even there, flexibility is limited if one of those sources is interrupted or runs out. A well-functioning global market is a better solution.', '“Security comes from diversity and diversity alone,” he said.', 'For Europe, being overly dependent on pipelines of Russian natural gas is the problem. The EU meets about 10% of its demand for natural gas domestically, and all the rest is imported, which makes it the largest importer of natural gas in the world, according to to the Directorate-General for Energy for the EU. Natural gas imported into the EU comes mainly from Russia (41%), Norway (24%) and Algeria (11%).  ', 'In the short term, the European Union is looking to increase its imports of liquid natural gas by tanker ship from the United States and Qatar, Victor said.', 'Europe is “actually raising important imports from different countries. And by having those imports available, that’s an option to them that improves security,” Victor said.', 'The EU has been reducing its dependence on coal to reach its climate goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 and cutting emissions by at least 55% by 2030.', 'In 2020, the most recent year data is available for, 32% of the EU’s energy came from oil and petroleum products, according to Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union. About 25% of the EU’s energy came from natural gas, 11% from solid fossil fuels, 13% from nuclear energy and 18% from renewables.', 'The focus on building out renewables is already significant, according to Aaron Praktiknjo, head of the energy systems economics at the E.ON Energy Research Center at RWTH Aachen University in Germany.', '“I don’t think that the EU should be faulted for not ramping up renewables faster,” Praktiknjo told CNBC. “Take Germany: In just about 20 years, the share of renewables in electricity consumption has risen by a factor of about 10 from about 5% to 50%. At the same time, electricity prices for final consumers have doubled mainly because of subsidies for renewables.”', 'A draft of a government policy obtained by Reuters on Monday found German leaders are looking to accelerate their transition to renewables, aiming to meet all its electricity needs with supplies from renewable sources by 2035.', 'Transitioning the EU’s energy grid will take physical upgrades and international coordination.', 'And also, it will require governmental intervention, a pill many current political regimes don’t want to swallow, according to Sir David King, a former U.K. climate change official who now chairs the Climate Crisis Advisory Group.', '“Some governments, and the current British government is one of them, don’t like regulatory behavior. We want to deregulate everything and allow the private sector to operate on a free basis. You can’t get this transition without regulatory behavior,” said King.', 'Lobbying from incumbent energy providers may contribute to the reluctance to regulate the energy industry, King said.', '“The United States has the biggest lobby system for the fossil fuel industry in the world,” King told CNBC. “The power of the lobby system in the United States has influenced other countries as well. So I think the incumbent is terrified of being put out of business.”', 'Another problem: Politicians don’t prioritize energy policy because many of their constituents have more pressing concerns, said Benjamin K. Sovacool, a professor of energy policy at the University of Sussex Business School.', '“While energy costs seem large in total, they are still a small percentage of overall household spending per month,” Sovacool told CNBC. “So, not as important a priority as mortgages, or university fees, or paying for cars. We spend thousands of pounds or euros on these every year, but only hundreds of pounds or euros on energy.”', 'Public surveys and polls have found that voters prioritize issues such as immigration, Covid-19 response, military spending, health, and the war in Ukraine, above climate policy and energy issues, according to Sovacool.', '“And no politician wants to be seen to increase energy prices in the short-term by investing in low-carbon alternates, even it pays for itself in the long-term, or benefits society later,” Sovacool said.', 'Nuclear energy production emits no greenhouse gases, but some constituents voice concern about the potential for accidents and the lack of a permanent disposal repository for nuclear waste, which is radioactive.', 'In a way, the Russia-Ukraine war will be like a Rorschach test for nuclear energy, Victor told CNBC, as Ukraine has 15 nuclear reactors, which the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been monitoring during the conflict.', '“People who are worried about nuclear will see in all the agitations around the Ukrainian nuclear complex in particular more reasons to be worried about nuclear,” Victor said. “And people who see nuclear as a part of the overall strategy for dealing with emissions and a way that that also reduces dependence on foreign suppliers are going to see in this a logic for keeping nuclear plants open and for building new nuclear plants in Europe.”', 'Sentiment about nuclear is often hard to shift, and the current moment is no exception, according to Victor. (He sees nuclear energy as an important part of decarbonization.)', 'Germany was getting about 25% of its electricity from nuclear energy until March 2011, according to the World Nuclear Association. Then German government passed a law to phase out nuclear power following the Fukushima accident in Japan.', 'Now, high gas prices and a lack of sufficient energy “should motivate Germany to restart its significant nuclear generation portfolio. Even if only in the short-run, this would help buffer the shock,” Cicala told CNBC.', '“The decisions to retire nukes were short-sighted and not enough consideration was given to how the shortfall would be made up. But that would’ve been true even without the risk of a supply interruption from Russia,” he said.', 'But Germany’s move is not necessarily a bellwether. The Czech Republic, France, Poland and the U.K. are pursuing new nuclear reactors according to John Kotek at the Nuclear Energy Institute. As Russia falls out of diplomatic favor, that gives American nuclear companies a foot in the door for European customers, Kotek said.', 'Russia has been “one of the strongest competitors for nuclear export because they would offer aggressive financing packages,” Kotek said. “Russia is really disqualifying itself from many of the opportunities that are going to exist in the in the free world in the over the coming decades because they’re just proving themselves to be an unreliable partner.”']"

It was not immediately clear whether Tesla would make similar changes to cars manufactured in or shipped to the U.S.', 'The omission indicates that Tesla had to make changes beyond what the company has publicly revealed to keep its factories and sales going from the final weeks of 2021 on, as the world faced an ongoing chip shortage that has affected everything from cars to laptop computers. It also means Tesla can’t turn all its existing cars into driverless vehicles with a mere software update, undercutting what CEO Elon Musk recently said on an earnings call:', '“My personal guess is that we’ll achieve Full Self-Driving this year at a safety level significantly greater than a person. So the cars in the fleet essentially becoming self-driving via software update, I think, might end up being the biggest increase in asset value of any asset class in history. We shall see.”', 'Internally, Tesla employees said that adding “level 3” functionality, which would allow a driver to use their Tesla hands-free without steering in normal driving scenarios, would need the dual electronic control unit system and therefore require a retrofit at a service visit. They also said that the exclusion would not cause safety issues, since the removed part was deemed a secondary electronic control unit, used mainly as a backup.', 'At the time this manufacturing change was underway in Shanghai, CEO Elon Musk wrote in a tweet: “Oh man, this year has been such a supply chain nightmare & it’s not over!”', 'Tesla has struggled with manufacturing challenges throughout its history, but the completion of its Shanghai factory in 2019 helped it increase production, expand margins, and gain market share beyond North America.

The company had a hard time obtaining “the little chip that allows you to move your seat back and forth,” he noted, along with other “basic chips.”', 'He did not mention the altered power steering systems.', 'Other automakers have taken similar steps, but typically make temporary cuts to options that aren’t part of a vehicle’s core functionality.', 'For example, in March 2021, General Motors said it was building some of its 2021 light-duty pickup trucks without a fuel management module, a move that hurt those trucks’ fuel economy. It blamed the chip shortage for the move.', 'Tesla currently offers several levels of driver assistance functionality in its cars. A basic version, dubbed Autopilot, comes with every car. Drivers can also buy a more advanced version, called Full Self-Driving, or FSD, for $12,000 or $199 a month (in the U.S.).', 'When Tesla made the decision to exclude an electronic control unit from its steering racks, there was an internal discussion about whether to notify customers, two employees told CNBC. These people asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak on behalf of the company.', 'Employees also discussed whether omitting the part would degrade any functionality in or reliability of customers’ cars. They worried whether the “depop,” or exclusion, of this component may interfere with customers’ ability to use FSD features.', 'Ultimately, they decided the tweak did not rise to the level of customer notification -- at least until Tesla is ready to launch “level 3,” or hands-free driver assistance features.', 'Tesla vehicles can still use the current “level 2” versions of its driver assistance systems, Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (or FSD), without the dual-control steering system.', 'But employees told CNBC if Tesla launches a more sophisticated FSD update, owners with the affected cars who use that premium system will need to get a steering rack retrofit from a Tesla service center.', 'Generally, Tesla relies on service technicians to install missing parts or to repair or replace broken parts, before a car is delivered to a customer, making service a kind of extended arm of Tesla manufacturing.', 'Most of the cars with the single electronic control unit were going to customers in China initially, where FSD is not seeing significant uptake. According to internal communications seen by CNBC, just over 1% of all Tesla customers in China opted for the premium driver assistance package at the time they placed an order for a new car.', 'More recently, tens of thousands of the affected vehicles were exported to customers beyond China, including in Australia, the UK, Germany and throughout Europe, employees told CNBC.', 'CNBC asked HWA Analytics’ Richard Wallace whether removing an electronic control unit from a power steering system in a modern vehicle could pose a safety risk.', '“If something like a chip or an ECU is not providing additional functionality, if it is truly redundant, you may be able to turn it off or leave it out. With chips and software, there’s a little bit of wiggle room. I can reassign stuff here and there,” he said.', 'Much depends on a vehicle’s computing architecture, said IHS Markit Senior Principal Analyst Phil Amsrud.', 'He said, “I cannot think of a case where an automaker would say ‘You know what? We’ll take a component out of that module, even though it was there for a good reason and we’ll hope nothing happens.’ Going from a dual chip to a single chip variant in a vehicle can make a system simpler and make it better in some cases. But they’d really need to do a lot of validation.”', 'Most automakers would spend 1,000 hours on testing or more to make any big changes, he estimated. That can take upwards of four months. It can also take years for quality or safety issues to become clear after changes are made.', 'Tesla employees told CNBC that the company spent less than a few weeks discussing the change before moving ahead and didn’t view it as a big deal -- more of a chip-famine survival tactic.', 'The company had previously produced earlier models that featured a power steering system with only one electronic control unit, and that gave them greater confidence. So too did Tesla’s frequently touted ability to push software updates “over-the-air” to vehicles to refine their functionality if needed.']"

You can say, ‘Well, that’s overnight. I’m sleeping. It’s no big deal,’” Sheridan said. “But there’s times when you don’t have 10 hours to get on the road.”', 'If that same new technology is used inside the electric car, the car’s range could be increased by close to 30%, or the size of the battery could be decreased by 30%, both advantages in their own way.', 'But we probably won’t see it in new cars until at least 2025.', 'Gallium is a chemical element on the periodic table and a natural by-product created in the refining of other metals, like aluminum. “For decades, there was no known use for this material,” Sheridan said.', 'But when gallium is combined with nitrogen into gallium nitride (GaN), it’s useful for the semiconductors that go into the charging units for consumer electronics devices. A GaN semiconductor operates up to 20x faster than silicon and makes it possible to deliver up to 3x more power and 3x faster charging in half the size and weight.', 'The technology is still relatively new, and not widespread yet because it’s still more expensive and requires customers to redesign their entire charging systems. But Sheridan explains that the cost will come down as scale increases.', '“Now, it’s only 10 to 20% more expensive. Within two years, it’ll be the same cost or cheaper,” he says. “It’s a powerful chip. But to do it right, you have to redesign the whole power system around that chip and that requires a lot of new skills.”', 'Navitas works closely with its customers to help them make those changes.', '“We actually are very hands-on with our customers. We create design centers — just for mobile chargers, just for data centers, just for EVs — to specifically help those customers design the entire next generation power system using our GaN chip, because we have experts on all the other stuff, not just the GaN chip, to help them do it. So there’s quite a bit of learning curve.”', 'In the last three years, Navitas shipped over 35 million units with its GaN technology to customers like Chinese smartphone brand and manufacturer Vivo, Dell and Chinese consumer electronics manufacturer Xiaomi.

Right now, that’s happening with silicon semiconductors. As the power travels from the battery to the wheels, 30% or more of the energy is lost in a transmission, Sheridan said.', 'If GaN superconductors are used in that transmission, then you can use a smaller battery or have the same size battery take a car further.', '“I can’t take all the energy lost to zero, but I can take a big chunk of that 30% of energy that’s wasted and save it by a more efficient technology in GaN,” Sheridan said.', '“If you think about what holds any buyer back from EV, it is still more expensive than a gas car because the cost of that battery, so anything you can do to use a cheaper, lighter weight battery” will be beneficial for brining the price down, Sheridan said.', 'Other reasons that consumers are hesitant to switch to electric vehicles is “range anxiety,” which could be helped by making the efficiency inside an electric vehicle better with GaN technology. “And then of course, you got the slow charging nature of this thing. It’s just not as fast as filling up a gas tank. And so we’re trying to close the gap on those three items.”']"

Moreover, pessimism is growing among shipping executives – some now expecting the disruption to continue even into 2023.', 'Until recently, consumers never needed to give a single thought to how the products they buy actually get to them.  No longer.  The spreading disruption of supply chains explains why on-line purchases are taking longer to arrive, why there’s vacant space on store shelves, and why the furniture you ordered is taking months instead of weeks to arrive. ', 'This disruption is one of the main reasons for the surge in inflation.  IHS Markit’s latest PMI survey of global manufacturing finds that the delays in delivery times are the most severe ever recorded, going back a quarter century.  This unprecedented situation is causing prices to rise at one of the fastest rates in a decade.', 'The disruption began with the economic upheaval of the pandemic.  But it is now being made worse by the strength of the economic rebound, a shortage of workers, and a transportation system that is overstressed.', 'At the heart of the shipping problem are more than 20 million metal containers. They carry about half of  world trade - everything from electronic goods and furniture to auto parts and seafood.', 'Over the last three decades, the global system has become much more complex and highly interdependent.

No longer able to spend money on services, but with household savings surging, they spent instead on household improvement and electronic goods, much of it ordered online.', 'The shipping companies and ports were not equipped to deal with the flood of containers.  The situation was made more difficult by the shortage of workers owing to Covid.   That is when ports began to clog up.', 'The economic rebound that began with widespread vaccinations has proved to be very strong. Delta variant notwithstanding, IHS Markit now projects 2021 global GDP growth of 5.7%, compared to the 3.4% decline in the Covid shut-down year 2020.  That has added to the pressure on the system.  Containers shipped from Asia have grown at a rapid rate each month since August of last year.  ', 'Previous disruptions to global shipping have been temporary.  Not this time.  Instead, it has been one thing after another.  In March, a huge container ship became stranded in the Suez Canal, disrupting trade flows between Asia and Europe.', 'Then Covid forced a partial shutdown of one of the world’s largest ports in China and then of China’s second largest container port. A major U.S. railroad suspended all container movements from the U.S. West Coast owing to a bloated backlog in Chicago.

Forty-nine container ships were idled at anchor off of Los Angeles/Long Beach as of Aug. 29, the most ever, and up from just nine on June 18. ', 'All of this disruption is cumulative. It comes as volumes continue to rebound due to the strong recovery.

A single container of goods that pre-pandemic cost $1,500 to ship from Shanghai to Los Angeles could cost as much as  $30,000 today. That additional cost is inevitably passed on.', 'Containers have become scarce.  They may be sitting unopened for a week or two and thus cannot be put to work for another shipment. There are no spare containers sitting idle around to fill the void.  Similarly, shipping capacity itself is effectively being reduced. Ships that have dropped anchor, while waiting two weeks to unload, have as a result also dropped out from the global system, instead of sailing off to their next port.', 'The problem is compounded on land by a worsening shortage of truck drivers.  Containers are now waiting two weeks in Los Angeles/Long Beach to be picked up, instead of the normal 3 or 4 days.  So severe is the shortage that trucking companies are offering $10,000 to $15,000 bonuses for new drivers.

Intricate patterns are created on the wafer where the light comes into contact with the chemicals, which are carefully laid out beforehand.', 'This process, which leads to the formation of the all-important transistors, is known as lithography. The machines themselves are called extreme ultraviolet lithography machines, or EUV machines.', 'Not every lithography system that ASML makes has EUV capabilities. EUV is the company’s latest technology which it introduced for high-volume manufacturing a few years ago. DUV (deep ultraviolet) is still the workhorse of the industry.', 'ASML sells the relatively rare EUV machines to a handful chipmaking giants including TSMC, Samsung and Intel. Each machine reportedly has over 100,000 components and it takes 40 freight containers or four jumbo jets to ship. Last year, ASML sold just 31 of these enormous pieces of equipment, according to its financials. It has sold over 100 in total.', 'The Trump administration even pressured the Dutch government to stop the sale of the machine to Chinese customers, Reuters reported last year. As a result, Chinese chipmakers have been unable to make the most advanced chips. The Biden administration has shown no signs of reversing Trump’s stance.', 'Chris Miller, an assistant professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, told CNBC that chipmakers want to use the narrowest wavelength of light possible in lithography so that they can fit more transistors onto each piece of silicon.', 'Transistors are one of the basic building blocks of modern electronics and they enable an electric current to flow around a circuit. Generally speaking, the more transistors you can fit onto a chip, the more powerful and efficient that chip will be.', '“The EUV light that ASML’s most advanced tools use has a wavelength of 13.5 nanometers, which lets you carve extraordinarily small shapes on silicon,” said Miller, who is in the process of writing a book about the history of the semiconductor industry.', 'The TSMC chips in the latest Apple iPhones, which were created with ASML’s EUV machines, have around 10 billion transistors on them, Miller added.', 'Beyond lithography, there are several other manufacturing processes that must be completed before a chip is ready for shipping. “Ultimately what you’re trying to do is build structures on the silicon using a mix of carving things out and depositing new chemicals onto it,” Miller said.', 'Given no one else can make EUV machines that are suitable for mass manufacturing, ASML has a monopoly on the segment and there’s no sign of anyone catching up.', '“ASML is absolutely critical to the entire semiconductor ecosystem,” Peter Hanbury, a semiconductor analyst at Bain & Co, told CNBC. “In some ways it’s just as important as TSMC.”', 'He added: “Every bleeding edge chip, starting at five nanometers, and going forward for likely a very long time, is going to be heavily reliant on ASML equipment.”', 'Semiconductor analysts believe it would take around a decade and billions of dollars for another company to get to a stage where it could start to compete with ASML.', '“ASML has around 4,000 suppliers that they’re aware of and their suppliers have suppliers as well,” said Miller.', 'Some of the key components in ASML’s EUV machines are particularly difficult to make.', 'The mirrors, for example, are made by German firm Zeiss in partnership with ASML and they’re the flattest structures humans have ever made.', '“These structures themselves are sort of marvels of engineering,” Miller said. Compared to normal mirrors, they’re relatively reflective, which is important because chipmakers don’t want photons to be lost before the beams of light come into contact with their wafers.', 'The hardest part of the EUV machine to make, however, is the light source, which has come a long way over the years. “Historically, they [chipmakers] just used a light bulb in the 60s and 70s,” Miller said. “Light bulbs don’t emit extreme ultraviolet light and it’s hard to get enough power [or] enough photons emitted.”', 'The light source in ASML’s EUV machine emits tiny balls of tin, about 30 microns wide, that are blasted twice by the world’s most powerful carbon dioxide lasers. The first blast “gets it ready” and the second, stronger pulse turns it into a plasma which is 400,000 degrees Fahrenheit in temperature, Miller said.', '“This plasma of exploded tin, if you will, emits photons of extreme ultraviolet light,” Miller said. “Making this process work took 30 years.”', 'ASML’s lithography machines are primarily made at a facility in the Netherlands, but there’s also a site in Connecticut where some modules are made. The modules then get sent to ASML’s headquarters in Veldhoven, a Dutch town that’s home to around 45,000 people and thousands of ASML employees, for full assembly.', '“It’s an insane process to ship them,” said Miller. “Then there’s a big learning process to get them up and running because the machines are so complicated. They’re not like an off the shelf, plug it in, turn it on and go. You need to be able to train the staff that are operating them.”', 'ASML staff are based inside the chip foundries where the machines get deployed, Miller said, adding that they monitor and tweak the machines whenever necessary. “There’s only a couple dozen of these machines in operation worldwide. They’re still learning how they actually work.”', 'Demand for ASML’s EUV machines and its DUV machines is soaring as chipmakers attempt to overcome a global crunch.', 'In September, ASML said it expects a sales boom over the next decade.

The company is planning to release a next generation machine called High-NA, which stands for high numerical aperture, around 2025.', '“It will allow even more specific etchings on silicon chips,” Miller said, adding that Intel has signed an exclusive (and probably very expensive) deal to get the first High-NA machines.', '“Unless you think that our demand for computing power is going to stagnate or decline, which doesn’t seem like a safe bet from my perspective, I think the expectation’s got to be that ASML’s revenue keeps growing,” Miller said.']"

Meanwhile, Amazon third-party sellers told CNBC they end up throwing away about a third of returned items.', '“Somebody has to pay for that,” said Micah Clausen, who sells party supplies and home goods on Amazon under a third-party store named Iconikal. “It’s falling back on either Amazon or the third-party seller. It comes out of their bottom line and inevitably makes prices go higher.”', 'UPS predicts the 2021 holiday season will see a 10% increase in returns compared to the year-earlier period, which translates into more waste — and expense — for all online retailers.', 'At the head of the pack, Amazon has received mounting criticism over the destruction of millions of items. Now the e-commerce giant says it’s “working toward a goal of zero product disposal.” Last year, it launched new programs to give sellers like Clausen new options to resell returns, or send them to be auctioned off on the liquidation market.', 'Liquidity Services consumer marketing manager Meredith Diggs explains one way e-commerce has normalized shopping habits that lead to more returns.', '“Wardrobing [is] where people will order the same thing in three different sizes to see which one fits and then they return the other two, not realizing that those other two most of the time don’t go back on that retailer’s shelves,” Diggs said.', '“Categories like apparel see really, really high return rates in the 10s of percents,” added Raunak Nirmal, who used to work at Amazon and now runs an Amazon aggregator, Acquco, with more than 40 third-party brands. His return rate is closer to 3%.', '“If it’s a new product, Amazon would allow that product to get resold on the listing as new, but it really needs to be in pristine condition for that to happen and that’s more rare than you would expect, even if the customer hasn’t used the product at all,” Nirmal said.', 'When an item can’t be sold as new, Amazon gives the seller up to four options for what to do with returns: each with a fee: Return to Seller, Disposal, Liquidation, or (by invitation only for now) Fulfillment by Amazon Grade and Resell.', 'With the Return to Seller option, the return leaves the Amazon warehouse for several more legs on a truck, plane or cargo ship. It heads back to the seller for further processing, then it could go off to another Amazon warehouse for sorting and repacking, then on to a new customer, who could always choose to return the item again.', '“You’re essentially forced to decide if you want to recall that inventory to your warehouse — which is an expensive process — repackage it yourself, and then ship it back into a warehouse to sell, which doesn’t make sense I would say 80% to 90% of the time. Or you could choose to dispose it,” Nirmal said.', 'Disposal is an all-too-common fate for returns from many of the biggest online retailers. In a statement, Amazon told CNBC, “No items are sent to landfill. We are working towards a goal of zero product disposal and our priority is to resell, donate to charitable organizations or recycle any unsold products. As a last resort, we will send items to energy recovery, but we’re working hard to drive the number of times this happens down to zero.”', '“Energy recovery” often means it’s burned.

And no matter what I put into the system, it said destroy the item. And that was kind of heart wrenching.”', 'Disposal of returns is a widespread practice in e-commerce. Luxury retail brands like Burberry have been criticized in the past for burning millions in unsold merchandise to protect their brands, a practice Burberry told CNBC it stopped in 2018. A Danish TV station reported H&M burned 60 tons of new and unsold clothes since 2013, a claim that H&M told CNBC was a misunderstanding. An H&M spokesperson said, “The products media referred to had been affected by mold or did not comply with our chemical restrictions.” Similar claims have hit Coach, Urban Outfitters, Michael Kors, Victoria’s Secret, and J.C. Penney.', '“It’s the easiest thing to do and sometimes certain brands do it because, you know, they want to protect their brand and they don’t want lesser valued items out there on the market,” Moore said.

It hopes to raise $308 million through the deal.', '“There have been very few solutions for this long duration up until now, and it’s largely driven from the fact that we didn’t rely on energy storage as a major solution for hardening the system,” said Dresselhuys, who became the CEO of ESS this year after decades of energy and technology executive experience.', 'The company launched in 2011 in the Portland, Oregon, garage of co-founders Craig Evans and Julia Song, who are a married couple as well as business partners.

Dresselhuys said the company has shipped products to two customers, with several more in the pipeline.', 'The company lost $245.3 million in the first six months of 2021, but operating losses were only $18.4 million; the remainder was due to losses on reevaluations of warrant and derivative liabilities. Operating losses were $17.4 million for 2021, and the company expects to record its first profit in 2023.', 'The big breakthrough for ESS is a long-duration iron flow battery built from readily available materials, said Carmichael Roberts, a co-chair of the investment committee at Breakthrough Energy Ventures.', 'In a battery, the electrolyte is the chemical medium that connects the two ends of a battery, the anode and the cathode. In ESS’ batteries, the electrolyte is made of iron, salt and water.', '“The flow battery is cheaper, safer and has better operational life than conventional lithium-ion storage,” Roberts said.', 'Making a battery out of iron, salt and water means “there’s no toxicity, the technology we build doesn’t start fires or doesn’t blow up in fire,” said Dresselhuys.', 'Also, ESS batteries do not have lithium or cobalt, two common elements in batteries that are being impacted by supply chain crunches.', '“Both are in potentially short supply globally, and none are produced in the U.S.,” said Jesse Jenkins, an assistant professor at Princeton University who specializes in the energy grid.', '“Lithium is less of an issue in the long run, as long as we recycle lithium-ion batteries, but there may be some short-run price increases as production ramps up to match battery demand for EVs,” Jenkins said.', '“Cobalt is a bit trickier and has come under fire for some of the supply chain relying on [so-called] ‘artisanal mines’ in Africa, which employ forced labor, and child labor in some cases, with people digging out cobalt by hand and very, very harsh conditions,” Jenkins said.', 'ESS also does not use vanadium, a chemical element used in some flow battery technology. While the element is promising, Dresselhuys says, it’s too expensive to be meaningful.', '“It’s one thing to make something work, and that can be very difficult. But it has to work cost effectively to be viable as a system because of the scale we’re talking about,” he said.', 'Visualize a sandwich, said ESS’ business development lead, Hugh McDermott. The ESS battery technology is a stack of carbon plates that has salt water with iron flowing through each layer.', 'Iron comes out of the salt water solution and sticks to one side of the plates. When the polarity of the plates is changed, the iron dissolves back into the water solution.', 'From a battery management control system, the flow of the ions can be switched, thereby also switching the flow of electricity onto and off the grid.', 'The idea of an iron flow battery has been around since the 1970s, Dresselhuys said. But there were technical issues that scientists hadn’t solved.', 'For example, early iterations of the iron flow battery technology would work for a while, but the electrolyte fluid would become imbalanced, build up on the battery, and the battery would become ineffective over time. To fix this, ESS developed a proton pump, which Dresselhuys said “allows the system to keep itself in balance throughout all of those charges and discharges so that the electrolyte is entirely clean.”', 'Early research was funded in part by almost $3 million in grant funding from the Department of Energy’s ARPA-E program, as well as individuals and local investment funds.', '“The elegance is the simplicity,” said Rich Hossfeld, co-CEO at SB Energy and a board member at ESS. SB Energy is an ESS customer as well as an investor.', 'But it took a lot of research and development to get a simple solution to work. ESS has been working on research and development for a decade. The proton pump was a really key breakthrough for the company, but one of many.', '“There’s a very large intellectual property moat around the core technology, and that will make it very difficult for other competitors to build a battery that is similar to ESS’ battery,” Hossfeld told CNBC.', 'A long-duration battery being developed by Form Energy also uses iron and also is backed by Breakthrough Energy Ventures. Form, however, is developing iron-air batteries, which uses different technology and aims to provide energy storage for multiple days.', 'ESS batteries can store energy for four to 12 hours, whereas the lithium batteries in cars are typically capped between two and four hours, Dresselhuys said.', 'To go above four hours of energy storage with lithium-ion batteries requires increasing the number of lithium-ion cells, Hossfeld told CNBC. ESS, on the other hand, can just add more water, iron and salt to a bigger tank of its stack-sandwiches.', '“The way to think about ESS cost-wise is they are cost parity with lithium-ion at four hours and about half the cost above that, which we think creates a big advantage for them,” Hossfeld told CNBC.', 'Another key to the ESS iron flow technology is its resilience.', '“Capacity stays the same between year one and year 20,” Hossfeld said. Anyone who has a cellphone knows that is not the case for lithium-ion batteries. “You open it up, it comes out of the case, right now it will give you 10 hours. We all know it doesn’t give you 10 hours in a year, right?”', 'Energy centers are co-located with a solar or wind farm. A solar farm allows the batteries to charge up during the day when the sun is shining and then discharge in the late afternoon when there is typically a bump in energy demand.', 'It works similarly on a wind farm. “You can store four, eight, 10 hours of wind plants in the middle of the night and then discharge it during the day as needed,” Hossfeld told CNBC. “We look at ESS as a really good complement to that daily cycling between wind and solar.”', 'The Energy Warehouse, the only ESS product that exists so far, is the size of a shipping container, 40 feet long and 8 feet wide.', '“That container holds 500 kilowatt hours of energy. That’s roughly the energy that you would need to power 20 to 30 homes, depending on where you are in the country,” McDermott told CNBC.', 'ESS is also building a product called Energy Centers intended for utilities and independent power producers — for instance, businesses that own large solar farms who then sell that power to the grid.', 'For these kinds of larger customers, ESS will use similar battery technology, but the battery modules will be contained together in a building.

26,How Europe can reduce its dependence on Russian natural gas,2022-03-07T22:51:35+0000,"['A global energy group has come up with a road map to help deal with Europe’s dependence on natural gas from Russia, which has given President Vladimir Putin leverage over the European Union, making it hard to impose energy sanctions on the country as punishment for its invasion of Ukraine.', 'The plan from the International Energy Agency, a policy organization with members from 31 national governments, would reduce the region’s dependence on Russian natural gas by one-third in one year while still adhering to the European Green Deal, an EU agreement to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% from 1990 levels by 2030.', 'Its recommendations are akin to measures reportedly coming from the EU that would slash Russian imports of natural gas by 80% in the coming year.', 'But turning off the spigot to Russian natural gas is going to be hard to do quickly, according to experts. That’s both because the EU is so dependent on it, and because it has committed to limit its greenhouse gas emissions.', 'The EU imported 155 billion cubic meters of natural gas from Russia in 2021, almost half (45%) of its gas imports and nearly 40% of the total amount used, according to the IEA. Switching from burning natural gas to burning coal is a quick fix that is technically possible, but it’s not going to help the EU achieve its climate goals.', 'The IEA’s drawdown, named “A 10-Point Plan to Reduce the European Union’s Reliance on Russian Natural Gas,” is a collection of actions designed to diversify Europe’s energy supply, accelerate its move toward renewables and focus on energy efficiency.', '“Nobody is under any illusions anymore. Russia’s use of its natural gas resources as an economic and political weapon show Europe needs to act quickly to be ready to face considerable uncertainty over Russian gas supplies next winter,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a written statement announcing the plan.', 'Here’s a summary of the 10 recommendations:', 'Do not renew gas supply contracts with Russia. Currently, the EU has a contract with Gazprom, a Russian majority state-owned multinational energy corporation, for more than 15 billion cubic meters of gas imports per year. That contract is due to expire at the end of the year. The EU is advised to let that and other gas import contracts expire.', 'Replace expired contracts from Russia with those from other sources. Domestic production of natural gas and imports from non-Russian sources, including from Azerbaijan and Norway, are set to increase over the coming year by as much as 10 billion cubic meters compared to 2021. But the IEA says the EU should go further and increase its importing of liquid natural gas (LNG), which is natural gas that has been cooled to a liquid state at about -260° Fahrenheit so it can more easily be transported in ships or trucks.', 'The IEA also recommends the EU increase its biogas and biomethane supply, but those supply chains take time to grow. So, too, do the supply chains of low-carbon “green” hydrogen made with electrolysis.', 'Store more gas. Storing gas gives any region a buffer of security in the case of changing seasons, extreme events or in this case, war. The IEA would have working storage capacity filled at 90% by Oct. 1 to keep homes warm during the winter.', 'Accelerate deployment of renewable energy, like wind and solar. In 2022, the EU is expected to see a 15% increase in its power delivered from renewable energy compared to 2021 on increasing spending on new solar and wind facilities and favorable weather patterns. The IEA recommends accelerating renewable projects in progress by addressing delays in permit processing. This would require more administrative workers, making for better communication between permitting authorities, setting clear deadlines and going digital with applications.', 'Keep existing nuclear open and operate bioenergy plants at full scale. Some of the existing nuclear reactors in Europe were taken offline in 2021 for maintenance and safety checks, but when those power plants get back online this year they will add to clean energy generation. Nuclear power plants, once they are built, generate energy without emitting any greenhouse gases. Also, commercial levels of nuclear power are expected to begin at Finland’s new nuclear plant in 2022, which will help meeting the region’s emission goals.', 'A small handful of nuclear power reactors were set to be taken offline in 2022 and 2023, but if those reactors stay operational, that would decrease the EU’s demand for Russian natural gas.', 'Also, bioenergy power plants which operated at only 50% capacity should be fueled fully and operated to their capacity.', 'Protect vulnerable customers. When energy prices soar, energy companies do well, while some customers often struggle economically. The EU should be prepared to support low-income customers’ pay for their high energy bills. One way to account for the current high-energy-price market is to put temporary taxes on excessively high profits from energy companies and use that collected money to pay for energy bills for low-income users.', 'Accelerate the replacement of gas boilers with heat pumps. The IEA calls for the EU to accelerate its rate of replacing gas furnaces with heat pumps in homes.', 'Doubling the installation rate of heat pumps in homes would cost the region $16.3 billion (15 billion euros) and it would save another 2 billion cubic meters of gas within the first year. It would be ideal, the IEA says, to simultaneously increase energy efficiency projects within homes.', 'Accelerate energy efficiency programs for buildings and industrial facilities. Currently, about 1% of the EU’s buildings are retrofitted to be more energy efficient each year. To maximize impact, the region should focus on improving the efficiency of the least efficient homes and nonresidential buildings.', 'Also, the IEA suggests accelerating the installation of smart thermostats to reduce energy demand. Adoption could be accelerated by providing subsidies to households to install one, for example.', 'Ask the public to turn down their heating. Most buildings are almost 72 degrees Fahrenheit on average, and asking consumers to turn down their thermostat by 1.8 degree Fahrenheit, or 1 degree Celsius, has the potential to reduce demand for gas by 10 billion cubic meters.', 'Increase low-emissions grid reliability mechanisms. The IEA recommends that the EU focus on adding flexibility to the power grid both in terms of being resilient through seasonal shifts and in being able to handle short-term demand spikes. Currently, the it manages the ebbs and flows in the energy grid demand with stored natural gas.', 'Improving grid reliability and flexibility in the future will depend on a diverse portfolio of responses, including both battery technology and other large scale, longer-term energy storage technologies. Some low-carbon gases made within the EU such as biomethane, low-carbon hydrogen and synthetic methane can be part of improving reliability of the grid, but they won’t be sufficient to meet overall energy demands.', 'It’s worth noting, the IEA’s plan pales in the comparison to news of another plan reportedly coming from the EU on Tuesday that would slash Russian imports of natural gas by 80% in the coming year.']"
27,A Russian invasion of Ukraine could send shockwaves through financial markets,2022-02-02T20:26:04+0000,"['The highly unpredictable nature of Russia’s threat against Ukraine has rippled across financial markets without much impact on stocks. But if Russia were to move its troops across the border, it could cause a major risk-off event — sending equities lower and commodity prices even higher.', 'The U.S. plans on stinging sanctions if Russia moves into Ukraine. Russia, which says it has no intention to invade, could inflict pain on the rest of the world through its strong hold on some key commodities.', 'For now, the markets are not pricing any such calamity, but oil prices would spike and European gas prices could surge even more than they already have if Russian troops enter Ukraine. Oil and some other commodity prices have already built in some premium, and Russian assets have been hit.', 'If there were an invasion, the dollar could strengthen, U.S. bond yields would likely move lower and commodities — including wheat and palladium — would rally.', '“There’s another round of U.S.-Russian talks. As long as talks are going on, it’s hard to imagine Russia would go to war,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. He noted that the Russian ruble, off 2.2% for the year, outperformed other emerging market currencies in the past five days with a 4.1% gain.', '“Because they’re still talking, the market knows it doesn’t have to worry about it right now,” Chandler said. “Markets aren’t as concerned about it as maybe as much as the politicians.”', 'However, RBC head of global commodities strategy Helima Croft said the odds of an invasion may be higher than some in the markets expect. “Even if it’s at 50%, that is a really high risk, given the stakes involved,” she said.', 'Some analysts believe Russia will choose not to invade and instead cause other problems for Ukraine, like cyber warfare or other economic disruptions. But if Russia does invade, the U.S. and the U.K. have promised swift retaliation in the form of economic sanctions on President Vladimir Putin, Russian oligarchs and other individuals, its financial system and industries.', '“What I do know is if those tanks cross the border, oil will go above $100 dollars a barrel,” Croft said. “We’ll certainly feel it on the European gas market. We’ll feel it on the wheat market. We’ll feel it across a variety of markets. Russia is not a one-trick pony.”', 'Croft said Russia is the world’s largest wheat exporter, and together with Ukraine, they account for roughly 29% of the global wheat export market.', '“They’re not just a gas station. They’re a commodity superstore. They’re a massive metal producer. Where we think it gets painful is food and energy prices,” Croft said, adding that it would cause more inflation in an already inflationary environment.', '“If they stop short of an invasion, we’re not talking about a major disruption of commodities,” she said.', 'TD Securities head of global commodities strategy Bart Melek said he sees the odds of an invasion at less than 50%. But if there is one, he said that commodity prices would spike — and so would inflation.', '“Much depends on how robust the sanctions are,” he said. “Are they direct or going after the guys who finance the stuff? Or insurers? The risk is there are certain markets, like aluminum, that we think is going to be in a deficit already by 2.3 million tons. If you exclude Russian supply out of that and palladium as well, we could certainly see them touch the highs.”', 'Melek said Russia is also a large nickel producer, and fertilizers are a byproduct of its natural gas production. He said Russia also exports potash, and if it withheld any supply, that could trigger higher food prices, as crop yields could drop.', 'Russian media reported the country would ban export of the fertilizer ammonium nitrate for the next two months, said John Kilduff of Again Capital. He noted it will soon be planting season in the Northern Hemisphere. “Now they’re using food as a weapon,” he said.', 'Paul Christopher, Wells Fargo Investment Institute head of global market strategy, does not see a high probability of an invasion. If there is one, however, Christopher said the risk to Russia would be friction with its biggest trading partner. Putin has objected to the plan for Ukraine to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.', '“If Putin does invade it’s because he really wants a standoff with NATO, and markets could find themselves thinking about a new cold war. It’s still going to be a big hole in the Russian economy. They need to sell stuff to the West,” Christopher said.', 'Russia is one of the world’s largest energy producing countries, exporting about 5 million barrels of oil a day. Russia also has provided Europe with about a third of its natural gas, and the U.S. has long objected to Europe’s reliance on Russia’s energy resources for security reasons.', '“A rising food price puts governments under pressure. Russia is a big player in the quality of life commodity market,” RBC’s Croft said. “They already reduced [gas] flows out of Ukraine.”', 'Russian gas flows into Europe through a Nord Stream I pipeline but also pipelines going through Ukraine. Croft said if Ukraine were involved in a conventional war, energy flows would be halted and there would be concerns of infrastructure damage.', '“But it’s a broader question. Does Russia start talking about scaling back oil exports? There’s a question about what is the ultimate game plan” in the event their banks are sanctioned and they are locked out of financial transactions, Croft said.', 'Oil has been moving higher on the tensions but also on tight supply, which has been made even tighter as natural gas customers switch over to crude.', 'Natural gas prices in Europe this winter have skyrocketed. Natural gas was at $25 per million BTU in Europe on Wednesday, more than five times the U.S. price. It has risen on a shortfall in supply and concerns that tensions will limit imports of Russian gas. However, earlier this winter the price was more than double.', 'Kilduff said there’s been a change of tone in the European gas market this week, even as the tensions continue to flare. “The siege mentality is rapidly easing,” he said, noting Russia released more gas to Europe earlier today.', 'Since the fall, Russia has been sending less gas than normal to Europe. The continent began the winter with too little supply in storage. Then cold weather and other issues resulted in price spikes.', 'According to IHS Markit, efforts to bring more liquified natural gas to the region from the U.S. seems to be making a difference.', 'Michael Stoppard, chief strategist for global gas at IHS Markit, said U.S. liquified natural gas shipments to Europe set a record this January at about 250 million cubic meters a day, up 80% from last year. Stoppard said cargos were diverted from Asia and Brazil.', 'At the same time, he said that less has been coming from Russia into Europe, and Russian imports of gas are down about 45% in January.', '“The amount that came through from Russian pipelines in January was about the same as that from U.S. ships,” said Stoppard. He said Qatar is also a large supplier, sending 55MMcm/day in LNG to Europe, and the Middle Eastern country has the capacity to increase that by about 35 MMcm/day.', '“Europe is able to cope with a disruption of gas through the Ukraine corridor but LNG would be not able to cover for a full loss of Russian gas,” Stoppard said. If Europe were to see supply cut this winter, it could draw on its storage to get through but not longer term.', '“We wouldn’t expect U.S. sanctions to stop Russian gas. The bigger risk but also considered unlikely is whether Russia would stop selling gas as retaliation for sanctions in other areas,” he added.', 'West Texas Intermediate crude futures were trading just under $88 a barrel Wednesday after OPEC+, which includes Russia, agreed to continue to increase production. But OPEC+ but did not raise it any more than the 400,000 barrels a day that were expected, despite requests from the U.S.', 'Russian assets have felt the pinch of worries over Ukraine and a new stiffer round of sanctions on Moscow.', 'Barclays points out that Russia credit spreads have widened materially over the past few weeks, as the tensions have escalated.', '“Russia credit tends to underperform broader markets as geopolitical tensions build up and around sanction announcements. However, at least from a sovereign credit perspective, periods of underperformance have often been followed by a relatively swift rebound,” the Barclays analysts wrote in a note.', 'Russian ETFs have also been weaker.

I think that’s the real issue. The confusion about the Fed. I think Ukraine is going to go away once people stop worrying about the Fed.”']"
28,"Rocket Lab gives first look at plans for bigger, reusable Neutron rocket as it takes on SpaceX",2021-12-02T14:07:31+0000,"['Rocket Lab on Thursday revealed more about the larger, more powerful Neutron rocket it is developing.', '“This is Neutron. It is an absolute beast,” Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck said in a webcast presentation.', 'Neutron is designed to be 131 feet tall and 23 feet in diameter, and it’s targeting a maximum payload capacity of 15,000 kilograms to low Earth orbit. For reusable launches, Neutron will be able to carry up to 8,000 kilograms to low Earth orbit. These are the first details given about the new rocket since the company announced it announced plans for it earlier in the year.', 'Beck, in an interview with CNBC on Thursday, said that Rocket Lab is still targeting to get Neutron on the launchpad by 2024, and hopes to launch a commercial customer on the rocket by 2025.', 'The launch marketplace is divided into three sections: small, medium and heavy lift. Neutron will target that middle section, while Rocket Lab’s existing Electron rocket fits in the small segment.', 'While SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket can lift up to 22,800 kilograms to low Earth orbit, Neutron will compete to launch many of the same spacecraft that Elon Musk’s company is currently delivering to space.', 'Beck declined to comment on the price tag of a Neutron launch, but said the rocket “would be a pointless exercise” if Rocket Lab “didn’t think that we would be very cost competitive with with anything that’s currently in the market or or being proposed.” For comparison, Rocket Lab’s small Electron rocket goes for about $7 million per launch, Firefly’s medium-sized Alpha rocket goes for $15 million per launch, and SpaceX’s Falcon 9 is advertised at $62 million per launch.', 'Similar to the Falcon 9, the first stage of Neutron is reusable — but that’s where most of the similarities end. While SpaceX occasionally lands its Falcon 9 boosters back near the launch site but typically lands on a drone ship in the ocean, Neutron is designed to return to the launch site for all its reusable missions.', 'Beck did not rule out “ever landing on a drone ship,” noting that there are “a bunch of use cases were landing on a drone is advantageous,” but emphasized that returning to the launch site is “the most cost effective” approach.', '“I would never say never to anything anymore,” Beck said, after earlier this year eating a physical hat after having said that Electron would not be reusable.', 'Beck described Neutron as “a very fat vehicle,” which he said gives it “a big ballistic coefficient” and makes it ideal for launching, landing, and launching again.', '“If you’ve got something that’s fat in diameter and lightweight, it decelerates really, really quickly. So you [reduce] the thermal loads and [the amount of] propellant requirements to deal with those thermal loads on a return to launch site trajectory,” Beck said.', 'Instead of landing legs that unfold, Neutron will have a “static base” with no mechanisms in place. The rocket will have “shock absorbers” built into that base for the impact of landing, Beck said.', 'Rocket Lab is also developing a new engine for Neutron called Archimedes. Beck touted Archimedes’ design as “very simple,” with “all the things you want when you have to build an engine that can be reused over and over again.”', 'Seven Archimedes engines power Neutron’s first stage to space, with an eighth one propelling the upper stage once in orbit.', '“Archimedes will breathe its first fire next year,” Beck said.', 'Another unique feature of the Neutron’s design is the fairing, or nosecone. Nicknamed the “Hungry Hippo fairing,” the company designed it to stay connected to the rocket’s body, rather than disconnect and fall back into the atmosphere as current rockets do.', 'Neutron’s fairing will open, deploy the upper stage, then close for the return trip to land.', '“The answer is not throwing away the fairings where you’re trying to catch them – the best way is to never get rid of them in the first place,” Beck said.', 'The only part of Neutron that is not reusable is the upper stage, which deploys from within the rocket once in space. Its design enables it to be very lightweight, Beck emphasized, with a “super thin structure.”', '“That stage is hung inside the fairing, so there is no thermal aero load, there is no bucking load, there is no structural load – it’s just literally hung like a balloon underneath the payload,” Beck said.', 'Neutron is designed to be turned around from landing to another launch within 24 hours.', '“Not because I actually want to cycle the vehicle in 24 hours, but because that drives all of the requirements that we want in a positive direction,” Beck said.', 'Realistically, Rocket Lab will start off with a “conservative” launch rate, Beck said, like the company did with Electron.', 'But the tight turnaround time requirement for the design is a cost-driven decision, as Beck emphasized that “the cost of components is not the driving factor” in the rocket business, but it’s instead the operational costs.', '“If it takes three weeks or a month to refurbish the vehicle, that’s a month worth of time that people have got to be working on it,” Beck said.', 'Rocket Lab has yet to announce the location of the Neutron production facility, but the company previously said it will be near NASA’s Wallops flight facility in Virginia where it plans to launch the rocket. Beck said the company is “running a very competitive process” for the manufacturing plant and is “close to nailing that down.”', 'One crucial aspect of the Neutron facility is that it needs to be close to the launch site, as Beck said the company will not flip it horizontal to ship it to a location.', '“It starts off out of the factory vertical and it spends it’s whole life vertical,” Beck said.', 'That furthers Rocket Lab’s reusability goals, as it eliminates the need for infrastructure at the launchpad such as a strong back to hold the rocket vertical before launch.', 'Rocket Lab is also designing Neutron within the requirements necessary to launch a spacecraft that carries people. While the company is “focusing on delivering cargo at this point in time,” Beck said that the company’ is “making sure we don’t preclude ourselves” from using Neutron to launch astronauts at some point.', '“I’ve eaten enough hats now,” Beck said, laughing.', 'For now, Rocket Lab is not internally developing a crew capsule, with Beck emphasizing that he believes the market for flying astronauts needs to grow further.', '“We need to see more growth on the customer side, as there’s really one customer – that’s NASA – and they’re well served,” Beck said.']"
