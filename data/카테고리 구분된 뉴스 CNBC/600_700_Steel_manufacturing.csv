0,"One industry is holding North America together, no matter what happens with Trump",2017-01-24T18:37:02+0000,"['  President Donald Trump just tightened the ties that bind the  North American energy industry with his push for the Keystone XL  pipeline, making the U.S. potentially less dependent on Middle  Eastern oil.', ' Trump’s advancing of the controversial Keystone  Pipeline comes just as his administration plans to  renegotiate a two-decade-old trade pact with Canada and  Mexico.', '  The president signed an executive order Tuesday advancing  Keystone, as well as the Dakota Access pipeline, both of   which were opposed due to environmental concerns. Keystone  would be a nearly 1,200-mile pipeline that would take about  800,000 barrels a day of Canadian sands oil from Alberta to  Steele City, Nebraska, where it would meet up with a southern leg  of the pipeline that could send it to the Gulf Coast  refineries. ', '  The Dakota Access pipeline would take oil south from the Bakken  in North Dakota.', '  “It’s more likely the additional quantities of oil coming down  from Keystone will be consumed here in the U.S., competing with  alternatives that will be coming from the Middle East,” said  Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. “It’s 10 percent  of our imported demand but Canada is already supplying us with  3.2 million barrels a day.”', '  Canada sands is a “heavy crude,” similar to the crude grade  imported from the Middle East. “We’re still a heavy importer of  crude from Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Kuwait,” said Lipow.', '  Trump, in signing the order, required that American steel be used  in the building of the pipelines, and said the approvals were  subject to renegotiation. But it is the Keystone XL pipeline that  would enhance the already very integrated North American energy  market, by providing a key artery to take Canadian crude that has  been locked in Canada to the Gulf Coast. ', '  The pipeline would be the latest piece of cross-border  infrastructure that ties the U.S., Canada and Mexico together,  all as importers and exporters of energy. ', '  “It’s not only very significant in terms of actual energy trade  but it [Keystone] is very symbolic though in radically different  ways to U.S.-Canadian trade relations and to the environmental  community,” said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS  Markit.', '  “The unbuilt Keystone pipeline achieved the unique status of  becoming the most famous pipeline in the world even though it is  not completed,” he said. ', '  Absent the pipeline, Canadian producers would be forced to send  more crude by rail as they also work on getting alternative  pipelines heading to Canada’s east and west coasts. Canada has  the third largest proven reserves in the world after Saudi Arabia  and Venezuela.', '  Regardless of what happens with the North American Free Trade  Agreement, the U.S., Canada and Mexico have energy ties that  transcend borders and go back decades. ', '  The three countries have intentionally worked to combine the  advantages of their energy resources. Viewed as friendly to the energy  sector, there are still questions about whether the  Trump administration could enact changes that affect the  intricate web of energy connections between the three countries.  The Republican Congress has already proposed a border tax that  could complicate the situation, if approved.', '  While still seen as a low probability, the border adjustment tax  would tax all imports at the border and exports would not be  taxed at all. At the proposed corporate tax rate of 20 percent, a  number of analysts say the border tax would be expected to make  U.S. crude more expensive than international Brent. ', '  Goldman Sachs analysts projected that gasoline prices would jump  as a result by about 30 cents per gallon. The analysts said the  dollar could adjust and move higher over time, reducing the  impact. ', '  “It’s not so simple to say we’re going to renegotiate the trade  deals. We set up the system to create those inter-linkages. You  just can’t overnight legislate or executive order that away. If  you try to do that, it’s going to have negative economic impacts,  not just for the economies on the border but for these specific  industries, like energy,” said Scott Anderson, chief economist at  Bank of the West, in an interview last month.', '  Trump’s selection of  former Texas Gov. Rick Perry as  energy secretary is seen as a positive for the oil and gas  industry. Perry has spoken favorably about North America as a  integrated energy powerhouse, including Mexico and Canada.   ', '  Perhaps one of the most surprising recent developments is the  boom in U.S. natural gas that’s flowing across the southern  border, and the ambitious plans by the Mexican government to  build more pipelines to take U.S. natural gas throughout Mexico  and as far as Mexico City.', '  “Mexico has become a very important market for U.S. gas producers  and without it, we’d be looking at lower prices,” said Yergin.  U.S. producers, grappling with low prices and record winter  supply, would have to cap even more wells if it weren’t for the  growing demand from Mexico, which now accounts for about 5  percent of U.S. natural gas output. ', '  The energy picture changed dramatically for North America in the  last decade. The push by the U.S. energy industry into hydraulic  fracking and horizontal drilling unleashed an energy boom,  making the U.S. the world’s biggest producer of natural gas and  placing it firmly among the top three oil producers.', '  That has changed the situation for all of North America, at a  time when Mexico’s oil and gas output was in decline and Canada  found some of its potential crude output landlocked. The ties  between the three countries go way back. In the early 1900s, the  U.S. began sharing electricity with its neighbors, and Canada is  now a significant net exporter of electricity to the U.S.', '  One catalyst has been Mexico’s program of energy reform, intended  to break the hold of state-owned Pemex on its industry and bring  new private investment to Mexico’s energy industry. The decline  in big part was due to a lack of investment by the government in  Petroleos Mexicanos, and its increasing reliance on Pemex’s  revenue stream for its own budget.', '  “Before shale, the U.S. was importing a lot more gas from  Canada,” said Anthony Yuen, global energy analyst at Citigroup,  in a recent interview. The U.S. was also worried not that long  ago that it would need to import LNG, liquefied natural gas. But  the shale boom changed everything.', '  Yuen said Canadian gas is still important to the U.S. West Coast,  the Midwest and New England, in part because pipelines don’t  carry U.S. gas to those areas. Gas imports from Canada fluctuate  based on weather, and can go from 5 billion to 7 billion cubic  feet a day, he said.', '  “This speaks to how extensive the energy cooperation is between  these countries,” said Yuen. “It’s almost as if the borders  aren’t really there. If you look at Canada and the U.S., they are  part of the same cross-border electricity reliability councils  for some regions. … It’s not just natural gas, it’s power  lines, hydroelectricity and those are long-standing agreements  and trade.”', '  The U.S. energy boom has also been Mexico’s gain, and Mexico, in  turn, has changed the dynamic for the U.S. gas market. “Without  exports to Mexico, the U.S. market would not be where we are  right now. It would be way lower. Producers may not be drilling  as many wells. Without Mexico, it would be tough,” said  Yuen. ', '  According to Citigroup, new cross-border pipeline capacity of 7  billion cubic feet per day is expected to come on line by 2020,  adding to the current capacity of 6 billion to 7 billion cubic feet per  day. Energy Transfer Partners, seeking to build the controversial  Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota, has approval from the  Obama administration to build two pipelines to  take gas from Texas to Mexico.', 'Trump’s pick for energy secretary, Perry, had been on the board of Energy Transfer Partners before resigning.', ' Citigroup said the added pipeline capacity will come as Mexico  undergoes a dramatic build out of power generation capacity and  transmission lines. Mexico’s energy secretary, speaking at an  industry conference in Houston last spring, said there is a 75  percent savings from U.S. natural gas.', '  “Mexico had a pretty high cost of power in the past, because the  country used oil as a power-generation fuel, and natural gas  there is more expensive because of pipeline bottlenecks,” said  Yuen.  “We would not be surprised if exports to Mexico by  2020 by pipeline would still be larger than U.S. LNG exports.”  Liquefied natural gas is currently being shipped from just one  terminal in the United States, but the capacity is expected to  expand.', '  According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. exported 4.2  billion cubic feet per day of natural gas to Mexico, through  pipelines in August. The average daily exports through  August were running at a yearly average of 3.6 billion cubic feet  per day, 25 percent above last year and 85 percent above the  five-year average. The U.S. produces 90 billion cubic feet per  day of natural gas and consumes about 70 billion cubic feet,  according to the Energy Information Administration.', '  Mexican demand can also help offset weather-related declines in  U.S. demand, and for that reason it has helped support the price  of natural gas. ', '  “Mexico can serve as a balance,” said Michael Cohen, head of  commodities energy research at Barclays.  “It’s important  regionally because right now you have a whole bunch of growth in  production in the Northeast, and now you have constraints on that  production getting out. The fact you have Mexican demand  increases can balance out where the supply might come from in the  medium term.”', '  Mexico, in fact, now imports almost as much natural gas from the  U.S. as it produces, and the U.S. in recent months has become a  net exporter of natural gas for the first time in a sustainable  way. ', '  “It could very well be a case where there’s some tweaking around  on [NAFTA], as opposed to a big breakdown. Certainly, I am  concerned a little bit about the Mexican economy. It’s been a big  driver of demand for U.S. gas,” said Francisco Blanch, Bank of  America Merrill Lynch head of global commodities research and  derivatives, in a recent interview. “The supply chains are very well integrated between  the three countries. Changing the rules of the game on account of  NAFTA would be pretty challenging not just for Mexico but for  U.S. companies.”', '  Mexican oil output has been in decline and is now at its lowest  point since the early 1980s. The U.S. is producing about 8.8 million barrels a day of oil, down from a high of 9.6 million  barrels a day last year, a direct result of lower crude  prices. But the U.S. also imports another approximately 8 million barrels a  day, and in September, about 520,000 barrels a day of that came  from Mexico.', '  Canada is the biggest crude exporter to the U.S., sending 3.2  million barrels a day this year to the United States, of the 3.8  million barrels a day it produces, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. CAPP expects Canadian  production to increase to 4.9 million barrels a day by 2030.', '  “People just don’t realize how integrated we are with these two  countries,” said Lipow. The U.S. is now a net exporter of refined  products, and its biggest market for formulated gasoline and  blend stocks is Mexico, which imported 390,000 barrels a day in  September, about a third more than last year. ', '  “Instead of Mexico spending a fortune building new refineries,  they are buying from the U.S., and it turns out energy exports  are now an important contributor to the jobs in our economy,”  said Yergin.', '  Canada, meanwhile, buys some U.S. crude to refine while sending  the U.S. both oil and refined products. The U.S. imported 171,000  barrels per day of finished gasoline and blend stocks and 87,000  barrels a day of diesel fuel. Canada refines the crude in New  Foundland and Nova Scotia.', '  “If it wasn’t coming in, Maine would run dry,” said Lipow. While  it’s not a lot of refined product, the Canadian fuel does supply  gas stations from Maine to Boston. “It’s pretty steady, but the  point is, it keeps coming.”', 'Electricity also flows back and forth over the border, and the  U.S. imports more electricity than it exports. ', '  In a 2015 report, the Department of Energy said there were 30  active transmission connections between the U.S. and Canada,  trading about $3 billion worth of electricity in 2014. ', '  The exchange of electricity with Mexico is less developed though  it started back in 1905, when privately owned utilities in remote  areas struck cross-border deals to share power over low voltage  lines. ', '  In 2015, the U.S. government granted Blackstone Group permission  to export electricity from the Frontera power plant in the Rio  Grande Valley to Mexico’s newly opened electricity market this  year. Mexican customers pay nearly twice as much as U.S.  customers do for the power.', '  “Mexico is building some renewable projects along the border and  that power is going to the U.S.,” said Alex Wood, DOE policy  analyst, in a recent interview. ', '  “It really is becoming more and more integrated,” said Wood of  the North American market. “Virtually all of Canada’s surplus oil  goes to the United States. The United States is producing surplus  crude oil. … It’s refined and it goes to Mexico.”', '  Wood added that Sempra’s Energia Sierra Juarez wind farm in  Mexico provides power to southern California.']"
1,You don’t have to be Peter Thiel to buy a place in New Zealand,2017-01-30T13:30:00+0000,"[' “I want to make an offer on this property,″ my husband, Richard, said. ', 'He was calling from 9,200 miles away on New  Zealand’s South Island to describe 10 sheep-dotted acres in one  of the world’s prettiest countries. The parcel had electricity,  water and telephone hookups. ', 'We could build a “bach” (pronounced “batch”), local slang for a getaway cottage, and  watch the sun slip behind rolling hills. Palmerston, with a gas  station and convenience stores, was five minutes away.  A breathtaking South Pacific beach lay just beyond. The clincher was  the land’s suitability for tree-planting, as Richard, a pilot for 40  years, longed to dig in dirt after a lifetime viewing the planet from a  cockpit.', 'We’d been traveling to New Zealand since the 1980s. Like  many Americans, we’d fallen in love with this environmentally  responsible, English-speaking nation. But there’d always  been stronger pulls to stay put: Jobs, family, money. ', 'Now, like  plenty of near-retirees, we had some cash earning minuscule interest,  kids who’d moved on and an itch for change. Throw in global  terrorism, gun violence and a turbulent U.S. election, and that made staking a  claim in a remote, two-island nation inhabited by 4.5 million  friendly Kiwis a real possibility.', 'Even one of President Donald Trump’s most high-profile  backers, PayPal co-founder and  billionaire investor Peter Thiel has a  large swath of property there, according to published reports.', ' Not that New Zealand makes the transition all that easy. Generally,  it doesn’t grant foreign property owners residency or other  special privileges. Long-term visas become more complicated as you  approach retirement — unless you have millions to invest. (Thiel also appears to have New Zealand citizenship, although how that was obtained is not clear.)', 'A housing boom down under has increased the hurdles. Big banks generally have  stopped offering mortgages to nonresidents, which makes purchasing more of a challenge as  prices have skyrocketed. ', 'In December, the average home value around  the nation’s biggest city, Auckland, was about $730,000,  up 12.2 percent from the year-earlier month. Near Queenstown, a  South Island outdoor-adventure mecca, values soared 31.6 percent  to roughly $725,000, property website QV.co.nz reported.', '  We succeeded — eventually — with  perseverance, flexibility and luck. We spent months scouring  listing website Trademe and swapping emails with  our local real estate broker. Richard opened a New Zealand bank account and started  his boots-on-the-ground search in early October. He chose  Cromwell, a once sleepy town about 35 miles from Queenstown, where Kiwi friends had moved, partly, to  flee high prices. ', '“Queenstown is like Aspen,” Richard said,  referring to the tony Colorado resort town. “Cromwell is where  the worker bees live.”', 'Yet Cromwell wasn’t cheap anymore. Houses we’d seen online in  the $215,000-range were fixer-uppers at best. One surprisingly  affordable property for tree-farming was littered with rocks and  largely “heritage land″ that couldn’t be altered. Another big  hurdle was the 328-acre size. ', '  Our local lawyer told us foreigners need approval from  the Overseas Investment Office to buy 5 hectares (12.36  acres) or more of rural land. We could purchase  multiple parcels under that size if they didn’t adjoin and  didn’t run afoul of other rules.  ', 'We switched gears and locales. We’d spotted a house on the  South Island’s east coast that looked good online. In person, it  wasn’t great. Discouraged again, Richard decided to focus  on small plots of land with house-building  potential. ', 'He found a real estate agent who had farmed the area. This  agent suggested the Palmerston parcel just up the road. The owner  had carved pieces off his property to create “lifestyle blocks.″  The remaining two were under the 5-hectare ceiling, but next to  each other. We ruled out buying both because of  the adjoining-parcel restriction. Richard  opted for the marginally larger one. “It’s a start,” I  said when he phoned. “Go for it.”', '  We agreed to tackle the bach later. This would give us time to  research contractors and landscapers and work with our local  governing body, the Waitaki District Council. It issues building  and other permits, performs inspections, and regulates zoning and  usage. We’ve learned, for one thing, that we can’t farm  chinchillas — oh, well.', '  As for the bach, we’re looking at options from a shipping  container to splurging on a soup-to-nuts design firm that  provides blueprints, secures some approvals and builds your  choice of home on your land. ', '  I pictured myself sipping a local pinot noir while Richard dried  his muddy boots by the fireplace in our two-bedroom, two-bathroom  tiny home. The drawback — the not-so-tiny  price of $215,000 and up, plus tax. Then again, we could  always park a camper on the site, our lawyer confirmed. A tent  might also suffice.', '  New Zealand property deals move quickly once you learn the ropes.  I arrived on Nov. 6, in time to tour the 10 acres and review the  paperwork. The map revealed a narrow strip between our parcel and  the second, 10-acre one. We discovered the owner had kept this  buffer land for a potential right of way; it wasn’t part of  either block. Since the lots didn’t adjoin, we could buy both,  our lawyer said. We signed for the first, then bid on the  second. ', '  By the end of my 10 days in New Zealand, we’d reached agreements  for 20 acres. For the price, about $200,000. Richard transferred cash  from his New Zealand bank to our lawyer to pay the seller. We  closed on the first property by email from our den on Dec. 15.  The date gives us the option of escaping to a Southern  Hemisphere summer should the U.S. winter, or political climate,  turn nasty. We’ll complete the second deal in July.

2,Bob Iger tells us about Disney’s $5.5 billion bet on China,2016-06-09T15:10:16+0000,"['Walt Disney opened its first Disneyland in mainland China Wednesday, with the  theme park being described as “authentically Disney and  distinctly Chinese.” ', 'CEO Bob Iger spoke with CNBC’s Eunice Yoon about the event, which Iger called the “biggest step” the company  has taken in an overseas market. Read the full exchange  below.', ' CNBC: Why is the park so important for  Disney’s ambitions in China? Iger: Well, China represents a great market  for the Walt Disney because our stories are not only known  here but they are universal in appeal, they touch people’s hearts  all over the world, no matter what country, no matter what  culture. So this is, I think, a great market for Disney and a  growth market as well. Obviously the size of the market, the  number of people, is another reason, but , and this is an  extremely [big] step —or the biggest step, actually —  that we’ve ever taken anywhere to grow in a market. ', ' CNBC: What is the next step for Disney in  this market? Iger: Well, I don’t know that there is a next  step; there are a number of steps. We continue to grow our motion  picture business. So far, most of that has been exporting films  that we make in other parts of the world into China; that’s  delivered great growth. China is now the No. 2 movie market in  the world. We also plan to make Disney movies here; we’ve  actually started that process. With the strength of the Disney  brand and the knowledge of Disney characters, there’s a growing  retail business here. And, in part because of digital technology  but in part just because of the growth of the market, there are  all sorts of opportunities in television, although there we  continue to face regulation that makes it a little more  difficult. ', ' CNBC: So, how does this park help with the  other parts of the business in this market?  Iger: Well, it clearly will serve as sort  of a booster rocket for people’s appreciation of Disney, the  knowledge that Disney is universal in appeal to people,  appreciation and knowledge of characters and stories. An  immersive park experience the Disney way is something that people  will remember for the rest of their lives, and that goes a long  way in terms of not just creating word of mouth, but in terms of  creating people’s interest in passion for our brand and  everything that it stands for and everything that bears its name,  as a for instance. So it becomes very, very important, not just  in terms of awareness but appreciation.', 'CNBC: How are Chinese consumers different from others?Iger: Well, in many respects as it relates to Disney, they’re not  different at all. In fact, they’ve confirmed to us what our  founder Walt Disney believed all the way back in his day, and  that is that our stories are designed not just for one age group  —children or parents or grandparents—not just one  nationality, not just for one religion, nor generation; they’re  designed for everybody, and he was right. And because of that,  the consumer we’re seeing now is really behaving as it relates to  interest in Disney the same way consumers behave when interest in  Disney is ignited all over the world.', ' CNBC: What are you doing in this park then,  differently for the Chinese, compared to other parks? Iger: Well, that’s something that is extremely important  to us and does differentiate this from all other parks. We  believe that in entering China we needed to bring a park to China  that very much felt like China’s Disneyland and not just,  Disneyland in China. We wanted to do that because we thought  showing a respect and appreciation for the culture here would be  very important, and we also wanted people to have a sense of  pride and ownership toward this park, feeling that this park was  their park. And there was only one way to do that. We knew we had  to be authentically Disney because that is what Disneyland is and  what was desired, but we also knew we had to be distinctly  Chinese and that because the design and construction mandate from  the very beginning, let’s build something that is authentically  Disney, distinctly Chinese, and that is evidenced throughout this  park in many, many different ways.  ', ' CNBC: So, how did you tailor this park for the  Chinese? Iger: Well, many ways. To begin with, we eliminated Main  Street. Main Street exists in our five other locations around the  world. It was the inspiration of Walt Disney; it was inspired by  the town in the Midwest United States that he grew up in,  Marceline. I felt strongly that bringing Main Street Marceline,  or Main Street USA, to China, wouldn’t necessarily feel relevant,  wouldn’t be of that much interest … kind of nice, but we  thought we could do something better. And so, we eliminated that  but we turned the entry sequence of sorts into Mickey Avenue, so,  it’s more based on Disney than on any one place in the world for  instance. All the iconography. Obviously [offering] Mandarin  first very, very important, save for a few places. Even our  storytelling here started in Mandarin and was translated to  English so that we could rework it and understand it instead of  the other way around, starting in English and then translating  into Mandarin. That way it’s much more authentic in terms of the  language, and the storytelling [is so] much more distinctive in  that sense, to use those words. The food was obvious, about 70  percent of the food here is Chinese in nature. ', '  Also, the entertainment, there’s a lot of entertainment in this  park; there are about 1,000 Chinese performers from all over  China. But the people behind the scenes, directors and costume  designers, the director of the ‘Tarzan’ show, who envisioned the  storytelling of Tarzan to be in Chinese acrobatic form with  Chinese performers, for instance, distinctly Chinese…. The  architecture, putting a Chinese teahouse right in the center of  this park in grand form, the Teahouse of the Wandering Moon.  Disneytown using architecture that is sort of old Shanghai  architecture, and people see it, and ‘Ah, I recognize that,’ I  like that. So, there’s a tremendous amount here that is very  distinctly Chinese, and we’re not expecting people to come in and  say, ‘That’s very Chinese.’ We’re expecting people to leave with  a sense that they experienced something that was very much Disney  but very much felt like theirs, very much felt like home. ', ' CNBC: Do you find that Chinese visitors spend time  differently in the parks? And, if so, how do you make sure that  you’re accommodating them properly? Iger: Well, this is all still very new. We’ve had  over half a million people come through this park and over a  million people actually visit the overall property, so, reaching  firm conclusions at this point would be premature. We’ve  certainly learned a lot already. Interesting, one thing that we  anticipated and it was reflected in the design, if you look at  China today, especially its most urban parts, there aren’t many  places that people can go to get shade, to relax, to be in what I  will call a bucolic setting. So, the design of Gardens of  Imagination, which is this seven-acre garden that sits in front  of the castle, serves as our hub but has water features, and is  tree lined and had plants and is generally a great place to sit  and relax. [It] was very much the results of research that we  did, where we believe that we were actually answering a need that  people had. The lake that we built, Wishing Star Lake, was  another example of that: let’s build a beautiful place that  people can walk around and sit and enjoy. As a for instance, we  actually have property within the confines of the theme park  itself that’s just grassy stretches for people to sit out on a  nice sunny day and sit on grass, and I noticed the other day  people throwing Frisbees around and people sitting and having  lunch. So they clearly are enjoying that. In terms of other forms  of behavior they are getting used to we’re offering, which is  Disney, a lot of people in one place, generally having a good  time, but it’s a different, unique experience for people. We’re  learning how they’re learning from us.', ' CNBC: We’ve already seen evidence there that the  economic slowdown has effected consumer behavior and the consumer  market, is this something that you’re worried about at  all?  Iger: No, because we’re building something to last  forever and when we make a decision to invest at this level we  don’t pin that decision on one time economically, we think long  term about a market; we really take a long view. So, whether it’s  here or in other parts of the world, current or near-term  economic circumstances or political circumstances or whatever  typically don’t cause much anxiety with us.', ' CNBC: Does it affect your pricing at all? Iger:  Our approach to pricing in this  marketplace took into [account] a number of circumstances and  conditions; none were really specifically tied what’s going on in  the economy today, but they took into account the overall Chinese  economy, the Chinese consumer, spendable income, price-to-value  relationship, the fact that we were building something [of that]  scale, something that was very high in quality, something that  was unique, something that many people aspire to, having heard  about, read about Disneyland and that experience. So, it was all,  a lot of things factored into the decision. ', ' CNBC: Who do you think your target Chinese consumer  is.. is there one?  Iger: The great new [approach] about Disney is everyone is  our target consumer. What I’ve loved [about] actually about  watching people enjoy this park the last few weeks is the  multigenerations that come together. We assumed that would be the  case, but the number of groups that include grandparents and  parents and a grandchild is just extraordinary to me. We thought  that would be the case, but it’s very evident here when you walk  around on a full day. It’s for everyone. I’ve seen single people.  You go at night, it’s very different; they don’t have kids, in  some cases they’re not married, people on dates. That’s always  nice to see. I’ve seen grandparents alone; I’ve seen parents with  kids; I’ve seen mothers with their children. It’s sort of, again,  the great thing about Disney, that universal appeal, and  certainly that’s true with this park.', ' CNBC:  Some of your Chinese competitors have  been saying negative things about you guys and saying that Disney  won’t necessarily having a long-term future here. Where do you  see Disney fitting into the overall theme park  industry?  Iger: Well, I think the theme park industry in China  is growing and will continue to grow. We were aware that there  was significant competition when we entered this market; we fully  anticipated there would be more competition. What we knew and  what we would concluded and what we already know to be the case  is we’re bringing a product that is unlike any other in this  market. Obviously, it starts with the fact that it’s Disney, and  with that comes Disney stories, characters and our intellectual  property. In addition to that, the level of the investment here  basically creates something that is unique in terms of quality.  In order to build something that is this great, all of the  detail, all of the beautiful artwork, all of the great  attractions, the technology that we put into the experience that  takes significant investment and our competitors don’t come close  in terms of either being able to or wanting to put that kind of  investment into their parks. In addition, we have 60 years of  operating experience. That’s a lot of experience; we do this  really well. And we’ve learned along the way, that’s only enabled  us to get better. No one comes close to that. The quality of the  experience that you get here, whether it’s what you’re eating,  what you’re riding, what show you’re seeing, how you’re being  treated by the person who’s taking your ticket, the person that’s  serving your meal, the person that’s making sure you’re in your  seat and ready for the ride to start, is vastly different than  what anyone else has to offer. So, to those that are criticizing  us, they clearly do not know our product, or they suffer from  significant envy for that product, and frankly, what they’ve said  is completely immaterial to us. ', ' CNBC: So, you wouldn’t say, when they say, ‘Oh, the  pricing is too high or you guys don’t understand China very  well,’ what do you….? Iger: The pricing of this park reflects the quality  of what we have built and the experience that we deliver. The  pricing of the parks of those that are criticizing us are  offering reflects exactly what they’re offering to their  people. ', ' CNBC: Switching gears a bit, I wanted to ask you a little  bit more about the American business community because there’s  been a feeling among the American business community that the  working environment here has become more anti-foreign. Is this  something that you’re experiencing as well or is it something  that enters your mind when you’re planning for the future?    Iger: China has always presented a number of  challenges to global business from a variety of directions, for a  variety of reasons, none that I really want to get into very  much. We’re well aware of what those challenges are and what they  have been, and yet, we continue to march forward and develop this  property and ultimately build it. I think the fact that we have  built this, that we have great Chinese partners, that we have the  approval of the government to do this, suggests that this is a  market that, while there have been challenges, that we’ve been  able to enter, I think, quite successfully. And clearly we’re  appreciative of the kind of support that we received and was  necessary from the government in order to do this. ', ' CNBC: How do you know that you have that high level  support within the government?  Iger: Well I’ve been working on this for 17 years,  and I’ve engaged with three presidents and a few premiers and a  number of vice-premiers and a number of party secretaries and  five or six mayors of Shanghai. And I know from the engagement  that I’ve had with numerous people over time, including President  Xi Jinping, that they are very supportive of what we are doing  here and what we have done here. This is, I think, a big shining  example of the fact that an American company or any kind of  global company can do something on a really grand scale here in  China. ', ' CNBC: Have any of them ever visited your  parks?  Iger: President Xi has been to a few of our parks,  yes. Actually, I think, to my knowledge, all those who I  referenced, even though I didn’t mention names, have visited  various parks at various times. ', ' CNBC: And what do they say their reactions are,  especially President Xi? Iger: Well, President Xi had said that he had visited  Tokyo and California and Orlando, and I think that’s one of the  reasons why he was supportive of us doing [this]. He must have  had a good experience. He didn’t tell me specifically that he  did, but I think [it] played a part in the approval of this.', ' CNBC: One other issue that a lot American companies  have is, of course, intellectual property rights violations. What  are you doing to contend with those issues, as well as  others? Iger: Well, I’ve always believed that the best way  you combat intellectual property theft is making a product  available that is well priced, well timed to market, whether it’s  movie product, TV product, music product, even theme-park  product. So, we’ll continue to do that. That said, we do need  regulatory help and support to do that. We’ve actually gotten  more of that in China; they’ve actually singled Disney  intellectual property out as something is to be protected, and  I’m fairly trusting that this government is going to continue to  do more and do the right thing as it relates to intellectual  property. Now, this is a good example, we have partners that are  local here that will suffer with us if the product that we  showcase here at our theme park is stolen by others. So, having a  local partner that is as invested, that may consider themselves  vulnerable to intellectual property theft, I think will go a long  way.  ', ' CNBC: What’s next for the theme-park business, Disney  Mumbai?  (laughing)   Iger: A lot of people have asked us about India.  Great country, land of many colors and many flavors, as I’ve  said. Rich country in terms of their culture. Certainly a lot of  people. Not developing a theme park there right now. ', '  [Shanghai] has been the priority of ours for quite a long time;  we’re incredibly excited about what we’re about to show the  world. We’re going to make sure that this is right, that it’s  operationally smooth and we obviously have great expansion  opportunities here in Shanghai. We’ll certainly take those very  seriously. We’re also expanding in Hong Kong and expanding in  Orlando and expanding in Tokyo and expanding in Anaheim, building  new cruise ships. So, there’s a lot going on at this company in  terms of expansion.', ' CNBC: What would tell Chinese consumers that say, ‘Oh  there’s already a Hong Kong park, I don’t necessarily need to go  to Shanghai’? Iger: Well, there’s a great Hong Kong park; I’d love  them to go to Hong Kong as well. They should go there because  it’s different, it’s very different and it’s great. We hope, by  the way, that people who have visited Hong Kong become interested  in visiting Shanghai because their interest has in some form or  another has been triggered by or been heightened by visiting Hong  Kong and vice versa. What’s great about this park is about 70  percent of it is original and so you can go here and you can go  to Hong Kong and have a completely different experience and vice  versa. And this is a big enough market, we have been asked this  before about two parks in one country; by the way, we’ve had two  in the United States for well over 40 years. China’s certainly  big enough to sustain more than one park — geographically,  number of people, affordability and tourism is rising as well to  China — and that’s obviously going to help. ', ' CNBC: You mentioned the movie business. Last year,  you guys had a monstrous successful year; your year was just  massive. Do you think that you’ll be able to repeat that again in  2016? Iger: Yes, 2016 — so far, so good. Off to a  great start, probably will be our most successful year ever,  given the fact that we’ve launched three fantastic movies in  ‘Zootopia,’ ‘Jungle Book’ and ‘Captain America Civil War.’  ‘Zootopia’ and ‘Captain America Civil War’ are already over a  billion dollars in global box office, ‘Jungle Book’ near it.  Great movies to come, ‘Finding Dory’ coming out in a couple of  weeks, for instance, and lots more to come this year . So, it’s  been a great year already for our company on the movie side, and  what we have coming up is going to be great, too.', ' CNBC: How do plan to turn things around for ESPN and  the cable business?  Iger: I’m here in Shanghai at Disneyland and while all of our  businesses are always on my mind, I’ve kind of put everything  else on my agenda off to the side temporarily so that we could  focus on this.']"

But today many are uniform patches of green at the peak of the summer growing season.', 'This new landscape is thanks to farmers such as Eric Moberg, whose 72-row air seeder planted thousands of acres with soyabeans this spring. “We didn’t grow any beans four years ago. Now it’s almost a third of our acre base,” he says.', 'His windswept county on the Canada border is at the frontier of a shift in world food supply. As emerging Asia eats more chicken and pork, the soyabeans that put muscle on birds and swine have spread across global farms at a faster rate than any other field crop, covering an area 28 per cent bigger than a decade ago.', 'More from Financial Times:  François Bayrou becomes latest minister to quit Macron governmentRepublican wins fierce battle for Georgia House seat Romania PM ousted after losing confidence vote', 'This year may mark a turning point. With planting almost complete, soyabeans are likely to have unseated corn as the most  widely sown crop in the US, analysts believe.', 'The soyabean has driven deep into Brazil’s interior savannah,  Argentina’s pampasand the US rural heartlands. Harvests have been big enough to deliver measurable bumps to the economies of Brazil and the US over the past year. In the next decade the ivory oilseed will drive total cropland above 1bn hectares (10m sq km) worldwide, expanding more than barley, corn, cotton, rice, sorghum or wheat, the US Department of Agriculture has forecast.', 'The triumph of the soyabean hinges on incomes in China. The country’s imports have trebled in the past decade to an estimated 93m tonnes in the coming year, equal to 66kg per person annually — or five cargo vessels a day. Delegates from China’s commerce ministry are due in the soyabean-rich state of Iowa next month to sign an agreement that could include a record purchase, the US Soybean Export Council says.', 'The shipments strengthened even as China’s demand for industrial commodities such as iron ore and copper wobbled. “It’s been a continued, phenomenal pace of growth,” says Gert-Jan van den Akker, head of agricultural supply chain at  Cargill, the food commodities company.', 'World demand for staples such as wheat has been rising in line with population growth at about 1 per cent per year. Soyabean consumption has been accelerating at 5 per cent a year — even more than corn, the main beneficiary of an aggressive US biofuels programme.', 'Any supermarket shopper knows soya is a versatile foodstuff, the source of tofu and cooking oil. Agribusiness has also transmogrified beans into goods such as ink, carpeting and biodiesel. But the soyabean plant’s runaway popularity is down to its unparalleled protein content.

It’s almost become too much,” says Ahmat Barat, a 41-year old taxi driver in Urumqi, the capital of China’s northwestern Xinjiang region. “When I was young, we didn’t have a fridge at home and we would only eat meat once or twice a week.”', 'To satisfy this appetite, Chinese animal agriculture has emerged from small “backyard” operations feeding food scraps to pigs to industrial businesses. Agriculture ministry data cited by US diplomats show that large-scale poultry farms grew from two-thirds to more than 90 per cent of China’s total and large-scale swine farms went from 16 per cent to an estimated 50 per cent between 2005 and 2015.

Reflecting the surging sales, Dalian Commodity Exchange soya meal is now the world’s most heavily traded agricultural futures contract.', 'China may be the ancestral home of the soyabean, but its harvests rarely nudge above 15m tonnes. The domestic crop costs more to produce than imports, so demand is mainly sustained by a ban on the use of genetically modified crops in everyday foodstuffs.', 'No such restriction applies to soya used in animal feed and cooking oil, so they now largely come from foreign crops with bioengineered traits such as pesticide resistance. Chinese leaders opened the door to soyabean imports even as they clung to a policy of self-sufficiency in staple food grains.', 'In response, companies are building an increasingly elaborate international soyabean conveyor belt. Cargill, along with China’s New Hope Group and another local partner, in April opened a $100m soyabean crushing plant in a port city near Beijing.

6,Harold Hamm: Natural gas from the USA is going to have a ‘world impact’,2017-06-12T15:09:28+0000,"['The price of oil keeps sliding as an abundance of supply keeps a ceiling on the price — despite the rising tensions in the Middle East — and  is sharply lower over the last 30 days well.', 'In a phone interview with CNBC, Harold Hamm, chairman and CEO of Continental Resources, talked about turmoil between Qatar and its neighbors, the price of liquid natural gas and oil, and the latest on the United States’ first LNG exports to Northern and Central Europe.', 'CNBC: Last Thursday, the White House announced LNG shipments to the Netherlands and Poland — the first American LNG exports into northern and central Europe. You have said in the past that U.S. exports of natural gas to Europe would shake up the geopolitical landscape, because it would relieve Europe from being beholden to Russian natural gas.  Hamm: Yes. The world impact news you are talking about is a huge thing, because Poland has been subservient to Russia, because Russia could hold things over Poland’s head to get what they want. Now it won’t be possible. These exports are also a part of the larger picture of U.S. energy independence. We are now past the point of the U.S. being energy-independent with natural gas. We are shipping around the world, and now with infrastructure being built and put into place, we will continue to export even more through time. This is just the beginning.', 'CNBC: Let’s turn to regulations. LNG facilities needs permits.  Hamm: Yes, and it does not make sense! Why do we need a special permit for LNG? You don’t need a permit for gasoline or oil. To unleash LNG’s potential, we can’t have this permit slowdown! Our company is bullish on natural gas, and this permitting process is putting LNG exploration and production on the sidelines. There is no reason why LNG can’t be exported like crude oil.', 'I have had talks with Secretary Rick Perry at the Department of Energy, and the length of time it takes to get permits approved is one of the things he said he will get fixed. There is no reason to have this long permitting delay. Government just needs to go down the boxes and check them, make sure safety measures are in place, and permits should be given. Some of the first permits for LNG facilities took five years to pass. Some permits took seven years! The Obama administration held them up. That certainly needs to be remedied. We have the cleanest fuel in the world, and yet it is being delayed to the consumer. It can offset the pollution of coal, wood.  CNBC: How does this change the landscape of energy exports and what does this mean for Qatar, which is the world’s largest exporter of natural gas?  Hamm: The Qatar situation certainly brings up the delicate situations that are involved in doing business over there in the Middle East Region. All those tribal factions in Qatar are now coming into play. The fact Iran has been so involved with them is what has brought this about. But this conflict provides opportunity for the United States in exporting our natural gas. We are a neutral nation. Other countries like China or other Qatar customers would not have to worry about anything if they wanted to import U.S. LNG.', 'CNBC: The U.S. is in the early innings of LNG exports. The first shipment of U.S. LNG from the lower 48 states left in February 2016. As infrastructure continues to be built out, what kind of LNG export capacity will we be expecting?  Hamm: It does takes time to build out. With the proposed facilities to be built and facilities already permitted, you can be looking at 11 billion cubic feet a day in the next two years.  CNBC: Where do you see nat gas prices going?  Hamm: We are in for very moderate pricing for nat gas for a lot of years going forward. I feel prices are in a fair range. I think we will be north of the average $3.50 by the end of the year. In 2018, I expect the same. Who knows about where prices go after that? I think we have adequate supply for a hundred years. I think north of three dollars may be the new normal. With the quantities of gas that we produce it would give us a good rate of return at Continental from the plays in which we are involved.', 'CNBC: Oil prices have tumbled to their lowest levels this year amid those tensions between Qatar and its neighbors — Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. Do you see a ceiling on oil prices at this moment?  Hamm: I don’t think we speculate on where it will go. Look what has happened to the market. OPEC decided to flood the market in 2014 and it was a big mistake. OPEC saw shale as a threat and tried to quash it. They failed. It was not the wisest thing they did. They now realize it was a mistake. Last time they killed the market was in the 1980′s and it took a while to turn things around. They decided in January to cut back production. But you have to remember, you need more than 120 days to turn around the impact of the cuts. We are now more than 120 days in, and we are seeing fundamentals changing. Inventories are on a downward trend, but sporadic week to week.', 'CNBC: You said last month in your May 9 shareholder meeting that you saw about a 1 million barrels per day draw-down on oil inventories. How long do you see this playing out to get rid of this overhang in supplies?   Hamm: The biggest challenge is 60 percent of refineries don’t participate in announcing inventories. Only 40 percent participate. It’s an inaccurate mechanism from the start. One week versus another, there’s going to be a huge variance. Two inventories that everyone looks at are API (American Petroleum Institute) and EIA (U.S. Energy Information Administration), and those two last week showed a 2-million barrel difference (between one another). They don’t even jibe. The fact is, this is a choppy situation, but I believe fundamentals are in place. Demand is slightly outpacing supply. Ultimately the production cuts take effect.  CNBC: The EIA is predicting U.S. oil production could rise to a new high record of around 10 million barrels a day. At the pace U.S. shale production is going, when do you see that record being shattered?  Hamm: It all depends on price. Continental has been disciplined. Operators across the U.S. have been also. Across the U.S., fields have not been turned on. Seventy-five percent of rigs have been laid down in the industry. Entire fields have gone undrilled, waiting on better product prices. Four hundred thousand people were laid off in the industry, so it’s going to take a while to get them back. Every operator has a lot of levers to pull and options. It all depends on price.']"

10,How China is changing your dinner plate,2015-10-21T12:07:13+0000,"['California is a massive, food-making machine. The state is the  nation’s largest agricultural producer and exporter. It grows  more than a third of the country’s vegetables, two-thirds of the  nation’s fruits and nuts. Tulare County, in the middle of the  Central Valley, is America’s top dairy producing region.', '  But deep into year four of the drought, many California farmers  have been leveled. The hardship is palpable. Fallowed or idled  land forms brown blocks of dry dirt, littered with brittle  branches, alongside patches of bright green, the watered crops  doted on like a better-loved sibling. With water bills soaring  some tenfold, farmers are making choices about what lives and  what dies.', 'In an increasingly export driven market, California farmers are proving quite adaptable. And more of their decisions hinge on China and the growing role  it’s playing in shaping agriculture, water and food production in  the American West.', '  “The overseas market is extremely important,” says Jesus Ramos, a  farmer who owns 140 acres of mostly citrus trees in Terra Bella  in Tulare County. “That dictates whether you can keep a crop  going or not.”', '  Chinese housewives with more income covet select, imported U.S.  food, but halfway around the world, back in California, some of  the state’s roughly 78,000 farms and ranches are producing more agricultural  products that can require a lot of water to produce, scarce  California water. There’s frustration about how the U.S. is  exporting water through agricultural products to China.', 'Farmers are discerning  about which crops and varieties to water, and which ones to  fallow. Take a crop like oranges. Beyond heft, the sweetest  varieties are preferred, and seedless is better than seeds.  Consumers are picky about food. They hover over mountains of  stacked oranges in search of produce perfection. ', '  Born in Mexico, Ramos came to America as a young crew picker.  During harvest, the work pace is furious. Pickers scurry up  ladders with palm-sized clippers to cut oranges off stems. Nearly  all oranges in the world are cut by hand this way. Snip, snip,  snip. A landowner and grandfather now, Ramos fully grasps the  gamble that is farming. “You can lose your life savings in just a  couple of years.”', '  Walking around one of his six ranches in August, blocks of citrus  trees behind him, Ramos’ young picking days seem simple compared  to the global demands of modern farming. The water bill for one  10-acre ranch, for example, jumped to $33,000 in 2014 from  $3,200 in 2013. His total water bill for all his ranches has  soared to more than $200,000, compared to roughly $17,000 just a  few years ago. Beyond managing water costs, an export-focused  citrus crop can trigger food production changes mandated by  overseas markets. China, for example, requires controlling and  documenting the Fuller rose beetle as a condition of receiving  imports there. While not a major threat, the beetle is common in  Tulare County citrus.', 'Pest control? Check. Water costs? Check, check. Then Ramos  worries about how his perfect round orbs of fruit will travel on  shipping containers to key Asian markets, including South Korea  and China. Skins that peel easily are preferred, but not so thin  they’ll get bruised and crushed during the weekslong  transportation journey. “I prioritize firmer fruits that can  withstand the shipping time,” Ramos explained.', 'As if farming wasn’t enough of a juggling act, producers of  commodities ranging from citrus to almonds are wary of  China’s slowing economy, the world’s second largest. There’s worry  the downturn could hurt demand for California’s food bounty. “All  of the sudden, you have to be concerned your fruit may not move  in Asia,” said Ramos.', '  He has fallowed some of his Tulare County land, and put 25 acres  up for sale in 2014 amid scarce water. No buyers yet. “If you  drive around, you’ll notice a lot of ‘for sale’ signs,” he said.', '  Sandwiched between San Francisco and Los Angeles, the great  Central Valley is roughly 450 miles long and 40 to 60 miles wide.  From Interstate 5, head inland onto state Route 99. Neat crop  aisles whip past you. Roll down the window to the tangy odor of  manure and, sometimes, the sweet fragrance of citrus tree flowers in  bloom. If you peel off 99 and slow down at dusk, listen for the  rustle of olive and almond tree branches against the faint wind.  It’s here in the arid, rolling hills of the Central Valley that  Ramos is fighting to maintain his land with little water.', '  Rain always in the back of his mind, he keeps busy farming. He  tidies his property down to wrenches, hung on nails and arranged  by size like small soldiers. He drives down each citrus aisle in  one of several utility vehicles — all with names including a  green one called “Moco,” Spanish for snot or booger. “You have to  have a sense of humor about these things.”', '  By humor, Ramos also means doing the best you can during dry and  wet years. The state’s agriculture complex pushed back against  surface water shortages by pumping more groundwater, or liquid  tucked underneath the earth’s surface.', '  And in this vortex of water allotments and politics, perhaps no  agricultural products expose the collision of rising China demand  and U.S. food production quite like hay, dairy products and  almonds. Crop reports and export data show these select  commodities making big export gains as they’re desired by China’s  growing middle class.', '“There are likely many smaller commodities that will get a  similar boost of demand from China,” said Ryland Maltsbarger, an  agricultural economist at IHS. “China will remain a significant  influencer on the global food system.”', '  As China’s incomes expand and appetites shift to embrace more  foreign food, smaller farms like Ramos’ are getting on with the  business of farming. Previous drought years have flattened cash-flow cushions. Many farmers are in their 50s and older. They’ve  drained retirement accounts and savings for children to pay for  water. This winter, they’re praying for El Niño, a  naturally occurring weather pattern that can bring heavy  precipitation. With federal forecasters calling for a greater  than 90 percent chance that El Niño will last all winter for  the Northern Hemisphere, farmers and ranchers are placing one  more bet on rain-soaked land. The outcome could impact what’s on  our dinner plates for years to come.', '  Daniel Putnam has been a plant and soil scientist for some 30  years. Now at the University of California, Davis, he researches  how to boost land productivity, or raise more food on the same  amount of soil. As the drought has lingered, he’s been getting  some phone calls about one particular water-thirsty crop:  alfalfa hay, used to feed livestock including cows to produce  milk products. In the vast basket of agricultural crops,  high-margin almonds are the hot girls at the party. Pistachios,  walnuts, easy-to-peel tangelos are way popular. But alfalfa? Hay  is hay — unless you throw China into the mix.', '  While exporting U.S. hay is not new, shipments to Asia and the  Middle East have climbed in recent years, according to USDA data.  Japan imports a lot of U.S. hay, but shipments to China have  vaulted from near zero in the mid-2000s to roughly 1 million  metric tons as forecasted for 2015, according to UC Davis and  industry estimates. While China’s appetite for exported hay from  Western states is growing, the commodity’s biggest market remains  domestic dairies, as well as feed for horses, beef and  sheep.', '  Despite China’s vast landmass, plants and vegetation on land for  grazing animals is relatively scarce. And with China’s growing  appetite for protein — including dairy products — more  Chinese farmers are importing hay — particularly from Western  U.S. states. While exporting U.S. hay is not new, shipments to  Asia and the Middle East have climbed in recent years, according  to USDA data.', 'The rub for some water experts is U.S. hay producers’ shipping of water-intensive hay halfway around the world on shipping  containers — in the middle of a drought. “When I found out  we were shipping bales of hay across the world, you could have  knocked me over with a feather,” said Robert Glennon, a water  resource expert at the University of Arizona. “And I’m a water  guy,” said Glennon, also author of “Unquenchable.” ', 'He estimates 2 million tons of Western alfalfa hay, which required 100 billion gallons of water to produce, was  shipped overseas, including to Asia, in 2014. Glennon’s larger  point is the need for a coherent, domestic agricultural policy  that treats water as a precious resource.', '  The hay market’s peculiarities also raise larger questions about  the value of exporting more agricultural products in a global  economy. California and the U.S. agriculture complex feed the  world. But there’s a finite amount of arable land and limited  water supplies. And the planet will only get more crowded. The  world’s population will reach 9.7 billion by 2050, up from the  current 7.3 billion, according to United Nations figures. Who’s going to produce the food to feed the world? The California  drought will end, eventually. And it will rain again. But  researchers wonder what happens during the next round, when the  planet is more populated and hotter?', '  Piling on to the moral question about exporting “virtual” water,  the staggering U.S.-China trade imbalance incentivizes American  producers to take advantage of shipping container “empties” that  might otherwise return to Asia unfilled. Shipping goods such as hay  from California’s Imperial Valley, east of San Diego, to Tulare  County in the Central Valley can run $60 to $70 a ton, estimates  Putnam of UC Davis. Transporting the same batch of goods from  Long Beach, California, to a port in Asia is a relative bargain  at roughly $25 to $45 a ton. Turns out you can make money  shipping something — even hay and recycled cardboard —  to China on an “empty.” ', '  Shipping hay to China makes some people uncomfortable because it  illustrates how America’s economy is shaped by domestic producers  that export raw materials, which China converts into finished  goods. Cotton for jeans, lumber for furniture. So instead of just  exporting commodities, some American farmers have figured out how  to keep hay on U.S. soil and produce finished milk products  domestically for export to international markets.', 'With roots stretching to Denmark, fourth-generation dairyman Pete Olsen and his two brothers farm 1,700 acres of  alfalfa, corn and rye at Hillside Dairy in Fallon in western  Nevada. In between milking cows and managing the dairy, Olsen has  traveled the world — including to China — and probably  knows more than most about food production in a growing export  economy.', '  In September 2014, Olsen, regional farmers and local economic  developers did something you don’t hear about every day. The  group opened an $85 million dairy manufacturing plant on U.S.  soil. The facility encompasses the whole supply chain —  local hay feed for cows to the final end product of dry milk  powder, sifted into bags for export to overseas markets, including  China.', 'The plant was designed by the Dairy Farmers of America, which  includes more than 14,000 dairy producers. It processes 1.5  million pounds of raw milk daily into 250,000 pounds of whole  milk powder that’s shipped to consumers globally. Regional  farmers sell their crops, including alfalfa hay and milk to the  plant, with the end product bound for the port of Oakland,  California, and then store shelves around the world. “For us as  dairymen, the plant provides long-term stability,” Olsen said.  “You know you’re going to have someone to sell to.” And that  “someone” includes China.', 'Chinese moms and housewives have long sought dry milk powder  because it’s a protein-rich food that boasts a long shelf life. The percentage of U.S. dairy goods exported to China has  climbed to roughly 15 percent from around 5 percent since 2008,  when tainted baby formula lead to several infant deaths and  thousands of sick babies. Chinese milk products were found to  contain melamine, a chemical used to manufacture plastics and  fertilizer that can cause kidney stones and kidney failure. When  added to agricultural products, the chemical can indicate higher  protein content.', '  Back in America, dairy producers noticed rising global demand for  safe, “Made in USA” milk products and boosted production for  overseas markets. U.S. dairy farmers joined other big,  international exporters including New Zealand. In the past  decade, U.S. dairy export value to China has soared to $692.6  million in 2014 from $59.2 million in 2004, according to USDA  data. The massive gains reflect the 2008 melamine scare and  rising Chinese demand for dairy. But China’s broader economy is  retreating to slower growth, and milk imports there have shifted  into lower gear. In the first half of 2015, China’s dairy imports  as measured in the equivalent of milk were down 35 percent from  last year, according to analysis from the U.S. Dairy Export  Council.', 'Despite China’s recent downturn, milk imports in China will  remain significant over the long haul. Growing hay for feed is  difficult in China. Unlike America, China’s farming complex is a patchwork of microfarms — a few acres down to mini  scattered plots — that makes scalable food production  challenging.', 'That’s good news for the 45-employee Nevada plant that was  designed to make dairy products to the specifications of  international customers including a preference for whole milk  powder. As more agricultural products are manufactured and  tailored for export — especially to China and other rapidly  developing nations — producers are building global market  share and moving up the food chain, literally. “The local milk  supply is a big deal for our global customers who want to know  where their dairy products come from,” Olsen said. “In China,  they want to know it came off the shelf in the United States.”', '  China and the world loves California almonds. The state’s almond  cash receipts surged for the fourth consecutive year in the 2013  crop year, as revenue rose to $5.77 billion, according to USDA  figures. Though everyone from corporate farms to crew  pickers is feeling the pinch of parched weather, almond farmers  comparatively are hurting less. And despite the almond industry’s  improved irrigation practices, the water-intensive crop has  become a target for scrutiny.', '  “We are a very visible industry in California that has grown  dramatically over the last 20 years,” said third-generation  farmer Tom Rogers. He owns a 175-acre almond farm in Madera,  California, northwest of Fresno, and produces some 2,500 pounds of  almonds per acre.', '  Next year will mark the farm’s 100th year in operation since  Rogers’ grandparents immigrated from Italy. Up until the late  ’70s, the Rogers family had grown cotton, alfalfa hay, corn and  raised some cattle. But Rogers’ late father had a hunch about  almonds — long before consumers began reaching for snacking  almonds, almond milk, almond butter and a broad variety of  plant-based proteins. “He was willing to look out and try  different things,” said Rogers.', '  His water bill for his almond farm has soared 50 to 100 percent  during the drought, as he’s pumped more groundwater to irrigate  crops. Groundwater flows naturally to the top, or can be pumped  up through wells. For the past two years, Rogers has received no  surface water supplies found in rivers, lakes and reservoirs, and has relied purely on groundwater.', 'This is not a sustainable business model for any farmer or  rancher. A few years ago, his annual surface water costs ranged  from $25,000 to $30,000. More recently he paid around $150,000 in  well repairs alone. And that first patch of almonds his father  planted in 1979? Rogers fallowed the older field in November last  year, as the older trees were producing less crop.', '  If you linger in an agricultural county, you’ll find folks old  enough to recall when farmers began pulling up apple trees to  make room for fancier crops in the Central Valley. The bottom  line is nuts and other specialty foods can be lucrative. Nuts  including almonds are shaken off trees and scooped off the ground  by machines, which means low labor costs and strong cash flows.  “Why wouldn’t anyone take a chance on a crop if it turns a  profit?” Rogers asked.', 'But food production choices have a broad reach in a global  agricultural economy. Almonds and other specialty crops can  require more water to produce. And it’s tough to turn your back  on an almond investment, despite high water costs, when global  demand for nuts including almonds is so strong. About 60 to 70  percent of California almonds are sold internationally.', '  In China, almonds are especially popular in autumn and winter.  Packaged nuts are an appreciated Lunar New Year gift. Almonds and  nuts are also a hit on China’s Singles’ Day, a big commerce day  that’s like America’s Black Friday. Nuts are popular because more  Chinese consumers are growing health conscious.', 'More Chinese consumers are also concerned about food safety and  seek imports. “If you have money and if the product is made  outside of China, the feeling is you have a bit more trust,” said  Jeff Walters of The Boston Consulting Group. “If you cruise a  food market in China and stroll down the nut aisle, the bags of  almonds are likely from California. Take a moment to inspect the  almond bag’s “Made in USA” labeling.  “The packaging will  have an American flag on it,” Walters said.', '  China’s growing appetite for nuts and more protein reflect larger  shifts among its middle class. The share of China’s urban  households with disposable incomes — high enough to afford  cars and small luxury items — is forecast to reach about 57  percent by 2020, according to forecasts from consultancy  McKinsey. While China broadly can feed its own people, the  food preferences of China’s higher earners — and their  growing appetite for Western-grown specialty crops — are  likely to reverberate throughout the agricultural landscape for  years to come. Food consumption patterns for many developing  regions follow a familiar path in tandem with rising incomes. “As  people get more wealthy, they tend to spend more money and tend  to go for high-quality food,” said Hal Sirkin, a senior partner  at The Boston Consulting Group. “That’s a universal trait.”', 'And whether talking about nuts or specialized dairy products,  there’s a larger philosophical question: Which crops feed more  people? As more farmers pursue high-value specialty crops —  many of them essentially luxury crops — and away from staple  crops, not everyone can afford the more expensive food that often  requires more water to produce. The elephant in the room is  whether an economic-driven preference for high-value crops over  low-value varieties is creating the equivalent of a 1 percent and  99 percent in our food complex. “It’s ironically the low-value  crops like rice, wheat, alfalfa that impacts everybody’s diet,  every day,” said Putnam of UC Davis. And farmers aren’t dummies. They’re  savvy, gambling start-up guys in overalls.', '  Lorren Wheaton farms citrus in Tulare County, not far from Ramos.  Wheaton’s late father farmed corn and raised cattle in the  Nebraska sandhills. Christmas back then brought an orange, apple,  nuts, some penny hard candy and maybe a repainted toy or two. In  the 1940s, the family headed west to California. Wheaton  eventually settled in Terra Bella. In the past two years, he has  shelled out $1 million-plus to keep his 300 acres alive in hopes  of a rain-soaked crop year.', '  It’s late afternoon and Wheaton relaxes in a living room chair,  flanked by photos of his children and grandchildren. Regional  Friant-Kern Canal authorities have allowed no surface water  deliveries for the past two years — the first time for zero  surface allotments since 1952. “If you do everything you can to  survive and you don’t make it, you can’t feel bad about it,”  Wheaton said. “It’s up to the land.”', '  Wheaton, Ramos and many other farmers are all fixated on El  Niño, a naturally occurring phenomenon that happens every  three to five years. When water temperatures rise in the eastern  Pacific during El Niño events, the warmer ocean  temperatures also alter the path and strength of high-level  atmospheric winds called jet streams. These powerful winds rake  across the Pacific from the west to east. Thunderstorms need some  warmth and humid air. So El Niño — and its supply of  warm ocean temperatures — triggers a lot of persistent  thunderstorms in the tropics. And these thunderstorms in the  tropical Pacific Ocean have significant impacts across the entire  Northern Hemisphere, including California.', '  “We do expect that this winter won’t be like it has been in the  last two winters in California,” said Todd Crawford, chief  meteorologist at WSI, a catastrophic weather forecaster, based in  Andover, Massachusetts. “But how wet, we don’t know yet.” But  early forecasts already suggest this El Niño could be  among the strongest on record before all is said and done.', '  The strong El Niño event has fueled some speculation it  might stretch well beyond spring 2016, into some kind of  back-to-back El Niño. But Crawford notes stronger El  Niño events typically weaken rather quickly. “El  Niño will likely end fairly quickly during early 2016,” he  said. “It would be a shock to have a conversation a year from now  about the current El Niño event.”', '  But forecasts don’t matter at the moment to laborers in Tulare  County. Three men — Victor Diaz, Fernando Hernandez and  Roman Moreno — break up remaining branches of citrus trees  that have been left to die for lack of water in the August heat.  The dry dirt is surprisingly dense and pliable. It’s like  stepping into deep, fluffy sand that compresses and collapses  under your shoes’ weight. The branches will be shipped to a  processor for mulching.', '  “We need rain,” said Diaz, who is from Porterville and has worked  and lived in the area all his life. Taking a break, Diaz leans  against a beat-up compact car, and crosses both sets of fingers.  “We are praying to baby Jesus that El Niño comes.”', 'It’s the tail end of summer and quieter in the Central Valley.

We’re really looking to kick it into an unprecedented flight rate” after testing is complete, Beck told CNBC. ', 'The mission, titled “Still Testing,” deployed three satellites. One was an Earth-imaging Dove satellites built by Planet, and the other were Lemur-2 satellites that monitor weather and track ships, built by Spire. ', '“This is the first test carrying customer payloads and we’ll be monitoring everything closely as we attempt to reach orbit,” Beck said. “This is not just about getting to orbit. We’re really looking to get all the data we can.”', 'In December, Electron missed its 10-day window after delays from weather and a last second abort. Rocket Lab had counted all the way down to T-minus 2 seconds, when Beck says Electron automatically aborted.', '“The engines ignited but a couple engines didn’t like the temperature of the liquid oxygen, so it automatically shut down,” Beck said. ', 'Rocket Lab had at least one more chance at launching in December, but Beck says “the weather didn’t look good enough.” ', 'Electron’s success comes at a critical time, as Rocket Lab has contracted to launch five rockets for lunar mining company Moon Express as early as next spring.', ' Rocket Lab said previously that the results of the “Still Testing” launch, if the rocket “performs nominally,” may cause the company to accelerate the Electron program into commercial use. At $5 million per Electron vehicle, Rocket Lab is now much closer to having the low cost rocket it wants to launch at high volume. ', '“There’s a tremendous number of things in place that enables us to ramp up production that way,” Beck said. ', 'This was the second of three planned test launches. In May, the first Electron vehicle failed to reach orbit. CEO Peter Beck said at the time the problems involved “third-party error” and were fixed. No major change was made to Electron’s hardware between the tests.', 'Beck says the company will continue to base launches out of New Zealand, saying “right now we have all the capacity we need.” As launches increase, Beck says that talks are ongoing with several spaceports and launch locations around the United States for future Rocket Lab flights.', '“We’re talking to Cape Canaveral, Kodiak in Alaska, and have a great relationship with Wallops,” Beck said.

13,Forget rockets: This ‘space elevator’ could launch you into orbit,2015-08-19T06:40:49+0000,"['  A Canadian company has clinched a patent for a 12.4 mile-high  “space elevator” that could launch astronauts and tourists into  orbit.', '  The free-standing tower would essentially be inflated, supported  by a series of gas-pressurized cells, and serve as a docking  platform for space planes that could launch cargo, tourists and  satellites directly into lower orbit. ', '  Thoth Technology, the Ontario-based company behind the invention,  told CNBC the elevator could transport 10 tons of cargo at  approximately seven miles per hour, with passengers able to reach  the top of the tower in about 60 minutes. Passengers could then  board a space plane that could reach lower orbit  without  the need for costly a rocket launch.', '  The elevator weighs about the same amount as a super crude tanker  ship and is expected to cost about $5 billion to build. Thoth  Technology said that once built, it will reduce the cost of  reaching low Earth orbit by 30 percent compared to conventional  rockets.', '  Traditional rocket launches can cost upwards of $250 million,  while cheaper commercial offerings like those offered by SpaceX  — the commercial aerospace company founded by Elon  Musk— lists the launch price of its Falcon 9 rocket at $61.2  million and it’s Falcon Heavy model at $90 million. ', '  The inventor of the “space elevator” is Brendan Quine, an  engineering professor at York University in Toronto and  co-founder of Thoth Technology. He said the team behind the  elevator worked on the concept for eight years before securing  the U.S. patent in July. ', '  “Other inflated tower designs have been explored previously, but  they typically use buttress designs or support cables that we  believe [are] impractical,” Quine told CNBC.  ', '  Graham Warwick, a managing editor at Aviation Week, said that the  aerospace industry had been looking for a cheaper way to launch  goods and people for decades. ', '  “Single-stage-to-orbit from the ground has so far proved  impossible and a true space elevator (stretching all the way into  space) would be hideously expensive to construct if we knew how,  so this is another way to do it,” Warwick told CNBC. ', '  “Once built — if built, and if it works — this would  seem to offer easier, more routine access to space. For  spacecraft and for people.” ', '  The next step for Thoth is to build a 0.9-mile-tall demonstration  elevator, before building the full  12.4 mile-high tower.  Even the demonstration tower would be the world’s largest  structure, Quine explained. ', '  Quine said that there was little to hold back development, since  all of the technology required to build the elevator was readily  available, adding that a demonstration elevator could be built  within three years, and a full version within five years. ', '  Once built, Warwick said there might be further commercial  opportunities, especially for tourism. ', '  “It could house hotels and restaurants that would provide the  experience of being in space without the potential discomfort of  zero gravity,” he said. ', '  Quine didn’t give any names, but said there has been “intense  interest” in the space elevator’s patent rights. ']"
14,How 2017 became a turning point for tech giants,2017-12-13T14:03:37+0000,"['This was a terrible year for the tech industry.', 'That’s an odd thing to say at a time of record growth and profits. In 2017, large American tech companies have kept hauling in more money, more users, and — to a degree that might seem dystopian — they continued to expand their foothold in our lives. This was a year in which Amazon created a way for its delivery drivers to let themselves into your house, and Apple created a phone you can unlock with your face.', 'Yet underneath this apparent success was a momentous shift in how the tech business deals with the world. Five or 10 years from now, we will come to regard 2017 as a turning point.', 'Why? Because this year, for the first time, tech giants began to grudgingly accept that they have some responsibility to the offline world. The scope of that responsibility, though, is another matter entirely.', 'Let me explain how this is all playing out.', '“Platforms” are the shiniest prizes in the tech business. The reason the five most valuable American tech companies — Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Alphabet and Microsoft — are also the five most valuable American companies of any kind is that they own these fundamental building blocks of the digital economy, whether they are operating systems, app stores, social networks, cloud servers, or shipping and logistics infrastructure.', 'Think of these platforms as the roads, railroads and waterways of the information economy — an essentially inescapable part of life for any business or regular person who doesn’t live in a secluded cabin in the woods.', 'For years, despite their growing power, tech platforms rarely garnered much scrutiny, and they were often loathe to accept how much their systems affected the real world. Indeed, the online ethos has been that platforms aren’t really responsible for how people use them. It might as well be the slogan of Silicon Valley: We just make the tech, how people use it is another story.', 'In 2017, that changed. At first grudgingly and then with apparent enthusiasm, platform companies like Facebook began accepting some responsibility for how they are affecting the real world. They did not go as far as some critics would have liked — but in many significant ways they offered a shift in tone and tactics that suggested they were rethinking their positions.', 'You could argue that they had no choice. In the past year, social networks and search engines have been blamed for undermining the news media, fostering echo chambers, and spreading misinformation, hate, misogyny and other general social unpleasantness (YouTube, for example, removed lots of videos of kids gets getting pretend-tortured by their parents). There was also, of course, the unfolding saga of the companies’ role in Russia’s propaganda efforts, which resulted in them being hauled before lawmakers.', 'And then there were the larger questions about who makes the platforms and who benefits from them. The tech industry is overwhelmingly run by men, and it is a place of little racial and class diversity. A whistle-blowing blog post by Susan Fowler, an engineer who detailed a culture of harassment and misogyny at the ride-hailing company Uber, sparked a women’s movement in tech that was then subsumed by the global #MeToo movement.', 'Many tech titans were obviously unprepared for the serious questions that began coming their way a year ago. When the Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was asked about his site’s role in the 2016 election just days after Donald J. Trump’s victory, he responded with a line from tech’s old playbook: It was a “pretty crazy idea,” he said, that misinformation on Facebook had “influenced the election in any way.”', 'Now that tone is gone. Mr. Zuckerberg has apologized for his glibness. And during Facebook’s last earnings report to investors, he put the company’s social mission at the top of his agenda. “Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits,” he said.', 'Several other tech execs have expressed similar commitments to a deeper mission. Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, told my colleague Andrew Ross Sorkin that Apple has a “moral responsibility” to attempt to heal the nation’s social and economic fissures.', 'More from The New York Times:', 'Google, Looking to Tiptoe Back into China, Announces A.I. CenterNet Neutrality Protests Move Online, Yet Big Tech Is QuietI Was Wrong About Bitcoin. Here’s Why.', 'Sure, all this could just be marketing. But I’m inclined to believe the shift represents a new way of navigating the world, for a few reasons.', 'First, employees are demanding a new way. The highly paid workers of Silicon Valley were lured on the promise of changing the world, and in the past year many became demoralized about their companies’ apparent impact. In some cases they’re pushing their bosses to change.', 'Second, for the first time in years, there’s real pressure from lawmakers. That has resulted in some real-world retreats. For instance, tech giants last month stopped fighting a bill in Congress that would allow victims of sex trafficking to sue websites that supported the sex trade. In another time, this would have been a gimme for tech companies — they aren’t responsible for how people use their services, remember?', 'Not this time.', 'If the big shift of 2017 is that tech companies now accept some responsibility for how their platforms impact the world, the big mystery of 2018 and beyond is what, exactly, that responsibility will look like.', 'Mr. Zuckerberg said he was willing to risk the company’s profitability to improve its community. Facebook has been testing new ideas for making its News Feed less divisive and less prone to misinformation, and for promoting what the company calls “meaningful” social connections. Facebook is also testing systems that it said would more stringently police advertising, in the hope of preventing foreign actors from using its ad network to influence an election.', 'And in response to criticism from former Facebook employees that its tech might be addictive, the company said this week that it has conducted extensive research on the subject and was “using it to inform our product development.”', 'But what if these early efforts don’t mitigate the problems? What if Facebook finds that offering people a less polarized News Feed dramatically reduces engagement on its site, affecting its bottom line? Or what if the changes disproportionately affect one political ideology over another — would Facebook stick with a kind of responsibility that risks calling into question its impartiality?', 'I don’t mean to offer a barrage of hypotheticals just for the fun of it. My point is that these issues would probably be pretty hard to solve.', '“Just as the packaged food industry did in the 1950s, Facebook and Google have lured users with convenience, while feeding them a diet certain to cause lasting harm,” Roger McNamee, the musician and venture capitalist, told me. “The problem cannot be addressed by hiring; it can only be fixed by changing the algorithms in ways that will materially reduce profitability.”', 'Or consider the question of diversity. I asked Ellen Pao — the former Reddit chief executive who unsuccessfully sued the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers for gender discrimination — what she made of the industry’s efforts to address the issue this year.', '“I would give tech a C grade,” Ms. Pao, who is now the chief diversity and inclusion officer at the Kapor Center for Social Impact, wrote in an email. “Leaders are doing the bare minimum to address problems and are far from doing all that is necessary to solve the problem.”', 'She said she hoped for a far more vigorous effort that ushered in a complete overhaul of the culture of tech companies, and that held leaders accountable.', '“It means firing all the people involved in the failures, from the C.E.O. to the H.R. leaders to the board members in some cases,” she wrote.', 'Ms. Pao’s and Mr. McNamee’s comments underline the real problem for the industry. Once you accept that you’re on the hook for fixing problems caused by the thing you built, people will start to expect that you really will fix them — even if the solutions are expensive or otherwise conflict with your business interests.', 'So, yeah, 2017 was a terrible year for the tech industry. If the fixing does not actually happen, 2018 might well be worse.', 'Email: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjoo.']"

But he never received a penny. ', '  According to a $1.5 million fraud and breach of contract lawsuit Berg filed against Amazon in  October, the e-tailer tried to change the terms of the deal and  force Berg to accept “improper price concessions” when  cheaper hoverboards began showing up on its  marketplace.

Berg agreed to an offer at one point, suspecting the company was negotiating in bad faith since Amazon didn’t have the hoverboards available that they were promising. After all, he could still see the inventory levels.

A simple search for hoverboards on Amazon.com returns pages of self-balancing scooters and peripherals.', 'Unlike last year’s free-for-all, there are restrictions today.

22,"South Korean consumer sentiment, reforms at risk amid political crisis",2016-12-01T02:19:36+0000,"['  Political uncertainty from South Korea’s Choi-gate has left the  outlook for Asia’s fourth-largest economy looking as cloudy as a  glass of makgeolli, a traditional Korean rice liquor.', '  The country’s 64-year old head of state, Park Geun-Hye, surrendered  her powers to parliament on Tuesday after prosecutors  labelled her a co-conspirator in an influence-peddling case,  dubbed Choi-gate, involving her close friend Choi Sun-sil. It’s  unclear when Park will officially resign, or if her future lies  in impeachment instead. Opposition parties intend to introduce an  impeachment motion in parliament as early as Friday.', '  Even before the scandal hit, South Korea was already battling an  economic morass. Over the past two years, exports have only seen  one month of gains amid a slowdown in China, the country’s  largest trading partner. Meanwhile, household debt hit an  all-time high in the third quarter this year and youth  unemployment stands at a record high of 9.4 percent.', '  Weakening consumer sentiment and a slow pace of reforms may  soon be new additions to that list amid President Park’s  looming exit.', '  “Park’s position of not resigning immediately puts the political,  legislative and economic process at stake. There will now be  instability as to who’s putting policies forward,” Stephen Nagy,  associate professor at Tokyo’s International Christian  University, told CNBC’s “Street Signs.”', '  The economic damage was already bubbling up. Last week, central  bank data showed confidence among South Korean consumers hit a  seven-year low in November, with Citi economists attributing the  dismal performance to political unrest.', '  “The economy faces more downside risks now as consumer and  investor sentiment contract, caused by the recent political  situation,” finance minister Yoo Il-ho said during a Wednesday  speech, according to Reuters.', '  As a result of the muddled political environment, Natixis  investment bank expected gross domestic product (GDP) growth to  slow to 2.5 percent in 2016 and 2.4 percent in 2017, from 2.6  percent last year.', '  Moreover, policy decision-making will likely be stalled until the  country gets more clarity on Park’s fate and timing of the next  presidential election, now widely expected to occur before the  originally expected December 2017.  However, that will  likely derail urgent reforms needed in the labor market.', '  Park’s administration wanted to allow companies more freedom when  it comes to hiring and firing workers as well as to expand a  performance-based salary system, moves aimed at boosting  competitiveness, but which opposition parties had vehemently  resisted.  In the aftermath of the scandal, such reforms  were “effectively dead in the water,” according to political  consultancy Eurasia.', '  In the corporate space, meanwhile, calls are growing for  structural change at top chaebols, or family-run conglomerates,  amid a slew of recent woes. But those calls were unlikely to be  heard by a government still focused on Choi-gate.', '  In August, Hanjin Shipping filed  for bankruptcy, while Lotte Group’s  vice-chairman committed suicide. September saw  fresh worker strikes at  Hyundai Motor, while Samsung Electronics recalled its Galaxy  Note 7 smartphone from the market last month. Problems  at these blue-chip chaebols were weakening Korea’s brand globally  and helping depress the economy, Nagy noted.', '  Chaebols are the backbone of the Korean economy, but they are  often linked with unfair business practices and uneven power  distribution, resulting in widespread calls for massive  restructuring and better governance. Several, including Samsung,  LG, SK Group, Hanwha, Hanjin and Posco, were being investigated  after they were found to be implicated in Choi-gate, adding to  growing public frustration.', '  But the messy political situation implied “limited space for  policy progress to address structural weakness,” Natixis warned  in a recent note.', '  Still, there’s more hope for labor reforms because of sizable  support from the opposition.', '  Parliament is expected to pass several bills designed to tighten  laws for chaebols before the current session ends on Dec. 9.  These new laws will make it more difficult for chaebols to engage  in collusion, maintain nepotistic control of operations,  excessively compensate executives and exert undue political  influence, Eurasia said in a report this week.', '  Legislation to raise corporate income taxes, a major feature of  the opposition’s policy agenda, to 25 percent for firms with net  assets exceeding 50 billion won ($45 million), from 22 percent  previously, was also on track to be passed alongside the 2017  budget on Dec. 2, Eurasia continued.', '  But while higher taxes can expand government coffers, they could  ultimately hurt GDP.', '  “The increase of corporate tax rates will put pressures on Korean  companies that are already beleaguered by excess global capacity,  industrial restructuring in sectors such as ship building and  marine shipping, and increased competition externally. The  short-term impact will likely be negative for economic growth,”  Natixis said.', ' —Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.']"
23,The 141 Stances Donald Trump Took During His White House Bid,2016-11-28T20:41:08+0000,"['  President-Elect Donald Trump took 141 distinct stances on 23  major issues during his bid for the White House.', '  His campaign’s constantly-evolving views — often championed  as a way for Trump to use unpredictability to cut better deals  for the nation — make it difficult glean a political agenda,  or even a set of clear, core policy views ahead of his  presidency.', '  It’s unclear, for example, if Trump plans to round up and deport  the nation’s estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants or give  them a pathway to citizenship. After announcing he’d ban Muslims  from entering the country ten months ago, it’s unclear if that  policy still stands -- his campaign some times says he’s expanded  the policy and other times that he’s limited it.', '  After more than a year and a half of stadium rallies,  around-the-clock interviews, sweeping primary wins, and one  stunning general election victory, the Republican president-elect  has the most contradictory and confusing platform in recent  history. This is a catalog of his views over a 511-day span, from  June 16, 2015 to November 8, 2016.', ' More from NBC News:Marco Rubio says ‘our goal is not to punish’  Cubans with U.S. policyClinton campaign backs Jill Stein’s election  recount effort: lawyerWith no evidence, Trump claims ‘millions’ voted illegally', ' IMMIGRATION', '  1. Build a wall, deport all undocumented immigrants.', '  Trump’s campaign began with a promise to build a wall across the  United States’ southern border and deport the country’s  11 million undocumented immigrants.', '  2. Deport all undocumented immigrants but bring the “good” ones  back legally.', '  In a CNN interview in July 2015, Trump said, “I want to move them  out, and we’re going to move them back in and let them be legal,  but they have to be in here legally.”', '  3. Build the wall, deport criminals, triple the number of ICE  officers, end birthright citizenship.', '  In August 2015, Trump released a detailed, sprawling immigration  plan that included a wide variety of ideas: Build the wall, make  Mexico pay for it, deport criminal aliens, enhance penalties for  overstaying visas, triple the number of ICE officers, pause  immigration to try and employ unemployed Americans, cut worker  visas and more. Trump’s plan didn’t detail how he’d enact most of  his proposals, or how he’d pay for them. He’s walked back or  modified much of it since.', '  4. Use a deportation force to implement policy.', '  In November 2015, Trump said he’d use a mass deportation force in  order to remove the 11 million people.', '  “You’re going to have a deportation force. And your going to do  it humanely,” Trump said in November on MSNBC.', '  5. Trump might be flexible on actually deporting 11 million  undocumented immigrants.', '  BuzzFeed reported in February 2016 that in off-the-record talks  with The New York Times, Trump admitted this was just bluster and  a starting point for negotiations, saying he might not deport the  undocumented immigrants as he’s promised. Trump has refused calls  to release the transcript, despite furious requests from his  rival candidates.', '  6. Deport undocumented immigrants, but don’t call it “mass  deportations.”', '  “President Obama has mass deported vast numbers of people —  the most ever, and it’s never reported. I think people are going  to find that I have not only the best policies, but I will have  the biggest heart of anybody,” Trump told Bloomberg News in June  2016 when pressed about his immigration policies.', '  When asked more about how he’d characterize the deportations at  the center of his immigration policy, Trump said he “would not  call it mass deportations.”', '  7. A deportation force is “TBD.”', '  Trump’s newly hired campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, dodged  questions on the deportation force in August 2016 before saying  that Trump’s much-talked about deportation force from the primary  was “to be determined.”', '  8. “I’m gonna do the same” as past presidents.', '  Trump championed President Obama’s immigration strategy —  deporting criminals first — in an interview with Fox News on  Monday, August 22 when asked about how he’d deport 11 million  illegal immigrants. He declined to answer questions of how he’d  handle those who aren’t criminals.', '  9. I’m open to “softening.”', '  The next day, Trump told attendees of a town hall hosted by Fox  News in Texas that he was open to “softening” laws to help  immigrants already living in the United States peacefully.  However, he followed that by saying that those who had overstayed  visas — one of the key ways undocumented immigrants get into  the U.S. — had to leave. “You have to get them out. You have  to get them out,” Trump said.', '  It’s unclear what or how he’s softening his policy.', '  10. “There’s no amnesty” but “we work with them.”', '  In an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity that aired Wednesday,  August 24, Trump outlined an immigration plan that sounded an  awful lot like the kind of path to legalization championed by  Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio — the very people  Trump excoriated for weak immigration plans while he campaigned  on a promise of mass deportations.', '  “No citizenship. Let me go a step further — they’ll pay  back-taxes, they have to pay taxes, there’s no amnesty, as such,  there’s no amnesty, but we work with them,” Trump said.', '  11. Deport “criminal illegal immigrants” within one hour of being  sworn in.', '  Trump worked to sound strong on illegal immigration at an event  in Iowa on Saturday, August 27 — even if he was simply  presenting a warp-speed version of current policy.', '  “On day one, I am going to begin swiftly removing criminal  illegal immigrants from this country,” he said. “We are going to  get rid of the criminals, and it will happen within one hour” of  being sworn in.', '  Trump did not discuss how he would approach the millions of other  undocumented immigrants, nor did he explain how he could  accomplish implementing current policy so quickly.', '  12. What’s the plan again?', '  On Sunday, August 28, three Trump surrogates took to the airwaves  to insist that Trump’s immigration plan hadn’t changed. But their  answers on what that plan actually was — and is — only  added to the confusion.', '  Running mate Gov. Mike Pence said there would be no path to  citizenship, while Gov. Chris Christie said there would be no  legalization at all. Campaign manager Kellyanne Conway dodged  answering the question completely, simply saying he’d be  humane.', '  “The question is what to do,” she said.', '  13. A deportation force is not currently being discussed.', '  “He is not talking about a deportation force,” Conway later  said.', '  14. The plan — whatever the plan is — has never  changed.', '  “Absolutely consistent,” said Pence.', '  “Completely consistent,” said Christie.', '  “Pretty consistent,” said Conway.', '  15. Deport all undocumented immigrants in due time, using a  deportation force.', '  Two more surrogates muddled Trump’s immigration policy just days  later.', '  Son Donald Trump, Jr. told CNN on August 30 that his father hoped  to deport everyone.', '  “That’s been the same, correct. But again, you have to start with  baby steps. You have to let ICE do their job, you have to  eliminate sanctuary cities, you have to get rid of the criminals  certainly first and foremost, you have to secure the border.  These are common sense things, Anderson,” he said.', '  Meanwhile, Trump surrogate Jack Kingston told MSNBC that a  deportation force “is part of it. We are going to learn more  Wednesday.”', '  16. Don’t worry, hardliners. There’s no amnesty and Mexico  will pay!', '  In a speech in Phoenix on September 1 Trump eased base concerns  and re-upped his harsh immigration rhetoric by insisting that he  would create a deportation task force, and there would be no  “amnesty.”', '  Mere hours after meeting with the Mexican president who later  said he’d told Trump that Mexico wouldn’t pay for the wall, Trump  reiterated that he still planned to make Mexico pay for the  wall.', '  17. But “there’s really quite a bit of softening.”', '  Later the day, Trump was pressed by conservative commentator  Laura Ingraham about what had happened to “the softening” of his  policy. He said “there’s softening,” but didn’t indicate what,  exactly, was softening.', '  “Look, we do it in a very humane way, and we’re going to see with  the people that are in the country. Obviously I want to get the  gang members out, the drug peddlers out, I want to get the drug  dealers out. We’ve got a lot of people in this country that you  can’t have, and those people we’ll get out,” Trump said. “And  then we’re going to make a decision at a later date once  everything is stabilized ... I think you’re going to see there’s  really quite a bit of softening.”', '  18. I won’t rule out a path to citizenship.', '  Asked September 6 if he’d rule out a pathway to citizenship for  undocumented immigrants, Trump declined.', '  “I’m not ruling out anything,” Trump said. “We’re going to make  that decision into the future. OK?”', '  19. We’ll pay for the wall, Mexico will pay us back, OK?', '  “The End Illegal Immigration act fully funds the construction of  a wall on our southern border,” Trump said on October 22nd,  outlining the plans for his first 100 days in office. “With the  full understanding that the country of Mexico will be reimbursing  the United States for the full cost of such a wall, OK?”', '  Current position: Trump says he will deport millions, but he has  not ruled out creating a pathway to citizenship. He’ll build a  wall, pay for said wall, but later he’ll get reimbursed by  Mexico.', ' YOUNG UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS AND CHILDREN OF ILLEGAL  IMMIGRANTS', '  1. Dreamers can maybe stay.', '  Trump wavered on what to do with the Dreamers — young  undocumented immigrants who were brought to this country by their  parents as children who are now afforded limited protection from  deportation via the DREAM Act but no path to citizenship.', '  When asked if Dreamers would have to go back, he said, “It  depends.”', '  2. Nope, they can’t stay.', '  By August 2015, that ambiguity was gone: “They have to go,” he  said on “Meet the Press.”', '  3. End birthright citizenship.', '  Trump first proposed ending the 14th Amendment — the  Constitutional provision that grants citizenship to those born in  the country — last August. This is something few in his  party agree on, and it’s even more unclear how it would be  applied: Does it apply to children of mixed status parents, where  one parent is illegal? Or simply those with two undocumented  immigrant parents? Would he revoke the citizenship of the  estimated 4.5 million children born to illegal immigrants already  here?', '  The Trump campaign did not answer questions from reporters at the  time.', '  4. “American children” also deserve dreams.', '  “Where is the sanctuary for American children?” Trump asked  during a late August rally while alluding Dreamers.', '  “The dreamers we never talk about are the young Americans. Why  aren’t young Americans dreamers also? I want my dreamers to be  young Americans,” he said, offering up a rhetorical device in  place of policy.', '  Current position: Deport children benefiting from the DREAM Act,  repeal the 14th Amendment to end birthright citizenship.', ' PROPOSED MUSLIM BAN', '  1. No Muslims should be allowed to enter the United States  —as immigrants or visitors.', '  Donald Trump called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims  entering the United States” in a statement about “preventing  Muslim immigration” in December.', '  2. Ban Muslims from entering but make an exception for friends  and Muslims serving in the US military.', '  He later amended his stance in an interview with Fox News, saying  the 5,000 Muslims serving the United States military would be  exempt from the ban and allowed to return home from overseas  deployments. He also suggested that current Muslim residents  — like his “many Muslim friends” — would be exempt,  too, and able to come and go freely.', '  3. The Muslim ban was just an suggestion.', '  “We have a serious problem, and it’s a temporary ban - it hasn’t  been called for yet, nobody’s done it, this is just a suggestion  until we find out what’s going on,” Trump said on in mid-May,  softening for the first time in months on the ban.', '  4. Ban Muslims as a matter of policy, as well as people from  countries with a history of terrorism.', '  In a national security address after the terror attack in  Orlando, Trump said that if he’s elected he would “suspend  immigration from areas of the world where there’s a proven  history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our  allies until we fully understand how to end these threats.”', '  5. Ban people from countries with a history of terrorism.', '  When a reporter asked Trump how he’d feel about a Muslim Scot  entering the U.S. while on a trip to visit his golf courses in  Scotland, Trump said it “wouldn’t bother me.” He then went on to  emphasize that he did not want “people coming in from the terror  countries.” When asked, Trump would not name one such  country.', '  6. Ban Muslims from countries with a history of terrorism, and  potentially also other Muslims.', '  That same day, when pressed about how his statement in Scotland  jived with Trump’s proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the  country, spokesman Hope Hicks said that the ban would just apply  to Muslims from countries with a history of terrorism. She would  not, however, confirm that Muslims residing in peaceful countries  would be exempt.', '  7. The Muslim ban was never about Muslims.', '  The next week, a top spokesperson said the initial ban was not  about Muslims.', '  “I know the news media has been reporting that the initial ban  was against all Muslims, and that simply was not the case. It’s  simply for Muslim immigration, and Mr. Trump is adding specifics  to clarify what his position is,” Katrina Pierson told CNN,  though advisers at the time said it was indeed about religion  exclusively.', '  8. Nothing has changed, nothing to see here.', '  “This is not accurate,” spokesperson Hope Hicks said when asked  if the policies were changing and removing the word “Muslim.”  “There has been no change from the exchanges over the  weekend.”', '  9. The ban is negotiable.', '  Then-campaign manager Paul Manafort in late May said the Muslim  ban was negotiable, and how Trump initially articulated it was  not what it would turn out in the end. Manafort said the policy  is currently that “where there is terrorist activity — Syria  or Iraq — we will temporarily suspend immigration until we  can establish a vetting system in which we can identify who  people are who are coming in.”', '  The government already has a rigorous, nine-step vetting process  in place for refugees. Trump has previously included all Syrian  refugees, including children and non-Muslims, in the ban.', '  10. The ban would call for “extreme vetting.”', '  Mid July, Trump told “60 Minutes” that people from suspicious  “territories” would receive “a thing called ‘extreme vetting.’”  He did not describe how “extreme vetting” would differ from the  current vetting process.', '  “Call it whatever you want,” Trump told CBS when asked if he was  changing his previously released policy.', '  11. The ban hasn’t changed, I just don’t like saying the word  “Muslim.”', '  On Fox News in late July, Trump told Sean Hannity his position  hadn’t changed from his initial ban on Muslims entering the  country.', '  “I think my position’s gotten bigger, I’m talking about  territories now. People don’t want me to say Muslim—I guess  I’d prefer not saying it, frankly, myself. So we’re talking about  territories.”', '  12. There’s a ban, plus “extreme vetting” that includes an  ideological test.', '  “The time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the  threats we face today,” Trump said in a speech in mid-August that  reiterated his call for “extreme vetting” and reiterated that  he’d temporarily ban immigration from some countries that he  declined to identify.', '  He then proposed an ideological test for immigration.', '  “In addition to screening out all members or sympathizers of  terrorist groups, we must also screen out any who have hostile  attitudes toward our country or its principles ― or who  believe that Sharia law should supplant American law,” he  said.', '  13. There’s no way to really do an ideological test.', '  “We don’t know if they have love or hate in their heart,” Trump  said in September, articulating the problem many onlookers have  expressed about his ban. “There’s no way to tell.”', '  14. Only people who love America are allowed.', '  Later, despite acknowledging the impossibility of the task, Trump  maintained that an ideological test is key to the nation’s  immigration system.', '  “We want to make sure we’re only admitting those into our country  who support our values and love - and I mean love - our people,”  he said.', '  15. The ban has “morphed.”', '  Trump was pressed on whether or not the Muslim ban still exists  during the second presidential debate, and insisted that it was  now only extreme vetting.', '  “The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into  an extreme vetting from certain areas of the world,” Trump said,  without actually saying whether or not the ban on travel still  stands. “It’s called extreme vetting.”', '  Current position: Trump will not say whether or not he intends to  ban people of Muslim faith from the U.S., but he will say that  “extreme vetting” will apply to people from certain countries.  It’s unclear where those countries are, what “extreme vetting”  entails or how he intends to institute an ideological test for  entry.', ' VISAS FOR HIGH-SKILLED WORKERS', '  1. H-1B visas are bad for American workers.', '  Trump’s immigration plan was published on his website in August  2015: it opposed the H-1B program, which allows non-immigrant  visas for specialty occupations, arguing then that it was bad for  American workers.', '  2. H-1B visas are good.', '  At the CNBC debate in October, Trump denied that he’d been  critical about the program. “I am all in favor of keeping these  talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley,”  he said.', '  3. H-1B visas are still bad, according to Trump’s unchanged  website.', '  At the Fox News debate on March 3, some five months later, Fox  News host Megyn Kelly pressed Trump on which of these conflicting  views he supports.', '  4. H-1B visas are necessary: ‘I’m changing.’', '  “I’m changing. I’m changing. We need highly skilled people in  this country. If we can’t do it, we will get them in. And we do  need in Silicon Valley, we absolutely have to have. So we do need  highly skilled,” he said.', '  5. H-1B visas are definitely bad.', '  His campaign later released a statement reversing this shortly  after the March 3 debate ended.', '  “Megyn Kelly asked about highly skilled immigration. The H-1B  program is neither high-skilled nor immigration: These are  temporary foreign workers, imported from abroad, for the explicit  purpose of substituting for American workers at lower pay,” Trump  wrote in a statement. “I will end forever the use of the H-1B as  a cheap labor program and institute an absolute requirement to  hire American workers first for every visa and immigration  program. No exceptions.”', '  He reaffirmed this position in the GOP debate on March 10, one  week later, vowing to end the program that he noted he uses  himself as a businessman.', '  Current position: Back where he started — against the H-1B  visa program.', ' BORDER CONTROL AND THE REFUGEE CRISIS', '  1. The U.S. has a ‘humanitarian’ obligation to take in some  Syrian refugees.', '  Trump initially said the country should absorb Syrian  refugees.', '  “I hate the concept of it, but on a humanitarian basis, you have  to,” Trump told Bill O’Reilly on Fox News on a Tuesday night in  September. “But you know, it’s living in hell in Syria. There’s  no question about it. They’re living in hell, and something has  to be done.”', '  2. The U.S. cannot and should not accept Syrian refugees.', '  The next day, Trump said the country couldn’t welcome refugees  fleeing the Syrian civil war.', '  “Look, from a humanitarian standpoint, I’d love to help. But we  have our own problems,” he said on Fox.', '  During the March debate, Trump defended his changing view.', '  “First time the question had been put to me, it was very early  on. The migration had just started. And I had heard that the  number was a very, very small number. By the second day, two or  three days later, I heard the number was going to be thousands  and thousands of people. You know, when they originally heard  about it, they were talking about bringing very, very small  numbers in, and I said, begrudgingly, well, I guess maybe that’s  OK,” Trump said. “By the time I went back and studied it, and  they were talking about bringing thousands and thousands, I  changed my tune. And I don’t think there’s anything wrong with  that.”', '  3. Close the border.', '  “I’d close up our borders to people until we figure out what is  going on,” Trump said on Fox News the morning of the Brussels  attacks claimed by ISIS that killed at least 28 and injured more  than 270.', '  4. Don’t close the border, just be careful.', '  “I didn’t say shut it down — I said you have to be very  careful, you have to be careful on who’s coming into our  country,” he said the same day as the Fox News interview on CBSN,  reiterating that people from Syria without papers shouldn’t be  allowed in.', '  Current position: Against closing the borders entirely. Against  accepting Syrian refugees in the United States.', ' DEFEATING ISIS', '  1. Maybe send troops in. Definitely go after the oil fields.', '  In Trump’s first interview after announcing his bid, he signaled  that he’d both send in ground troops to Iraq and not send in  ground troops.', '  “You bomb the hell out of them, and then you encircle it, and  then you go in,” he told Bill O’Reilly, who remarked that the  plan necessitated ground forces. “I disagree, I say that you can  defeat ISIS by taking their wealth — their wealth is the  oil.”', '  2. Bomb the oil fields. Send some troops in.', '  On CNN, Trump said, “I would bomb the hell out of those oil  fields. I wouldn’t send many troops because you won’t need them  by the time I’m finished.”', '  3. Send troops to defeat ISIS. Don’t forget about the oil fields.', '  In a single August interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” he  offered three solutions for what to do with the oil field  profits: keep them, give them to veterans and their families, or,  when pressed, perhaps give some to the Iraqi people.', '  Months later, in a March debate, Trump ballparked the number of  troops he would need to send in to defeat ISIS.', '  “We really have no choice, we have to knock out ISIS,” Trump  said. “I would listen to the generals, but I’m hearing numbers of  20,000-30,000.”', '  4. I’ve got this! I know more than the generals.', '  “I know more about ISIS than the generals do,” Trump said in  November in Iowa. “Believe me.”', '  5. Destroy the oil. Let our regional allies send ground troops.  If they don’t, stop buying their oil.', '  In a foreign-policy focused interview with the New York Times  published March 26, Trump said that the U.S. should “take” ISIS’  oil, but then said the U.S. should “knock the hell out of the oil  and do it because it’s a primary source of money for ISIS.” Trump  also ruled out sending in U.S. troops, saying that other  countries in the region — “regional Arab partners” such as  Saudi Arabia — should provide the ground troops. If these  countries did not, the United States would stop buying their oil  and withhold “protection” in the region.', '  6. Declare war, send in some troops.', '  “We’re going to declare war against ISIS. We have to wipe out  ISIS,” Trump said in his first interview with running mate Gov.  Mike Pence. “I am going to have very few troops on the ground.  We’re going to have unbelievable intelligence, which we need;  which, right now, we don’t have. We don’t have the people over  there.”', '  Trump said he’d involve NATO, despite the fact that he has said  the U.S. should withdraw from NATO, and the surrounding states,  as well. He added that Hillary Clinton created ISIS. (PolitiFact  deemed this statement to be false.)', '  7. I’m going to ask the generals.', '  Months after saying he knew more than the generals, Trump said in  early September that he’d ask them to map out a plan for  defeating ISIS.', '  “Immediately after taking office, I will ask my generals to  present to me a plan within 30 days to defeat and destroy ISIS,”  he said. “This will require military warfare, but also cyber  warfare, financial warfare, and ideological warfare.”', '  8. He’s got a plan, and he’ll tell you if asked.', '  “I’ve heard it,” Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said on  MSNBC. “He’ll tell you if that question is asked. He’ll be happy  to offer specifics without telling the enemy exactly what we’re  going to do.”', '  9. Do more with computers.', '  Trump cited his 10-year-old’s proficiency with computers to argue  that the U.S. needed to better fight ISIS using the  internet.', '  “When you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they’re  beating us at our own game, ISIS,” Trump said. “So we have to get  very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is — it is a  huge problem. I have a son. He’s 10 years old. He has computers.  He is so good with these computers, it’s unbelievable. The  security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it’s  hardly doable.”', '  Current position: It’s still unclear what Trump’s plan to defeat  ISIS is, but it will involve computers and it will be  tough.', ' GUNS', '  1. Get rid of gun-free zones', '  In a speech at the National Rifle Association convention on May  20, where Trump was endorsed by the country’s most powerful gun  group, Trump promised again to do away with gun-free zones, which  include schools and military bases. At a campaign stop in  Vermont, he had previously vowed to get rid of gun-free zones on  his “first day.”', '  2. No guns in classrooms, except maybe some guns in  classrooms.', '  In an interview on May 22, Trump advocated against, and then for,  and then against, and then for guns in classrooms.', '  “I don’t want to have guns in classrooms, although in some cases,  teachers should have guns in classrooms, frankly,” Trump said,  offering up two distinct views in an interview days after he was  endorsed the NRA. “Because teachers, you know — things that  are going on in our schools are unbelievable.”', '  3. I’m not advocating for guns in classrooms, but wait, yes I  am.', '  Trump walked back his view that teachers should have guns a  second later, then reiterated that some teachers should have  guns.', '  “I’m not advocating guns in classrooms,” he continued. “But  remember, in some cases … trained teachers should be able to  have guns in classrooms.”', '  4. Let’s put trained gunmen in schools.', '  Forty-eight hours later, Trump sought to clarify his muddled  remarks, saying he wanted “school resource officers” to have guns  in schools while slamming rival Hillary Clinton’s criticism of  his stance.', '  “The way she said it meant like every student should be sitting  there carrying guns,” Trump said on CNN on May 24. “If trained  people had guns, you wouldn’t have the carnage that you’ve  had.”', '  5. We should only get rid of some gun-free zones.', '  While he decried gun-free zones as “offering up candy to bad  people,” he backed away from axing all of them, telling CNN in  the May 24 interview that they would only be eliminated “in some  cases.”', '  6. More guns would save lives.', '  Trump has repeatedly said that he wished there were other armed  individuals present during terror attacks to fight back.', '  “I think it would’ve been a lot better if they had guns in that  room, somebody could protect,” Trump said after the San  Bernardino shooting in December. “They could’ve protected  themselves if they had guns.”', '  In the wake of the deadly shooting in Orlando, Florida at a gay  nightclub in June, Trump reiterated this view.', '  “It’s too bad that some of the young people that were killed over  the weekend didn’t have guns, you know, attached to their hips,  frankly, and you know where bullets could have flown in the  opposite direction,” he said on the “Howie Carr Show” on June 13,  one day after the attack. “They had a security guard. Other than  that there were no guns in the room. Had people been able to fire  back, it would have been a much different outcome.”', '  At a rally in Atlanta on June 15, Trump declared that the outcome  would have been different if “some of those great people that  were in that club that night had guns strapped to their waist or  strapped to their ankle.”', '  7. I didn’t actually mean arming clubgoers.', '  After he spent a week advocating for arming more of the victims  (who were predominantly clubgoers, in addition to several club  employees), Trump tweeted on June 20 that he didn’t mean he  wanted to arm clubgoers. Trump changed his stance just hours  after the National Rifle Association pushed back against the idea  of allowing people to bring weapons into nightclubs.', '  “I was obviously talking about additional guards or employees,”  Trump tweeted.', '  Current position: More guns are better, though the details are  murky and evolving on how many gun-free zones would be  abolished.', ' ‘FIRST USE’ AND NUCLEAR ARMS', '  1. I wouldn’t strike first.', '  Asked during the first presidential debate about whether he’d  support ’first use,” an un-official U.S. prohibition on the use  of nuclear weapons against enemies who don’t have nuclear  capability, Trump said he wouldn’t strike first against rivals --  a completely different issue.', '  “I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it,” he said  of nuclear weapons. “But I would certainly not do first  strike.”', '  2. Or maybe I would.', '  Shortly after saying he wouldn’t do the first strike, Trump then  reversed himself.', '  “At the same time, we have to be prepared. I can’t take anything  off the table. Because you look at some of these countries, you  look at North Korea, we’re doing nothing there,” he said.', '  Current Position: It’s unclear where Trump stands on “first use,”  or if he’d be willing to strike first.', ' MINIMUM WAGE', '  1. Against raising the minimum wage. Jobs would move to China.', '  During the thick of the primaries, Trump repeatedly argued that  raising the minimum would move jobs to countries like China.  Speaking in the cold language of a businessman looking at his  bottom line, Trump even seemed to indicate overall American  wages, regardless of the law, were too generous already.', '  “Taxes too high, wages too high, we’re not going to be able to  compete against the world,” Trump said in a November debate  hosted by Fox Business. Trump clarified afterwards that he did  not believe American wages were too high, but he did make crystal  clear he was fundamentally opposed to a minimum wage  increase.', '  2. Wages should be raised through economic growth.', '  Trump in an interview with CNBC in May said he would prefer to  try to raise wages through economic growth. His abrupt move  toward a possible increase that he opposed in tough terms is a  significant general election shift.', '  3. Raise the minimum wage.', '  “I am looking at it, and I haven’t decided in terms of numbers.  But I think people have to get more,” Trump said on ABC on May 8,  acknowledging that his statement was a shift when pressed.', '  “Sure, it’s a change. I’m allowed to change,” he said. “But my  real minimum wage is going to be — I’m going to bring  companies back into this country, and they’re going to make a lot  more than the $15 even.”', '  4. Get rid of the federal minimum wage, leave it to the  states.', '  On NBC on the same day, Trump said more specifically that he  wanted states to mandate wages.', '  “Let me just tell you, I’ve been traveling the country for many  months. Since June 16, I’m all over,” he said. “I have seen  what’s going on. And I don’t know how people make it on $7.25 an  hour. Now, with that being said, I would like to see an increase  of some magnitude. But I’d rather leave it to the states. Let the  states decide. Because don’t forget, the states have to compete  with each other.”', '  5. I want to increase it!', '  In a May 11 tweet criticizing Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth  Warren, Trump argued that he was “asking for increase” of the  federal minimum wage.', '  6. States should change it, but it will hurt them.', '  “I actually think that the states should make the decision,”  Trump said in an interview with a Seattle radio station, but  argued that “In some cases, states are going to become  noncompetitive, and they’re going to start losing maybe jobs and  losing business, and they’re going to have to readjust.  Otherwise, they’re just not going to have anything.”', '  7. Let’s make it $10 dollars an hour.', '  As the Washington Post notes, Trump’s shift here are lengthy and  significant: He says he would support raising it to $10 an hour,  argues he never wanted to abolish the federal minimum wage, which  he did.', '  8. It should go up, but states should call the shots here.', '  In a June news conference, Trump said “the minimum wage has to go  up. People are — at least $10, but it has to go up. But I  think that states — federal — I think that states  should really call the shot.”', '  Current position: Raise it to $10 an hour, ignore what I said  before.', ' TAXES', '  1. The wealthy should pay more.', '  “I would take carried interest out, and I would let people making  hundreds of millions of dollars a year pay some tax, because  right now they are paying very little tax and I think it’s  outrageous,” Trump told Bloomberg last August, noting that he’d  be OK paying more taxes. “I want to lower taxes for the middle  class.”', '  2. Cut taxes for the wealthy big time.', '  In September, Trump released a plan that silenced anti-tax  critics with a proposal that slashed taxes for the wealthy by  making the top marginal tax rate 25 percent. He radically  simplified the tax plan by proposing just three brackets, 10  percent, 20 percent, and 25 percent. A whopping 67 percent of the  overall cost of his individual tax cuts would go to the top 20  percent of earners, while 35 percent of it would go to the top 1  percent, according to the Tax Policy Center’s analysis.', '  His plan is estimated to cut $10 trillion in tax revenue, which  would be added to the national debt and deficit over a decade  (more on Trump’s flip-flopping position on paying off the  national debt below). It’s unclear how Trump would pay for such  drastic cuts, but Trump insisted he could do it by offering the  vague promise of striking better deals and cutting government  waste.', '  3. People like me should pay more.', '  Trump was asked again in April during a “TODAY” town hall if he  believed in raising taxes on the wealthy. Despite the big tax  cuts for the wealthy outlined in his own tax plan, he said:', '  “I do, I do, including myself. I do.”', '  In a series of interviews in early May, he claimed that his tax  proposal was a starting point for negotiations and the taxes on  the rich would go up.', '  On Sunday, May 8, Trump told ABC that taxes on the wealthy would  “go up a little bit” in negotiations and that, as a wealthy  person himself, he is personally OK with higher taxes. “I am  willing to pay more. And you know what? Wealthy are willing to  pay more. We’ve had a very good run,” he said.', '  He told NBC’s Chuck Todd something similar: It’s all  negotiable.', '  “Under my proposal, it’s the biggest tax cut by far, of any  candidate by far. But I’m not under the illusion that that’s  going to pass. They’re going to come to me. They’re going to want  to raise it for the rich. Frankly, they’re going to want to raise  it for the rich more than anybody else,” Trump said. “But the  middle class has to be protected. The rich is probably going to  end up paying more. And business might have to pay a little bit  more. But we’re giving a massive business tax cut.”', '  Pressed on that last, confusing point - that business might pay  more but also get a tax cut - Trump said he meant more than his  existing proposal: “Excuse me. I said they might have to pay a  little bit more than my proposal.”', '  He didn’t offer such a qualification for the wealthy until the  next day.', '  4. I never said that. Cut everyone’s taxes!', '  On Monday, May 9, he went on CNN to refute what he’d said the day  before.', '  “I said that I may have to increase on the wealthy — I’m not  going to allow it to be increased on the middle class — now,  if I increase it on the wealthy, that means they’re still going  to be paying less than they’re paying now. I’m not increasing it  from this point, I’m talking about increasing from my tax  proposal,” Trump told CNN, insisting that overall there would be  a tax decrease for the rich and middle class alike.', '  5. Maybe don’t slash taxes by $10 trillion — slash taxes by  $3 trillion, instead.', '  Trump senior economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Wednesday at an  RNC event that the tax plan had been revised to only slash taxes  by $3 trillion — a third of what was initially proposed  — and lower the top individual tax rate to between 30-33  percent, up from the 25 percent initially proposed but below the  current top tax rate of 39.6 percent. The campaign did not  confirm this.', '  6. Scrap the earlier plan entirely. Here are new tax  brackets.', '  Trump took his earlier tax plan offline before a major economic  policy address in early August, where he hiked his initially  proposed tax brackets from 10 percent, 20 percent and 25 percent  to 12 percent, 25 percent and 33 percent. These brackets more  closely mimic his party’s past views on taxes.', '  7. Maybe ditch, maybe keep a $1 trillion tax cut for small  businesses (depending on who is asking).', 'Trump publicly backed away from a trillion-dollar tax cut aimed  at small businesses in order to optimistically claim that his tax  plan won’t add to the debt. But his campaign privately told a  leading small business group he’d keep it.', 'His campaign then reiterated to the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan  group that analyzes tax plans, that he’d definitely get rid of  it, according to a report by the New York Times on what they  called a “trillion-dollar lie.”', 'Current position: Despite Trump’s frequent talk about helping  working people, his tax plan so far seems to mostly benefit the  wealthy. It’s unclear whether or not his plan will include that  small business tax cut.', '  CLIMATE CHANGE', '  1. I don’t believe in it.', '“I don’t believe in climate change,” he told CNN in September  after a long history of calling it both a hoax and a Chinese  invention to undermine U.S. business interests. In May 2016, he  vowed to “renegotiate … at a minimum” the Paris climate  agreement, one of the Obama administration’s landmark  achievements.', '2. Global warming is threatening one of my golf courses.', 'A statement of environmental impact filed by the Trump  International Golf Links & Hotel Ireland, owned by Trump,  cited rising sea levels and extreme weather due to global warming  as the reason the company needed to build a seawall to protect  its coastal resort, Politico reported Monday. The sea wall is  necessary protect the course from “global warming and its  effects.”', '3. I never said climate change was a hoax.', 'During the first presidential debate in late September, Trump  denied ever saying climate change was a hoax perpetuated by the  Chinese (though you can still read his tweet on the matter here.)', '4. Trump believes in climate change, but not that it’s man-made.', 'Trump’s campaign manager offered a more common Republican theory  to explain Trump’s views: Climate change is real, but it’s  “naturally occurring.”', 'Current position: Global warming is real, but it’s not man-made.', '  NATIONAL DEBT', '  1. Get rid of the national debt in 8 years.', 'On March 31, Trump told the Washington Post that the country  needed to eliminate the national debt and that he could do it  “fairly quickly” without raising taxes.', '“I would say over a period of eight years,” he said, arguing he  could do it simply by renegotiating the country’s trade deals.  “I’m renegotiating all of our deals, Bob. The big trade deals  that we’re doing so badly on. With China, $505 billion this year  in trade. We’re losing with everybody.”', '2. Only pay down a little. Invest in infrastructure first.', 'Three weeks later, he told Fortune “you could pay off a  percentage of it” in a decade but he wouldn’t advise being too  aggressive because the country’s infrastructure needs to be  rebuilt and it’s a good time to borrow.', '“It depends on how aggressive you want to be. I’d rather not be  so aggressive,” he said. “Don’t forget: We have to rebuild the  infrastructure of our country. We have to rebuild our military,  which is being decimated by bad decisions. We have to do a lot of  things. We have to reduce our debt, and the best thing we have  going now is that interest rates are so low that lots of good  things can be done that aren’t being done, amazingly.”', 'It’s an argument progressive liberal economists like Paul Krugman  could have (and actually have) made. Not only is it far from his  original position, it’s far from his party’s view on the issue.', '3. Pay off the debt by getting America’s creditors to accept  less.', 'Despite the U.S. economy being fundamentally grounded in its  ability to borrow at very low interest rates, Trump told CNBC  that he would negotiate with creditors to get them to accept less  than the full amount owed.', '“I would borrow, knowing that if the economy crashed, you could  make a deal,” Trump said.', 'Experts say this idea is pure fantasy, no matter how good Trump’s  deal-making skills are. In addition to imperiling the economy,  the proposal could also be unconstitutional.', '4. Don’t worry about it — the U.S. can’t default because we  “print the money.”', 'A week after suggesting that he could get U.S. creditors to  accept less than the full amount, Trump defended his stance on  CNN by calling himself “the king of debt” and railing against  publications that reported his earlier proposal.', '“People said I want to go and buy debt and default on debt, and I  mean, these people are crazy. This is the United States  government,” he said on CNN on May 9.” “First of all, you never  have to default because you print the money, I hate to tell you,  OK?”', 'He then advocated for buying back some of the government’s debt  at a discount, using interest rates to save the country money.  It’s a strategy that works may work for businesses but would be  more difficult, if not impossible for the U.S. government,  economists told the Washington Post.', '“I understand debt better than probably anybody. I know how to  deal with debt very well. I love debt — but you know, debt  is tricky and it’s dangerous, and you have to be careful and you  have to know what you’re doing,” Trump said.', '5. I won’t try to renegotiate the national debt.', '“We have to start chopping that debt down,” Trump told CBS in  June. “I wouldn’t renegotiate the debt. I’d negotiate, if I do a  deal in a corporation, as an example, and if the economy goes  bad, I’ll oftentimes renegotiate that debt. But that’s a  different thing. That’s just a corporate thing. And other people  like me, very big people in the world of business, they do that.”', '6. Take out new loans and pay back debt with new debt.', '“I think it could be a good time to borrow and pay off debt,  borrow debt, make longer-term debt,” he said in the same June CBS  interview.', '7. My plans are deficit neutral.', '“It will be deficit neutral,” Trump said of his economic plan  released in September. “It will be accomplished through a  complete overhaul of our tax, regulatory, energy and trade  policies.”', '8. Maybe borrow $10 trillion.', 'One of Trump’s advisers echoed the skepticism many had of Trump’s  plans: that they would cost a lot more than Trump’s tax plan  would bring in.', 'Tom Barrack, an adviser, said Trump’s policies would increase the  national debt by $10 trillion — money the nation would have  to borrow to accomplish Trump’s plans.', 'Current position: Either “chop” the national debt using an  approach that is still unclear, or add $10 trillion to the debt  to accomplish plans.', '  ABORTION', '  1. Criminalize women who have abortions.', 'Though Trump said in 1999 that he was “very pro-choice,” Trump  has consistently claimed that he’s against abortion, except for  in cases of rape, incest, or to save the mother’s life, since  starting his bid last June.', 'But during an exclusive interview with MSNBC’s Chris Matthews  just after 1 p.m., Trump struggled to define his views on  abortion aside from describing himself as “pro-life.” When  continually pressed for how he’d handle women who violated a  theoretical ban on abortion, Trump said the “answer is that there  has to be some form of punishment, yeah.”', '2. Let the states decide what to do about criminalizing abortion.', 'At 3:36 p.m., Trump put out a statement saying the issue is  “unclear and should be put back into the states for  determination.”', '3. Never mind. Don’t punish the women.', 'He fully walked back his position that women should be punished  for violating a theoretical abortion ban 80 minutes later,  releasing a statement saying “the doctor or any other person  performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally  responsible, not the woman. The woman is a victim in this case as  is the life in her womb.”', '4. Probably overturn Roe v. Wade, then let states handle it.', 'Pressed three times in the final presidential debate on whether  he hoped his anti-abortion Supreme Court nominees should overturn  Roe v. Wade, Trump said “that will happen automatically in my  opinion. Because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.”', 'He went on to say that after it’s overturned states should handle  it: “I will say this. It will go back to the states and the  states will then make a determination.”', 'Current position: Overturn Roe v. Wade, then let states decide  it.', ' WHETHER PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS BORN IN AMERICA', '  1. I don’t know.', '  “I really don’t know. I mean, I don’t know why he wouldn’t  release his records. But you know, honestly, I don’t want to get  into it,” Trump said in July 2015, asked about his inaccurate,  years-long insistence that the president wasn’t born in the  United States. (President Obama had released his long form birth  certificate in 2011.)', '  2. I don’t want to answer the question.', '  “I don’t talk about that anymore,” Trump said on MSNBC in  December 2015 in response to a question about whether or not he  believed President Obama was born in the United States.', '  3. I’ll explain my theory one day.', '  “Who knows [if Obama is a natural-born citizen]? Who knows? Who  cares right now? We’re talking about something else, OK? I’m  going to have my own theory on Obama. Someday I’ll write a book,  I’ll do another book that will do successfully,” Trump said in  January 2016.', '  4. I’ll only answer that question at the “right time.”', '  “I’ll answer that question at the right time,” Trump said  mid-September 2016. “I just don’t want to answer it yet.”', '  5. The president was born in the United States. “Period.”', '  “President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period,”  Trump said after a lengthy press conference touting his new hotel  and veteran support.', '  6. She started it, I finished it by getting the birth  certificate.', 'In his dismissal of the conspiracy theory he’d championed, Trump  inaccurately claimed that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton  started the conspiracy theory.', '7. I only said it to “get on” with the campaign.', 'Asked what changed to prompt his reversal after nurturing a  conspiracy theory for five years, Trump said he acknowledged the  president’s birthplace to “get on with — I wanted to get on  with the campaign.”', '8. I didn’t say Obama was American because no one was asking.', 'Pressed in the first debate on September 26 on why Trump didn’t  lay the birther conspiracy to rest in the five years after Obama  released his long-form birth certificate, Trump falsely claimed  he didn’t publicly affirm his belief that Obama is an American  citizen because he wasn’t asked.', '“Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it,”  Trump said. “I figured you’d ask the question tonight, of course.  But nobody was caring much about it”', '9. Clinton should apologize, not me.', 'Trump inaccurately insisted, again, that Clinton’s campaign  started the rumor, and said she should apologize to the president  for it.', 'Current position: Trump said he believes Obama was born in the  United States because it is better for his campaign, but he  continues to inaccurately argue Clinton started the birther  movement — and that she should apologize for it.', '  VOTING FOR THE IRAQ WAR', '  1. Clinton voted for the war, so she has bad judgment.', 'Trump slammed Clinton in late June for her vote authorizing the  invasion of Iraq.', '“It all started with her bad judgment in supporting the War in  Iraq in the first place. Though I was not in government service,  I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes,  even before the war ever started,” he falsely stated in his June  22 speech. (There is no evidence he opposed the invasion, but  there is ample evidence that he supported it.)', '2. It doesn’t matter, people make mistakes.', 'Pressed on his running mate Pence’s vote for the Iraq war in an  interview on 60 Minutes, Trump said in July he didn’t “care”  because “it’s a long time ago, and he voted that way and they  were also misled.”', '“He’s entitled to make a mistake every once in a while,” Trump  declared, telling CBS’ Lesley Stahl of Clinton that “no, she’s  not” allowed to make a mistake herself.', 'Current position: It’s OK that Trump’s running mate voted for the  Iraq war, but it’s not OK that Clinton did.', '  2011 INTERVENTION IN LIBYA', '  1. The intervention in Libya by the U.S.-led coalition was a  terrible idea.', 'Asked in October 2015 if he felt the Middle East would be more  stable with Libyan dictator Muammar Gadhafi and Iraq’s  authoritarian leader Saddam Hussein still in power, Trump told  NBC News’ Chuck Todd, “Of course it would be. You wouldn’t have  had your Benghazi situation, which is one thing which was just a  terrible situation…But of course, it would. Libya is —  is not even — nobody even knows what’s goin’ on over there.  It’s not even a country anymore.”', 'A few weeks later, he was pressed again on CNN to say whether he  felt the two leaders of brutal regimes should have been left in  power.', '“100 percent,” Trump said. “I mean, look at Libya. Look at Iraq.  Iraq used to be no terrorists. [Hussein] would kill the  terrorists immediately, which is like now it’s the Harvard of  terrorism.”', 'He continued: “If you look at Iraq from years ago, I’m not saying  he was a nice guy, he was a horrible guy, but it was a lot better  than it is right now. Right now, Iraq is a training ground for  terrorists. Right now, Libya, nobody even knows Libya —  frankly, there is no Iraq and there is no Libya. It’s all broken  up. They have no control. Nobody knows what’s going on.”', '2. I’ve never offered a different opinion on Libya.', 'When then-rival Sen. Ted Cruz brought up Trump’s 2011 support for  the intervention, which Trump offered at the time via a video  blog, during a February debate, Trump denied having ever  supported Gadhafi’s ouster.', '“He said I was in favor in Libya,” he said. “I never discussed  that subject. I was in favor of Libya? We would be so much better  off if Gadhafi would be in charge right now.”', '3. I guess I did support an intervention.', 'When CBS actually played the video of Trump discussing the  subject — and supporting an intervention — in front of  Trump in early June 2016, Trump changed his mind and acknowledged  the past video.', '“That’s a big difference from what we’re talking about,” Trump  said. “I was for something, but I wasn’t for what we have right  now.”', '4. I wanted a surgical intervention, not a “strong” intervention.', 'When pressed during the CBS interview, Trump said he was for  “surgical” intervention, not a “strong intervention.”', '“I didn’t mind surgical. And I said surgical. You do a surgical  shot, and you take him out. But I wasn’t for what happened. Look  at the way - I mean, look at with Benghazi and with all of the  problems that we’ve had. It was handled horribly,” he said.', '“I think since then you’ve said you were never for intervention,  so it’s confusing,” CBS’s John Dickerson countered.', '“I was never for strong intervention. I could have seen surgical  where you take out Gadhafi and his group,” Trump responded.', '5. We really should have taken the oil in Libya, too, since we  were there.', 'In the first debate, Trump inaccurately claimed ISIS now controls  huge oil stores in Libya (they don’t) and that the U.S. should  have taken the oil after the intervention. (That would have  violated the Geneva Conventions.)', 'Current position: As Trump put it, “I was for something, but I  wasn’t for what we have right now.” That “something” seems to  include violating the Geneva Conventions to seize Libyan oil.', '  JAPAN AND NUKES', '  1. Japan should have nuclear weapons.', 'In March, Trump said the U.S. should reconsider its policy of not  allowing Japan to have nuclear weapons. He reiterated that view  in April.', '“It’s not like, gee whiz, nobody has them. So, North Korea has  nukes. Japan has a problem with that. I mean, they have a big  problem with that. Maybe they would in fact be better off if they  defend themselves from North Korea,” Trump said on Fox News in  April.', 'Host Chris Wallace followed up, asking, “With nukes?”', '“Including with nukes, yes, including with nukes,” Trump said.', '2. I never said that!', 'But at a Sacramento rally in June, Trump accused Clinton of lying  when she repeated his view as an example of his unfitness when it  comes to matters of national security.', 'Clinton “made a speech, she’s making another one tomorrow, and  they sent me a copy of the speech. And it was such lies about my  foreign policy, that they said I want Japan to get nuclear  weapons. Give me a break,” Trump said. “See they don’t say it: I  want Japan and Germany and Saudi Arabia and South Korea and many  of the NATO states, nations, they owe us tremendously, we’re  taking care of all those people and what I want them to do is pay  up.”', 'Current position: It’s unclear whether Trump would reverse U.S.  policy to allow Japan to have nuclear weapons, but it’s clear  Trump doesn’t like being reminded of the previous positions he  took.', '  MONEY IN POLITICS', '  1. Accepting donations means a candidate is controlled by special  interests.', 'Trump announced that he’d self-fund his campaign when he  announced his presidential bid. This, he said, time and time  again would help him better serve the country against the  corrupting force of money in politics.', '“By self-funding my campaign, I am not controlled by my donors,  special interests or lobbyists. I am only working for the people  of the U.S.!” he wrote in a September 5 Facebook post.', '2. People can donate to me as long as they don’t want anything in  return.', 'Despite the self-funding promise, the Trump campaign quietly sent  out fundraising emails, put a glossy donate option on its website  and raked in millions. Still, Trump insists, it’s about  investment in the campaign — not the cash itself.', '“I actually like the idea of investing in a campaign, but it has  to be no strings attached,” he said in a CBS interview.', '3. The Trump campaign will not fully self-fund.', 'Trump has said he won’t self-fund like he did in the primary.', '“I’ll be putting up money, but won’t be completely self-funding,”  he told the Wall Street Journal in a May 4 interview, noting that  he’s created a finance committee and will tap his base for money  going into the general election. He’s hired Steven Mnuchin, a  former Goldman Sachs partner who has a history of political  donations across both sides of the aisle, to head up the  committee.', 'This is a reversal, but only in rhetorical terms, since Trump  isn’t exactly self-funding his primary campaign, despite his loud  protestations to the contrary. PolitiFact dubs his claim “half  true” because Trump is pulling in big bucks from donors and most  of his own contributions are technically loans or in-kind  contributions, signaling that he may want to recoup those costs  eventually.', 'Current position: Political donations are fine when those  donations benefit the Trump campaign.', '  VIOLATING U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL LAWS WITH REGARD TO TORTURE,  TERRORISM', '  1. The military will obey potentially illegal orders.', 'In December, Trump started demanding that the US target the  families of ISIS members in addition to “bombing the sh*t” out of  the terrorist organization. He went further in February,  advocating for torture as a method of interrogation.', '“I would bring back waterboarding, and I’d bring back a hell of a  lot worse than waterboarding,” Trump declared in the February  debate just ahead of the New Hampshire primary. Calls for  bringing torture back became a regular applause line at rallies,  despite the likelihood that both of these ideas would require the  American military to obey orders that violate international laws  and federal anti-torture statutes.', 'Pressed at a debate on March 3 over whether the American military  would obey his order to violate international laws and the Geneva  Convention to do such things, Trump insisted they’d listen to  him, despite condemnation from military leaders and  conservatives.', '“Frankly, when I say they’ll do as I tell them, they’ll do as I  tell them,” he said.', '2. The military shouldn’t break the law, after all.', 'He then reversed this position the very next day, on March 4, in  a statement to the Wall Street Journal, saying he “will not order  military or other officials to violate those laws and will seek  their advice on such matters.”', '3. The laws forbidding torture should be changed so no one has to  break them.', 'Not long after terrorist attacks in Brussels killed at least 28  people and injured dozens more on March 22, Trump called in to  CNN to expand on his call to legalize waterboarding.', '“Look, I think we have to change our law on the waterboarding  thing, where they can chop off heads and drown people in cages,  in heavy steel cages and we can’t water board,” Trump told CNN’s  Wolf Blitzer. “We have to change our laws and we have to be able  to fight at least on almost equal basis.”', 'When Blitzer reminded Trump that military leaders don’t support  torture and that it violates international agreements that the  United States has signed, Trump called opposition to torture a  “political decision.”', '“I would say that the eggheads that came up with this  international law should turn on their television and watch CNN  right now, because I’m looking at scenes on CNN right now as I’m  speaking to you that are absolutely atrocious,” Trump said. “And  I would be willing to bet, when I am seeing all of the bodies  laying all over the floor, including young, beautiful children  laying dead on the floor, I would say if they watched that,  maybe, just maybe they’ll approve of waterboarding and other  things.”', 'Current position: Trump says he’s against violating international  laws or ordering others to do so, but wants to change the laws to  legalize, at minimum, waterboarding.', ' KU KLUX KLAN AND DAVID DUKE', '  1. ‘I disavow, OK?’', '  After former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard and white nationalist  David Duke began encouraging his followers to vote for the  Republican front-runner, including making a plea on his radio  show on February 25, Trump initially disavowed Duke’s support in  a press conference on February 26.', '  “I didn’t even know he endorsed me. David Duke endorsed me? OK,  all right. I disavow, OK?” Trump said.', '  2. ‘I don’t know anything about David Duke. OK?’', '  After disavowing David Duke on a Friday, Trump was asked about  the Ku Klux Klan and Duke by CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday. Trump  claimed to know nothing of Duke or the KKK.', '  “I don’t know anything about David Duke. OK? I don’t know  anything about what you’re even talking about with white  supremacy or white supremacists. So I don’t know. I don’t know,  did he endorse me or what’s going on, because, you know, I know  nothing about David Duke. I know nothing about white  supremacists. And so you’re asking me a question that I’m  supposed to be talking about people that I know nothing about,”  Trump said, refusing three times to unequivocally condemn the  support of white supremacists until he knew more about  them.', '  3. ‘I disavow, OK?’ — part two.', '  After that cagey song and dance-like interview sparked outrage,  Trump took to Twitter to clarify, tweeting a video of his Friday  press conference in which he did disavow Duke.', '  The next day on NBC’s “Today,” Trump blamed his refusal to  condemn Duke and the KKK on a lousy earpiece but continued to  hedge against disavowing the support of “groups” he doesn’t know  anything about, despite Savannah Guthrie’s reminder that in the  interview in question, Trump had been only been asked about the  KKK and Duke.', 'Current position: Trump has disavowed Duke, despite a lengthy  back-and-forth about whether he knows about him or not.', '  THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL', '  1. Keep the current deal with Iran, police it.', 'Trump was one of the few Republicans who didn’t immediately  promise to rip up the Iranian nuclear deal. The author of “The  Art of the Deal” told his supporters that while it was the worst  deal ever, they’d probably have to live with it.', '“It’s very hard to say, “We’re ripping it up.′ And the problem is  by the time I got in there, they will have already received the  $150 billion,” Trump said, referring to a high estimate of how  many of Iran’s assets will be unfrozen as part of the deal (the  White House says after Iran’s debts are paid, it’s closer to $56  billion).', '“But I will police that deal,” he said, touting his handling of  business contracts. “I would police that contract so tough that  they don’t have a chance. As bad as the contract is, I will be so  tough on that contract.”', '2. Renegotiate the nuclear deal with Iran.', 'In September, he went further.', '“When I am elected president, I will renegotiate with Iran —  right after I enable the immediate release of our American  prisoners and ask Congress to impose new sanctions that stop Iran  from having the ability to sponsor terrorism around the world,”  he wrote in an op-od for USA Today.', 'Current position: Renegotiate the deal.', '  HEALTH CARE', '  1. Repeal Obamacare. Look to Canada for inspiration.', 'In August, Trump was asked repeatedly if he still supported the  single-payer health care he’d touted in the past. He said America  should have a private system but repeatedly praised Canada and  Scotland’s socialized system.', '“As far as single-payer, it works in Canada. It works incredibly  well in Scotland. It could have worked in a different age, which  is the age you’re talking about here,” Trump said. “What I’d like  to see is a private system without the artificial lines around  every state … Get rid of the artificial lines, and you will  have yourself great plans. And then we have to take care of the  people that can’t take care of themselves. And I will do that  through a different system.”', '2. Repeal Obamacare. Cover everybody.', '“I am going to take care of everybody,” Trump told CBS in  September. “I don’t care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody’s  going to be taken care of much better than they’re taken care of  now.”', '3. Repeal Obamacare, but ‘I like the mandate’', 'During a CNN town hall on February 18, Trump started to answer a  question about how he’d replace the Affordable Care Act with  health savings accounts, “which are great,” but interrupted  himself to talk at length about how he’s “a self-funder.” When  pressed by interviewer Anderson Cooper about what would happen  when Obamacare is repealed and the mandate disappeared, therefore  allowing insurance companies to deny coverage to those with  pre-existing conditions, Trump said:', '“Well, I like the mandate. OK. So here’s where I’m a little bit  different. I don’t want people dying on the streets and I say  this all the time.”', '4. Repeal Obamacare. Replace it with something.', 'Trump was mocked in the February 25 debate for being vague about  how he would replace Obamacare.', '“You’ll have many different plans. You’ll have competition,  you’ll have so many different plans,” he said at the debate,  earning derision from Sen. Marco Rubio.', '5. Repeal Obamacare. Not everyone will be covered.', 'His health care plan, finally released online in March, has far  more in common with the kind of boilerplate health care proposals  the rest of the Republican party touts than his earlier praise  for Canada suggested it might.', 'It would likely cause 21 million people to lose their health  insurance and cost about $270 billion over 10 years, according to  the nonpartisan budget advocacy group Committee for a Responsible  Federal Budget (CRFB).', 'It offers up unspecified amounts of grants to states to replace  Medicaid, but it’s not clear how or what those would look like,  or how they would cover the millions of people that Trump’s plan  lets fall through the cracks. CRFB noted that block grants “could  generate a wide range of savings” to the federal budget, but  without details on them, it is “impossible to score any savings”  from his plan.', 'Current position: Repeal Obamacare.

Be careful though, it’s still rigged.', '“Nov. 8, we’d better be careful, because that election is going  to be rigged,” he said August 1st in Ohio in a claim PolitiFact  rated ‘pants on fire’ wrong. “People are going to walk in and  they’re going to vote 10 times, maybe, who knows?”', '3. It’s rigged by the media.', 'With polls showing Trump trailing Clinton consistently, he  challenged the legitimacy of the election and the polls he once  championed.', '“The election is being rigged by corrupt media pushing completely  false allegations and outright lies in an effort to elect her  president,” Trump said October 15th.', '4. It’s rigged by voter fraud and the media!', '“The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and  distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary - but also at many  polling places - SAD,” he tweeted.', '5. Everything’s rigged!', '“When the people who control the political power in our society  can rig investigations like her investigation was rigged, can rig  polls, you see these phony polls, and rig the media, they can  wield absolute power over your life, your economy, and your  country, and benefit big time by it. They control what you hear  and what you don’t hear. What is covered, how it’s covered, even  if it’s covered at all,” Trump said at a Florida rally on October  24th.', '6. It might not be rigged', 'Once the FBI announced that they’d review additional emails  related to Clinton’s time as Secretary of State that were  obtained in a separate investigation, Trump told a crowd that  maybe the system wasn’t so rigged after all.', '“But with what I’ve just announced,” Trump said in New Hampshire.  “It might not be as rigged as I thought, right?

It’s definitely rigged.', 'After the FBI announced that the additional emails had not  changed their decision not to recommend charges against Clinton,  Trump returned to arguing that the system was rigged in her  favor.', '“No, you have to understand.

This  includes not only drugs, but also food, energy and consumer  packaged goods.', '  But at the end of the day, Cramer thinks the story behind this  stock is all about trust. The bulls believe in Intrexon and its  CEO, billionaire healthcare investor Randall Kirk. The bears see  Intrexon as a cult of personality stock built around Kirk.', '  Given the long track record Kirk has for taking over drug  companies and selling them for big bucks, Cramer is willing to  believe in Intrexon. Just as Kirk sold New River Pharma to Share  for $2.6 billion in 2006, and sold Clinical Data for Forest Labs  for $1.2 billion in 2011, he could pull it off again.', '  “I think he deserves the benefit of the doubt here,” Cramer said.', '  However while there could be opportunity in Intrexon, Cramer  think it is best to only invest in this stock for speculation and  to not utilize any retirement funds for this stock.', 'Read More  Cramer: The Street fight over Intrexon ', '  Cramer has watched as investors continue to wait for the big  event or news that will send the market down gigantically, to  slay the bulls and finally bring in the bear.

In total, there were  240 stocks in bear market territory as of Friday, and the number  was a lot larger if taken from Tuesday’s bottom.', '  “For many stocks, we are already discounting a pretty severe  recession. And if you include last Tuesday’s lows, I could argue  that most sectors have entered vicious bear markets,” Cramer  said.', '  Ultimately, when Cramer looked at stocks in the market he  realized that the rate hike is being built in every day that it  is down.

Thiagasamudram thinks so.', '  “The reason they are expensive is because of the type of  technology,” he told CNBC. “We are known for accuracy and quality  of the sound.”', '  He didn’t anticipate Apple eliminating the headphone jack, but  the recent news has certainly helped Audeze’s sales. The company  has been selling more Lightning-compatible headphones over the  last few months as rumors of the new iPhone circulated,  Thiagasamudram said, and traffic to Audeze’s website has  quadrupled. ', '  Libratone is also betting on customers valuing quality and unique  features more than price. The Danish company said pre-ordering  for its $179 Q Adapt in-ear headphones will begin in late  September. The headphones will ship in mid-October.', '  While interest in the company’s product has spiked since Apple’s  new iPhone announcement, Libratone President Mike Culver insists  the timing is coincidental.', '  “We started on this project over a year ago,” he told CNBC. “This  is not tied to the iPhone 7 launch at all. We would have done  this either way, regardless of whether they took out the  headphone jack.”', '  Either way, the company appears certain to benefit from Apple’s  dramatic shift away from the headphone jack. That’s because  Libratone uses the Lightning connector to provide greater power  for its new headphones, which offer adjustable noise cancellation — a feature that lets users decide how much external noise they  want to hear. ', '  This functionality requires a lot of power, Culver said. For  typical headphones, that would mean attaching a battery pack that  needs to be recharged. Using the Lightning port allows the  headphones to harness extra power without comprising a sleek  design.', '  Yet for those who don’t need the frills of noise cancellation or  professional-level sound quality, electronics and lighting  manufacturer Brightech provides a cheaper alternative. The  company has been selling Lightning-compatible headphones since  December 2015: Its in-ear option costs $49.99, while the  over-ear option costs $39.99.', '   “We’re looking for people that don’t have $300 to spend,  who need things but have to be able to afford it,” said Mark  Adelman, Brightech’s retail manager. He said the company  typically sells 20 to 50 Lightning-compatible headphones each  month. Since rumors about Apple eliminating the headphone jack  surfaced last week, they’ve seen a nearly threefold increase in  sales, he said.']"

31,Michael Kors is fed up with department stores damaging its brand,2016-08-10T15:43:13+0000,"[' Michael Kors has  had enough with department stores’ excessive discounting.', '  After reporting a 7 percent decline in its wholesale business  during the fiscal first quarter, CEO John Idol told analysts that  come February, the accessories brand will no longer participate  in department stores’ broad-based friends and family sales, or  accept coupons for its products there. ', '  The label will also move forward with its strategy to cut back on  the amount of merchandise it ships to these retailers, as it  looks to rebuild the pricing power it’s lost with shoppers.  Because the brand is constantly on sale, consumers have forgotten  the true value of the product, Idol said. ', '  These discounts once again damaged its revenue and profit margins  in both wholesale and stand-alone stores, Idol added. Michael  Kors’ same-store sales slid 7.4 percent during the fiscal first  quarter, steeper than Retail Metrics’ forecast for a 4.2 percent  decline.', '  “It’s creating confusion in the consumers’ mind relative to the  value of the Michael Kors brand when it’s being seen so often on  sale in so many different places,” Idol said. “We have to correct  something that we think is actually having a negative long-term  effect for the brand.” ', '  Because of this pullback, Idol told investors they should expect  to see further degradation at department stores for the remainder  of the year and into 2017. The company has already started  dialing back the number of goods it sends to department stores, a  strategy it had previously announced. ', '  Kors’ comments come just one day after competitor Coach said that it  will exit about  25 percent of the 1,000 department stores where it sells its  product. Like Kors, Coach is trying to regain control over the  prices charged for its handbags. Unlike Coach, Kors will not pull  its brand from any locations. ', '  Michael Kors’ products are sold at retailers  including Nordstrom and Bloomingdale’s. Macy’s generates the largest  chunk of its wholesale revenue and accounted for 12.7 percent of  its total sales last year.', '  The company reported fiscal first-quarter earnings of 88 cents a share on revenue of  $987.9 million. That compares with 87 cents a share and $986  million in sales during the prior-year period. Analysts had been  expecting the company to report earnings per share of 74 cents on  revenue of $953 million, according to Thomson Reuters  estimates.', 'Also hurting Kors during the quarter was a slowdown in travelers  visiting the United States, with sales in tourist-dependent  cities including New York getting hit particularly hard.  Shoppers’ preference for smaller handbags, which carry a lower  price tag, once again weighed on the company’s sales.', '  Still, management maintained its full-year guidance for revenue and earnings per share, saying it expects growth in its men’s,  digital and international businesses to offset the decline at  department stores. The label will likewise launch smartwatches  and smart jewelry in September, which management said should  moderate some of the slide it’s experienced in its watch  business. That was the brand’s weakest-performing category in the  quarter, posting a double-digit sales decline.', '  For the full year, management expects revenue to come in flat,  at roughly $4.7 billion, with earnings per share between $4.56  and $4.64. The company did, however, lower its outlook for  comparable sales. It now expects this metric to decline in a  mid-single-digit range, versus its prior guidance for a  low-single-digit drop. Its fiscal second-quarter earnings per share  guidance likewise fell short of Wall Street’s expectations.', '  “I don’t want you to think that we don’t understand there will be  a decline in certain categories because of this,” Idol said. “We  absolutely understand that and quite frankly want that because we  want to ship less units at lower prices ... that is not the way  ultimately to build a luxury business.”', '  Instead, the company plans to sell fewer units at higher prices  — something Idol said should, over time, balance out on  its top line.', '  Investors weren’t quite as convinced. Shares of Michael Kors were lower Wednesday, even after the wholesale  category posted a much narrower decline than analysts had  expected. Michael Kors’ reliance on department stores, where it  generated 40 percent of its sales during the quarter, has been  one of the biggest concerns among bearish investors.', '  “We continue to believe the brand is overdistributed, and while  the company is doing the right thing by reducing exposure to the  wholesale channel, we believe much of the damage has been done,”  Citi analyst Paul Lejuez said.']"

', '“This is one the few political third-rail items because lawmakers are essentially voting for a process that would allow bases and installations to potentially in their districts and states to be closed or downsized,” said Roman Schweizer, a defense analyst at Cowen.', 'No doubt, base closings are a politically unpopular idea for members of Congress, with some analysts likening it to a “hot potato” because of the general uneasiness of lawmakers to support something could result in job losses and economic hardship back home.', '“We cannot afford for parochial interests to get in the way of what is the best interests of our troops,” Rep. Adam Smith, Democrat of Washington, said in comments last week in support of the study of new base closures.', 'Earlier this year, Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain, Republican of Arizona, called member hesitation to revisit base closings “cowardice” because he believes it provides money being wasted that could go to more pressing defense needs.', 'A Pentagon study from 2016 warned there is “significant excess capacity” in the nation’s military infrastructure and urged Congress to take action to generate savings. Overall, it estimates there is 22 percent excess basing capacity across the Department of Defense, with the Army and Air Force having the most and the Navy the least, based on projected force levels in 2019.', 'In its fiscal 2018 budget request, the Trump administration asked Congress to authorize what’s known as a Base Realignment and Closure, or BRAC, round, which would formally study the possible closing or realignment of military facilities. In some cases, BRAC process could lead to the expansion of military facilities.', 'The 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, legislation which sets forth the Pentagon’s budget and major programs for the next fiscal year, passed the House last Friday but contains a provision blocking funding for a new BRAC round. A measure sponsored by California Republican Rep. Tom McClintock to strike the language from the final NDAA failed last week.', '“When we squander billions of dollars keeping obsolete military bases open in order to satisfy congressional constituencies, we directly rob our military forces of the resources that we’re constantly reminded that they desperately need,” McClintock said last week on the House floor in arguments in favor of his pro-BRAC legislation.', 'While the House’s version of the NDAA doesn’t include funding for a new BRAC round, there’s still a chance the Senate might allow it. The full Senate still has to vote on the NDAA, which cleared the Senate Armed Services Committee last month and also would bar funding for reducing bases.', 'Yet McCain has a draft proposal that would open the door to another BRAC and possible base closures. Rhode Island Democrat Sen. Jack Reed, ranking member of the committee, also signed on to the McCain effort, but it’s unclear whether there’s broad support in the chamber for another round of base closures.', 'Pentagon officials have said a new BRAC round, once completed, could capture savings of approximately $20 billion over 10 years.', '“The bottom line is that Congress refusing to allow a BRAC is forcing the military to spend money that it doesn’t want to spend and doesn’t need to spend,” said Christopher Preble, vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, a Washington think-tank.', 'Preble said a new BRAC round wouldn’t mean denying the military land it might need in the future, but said it’s about “rationalizing what properties they have and what they need.”', 'When including all five of the previous BRAC rounds since the 1980s, there have been annual savings estimated at more than $12 billion – and nearly $5 billion alone from the last one in 2005.', 'Money savings from a new round of BRAC would be enough to buy 22 F-18 Hornet fighter jets or four Virginia-class submarines, according to McClintock. It also could buy another large batch of F-35 stealth fighters. ', '“BRAC reduces fixed costs they would have with infrastructure,” said Frederico Bartels, policy analyst for defense budgeting at the Heritage Foundation, a Washington think tank. “That is the only way at getting at those fixed costs because there are a long of congressional limitations placed on what DoD can do with its physical infrastructure.”', 'Heritage Foundation supports a new round of BRAC to “right-size” the DOD infrastructure, saying it would allow the Pentagon to do “a rigorous and transparent review of its current and future infrastructure needs, including closing bases and facilities as appropriate.” Even so, the conservative think tank also believes “some excess infrastructure may be worth keeping, as a hedge against future needs.”', 'Some of the opposition for another round of base closures comes from lawmakers who say the costs of consolidation are too high and that local communities depend on these bases for their livelihood.', 'Mandy Smithberger, director of the Straus Military Reform Project at the Project on Government Oversight, said the federal government usually helps communities adjust to base closures. She also said a U.S. Government Accountability Office study found that communities closed under the last BRAC round in 2005 actually did better under the Great Recession than average communities across the country.', '“There are ways to have soft landings,” said Smithberger.', 'However, there are others who suggest a new round of BRAC should wait until President Donald Trump completes his plans to expand the military, including his stated goal to add more troops.', 'Also, some congressional critics of the BRAC program maintain that the 2005 consolidation ended up having savings below original expectations.', 'The 2005 BRAC was advertised originally by the Pentagon of having an implementation cost of about $21 billion, but that number grew to about $35.1 billion, largely reflecting cost overruns from construction costs. It impacted 24 facilities nationally and resulted in the relocation of around 125,000 people, including troops, their families and civilian employees.', 'Even though the last BRAC round did turn out to be perhaps more expensive than expected, proponents of the process say it wasn’t entirely a base closure program but was a realignment of large facilities. There also were several projects related to support the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, including training and operations support.', 'Cato’s Preble said resistance in Congress to another BRAC comes from a misconception that when a military base closes it always means bad news for local communities and that they can’t bounce back.', '“There’s’ a lot of resistance on Capitol Hill, unfortunately. There’s a belief that when a base closes it has a devastating impact on the surrounding communities. And my research shows that that’s not actually the case.”', 'Added Preble: “In most cases, the surrounding community finds a way to redirect those resources to more productive ends and they end up – sometimes quite quickly – with a much more diverse economic base. They have a stronger workforce, better pay, and are less dependent on a single source.”', 'As an example, he said when Philadelphia’s Naval Shipyard closed in the 1990s it was “a grim time and people were pretty pessimistic.” But he said the area bounced back and today is “just unbelievable” with a business building commercial ships and private businesses and retail establishments.', 'He also cited the success following the closure of Naval Air Station Brunswick in Maine, part of the 2005 BRAC round. The facility was turned over to civilian use and attracted new companies and development, adding significant property tax revenue for local communities and new jobs. Likewise, Austin’s Bergstrom Air Force Base, located seven miles outside downtown, was closed and later converted to a commercial airport serving the growing community.', '“The Austin airport is now a huge, modern airport that Austin was desperate to build for a long, long time,” said Preble. “The closure of the Air Force base, in many respects, solved a critical problem for the city.”']"

(He and Mr. Munger both believe that Berkshire is better off intact, but Mr. Buffett thinks investors’ knee-jerk reaction will be to believe the opposite.)', 'When it comes to Amazon (or Alphabet, or any of the new conglomerates), the question is whether there is something fundamentally different about these businesses given their grounding in digital information — especially as they expand into complex brick-and-mortar operations like upscale supermarkets.', 'In an age of big data and artificial intelligence, are businesses that look disparate really similar? And can one company’s leadership really oversee so many different businesses? When does it become too big to manage?', 'Google’s own internal list of top-10 principles seems to include an anti-conglomerate provision: “It’s best to do one thing really, really well.”', 'Leaving aside the question of whether that maxim may have been more suitable to the Google of a decade ago, it certainly hasn’t stopped the company from jumping into all sorts of businesses outside its flagship search and advertising business. Some of these businesses — which include Android, YouTube, Waze, Nest Labs, self-driving cars and internet distribution — have been more successful than others. Most of these were brought under the Google umbrella through acquisition, evidence of how the company has used the enormous proceeds of its advertising business to subsidize its entrance into all sorts of other enterprises.', 'Facebook, too, is expanding its offerings through acquisition, buying Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus VR. And for now, there are no obvious signs that looking after a wider array of businesses is weakening the management at Alphabet, Facebook or, for that matter, Amazon.', 'In fact, a recent article in the Yale Law Journal made a compelling case that Amazon has built perhaps the ultimate economic mousetrap — one impervious to the natural life cycle of a conglomerate, but one that might ultimately prove to be anticompetitive.', 'The author, Lina M. Khan, a Yale Law student who has written about antitrust law and competition policy, argued that Amazon had created a “platform market” and can use its size and scale to subsidize its entrance into new businesses through predatory pricing.', '“The economics of platform markets create incentives for a company to pursue growth over profits, a strategy that investors have rewarded,” Ms. Khan wrote. “Under these conditions, predatory pricing becomes highly rational — even as existing doctrine treats it as irrational and therefore implausible.”', 'Even more provocatively, she contends that Amazon’s role as both a distributor and cloud provider for many of its competitors gives it an unfair advantage. “This dual role also enables a platform to exploit information collected on companies using its services to undermine them as competitors,” Ms. Khan wrote.', 'Amazon has thus far been left alone by regulators because it has helped reduce prices of most products. It is not a natural monopoly. “Can prices ever be ‘too low’?” the Federal Trade Commission asks on its website. “The short answer is yes, but not very often.”', ' On its webpage about predatory pricing, the agency explains how the government thinks about competition. “A firm’s independent decision to reduce prices to a level below its own costs does not necessarily injure competition, and, in fact, may simply reflect particularly vigorous competition.”', 'That may be true. But in Amazon’s case, it has the potential to become so dominant in so many areas that its impact could be more than simply lowering prices for consumers; it could put large companies out of business.', 'Were that to happen, this new breed of Silicon Valley conglomerates may become more powerful — and resilient — than the 20th-century conglomerates of yore.', 'If Amazon were to use its acquisition of Whole Foods, along with the profits from its other businesses, to lower prices so much that it put out of business a company like Walmart, with its 1.5 million United States employees, would that be a good outcome? Or is that just a natural part of capitalism?', 'The view of Amazon’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is clear. The man who is assembling the 21st century’s most fearsome new conglomerate once explained his view of competition this way: “Your margin is my opportunity.”']"

37,The big problem Apple must fix before it launches a car,2015-02-20T20:09:27+0000,"['  Before Apple can even consider  rolling out an iCar, it still has one major problem to fix: Apple  Maps. ', '  The company from Cupertino, California, has struggled to catch up  to Google in the mapping  space. But if the iPhone maker is serious about building its own  vehicle, and owning both the software and hardware side of it,  then improving its maps is critical. ', '  “Thank God the Apple Car is not launching today because that  would be a major issue,” said Gene Munster, technology analyst at  Piper Jaffray. “Let me put it this way, if they don’t fix maps,  the car is not going to launch. They need it. But I think they  will fix it, it’s that big of a problem.”', ' Read More Apple aims to begin  production of electric car by 2020: report', '  While the tech giant made its first big entrance when it launched  CarPlay, it’s likely that its ultimate vision is much larger than  integrating its software into the car experience, Munster  said. His price target is $160 and his stock rating is  overweight.', '“Everything we have ever talked to Apple about, they have wanted  to build both the hardware and software. If they want to be true  to that mantra, then they are going to do the whole car,” he said.  “It makes perfect sense, it’s an industry that hasn’t really  changed in a hundred years.”', ' Read More The real battle Apple is  waging in autos', '  According to a Bloomberg report on Thursday the company may want  to roll out an electric car as soon  as 2020. But before it can transform the car into the next  iPhone, it needs to make sure it can get people from point A to  point B, industry experts said. ', '  Apple’s Maps system was heavily criticized after its launch in  2012 because of glitches and inaccuracies. CEO Tim Cook even  issued a statement on the company’s website apologizing to users  for how bad the service was. Since then the company has made  investments to improve its mapping system.', '  For example, in October the company launched its Apple Maps  Connect program, which let local businesses create and add  details to listings to make information more accurate. ', '  But the company still has a ways to go, said Bob O’Donnell,  founder and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research.', ' Read More How tech giants are going  to take over your car', '  “The level of expectations people have around maps now is very  high. It is an essential part of any device these days. Mobile  devices need good mapping, and any car needs high quality  mapping,” he said. ', '  Unlike Munster, O’Donnell doesn’t see Apple building a car from  the ground up just yet. Instead he sees Apple building electronic  parts for the automobile. The need for them to keep improving  their maps service is indisputable because they need accurate  location data to support all kinds of other services, O’Donnell  said. ', '  “Mapping is also a gateway to location-based services, which is  very, very important. It’s a core data set that you got to have, and you want to have it built in your own particular way, and the  only way you are going to do that is by having your mapping data  because then you could build your own ecosystem around that  mapping data,” he said.', '  In other words, good mapping data helps Apple keep application  developers who build location-based services on its platform and gives it the ability to control how people interact with  that data. ', '  Maps aren’t the only challenge the iPhone maker will face as it  looks to enter the auto space in a big way. ', ' Read MoreApple faces lawsuit for alleged auto  engineer poaching', 'For one thing, the previously reported five-year time horizon is really optimistic, industry experts said. ', '  “Getting a car into production by 2020 and building out a  reliable supply chain in that shortened design period will be  tough. Far more challenging than sourcing parts and shipping  iPhones and iPads around the globe,” said Lou Basenese, founder  of Disruptive Tech Research. ', '  Unlike Apple’s iPhone production, the company cannot outsource  car manufacturing to FoxConn, Munster said. First they would have  to either make an acquisition of a car company or buy their own  manufacturing plant, he said. ', '  Like Tesla, Apple could also face strong opposition from the  traditional dealer networks. Tesla has become a target for its  showrooms, which enable people to order customized Model S  electric vehicles directly from the factory. ', '  Multiple states have taken legal action banning the company from  establishing these showrooms because they say direct retailing of the cars is a violation of state automotive franchise rules. If  Apple goes this route, it may experience the same kind of  setback, Munster said. ', '  “If you are in the car business, you have to create car dealers  and then you have to figure out how to create the cars and then  you have to be backlogged with car parts for 10 years because  people keep their cars for 10 years. And so there are many other  elements to cars that are so far beyond what Apple has ever done.  I think there are a lot of challenges,” O’Donnell said.', '  “It’s not that they couldn’t do it. They have got enough money to  do anything. But is that the most effective use of their money?  The most effective way to expand? And nobody knows.”']"

Canada supplies about half of the nearly 8 million barrels a day of oil imported by the U.S.', 'On Friday, President Donald Trump kept a campaign promise, as the State Department approved the 800,000 barrel a day northern leg of the Keystone pipeline. Held up for years by the Obama administration, the pipeline is planned to take oil from the Canadian sands in Alberta down to Steele City, Neb., where it could then head either to the Gulf Coast or Midwest refineries.', '“No surprise here on the Keystone decision. It was clearly going to be reversed. The decision not to build Keystone by the Obama Administration was never really about Keystone. The State Department, in reviewing it, had indicated that it would have no impact on carbon emissions. Rather, the Obama decision was about symbolism and the Paris climate conference,” said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit.', 'Yergin said the question now is how much oil from the Canadian sands will be shipped by rail and how much by pipeline, once the Keystone is built.', '“It does on the margin allow more of that heavy crude to make it to the refineries, which is a a positive, or be exported,” said Bart Melek, head of commodities strategy at TD Securities. “Really we’re just talking incremental here. It’s not really moving the needle either way. It just assures some of the plans to expend the sands continues and we don’t have to use trains. They’re expensive, and it’s not an efficient way to move crude.”', 'The Canadian sands, including upgraded synthetic crude, is expected to expand production to 5.3 million barrels a day by 2022, from 4.5 million barrels a day in 2016, according to the International Energy Agency. Canada also plans to increase pipeline capacity with the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain Expansion, which would take crude across Western Canada to British Columbia, for export to Asia. That project was approved by the Canadian government but is still pending local approval.', 'The sands has made gains in carbon emissions, though it is considered a dirtier source of crude, Yergin said. The cost per barrel is also higher than that of U.S. shale. But the additional oil would easily find a place in the world market, analyst say.', 'The heavy oil could displace oil that comes from other places outside the U.S., like Saudi Arabia or Iraq. Some heavy crude suppliers have seen waning production in recent years, like Mexico and Venezuela.', '“If we get additional quantities of heavy Canadian crude, which is preferred by many refineries in the U.S., we might turn out to sell more quantities of [U.S.] light, sweet crude to the rest of the world,” said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates.', 'The Gulf Coast refineries mainly refine heavy crudes, whereas U.S. shale drillers pump light, sweet crude. Light, sweet crude is mainly refined on the east and west coasts.', '“All this additional crude oil should keep our input costs lower, which will make our refined products even more competitive,” said John Kilduff of Again Capital. The U.S. is a net exporter of refined product already. Government data shows that the U.S. last week exported 1.2 million barrels a day of distillates, which includes fuels like diesel. The U.S. also exported 592,000 barrels a day of gasoline last week.', 'The U.S. exported an average 520,000 million barrels a day of oil last year, and much of that goes to Canada for refininig. ', 'The Keystone XL pipeline must get final approvals from Nebraska and local landowners. Kyle Cooper, a consultant with Ion Energy Group, said there are still groups opposed to its construction. “I think the Trump administration is going to roll over the opposition groups and it will be done,” he said, adding construction is not expected to be complete until well into 2018.', '“This pipeline will give the Canadian sands a better net back. It’s cheaper to use a pipeline than rail or truck. Their break-even just got lowered, and their economic incentive just improved. One thing you can say is that over the last 10 years, the North American E and P producer knows how to respond to economic signals. If there’s a dollar to be made, they’re going to get at how to make it. The Keystone pipleline will certainly give them the opportunity to make a buck,” Cooper said.', 'Cooper also said exports from the U.S. could increase, whether it is Canadian oil directly, or more U.S. crude or refined product.

Unemployment stands at 2.3  percent, well below the national average. Household median income  is more than $83,000, well above the national average. And  construction workers plug away on the city’s much needed  infrastructure projects.', '  But there’s no denying that optimism, so prevalent  here a year ago, is mixing with caution for many in this North Dakota boomtown that has  come to symbolize America’s energy revolution.', '  In the mid-2000s, a few pioneering drillers realized that  hydraulic fracking would let them unlock crude in North Dakota’s  massive Bakken Shale play. Before long, the whole industry was  scrambling to set up operations in the region. Thousands of  out-of-state workers flooded in, looking to land a high-paying  job. Nearly everyone seemed to be headed for Williston, the tiny  town at the heart of the Bakken.', '  In 2007, Williston’s population was just over 12,000. Today, it’s  nearly 31,000. And the town’s economic expansion has experienced  the same meteoric rise. Over that same period, 25,000 jobs were  created. More than 1,300 businesses were launched. Restaurants  and hotels were built. Hospitals and community centers were  overhauled.', ' Read MoreInside North Dakota’s  latest fracking problem', '  But with the price of oil now well off its 2014 highs of over  $100 a barrel, many drillers have cut back on their Bakken  positions, announcing layoffs, or pulling out of the state  altogether. WTI crude oil prices recently were trading under $40  a barrel.', ' Continental  Resources, one of the companies that led the fracking  revolution in the state, stopped completing wells in the third  quarter of last year. Whiting Petroleum, one of the state’s biggest  producers, made the same announcement last month. They’ll  wait for oil prices to climb before they frack the wells. That  means hundreds of wells won’t produce any oil, and thousands  workers will be without jobs.', '  As drillers have left Williston, so have many of the men and  women who came to the city looking for work. In 2014, the  workforce in Williams County topped out at 43,000. That figure is  down to 34,000. And it’s the combination of lower oil prices and  more modest growth that has some locals and oil watchers  concerned that leaner times could be on the horizon.', '  “It is definitely a different mindset now,” said Andy Njos.', '  Andy and his cousin Aaron Volesky started Dacotah West Crane  Services in 2011. “Drillers have had to cut costs, and we have to  figure out how to do jobs cheaper,” Andy said.', '  The duo bought their first crane in Houston and took two weeks to  drive the machinery 1,600 miles back to their home town of  Williston. ', '  They were the first among friends to cash in on the oil rush, but  they would not be the last. Success came quickly. The cousins  worked long hours, but couldn’t keep up with the seemingly  endless flow of work orders by themselves. They grew out of  necessity.', '  In just a few years, they expanded their fleet to nine cranes,  hired 25 workers, and built a new corporate headquarters.', '  In 2014, revenues at Dacotah West peaked with the price of oil.  Since then, business is down 50 percent. Andy Njos shed overtime  shifts, cut his staff to 10, and returned any equipment he did  not own outright.', ' Read More North  Dakota wakes up to hangover as oil swoons', '  “We’ve had to downsize. We had to restructure the company,” said  Njos. “We went from nine to four cranes.”', '  Njos says his business is OK, thanks in no small part to how  quickly he and his cousin scaled down overhead costs.

It’s, ‘Wait until oil prices go  up a little bit,’” he said. “Everyone’s just trying to survive.”', '  The cousins aren’t the only business owners feeling the pinch.  Marcus Jundt, a Minneapolis-based developer, opened the Williston  Brewing Company in North Dakota in 2013. The restaurant has been  a hit, with revenues cut in half. When times were good, every  night was busy at his restaurant, and a two-hour wait for a table  was not uncommon. But Jundt says his customer base took a steep  drop last year.', '  “It varies week to week, but every week keeps getting worse,” he  said. “We don’t know where the bottom is, but we’re not there  yet.”', '  Jundt has had to lay off friends. His restaurant, like many other  businesses in Williston, has had to cut wages. He says workers  who aren’t tied to Williston are leaving. Without the high  paychecks to keep them rooted, and a national economy that’s  better than it was a few years ago, many out-of-state workers are  leaving to find jobs closer to home.', '  “Since we opened this restaurant three years ago, 32 restaurants  have opened up,” said Jundt. “There are too many restaurants for  the number of people we have. But I think you can say that about  gas stations, apartment buildings, houses. Almost everything in  town is overbuilt.”', '  Hotels have also seen business decline. In January, the city’s  occupancy rate fell to 27 percent, compared with 62 percent in  2015. That’s a dramatic shift from a few years ago, when parking  lots were filled with men sleeping in their cars because they  couldn’t find a place to stay. Trailers without running water  were fetching as much as $2,500 a month.', '  Capital Lodge — one of the Bakken’s largest crew camps  — now sits abandoned. The 1,100-bed temporary housing  facility east of Williston cost $40 million to build. The camp  went under after the county raised annual permitting fees,  coupled with plummeting demand for beds.', '  While there are female oil workers, the crew camps have become  known as “man camps.”', '  Another “man camp” operator, Target Logistics, has 3,900 beds on  12 properties spread across the Bakken. Their occupancy hovers  between 40 percent and 50 percent. Other camps in Williston, with  names like “Black Gold” and “ATCO,” have been abandoned or torn  down.', '  Beyond the oil patch, agriculture is a big economic driver in  North Dakota. Top agricultural products include wheat,  cattle and calves and soybeans. ', '  Despite all the challenges, many in Williston remain cautiously  optimistic.

Yes,” Wenko wrote  in an op-ed for the Grand Forks  Herald last month. “But he oil and gas  industry, as it has always done in the past, is going to recover  from this.”', '  Wenko says while some projects may be put on hold, he does expect  them to be completed.', '  “We are at a crossroads in developing the future of the City of  Williston. We can chose to dwell in the now or we can plan for  the future,” Wenko said.', '  And while construction on apartment complexes and hotels is  slowing, developers are shifting focus to the region’s more  pressing pipeline needs.', '  “Right now, we don’t have enough pipeline capacity to put [Bakken  crude] in pipes and get it down to Cushing, Oklahoma,” a major  energy hub, said Patrick McGarry, a property consultant who moved  to Williston six years ago.

The project, headed by a  subsidiary of Energy  Transfer Partners, received approval from regulators in Iowa  on Thursday, ending the last major permitting hurdle for the  pipeline. The plan has already been approved in North Dakota,  South Dakota and Illinois.', '  When completed, the 1,100-mile pipeline will transport 450,000 to  570,000 barrels of Bakken crude oil to existing pipelines in  Illinois every day. That’s half of the 1 million barrels that is  produced in the region daily. It also helps solve one of the  biggest problems facing Bakken oil producers — getting their  oil to out-of-state refiners. Currently, about half of the crude  that leaves the Bakken travels to refiners by rail, which takes  longer and is more costly.  ', '  “Right now, for example, it costs about $15 to ship oil from here  to Albany, per barrel,” said McGarry. “The discount should be  about half because of the pipelines.”', '  For McGarry, the changes taking place in Williston don’t signal  the end of success for America’s biggest boomtown. Instead, they  represent a change in the way success will be found by those  willing to stick it out.', '  “I still think there’s great opportunity here,” he says. “I  believe in the Bakken.

Its stock had already been up about 80 percent from a year ago.', 'Retailers competing with Amazon have also been trying to soak up some sales this week, offering their own deals events online. Target, which had a one-day sale running on its website, said Tuesday it was the “highest single day of traffic and sales of 2018” online so far for the company.', 'According to Adobe Analytics, retailers with more than $1 billion in revenue saw a 54 percent increase in sales compared with an average Tuesday.

50,"Augmented reality could be an $8 billion ‘revenue opportunity’ for Apple, analyst says",2018-07-10T15:44:02+0000,"['Apple’s move into augmented reality could boost iPhone and App Store sales, resulting in as much as $8 billion in revenue for the tech giant, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.', '“We think AR apps will command a price premium,” Wamsi Mohan, senior equity research analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. “We reiterate our Buy on strong capital returns, continued strong growth in Services revenues and AR providing yet another competitive advantage.”', 'The bank increased its price target from $225 to $230, about $40 above where the stock was trading Tuesday. Shares of Apple are up more than 30 percent year over year and 12 percent so far this year.', 'Augmented reality, or AR, puts virtual objects in the real world using a phone or iPad’s camera and lets users interact with those objects through their screen. One popular example was Nintendo’s 2016 Pokemon Go video game, which let users chase video game characters projected on their phone screens throughout city streets and other public areas.', 'Mohan says the “revenue opportunity” is for $6 billion to $8 billion in additional revenue from now until 2020 with $1 billion of that coming from AR apps and the rest coming from increased iPhone sales due to the new technology. If Apple were to introduce AR-specific eyewear, which is not factored into the bank’s current model, the revenue upside could be as much as $11 billion, he said.', 'More than 1 billion Apple devices are already equipped for augmented reality apps, which Mohan said makes iOS a logical and “extremely attractive” option for those developers.', 'It’s not just video game makers capitalizing on AR. The BofAML analyst highlighted retailers such as Lowes and Home Depot already using AR to help customers picture how countertops, floors, blinds or paint might look in their homes before buying them. The technology can also be used to market hotels and travel experiences, Mohan said.', 'Apple began shipping its first set of tools for developers to build augmented-reality apps on iPhones and iPads, known as the ARKit, last fall. Apple’s third version, the ARKit2, was released in early June. Google is also working on AR and released its own kit for developers called ARCore around the same time as Apple.']"
51,Read the full transcript of Trump’s first solo press conference,2017-02-16T21:51:55+0000,"['A full transcript of Trump’s first solo press conference follows.', '--------------------------------------------------------------------------------', 'I just wanted to begin by mentioning that the nominee for secretary of the Department of Labor will be Mr. Alex Acosta. He has a law degree from Harvard Law School, great student, former clerk for Justice Samuel Alito, and he has had a tremendous career. He’s a member and has been a member of the National Labor Relations Board, and he’s been through Senate confirmation three times, confirmed, did very, very well. And so Alex, I wished him the best. We just spoke, and he’s going to be a tremendous secretary of Labor. And, also, as you probably heard just a little while ago, Mick Mulvaney, former congressman, has just been approved, weeks late. I have to say that, weeks, weeks late, Office of Management and Budget, and he will be, I think, a fantastic addition. Paul Singer just left. As you know, he was very much involved with the anti-Trump or as they say, Never Trump, and Paul left and gave us total support. It’s all about unification. We’re unifying the party and hopefully we’ll unify the country. It’s very important to me. I’ve been talking about that for a long time, but it’s very, very important to me. I thank Paul for being here, coming up to the office, he was very strong opponent, and now he’s a very strong ally, and I appreciate that. I think I’ll say a few words and take some questions.', 'I had this time, we’ve been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible, including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible. Just absolutely catastrophic in terms of what was happening. And we’ve done some really good work and we’re proud of that. Right after that, you prepare yourselves for questions, unless you have no questions, that’s always a responsibility. I’m here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration.', 'We have made incredible progress. I don’t think there’s ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we’ve done.', 'A new Rasmussen poll, in fact, because the people get it, much of the media doesn’t get it, they actually get it but they don’t write it, let’s put it that way, but a new Rasmussen poll came out a short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up.', 'The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know, and there’s been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which means something different than it used to. Now it means it’s good for jobs. Very different. Plants and factories are already starting to move back into the United States, big league, Ford, General Motors. I’m making this presentation directly to the American people with the media present, which, it’s an honor to have you this morning because many of our nation’s reporters and folks will not tell you the truth and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve. And I hope going forward we can be a little bit different, and maybe get along a little bit better, if that’s possible. Maybe it’s not and that’s OK too. Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, DC, along with New York, Los Angeles, in particular, speaks not for the people, but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system.', 'The press has become so dishonest that if we don’t talk about it, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people. Tremendous disservice. We have to talk about it. We have to find out what’s going on because the press, honestly, is out of control. The level of dishonesty is out of control. I ran for president to represent the citizens of our country. I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well. I am talking, and really talking, on this very entrenched power structure and what we’re doing is we’re talking about the power structure. We’re talking about its entrenchment. As a result, the media’s going through what they have to go through to oftentimes distort — not all the time — and some of the media’s fantastic, I have to say, honest and fantastic — but much of it is not. The distortion, and we’ll talk about it, you’ll be able to ask me questions about it. We’re not going to let it happen because I’m here, again, to take my message straight to the people.', 'As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy. To be honest, I inherited a mess. A mess. At home, and abroad. A mess. Jobs are pouring out of the country. You see what’s going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places. Low pay, low wages.', 'Mass instability overseas, no matter where you look. The Middle East, a disaster. North Korea, we’ll take care of it, folks. We’re going to take care of it all. I just want to let you know. I inherited a mess. Beginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges. On foreign affairs, we’ve begun enormously productive talks with foreign leaders, much of which you’ve covered, to move forward to security, stability and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, which there are many.', 'We’ve had great conversations with the United Kingdom and meetings, Israel, Mexico, Japan, China and Canada. Really, really productive conversations. I would say far more productive than you would understand. We’ve even developed a new council with Canada to promote women’s business leaders and entrepreneurs. Very important to me. Very important to my daughter, Ivanka.', 'I have directed our defense community headed by our great general, now Secretary Mattis, he’s over there now working very hard, to submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS, a group that celebrates murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world. Used to be a small group. Now it’s in large sections of the world. They’ve spread like cancer. ISIS has spread like cancer.', 'Another mess I inherited. We have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, who has totally taken advantage of our previous administration. And they are the world’s top sponsor of terrorism. And we’re not going to stop until that problem is properly solved, and it’s not now. It’s one of the worst agreements I’ve ever seen drawn by anybody. I’ve ordered plans to begin for the massive rebuilding of the United States military.', 'I’ve had great support from the Senate. I’ve had great support from Congress, generally. We’ve pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military. I will tell you, that is my — I would be so happy if we never had to use it, but our country will never have had a military like the military we’re about to build and rebuild. We have the greatest people on earth in our military.', 'They don’t have the right equipment, and their equipment is old. I used it. I talked about it. At every stop. Depleted. It’s depleted. It won’t be depleted for long. One of the reasons I’m standing here instead of other people is, frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military. We have to have strong law enforcement also.', 'So we do not go abroad in the search of war. We really are searching for peace. It’s peace through strength. At home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the government to the people to a scale not seen in many, many years. In each of these actions, I’m keeping my promises to the American people. These are campaign promises. Some people are so surprised that we are having strong borders. Well that’s what I’ve been talking about for a year and a half, strong borders. They are so surprised. Oh, he is having strong borders. Well, that’s what I’ve been talking about to the press and everybody else.', 'One promise after another after years of politicians lying to you to get elected. They lied to the American people In order to get elected. Some of the things I’m doing probably aren’t popular, but they’re necessary for security and or other reasons. And then coming to Washington and pursuing their own interests, which is more important to many politicians.', 'I’m here following through on what I pledged to do. That’s all I’m doing. I put it out before the American people, got 306 electoral college votes. I wasn’t supposed to get 222. They said there’s no way to get 222. 230 is impossible. 270, which you need — that was laughable. We got 306. Because people came out and voted like they have never seen before. So that’s how it goes. I guess it was the biggest electoral college win since Ronald Reagan. In other words, the media is trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made, and they are not happy about it for whatever reason. And, but a lot of people are happy about it. In fact, I’ll be in Melbourne, Florida, at 5 on Saturday, and I heard, just heard the crowds are massive that want to be there. I turn on the TV, open the newspaper and I see stories of chaos. Chaos. Yet it is the exact opposite.', 'This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine. Despite the fact that I can’t get my Cabinet approved. They are outstanding people. Like Senator Dan Coats, who is there, one of the most respected men in the Senate. He can’t get approved. How do you not approve him? He’s been a colleague, highly respected, brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it, but were waiting for approval.', 'So we have a wonderful group of people that’s working very hard, that’s being very much misrepresented about, and we can’t let that happen.', 'So if the Democrats. all you have to do is look where they are right now. The only thing they can do is delay because they screwed things up royally. Believe me. Let me list things we’ve done in just a short period of time.', 'Just got here. I got here with no Cabinet. Again, each of the actions is a promise I made to the American people, going over just some of them. We have a lot in the next week and weeks coming. We have withdrawn from the job killing disaster known as Trans-Pacific Partnership. We’re going to have trade deals but we’re going to have one-on-one deals, bilateral. One-on-one deals.', 'We directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing and called for expedited approval of the permits needed for America and American infrastructure, meaning plants, equipment, roads, bridges, factories. People take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory. They go in for a permit, it’s many, many years, and at the end of the process, they spend tens of millions of dollars on nonsense, and at the end of the process, they are rejected. They may be rejected with me, but it’s going to be a quick rejection. Not going to take years, but, mostly, it’s acceptance. We want plants and factories built. We want the jobs. We don’t want the jobs going to other countries.', 'We’ve imposed a hiring freeze on nonessential federal workers. We’ve imposed a temporary moratorium and new federal regulations. We issued a game-changing new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. Makes sense. Nobody’s ever seen regulations like we have.', 'You go to other countries, and you look at industries they have, and you say, let me see your regulations. They are a fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have. I want regulations because I want safety. I want environmental, all environmental situations to be taken properly care of. It’s very important to me. You don’t need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing.', 'We’ve stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence. We’ve directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation — take a look at Chicago and others — taking place right now in our inner cities. Horrible. We’ve ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs. We’re becoming a drug-infested nation. Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars. We’re not going to let it happen any longer. We’ve undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our nation and our tax dollars safe and are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border.', '[I] met with general, now Secretary Kelly, yesterday, and we’re starting that process. And the wall is going to be a great wall, and it’s going to be a wall negotiated by me. The price is going to come down, just like on everything else I’ve negotiated for the government. And we’re going to have a wall that works. We’re not going to have a wall like they have now that is either nonexistent or a joke. We ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we’ve ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border. No more release. No matter who you are.', 'We’ve begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers, and others who pose a threat to public safety. We are saving American lives every single day. Court system has not made it easy for us. And we’ve even created a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of illegal immigrant violence, which there are many. We’ve taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. Though parts of our necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by judges, in my opinion, incorrect, an unsafe ruling.', 'Our administration is working night and day to keep you safe — including reporters — and is vigorously defending this lawful order. I will not back down from defending our country. I got elected on defending our country. I keep my campaign promises, and our citizens will be very happy when they see the result, they already are. I can tell you that. Extreme vetting will be put in place, and it already is in place in many places. In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number. I’ve heard 80 percent, I find that hard believe. That’s just a number I heard, that they are overturned 80 percent of the time. I think that circuit is — that circuit in chaos and that circuit is frankly in turmoil.', 'But we are appealing that and we are going further. We’re issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country, so we’ll be going along the one path and hopefully winning that. At the same time we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people and that’ll be done sometime next week in the beginning or middle at the latest part.', 'We’ve also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone pipeline and Dakota Access pipelines, thousands and thousands of jobs, and put new buy American measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines. In other words, they build a pipeline in this country and we use the powers of the government to make that pipeline happen, we want them to use American steel. And they are willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along. Even this order was drawn, and they didn’t say that and I’m reading the order and I say why aren’t we using American steel? They said, that’s a good idea. We put it in.', 'To drain the swamp of corruption in Washington D.C., I’ve started by imposing a five-year lobbying ban on White House officials, and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government.', 'We’ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare. Obamacare is a disaster, folks. It’s a disaster. You can say, oh, Obamacare. They fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they’re not the republican people that our representatives are representing. So, we’ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back. Bring our jobs back to this country, big league.', 'It’s already happening. Big league. ', 'I’ve also worked to install a Cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats. You’ve seen what they’ve done over the last long number of years. That will be one of the great cabinets ever assembled in American history. You look at Rex Tillerson. He’s out there negotiating right now. General Mattis I mentioned before. General Kelly. We have great, great people, makers with us now. We have great people. Among their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens.', 'Now look, fair trade. Not free. Fair. If a country is taking advantage of us, we’re not going to let that happen anymore. You know, every country takes advantage of us, almost. I may be able to find a couple that don’t, but for the most part, that would be a tough job for me to do. Jobs have already started to surge. Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico, and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs. Fiat Chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan creating 2,000 new american jobs. They were with me a week ago. You know, you were here. General Motors likewise committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave, and if I didn’t get elected, believe me, they would have left, and these jobs, these things that I’m announcing would never have come here.', 'Intel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with. And that will result in at least 10,000 American jobs. Wal-mart announced it will create 10,000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives. They’ll be many, many more, many more. These are a few that we’re naming.  Other countries have been taken advantage of us for decades, decades, and decades and decades, folks, and we’re not going to let that happen anymore. Not going to let it happen.', 'And one more thing, I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our constitution. Highly respected. Should get the vote from the Democrats. You may not see that, but he’ll get there one way or another. He should get there the old fashioned way, and he should get those votes. This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country. Again, I say it, there’s never been a presidency that’s done so much in such a short period of time, and we haven’t even started the big work that starts early next week. Some very big things are going to be announced next week. So we’re just getting started. We will be giving a speech as I said in Melbourne, Florida, at 5 p.m., I hope to see you there. And with that, I just say God bless America, and let’s take some questions.', 'Mara? Mara, go ahead, you were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference.', 'Reporter: [ inaudible ]', 'Mike Flynn is a wonderful person, and I asked for resignation, he respectfully gave it. He is a man who there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who’s with us today, and I was not happy with the way that information was given. He didn’t have to do that because what he did wasn’t wrong. What he did in terms of the information he saw. What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves, in this room, were given that information. Because that was classified information that was given illegally. That’s the real problem.', 'You know, you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all, you know,  “fake news” fabricated deal to try to make up for the loss of the Democrats and the press plays right into it. In fact, I saw a couple of the people supposedly involved with all of this. They know nothing about it, never in Russia, never made a phone call, never received a phone call. It’s all fake news. It’s all fake news.', 'The nice thing is I see it starting to turn where people are now looking at the illegal — I think it’s very important — the illegal giving out classified information, and let me just tell you, it was given out so much.', 'For example, I called, as you know, Mexico. It was a very confidential classified call, but I called Mexico, and in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well that’s nice, I spoke to the president of Mexico, had a good call, all the sudden it’s out there for the world to see. It was supposed to be secret.', 'Supposed to be either confidential or classified in that case, same thing with Australia. All of the sudden, people are finding out exactly what took place. The same thing happened with respect to General Flynn. Everybody saw this.', 'And I’m saying, the first thing I thought of when I heard about it, is how does the press get this information that’s classified? How do they do it? You know why? Because it’s an illegal process, and the press should be ashamed of themselves, but more importantly, the people that gave out information to the press should be ashamed of themselves. Really a shame.', 'Trump: Yes, go ahead.', 'Reporter: Why did you keep your vice president in the dark for almost two weeks?', 'Trump: Because when I looked at the information, I said, I don’t think he did anything wrong. If anything, he did something right. He was coming into office, looked at the information, and he said, “huh, that’s fine.” That’s what they are supposed to do.', 'They are supposed to be — he just didn’t call Russia, he called, and spoke to both ways, I think, there were 30-some odd countries, just doing his job. You know, he was just doing his job.', 'The thing is he didn’t tell our vice president properly, and then he said he didn’t remember, so either way, it wasn’t very satisfactory to me. And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position, and that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision, but he didn’t tell the vice president of the United States the facts, and then he didn’t remember, and that just wasn’t acceptable to me. Yes?', 'Reporter: Since you brought up Russia, I’m looking for some clarification here. During the campaign, did anyone from your team communicate with members of the Russian government or Russian intelligence, and if so, what was the nature of the conversations?', 'Trump: Well, the failing New York Times wrote a big long front page story yesterday, and it was very much discredited, as you know. It was— it’s a joke. The people mentioned in the story, I noticed they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia.', 'They weren’t even a part, really, I mean, there was such a minor part. I had not spoken to them—I think the one person, I don’t think I’ve ever spoken to him or ever met him, and he actually said he was a very low level member of, I think, committee for a short period of time. I don’t think I ever met him.', 'Now it’s possible I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I never met him, I never talked to him ever, and he thought it was a joke. The other person said he never spoke to Russia, never received a call, looked at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera, and the other person people knew that he represented various countries, but I don’t think he represented Russia, but represented various countries. That’s what he does. People know that. That’s Mr. Manafort, by the way, a respected man, a respected man, but I think he represented the Ukraine or Ukraine government or somebody, but everybody knew that. Everybody knew that. So these people... and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia. He said that very forcefully. I saw his statement. He said it forcefully. Most of the papers do not print it because it’s not good for their stories.', 'So the three people they talked about all totally deny it, and I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I don’t have any deals in Russia.', 'President Putin called me up nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election. He called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific, but so did almost all other leaders from almost all other countries.', 'That’s the exception. Russia is fake news. Russia — this is fake news put out by the media. The real news is the fact that there are people probably from the Obama administration because they are there. We have new people going in place right now, as you know, Mike Pompeo is now taking control of the CIA, James Comey at the FBI, Dan Coates is waiting to be approved. I mean, he’s a senator, a highly respected one, and he’s still waiting to be approved. But our new people are going in.', 'Just while you’re at it, because you mentioned this, the Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New York Times story yesterday. And it talked about — you saw it, front page — so director of national intelligence just put out, acting, a statement, any suggestion that the United States intelligence community — this was just given to us — is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the president and his national security team is not true.', 'So they took this front page story out of the Wall Street Journal top, and they just wrote the story, but it’s not true.', 'I’ll tell you something. I’ll be honest. I sort of enjoy this back and forth, and I guess I have all my life, but never seen more dishonest media than frankly the political media. I thought the financial media was much better and more honest, but I will say that I never get phone calls from the media.', 'How do they write a story like that in the Wall Street Journal without asking me or how do they write a story in the New York Times put it on the front page. That was the story they wrote about the women and me, front page, big massive story. And It was nasty. And then they called, they said, we never said that. We like Mr. Trump. They called up my office. We like Mr. Trump. We never said that.', 'And it was totally — they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women. I have to tell you. Totally misrepresented. I said, give us a retraction. They never gave us a retraction, and, frankly, I then went on to other things.', 'Okay. Go ahead.', 'Reporter: Mr. President, you said today that you have biggest electoral margins since Reagan with 350 electoral votes, and, in fact, president Obama got 365 -- [Trump mumbles in response] why should America — [ Trump tries to protest in response] why should America trust you when you accuse the — [ inaudible ]', 'Trump: Actually, I’ve seen that information around. It was a substantial difference, do you agree with that?', 'Reporter: You’re the president.', 'Trump: Okay. [laughing]', 'Reporter: Can you tell us, can you determine that General Flynn never wronged you? What evidence — did you ask your transcripts [inaudible] you said you’d aggressively pursue [inaudible]', 'Trump: We are.', 'Reporter: [inaudible] review of the intelligence community — what can you tell us?', 'Trump: First of all, about that. We now have Dan Coates, hopefully soon, Mike Pompeo, and James Comey, and they are in position, so I hope that we’ll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else. The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, a very successful man, and he’s offered his services, and you know, it’s something we may take advantage of, but I don’t think we’ll need that at all because of the fact that, you know, I think that we’re going to be able to straighten it out easily on its own.', 'As far as the general is concerned, when I first heard about it, I said, huh, that doesn’t sound wrong. My counsel came, Don McGahn, White House Counsel, and he told me, and I asked him, and he can speak very well for himself. He said he doesn’t think anything is wrong. You know, really didn’t think — really what happened after that — but he didn’t think anything was done wrong. I didn’t either, because I waited a period of time and thought about it. Well, I said I don’t see, to me, he was doing the job.', 'The information was provided by, who I don’t know, Sally Yates, and I was a little surprised because I said, “Doesn’t sound like he did anything wrong there,” but he did something wrong with respect to the Vice President, and I thought it was not acceptable as far as, as far as, the actual making the call. In fact, I’ve watched various programs, and I’ve read various articles where he was just doing his job. That was very normal.', 'You know, first everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong. After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job. So, and I do — and, by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he’s a fine man. Yes, john?', 'Reporter: What will you do on the leaks? You have said twice today [inaudible]', 'Trump: I’ve actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks. Those are criminal leaks.', 'They’re put out by people either in agencies you’ll see it stopping because now we have our people in. You know, again, we don’t have our people in because we can’t them approved by the Senate. We just had Jeff Sessions approved and just as an example. So, we are looking into that very seriously. It’s a criminal act.', 'You know what I say, when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked. Cause all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment.

Very important, very, you know, I mean, at the highest level, are you going to be reporting about that too?', 'So I don’t want classified information getting out to the public.

You’re the one that wrote about them and reported them. I mean the leaks are real. You know what they said. You saw it and the leaks are absolutely real.

Would you have fired him if that information hadn’t leaked out?', 'Trump: I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence. Very simple. Mike was doing his job. He was calling countries, his counterparts, so it certainly would have been okay with me if he did it. I would have directed him to do it if I thought he was not doing it. I did not direct him, but I would have directed him because that’s his job. It came out that way, and, in all fairness, I watched Dr. Charles Krauthammer the other night say, he was doing his job.

Porsche will acquire 12.5% of the Delaware-based holding company.', 'The move builds on an existing tie-up between the companies. In late 2020, Porsche announced a roughly $24 million investment in a pilot plant being produced by HIF in Chile. The plant is expected to begin production later this year of e-fuels, which are made from hydrogen and carbon dioxide.', '“Today is an important milestone in our commitment to e-fuels,” Barbara Frenkel, head of procurement for Porsche, said during a media roundtable from Chile. “We see our participation in HIF Global as a long-term investment and the use of e-fuels is, of course, of great interest to the automotive industry … it is also effective for aviation and shipping industries.”', 'Porsche’s new investment is part of a larger international financing round of $260 million, according to HIF.

53,How aluminum became a cash cow for Goldman,2014-06-03T17:42:51+0000,"[' A book hitting the stores Tuesday by CNBC’s Kate Kelly takes  a look inside the powerful group that runs the global commodities  trade. The following is an excerpt.', '  During the summer of 2011, officials at the London Metal Exchange  got an unexpected complaint from The  Coca-Cola Company. The amount of physical aluminum in storage  was piling up, said a representative of the soda maker, and,  along with it, so was the expense of buying the metal for  beverage containers.', '  The culprit, as Coke saw it, wasn’t simple supply and  demand—in fact, there was plenty of aluminum sitting in  warehouses. It was the shrewd tactics of Goldman Sachs, the bank that owned a network of  metal-storage facilities in the Detroit vicinity, where waiting  times for extracting aluminum were longer than ever. Every day  those metal bars sat idle, Goldman’s warehouse company  effectively drove up the premium amount that aluminum producers  could charge for delivering supplies to beverage-packaging  factories, a cost that amplified the expense of the actual metal  and, thus, the prices Coke and others paid for soda cans.', '  “The situation has been organized artificially to drive premiums  up,” said Dave Smith, Coke’s head of strategic procurement, at an  industry conference that June. “It takes two weeks to put  aluminum in, and six months to get it out.”', '  Coke wasn’t alone in its frustration. More than a year earlier,  eight players had complained privately to the LME, the obscure  London metals bourse that set the benchmark price for aluminum,  zinc, copper, and other important nonprecious, or base, metals  that were key in manufacturing. The U.S. warehousing system that  the exchange oversaw was so inefficient that it was hurting  corporate profits, they had argued.', '  The Midwest premium, the regional U.S. rate for getting metal  from a seller to a buyer, was a cost imposed on Coke and other  manufacturers in addition to the cash, or spot price of aluminum,  which was by then bouncing back from its lowest levels in some  time. Aluminum prices had increased 13 percent since the  beginning of 2010, when Goldman had paid half a billion dollars  to acquire Metro International Trade Services, the metal storage  business it now owned in Romulus, Michigan. Bought relatively  cheap at a time when commodity prices were low, Goldman took on  Metro as a way to broaden its suite of physical commodity  holdings, which had become an important complement to its  derivatives trading in London and the U.S. ', '  In addition to the revenue Metro offered, it presented Goldman  with the possibility of a free look at what was happening on the  physical side of commodities through ground-level operations.  Tweaking existing contract trades in a commodity based on  feedback from colleagues who worked in the physical markets was  by then commonplace in banking. “We had pipeline capacity all  over the place and we would call up and say, ‘How’s gas flowing  this morning?’” remembers a trading manager who worked for years  at one of Goldman’s competitors. If flows were weak, he added,  “We’d go, ‘Oh, we’re not going to get the pop we thought, so  let’s reposition.’ ” Still, Goldman spokespeople consistently  denied that employees familiar with Metro’s business operations  shared information about it with internal traders.', '  Goldman wasn’t the only one dipping into the physical commodity  world, a cornerstone of companies like Glencore International,  the Swiss trading firm originally known as Marc Rich & Co.,  that considered owning hard assets to be a critical aspect of  trading commodities. JPMorgan had recently bought a metal-storage  firm called Henry Bath & Son, among other physical assets.  Broadly speaking, the bet was that metal traders would stock up  on physical product while prices were relatively low and hold  their stocks until the market improved, generating steady rental  incomes for the warehouse owners in the process.', '  The new metal-warehouse owners quickly proved right—and had  huge stacks of metal bars to prove it. The nine hundred thousand  tons of aluminum Metro stored in its Detroit facilities when  Goldman bought it in 2010 were growing daily. Meanwhile,  incentive fees Metro paid to hedge funds, physical commodity  traders and other tenants—usually one or two hundred dollars  per ton each year—encouraged them to leave the metal there  for longer periods. ', '  For Goldman Sachs’s president, Gary Cohn, the aluminum  warehousing trade was a bit of déjà vu. Two decades  before, in the early 1990s, he had moved to London to help expand  Goldman’s commodities business, a onetime New Orleans coffee  trader that was known as J. Aron & Company. While in London,  Cohn stumbled upon a lucrative aluminum trade that involved  storing huge amounts of the metal until prices in the market  allowed him to sell at a profit.', '  Aluminum, which was a popular futures contract to trade, was at  the time in deep contango, a situation in which its future price  was far higher than its cash price. This meant that investors in  the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index — the commodities version  of the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, which had exposure  to aluminum and other major futures contracts—were  constantly paying extra money simply to maintain their aluminum  exposure as they replaced their existing near-term contracts with  new ones each month.', '  But every futures contract had an expiration date, and as that  date neared, its holder had a choice: either take physical delivery of  the aluminum, or roll the contract forward and replace it with a  similar futures contract dated farther out.', '  Cohn realized it would be cheaper to take delivery of the  aluminum than roll a futures contract forward. But doing so would  mean breaking a long-held tradition of leaving the logistics of  transporting bars of metal and barrels of oil to the  professionals who actually used them. Sourcing and shipping a  commodity like crude oil was elaborate enough that many futures  traders would never bother with it. And storing metal until  somebody else wanted to turn it into cans or cars was also a  highly nuanced endeavor with its own rulebook.', '  Cohn dove into the world of metal storage and financing, visiting  warehouses and researching metal insurance. “I spent a month sort  of due-diligencing a trade that took me thirty seconds to figure  out,” he says.', '  Convinced of the potential profits, he took the idea to one of J.  Aron’s senior managers, Lloyd Blankfein. Blankfein, a former gold  salesman, was dubious.', '  Cohn was insistent. He had thought through every issue, he told  Blankfein, and this was a “riskless” opportunity. Cohn would  hedge every potential problem he could find—interest rate  movements, currency movements, anything that could hurt the  trade’s performance—and would definitely make money.  Blankfein told him to run an experiment using no more than $300  million, a substantial portion of the firm’s $4 billion in  capital during that period.', '  The following Monday, Cohn bought $100 million worth of physical  aluminum—about a hundred thousand tons. Even with all the  homework he had done, and despite his boasts to Blankfein, he  honestly expected the potential profits to vanish as a result of  a sudden physical price drop, a surprise hike in storage fees, or  some other unforeseen complication. But the following day,  nothing had changed much, so he bought another $100 million of the metal. The next day, he bought another $50 million. By Friday,  when the spread, or difference between what he would have spent  to roll the contract forward and what he was actually spending to  store the metal, was still intact, he knew he was on to something.', '  Cohn continued taking physical delivery of aluminum, stockpiling  it in storage facilities in the Dutch city of Rotterdam. He also  began calling the firm’s aluminum-producer clients, seeing if  they wanted to sell down their physical inventories; many were  happy to oblige. Goldman Sachs was relieving them of excess metal  and helping them to free up cash without tipping off the rest of  the market. Meanwhile, its physical aluminum holdings offset the  futures it sold in the markets, giving Goldman what amounted to a  neutral position.', '  For more than two years, Goldman built enormous caches of  aluminum. Its hoard helped prompt the biggest aluminum price  rally the market had seen since 1988. During the years when Cohn  was purchasing the commodity, physical market prices nearly  doubled—amplifying the value of J. Aron’s stockpiles and  creating over half a billion dollars in profit to Goldman over  several years.', '  Late in 1994, a few months after his thirty-fourth birthday, Cohn  made partner, joining the ruling 2 percent echelon of a  9,600-employee firm. Around the same time, he also received a  strange complaint: the metal masses in Rotterdam had grown so  extensive that their reflection of the sun was creating confusion  for local air-traffic controllers. Airport officials asked  Goldman if it could throw a tarp over its aluminum stash to make  navigating the local skies a little easier.', '  By 2010 Metro, the metal-storage business Goldman had bought, was  storing one to two million tons of aluminum, zinc, and lead in  its Detroit corridor, and had leases with about two dozen  clients. But, thanks to the restrictive LME rules and the  market’s growing penchant for storing metal stocks, Metro’s  rental fees—about 40 cents per metric ton per day—were  generating more than $100 million in revenue each year.', '  When Coke, a longtime investment-banking client that had recently  hired Goldman to advise it on a $12 billion acquisition,  initially complained about the escalating storage costs of  aluminum and slow delivery times, the firm tried to assuage its  concerns. The trouble was the LME system, Goldman argued, which  was inefficient and needed updating. Goldman itself was simply  following the rules.', '  Truthfully, shipping out even the required amount of aluminum per  day was a huge undertaking. One day in September 2012, a few  months after the LME had raised minimum removal mandates, the  eighteen Metro workers in the company’s Chesterfield, Mich. plant  were very busy. Train boxcars sat with their doors open on the  tracks that ran inside the building as workers loaded slabs of  metal into them. Because the aluminum was so heavy, the stacks in  each car were surprisingly low, filling up only a fraction of the  space. Beeping forklifts breezed by as drivers picked up the bars  specified by individual warrants, or certificates of ownership,  for metal holders who wanted their wares transferred.', '  Rental fees had risen by that point to about 45 cents per ton per  day, generating some $200 million per year in revenue on Detroit  aluminum stores alone. Nonetheless, the premiums at work in the  Midwest market made the ownership lucrative, explained a Metro  executive, especially when aluminum markets were in contango.', '  “The ownership of metal is a control game,” he said, adding that  the markets were easy to squeeze because there were so few units  in circulation. Metro’s typical customer was a hedge fund, the  executive said, that bought physical aluminum from a producer  like Alcoa, shorted it through the futures markets as it was  being shipped to the warehouse, and then took ownership of the  warrants on the aluminum once they arrived in Detroit. Then the  aluminum-owning hedge fund could sell its warrant to another  party, who might wait for aluminum spot prices to rise, locking  in a profit.', '  The LME’s increased removal rate had done little to assuage Coke  and other aluminum users. Premiums had gone from about 6.5 cents  in 2010 to 11 cents by then, and would rise to a record of nearly  12 cents by the summer of 2013.', '  As the premium prices rose, Goldman and the LME were sued for  violating U.S. antitrust laws in the Detroit warehouses. A  parallel Justice Department inquiry was soon under way.', ' Excerpted from “The Secret Club That Runs the World: Inside  the Fraternity of Commodity Traders,” to be published in June  2014 by Portfolio, a member of Penguin Group (USA) LLC.

But last week, the ruling coalition party began talks with opposition groups with a view to amending an anti-terror law critics say stymies dissent.', 'Meanwhile, the country’s telecoms sector, a state-run monopoly, said it would allow local firms to use its infrastructure to provide internet services.', 'On top of this, the Financial Times reported that major investor China has cut back its financial ties to Ethiopia, citing concerns over foreign exchange shortages and national debt.', '“Caution is still required as Ethiopia is coming back from the brink,” Pat Thaker, editorial director for the Middle East and Africa at the Economist Intelligence Unit, told CNBC via email Monday.', 'But, with Chinese investment potentially becoming less of a presence in Ethiopia, “this presents an opening for Western investors who have generally stayed back in the last two to three years, and I think the political news will complement that.”', 'Ethiopia imposed a state of emergency in February following the resignation of Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn.', 'Longstanding tension had bubbled up between ethnic groups in the country, and the new restrictions were intended to quell civil unrest by, for example, prohibiting the distribution of politically sensitive material or unauthorized demonstrations.', 'Current Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed assumed office in April. The lifting of the state of emergency is a “welcome sign that the new prime minister is listening to international, as well as domestic, concerns over opening the political space,” Devlin told CNBC via email.', 'The country, known for its exports of coffee and other agricultural products, has seen foreign direct investment grow to over $3 billion in 2015/16.

57,Young Greek entrepreneurs: ‘We are unfazed’,2015-12-10T15:06:13+0000,"['  ATHENS — In a modern high-tech office, two software engineers are  busy directing an army of young engineers as they work on  upgrades for their three-year-old cloud-based recruiting software  company, Workable.com, which already has 3,500 customers in 50  countries and has attracted more than $34 million in venture  capital. ', '  It would be just another Silicon Valley success story if it  weren’t for the company’s home base: Greece, a country that is the basket case in the euro zone because of economic mismanagement,  public sector corruption and a youth unemployment rate that’s a  staggering 60 percent. The situation is so dire, suicide  rates are on the rise, and there is an exodus of talent looking  for opportunities abroad.', 'Despite the bleak outlook, there is a growing cadre of Greek  entrepreneurs determined to defy the odds and build high-tech  businesses that can thrive, providing a glimmer of hope for the  economy. These trailblazers are patriots. As the most highly  educated generation in the nation’s history, they are determined  to grow their ideas on home soil even as Greece grapples with  budget austerity, and regulatory changes that are undermining the  middle class and threatening national sovereignty.', '“The crisis has pushed people into survival mode, and they  are looking for opportunities,” according to Stavros Messinis,  CEO and founder of The Cube, a start-up incubator in  Athens. “At this point, there isn’t much for them to lose.”', '  Most are tired of an unstable political system unable to put the  country back on its feet. Since the start of the economic crisis  in 2009, Greece has lost more than 25 percent of its GDP, and  thousands of enterprises have gone bust under the pressure of a  deepening recession. This summer the country defaulted on more than $280 billion of debt, and capital controls were issued to prevent  a run on the banks. ', '  As Messinis explained, “Up until now, 70 percent of Greeks were  employed by the public sector. But that is now crumbling.  Now we need to develop a high-tech  sector that can produce value-added products and services to turn the economy around.”', '  Perhaps nowhere in the Western World are the obstacles for  entrepreneurs so difficult and complex. The lack of bank  liquidity makes it near impossible to raise bank loans. The  antiquated legal system mires new businesses in red tape. There  are 39 procedures just to register a new business entity, get  electricity turned on and get construction permits. Taxes —  including a 100 percent advanced corporate income rate — are also  onerous, while the social benefits of costs for new hires, including pension and health care, is 39  percent annually. ', 'Yet some Greek entrepreneurs are willing to deal  with the realities of a broken bureaucratic system and a sinking  public sector in order to remain in their home country. For them,  the risks are worth it, since there are few avenues left that  offer career opportunities.', '  “We are unfazed by the Greek economic crisis,” said Nikos  Moraitakis, co-founder and CEO of Workable.com. “We are building a  global high-tech business that can take root anywhere, with a  customer base that is 98 percent outside Greece in more than 50  countries. In fact, we feel we have a leg up because we can  recruit excellent engineers at very competitive costs who are  fiercely loyal employees.”', '  All of Workable.com’s engineers have at least a master’s degree from top-flight U.S. and European universities, such as Purdue University and Imperial College in London, speak  English and many other languages and are up to date on all  technical advances. Their annual salary ranges from $50,000 to  $80,000 vs. $100,000 to $150,000 in the U.S.', '  It’s not surprising that Workable.com has become the poster child  of entrepreneurial success in Greece. The company — tapping  into the $1.7 billion market for small- and medium-sized  enterprises (SMEs) — is growing at 15 percent a month and  expects to expand its workforce from 60 to 200 employees by the  end of 2016. With well-heeled backers, including 83North  (formerly Greylock IL), Balderton Capital and Openfund, young  entrepreneurs aspire to copy the company’s success formula.', '  The model is to develop a tech product or service with huge  potential for the global market, keep R&D in Greece, and  maintain financial and marketing operations in the U.S., U.K. or  other European hub, said George Tziralis, managing partner of  Openfund, a €15 million Athens-based venture fund that provided  the seed funds for the software company and was the first  venture capital fund launched in Greece in 2009. “It’s a way to  circumvent political uncertainty and economic instability. It is  the new modus operandi,” explained Tziralis, a software engineer turned  entrepreneur himself.', '  At Endeavor Greece, a start-up accelerator in the tony  Kolonaki area of Athens, managing director Haris Makryniotis sees  the same trend. “Entrepreneurs of all ages are launching  businesses in the midst of an economic crisis, and an  entrepreneurial ecosystem is slowly developing here. ... When  economies go down, risk-taking by entrepreneurs goes up.”', '  According to Endeavor statistics, there are about 600 high-tech start-ups  in Greece that have sprung up in a range of industries, from  aerospace and biotech to tourism and mobile apps. Surprisingly,  the rate of formation has not declined through the country’s debt  crisis. It has actually increased 12 times since  2010. ', '  One of the early champions of this movement is Tziralis, who  didn’t only launch the country’s first VC fund but also Greece’s  first high-tech entrepreneurial networking forum, called Open  Coffee, in 2007. Today, hundreds attend Open Coffee’s monthly  events at the Binaki Museum in Athens and in other cities across  Greece, where successful entrepreneurs give presentations about  their best practices. It’s become the epicenter of the Greek  start-up scene, where developers, investors, geeks and marketers  gather to network and share ideas.', '  To date, Openfund has invested in 20 companies, including  Workable.com and Taxibeat — a hail-a-cab smartphone app and  taxi driver marketplace that has raised $6.7 million from  international investors and has been expanding its services  across cities in Europe and Latin America. ', '“These success stories are helping to boost interest from angels  and institutional investors from abroad,” Tziralis said. “They  are now realizing that a €1 investment in a Greek start-up is  equal to a £2 investment in the U.K. and a $5 investment in Silicon Valley because of our world-class  engineers.”', '  Following his lead, there are now a handful of venture capital  funds in Greece, including Attica Ventures, First Athens, PJ Tech  Catalyst, Jeremie Funds and Odyssey Venture Partners, managing about €70 million in assets. While this is a paltry  sum by international standards — the total European market for venture capital raised €4 billion last year — it’s helping to ignite a fledgling venture capital financing market. ', '  Multinationals like Microsoft are evangelizing the benefits of  high-impact entrepreneurship in Greece. Innovation centers,  business incubators and shared work spaces have sprung up across  Athens and other Greek cities to help start-ups. Their goal: to  help defray operating costs and mentor entrepreneurs. Their  mantra: Forget about any government support, since there isn’t  any. Instead, rely on your own resources and strength.', '  At the Microsoft Innovation Center, located on Kifissias Ave. in  Maroussi — a telecom alley located outside Athens —  entrepreneurs with sound commercial ideas in software and mobile  applications are given six months to two years to launch a  start-up with Microsoft product support. “To find candidates, we  visit universities and incubators,” said Fotis Draganidis, the  general manager of the center.', '  That is becoming easier as the number of incubators proliferate.  One called Orange Grove is sponsored by the Dutch embassy, and  Dutch companies such as Heineken, KLM and Philips. Another, called Enter Grow Go  (EGG) — backed by Eurobank, the third-largest Greek lender; and Corallia, a Greek innovation cluster — is  nurturing start-ups in a host of industries. The list includes  TomoTECH, a company developing advanced cloud-based brain MRI  software that is now raising $200,000 in a seed capital round  from angel investors in the U.K. and Greece to ramp up R&D  and expand its team. ', 'Although these incubators do not offer equity capital, they  sponsor competitions to help aspiring entrepreneurs garner grants  to transform their ideas into commercial prototypes and fledgling  businesses. At Orange Grove, a quarterly event called The Squeeze  awards eight of the most promising start-ups €10,000 to €15,000 so they can work full-time on their venture.', '  Often the publicity that winners attract can lead to big and better  things. Roxane Koutsolouka, the 29-year-old founder of JoinCargo,  an online transport platform connecting small businesses with  cargo carriers, was able to attract €100,000 from an angel  investor in the U.K. after winning first place at The Squeeze  last year. The networking event attracted more than 300 investors,  entrepreneurs and international company representatives who come  to offer support services for Greek start-ups.', '  One of the most notable competitions is the Hellenic Entrepreneurship Award, which is sponsored by the  Libra Group, an international conglomerate born out of the Greek  shipping empire of the Logothetis family. Each year, a panel of  judges composed of VCs, CEOs, bankers and marketing experts  choose up to five winners based on their disruptive innovation,  job creation potential and savvy financial and management  strategy. They are given interest-free loans of up to €1 million  to help with business plan development and branding. They also  receive a marketing mentorship from a Libra executive and free  legal, accounting and IT support.', '  According to Jimmy Athanasopoulos, head of social responsibility  for the Libra Group, submissions for the award have risen from  500 in 2012 to 900 in 2015. The quality of the business plans are  also improving every year as aspiring entrepreneurs become more  trained on how to structure business plans and develop business  strategy. “The start-up community is evolving, and we are in the  early days. It takes time, but we are getting there despite all  the hurdles,” said Athanasopoulos.', '  RTSafe, a winner of a €250,000 Hellenic Entrepreneurship  Award last year, found that the coveted prize has helped them  gain international recognition and the working capital to refine  their breakthrough medical technology. The one-year-old company  makes a 3-D-printed brain and skull avatar to improve the  targeting of radiotherapy for brain cancer patients that is now  being used at clinics, hospitals and research centers in the U.S.  and Europe. These include The University of Texas Health Science Center, San  Antonio, and Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in  Philadelphia. Among its customers are Brainlab and Philips. ', '  In June it also won the MIT Enterprise Forum Greece competition and now it  is being courted by venture capitalists and angel investors who  are attracted to the mulit-billion-dollar global market for the  company’s unique technology. “Besides the money and recognition,  Libra and MIT helped us bundle a strong management team and  develop a branding and marketing strategy that laid the  foundation for our venture,” said Evangelos Pappas, a medical  physicist who is one of RTSafe’s co-founders. The company has a  pre-valuation of €12 million and it is being courted by  angel and VC investors in Europe and Boston.', '  Guidance is pivotal, since most Greek entrepreneurs are  scientists and technology geeks that lack strong business  management experience. “It is a weakness in the market,” stressed  Ion Tsakonas, CEO of PJ Tech Catalyst, a €15 million seed-stage venture capital fund that invests in information and communication technology companies (ICTs) and is backed by Piraeus Bank. “Teams are not experienced enough in  business building,” Tsakonas said. “We are seeing an organized effort now in  Greece to educate and train entrepreneurs. The question now is  how quickly all of this will trickle down.”', '  Philipp Brinkmann, the Greek founder of Travelplanet24.com, the largest  e-commerce company in Greece, sees a dramatic improvement in the  entrepreneurial talent base over the last three years. “When I  first launched my online travel booking company in 2004, it was hard to find  people with experience in online marketing and data science,” he  said. “Now there is quite a lot of talent in Greece. And we’re seeing more start-ups take off.”', '  “What the country needs is more access to capital, and a larger  venture capital industry base,” Brinkmann said, noting he had to  bootstrap his company and plow profits back into the business in  order to grow, since no other funding options were available. “If  I had access to capital, there is no telling how much faster I  could have grown my venture.” ', 'Today, Travelplanet24 employs 270  people and has annual revenues of €520 million. After  acquiring its biggest competitor, Airtickets.com, earlier this  year, it now serves 40 markets worldwide and garners 67 percent of  its revenue from Europe. ', '  Greece also needs to build bridges between the university  research community, corporations, entrepreneurial innovators and  investors, much like the collaborative infrastructure in Silicon  Valley. ', '  An early visionary who has been laying the foundation for change  is Vassilios Makios, professor emeritus of engineering at the  University of Patras and general director of the Corallia Clusters Initiative. In the late 1990s, he  realized the need for Greece to transform its public sector  economy into one focused on ICT value-added products and  services, much like Israel had done in the 1970s. “I saw how a  lack of private innovation was forcing brilliant young minds to  leave Greece to find jobs elsewhere. “It was a brain drain  threatening our country’s future,” he said.', '  So he reached out to companies like Atmel, a Silicon Valley firm  that makes flash memory chips and which is run by Greek expats,  to establish a product design center in the Greek city of Patras.  After successfully luring a handful of other high-tech  multinationals, he joined forces with two other Greeks who had  worked at Bell Labs, and the team was able to get a grant from  the EU to launch Corallia in 2008. It is the country’s first  innovation design cluster that focuses on supporting new ventures  in the microelectronics, nanotechnology, gaming and aerospace  industries and boosting cooperative research efforts among  companies of all sizes in these fields. ', '  Today, Corallia has 150 company members, of which 40 are  start-ups. The innovation cluster idea pioneered by U.S. start-up  guru Michael Porter of Harvard Business School has helped Greek  companies boost exports by 108 percent and churn out 100 patents  over the last five years. Corallia has been recognized by the EU  for excellence and is now part of the Silicon Europe Alliance.', '  “For the last 30 years, entrepreneurship was an anathema in  Greece, but that’s slowly changing,” Makios said. “We can now  support multinationals that need R&D but face talent  shortages in places like Israel and India.” ', '  The start-up supply chain is emerging in this economically  battered country. Across Greece, universities are teaching  students how to think like entrepreneurs and transform innovative  ideas into breakthrough commercial products. They are also  pairing engineering students with MBAs to forge teams capable of  developing sound business strategies to boost the odds of  start-up success.', '  At the University of Economics and Business in Athens,  Ennovation, the country’s biggest student entrepreneurial  competition, is held during Global Entrepreneurship Week in  November. At the event, around 300 teams from more than 40  universities in Greece and Cyprus pitch their big ideas, vying  for a chance to land a spot at a local incubator like the EGG,  set up residence at the Microsoft Innovation Center or get  invited to meet potential investors abroad. ', '  For a lucky few, Ennovation has been their “Golden Ticket.” Just  ask TomoTECH’s CEO Zoi Giavri. The electrical engineer won last  year and was taken to the South by Southwest Conference in  Austin, Texas, this past March, where she met potential investors  and gained perspective about the entrepreneurial mentality in the  U.S. ', '  “It’s a dream come true and a chance for a brighter future,” she  said.']"

While  basic income is still an emerging idea, one far from being  deployed on a large scale, the growing experimentation  underscores the deep need to find effective means to alleviate  the perils of globalization.', '  The search has gained an extraordinary sense of urgency as a wave  of reactionary populism sweeps the globe, casting the elite  establishment as the main beneficiary of economic forces that  have hurt the working masses. Americans’ election of Donald J.  Trump, who has vowed to radically constrain trade, and the  stunning vote in Britain to abandon the European Union, have  resounded as emergency sirens for global leaders. They must  either update capitalism to share the spoils more equitably, or  risk watching angry mobs dismantle the institutions that have  underpinned economic policy since the end of World War II.', '  Universal basic income is a catchall phrase that describes a  range of proposals, but they generally share one feature: All  people in society get a regular check from the government —  regardless of their income or whether they work. These funds are  supposed to guarantee food and shelter, enabling people to pursue  their own betterment while contributing to society.', '  A Silicon Valley start-up incubator, Y Combinator, is preparing a  pilot project in Oakland, Calif., in which 100 families will  receive unconditional cash grants ranging from $1,000 to $2,000 a  month. Voters in Switzerland recently rejected a basic-income  scheme, but the French Senate approved a trial. Experiments are  being readied in Canada and the Netherlands. The Indian  government has been studying basic income as a means of  alleviating poverty.', '  “The last two years, there’s been an explosion of interest in  basic income,” says Guy Standing, a research associate with the  School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of  London, and a co-founder of the Basic Income Earth Network, an  institution created to promote the idea. “The elites realize that  the inequalities are becoming politically dangerous.”', '  For generations, policy makers have sought the magic formula for  so-called full employment, with nearly everyone who wants a job  able to find one. Traditional unemployment insurance schemes were  devised in an age when the cyclical nature of factory life was  dominant. Workers who were idled in lean times could pay their  bills using unemployment benefits while awaiting the inevitable  return of flush ones.', '  Universal basic income is gaining consideration in part as an  acknowledgment that the labor market has changed so fundamentally  that full employment may amount to a fantasy. Factories have been  refashioned into urban-chic office spaces. Robots are replacing  workers, while the gig economy turns full-time jobs into contract  positions.', '  Basic income is intended to be permanent, built for an age in  which demand for labor may be perpetually slack. Whatever happens  — say everyone becomes a part-time Uber driver, or Uber  drivers are replaced by self-driving cars — everyone can  count on sustenance.', '  Strikingly, basic income is being championed across the  ideological spectrum.', '  Utopian dreamers envision it as an emancipation from the  meaninglessness of low-wage work. People stuck in dead-end jobs  at fast-food restaurants could abandon laboring over the  fryolator in favor of growing organic vegetables and reading to  their children.', '  Labor advocates embrace basic income as a means of increasing  bargaining power, enabling workers to eschew poverty-level wages  while holding out for better.', '  Libertarians see it as a means of shrinking government by  consolidating social service programs. Liberals envision it as a  way to remove the stigma of public assistance: Instead of  standing in line at the grocery store bearing food stamps while  suffering the judgment of other shoppers — Shouldn’t she be  buying spinach instead of frozen pizza? — poor people would  get the same check as everyone else.', '  The technology world has seized on basic income as the response  to automation and its threat of joblessness. If everyone’s needs  are being met, then society can embrace robots and liberation  from drudge work.', '  Yet the expensive price tag attached to anything that is truly  universal makes it a political nonstarter in many countries  — especially in the United States, where Mr. Trump just  appointed a labor secretary who is critical of simply raising the  minimum wage.', '  If every American were to receive just $10,000 a year, the tab  would be roughly $3 trillion a year, roughly eight times what the  United States now spends on social service programs. The  government might just as well commit to handing out unicorns.', '  Beyond arithmetic, basic income confronts fundamental  disagreements about human reality. If people are released from  fears that — absent work — they risk finding themselves  sleeping outdoors, will they devolve into freeloaders?', '  “Some people think basic income will solve every problem under  the sun, and some people think it’s from the hand of Satan and  will destroy our work ethic,” says Olli Kangas, who oversees  research at Kela, a Finnish government agency that administers  many social welfare programs. “I’m hoping we can create some  knowledge on this issue.”', '  Half a millennium ago, Thomas More’s seminal novel, “Utopia,”  included the suggestion that public assistance might be a better  way to deter thieves than a death sentence. More than two  centuries later, the American revolutionary agitator Thomas Paine  proposed creating a national pool of money distributed to every  adult.', '  The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. promoted basic income. The  libertarian economist Milton Friedman embraced a variant:  negative income taxes that would put cash in the pockets of the  poor.', '  Yet with the exception of a few experiments, basic income has  been confined to the margins of policy conversations.', '  Until now.', '  Finland’s concerns are pragmatic. The government has no interest  in freeing wage earners to write poetry. It is eager to generate  more jobs.', '  The global financial crisis and its aftermath played out against  a wrenching economic refashioning here. The growth of tablets and  smartphones assailed a major industry, commercial paper  manufacturing. A crisis in neighboring Russia diminished trade.  Over the last decade, Finland’s economy has grown not at all.', '  For workers, the shock has been cushioned by a comprehensive  social welfare system. In the five years after suffering a job  loss, a Finnish family of four that is eligible for housing  assistance receives average benefits equal to 73 percent of  previous wages, according to data from the Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development. That is nearly triple the  level in the United States.', '  But the social safety net also appears to be impeding the  reinvigoration of the economy by discouraging unemployed people  from working part time.', '  “It always should be worth taking the job rather than staying  home and taking the benefits,” says Finland’s minister for social  affairs and health, Pirkko Mattila. “We have to take the risk to  do this experiment.”', '  Oulu, a city of nearly 200,000 people on the Nordic Sea, stands  as a potentially fertile testing ground.', '  In centuries past, inhabitants occupied themselves shipping  salmon and tar upriver to Russia while trying not to freeze to  death. More recently, the city has evolved into a center for  wireless communications.', '  Three years ago, Microsoft purchased Nokia’s handset business,  raising local hopes of a revival. But last year, Microsoft went  on to shutter the operation. Local Nokia jobs have been halved,  falling to 2,500 from 5,000. Oulu’s unemployment rate now sits  above 16 percent, more than double the national average.', '  City leaders portray this as an opportunity to start over,  describing a future centered on companies like Asmo Solutions.', '  With its office in a first-story walk-up, the company checks the  boxes for requisite elements of a modern start-up. Coders stare  into laptops while leaning against beanbag chairs arrayed across  red shag carpeting. The founder, Asmo Saloranta, 35, wears a  silver hoop earring, his blond hair pulled back into a ponytail.  He used to be chief executive; now he is chief visionary. He has  designed a phone charger that draws power only when a phone is  connected.', '  Oulu is an ideal place to start a technology business, he says:  “There are highly talented tech people.”', '  But hiring them is maddeningly complicated.', '  Mr. Saloranta has his eyes on a former Nokia employee who is  masterly at developing prototypes. He only needs him part time.  He could pay 2,000 euros a month (about $2,090). Yet this  potential hire is bringing home more than that via his  unemployment benefits.', '  “It’s more profitable for him to just wait at home for some ideal  job,” Mr. Saloranta complains.', '  Basic income would fix this, he says: “It would activate many  more unemployed people.”', '  This is a part of the debate that often gets missed. Monthly  checks for everyone may look like socialism, but proponents  advance it as a way to invigorate capitalism.', '  From Italy to India, companies that would like to leave behind  unprofitable enterprises in favor of fresh pursuits hold back  because of the expense and reputational damage of firing people.  Basic income could be the tool that makes restructuring  palatable.', '  With basic income in place, companies might be more inclined to  take a risk on hiring more aggressively — adding vigor to  the local economy — knowing they have the freedom to be  ruthless in cutting loose those workers who prove disappointing.', '  “It does make it easier to have labor flexibility,” says Karl  Widerquist, a philosopher at Georgetown University in Qatar, and  a leading advocate for basic income. “I know that if I have to  close down this operation, everyone is going to be O.K.”', '  People who lose jobs would do well to gain training in modern  trades. On this point, economists universally concur. Yet in many  countries, social welfare systems are so laden with rules that  jobless people tend to acquire just one skill: They gain savvy in  navigating the bureaucracy.', '  This dependency is a key justification for basic income. If  people receive money without having to endure appointments with  government bureaucrats, they will have time for more productive  exploits.', '  “Basic income is kind of a symbol that we believe in your  capacity and we think that you are actually able to do things  which are beneficial to you, and also for your community,” says  Heikki Hiilamo, a professor of social policy at Helsinki  University. “It’s built on a kind of a positive view of human  beings. People want to be autonomous. They want to improve their  well-being.”', '  Jaana Matila has three degrees in computing and an obsessive  interest in software, and intense aspirations to forge a career  in the Oulu technology scene.', '  What she does not have — has never had — is a full-time  job.', '  At 29, she has completed three unpaid internships. Her last stint  ended when her employer folded.', '  She teaches adults to swim. She catches freelance jobs, recently  designing a website for a hair salon. Mostly, she lives on  unemployment benefits — 700 euros a month (about $732).', '  Ms. Matila would like to do more freelance work, but she lives in  fear of derailing her unemployment benefits. She is supposed to  fill out forms that account for every bit of income while  providing pay stubs, bank documents and work contracts. Earlier  this year, she failed to secure a receipt for the swim lessons.  While she tracked one down, she lost her benefits for a month.', '  “I had to ask my boyfriend, ‘Can you give me some monthly money  so I can buy some food?’” she says. “It’s really frustrating.”', '  She thinks about starting a website. Mostly, though, she goes for  walks through the forest with her dog. She frets that she is  falling behind in skills as technology advances.', '  “People in a disadvantaged position, they use a major part of  their cognitive ability worrying about their lives, worrying  about where they will get their next meal,” says Mikko Annala, a  researcher at Demos Helsinki, a think tank. “What if we have this  potential there that is continuously worrying about life, about  making it? What if we can get that into use by giving them  something? That is a hypothesis that we should absolutely test.”', '  The most compelling argument against basic income is the most  obvious: If everyone gets money without a requirement to do  anything, humans may become morally depraved slackers.', '  Jari Viljala finds this notion ridiculous.', '  An electrician by trade, Mr. Viljala is accustomed to braving  Arctic blasts of wind in minus-35-degree temperatures while  threading wires into the spines of new housing complexes. He has  left his wife and two daughters behind for as long as eight  months at a time to venture north for construction projects.', '  His gaze intense, his arms covered in tattoos, he takes pride in  his reputation as the guy who will do anything.', '  “The dirtiest, trickiest job that no one else wanted to do,” he  says, “I have always volunteered.”', '  But since the summer, Mr. Viljala has been out of work. His 3,300  euros in monthly wages (about $3,450) have given way to 650 euros  (about $680) in monthly unemployment benefits.', '  He needs money for new brakes on his 11-year-old Ford sedan,  which failed inspection. Without a car, he cannot get to what  work he may secure. He also needs money to get current on the  rent, having fallen more than two months behind.', '  At 36, he is wiry and strong. He could earn additional cash on  the side. But the unemployment rules say otherwise.', '  So he stays home and does what he can — making dinner for  his girls, doing the laundry. He rides the bus through the gray  dawn to the unemployment office.', '  He waits and he worries. He wonders how it makes any sense that  an able-bodied man with every compulsion to work must stay idle  to ensure that he can support his family.']"
