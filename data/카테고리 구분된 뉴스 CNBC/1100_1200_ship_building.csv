', 'Over the next 30 years, investing $2 trillion to $3.7 trillion globally across several sustainable ocean-based policy interventions would generate a net benefit of $8.2 trillion to $22.8 trillion, according to the report commissioned by the High Level Panel for Sustainable Ocean Economy, a project of 14 world leaders and the United Nations secretary-general’s special envoy for the ocean.', 'The research focuses on investments in four main areas: increasing the production of sustainable protein from the ocean, maintaining mangrove habitats, increasing offshore wind production and decarbonizing international shipping. ', '“When we think about the ocean, we think about the impact of climate change on ecosystems and marine habitats. We think about overfishing [and] ocean pollution,” said Manaswita Konar, lead ocean economist in WRI’s Sustainable Ocean Initiative and a co-author of the report. ', '“But we rarely think about the ocean’s ability to address these challenges and bring about prosperity to the economy,” she said. ', 'Ocean-related industries like offshore wind energy, fishing and shipping comprise roughly 3.5% to 7% of global gross domestic product, a value expected to double by 2030, according to estimates from the WRI. However, the coronavirus pandemic has severely impacted jobs and output from those sectors, and climate change, overfishing and pollution are destroying the ocean’s ability to sustain those sectors.', '“We need to stop thinking about the ocean as just a victim of climate change and start talking more about how ocean-based solutions can help achieve economic recovery post-Covid and build economic resilience into the system,” Konar said. ', 'One solution researchers suggest is investing in ocean-based food production by improving fisheries and the production of ocean aquaculture. ', 'As the global population grows, investing in wild fisheries would help provide healthy diets for people over the next 30 years while replacing carbon emission-intensive land-based proteins like beef and lamb, researchers contended. Every $1 invested in increasing production of sustainably sourced ocean-based protein is estimated to generate $10 in benefits, the report said. ', 'Another solution is investing in mangroves, which are swamp ecosystems typically located in the tropics that connect freshwater and oceanic ecosystems and protect people from sea level rise, hurricanes and flooding. Every $1 invested in mangrove conservation and restoration is estimated to yield a benefit of $3, according to the report. ', '“It is important to protect mangroves as early as possible — early investment is important — to avoid high costs in the future,” said Helen Ding, an environmental economist at the WRI’s Economics Center and a co-author of the report. ', 'Offshore wind farms, which are continuing to expand across the world, are part of a major push to get electricity primarily from renewable sources.', 'While offshore farms generally cost a lot more than power from turbines on land, excitement over offshore wind projects has grown amid climate change fears and advancements in technology have helped lower costs. ', 'Researchers contend that every $1 invested in scaling up global offshore wind production generates a benefit estimated at $2 to $17, depending on the varying cost of production. But the value of the return on investment will likely increase as costs for offshore wind energy generate fall due to improved technology. ', 'Another challenge in the energy sector is international shipping, a major carbon dioxide emitter. The industry accounts for roughly 2.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and the total cost to decarbonize the sector has been estimated at $1.65 trillion by 2050.', 'Researchers say that every $1 invested in decarbonizing global shipping and reducing carbon emissions to net zero is estimated to generate a return of $2 to $5.', '“The returns are going to be significant in terms of the health benefits we’ll get from reducing greenhouse gases,” Konar said of decarbonzing the shipping industry. “These benefits will prolong beyond 2050.” ', 'Across all the investment areas, researchers estimated the value of benefits with assessments like health, environmental and ecological, water usage and economic and social factors. The categories of costs included assessments like costs to businesses, government and households. ', '“We are going through a financial crisis post-Covid, so there will be questions raised about the financial implications of these investments,” Konar said.', '“But we have sustainable development goals and commitments that we need to achieve, and all these interventions will help us achieve those,” she added. “We are preparing for challenges that the world will face in the future.” ']"
1,Here’s what investors should know about rocket builder Astra as it prepares to go public,2021-02-23T20:44:00+0000,"['Rocket builder Astra is preparing to go public in the second quarter, taking on a crowded field of competitors while aiming for daily deliveries to space by 2025.', 'CEO Chris Kemp spoke to CNBC this month about the company’s plans for its upcoming cash infusion.', 'Once Astra closes its merger with Holicity, a special purpose acquisition company, the venture expects it will have as much as $500 million in capital on hand.', 'That includes a $30 million funding round, previously unreported by media, that the rocket builder closed prior to announcing its SPAC deal.', 'Astra, based in Alameda, California, raised the smaller round to help it “go faster” while the merger awaits regulatory approval, with Holicity’s sponsor Pendrell Corporation and existing investors such as Marc Benioff contributing.', '“We’re actually building a space platform – in much the same way that when Amazon started, they weren’t marketing themselves as a delivery truck company or a warehouse company,” Kemp said. “We’re really trying to solve the problem that our customers have, which is they want to put stuff in space quickly.”', 'Financial backing aside, Astra is entering a field packed with competitors.', 'For starters, its 40-foot-tall rocket puts it in the sub-sector of small launch vehicles – a category of the space industry that analysts and executives estimate has in excess of 100 startups in various stages of development. All those ventures are looking to compete with the small rocket leader Rocket Lab.', 'Astra’s rocket is advertised as capable of carrying up to 100 kilograms to low Earth orbit, for as little as $2.5 million for a dedicated launch. Kemp expects that price point to drop as Astra accelerates to a weekly launch rate in 2023 and beyond.', '“The plan is fully funded to 2025 to get to daily space delivery,” he said.', 'It’s a formidable goal. “You’re talking about nearly a launch a day,” said Ken Herbert, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity.', '“Is it possible theoretically? Yes. But, in basically four years, is one company going to be able to support that kind of schedule? It’s ambitious – nobody’s ever done it.”', '“It doesn’t mean it’s impossible, but everything’s got to go right, even COVID-19 aside,” said Herbert. “And there are other factors in play – if you have an anomaly with any one of these launches than everything else is going to get [delayed]”', 'Astra became the latest private rocket builder to reach space for the first time in December, after its Rocket 3.2 vehicle launched from Alaska.', 'Although the rocket did not reach orbit on that mission, Astra’s leadership viewed the launch as clearing the final hurdles needed to begin commercial service later this year.', 'Astra’s board of directors includes Kemp, co-founder and chief technology officer Dr. Adam London, Advance executive Nomi Bergman and ACME venture capital partner Scott Stanford.', 'Holicity chairman and CEO Craig McCaw is expected to join the board when the merge is complete.', 'The SPAC merger values the rocket company at a $2.1 billion enterprise value. It will list on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ASTR when the deal closes.', 'Shares of Holicity have climbed since the deal was announced on Feb. 2, up about 50% since then. The SPAC’s stock has climbed as high as $22.47 a share, but slipped in the past week to trade closer to $16 a share.', 'The company is one of the latest in a series of space ventures that have announced deals to go public through a SPAC in the past few months – alongside BlackSky, AST & Science, and Momentus in the past few months.', 'Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic also went public through a deal with Chamath Palihapitiya’s SPAC in 2019.', 'Astra expects to have as much as $500 million in cash proceeds after the deal. That sum includes $200 million from a “private investment in public equity” or PIPE fundraising round led by BlackRock.', '“We convinced BlackRock, and a whole bunch of other conservative long-only investors, that the economics when you start manufacturing small rockets at scale pretty much cancel out what you get with a giant rocket. You get the same economics when you start making hundreds of rockets every year out of a factory,” Kemp said.', 'As for the $30 million venture funding round that Astra closed prior to announcing the SPAC merger, that effort included a $10 million infusion from Holicity’s sponsors.', 'Astra’s investor presentation disclosed that the company has more than $150 million in contracted revenue from government and commercial customers to launch more than 100 spacecraft.', 'The firm also boasts a $1.2 billion pipeline for future launches, although Kemp caveated that as “kind of squishy stuff” like memorandum of understanding (MOU) agreements.', 'Kemp said Astra is “trying to build a 100-year plan” and last year was “running things lean” during the beginning of the pandemic to complete its rocket development testing.', 'Kemp and London, Astra’s technology chief, are controlling shareholders in the company, together owning about 30% of the company.', 'Both have super-voting shares, which vote 10-to-1 compared to common shares – a common practice for Silicon Valley companies.', '“Companies that are building long-term businesses and founders that are committed to a long-term vision or company don’t let investors take over their company,” Kemp said. “It didn’t happen at Facebook or Google or Amazon, and I think these [are the kind of companies] we aspire to be like.”', 'The company’s risk factors, listed in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, also give investors a sense of what challenges Astra may see as it works toward its goals.', 'Astra highlighted that it has “not yet delivered customer satellites into orbit using any of our launch vehicles or rockets, and any setbacks we may experience during our first commercial launch planned for 2021 and other demonstration and commercial missions could have a material adverse effect on our business.”', 'The marketplace of launching small satellites is another key risk.', 'Astra noted that, while it sees significant growth in the years ahead, the market “is still emerging” and “not well established.” Noting that other companies are building small rockets, and Astra expects “to face intense competition.”', 'Lastly, regulatory delays outside of Astra’s concern are another risk, as the company requires licenses from U.S. regulators like the Federal Aviation Administration for launches.', '“No company has yet conducted licensed launches at the annual rate we are targeting,” Astra said.', 'Astra laid out an aggressive timeline for scaling production and generating revenue, starting with its first commercial launch this summer.', 'Kemp said Astra built four rockets last year and stood up three for launch attempts, although Rocket 3.0 was destroyed after an anomaly on the launchpad. Rocket 3.1 suffered a guidance system issue shortly after liftoff, crashing after the engines were shutdown.', 'The company has a future expansion to complete with the SPAC capital, beginning with more investment in its rocket factory. Astra builds 95% of the rocket in-house from raw materials, and also developed its own software for everything from manufacturing to the launch systems.', '“We’re going to automate the factory itself, so that we can get a consistent output of rockets,” Kemp said.', 'Astra forecasts that it will conduct three launches this year, netting $4 million in revenue. The company aims to begin launching at a monthly rate by the end of 2021 – forecasting 15 launches in 2022.', 'That would effectively match the launch pace Rocket Lab, which has launched 97 satellites on 18 missions to date.', 'The company is targeting a weekly launch rate in 2023, with 55 launches bringing in $206 million in revenue. Astra aims to triple that rate in 2024, with 165 launches and rockets going up twice a week – when the company also expects to turn cash-flow positive.', 'By 2025, Astra aims to be launching almost daily and cross the billion-dollar revenue mark, forecasting $1.12 billion in launch revenue for that year.', 'But, as Kemp noted above, Astra wants to build more than just rockets.', 'The company is working on a cylindrical, disc-shaped “modular spacecraft” so that customers can integrate satellite sensors and technology demonstrations directly into Astra’s rocket.', '“Rockets are always going to be a cylinder, so [a disc is] the perfect form factor to put inside a cylinder, where you don’t waste any volume in the rocket, and then you can stack them,” Kemp said.', 'The practice of “ridesharing” on launches has become common, as small satellites hitch a ride on big rockets to get into space for lower prices. But Kemp says it’s a “nightmare” for those small satellites, as “they all get dumped off in the same place.”', '“That’s the current state of the industry, and it sucks,” he said. “It’s like putting a FedEx truck on a plane and flying it to New York and then driving it back to Los Angeles, and then driving the truck off a cliff.”', 'Instead, Kemp says Astra’s modular spacecraft will allow the company to drop off individual satellites in specific orbits on the same launch.', 'Astra forecast its modular spacecraft business will begin generating revenue in 2022, which it expects will climb to more than $300 million a year by 2025.', 'The other differentiator Astra has from other small rocket builders is minimal and mobile infrastructure required for launches, which Kemp says will become a money-maker as a spaceport service.', '“Our entire system packs into four shipping containers, which we can put on a C-130 Hercules [aircraft], on a truck, on a ship – and we’ve done all of those things already,” Kemp said.', 'Astra’s launch infrastructure requires five employees to unpack, who Kemp says can then prepare the rocket to launch in less than a week.', 'For the Rocket 3.2 launch in December, Kemp noted that one of the five employees Astra had sent to Kodiak, Alaska tested positive for COVID-19. The company quarantined the original team in hotel rooms, chartered a plane and flew up five more people to launch the rocket.', '“All I need is a license from the FAA, we put a fence around a gravel pad, and we launch from there in five days with five people,” Kemp said.', 'The company plans to add spaceports all around the country, Kemp noted, and even in other countries that are U.S. allies.', '“There are 80 space agencies and 75 of them have no way to get to space,” Kemp said.', 'Subscribe to CNBC PRO for exclusive insights and analysis, and live business day programming from around the world.']"
2,"Alaska, in ‘hard-core survival mode,’ is America’s worst state for business in 2021",2021-07-13T12:13:20+0000,"['These are tough times in Skagway, Alaska, population 1,183.', '“We’re in hard-core survival mode,” Mayor Andrew Cremata told CNBC.', 'In a normal summer, the Southeast Alaska town would be teeming with tourists from the cruise ships sailing the Inside Passage. Residents could drive 15 miles up the Yukon Highway into Canada to run their basic errands, or they could hop on a state-run ferry to the next town over, Haines.', 'But this year, the cruise ships have just started running again. Cremata is hoping Skagway will see 100,000 passengers this year; in 2019 they had 1.1 million. The border to Canada remains closed to non-essential traffic, and the ferries, part of the Alaska Marine Highway System, are plagued by budget cuts.', '“Just getting your family down to go see a dentist or doctor, when that becomes burdensome or overly expensive, there’s a point where people have just had it and move away,” Cremata said.', 'Multiply Skagway’s situation by thousands of communities and more than 700,000 Alaskans, and you can begin to understand why The Last Frontier finds itself in last place in CNBC’s 2021 America’s Top States for Business rankings.', 'It is the sixth bottom-state finish for Alaska in 14 years. The state previously achieved the dubious distinction in the first four years of the study between 2007 and 2010, hitting bottom again in 2018.', 'As difficult as the past year has been in this state and across the country, it presented opportunities that Alaska failed to capitalize on.', 'Alaska met the pandemic with the best-funded public health system in the nation, according to the United Health Foundation, spending $289 per person per year. That is more than three times the national average. Earlier this year, the state was setting the pace for Covid-19 vaccinations, even in its most remote regions.', 'As the national economy struggled to regain its footing, Alaska offered a generally business-friendly regulatory climate — its legal system tilts toward business, and the number of state laws and regulations is manageable. The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation ranks Alaska’s tax climate the third-best in the country.', 'In Skagway, Mayor Cremata said state and federal officials have been extremely helpful through the crisis.', '“They are always ready and willing not only to engage us as a community, but individual people and business owners in the community. People that were struggling with problems with unemployment and all these kinds of things,” he said.', 'And at a time of social upheaval, Alaska offered its relatively diverse population some strong protections against discrimination.', 'So how did Alaska manage to finish No. 50 again in 2021 despite so many advantages going in? In a word: cost.', 'Cost of Doing Business carries the most weight in this year’s study. As the recovery builds, states are touting low business costs more than any other factor, according to CNBC’s analysis. Alaska is an extremely expensive place to do business.', 'Even Alaska’s competitive tax climate, which earns points for relatively low property taxes and no personal income tax, includes a top corporate tax rate of 9.4%, among the highest in the country.', 'Utility costs are oppressive. Alaskans paid an average of 20.20 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity last year, according to U.S. Department of Energy data, with even higher rates in remote areas. That was second only to Hawaii, and nearly double the national average. Wages are high thanks to the high cost of living, and office and industrial space — which are in short supply — is pricey.', 'Cremata said he is worried about how the price of everything seems to be creeping higher.', '“Everything’s barged in,” he said. “And so, if the cost of fuel goes up, it affects the rates on the barge and that affects the price of your milk and eggs.”', 'Indeed, even that high rate of public health funding may be deceiving, because health care in Alaska is so expensive. An office visit to a doctor in Anchorage averaged more than $206 last year, according to the Council for Community and Economic Research, C2ER. That is more than twice the cost in Phoenix, Arizona.', 'Meanwhile, Alaska’s Covid-19 vaccination rate, once the envy of the nation, has fallen below the national average, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.', 'In March, Alaska became the first state in the nation to make vaccines available to everyone aged 16 and older. Officials theorize that meant those who wanted to be vaccinated were quick to get their shots, leaving vaccine-hesitant residents — many in rural or remote areas — who have proven difficult to convince.', 'Vaccination rates are a metric in the Top States’ Life, Health and Inclusion category, where Alaska finishes No. 19 this year.', 'In addition to its cost issues, Alaska ranks No. 49 in the Top States’ Infrastructure category, above only Maine. It is yet another lost opportunity. Alaska might have been able to use the nation’s move toward remote work to partly offset its inherent infrastructure disadvantages, which include its distance from the rest of the country and its vast size.', 'This year’s Top States study introduced broadband connectivity as an infrastructure metric. But broadband in Alaska is the worst in the nation, according to BroadbandNow Research.', 'In Skagway, Cremata said internet service is cumbersome and expensive.', '“You have to actually have a landline in your house for it to work,” he said. “So, the internet has a pretty substantial price to it, but then you also have a $30 charge because you need a landline for the broadband to work.”', 'According to BroadbandNow, fewer than 61% of Alaskans have access to broadband at all, and none have access to a low-priced plan, which the organization defines as costing less than $60 per month. The average speed is a paltry 58.6 Mbps, or one-third the speed in the top-ranked state, New Jersey.', 'Cremata said that early in the pandemic, when he and other local leaders worried the cruise ships could disappear for five years, they convened a task force to consider ways to reinvent the economy. One of the ideas was to make Skagway an internet hub, but it went nowhere.', '“You’d have to have really fast internet, obviously, because you probably want to have all of your communications done in the cloud, which is pretty much impossible right now in Skagway,” he said.', 'In May, Gov. Mike Dunleavy created a task force to recommend ways to improve connectivity in the state.', '“On the heels of a global pandemic, now more than ever do we see the critical role that the internet plays in nearly every part of life and the importance of good connectivity for every Alaskan,” Dunleavy said in a statement.', 'But it is Alaska’s third broadband task force in the last decade, with little to show for the efforts. It is also unclear whether the state can muster the funding needed to bring its service up to date.', 'In his statement announcing the task force, Dunleavy, a Republican, emphasized the use of federal pandemic relief money to pay for the expansion. And while his administrative order creating the task force also contemplates using state funds, Dunleavy and the state legislature are already locked in a titanic struggle over the budget.', 'This month, Dunleavy vetoed more than $200 million in state spending approved by the legislature, with cuts aimed at everything from tourism marketing to mental health services.', 'Dunleavy also vetoed $8.5 million in funding for Alaska’s ferry system known as the Alaska Marine Highway System, a link to the outside world for communities like Skagway. ', 'And he relentlessly slashed the University of Alaska’s budget, with cuts totaling $70 million over three years. That hurts the state’s ranking in Education, where it finishes No. 47.', 'Hanging over all of Alaska’s business and financial woes is the price of oil, the state’s economic lifeblood. Oil revenues typically account for more than one-third of the state’s budget.', 'Last year, as weak demand during the pandemic pushed oil prices to historic lows, oil production in Alaska fell to its lowest level in more than 40 years, according to the Energy Department.', 'This year, prices have rebounded, but production in Alaska has not. Alaska oil producers face much lower cost competition in the lower 48, as well as an intensifying tug-of-war over federal oil leases. Production through April was down nearly 5% from a year ago.', 'State budget forecasters expect oil production tax revenue will be around $311 million in the 2021 fiscal year that ended on July 1. That would be a 9% increase from 2020, but a 36% decline from the year before.', 'Those kinds of numbers could make it even harder for Alaska to climb out of the cellar next year.', 'Cremata said he hopes the crisis will convince Alaska to think beyond its traditional economic drivers including tourism, fishing and oil.', '“You can’t think backwards. You have to think forwards,” he said. “Perhaps, this is like a chaos-opportunity moment — where there’s chaos, there’s opportunity, so that people in Alaska, who maybe have been relying on things that aren’t as reliable anymore, maybe try to expand towards some different ideas.”', 'Correction: This story was updated to correct that Alaskans paid an average of 20.20 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity last year.']"

Many new technologies, such as self-driving cars, are underpinned by rapid developments and global deployment of 5G networks. For its part, Singapore plans to have full island-wide standalone 5G coverage by 2025.', 'The program will “support AI and cybersecurity research for next-generation communications infrastructures,” Heng said at the Asia Tech x Singapore conference.', 'It will “support testbeds for innovative pilots, and provide scholarships for those seeking to pursue research in communications.”', 'The program will also aim to build international partnerships and strengthen cross-border collaborations, according to Heng, who is also Singapore’s coordinating minister for economic policies.', 'Singapore will also be launching a digital exchange known as the Singapore Trade Data Exchange, or SGTraDex. It will allow multiple stakeholders — such as logistics players, shippers and buyers — to share valuable information like real-time cargo locations. The information is said to be encrypted and transmitted, without being stored.', 'The initiative is expected to stamp out significant inefficiencies around the movement of goods along the supply chain. For example, logistics and shipping companies would be able to optimize cargo handling and operations.', '“From the pilots so far, SGTraDex has the potential to unlock more than $150 million of value annually for the supply chain ecosystem,” Heng said. It would also speed up the processing of customs clearance, trade financing, insurance and other related activities, he added.', 'SGTraDex is similar to another initiative launched last year called the Singapore Financial Data Exchange, or SGFinDex. It allows users to sign in with their national digital identity to access their consolidated financial data — such as deposits, credit cards, loans and investments — from participating banks and relevant government agencies on a single platform.', 'Heng pointed out that having the ability to allow data to flow securely and seamlessly can help countries unlock the full potential of digitalization.', 'Southeast Asia’s digital economy is fast-growing and its internet sectors are expected to cross $300 billion by 2025, according to an industry report from Google, Temasek Holdings and Bain & Company.', 'The coronavirus pandemic accelerated the push toward digitalization as many businesses, big and small, had to shift their presence online in the face of social restrictions and lockdowns.', '“Just as globalization drove decades of economic growth around the world, I believe the fast-growing digital economy can propel us to a better future,” Heng said.']"
4,Soaring warehouse demand boosts commercial real estate market as office vacancies mount,2021-07-10T15:54:56+0000,"['After ShipBob decided last July to let staffers work from anywhere, the logistics start-up had its landlord erect a wall in the middle of its Chicago headquarters so half the space could be rented out to another company.', 'On March 1, the office reopened at reduced capacity for socially distanced meetings.', 'But while it’s using less office space, ShipBob’s real estate needs have been expanding at a breakneck pace. The company, which provides fulfillment services to online retailers, has more than doubled its warehouse count since mid-2020 to 24 locations today, including four outside the U.S., with plans to reach 35 by the end of 2021.', 'The seven-year-old company is a microcosm of the U.S. commercial real estate market. While office vacancies have soared as employers prepare for a post-Covid future of distributed work, the industrial market is hotter than ever because of a pandemic-fueled surge in e-commerce and increased consumer demand to get more products at Amazon-like speeds.', 'Vacancy rates in industrial buildings are near a record low and new warehouses can’t get built quickly enough to meet the needs of clothing makers, furniture sellers and home appliance manufacturers. Real estate firm CBRE said in its first-quarter report on the industrial and logistics market that almost 100 million square feet of space was absorbed in the period, the third-highest amount ever, and that a record 376 million square feet is under construction.', 'Rents rose 7.1% in the quarter from the same period a year earlier to an all-time high of $8.44 per square foot, CBRE said. The firm wrote in a follow-up report last month that prices in coastal markets near population centers and inland port hubs are soaring by double-digit percentages. In Northern New Jersey, average base rent for industrial properties jumped 33% in May from a year earlier, and California’s Inland Empire saw an increase of 24%, followed by Philadelphia at 20%.', '“The need to have facilities in these markets, coupled with record low vacancy rates, has often led to bidding wars among occupiers that are driving up rental rates,” CBRE said.', 'The wheels were well in motion before Covid-19 hit the U.S. in early 2020. Amazon was already turning next-day delivery into the default option for Prime members, and big box stores like Best Buy and Walmart were racing to add fulfillment space to try and keep pace.', 'The pandemic accelerated everything. Consumers were stuck at home and ordering more stuff, while physical stores had to go digital to stay afloat.', 'Grocery delivery added to the market tightness, as Instacart and Postmates were suddenly inundated with orders from customers who didn’t want to enter a Costco, Albertsons or Kroger store. Instacart is now planning a network of fulfillment centers loaded up with cereal-picking robots, according to Bloomberg, and Target has bolstered same-day fulfillment through so-called sortation centers.', 'In addition to the rapid change in consumer behavior, the pandemic also exposed the fragility of the global supply chain. With facilities in China and elsewhere shuttered, stores experienced dramatic shortages of apparel, car parts and packaging materials.', 'Retailers responded by securing more storage space to mitigate the impact of future shocks, said James Koman, CEO of ElmTree Funds, a private equity firm focused on commercial real estate.', '“The reshoring of manufacturing is gaining momentum,” Koman said. Companies are “bringing more products onshore and need to have room for their products so we don’t fall into another situation like we’re in right now.”', 'All of those factors are contributing to skyrocketing prices, he said. Additionally, construction costs are higher because of inflation and supply constraints, and companies are building more sophisticated facilities, filled with robots.', '“You have these automatic forklifts, conveyor belts, and automated storage retrieval systems,” Koman said. “All this is where the world is going.”', 'Betting on a long-term need for fulfillment and logistics facilities, ElmTree has acquired about $2 billion worth of industrial space over the past seven months, outpacing prior years, Koman said. He estimates the U.S. will need an additional 135-150 million square feet annually to support e-commerce growth.', 'For ShipBob, the e-commerce boom has played right into its business model. But competition for space is simultaneously forcing the company to reckon with higher costs.', 'ShipBob works with brands like perfume company Dossier, powdered energy drink maker Juspy and Tom Brady’s sports and fitness brand TB12, providing a wide network of fulfillment centers for fast and reliable shipping and software to manage deliveries and inventory.', 'Unlike the retail giants, ShipBob doesn’t go after large football field-sized fulfillment centers, and only has leases at a few of its facilities. Rather, it looks for warehouses that are typically family-owned with 75,000-100,000 square feet and some unused capacity. It then outfits them with ShipBob technology and pays based on order volume and the amount of space it uses.', 'While ShipBob isn’t signing leases, it is competing for space in warehouses that are now sitting on much more valuable property than they were a year ago. ShipBob CEO Dhruv Saxena said that his company has to be in areas like Southern California and Louisville, Kentucky, a major transportation and logistics hub, despite the rapid increase in prices.', '“We have to find ways of placing inventory closer to the end customer even if it comes at a lower margin for us,” Saxena said in an interview late last month after his company raised $200 million at a valuation topping $1 billion.', 'ShipBob competes directly with a number of fulfillment outsourcing start-ups, including ShipMonk, Deliverr and Shippo. Those four companies have raised almost $900 million combined in the past year.', 'Saxena said a major reason smaller retailers turn to ShipBob is to avoid the costs and hassle of finding fulfillment space and hiring the requisite workers. He likened it to companies outsourcing their computing and data storage needs to Amazon Web Services and paying for how much capacity they use rather than leasing their own data centers.', '“The same math applies,” Saxena said. “I can open a warehouse, hire people and rig the software or I can convert those fixed costs into variable costs where I pay on a transaction basis.”', 'Nate Faust is in the very early stages of building Olive, an e-commerce start-up that’s working with brands to offer more sustainable packaging and delivery options by using recycled boxing materials and bundling items.', 'Olive opened its first two 30,000 square foot warehouses last year, one in New Jersey and the other in Southern California. Faust, who previously co-founded Jet.com and then worked at Walmart after the acquisition, said if he were entering those leases today, they’d easily be 10% to 15% higher.', 'Olive isn’t actively in the market for more fulfillment centers and doesn’t face a lease renewal until February, but Faust said start-ups have to be opportunistic.

Whether they reap the benefits of physical stores could shape the path ahead for other online-first companies.', 'The two businesses have become synonymous with the term “direct-to-consumer” in the retail industry. The strategy involves avoiding wholesale channels, such as department stores, to forge stronger relationships with customers. DTC companies have few or no brick-and-mortar locations.', 'Dozens — if not hundreds — of brands have debuted and labeled themselves in the DTC category in recent years. Products range from makeup and pajamas to toothbrushes and deodorants.', 'As Warby Parker and Allbirds prepare to make their respective public market debuts, they’ve entered a fresh expansion phase with aggressive goals. Investors and analysts will hold them accountable.', 'The success of their next moves, including the planned rollout of more physical stores, will likely carry implications for the brands following in their footsteps.', 'For one, both businesses lose money. It’s unclear when — if ever — they’ll become profitable. Allbirds’ net loss totaled $14.5 million in 2019 and grew to $25.9 million in 2020.', 'Warby Parker broke even in 2019, and its net loss last year was $55.9 million.', 'While opening up stores comes with added fixed costs, brick-and-mortar retail remains the best channel to find new customers. Warby Parker and Allbirds are betting on shops as they prepare to go public.', 'Allbirds is going public through an initial public offering, while Warby Parker is using a direct listing. In the latter, shares are not taken public by a team of underwriters.', 'An online-only model is only sustainable for so long, experts say. The success or failure of these companies’ public debuts could fuel additional IPOs or lead retail companies that have followed a DTC model to look to other exit strategies.', '“There was this early euphoria that there was a new model where you didn’t need stores anymore,” said Jason Goldberg, chief commerce strategy officer at advertising firm Publicis. “Like stores and the traditional business model was all old school, and the new way of doing things was going directly to the consumer ... slapping up a website and inventing a cool product.”', 'Companies are figuring out the model is not sustainable, Goldberg said.', '“There’s a certain phase of your infant growth where you can achieve success without stores, and it can be really easy to acquire customers,” he said. “But no digitally native brand has achieved a billion dollars in annual revenue without a store. You need those stores as a cost-effective customer acquisition channel at some point.”', 'Emory University assistant marketing professor Dan McCarthy keeps tabs on companies such as Casper Sleep, Figs, Revolve and Peloton as he monitors Warby Parker and Allbirds.

It has also since opened more than 70 of its own stores. It’s further evidence of a company initially fueled by web sales seeing the benefits of real estate.', 'Allbirds, the sustainable shoe brand that got its start in Silicon Valley, said it has “just scratched the surface” of its potential to open stores, particularly in the United States.', 'The company counted 27 retail locations globally as of June 30, according to an SEC filing.', '“As our store fleet expands, we expect our growth to accelerate, as compared to 2020,” Allbirds said. “We believe our new stores will also be highly profitable, have attractive payback periods, serve as good capital investments, and be positioned well to take advantage of physical retail’s recovery from the pandemic.”', 'The company said e-commerce accounted for 89% of total sales last year, and stores made up the rest. Its brick-and-mortar shops were shut for weeks in 2020 due to the Covid crisis. Through June 30, shoppers who visited both a physical location and the website spent 1.5-times more money than a customer who only went to a store or shopped online alone, Allbirds said.', 'The company pointed to its Boston Back Bay location to show the benefits of opening a shop. In the three months after the store’s debut in March 2019, web traffic in the area rose 15%. The company saw 83% more new customers in the neighborhood.', 'To leverage the benefits of stores, companies may not need to target expensive markets like New York City or Los Angeles. Web Smith, founder of 2PM, recently wrote in a memo to subscribers that direct-to-consumer brands should look more closely at opening stores in second- or third-tier cities, such as Columbus, Ohio, for locations.', '“The DTC industry is a club and clubs have rules made to be broken,” Smith said. “For the retailers with the courage to think outside of the box, opportunities to breakthrough can be found far outside the cities and strategies of the status quo.”', 'Meanwhile, glasses maker Warby Parker said it had more than 145 stores as of June 30.

Rapid expansion has gotten companies in trouble in the past and pushed numerous businesses into bankruptcy court to get out of leases.', '“It used to be all about malls,” Green said. “You could figure out a mall strategy and put up 200, 400 stores. ... Now, I just think we flip that equation, and the initial driver is building the presence online.”', 'For the likes of Warby Parker and Allbirds, the benefits of opening up more stores come with higher fixed costs and the liability of a lease.', 'But many businesses have found ways to manage those costs.

Target leverages its stores, in turn, to lower costs associated with shipping and transportation.', '“You can build a business of a certain size online,” Green said. “But the reality is, if you really have scale in mind, you are going to need to think about meeting the customer where the customer is. And they are in a lot of different places.”', 'Warby Parker and Allbirds have decided they need to expand their offerings to move toward profitability. The success of their public debuts will have implications for other companies that followed their online-first model, according to Publicis’ Goldberg.', '“It’s a positive affirmation for the model that this first class [of DTC brands] is starting to get exits, because so far there have been some good acquisitions ... but the market wasn’t very ripe for these IPOs,” he said.', '“Now that the market is starting to seemingly tolerate some of these ideas — and especially if they’re successful with these unit economics — that’s going to evolve into a whole second wave of digitally native companies trying to follow in those footsteps,” he said.']"

It’s my first,” Dell said on “Squawk on the Street,” referring to the 1918 flu pandemic. Katz’s, initially founded in 1888, moved to its current location on Houston Street a year before that health crisis began.', 'For this pandemic, which has devastated the restaurant industry, Dell said he’s using a “make-it-up-as-you-go” approach.', '“Make the best decision we can in the moment without losing touch with the nostalgia and tradition that’s truly at the core of Katz’s,” said Dell, a fifth-generation owner.', 'While the pandemic is not yet over, Dell said lessons Katz’s has learned in the past 11 months will help the deli succeed in the decades ahead, such as website development. Strategic decisions Katz’s made in the years preceding the coronavirus crisis have helped keep it afloat, too, he said.', 'Dell’s comments came as limited indoor dining at New York City restaurants was set to resume after Gov. Andrew Cuomo paused it indefinitely in mid-December. Some health experts have questioned the timing, citing new coronavirus variants that are believed to be more transmissible. But for many in the city’s dining industry, the resumption of indoor dining is being cheered as a much-needed way to boost revenue during the bitter winter.', 'Katz’s will have about 17 or 18 tables available to comply with the 25% capacity restriction, Dell said. The deli will revert to the health protocols it used during the fall when the city permitted indoor dining, he said.', 'Dell acknowledged Katz’s is fortunate because its dining room size makes 25% capacity more sustainable than it is for smaller restaurants. From a business standpoint, it’s hard for most eateries to get by with only a quarter of tables being available, Dell said.', '“One thing that we focused on really hard was our website and focusing on bringing the customer experience to your door, the true Katz’s experience. You can’t make it to the Lower East Side, so how do we bring it to you?” said Dell, who joined the restaurant in 2009. His father, Alan, was involved before him.', 'Fortunately, Katz’s experience shipping food across the U.S. dates to World War II, when its slogan, “Send a salami to your boy in the Army,” was coined, Dell said. But when the pandemic hit last spring — grinding New York tourism to halt and shutting down indoor dining — Katz’s really had to scale up its logistics operation.', 'That meant retraining some employees, like dishwashers, on how to properly pack mustard, pickles and knishes so the food can be shipped throughout the country, Dell said. “And that has grown tremendously and we really hope that continues once all is back to normal.”', 'As for local delivery, Dell said Katz’s built its own network a few years ago to avoid having to pay an “egregious” fee to third-party providers, such as DoorDash and Uber Eats. “We just bit the bullet and built a giant [delivery] factory a couple years ago and it’s paid off,” Dell said. “We’ve been lucky. We haven’t actually laid anyone off during this pandemic, and I’m pretty grateful for that.”', 'Katz’s received a loan through the Paycheck Protection Program worth $1 million to $2 million, according to a database compiled by nonprofit journalism site ProPublica. The loan was approved May 3 and helped retain 143 jobs, the database shows.', 'Asked why Dell fought to keep Katz’s open during the depths of the pandemic, he said: “Because you have to. You put your head down and you go forward. You take it one decision at a time.”', '“When the pandemic started, we immediately started giving out soups to ... low income and senior citizen buildings in the neighborhood. We’ve served, I think, something like 30,000 meals, all five boroughs, to over 30 hospitals to front-line workers,” Dell added, saying Katz’s felt obligated to help as a family-run business. “The community takes care of you.

As it turns out, the industries make for compatible bedfellows.', 'Just take Hayden Griffin Haby III, an oilman turned bitcoiner. The Texas native and father of three has spent 14 years in oil and gas, and he epitomizes what this monthly meetup is all about. ', 'Haby started as a surface landman where he brokered land contracts, and later, ran his own oil company. But for the last nine months, he’s exclusively been in the business of mining bitcoin.', 'As Haby describes it, he was “orange pilled” in November 2020 – a term used to describe the process of convincing a fiat-minded person that they are missing out by not investing in bitcoin. A month later, he co-founded Limpia Creek Technologies, which powers bitcoin mining rigs with flared, vented, and stranded natural gas assets.', '“When I heard that you could make this much money per MCF (a metric used to measure natural gas), instead of just burning it up into the atmosphere, thanks to the whole ‘bitcoin mining thing,’ I couldn’t look away,” Haby said. “You can’t unsee that.”', 'When China kicked out all its crypto miners this spring – an exodus which Haby calls the “Chexit” – that poured kerosene on the flames. “This is an opportunity we didn’t think was coming,” he said.', 'Haby tells CNBC they are already seeing demand rushing to Texas, and he is convinced that the state is poised to capture most of the Chinese hashrate looking for a new home on friendlier shores.', 'Bitcoin miners care most about finding cheap sources of electricity, so Texas – with its crypto-friendly politicians, deregulated power grid, and crucially, abundance of inexpensive power sources – is a virtually perfect fit. The union becomes even more harmonious when miners connect their rigs to otherwise stranded energy, like natural gas going to waste on oil fields across Texas.', '“This is Texas, boys. We got what you need, so come on down,” said Haby. “We are sitting on the energy capital of the world.”', '“I think Kevin Costner said it best: ‘If you build it, they will come,’” said Haby.', 'Parker Lewis is one of Texas’ de facto bitcoin ambassadors. Everyone knows him. Everyone likes him.

In May, the Houston Bitcoin Meetup consisted of only 20 people in a fluorescent-lit conference room in an office. Then Lewis decided to get involved.', '“I just knew Houston would be prime to explode because of the energy connection to mining – if we organized a good meetup,” Lewis told CNBC. “It’s also key to Texas being the bitcoin capital of the world.”', 'His efforts are paying off. Wednesday’s meetup drew more than 200 attendees from across the state of Texas, as well as California, Colorado, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, New York, Australia and the UK.', 'The buzz was electric on Wednesday night.

Whereas oil can easily be trucked out to a remote destination, gas delivery requires a pipeline.  ', 'If a drilling site is right next door to a pipeline, they chuck the gas in and take whatever cash the buyer on the other end is willing to pay that day. “There’s no choice. There’s no middle finger. Whatever gas comes out that day has to be sold,” explained Haby.', 'But if it’s 20 miles from a pipeline, things start to get more complicated. ', 'More often than not, the gas well won’t be big enough to warrant the time and expense of building an entirely new pipeline. If a driller can’t immediately find a way to sell the stash of natural gas, most look to dispose of it on site.', 'One method is to vent it, which releases methane directly into the air – a poor choice for the environment, as its greenhouse effects are shown to be much stronger than carbon dioxide. A more environmentally friendly option is to flare it, which means actually lighting the gas on fire. ', '“Chemistry is amazing,” explained Adam Ortolf, who heads up business development in the U.S. for Upstream Data, a company that manufactures and supplies portable mining solutions for oil and gas facilities.

It now works with 140 bitcoin mines across North America.', '“This is the best gift the oil and gas industry could’ve gotten,” said Ortolf. “They were leaving a lot of hydrocarbons on the table, but now, they’re no longer limited by geography to sell energy.” ', 'It is also helping to curtail the overall carbon footprint of some of these oil and gas sites. Recent production stats show that in the U.S. alone about 1.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas is wasted on a daily basis. And these are just the reported numbers, so the actual figures are likely higher.', 'Meanwhile, bitcoin miners get what they want most: cheap electricity.

', '“While many retailers have been forced to raise prices due to inflation or supply chain pressure, we do not have the same level of exposure,” James Reinhart, CEO of ThredUp, said on the company’s recent third quarter earnings call.  ', 'ThredUp’s business is entirely sourced domestically from its users, according to Reinhart, and has no reliance on direct manufacturing for inventory.  ', '“We have chosen to strategically lower prices in order to engage as many customers as possible during a time when consumers are feeling price pressure in many other parts of their life,” he added.  ', 'ThredUp’s prices averaged 15% lower in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. Reinhart said the company will continue to keep prices down through ThredUp’s domestic supply system.

18,Why Nvidia is spending $40 billion on Arm,2020-09-15T10:00:01+0000,"['Nvidia’s planned purchase of buy Arm from SoftBank for $40 billion would be the largest semiconductor deal of all time by dollar value if it is completed. ', 'But the dollar value may actually understate the importance of the deal, announced Sunday. ', 'Arm is at the heart of nearly every smartphone sold today, from Apple iPhones to Samsung Galaxy devices running Google’s Android software. In addition to smartphone processors, Arm technology is used in lots of smaller chips integrated into all kinds of computer systems and devices. Arm said that more than 180 billion chips with its processor cores and other components have been shipped around the world. ', '“They’re in everything, and they power computers of all different types of shapes from the fastest supercomputer in the world, to smart watches and smart thermostats,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC on Monday. ', 'But for Nvidia, Arm represents a chance to boost its fast-growing business of selling chipsets and software to data centers, the massive networks of computers that power large companies and cloud computing networks.', 'In particular, investors believe that Nvidia could closely integrate Arm’s CPU technology with Nvidia’s specialty in graphics processors (GPU) to build a lead on the rest of the semiconductor industry. ', 'Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis said in a note Monday that the deal could let Nvidia bolster its data center business by creating an “ecosystem” of server chips and software ranging from Arm-based CPUs to its GPUs. Nvidia could more closely integrate Arm processors into its products, increasing performance without using additional power.', 'It could also entrench Nvidia and make it harder for competitors to steal business. ', '“With Arm, we think Nvidia is poised to also offer general purpose, heterogeneous data center scale solutions and ultimately capture up to 80% of the value of the serial processing part of the data center ecosystem,” Lipacis wrote. “We also think that Arm gives it a larger moat in the data center.”', 'Nvidia’s shares, already up more than 110% this year, rose more than 5% on Monday and were up 3% in Tuesday’s premarket, suggesting investors have a lot to like from the deal.', 'Both Arm and Nvidia are silicon-focused companies, but they deal with different areas of the semiconductor industry. Huang says Arm and Nvidia are “complementary.” ', 'Arm, based in Cambridge, England, sells the blueprint that other companies need to make low-power chips for devices like smartphones, tablets, virtual reality headsets and smart speakers. It’s called an instruction set. Some customers, like Apple, license Arm’s architecture and design their own CPU cores. Others, like Qualcomm or Samsung, license entire processor designs from Arm. ', 'Arm makes money by selling intellectual property licenses, software, and tools to the chip designers that want to use its technology, taking a royalty on every chip that uses its technology. The company generated revenue of more than $1.7 billion in 2019.', 'Arm was founded in 1990 as part of a joint venture that included Apple, which wanted to use low-power Arm technology in a portable computer called the Newton.', 'But Arm ascended to the forefront of the industry over 15 years later with the help of the smartphone boom. Smartphones needed chips that used significantly less power than the x86-based laptop and desktop chips made by Intel — they wouldn’t have as much computing power as a laptop, but at least their battery would last for more than a few hours. The first iPhone had an underpowered Samsung processor with an ARM processing core.', 'Since then, chips with Arm-based cores have become the standard for Apple and Android phones and have become significantly more powerful, even challenging power-hungry desktop or laptop chips in performance for some tasks. Qualcomm’s chips, used in Samsung, Google, and Huawei phones, use Arm cores. ', 'Arm is also making inroads into other types of computers beyond smartphones. Apple is planning to shift its Mac laptops and desktops to in-house chips using Arm technology. Microsoft has spent a lot of time and money adapting Windows to run on Arm chips, too. And Arm chips are increasingly being used in data centers, where their low power draw can be an advantage.', 'When Softbank bought Arm in 2016 it also emphasized potential in the “internet of things,” or the trend that an increasing number of things, such as machinery or cars, could be equipped with internet connectivity and a cheap microprocessor — running on Arm technology, of course.', 'Nvidia, led by co-founder Huang, was originally best known for designing chips that would enable central processors to offload 3D graphics work to increase power and efficiency. Its customers were gamers, companies building gaming systems, and people who needed power to build 3D graphics. ', 'Games are still a big part of Nvidia’s business. But in the past decade, Nvidia has started to expand into a number of different categories.', 'In 2008, Nvidia started building its own “system-on-a-chip” (SoC) hardware under the Tegra brand, combining its graphics processors along with Arm processor cores in one product. A Tegra chip is at the heart of the Nintendo Switch console, for example, although the product line has not gained as much traction among smartphone makers as Qualcomm’s Snapdragon. Nvidia’s self-driving car platform includes hardware chips with Arm cores. It now builds chips and software for self-driving cars and robots.', 'But the biggest tailwind at Nvidia’s back in recent years was the rise of artificial intelligence. Researchers found that graphics processors — Nvidia’s speciality — were well adapted to run power-hungry artificial intelligence algorithms more efficiently than older server chips or simple CPUs.', 'As Nvidia’s ambitions have swelled, so have the company’s fortunes. At the start of trading on Monday it was valued over $322 billion, a startling rise from five years ago when it was worth about $12.3 billion, according to FactSet data. In its fiscal 2020, which ended on Jan. 26, Nvidia reported $10.92 billion in revenue, down 7% from $11.72 billion a year earlier. ', 'Some analysts see the deal as primarily a boost to Nvidia’s data center business, the company’s fastest-growing unit. In the quarter ending in June, it reported $1.75 billion in data center revenue, or about 45% of the company’s sales, surpassing its gaming unit for the first time. Data center sales were up 167% on a year-over-year basis. ', 'Here’s how Huang described the data center vision on Monday: “If you think about all the chips that have been shipped, 22 billion chips that were shipped last year, we know very well going forward that AI will be infused into them.” ', 'Nvidia sees an opportunity to sell its AI chips and graphics chips to Arm’s customers, too. “If we could leverage their business model, if we could stand on the network they’ve created and take the technology we’ve invented and put it into that channel and make it available to their thousands of partners, the economics for us would be incredible,” Huang said. ', 'But many of those Arm customers compete with Nvidia, including Samsung, Qualcomm, Broadcom and Texas Instruments.', 'These companies may balk at being sold additional technology from a competitor. Nvidia says it will continue to operate Arm as an independent subsidiary with a “customer neutral” and “open-licensing” model — basically, if companies can pay for it, they can obtain a license, even if they’re direct competitors with Nvidia.', 'Huang said Monday that Arm CEO Simon Segars had already spoken to many of its customers to answer their questions about the deal. ', '“They want to know they can continue to rely on Arm. The fact that we’re announcing the deal today suggests that the conversations went fine. Although nobody likes change, if they realize we’re committed to the business model, we’re committed to openness and fairness, and more than that, we want to keep everything the same, plus we want to add our IP to it, so they can have more to purchase and more value we can deliver to them,” Huang said.

', 'The deserted Safer FSO tanker, which is believed to contain approximately 1.14 million barrels of oil, has been anchored and left without maintenance off the Yemeni coast of Al Hudaydah since early 2015, according to the UN. ', 'The tanker, which was described in a recent op-ed from The Atlantic Council as a “floating bomb,” is thought to be eroding fast. ', 'There are concerns that following years of inertia in a salty and corrosive maritime environment, volatile gases have built up in the storage tanks — increasing the risk of an explosion. ', 'However, UN officials’ plans to inspect the ship in order to assess the scale of the damage has repeatedly been blocked. ', 'Matt Lowcock, the UN undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs, said in a speech to the Security Council last week that Houthi authorities “continue to delay” any assessment of the tanker. ', 'Lowcock pointed out that this was “additionally frustrating” because Houthi authorities had actually contacted the UN in early 2018 requesting assistance with the tanker and promising to facilitate their work. ', '“If the tanker ruptures or explodes, we could see the coastline polluted all along the Red Sea.

25,Dry ice sales booming as hospitals get ready to store Pfizer’s Covid vaccine at minus 94 degrees,2020-12-09T22:19:00+0000,"['The ultra-cold temperatures required for storing the Covid-19 vaccine developed by U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and Germany-based BioNTech has driven a buying frenzy for freezers and dry ice. However, large-scale freezers units are expensive — and with hospital budgets already strained during the pandemic, dry ice has emerged as the go-to option.', 'That’s how Chris Vida, owner of Dry Ice Depot, described what he’s seeing right now.', 'Vida’s business — located in Bridgewater, New Jersey — ships on average 40,000 to 50,000 pounds of dry ice per day. He told CNBC that new orders continue to pour in from hospitals that will have to store their Pfizer vaccine supplies at minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit. ”[Tuesday] was a big day, we moved around 70,000 pounds of dry ice. So our inventory is a little shot. We’ve ramped up double our normal volume at this point.”', 'The average dry ice order amount from hospitals is 170 pounds, Vida said, adding that he’s also receiving big orders from pharmacies and shipping giants like FedEx.', 'Distributors and suppliers across the nation are dealing with a similar situation in preparation of the vaccine receiving emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration. Limited approval could be given this week after the agency’s vaccines committee meets Thursday.', 'Acme Dry Ice in Boston, one of the largest distributors of dry ice in the nation, told CNBC that it’s team plans to work over the holidays to ensure he can fulfill the new orders that are coming in. “There is no sleep for the vaccine or the Covid virus,” said Marc Savenor, president of Acme Dry Ice.', 'Unlike the ice in your home refrigerator, dry ice is a solid form of carbon dioxide, or CO2. Back in March, fewer cars on the road due to the pandemic contributed to a decline in ethanol production, which produces CO2 as a by-product, resulting in a shortage of the gas. Experts said that driving ultimately returned over the summer and CO2 supplies, in turn, have rebounded.', 'Rich Gottwald, president of the Compressed Gas Association, told CNBC the industry is confident there’s enough CO2 product to meet demand for the vaccine. CGA is a trade body representing the biggest CO2 suppliers and dry ice manufacturers. “The shortage that we saw in the spring was really alleviated by the end of the day, by driving coming back over the summer. [Companies] are ready to supply dry ice as soon as the vaccine comes available,” he added.', 'The industrial and chemical companies involved in the production of CO2 and dry ice are not the most high-profile names. Airgas, part of Air Liquide, supplies dry ice. Continental Carbonic, part of Matheson, is another supplier. Germany’s Linde acquired U.S. based Praxair in 2018 for more than $80 billion. Linde, along with Air Products, supply CO2, which is then converted into dry ice by their customers.', 'One of the key challenges with dry ice is that, unlike toilet paper, it can’t stockpiled.', '“Over time dry ice will revert back to its gaseous form, whether that be five, seven, 10 days, it certainly has a lifespan,” Gottwald explained. “At that point, if it’s being used for a vaccine, the product would need to be re-iced .. more ice would be needed to be applied to the vaccine to keep it at that temperature.”', 'It’s one of the key reasons hospitals are looking to set up longstanding contracts with Vida at Dry Ice Depot in New Jersey: To ensure they can come back for refills when they run out. Vida said that one of the hospitals he’s supplying dry ice to is St. Barnabas Hospital in The Bronx in New York City.', 'While hospitals figure out how many vaccines doses they will be allotted, the staff is puzzled over how much dry ice they will need to keep the Pfizer vaccine at the proper temperature. “Now all the questions are starting and, you know, there’s a lot of confusion out there. People really don’t know how its going to be stored, how we’re going to ship. How much do we [hospitals] need,” said Vida.', 'Medical workers and nurse technicians immunizing citizens will also have to learn how to handle dry ice at such fridge temperatures. Experts said that protective gear is needed to avoid frostbite — and if too much is inhaled, it can become a serious health risk.', 'Forensics Detectors — a small business based in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, which specializes in monitoring toxic gases like CO2 — has also seen sales skyrocket. “My sales have increased over 10 times over the past three months, owner Dr. Kos Galatsis told CNBC. “We are sold out of carbon dioxide detectors.”', 'Companies that make ultra-cold freezers also are experiencing a surge in demand.', 'In late November, Dan Hensler, vice president of Cincinnati-based So-Low Environmental Equipment, said the company was “out of everything” despite its efforts to build up an inventory backlog. “It’s been crazy. It’s absolutely been crazy,” he told CNBC then.', 'Carrier and Trane Technologies — both of which specialize in cold storage options from trucks to freezers — told CNBC they’re actively working with Operation Warp Speed, the White House’s public-private program to accelerate the development, manufacturing and distribution of Covid-19 vaccines and treatments.', 'CORRECTION: This article was updated to correct the spelling of the company name Forensics Detectors.', '— CNBC’s Patrick Manning and Kevin Stankiewicz contributed to this story.']"

TipRanks analyst forecasting service attempts to pinpoint the best-performing analysts on the Street. These are the pros with the highest success rate and average return per rating, with both metrics factoring in the number of ratings published by each analyst.   ', 'Here are five stocks that Wall Street’s best-performing analysts think investors might be overlooking.', 'Despite Squarespace’s solid second-quarter performance, Guggenheim analyst Ken Wong is anticipating some concern from investors. However, the analyst’s bullish thesis remains very much intact.', 'In line with his optimistic approach, Wong kept a Buy rating on the website building and hosting company. Although he trimmed the price target from $70 to $60, this still leaves room for a 40% gain over the next year.', 'Digging deeper into the print, Squarespace posted revenue and billings of $196 million (a 31% year-over-year increase) and $206 million (a 24% year-over-year gain), respectively. Both results beat the Street’s $189 million and $200 million calls. Additionally, Presence and Commerce revenue surpassed Wong’s estimates. It should also be noted that most of the increase in take rate came from Tock’s contribution, which Squarespace acquired earlier this year.', '“Management also highlighted better cash retention this year, which should stave off concerns that pandemic subscription cohorts could see elevated churn as economies normalize,” the analyst added.', 'That being said, Wong believes the “flattish Q3 trajectory likely to disappoint investors.” For the full year, the company actually bumped up its revenue outlook by $6 million at the midpoint from a range of $764 million to $776 million to a range of $772 million to $780 million.', '“We believe the increase would have been just ‘good enough’ in a vacuum. However, we expect investors to scrutinize the Q3 revenue outlook guide ($193-198 million, 19-22%), which projects for a modest sequential decline at the mid-point and falls ~$2 million below consensus estimates ($197.5 million). Management emphasized a prudent approach to outlook due to the uncertain macro and health climate. Investors we caught up with were understanding of the volatile demand environment, but felt the lack of specificity around which business segments and KPIs magnified the confusion,” Wong explained.', 'Long-term, though, Wong is standing in the bull camp. “We remain positive on SQSP’s long-term opportunity to enable digital commerce… We expect a more thoughtful growth roadmap at the company’s inaugural Analyst Day in November. Following the noisy outlook, we expect investors to home in on the commentary around revenue mix shift, additional monetization/take rate opportunities, details surrounding the Tock acquisition and integration and other potential long-term growth accelerators,” he commented.       ', 'Currently, Wong is tracking a 68% success rate and 27.1% average return per rating.', 'Following The Trade Desk’s second-quarter earnings call, Needham’s Laura Martin tells investors that there are “several upside value drivers we’ve underestimated, until now.”', 'In accordance with her optimistic stance, the five-star analyst reiterated a Buy rating on the media-buying platform provider. Additionally, Martin left the $100 price target as is, which implies 21% upside potential.', 'What exactly are these value upside drivers? First and foremost, Martin points to TTD’s Unified ID 2.0 solution.

Of this, $84 million, or 80%, was CTV.  ', '“TTD believes that the 79 million households in the U.S. that advertisers can reach using CTV ad units is larger than total linear TV homes… CTV revenues grew faster than 101% total revenue growth year-over-year. CTV consortiums like Open AP are making their targeting IDs comparable with Unified ID 2.0 as are some CTV owners directly, such as FUBO,” Martin said.', 'What’s more, Martin highlights the fact that its deal with Walmart adds shopper marketing total addressable market of $100 billion to TTD’s revenue in 2022, with the data integration still on track for completion in the fourth quarter of 2021.', 'It should be noted, though, that Walmart doesn’t pay TTD a revenue share, but rather, “TTD makes money from Walmart deal by attracting shopper marketing ad budget (TTD has ZERO of these today) from CGP advertisers that want to move products on shelves at Walmart.”', '“This is 100% a new TAM for TTD. TTD will charge its normal 20% take rate on this new revenue stream. Walmart is trying to mirror AMZN, which reported $7.3 billion of shopper marketing advantage revenues in Q2 2021,” Martin explained.', 'Achieving a 63% success rate and 26.2% average return per rating, Martin is ranked #130 out of over 7,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks.', 'Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch sees Plug Power as “leading the hydrogen ecosystem scale-up.” As such, the top analyst reiterated a Buy rating on the stock.

We believe expenses related to swapping out Air Products equipment in its hydrogen fuel supply chain as well as PLUG paying force majeure expenses builds strong customer loyalty and will help the company grow partnerships for hydrogen off-take agreements and vehicles,” Rusch said.', 'Leading up to the company’s Hydrogen Symposium, it revealed its estimated output and updated construction progress for the Rochester facility.', '“Leveraging automation, scale, and a seasoned leadership team, we believe PLUG can achieve significant product cost improvement at production scale. Management noted equipment is currently being installed, and expects to ship 250MW of electrolyzers out of the factory in 2021,” the analyst said.  ', 'Notably, this month, PLUG started working on its third green hydrogen plant, with this “expanding its reach to cover the majority of the eastern U.S./I-95 corridor,” said Rusch. As the combined production capacity will accelerate to 75 tons per day between the three plants, the analyst argues “this footprint provides critical scale for enabling commercial vehicle fuel cell adoption.”', 'Taking all of this into consideration, PLUG bumped up its guidance for FY21 gross billings from $475 million to $500 million, with the consensus estimate landing at $474 million.

Palmer said, “Now, VRRM’s Commercial Services segment is the primary driver of a reopening play that appears to be coming into sharper focus. The segment’s emphatic rebound during Q2 2021 enabled the company to post significant top- and bottom-line beats versus consensus estimates, spurring its stock price higher during today’s extended trading session. With management noting that the segment’s tolling volumes remained below pre-pandemic levels, the strong implication was that it would have ample room for additional upside as the pandemic’s impact on travel continues to abate.”', 'During the second quarter, the Commercial Services business delivered a surprisingly impressive performance. Revenue for the quarter came in at $66.5 million, a 144% gain from the year-ago quarter. In addition, adjusted EBITDA was almost $43 million, reflecting a 64% segment margin.', 'What was behind this strong showing? According to management, it was the recovery in leisure travel, which “arrived faster than they had anticipated due to the vaccine rollout and economic reopening as the reasons for the segment’s eye-popping results.”', 'Based on the solid second-quarter earnings results and favorable macro trends, the company brought back its full year 2021 financial guidance that was suspending due to the pandemic. Management is calling for total revenue of $510 million to $530 million, including the contribution from the Redflex acquisition, which closed in June.', 'Delivering a 66% success rate and 21.1% average return per rating, Palmer is among the top 150 analysts tracked by TipRanks.', 'Although Stifel analyst Scott Devitt sees a “minor marketing issue,” he thinks there is a “major market opportunity” for Poshmark.

Even though the analyst slightly reduced the price target from $50 to $48, the upside potential still lands at 75%.', 'In the most recent quarter, Poshmark posted GMV of $450 million, rising 25% year-over-year and beating Devitt’s $439 million call. Revenue clocked in at $81.8 million, also exceeding the analyst’s estimate of $81 million. Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA of $6.1 million easily beat Devitt’s $2.4 million forecast as marketing spend going into the quarter was lower-than-expected.', 'It should be noted that in the second quarter, changes to IDFA policy, which increased mobile advertising costs, affected the company. Management, however, believes these impacts will normalize throughout the rest of the year.', 'On top of this, Poshmark revealed that it is planning to expand its platform to India. Weighing in on this move, Devitt stated, “India is an attractive eCommerce growth market, with approximately 622 million active internet users and an increasingly active Gen Z and Millennial demographic, with strong resale momentum. On the call management continued to highlight international expansion as a key strategy to grow GMV and active users, and stated it will expand to new English-speaking countries (most likely the U.K., in our view) in the coming quarters.”', 'Reflecting another positive, Poshmark released a new integration within Snapchat called Poshmark Mini, enabling users to go to Posh Parties, shop Poshmark’s whole catalogue and engage with brands that have the most buzz on the platform.', 'The company also made several other improvements to the platform, including the addition of Style Tags to help with search, discovery and categorization as well as Price Suggester functionality to strengthen new seller efficacy.', 'The #34 best-performing analyst on Wall Street has achieved a 70% success rate and 34.8% average return per rating.

33,Chewy founder: We’re no Pets.com,2019-07-26T18:46:46+0000,"['In his most recent letter to investors, David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital wrote that today’s market bears resemblance to the tech bubble of 2000. He then compared Chewy, the company I founded in 2011 and ran as CEO until last year, to the ill-fated Pets.com.', 'I am no stranger to the Pets.com comparison. I heard it when I first started the business and again from nearly every venture capital firm I spoke with on Sandhill Road in Silicon Valley. After building Chewy for 8 years with a talented and dedicated management team, upon reading Einhorn’s comments I felt compelled to defend the business we built. The comparison to Pets.com is not only off-base but it does a great disservice to all the hard work the incredible people at Chewy have done over the years to build the world’s largest online pet retailer with more than 11 million loyal customers.', 'Since crashing and burning less than two years after its formation in 1999, Pets.com has served as the symbol for the capital markets’ excesses of the era. The company was fast growing, structurally unprofitable, and paid for sales by overspending on advertising.', 'Simply comparing the relative market capitalization and absolute cash burn does little without understanding the scale advantage, unit economics, and the inherent attractiveness of Chewy’s business model over its predecessor.', 'Mr. Einhorn’s primary complaint seems to be that Chewy is valued at 30 times what Pets.com was at its peak, claiming this as a reason for skepticism. He makes the point that in its heyday, Pets.com boasted a market capitalization of ~$400 million, which is dwarfed by Chewy’s more than $13 billion valuation, however these are useless metrics without context.', 'While Chewy’s current market cap is certainly more than 30 times that of Pets.com it also does 583 times more revenue, has positive gross margins, and boasts customer retention rates that outpace most software companies. While on a superficial level it is easy to draw parallels between the two highest profile online pet retailers, the reality is that Chewy is a fundamentally bigger, better and different business today than Pets.com ever was.', 'Chewy today is orders of magnitude larger than Pets.com, which allows it to leverage the high initial costs of shipping and fulfilling orders. Most people would find it futile to compare a company that did $6 million in revenue (like Pets.com) to one that eclipsed $3.5 billion last year. The importance of achieving scale in e-commerce cannot be overstated and is the first fundamental flaw in the comparison. Jeff Bezos explained this in Amazon’s 2000 letter to shareholders:', 'Online selling (relative to traditional retailing) is a scale business characterized by high fixed costs and relatively low variable costs. This makes it difficult to be a medium-sized e-commerce company. With a long enough financing runway, Pets.com and living.com may have been able to acquire enough customers to achieve the needed scale. But when the capital markets closed the door on financing Internet companies, these companies simply had no choice but to close their doors.', 'In order to make the necessary investments in its fixed costs – i.e. shipping and fulfillment infrastructure – an e-commerce company must grow fast enough that it can spread these high initial costs over a large enough revenue base. Unfortunately for Pets.com, the market wasn’t large enough to be viable at the time. In 2000 only 22% of Americans had ever made a purchase online and only 7% of Americans used the internet as a part of their routine product searches. The idea of buying anything online, let alone pet food, was a foreign concept to most consumers. This led to inefficient customer acquisition spending like $20 million on Super Bowl ads and a talking sock puppet, which never was able to move the needle fast enough for Pets.com to scale.', 'Internet companies today are doing billions in sales compared to millions of page visits 20 years ago. The rise of performance and direct marketing has reduced the friction in customer acquisition and allowed companies like Chewy to acquire customers more precisely and more cheaply than ever before.', 'The former Pets.com CEO, Julie Wainwright, explained the difference between then and now concisely in 2011:', 'Here is what the world looked like in 2000....there were no plug and play solutions for ecommerce/warehouse management and customer service that could scale...which means that we had to employ 40+ engineers. Cloud computing did not exist, which means that we had to have a server farm and several IT people to insure that the site did not go down. There were less than 250 Million worldwide Internet consumers in 2000- now there are 5 Billion. Amazon has reported a loss of nearly $900M in 1999...because guess what, ecommerce is a business of scale.', 'Since 2014, Chewy has grown from $200 million in sales to over $3.5 billion last year, now has over 11 million customers and purchases by existing customers represent 90% of revenue. The company has 7 distribution centers nationwide and can ship to 80% of the U.S. population overnight and almost 100% in two days. There’s no question that the fundamental barriers to scale exhibited in 2000 do not exist today, and that Chewy has been able to leverage its scale successfully over its history.', 'While Mr. Einhorn is correct in saying that Chewy has not been net profitable under GAAP standards, this obscures the core profitability of Chewy’s business. Between 2014 and 2018, the company burned only $134 million in free cash flow while growing revenue from $200 million to over $3.5 billion and spending approximately $750 million on marketing. Since inception, Chewy has had a positive gross margin and in the last three years the margin has expanded from 16.7% to over 20% in 2018.', 'While Mr. Einhorn may view marketing spending as throwing good money after bad, that is a misunderstanding of the lifetime value of a Chewy customer. By spending to acquire new customers, the company is deliberately depressing profitability of the existing customer base.', 'Given the underlying profitability and stickiness of existing customers, there was never a doubt that the marketing spend was yielding incremental returns above our hurdle rate. While the governor of growth has always been free cash flow, the lifetime value of customer acquisition was still above short-term profitability. Chewy could have been profitable years ago had we cut off the marketing spending, but it was a strategic decision to acquire and retain customers in order to maximize the long-term value of the business.', 'In Mr. Einhorn’s letter to his investors, he paraphrased Benjamin Graham in saying “Over the short-term the market is a voting machine and over the long-term it is a weighing machine.” I fundamentally agree with this quote, but not for the reasons it appears that Mr. Einhorn does. Just as the daily stock price is no indication of the quality of a business, the quarterly profitability of a company like Chewy has no bearing on the terminal value. We consistently chose to defer profitability in the short term in order to maximize shareholder value over the long term.', 'Value investing and entrepreneurialism are very much the same in the sense that they require contrarian decisions without immediate payback and run the risk of being misunderstood by the market for long periods of time. We’ve seen this playbook pay off for companies like Amazon and Netflix, but their success doesn’t make it any less nerve racking – especially when you have thousands of employees that depend on you for their job. Without conviction in the underlying economics of the business, I would have found it very hard to sleep at night if I thought our strategy wasn’t in the best interest of those employees, our millions of customers, or Chewy’s shareholders.', 'From day one, we chose to be a customer-obsessed business and replicate the experience of shopping in the neighborhood pet store. That meant focusing on bringing a human element to e-commerce and doing it at scale. Small touches like handwritten holiday cards and personalized pet portraits were ways we felt we could connect with customers and build loyalty over time.', 'While lots of companies talk about their flywheel, I truly believe that Chewy’s relationship with customers is the secret sauce. This is no more evident than in the fact that Chewy customers spend more with the company as time goes on – implying not only a level of trust but service and reliability. The net sales per active customer increased from $223 per year in 2012 to more than $334 in 2018.', 'All this to say that comparing Chewy to Pets.com is not only fundamentally incorrect but requires a deliberate misunderstanding of the evolution of e-commerce since the days of 1999-2001, as well as the importance of investing in the long-term viability of the business. While a quick glance may tell you that this business is no different than any other online pet retailer, ask any of Chewy’s customers and you’ll get a very different answer.', 'Even though I left Chewy last year, I’m extremely proud of the company and team we built. I urge investors to dig deeper into understanding the Chewy business and next time, let’s compare apples to apples. Times have changed.', 'Ryan Cohen is the founder and former CEO of e-commerce company Chewy, which went public in June.']"

But its lumber and indoor garden departments fell short compared with a year ago. Facing comparison to same-store sales growth of more than 50%, lumber fell negative this quarter. Indoor garden same-store sales were roughly flat.', 'A strong housing market has helped Home Depot and rival Lowe’s. Consumers have been investing more as home prices climb, increasing nearly 20% compared with a year ago. Demand for materials has been rising from home professionals, helping to offset lower demand from do-it-yourself projects. Home Depot holds a larger share of the professional market, although Lowe’s is trying to win more of that business.', 'Home Depot executives told analysts that professionals are still working through backlogs of projects as consumers feel comfortable having electricians, plumbers and contractors in their homes again. The retailer also recently relaunched its loyalty program for professionals, drawing more traffic to its mobile app in the hopes of convincing them to shop at Home Depot for all of their jobs.', 'This quarter, Home Depot’s customer transactions fell by 5.5% to 428.2 million. But consumers were spending more when they did visit, raising the average ticket by 12.9% to $82.38.

', 'The new space comes as Google appears to be bringing more hardware efforts in-house under executive Rick Osterloh, who oversees devices and services, including Nest, the Google Home smart speakers, its flagship Pixel smartphone, and the PixelBook laptops.

Yet from the start, it was clear the speech was about much more than cargo ships.', '“Today, I am here to talk about one of the most prescient economic concerns of the American people ... and that is getting prices down, No. 1,” Biden said at the start of his speech. “No. 2, making sure our stores are fully stocked. And No. 3, getting a lot of people back to work while tracking and tackling these two above challenges.”', 'Inflation and supply chain issues have plagued the U.S. economy for months, but new developments this week brought fresh urgency to Biden’s remarks.', 'The latest inflation figures, released Wednesday morning, showed prices last month rose at the fastest rate in more than 30 years, 6.2% over October 2020. The news sent sent shivers through Wall Street.', 'The inflation report followed new data released Tuesday about the billions of goods “out of stock” online as consumers begin shopping for the holidays.', '“Too many people remain unsettled about the economy, and we all know why,” Biden said in Baltimore. “They see higher prices. They go to the store or go online, they can’t find what they always want, and when they want it. We’re tracking these issues and trying to figure out how to tackle them head on.”', 'Complicating this one-two punch for consumers is that other economic metrics show the country in the midst of a stronger-than-expected recovery.', 'October job growth outpaced expectations by some 80,000 jobs, while unemployment fell to a Covid pandemic-era low of 4.6%. Wages have risen 4.9% over a year ago.', 'But while the recovery looks strong to economists, Biden warned Wednesday that it does not look so powerful for average Americans.', '“Everything from a gallon of gas to a loaf of bread costs more, and it’s worrisome even though wages are going up,” he said. “We still face challenges and we have to tackle them,” he said.', 'In reality, however, economists say there is little that Biden, or any president, can do to halt inflation. The roots of the current price increases lie in post-pandemic pent-up demand and global manufacturing issues.', 'Nonetheless, Republicans are eager to tie the current pandemic-related inflation and supply chain woes to Biden’s broader economic agenda – specifically his two major bills on infrastructure and social spending.', '“Our early focus on runaway inflation and the growing supply chain crisis is hitting home with voters,” wrote Indiana GOP Rep. Jim Banks in a recent memo to fellow Republicans. “We need to keep hammering away,” said Banks, who chairs the influential Republican Study Committee.', 'With few concrete options available to tackle inflation, the White House is focusing much of its energy on fixing delays at major ports and other tangible supply chain issues.', 'On Tuesday, the administration rolled out a series of steps it is taking to address cargo backlogs at major ports, including $4 billion worth of construction at coastal ports and inland waterways. This work, led by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, is slated to begin within 60 days.', 'Increasing the supply of goods on U.S. shelves is also expected to ease some of the pressure on prices.', 'Long term, Biden argues that his Build Back Better agenda will put downward pressure on inflation by increasing labor participation and overall productivity. But these long-term effects will take years to impact the economy.', 'Right now, however, the future effect of Biden’s agenda seems to matter little to voters who are struggling to deal with sky-rocketing food and fuel prices.', 'Only 42% of Americans approved of Biden’s job performance in an NBC News poll in late October. The same poll revealed that 71% of voters believed the country was headed in the wrong direction.', 'Still, Biden insisted Wednesday that the short-term impacts of his administration’s policies would soon pay off.', '“Thanks to those steps we’re taking, very soon we’re going to see the supply chain start catching up with demand,” he said. “So not only will we see more record-breaking job growth, we’ll see lower prices and faster deliveries as well.”']"

The company attributed the dip to a higher mix of Disney+ Hotstar subscribers compared with the prior-year quarter.', 'Disney’s average revenue per subscriber has shrunk in recent quarters because of the lower price points for its Disney+ and Hotstar bundle in Indonesia and India.

', 'The company’s parks, experiences and products segment produced positive operating income for the first time since the pandemic began last quarter and improved on those results during the most recent period.', 'All of Disney’s global theme parks were open during the fiscal fourth quarter and all of its cruise ships resumed sailing.

43,What the EU’s investigation of Amazon means for U.S. antitrust probes,2020-11-11T14:27:13+0000,"['Amazon is facing renewed pressure to answer questions about its use of third-party seller data after European Union regulators brought antitrust charges against the company. ', 'Europe’s top antitrust watchdog, the European Commission, accused Amazon on Tuesday of violating competition law by using nonpublic data it gathers from third-party merchants to unfairly compete against the smaller sellers. It also opened a second investigation into Amazon’s business practices related to the Prime label and the “Buy Box,” which offers customers a one-click button to add a product to their shopping cart.', 'Amazon rejected the European Commission’s accusations and said it supports thousands of businesses in Europe. ', 'If the European Commission finds that Amazon violated antitrust rules, the probe could provide new material to strengthen similar cases against Amazon in the U.S.', 'Congress and the Federal Trade Commission are also investigating Amazon’s treatment of third-party sellers. It’s unclear what the scope of the FTC’s investigation is, but the agency has been interviewing third-party sellers as part of the probe, Bloomberg reported in September. After a 16-month probe, the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee said last month that Amazon has monopoly power over third-party sellers.', 'Both investigations are in different stages. After publishing a sweeping report on the competitive practices of Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook, U.S. lawmakers are expected to introduce legislation based on their policy recommendations.', 'The EU hasn’t filed legal charges against Amazon, so it could be years before it announces any penalties. It could also reach a settlement with Amazon or drop the case altogether.', 'Regulators in Europe and the U.S. have objected to Amazon’s dual role as a marketplace operator and seller, arguing that this may foster anti-competitive conduct. ', 'They have pointed out that Amazon’s role as a marketplace service provider gives it privileged access to nonpublic third-party seller data, such as order volume history, shipping data and sellers’ past performance, that isn’t available to merchants. ', 'EU officials and Democrats in the House antitrust subcommittee share the view that this data from third-party sellers is used to inform Amazon’s first-party business decisions, such as what products to introduce and where to set the price. ', 'The insight “allows Amazon to focus its offers in the best-selling products across product categories and to adjust its offers in view of non-public data of competing sellers,” the EU said in a statement on Tuesday.', 'Similarly, the antitrust subcommittee’s investigation included testimony from third-party sellers who said their businesses were damaged when Amazon launched competing products. For example, one retired third-party merchant was forced to exit his seller business after Amazon allegedly copied his products, “down to the color palette,” undercut him on price and “took over the Buy Box for his listings, ‘killing his sales,’” the antitrust subcommittee said, citing an interview with the seller.', 'Amazon has long maintained that it doesn’t look at individual sellers’ data to build private-label products because doing so would violate internal policies. The company has acknowledged, however, that it may refer to aggregate data in the process of building its own products. ', 'Amazon has also rebutted regulators’ claims that it exploits its control over the Buy Box to give preferential treatment to its own products and those featured by sellers who use its logistics and delivery service, called Fulfillment By Amazon. The Buy Box refers to a section off to the side of a product page where sellers compete for their offers to be featured. ', 'Amazon has maintained that the Buy Box shows the offer it thinks customers will prefer, while factoring in things like price and delivery speed. At a July hearing in Congress, CEO Jeff Bezos acknowledged the Buy Box algorithm “indirectly” favors offers that can be shipped with Prime when determining which sellers are featured.', 'The House antitrust subcommittee probe and the EU investigation raised questions about third-party sellers’ ability to reach Prime users.', 'In the October report, U.S. lawmakers said they spoke to third-party sellers who feel they have “no choice” but to pay for Fulfillment by Amazon, which makes their products Prime eligible, in order to “maintain a favorable search result position, to reach Amazon’s more than 112 million Prime members, and to win the Buy Box.” ', 'Winning the Buy Box is crucial for third-party sellers products to be successful. The antitrust subcommittee estimated that roughly 80% of Amazon sales go through the Buy Box and “the percentage is even higher for mobile purchases.”', 'Prime members are also an important source of revenue for third-party sellers because they tend to generate more sales on Amazon’s marketplace than non-Prime users, the European Commission said. Prime members don’t just spend more money per purchase, but they also tend to shop on the site more frequently. ', 'With the EU and the U.S. questioning Amazon’s market power over sellers, it’s now up to Amazon to provide proof that it treats merchants fairly.', 'The company flatly disputed the House antitrust subcommittee’s findings, calling them “fringe notions.” Amazon can reply to the commission’s conclusions in writing or via an oral hearing.', '“The ball is in Amazon’s court to disprove these allegations,” said Shaoul Sussman, a legal fellow with the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit.', 'The EU and U.S. identified similar issues with Amazon’s treatment of sellers, but the potential penalties and remedies they could settle on are likely to be different.', 'Democratic staffers in the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust recommended a wide range of remedies, including forcing companies to prove mergers would not harm competition and splitting different business units. For Amazon, this could result in it spinning off the third-party marketplace from its core retail operations.', 'As for the FTC probe, Amazon could be hit with fines or the company could reach a settlement with the agency in which it agrees to certain business restrictions.', 'Similarly, the EU has a range of penalties it could propose, including a fine of up to 10% of Amazon’s annual global revenue, or up to $28 billion based on 2019 figures.', 'The EU could also propose behavioral remedies, which attempt to preserve competition by requiring the companies to refrain from certain business conduct. But behavioral remedies can be “hit or miss” in terms of effectiveness, since some companies may find it “more profitable to violate the remedy and just pay the fines if they’re found in violation again,” Sussman said.', 'The most aggressive tool in the EU’s arsenal would be to recommend a line of business separation, Sussman said. For Amazon, this might mean that the EU orders it to stop selling its private-label brands in Europe.', '“That type of decision won’t affect the U.S. or any other market where Amazon sells those goods, but they could say, if you’re transacting in Europe, you’re not allowed to be a brand owner or manufacturer and operator of the platform,” Sussman said.', 'Sussman and other antitrust experts said they remain skeptical of whether the U.S. will be successful in bringing a case against Amazon and even if antitrust officials do, the remedies are likely to be limited. By contrast, European regulators have stepped up their efforts to crack down on Big Tech companies like Facebook, Google and Apple in recent years, earning them the reputation of being more aggressive.', 'The U.S. and Europe have different approaches when evaluating whether a company is engaging in anti-competitive conduct.', 'U.S. antitrust law is centered on the consumer welfare standard, which relies heavily on increased prices as an indication of harm. That standard has been hard to apply to tech companies because many of the products and services offered are free, or low cost, in the case of Amazon.', 'In the U.S., a company like Amazon can argue that whatever harm it’s causing competitors is offset by any benefits to consumers, i.e. lower prices and greater selection, Sussman said.', 'That argument is harder to prove to European antitrust enforcers. The EU takes a wider view when determining whether a company’s business practices are anti-competitive, including harm to consumer choice, potential competitors and innovation.', 'As a result, it can be easier to bring an antitrust case in the EU than it is in the U.S., said New York University law professor Eleanor Fox. This is part of the reason why the U.S. is trying to catch up with EU regulators, Fox said, which have carried out a crackdown on U.S. tech giants including Google, Facebook and Apple.', '“That difference is what we’re struggling with and it’s why the U.S. has been so slow to make any claims at all,” Fox said.']"

45,"The used car boom is one of the hottest, and trickiest, coronavirus markets for consumers",2020-10-15T16:37:05+0000,"['For at least a few weeks during the worst of the Covid-19 shutdowns, ACV Auctions faced a challenge no start-up can be sure it can overcome: all of its core customers no longer allowed to be open for business. As car dealerships across the U.S. were put under lockdowns, the Buffalo, New York-based used car market technology company, which works with franchise and independent car dealers, was in a situation its CEO George Chamoun now recalls as “a bit scary.”', 'But like many pandemic surprise success stories, that period of uncertainty and existential crisis gave way to a boom in the buying and selling of used autos. By April and May, with a lack of new cars from auto plants able to hit dealer lots, and consumers more cautious about spending on big items, used car sales boomed. That has continued through the summer and fall: the past two months, August and September, posted the fastest rate of used car inventory turnover in the past six years, according to Edmunds.com data.', '“It wasn’t just a return back to pre-Covid,” Chamoun said at the CNBC Evolve virtual event on Thursday focused on middle market companies. “We’re selling higher units today than we were pre-Covid.”', 'In June, consulting firm AlixPartners estimated that due to the lockdowns, timeline to full auto factory restarts and a global consumer confidence decline, it expected a drop of 36 million new vehicle sales globally through 2022, compared to 2019 levels. In the U.S. market, it forecast a sales market for new cars lower by roughly 3.5 million vehicles year over year, with that outlook dependent on the recession not becoming prolonged. Automakers including GM have become more optimistic in commentary since the Q2 Covid-19 nadir, but even before Covid-19, the used car market was more than twice the size of the new car sales market.', 'Autonation and CarMax have been expanding their used car efforts, and their stocks have rebounded strongly from the Covid-19 stock market bottom in March. Carvana, which unlike ACV Auctions goes direct to consumers in selling used cars without dealers in the middle, has seen its stock increase from a $30 low point in March to over $200 today. Another online rival, Shift, is planning to soon go public soon through a special purpose acquisition company, which has become a prevalent way for private companies to IPO since the market began its recovery. Cars.com reported earnings on Thursday that sent its shares up 25%.', 'Overseas trends are similar, with private U.K.-based online car sales company Cazoo recently doubling its valuation.', 'The used car market in the U.S. is already estimated at 41 million units annually, and Chamoun says some of the changes triggered by the pandemic will continue to accelerate. The strength of consumers in the used car market shows that Americans continue to want to own vehicles, he says, whether to take kids to soccer or go to work. “Vehicles are the second highest-priced asset we as consumers purchase, so it’s really important and going to be important for the economy.”', 'ACV Auctions has 700 inspector teams and 100 regional managers working with car dealers across the U.S. to buy and sell used car inventory, and the company was forced to hire quickly as physical auctions became impossible for dealers during Covid-19 shutdowns.', 'Digital acceleration goals in the business world being compressed from years to months has been a major theme of the coronavirus economy across sectors, and in the auto sales market, more dealers are accepting the move to digital, Chamoun said, which is a major behavioral shift for the market.', 'Dealers have been going to physical auction locations for a long time, and business changes don’t take place all at once, Chamoun says, but when dealers suddenly could not go to a physical auction it shifted the behavior of dealers and has made more of the market willing to sell digitally, and bid on and buy vehicles online. “Both supply and demand are seeing an acceleration of dealers moving to digital,” Chamoun said. “We will see a more significant shift to digital over the next few years. It doesn’t mean cars won’t be in a physical location on a lot, but dealers will want to buy online and bid online,” he said.', 'The start-up, which became Buffalo’s first “unicorn” — a start-up valued at over $1 billion — in late 2019, has had to invent new technology tools to aid this shift in the used car market.', 'It built a tool to scan a car title and create electronic recognition of the documents so the title process could occur between buyers and sellers and ACV in a digital environment.', 'It also invented a way to scan the undercarriage of vehicle, called virtual lift, to take thousands of pictures of the undercarriage of cars as part of making the used car inspection process more transparent in a virtual environment.', 'And its AMP tool, for audio motor profile, can be attached to the engine of a used car and let both ACV and a dealer listen to the engine to make sure there are no potential issues.', 'During the first few weeks of the coronavirus shutdowns, Chamoun says his job was just trying to keep everyone calm since no one knew what would happen next with dealers or consumer sentiment. But that has changed. “What we really saw was strength.”', 'Online selling of cars is not entirely new. Speciality cars have been sold on platforms like eBay for years and dealerships have had the ability to sell cars online in a contactless experience, pre-Covid-19. But the pandemic has been a “next level” event, according to Edmunds.com senior manager of insights Ivan Drury. Some consumers will continue to want to interact in person and test drive up to as many as 10 cars, but the Carvana and CarMax models are taking the eBay specialty used car experience and making it more widespread for commuter cars.', '“These are Point A to Point B vehicles,” Drury said. “It’s a lasting trend. Will we see online sales grow at the level of Q2 2020? No. But at the same time it accelerated every dealership’s effort to really bolster up that part of the business.”', 'More consumers are interested in used cars in a weaker economy, and the new online models offer something that local dealers often can’t: a variety of models and custom features that can be shipped across states. “When it comes to availability and inventory and shipping across states, it’s been made so much easier,” Drury said. “There was such a drought in used vehicle inventory, even if I wanted to buy from a local dealer.”', 'The online experience also removes the “high-pressure situations” at dealers which many consumers prefer to avoid. “You control the flow online,” Drury said. That control advantage includes being able to break apart portions of the car buying and selling process, like trading in a current vehicle and adding it to the used car market. “You can do it online now and don’t have to trade in to a dealership. ... You can can see what the dealer will offer versus online, so there’s more control over each component,” he said.', 'But the auto consumer expert stressed that online businesses like Carvana and Shift Technologies remain small relative to the total size of the used auto market. Carvana sold a few hundred thousands units in all of 2019, and a little over 55,000 in the second quarter of 2020. That is in a used car market that is above 40 million units annually.', '“They are gaining traction and there is lots of market for them to transact on, but not everyone is doing it,” Drury said. He estimated Carvana and Shift combined sales at less than 1% of the market.', 'He also cautioned consumers about assuming that online companies are always the most competitive on price. The online competition is a good thing for consumer pricing options in general, but in some cases online sellers charge a premium for their service and inventory and shipping across states. That means consumers should always check to make sure the same vehicles are not available at a lower cost in a contactless online experience from a local dealership.', 'One reason prices rise is a limit on inventory, and there is a sector check on how much the used car market can grow even amid high demand. With 45% of new car sales relying on a trade-in as part of the financial equation, the used car market is linked to the overall sales environment for restocking of its inventory. At a time when consumers are buying less cars overall, the vehicles coming into the used inventory from rental agencies and dealer lease-ends are not enough to tilt the supply-demand balance.', '“Casting a wider net can help you get a better price,” said Brian Moody, executive editor at Autotrader.', 'He said the big issue right now in the used car market is the high demand. Prices have recently been rising on used cars, not going down over time, and that is something you rarely see in the market. Pricing has softened a little since the summer, but Moody said shoppers “shouldn’t go looking for deals.” Rather, they should be more focused on getting what they want. “I would shop around. ... but don’t be surprised if you end up having to pay more than expected for a specific car you want,” he said.', 'Many local dealers offering online sales do have virtual walkaround technology, test drives available at home, as well as delivery. They also have the advantage of offering access to a service department. “The local dealer is not completely out of the game,” he said.', 'Especially for consumers interested in recent models, between one and four years old, inventory will be stronger at dealers and they can offer you certified pre-owned vehicles, in some cases, at low APR financing as well.', '“People do want to buy cheaper cars but so many people are going for a lower price range there are fewer units out there and you have to get into older and older models to get cheap used cars,” Drury said. “Don’t discount the local dealer,” he added.  ', 'Even the auto experts are finding the current used car market a tough one to navigate in their personal consumer lives.', 'Drury was recently in the market for a used vehicle but ended up buying new because he said the prices were high on used cars he was interested in, and the incentives offered with the new vehicles were good. As the end of the calendar year nears, and 2021 models start showing up, prices on 2020 models may become even more attractive.', 'Buying a new car is always going to mean spending more, sacrificing as much as $12,000 to $15,000 in savings available on some used car models, but if a consumer’s budget is flexible, buying a new car can be the right decision. “I spent $10,000 more than I wanted to, but with the warranty and other benefits and new technology, it made more sense,” the Edmunds.com expert said. “There used to be a straightforward answer, but not right now.”   ', 'Autotrader’s Moody said his current car lease isn’t up for another year, and that’s a good thing in the current used car market. “I am relieved, relieved by the fact that I don’t have to make a decision in this tumultuous environment. People are paying more for used cars.”']"

Apple instead released new Apple Watches last month and pushed the iPhone announcement to October. The delay is an outgrowth of the Covid-19 pandemic, which disrupted electronics manufacturing and forced most Apple employees to work from home. ', 'Still, this year’s iPhone launch is significant. It is expected to include the first major exterior redesign since 2017, when Apple released the iPhone X with facial recognition. This year’s models will feature iPad-like edges with flatter sides, compared with the gently curving sides of the current iPhones. ', 'Apple is also expected to release four separate iPhones at different screen sizes and prices -- a much wider range of devices than in the past.', 'Finally, at least some new iPhones will support 5G cellular networks, which promise faster download times (although the networks aren’t fully built out yet in the U.S., which could disappoint some users.)', 'The last time Apple made such big changes to the iPhone was 2014, when the iPhone 6 came out with bigger screens and two different sizes. That prompted a major upgrade cycle -- a so-called “super-cycle” -- with over 231 million iPhones sold in the next four quarters. That remained the annual unit sales record until Apple stopped reporting unit sales in 2018.

That means the actual names, which are controlled by Apple product marketing in California, may end up being different.', 'Four models would be a dramatic expansion of its lineup, with both a new smaller option and a larger high-end option, giving consumers more choices and potentially spurring people to upgrade.', 'The phones are expected to be visually different from past years’ models, giving users another reason to upgrade.', 'In the spring, Apple released a $399 4.7-inch iPhone with a fingerprint sensor, the second-generation iPhone SE, this spring, which is expected to remain the least expensive iPhone after Tuesday’s launch.

Apple may continue selling these models -- typically, it knocks $100 off the price of last year’s models and keeps them on store shelves.', 'Apple’s tagline for the event is “Hi Speed,” a reference to the faster cellular speeds promised by 5G phones.', 'Investors and analysts have hoped for years that a 5G iPhone would represent a major upgrade and spur a big wave of sales not only for phone makers like Apple, but also for chip-makers like Qualcomm and carriers like Verizon and T-Mobile, which have bet big on 5G.', 'But some industry leaders are cautious. For instance, AT&T Communications CEO Jeff McElfresh told CNBC in September that he did not believe it would be a “massive event.”', 'Some of the impact may be blunted because there are three different varieties of 5G.', 'The biggest jump in speeds will come from the variety of 5G sometimes called millimeter wave or ultrawide band.

While carriers are expanding quickly, the new iPhones may only be able to reach their full potential in a handful of regions.

That may underwhelm consumers who have been looking for a massive improvement.

T-Mobile said this summer that it hoped to build its mid band network “over the next few years.”', '“Not all 5G is created equal, which has led to marketing noise from carriers regarding 5G performance and deployment,” Loup Ventures founder Gene Munster wrote in a newsletter in September. “In the end, both consumers and businesses are left unsure as to the timing of the 5G transformation.”', 'Consumers won’t know until Tuesday if Apple will support all three versions in all its phones, or if it will offer different models sold in different regions based on which countries have the most developed 5G networks. ', 'Apple CFO Luca Maestri said this summer that it expected iPhones to go on sale a “few weeks later” than the traditional September launch schedule.', 'It’s possible that some models will go on sale shortly after the event while others take a longer time to hit store shelves, most likely due to challenges designing and manufacturing ten of millions of devices during a global pandemic. Last year, ten days elapsed between the launch event and the first iPhones that went on sale.', '“It remains somewhat speculative when exactly iPhones will be available for sale after this event as Apple typically announces the first day of sale during the event,” Deutsche Bank analyst Jeriel Ong wrote in a note this past week.', 'Timing matters for investors because Apple’s first fiscal quarter has already started, kicking off on September 27. In past years, some new iPhone models have been on sale for the entire period, but this year that won’t be possible. ', 'The number of weeks in the quarter that the new iPhones are on sale could affect Apple’s performance in the critical holiday quarter, as people around the world buy iPhones and other products as holiday gifts.', 'iPhone timing can also suggest which models might be in short supply, which investors watch closely to try and predict average selling prices for the quarter, which affects revenue.', '“We also note that it is possible that certain models could either be more unit volume constrained or the new iPhone launch could be staggered similar to years past, although this possibility appears to be fading, as we have heard less about the potential for further delays recently,” Ong wrote. ', 'The invitation to Apple’s event suggests it will last two hours, which is a lot of time to discuss phones. In the past, the company has loved to tease “one more thing” at the end of its events before it introduces a whole new product category.', 'This year, it’s likely to be audio products. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted earlier this year that Apple is working on wireless over-the ear headphones that would carry its own brand (instead of Beats), and a smaller and less expensive HomePod speaker -- the current version costs $299.', 'Luxury headphones could entice buyers who have been turned off by the in-ear nature of Apple’s current AirPods but want closer wireless integration with the iPhone. ', 'A less expensive HomePod would make the product category more competitive with Amazon’s Alexa-powered speakers, which often cost less than $100.', 'Adding more credence to this possibility, Apple stopped selling third-party headphones and speakers on its online store earlier this month, mirroring moves made in past years before introducing new products. ', 'Apple said earlier this year that Mac computers with chips it designed would start to ship before the end of the year. Current Mac computers use Intel chips. But those computers are likely not going to be discussed on Tuesday, according to a report from Bloomberg. Instead, Apple could save that product for a November launch event, which would be Apple’s third of the fall.', 'In past years, Apple has only held one or two fall launch events. But this year’s launches are different — they’re prerecorded and held virtually due to the pandemic. There is also continuing appetite for Apple launches from customers, media, and fans.

The primary goal of the mission is to deploy two satellites in orbit for BlackSky.', 'Beck’s company wants to recover the boosters so it can launch more often, while also reducing the cost of each mission. ', 'But Rocket Lab’s approach to recovering its boosters is different from SpaceX, which uses the rocket’s engines to slow down during reentry and deploys wide legs to land on large pads.', 'Rocket Lab, instead, is testing a technology Beck calls an “aero thermal decelerator”—using the atmosphere to slow down the rocket. After reaching space, Rocket Lab’s onboard computer guides the booster through reentry—where it travels at up to eight times the speed of sound and is subject to heat in excess of 4,350 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'Then a parachute deploys from the top of the booster to slow it down and, like its first recovery in November, splash down in the Pacific Ocean. ', 'The splashdown is expected to occur about 400 miles from the launch site, where a Rocket Lab ship will then scoop it out of the water. Beck said this is the second of three planned splashdown recoveries, before the company moves to its full reuse plan: Plucking the booster with its parachute from the sky with a helicopter.', 'Rocket Lab is in the process of combining with Vector Acquisition, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), in a deal which values the space company at $4.1 billion. The merger is expected to close in the second quarter, when Rocket Lab will list on the Nasdaq and the SPAC’s shares, which currently trade under the ticker VACQ, will convert to RKLB as the combined company.', 'A SPAC is a shell company that’s set up to raise money via an initial public offering in order to merge with an existing private company and take it public.', 'Beck said the Electron booster for this next mission will feature a “beefed up heat shield,” as the heat shield on the prior recovery mission “took a real beating” during the intense reentry. ', 'Overall, the rocket booster “was in remarkable shape,” and the company now “understands the load” on the heat shield better, he added.', 'Beck said there will be one more major upgrade before the third splashdown recovery mission. ', 'The external changes are minimal, he noted, with most of the updates affecting “subtleties around control and managing the thermal load” on the booster.', 'Rocket Lab’s goal is to “do the minimum amount of refurbishment possible” with the boosters it recovers, so it can turn them around quickly between launches. The company is reusing parts from the first Electron booster it recovered, which is now “severely disassembled,” Beck said. ', 'While the booster took “a quick dunk in the saltwater for a few hours,” he said Rocket Lab has yet to find any lasting problems with parts that it plans to requalify and launch on other rockets.', 'Once the company completes all three splashdown tests this year, it will move to the mid-air recovery attempts. ', 'Rocket Lab demonstrated that it can catch a booster with a helicopter in a test last year, which Beck noted they did on the first try.', 'Rocket Lab’s Electron rocket has carried more than 100 small satellites to orbit over the past couple of years. The company has also built a spacecraft manufacturing business.', 'Beck’s company has launch facilities in New Zealand and Virginia. Rocket Lab’s first launch from the U.S. has been delayed by regulatory reviews and is not expected to be complete until later this year.', 'The additional launch facility will be key, as Rocket Lab last year said it had 26 missions booked for 2021. Having both facilities gives the company as many as 132 launch opportunities per year.', 'Last November, Beck said Rocket Lab was building Electron boosters in under 30 days, and told CNBC that the company is now down to 26 days—with its goal to get production to a rate of one rocket every 18 days.', 'Rocket Lab also unveiled plans for a second, larger rocket called Neutron to lift more payloads than its current Electron rocket. The launch marketplace is divided into three sections: small, medium and heavy lift. Neutron will target that medium section.', 'Neutron, which is expected to launch in 2024 for the first time, will stand at 131 feet tall and will be capable of carrying as much as 8,000 kilograms to low Earth orbit. Rocket Lab did not disclose how much Neutron is expected to cost per launch.', 'The company expects Neutron to cost about $200 million to develop. Its first launch will come from NASA’s Wallops flight facility in Virginia. Rocket Lab plans to build a Neutron-specific factory in the region.', 'Neutron will also have a reusable booster, but the new rocket will “land on an ocean platform” using a propulsive landing. Electron “was always designed to be really, really manufacturable rather than really, really reusable,” Beck said.', 'Musk, shortly after Rocket Lab unveiled its plan for Neutron, commented that the rocket “looks familiar” but is “nonetheless, the right move.” SpaceX conducted multiple short flight tests of prototypes as it perfected landing its Falcon 9 rocket booster, a route Beck isn’t sure Rocket Lab will take.', '“Whether or not we see the need for hop tests is really to be determined, but our kind of current baseline doesn’t have us doing that,” Beck said.']"

And they also question whether it’s  being driven by commercial interests, or Chinese geopolitics.', 'About a year from the scheduled completion of a $5.2  billion Panama Canal extension that will let  the existing waterway accommodate bigger ships, a Chinese  consortium and the Managua government have said that they began  work on a Nicaragua canal. ', 'Read More', '  Hong Kong Nicaragua Canal Development Investment (HKND) claims  that it will complete the megaproject in 2019. (A project  “groundbreaking” cited by media reports in December was actually  just the start of an access road to let through heavy  equipment.)', '  The Nicaragua Grand Canal is projected to cost $50 billion, and  HKND says it will be able to accommodate ships of up to 23,000  twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs, a measure equal to 20 feet by 8 feet by 8 feet of  cargo). That compares with the 13,000 TEUs that the Panama  Canal will be able to accommodate after its expansion. ', '  But the 173-mile Nicaragua canal project has generated criticism  and skepticism, and lots of it. Industry experts question the  level of demand for a second canal, its potential as a going  business concern and the possible environmental impact in what  is geologically unstable terrain. Many even doubt that the  project will go much further than its paper proposal. ', '  “The vision is very significant, but the reality is, a lot of  people, including myself, are very skeptical that this will  happen,” said Eric Farnsworth, vice president at  the Americas Society and Council of the Americas, a  group that promotes democracy and free trade. “There have been  over 70 attempts to build a canal in Nicaragua, but it hasn’t  happened.” ', ' Read MoreDoubts deepen over Chinese-backed  Nicaragua canal', '  Farnsworth cited Nicaragua’s geological instability, including  active volcanos and earthquakes, as one reason the Nicaraguan  canal was never built in the first place. In 1902, Panama beat out Nicaragua for the  American-built canal route, when the U.S. Senate voted for the  smaller, more southerly nation by a mere eight votes. The canal  played an important role in the recent U.S. West Coast ports strike, which forced some  vessels to use the Panama route to get their goods to the East  Coast.', '  Meanwhile, Nicaraguan farmers opposing the canal construction  have organized protests—some of which have become  violent—because it would expropriate their lands. Activists  have also voiced loud concerns over the canal’s environmental  impact, pointing out that it would require the dredging of Lake  Nicaragua, the largest freshwater lake in Central America and a critical water  source. ', '  Like Farnsworth, a large number of experts who spoke to CNBC  have more questions than answers about the project, but they all  agree on one thing: There’s not enough demand to justify a second  canal so close to the Panama Canal.', '  “I sincerely believe we don’t need another canal. I don’t think  there’s enough ship traffic to warrant the construction of  another canal,” said Bruce Carlton, president and CEO of the  National Industrial Transportation League, a shipping industry  advocacy group.', '  Nicaragua refutes that argument. Telémaco Talavera,  official spokesperson for the Nicaragua Grand Canal project, said  that there will be demand from world shippers for their very  largest vessels, which even the improved Panama Canal won’t be  able to accommodate.', ' Read MoreCrime on the high seas: The world’s  most pirated waters', '  “The Triple-E type of ships won’t be able to go through the  Panama Canal, but Nicaragua will permit the passage of these  ships,” Talavera told CNBC, in an interview which like several  for this story is translated from Spanish. “There will be a need  for world shippers to reduce time, costs and pollution, and that  will be an opportunity for Nicaragua and the rest of the region.”', 'The Triple-E that Talavera refers to is a  1,312-foot ship, the largest ship by length that is operated by  Maersk, the world’s largest container-shipping company by  capacity. But even Maersk cast doubt on the need for a Nicaragua  canal.', '  “It’s not something we have a demand for, and we’re not able, at  this point, to tell whether we will use it,” said Michael  Storgaard, senior press officer at Maersk. “It may be so heavily  priced that we may not use it. We don’t know anything right now.”', '  Moreover, most ports in the United States won’t be able to  accommodate the larger ships that the Nicaragua canal is hoping  to target, said Jean-Paul Rodrigue, a transportation expert at Hofstra University. He added that it would require a hugely  expensive investment for U.S. ports to gear up for those types of  ships.', '  “The shipping industry is bleeding,” Rodrigue said. “The current  volume is not conducive for this type of investment.”  The shipping industry took a hit during the financial crisis when  many economies’ growth stalled and trade volume decline.', '  Hong Kong-based HKND, which won the canal project on a  no-bid basis and was granted a 50-year, renewable concession to  run it, is betting on an industry comeback: “China  should be expected to again accelerate its own economic growth in  the coming decades, while many other countries will re-establish  more respectable growth rates than those experienced in recent  years,” the group says on its website.', '  But even a comeback in demand on a global basis doesn’t warrant  another canal in Central America, critics say. Any given waterway’s future traffic volume is a bet that depends on economic trends on literally a global scale.', '  “General demand may grow at a moderate rate, but not necessarily  in the canal route, and not necessarily in the product category  that would make the route profitable in terms of tolls,” said  Rodolfo Sabonge, a former marketing and development executive of  the Panama Canal Authority, who was in charge of analyzing demand  projections for the expansion project. ', 'Read More', '  Sabonge pointed out, for example, that Brazil has seen huge  economic growth in Latin America, but anything that ships to or from a point south of Recife, depends on the Cape of Good Hope as its route to or from the Pacific. ', '  The Panama Canal expansion began in 2007, adding a third set of  locks and doubling its waterway capacity. The current locks allow  the passage of up to 5,000 TEUs, but after the expansion is  completed, the canal will be able to handle the passage of ships  with up to 13,000 TEUs.', '  “We didn’t decide the size of the new locks arbitrarily. We  decided them based on a study of demand, and we chose the lock  size that made sense for the next 15 years,” he said of the  Panama’s Canal’s expansion. ', '  Nicaragua’s motivation for the canal is obvious. The Central  American country is the second-poorest country in the Americas,  after Haiti, with 42.5 percent of its population living in  poverty (2009). The project would generate 50,000 jobs during its  construction phase, and another 200,000 jobs once it is  in operation. Panama, a prosperous economy, with an economic  growth rate of 8.4 percent, is in many ways a reflection of what  Nicaragua could have been.

It will be a development process that will help us  get rid of our main enemy—poverty,” said Francisco  López, vice chancellor at the Universidad Central de  Nicaragua.

HKND has approval to build some of the  other elements even if it doesn’t build the canal  itself. ', '  The motivation for HKND is less clear, and the company did not  respond to CNBC’s repeated requests for comment.', '  Given the project’s expected costs of operation, the tolls  in the much larger Nicaragua Grand Canal would have to be considerably higher  than the tolls in the Panama Canal in order for  investors to benefit from the project.', ' Read MorePort slowdown costing small businesses  time and trust', '  The canal would need to generate an annual income of about $5  billion, explained Sabonge. But the  Panama Canal, with a transit of 13,482 ships, carrying 327  million tons, generates annual revenue of only about $2 billion,  according to 2014 figures. ', '  Naturally, the lack of an apparent financial feasibility has  raised questions about whether the Nicaragua Grand Canal is a commercial project for HKND—or a geopolitical project for  the Chinese government.', '  “If an investor doesn’t see that there’s a viable option, or  demand out there to make a profit, they wouldn’t make an  investment. That leaves the question of maybe it’s coming from  the government,” said Chang Qian Guan, a professor at the U.S.  Merchant Marine Academy. ', '  HKND and the Nicaragua government have both denied that the  Chinese government is involved. It’s worth noting as well that  Nicaragua and China don’t have formal diplomatic relations.  China, however, has expressed interest in the past in building a  railway across South America as an alternative to the Panama  Canal. Most Chinese imports to and from the region travel through Panama. ', '  Controlling that passage would be a boost to China’s commercial  security, something that Beijing has already  demonstrated—through its actions in the South China Sea, East China Sea, Africa and  elsewhere—is a political priority of the first order.', '  If Beijing is the project’s real sponsor, then its essentially  limitless pockets would mean big problems for Panama.', '  “If there are geopolitical interests behind the building of the  canal, and the investment returns do not matter, and nothing has  to be repaid, then the Panama Canal would be severely affected.  There is not enough demand for two canals,” Sabonge said. ', '  “But if the Nicaragua canal has to adhere to what any other  business has to, from an investment standpoint, I think the canal  wouldn’t be much of an impact for the Panama Canal,” he  said. “Based on investment requirements, the prices of the  Nicaragua canal would be very high, and the Panama Canal would be  able to maintain its profits and lower prices.” ']"

But Fairtrade’s research concluded the average cocoa farming household should be earning about $7,500 a year to cover their full cost of living.', '“Price matters,” David Finlay, senior supply chain manager at The Fairtrade Foundation, told CNBC in a phone call. “We see this price drop as problematic, not just because we think it will lead to reduced incomes for cocoa farmers, but because we think those lower incomes will exacerbate other social and environmental problems, like deforestation.”', 'Mars Wrigley, which makes M&Ms and Snickers bars, told CNBC in a statement that today’s supply chain was “not in line with our ambition that everyone — especially cocoa farmers — should have the opportunity to thrive.”', '“Through our Cocoa for Generations strategy, ongoing support for the LID, and disclosure of our progress publicly, we remain focused on the critical issues that need to be addressed for cocoa farming families to thrive and be sustainable,” a spokesperson said via email.', 'Meanwhile, confectionery giant Ferrero said it had been working to improve the livelihoods of farmers in the Ivory Coast for years, adding that its objective was “to build value chains and work to maintain them.”', 'Cadbury maker Mondelez International told CNBC it was committed to boosting farmer incomes, noting that it had developed and invested $400 million in sustainable cocoa sourcing program Cocoa Life.', 'A spokesperson for Nestlé told CNBC in an email that it began rolling out its cocoa sustainability program more than a decade ago. The company announced in September that it would implement new living income programs for farmers.', 'Meanwhile, Lindt & Sprüngli – which sources its West African cocoa beans from Ghana – told CNBC it had initiated a program in 2008 aimed at improving quality of life for farmers.']"

But, we have to take action now, together with our partners in the private sector, to reduce the backlogs that we’re facing,” he said. “Now that we have seen how vulnerable these lines of global commerce can be, we cannot go back to business as usual.”', 'Biden, alongside leaders from 14 other countries and the European Union, agreed to “foster greater international cooperation on near-term supply-chain disruptions,” according to a White House readout of the meeting. The leaders also plan to strengthen and diversify the entire supply-chain ecosystem from reliance on certain raw materials to manufacturing to shipping and distribution.', 'The world’s supply chain is continuing to bear the brunt of a relentless pandemic, surging consumer demand, labor shortages and overseas manufacturing delays, which has led to higher transportation costs and inflation.', 'In an effort to address the U.S.’s own supply-chain issues, Biden also announced the following domestic measures:', 'Earlier this month, the Biden administration unveiled a plan to run operations 24/7 at the California ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which account for 40% of sea freight entering the U.S.', 'Last week, the twin ports announced new fines on carriers at the nation’s busiest port complex in order to abate the intensifying logjam of cargo ships.', 'Once loaded off vessels, containers moved by trucks will have nine days before fines start accruing.

They and four additional people familiar with conditions there describe working through high heat, cold temperatures at night and smoky air during last year’s wildfires in Northern California.', 'Their disclosures highlight the difficult balance Tesla must strike as it ramps up production while trying to stem costs.', 'Tesla recently told shareholders that in the three months that ended June 30, it made 87,048 vehicles, including 72,531 Model 3s, the company’s lowest-priced sedan. Both were quarterly records. Tesla told shareholders to expect full-year deliveries this year to reach at least 360,000, and more than 250,000 of those are expected to be Model 3s.', 'Last year, Tesla conquered some “production hell” issues, as CEO Elon Musk called them. That included removing or repurposing conveyors and robots that didn’t work as planned, and figuring out how to build cars and battery packs with more manual labor.', 'This year, Tesla has been grappling with what could be described as “logistics hell.” It has had to deliver cars to customers in more points around the world than ever before. Tesla executives have said the company should be profitable in the second half of 2019.', 'A Tesla spokesperson said the anecdotes employees shared about work in the tent are “misleading and do not reflect our manufacturing practices or what it’s like to work at Tesla.”', 'The spokesperson said many of the shortcuts described by employees, such as using electrical tape during assembly, are not approved procedures, and that cars are rigorously inspected before shipping. Tesla also said many of the parts used in the Model 3 come with electrical tape on them from suppliers, and showed CNBC photographs of some factory-taped parts.', 'The company said its first-pass yields at the Fremont, California, plant are higher than ever — a measurement that indicates Tesla is producing good cars and is scrapping or reworking fewer units than it did historically.', 'Regarding working conditions in the tent, Tesla said, “We work hard to create a work environment that is as safe, fair and fun as possible, and it is incredibly important to us that employees look forward to coming to work every day. In fact, we have a large number of employees who request to work on GA4 based on what they hear from colleagues and what they have seen first-hand.”', 'Tesla assembles some of its Model 3s in a tent, known as GA4 (“general assembly 4”) in Fremont. Built in spring 2018, it was supposed to be a temporary measure. The idea was to run the tent mostly on manual labor while Tesla perfected its automated factory lines indoors in what’s called “the brick.” The tent has now been operating for more than a year.', 'Workers told CNBC that GA4 is now able to produce up to 120 cars per shift, across three shifts per day, amounting to 2,160 Model 3s in a perfect six-day week, or around 30,000 per quarter assuming maximum rates of production.', 'Tesla did not confirm these numbers, but in a statement last year, the company said GA4 was responsible for about 20% of total Model 3 production during a high-output week in July 2018.', 'While the tented line does not crank out the majority of Tesla’s Model 3s, it still adds significant volume. When Model 3 lines inside the Fremont factory go down, workers in the tent can stay productive. That’s important to Tesla, given its history of over-automation and missed targets.', 'In the tent, Model 3s are put together using manual labor and power tools, lifts and conveyors, but not with any of the sophisticated robotics Tesla uses on the indoor assembly lines. Workers say they do one process at their station repeatedly, usually walking along the line with the car until they’re done.', 'Carlos Aranda was a former lead production associate who worked in GA4. Correspondence shared with CNBC shows he resigned from Tesla on June 24, following months of medical leave stemming from injuries he says he sustained on the job. (Tesla claims he was fired for a Twitter post that went against its Workplace Violence Policy, but provided no record of the offending tweet prior to publication, and the separation papers Aranda shared with CNBC do not mention a tweet. After publication, Tesla pointed to a tweet in which Aranda said, “I am so sick of tesla giving me the run around. I am about to quit and burn them to the ground. With what i know i can put a big monkey wrench in the works.”)', 'His wife, Maggie Aranda, worked as a Model 3 production associate in another part of GA4. She says she was dismissed on June 11 for using her phone during a shift to book health appointments after an injury. Both the Arandas previously worked on indoor assembly lines at the factory.', 'Six current and former employees supported their accounts of work in GA4 but asked to remain unidentified.', 'These people said that while work in GA4 is physically demanding, many people like working there because the atmosphere is good and camaraderie is strong. They said they can listen to music while they work, with a supervisor’s approval, and don’t always have to wear a uniform.', 'At the same time, workers were encouraged to take shortcuts to hit their production goals in the tent, according to five people who work or worked there recently.', 'For example, when it’s cold in the tent, workers tend to break a high number of plastic brackets and housings that hold critical electronics in place inside of the Model 3, according to four of these people.', 'Rather than waiting for replenishment teams to deliver boxes of new plastic parts to their stations in GA4, they said, supervisors told workers to use vinyl electrical tape to make quick fixes. Carlos Aranda says he personally visited Walmart multiple times to buy the tape and other items for production associates.', 'For instance, this photo shows tape applied to a segment of a white plastic housing where it holds “triple cam” connections in place inside of a Model 3. The Arandas said the edge of this plastic housing piece would frequently crack during installation, and tape was often applied here to hold down the resulting, hinge-like flap.', 'Installed in the windshield of a Model 3, a “triple cam” holds three cameras that allow the vehicle to see the road, traffic lights, lane markings and obstacles ahead. If triple cam connections loosen or break, some of Tesla’s safety features — like Sentry mode, AutoPilot, automatic emergency braking or full self-driving — may fail, the Arandas said. The car should then give drivers an alert that AutoPilot is no longer engaged, and the car needs service.', 'Tesla said many of the parts they use in the Model 3 come with electrical tape on them from suppliers, and showed CNBC photographs of some factory-taped parts.', 'Current and former GA4 workers acknowledged this, too. However, they made a distinction — the GA4 workers use tape to fix housings or brackets with cracks or to stop parts from vibrating in the car if they aren’t snapped or fastened in perfectly. That’s not the same as “factory tape,” they said.', 'Factory tape is high-quality and looks as if it’s shrink-wrapped on a part, always in the same place. Much of it is wound carefully around bundles of cables and wires in a perfect spiral. The tape that workers would apply in a Model 3 typically has hastily cut or torn ends and varies in placement.', 'A Tesla spokesperson says the company hasn’t found evidence of electrical tape being used to make quick fixes in GA4, and would never officially condone or encourage it. The company also emphasized that its cars go through rigorous quality inspections before they leave the factory.', 'A former Tesla technician, who worked in the tent on Model 3s and asked to remain unidentified, analyzed photos from GA4 that were shared with CNBC by current and former employees.', 'This person said Tesla’s vehicle engineers would probably not appreciate that Model 3s were being assembled with this cheap vinyl electrical tape, and any processes allowing prodigious use of the tape during assembly should be reevaluated.', 'The technician also emphasized that the Tesla Model 3 is an ideal electric vehicle — as long as it’s built exactly to spec.', 'Workers say they took other short cuts to hit aggressive new production targets, too.', 'Five people who work or worked in the tent in 2019 said they would frequently pass cars down the line that they knew were missing a few bolts, nuts or lugs, all in the name of saving time.', 'In the tent, most workers have just a couple of minutes to complete a process. If a small item was missing, or a bolt was not torqued in perfectly, they would rather keep cars moving than stop the line and be seen as a bottleneck to production, they said.', 'In particular, these people said, aeroshields are often missing a middle bolt, and loose connections in body controllers are a common issue.', 'For example, this photo shows the power supply for a distribution block in the front right vehicle controller in a Model 3. A nut is missing that should be there to secure electrical connections.', 'Wires in this part of the car go to the touchscreen, car computer, door latches and window regulators on the right hand side of the Model 3, while the red cable distributes power into the systems on the right hand side.', 'Although it’s a low-voltage connection, if it’s not properly secured, it can heat up and cause problems, the former Tesla technician said. Model 3s with loose connections can be hard to detect during inspections, the ex-technician and factory workers said.', 'Tesla said the company “has a robust quality assurance team that reviews each vehicle at the end of the GA4 assembly line to ensure every car was built correctly and is perfect before it leaves our factory to go to customers.”', 'Current and former employees also said Tesla reduced “water testing” on cars as the company began ramping up production of Model 3s.', 'In a water test, a vehicle goes into a booth where jets blast it with water from all different directions. Any leaks in the seals are immediately found and fixed. The tests take about 10 minutes each.', 'In late 2018, Tesla changed its policy and now only conducts sample testing for water leaks on Model 3s.', 'Since then, if workers see an issue with the urethane seals around a Model 3 glass roof, for example, they can request a water test. But many in GA4 are hesitant to make that request because of time pressure and a lack of experience or training that they need to identify flaws, a current associate said.', 'A Tesla spokesperson said the company is not aware of any instances where workers were told not to do water testing because that may slow production. The company says it encourages employees to identify opportunities for improvement, and engage all appropriate teams to evaluate potential risks and identify possible solutions.', 'In addition, six current and prior employees said, workers often violated a rule that cars should only be driven in “factory mode,” which now limits speed to 10 mph. Workers would sneak freshly built Model 3s out of factory mode to zip them over to a camera calibration station (or “cam cal”), which was located far away from the GA4 tent. (That station has since been moved closer to the tent.)', 'Employees caught doing this would be appropriately disciplined, Tesla said.', 'Mike Ramsey, senior automotive research director at Gartner, said that even before Tesla put a Model 3 assembly line in a tent, it had a “ship-it-now, fix-it-later” mentality inspired by software patching.', 'Tesla’s focus, instead, has been to exceed expectations in other areas like brand, vehicle acceleration or charging, he said. While Tesla has been successful with those efforts, he said: “Every time a car rolls off the lot and a piece of trim falls off, or an electrical system is failing after a month, it undermines the brand. That customer is not likely to buy another Tesla.”', 'Ramsey also said, “The idea that you would not stop the line, and would patch something with spit and bailing wire — OK, not literally that, but close to it — almost certainly injects quality issues down the road that they are going to have to fix.”', 'Exposure to the elements in GA4 poses another problem for the workers.', 'Six current and recent Tesla employees said GA4 workers have repeatedly asked Tesla’s environmental health and safety teams to help with cold temperatures overnight, sweltering heat during the days, and pests — including mice and bugs — in the tent.', 'They say workers commonly deal with heat rash and heat exhaustion.', 'Tesla installed big fans in GA4 to distribute heat and circulate air. However they are not on consistently, these people said, and usually don’t make a big difference.', 'Tesla said its environmental health and safety team monitors temperatures to ensure they are within a comfortable range for the safety of employees, production equipment and car parts. They also said they provide temperature controls like cool fans, hydration, rest breaks and heat stress awareness training to employees.', 'Hot, dry conditions can also lead to problems with air quality.', 'Correspondence reviewed by CNBC shows that Tesla required GA4 workers to report for duty even as wildfire smoke floated up from the massive Camp Fire that devastated Northern California in November. On Nov. 9, the day after the Camp Fire ignited, the AirNow Air Quality Index rated Fremont at an “unhealthy” 165, and continued in the unhealthy range for at least another week.', 'Tesla did not proactively distribute respirator masks to GA4 workers in the first few days after the Camp Fire began. Workers had to request the masks, according to internal correspondence shared with CNBC. Inside the building portion of the factory they had HVAC and good air flow, but tent workers were stuck, said Maggie Aranda, and they did not get time off due to the smoke.', 'Tesla says it offered air filter masks who those who wanted them and provided face masks every day as a precautionary measure.', 'When conditions turn cold and wet, other problems arise. For instance, this photo shows rain seeping into the tented roof at GA4.', 'Employees wear layers, and big coats that can impede their movement. Supervisors distribute disposable hand-warming packets that workers slip into their gloves or tape to their bodies. Tesla provided big red jackets for GA4 workers last year, but stopped distributing them by early 2019, according to several current and former employees.', 'On cold nights early this year, workers in a tented “paint hospital” sometimes used heat lamps, which are used to dry paint and clear coat on cars, to warm their own bodies, according to current and former production associates. This paint hospital has since been moved indoors, according to public records with the city of Fremont.', 'At a GA4 station where employees checked Model 3 vehicle alignment, Carlos Aranda said, workers used space heaters in late 2018. But when it rained, water seeping into the tent from above and below made these a hazard, he said.', 'He shared photos of a leaking roof and space heater there, plugged in, with rain puddling nearby. Tesla says using space heaters is against company policy.', 'Pests are another problem. In the second quarter of 2019, Tesla employees said, mice chewed through wires and caused a conveyor breakdown in early May, delaying Model 3 production on at least one shift. Tesla said it has no record of this occurring.', 'A former physician’s assistant who worked at Tesla’s on-site clinic, Anna Watson, said: “It was general knowledge that the GA4 tent and North Paint were the most challenging places to work at Tesla,” during her brief tenure there in 2018. Another former Tesla HR employee confirmed this, and said the tent was seen as a place for tougher workers, or young blood.', 'Tesla offered the following statement in response to this story:', 'Tesla also noted that former employee Carlos Aranda tweeted in April that he had received a $207 donation with a comment “compliments of $TSLAQ” to a GoFundMe he started to cover losses from injuries he said he sustained on the job, which made it impossible for him to work. $TSLAQ is a shorthand term on Twitter used to describe investors who have shorted the stock.', 'Follow @CNBCtech on Twitter for the latest tech industry news.']"

As this plays out in numbers over the next few years, we suspect that RNG will get re-rated to an elite growth SaaS valuation.”', 'These efforts include its Glip product offering, which provides a standalone conference and collaboration application in addition to the messaging, video, phone (MVP) functionality.', 'Although the pandemic led to some churn in the SMB segment, management indicated that overall subscription revenue is expected to be relatively consistent. “With those headwinds likely abating in 2021, we see the revenue growth trajectory improving, where there’s also a significant opportunity to expand the existing MME base that’s only 15-20% penetrated within its employee base,” Peterson stated.', 'Landing among the top 20 best-performing analysts, Peterson boasts a 78% success rate and 36.6% average return per rating.', 'In a recent note outlining the firm’s top picks for 2021, Oppenheimer analyst Timothy Horan tells clients he’s bullish on T-Mobile’s growth prospects in the year ahead, with the analyst upgrading the rating from Hold to Buy.

However, he notes that the “execution has been seamless.” The company has already realized $1.2 billion in synergies in 2020, with the analyst estimating this figure will double next year.', 'It should be noted that T-Mobile owns 50% of the sub 6GHz spectrum, but it only controls 30% of the wireless market. This should even out with the C-Band auction, in Horan’s opinion, but this “will take several years and this spectrum is inferior to its 2.5GHz.”', '“TMUS is building the only true 5G network on 80MHz of this spectrum, giving it a two-year-or-so market advantage from a 10x improvement in speed.

59,How Adam Selipsky could make Amazon’s cloud business even bigger,2021-03-27T13:00:01+0000,"['Amazon Web Services chief Andy Jassy will take the CEO reins from Jeff Bezos later this year. So Jassy picked a person he trusts to replace him as the head of the Amazon unit providing cloud tools for hosting websites and applications.', 'Now it will be up to Adam Selipsky, who was Jassy’s right-hand man up until a few years ago when he left to become CEO of Tableau Software, to build on Amazon’s already impressive lead.', 'AWS controlled 47% of the cloud infrastructure market in the first half of 2020, according to estimates from industry observer IDC, more than the next four providers put together: Microsoft, Alibaba, Google and IBM.', 'Like Jassy, Selipsky saw AWS grow up and immerses himself in the details across many topics. As recently as 2016, when he gave up his position of vice president for sales, marketing and support, Selipsky sat in on Jassy’s back-to-back “chop” meetings to discuss proposals.', 'While Jassy was the last person to comment, Selipsky was second to last, said Jay Wampold, marketing chief of cloud-development start-up Pulumi and a former AWS product marketing director.', 'Amazon workers for decades have leaned on 14 leadership principles such as “customer obsession” and “bias for action.” People who know him said Selipsky embodied those principles, like Jassy. He’s also well acquainted with Amazon’s practice of coming up with fake press releases and frequently-asked-questions documents for potential products. It probably won’t take long for Selipsky to remember the rhythm of working at Amazon.', 'But one thing that distinguishes Selipsky from other candidates is that he ran analytics software company Tableau, both as a publicly traded company and as a part of Salesforce. Under Selipsky, Tableau’s stock rose as revenue growth accelerated and he led a shift from selling one-time software licenses to subscriptions. He then helped sell it to Salesforce in 2019 for $15.7 billion, which was the company’s biggest acquisition ever at the time.', '“More and more, organizations are demanding subscription purchasing options for all of their software, and data analytics is no different. It’s no surprise why, as with subscription, our customers get the full power and simplicity of Tableau with lower risk, lower upfront investment and more flexibility,” Selipsky told analysts on a 2017 conference call. The push succeeded: By 2019 84% of Tableau’s revenue came from subscriptions.', 'Leading Tableau gave Selipsky greater exposure to the complexities of selling software for non-technical users, said Jay Heglar, chief business officer of Tableau competitor Domo and formerly an AWS sales leader who worked with Selipsky. Now, Heglar said, Selipsky can go back and try to boost adoption of the cloud applications offered by AWS, which historically have not been as popular as its low-level computing, storage and database products.', 'For example, being at Tableau meant allying with resellers that can get software into large accounts, Heglar said. Selipsky could call for Amazon to refine its approach there to promote applications such as the Amazon Chime video-calling service -- which is far from a household name like Zoom, or even Skype.', 'Working at Salesforce might have given Selipsky some new perspective on how to make AWS even bigger. Salesforce spent four times as much on sales and marketing as on research and development in its last fiscal year, showing its emphasis on selling.', '“Make it easy to do business. Make it easy to buy a platform,” said Manny Medina, CEO of sales software start-up Outreach and member of the Amazon team that started what became AWS. “Sell me a vision. Good old salesmanship -- you need a little bit of Keith Block in that organization.” Block joined Salesforce from Oracle in 2013 and was elevated to co-CEO alongside Marc Benioff before he resigned in February 2020.', 'Medina said it would be helpful if AWS could sell customers technology even if it’s not quite available yet -- a sales tactic that Oracle has employed in the past. “If you want to grow, you have to make promises for things that you don’t yet have,” one former Oracle employee was quoted as saying.', 'Medina also said Selipsky could make a difference if he can make AWS simpler for users. This week a small cloud-infrastructure provider called DigitalOcean, which touts the simplicity of its services and billing practices, debuted on the New York Stock Exchange.', 'Selipsky will have to contend with a resurgent Microsoft.', 'When Selipsky left Amazon, Microsoft was still bolstering its portfolio with Azure services to match what Amazon could deliver, and Microsoft was still rolling out data centers around the world to boost capacity. Those are not big issues anymore. Microsoft has become more successful at convincing longtime Windows and Office customers to try Azure, in part by encouraging its salespeople to focus on getting customers to use it, instead of just pay for it.', 'Since 2016, Microsoft has also begun using Amazon’s own behavior against it. Microsoft executives regularly say that companies don’t want to do business with a IT services company that competes with them in other arenas -- a jab at Amazon’s continuous expansion from e-commerce into shipping, pharmacy, grocery stores and more.', 'Selipsky will have to respond to that line of inquiry, just as Jassy has. (Amazon has said that “for customers who’ve built meaningful offerings with significant functionality, we’ve yet to see these companies struggle to keep growing simply because AWS offers something in that area, too.”)', 'Whatever Microsoft is doing, it’s working. Azure now appears to be close to eclipsing Office as Microsoft’s largest business by revenue. IDC estimates indicate that AWS lost market share in the first half of 2021 compared with the first half of 2020, while Microsoft gained share. Alibaba and Google took share as well.', 'Microsoft has been assembling bundles of products and coming up with enhancements designed for individual industries, such as health care, manufacturing and retail. Amazon has not pursued a vertical-specific strategy to date. AWS has won some business in slow-moving areas, such as financial services and health care.', '“I do think there’s an opportunity for Adam to break through on some of that as part of a vertical strategy,” said Ed Anderson, a distinguished analyst at technology research company Gartner. For example, AWS could stand to capture more dollars from industries that have been slow to adopt the public cloud, such as financial services and health care.', 'His history at Salesforce will help here, too, as the company went deeper on its own industry push while Selipsky was there.', 'International expansion is another opportunity. Selipsky will be stepping into an Amazon that still isn’t always the go-to cloud outside the Americas. Alibaba remains dominant in China, and across Europe AWS has yet to become a big hit.', '“European companies tend to be a little more conservative and less open to disruption and change,” Anderson said. Europe has many smaller organizations that work with channel partners and like to continue to use products they’re familiar with, Anderson said.', 'There is also the matter of building up new relationships inside an ever-widening Amazon.', 'Since Selipsky left, Amazon’s headcount has more than doubled to about 1.3 million.', 'At least Selipsky will find familiar faces when he rejoins AWS in May. He was involved in many key business wins, including arrangements with Capital One and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, Heglar said. He was talented at growing leaders inside AWS and was willing to step in to defend his people in meetings when others were pushing back on their ideas, Heglar said. His daughter, Nina Selipsky, works at AWS as an executive content and program specialist.', 'Most importantly, Jassy trusts Selipsky.', '“He will let Adam do his thing,” Heglar said.', 'WATCH: Amazon names next AWS CEO as Adam Selipsky']"

The amended forecast is likely to reinforce the case for OPEC and allied non-OPEC producers, including Russia, to impose additional output cuts sooner rather than later. “The impact of the Coronavirus outbreak on China’s economy has added to the uncertainties surrounding global economic growth in 2020, and by extension global oil demand growth in 2020,” OPEC said in the report. — Meredith', 'Another 39 people have tested positive for the coronavirus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan, with one quarantine officer also infected, bringing the total to 175, the health ministry said.

After he gave the green light, Malek produced 2,500 face shields, and shipped the first boxes this week to hospitals that have asked for donations, including Children’s National in Washington, D.C. He’s put his business on the back burner for the moment to focus on PPE.', '“I had an epiphany, if our health-care workers start reducing in number it’s going to be catastrophic for everyone,” Malek said. “I realized I could have greater impact if I focused on the health-care pros on the frontline.”', 'Individual makers and small groups are mobilizing during this crisis because of a dire lack of PPE across the country, which has waves of doctors and nurses asking for help.', 'In California, officials stockpiled 21 million face masks for emergencies, but many of them were expired. California distributed the masks to frontline medical workers anyway. In New York City, the center of the outbreak in the United States, Mayor Bill DeBlasio said this week that New York has only enough N95 masks to last through the end of the week. The federal government is asking agencies that might have stashes of spare medical supplies to redistribute them to hospital staffs and emergency responders as the national stockpile runs low. ', 'Hospitals and governments have set up websites to take donations of PPE from the public, often asking for face shields specifically in addition to masks and gloves. Arash has an intake form on his website and he says he has been surprised by the number of medical workers asking for face shields. ', 'Face shields are gaining favor because they use materials that are easy to obtain and can be made quickly. At its most basic, a face shield is a piece of clear, non-porous plastic to protect health workers’ faces from coming into direct contact with saliva droplets that may contain the virus.', 'Face shields are supposed to be worn in conjunction with other PPE, like surgical or N95 masks, and can make them last longer. That means the shields don’t need to be made to strict medical-grade specifications.', '“The overall specifications to build those are not going to be as stringent as a face mask or respirator,”  said Dr. Sanjay Kurani, medical director at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center. ', 'Santa Clara Valley Medical Center worked with a Sunnyvale, California, nonprofit called Maker Nexus to create a face shield design that can be used at the hospital and reproduced in large quantities. The supplies are critical given that one COVID-19 patient might require doctors and nurses to use 30 sets of PPE per day on that patient alone, Kurani said. ', 'Santa Clara County in California was one of the first places in the U.S. to report community-spread coronavirus cases, and it’s been watching its PPE supplies closely. It’s under a shelter-in-place order until May 3 and there are currently 277 hospitalized patients in the county that are diagnosed with or suspected to have COVID-19.', 'The hospital has an infection prevention team evaluating PPE donations, and the staff appreciates the help. ', '“It has surprised us to the point where people are almost in tears that there are others supporting us and what’s happening while we’re socially distancing,” Kurani said. “To feel connected to the community this way is a huge morale booster.”', 'Maker Nexus typically provides machining tools for its members to fabricate new prototypes, but under shelter-in-place they’re using 3D-printing to produce face masks, and making the design public. Maker Nexus cofounder Jim Schrempp said that the effort from people with fabrication skills reminded him of WWII-era “victory gardens,” when the government encouraged people to grow their own food to help with supply.', '“Demand for PPE has ballooned, and the response is happening all over maker spaces,” Schrempp said, adding that if demand for face shields falls because there’s enough supply, there are additional ideas and requests for PPE that the organization would love to make. ', 'Getting help from medical professionals to optimize the face shields is a critical step in the process. Schrempp said that their design went through seven or eight iterations to make it safer, including lengthening the shield, limiting attachment points, and adding a top covering.', 'Organizations with greater capacity are mobilizing, too. Gustavo Fontana, an industrial designer who cofounded Fresco Design, said that he’s been working with a group called Ushield, which has found a factory in the Northeast that can produce as many as 100,000 face shields per day from readily available plastic. His first “pilot run” shipment of 4,200 shields went out to hospitals across the country this week.', '“Every day you can get an extra shield faster to a worker, it’s potentially lifesaving for that person,” Fontana said. ', 'Now, big firms with corporate expertise in supply chains and manufacturing are getting involved making face shields as well. Apple is making 1 million face shields per week, and its design comes with professionally made usage guidelines and assembly directions. Ford has donated face shields to Michigan hospitals as well as the New York police and fire departments. Nike is using materials originally intended for sneakers in its face shield design that’s being shipped to hospitals in Oregon. ', 'The little guys don’t mind the big companies joining in on the mobilization effort — to them, the point is to help out the health-care workers on the frontlines who are fighting the outbreak and incurring personal risk. In fact, many makers said, expensive techniques available to big firms such as injection molding could result in better shields at a large scale. ', '“People are expecting big companies like Apple to step up, and that’s great, but collectively we’re all in this together and everyone can do something,” Malek said. ']"

This holiday with Amazon will be different in many ways.  And it will be my last.', 'In December 1999, I left work most evenings – along with most of my colleagues from the half of a floor of Key Tower that housed the entire corporate operations team – to head to the Seattle Distribution Center to pack boxes and gift wrap presents.  We also traveled to our buildings in Nevada, Kentucky, and Kansas.  I always packed flannel shirts for these trips to colder parts of the country.  Our main purpose was to ensure we shipped all customer orders in time for the holiday.  But we benefitted in other ways from these visits.  We got to see how the physical operations connected to our digital store, and I got to personally inspect our safety culture.  We made new friends (and a few of these friendships led to marriages).  And, perhaps most importantly, we gained enormous respect for the dedication and customer focus of our fellow employees who worked away from headquarters.', 'A few years later – with the help of an operational excellence focus built on Lean, statistical process control, a clear understanding of our bottlenecks, and purpose-built software – we didn’t need to send corporate employees out to fulfillment centers (FCs) to add much-needed bandwidth supporting our associates.  Everyone cheered our improving operational capability, but I noticed something was lost.  Holiday conversations in our frugal, but comfortable, Seattle offices increasingly turned to holiday parties and eggnog, and away from the stories of FC heroics.  I didn’t hear the same sharing of respect for the work being done in our FCs, and I was committed to reconnecting corporate employees to operations.', 'We created Customer Connections so that every new employee spent time in an FC or Customer Service.  I doubled down on representing our Operations team in the corporate environment, including starting every meeting with a safety tip.  And I started to wear my flannel shirts every day of Q4.  The flannel gave me a chance to talk about our operations and remind everyone of how dedicated and customer-focused our colleagues in the field were, too.', 'COVID-19 has pulled me back to my roots in operations as I work with the teams building antigen testing capacity, which we’ll deploy first to our front-line employees.  I’m so proud of the dedication our people have shown as they pick, pack, ship, and deliver to hundreds of millions of customers around the world who depend on us.  These employees deserve every ounce of our attention to ensure their safety, which is why we’ve spent so much time and money to keep them healthy and safe.  This testing work is very much in the spirit of flannel, and is the latest example of our commitment to the people in our fulfillment centers.', 'I’m planning to retire in Q1 of next year.  I don’t have a new job, and am as happy with and proud of Amazon as ever.  I treasure the deep relationships we forged as we grew this company.  From Jeff Bezos and my S-team colleagues to the hundreds and hundreds of leaders throughout Amazon who apply our Leadership Principles every single day.  We worked hard.  And we had a blast.  So why leave?  It’s just time.  Time for Dave Clark to step in and lead the organization as CEO Worldwide Consumer.  Time for Russ Grandinetti and Doug Herrington to expand their already considerable influence on our company’s culture and performance.  Time for me to take time to explore personal interests that have taken a back seat for over two decades.', 'As part of this transition, we are also adding John Felton, Alicia Boler Davis, and Dave Treadwell to S-team.

He rose through the finance ranks to ultimately serve as the head of finance for Dave Clark’s WW Operations team.  In 2018, Dave asked John to jump from Finance to Operations.  He did so enthusiastically, first leading Global Customer Fulfillment, and now Global Delivery Services, which includes our hugely successful AMZL expansion.', 'While she was at General Motors, Alicia and I were introduced by a mutual friend and agreed to have lunch.  We hit it off right away.  I was so impressed with her leadership experience, technical acumen, and especially her dedication to the workers on the shop floor.  She wasn’t wearing flannel, but I was sure we shared the same instincts.  She’s off to a great start running Global Customer Fulfillment.', 'I met Dave Treadwell during our freshman year of college.  He was already way better at writing code than I was.  After spending nearly 30 years rising through the senior ranks at Microsoft, I asked him if he might consider joining Amazon. He was intrigued, and I jumped at the chance to hire him.  “Tread” has led our eCommerce Foundation tech teams since he joined Amazon, driving huge architectural change through Rolling Stone and our transition to native AWS, along with a significant improvement in our infrastructure costs.  Dave has an unusual mix of deep technical acumen and empathetic leadership, and he’ll be a great add to the S-team.', 'I didn’t hire Dave Clark.  Our MBA recruiting team brought him on board months before I joined.  But soon after my arrival at Amazon, I knew he was special.  He possessed a unique mix of raw intellect, systems thinking, sharp wit, and tons of leadership courage.  I tested him.  I “asked” him to go to Tokyo to start up our first Japanese FC (which he did after getting his first passport).  I “asked” him to go to Campbellsville, KY, to take a Senior Manager role.  I hoped that one day Dave might be my successor leading Operations, but I knew he would need significant plant leadership experience to complete his mental models.  After helping to dramatically improve the operations in Campbellsville, I asked him to take the General Manager role at our Delaware FC.  The operations there were relatively simple, so the leadership challenge was more about leading people than optimizing process.  Dave excelled again.  From there, Dave returned to Seattle to stay, assuming various roles in Operations that included designing our next generation FCs.  Seven years ago, he took over leadership of WW Operations and joined the S-team.  Dave thinks and leads boldly.  He’s the Big Thinking energy behind the scale of Amazon Robotics, our Prime Air fleet, and AMZL deliveries.  In the last two years, we moved Prime, Marketing, and the Stores organizations to Dave, giving him a chance to broaden his leadership beyond operations.  Dave is now ready to lead WW Consumer, and I’ll be proud to turn it over to him early next year.', 'We have an important holiday season ahead as customers will be depending on us more than ever.  We have so much to do in the coming months, so I’m not leaving yet.  After this holiday season, we’ll have time for Chime high fives and socially distant thank-yous and goodbyes, and I’ll cherish each of them.', 'Thank you for caring about our customers and about each other.

It has a deregulated power grid that lets customers choose between power providers, and crucially, its political leaders are very pro-crypto – dream conditions for a miner looking for a kind welcome and cheap energy sources.', '“You are going to see a dramatic shift over the next few months,” said Brandon Arvanaghi, previously a security engineer at crypto exchange Gemini. “We have governors like Greg Abbott in Texas who are promoting mining. It is going to become a real industry in the United States, which is going to be incredible.”', '2021 data for the global distribution of mining power is not yet available, but past estimates have shown that 65% to 75% of the world’s bitcoin mining happened in China – mostly in four Chinese provinces: Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Sichuan and Yunnan. Sichuan and Yunnan’s hydropower make them renewable energy meccas, while Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia are home to many of China’s coal plants.

After failing to meet Beijing’s climate targets, province leaders decided to give bitcoin miners two months to clear out, explicitly blaming its energy misses on crypto mines. ', 'Castle Island Ventures founding partner Nic Carter says that while it’s not totally clear how China will handle next steps, a phased rollout is likely. “It seems like we’re going from policy statement to actual implementation in relatively short order,” he said.', 'The way this exodus is measured is by looking at hashrate, an industry term used to describe the computing power of all miners in the bitcoin network.', '“Given the drop in hashrate, it appears likely that installations are being turned off throughout the country,” continued Carter, who also thinks that probably 50% to 60% of bitcoin’s entire hashrate will ultimately leave China.

Miners only require an internet connection, unlike other industries that must be relatively close to their end users.

', 'Because miners at scale compete in a low-margin industry, where their only variable cost is typically energy, they are incentivized to migrate to the world’s cheapest sources of power. ', '“Every Western mining host I know has had their phones ringing off the hook,” said Carter. “Chinese miners or miners that were domiciled in China are looking to Central Asia, Eastern Europe, the U.S. and Northern Europe.”', 'One likely destination is China’s next-door neighbor, Kazakhstan. The country’s coal mines provide a cheap and abundant energy supply. It also helps that Kazakhstan has a more lax attitude about building, which bodes well for miners who need to construct physical installations in a short period of time. ', 'Didar Bekbauov runs Xive, a company that provides hosting services to international miners. Xive also sells the specialized equipment needed for mining. ', 'Bekbauov says that he’s stopped counting the number of Chinese miners who have called him to ask about relocation options, ranging from operations with 15 rigs to thousands. ', '“One miner told us that only government electricity plants have restricted mining and private ones will continue to service miners,” Bekbauov told CNBC. ', '“But most of the electricity is generated by government power plants, so miners will have to move. That makes them uncertain and desperate to find other locations,” he said.', 'Whether Kazakhstan is a destination or simply a stopover on a longer migration west remains to be seen. ', 'Arvanaghi is bullish on North America and thinks the hashrate there will grow over the next few months.', '“Texas not only has the cheapest electricity in the U.S. but some of the cheapest in the globe,” he said. “It’s also very easy to start up a mining company ... if you have $30 million, $40 million, you can be a premier miner in the United States.”', 'Wyoming has also trended toward being pro-bitcoin and could be another mining destination, according to Arvanaghi.', 'There are, however, a few major limitations to the U.S. becoming a global mining destination.', 'For one, the lead time to build the actual physical infrastructure necessary to host miners is likely six to nine months, Carter told CNBC. “The U.S. probably can’t be as nimble as other countries in terms of onshoring these stray miners,” he said.', 'The move logistics may also prove difficult. There is a shipping container shortage, thanks to the tail winds of the Covid pandemic. ', 'But perhaps the biggest question is the reliability of the Texas power grid. A storm that devastated large swaths of the state in 2021 has reignited a debate over whether Texas should winter-proof its systems, a potentially costly project that might affect taxes or other fees for those looking to tap into the state’s power grid. More recently, ERCOT, the organization that operates Texas’ grid, asked consumers to conserve energy amid what officials called an unusual number of “forced generation outages” and an upcoming heat wave.', 'Tesla CEO Elon Musk has bashed bitcoin mining, claiming that it is bad for the environment. It’s not a new criticism.', 'For years, skeptics have maligned the world’s most popular digital token for polluting the planet, while supporters have extolled the virtues of bitcoin and its role in accelerating the rise of renewable energy. ', 'It is unclear whether the China mining exodus will make or break the case for bitcoin enthusiasts in the debate around the token’s carbon footprint. The dominant narrative, to date, has been that much of the world’s bitcoin is mined with Chinese goal. ', '“From a narrative perspective, it’s definitely an improvement,” said Carter. “But China also has the most abundant stranded hydro resources in the world.”', 'The country offers significant energy vectors from wind, solar and especially hydropower in the south. Xinjiang’s grid, for example, is 35% powered by wind and solar energy inputs.If all the miners do end up leaving China, it will mean less fossil fuel-powered mining, but it will also mean that the network’s share of renewable energy-powered mining will drop. This is why the question of where these migrant miners end up could prove critical to bitcoin’s future. “It’s the biggest story of the year for bitcoin,” said Carter. ', 'De La Torre says they’re looking to expand operations using green energy, a trend that is already years in the making. He says that hydro plants are generally cheaper than fossil fuels in most parts of the world.', '“Mining is price sensitive, so as to seek out the lowest cost power and the lowest cost power tends to be renewable because if you’re burning fossil fuels...it has extraction, refinement and transport costs,” explained Blockstream CEO Adam Back. ', 'Each year, investment bank Lazard releases a breakdown of energy costs by source. Its 2020 report shows that many of the most common renewable energy sources are either equal to or less expensive than conventional energy sources like coal and gas. And the cost of renewable power keeps going down.', 'But there are limitations to running crypto mines purely on renewable energy.', 'Though solar and wind are now the world’s least expensive energy sources, both power supplies face limitations at scale, so there is concern over the viability of miners turning exclusively to wind or solar energy.', 'For the time being, there isn’t that much mining capacity worldwide that is ready to absorb the Chinese miner diaspora. While they scramble to find a new home, we could see hashrate go offline – and stay offline. ', 'In practice, that would mean all the remaining miners are more profitable for a period of time. ', 'Having more geographic dispersion would even out the global balance of power, and it would also reduce the ability of any one sovereign nation to co-opt or control the network.', 'We may also see special crypto economic zones pop up in the next few months.', '“You will see jurisdictions adopting a very favorable stance and creating the equivalent of special zones to encourage miners to host locally,” said Carter. “We’re seeing it at the state level here. You’re also going to see it at the country level, you might even see subsidized electricity for mining.”', 'Correction: A storm devastated large swaths of Texas in 2021.

Now companies on both sides of the Pacific are trying to develop strategies to mitigate risk — whether it’s hoarding supplies or looking at shifting the location of production facilities.', ' Last week Trump administration announced that it is considering imposing export restrictions on Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, China’s largest manufacturer of semiconductors. That’s the latest crackdown by Washington as it tightens restrictions against Chinese tech companies such as Huawei, preventing them from obtaining chips without a special license.', 'The issue prompted SEMI, an industry group, to draft a letter for Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross explaining how blacklisting SMIC could hurt the U.S. tech industry, Reuters has reported. “We urge the Department to carefully consider the immediate and long-term detrimental impacts to U.S. industry, economic and national security that may result from the addition of SMIC to the Entity List,” said the group, which has 2,400 members worldwide, including SMIC and U.S. chip equipment makers Lam Research Corp  and Applied Materials.', 'While some U.S. firms such as Intel and Micron Technology still make chips in the United States, the industry’s center of gravity has shifted to Asia, where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) has more than half of the overall market for contract manufacturing chips and an even stronger hold on the most advanced chips. Firms, including iPhone maker Apple, Qualcomm and Nvidia all rely on TSMC and other Asian foundries to manufacture their chips.', 'Untangling the global supply chain in this interconnected industry is not feasible – at least in the foreseeable future, industry experts concur. Components for a chip could travel more than 25,000 miles before completion and can cross borders more than 70 times before a final product is delivered to the end customer, explains Syed Alam, Accenture’s global semiconductor practice lead.', 'Industry sources believe the best way to address the issue is to bring back more domestic manufacturing, develop a robust industry ecosystem, invest more in R&D and maintain America’s lead in advanced product design. An amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act shows Washington recognizes that boosting domestic manufacturing and R&D is key for national security and global competitiveness. The U.S. share of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity has been cut in half to just 12% over the past 20 years and is forecast to fall to 10% by 2023. ', 'The amendment was a compromised version of two bills that have bipartisan support. The CHIPS for America Act which stands for “Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors,” creates a 40% investment tax credit for semiconductor equipment, a $10 billion fund to match any chip manufacturing incentive programs at the state level, and $12 billion in R&D funding to be allocated over the next five to 10 years.', 'In addition, it provides support for semiconductor-based research grants to U.S. universities or private companies, either directly or through agencies like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). It also calls for the creation of a National Semiconductor Technology Center, which could serve as a clearinghouse and organizational control point for U.S.-based chip manufacturing, as well as a critical new research and development facility.', 'The other bill was the American Foundries Act, which authorizes the Department of Commerce to offer $15 billion in grants to states to assist in  the construction, expansion, or modernization of microelectronics fabrication, assembly, test, advanced packaging, or advanced research and development facilities. It also would give $5 billion in federal investments to promote semiconductor research at the Department of Defense, National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The bill also mandates that the White House Office of Science and Technology, in coordination with federal research agencies and the private sector, develop a plan to guide funding for advancing next-generation semiconductors.', '“We believe these grants and incentives are critical for the U.S. semiconductor industry especially for state-of-the-art advanced technology,” says Jeff Rittener, chief government affairs office at Intel. “We need help from the U.S. government to create a level playing field.” As he explains over time U.S. manufacturing stateside has been shrinking and that puts the country at risk since America will be reliant on foreign sources on the brains that run modern technology.', 'These incentives are key considering chip factories can cost up to $15 billion to build, with much of the expense in the form of pricey tools. China and many other countries have spent billions of dollars bolstering their domestic chip manufacturing industry and they offer tax and financial incentives to lure foreign manufacturers. In the Made in China 2025 Plan, the Chinese government has committed $120 billion to shore up domestic semiconductor manufacturing with the goal of producing 70% of all chips need for local consumption.', 'According to a recent report from the Semiconductor Industry Association in partnership with the Boston Consulting Group,  robust federal incentives valued at $50 billion would create as many as 19 major semiconductor manufacturing facilities and 70,000 high-paying jobs in the U.S. over the next 10 years. Strengthening U.S. chip manufacturing will help ensure America out-innovates the world in the strategic technologies of the future — AI, 5G, quantum computing — that will determine global economic and military leadership for decades to come. ', '“The country that leads in advanced chip research, design, and manufacturing will have a big leg up in the global race to deploy new game-changing technologies, such as 5G, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing,” said John Neuffer, president and CEO of the Semiconductor Industry Association. “Leaders in Washington should seize this opportunity, level the global playing field to attract chip production, and invest boldly in domestic manufacturing incentives and research initiatives that will strengthen U.S. tech leadership for decades to come.” ', '“The U.S. has always had a tremendous lead in thought leadership and intellectual property in the semiconductor industry but now China poses a real threat since they are subsidizing a tremendous amount in R&D,” says Bob O’Donnell, president and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research. Chinese government is currently making aggressive subsidized investments in building over 60 semiconductor manufacturing plants (commonly called foundries or “fabs”, which is short for fabrication sites).', 'Some companies are mulling over how to expand operations in the U.S. According to Rittener, Intel is investing in expanding at its locations in the U.S.  It has hired 3,000 new employees and is getting ready to open a new microprocessor plant in Chandler, Arizona.', '“Intel has also had conversations with the U.S. government about developing a foundry for advanced semiconductors,” Rittener says, “but there are no concrete plans yet.”', 'Other industry titans have already taken action. In May, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. – a big supplier for Apple and Huawei -- announced it was investing $12 billion to build  a second U.S. manufacturing plant in Arizona. The factory will be focused on producing so-called 5-nanometer chips, the latest in semiconductor technology being manufactured today. Construction will begin next year;  it’s expected to be operational in 2024.', 'For Huawei, the world’s biggest smartphone maker, the trade war has taken a toll. The company, which bought $20.8 billion worth of chips last year, has been hoarding chip supplies because of U.S. sanctions and gradually shifting design and chip production to mainland China.', 'The U.S. has accused Huawei of building backdoors into network infrastructure, ostensibly to aid Chinese government spying efforts, which Huawei has denied. Despite those denials, the Trump administration placed Huawei and 114 of its affiliates on its Entity List in May 2019, which meant US firms were unable to sell technology to the company without explicit US government approval. Since then the entity list has grown to include 150 companies. in May, the US Commerce Department issued an amended export rule to block shipments of semiconductors to Huawei to “strategically target Huawei’s acquisition of semiconductors that are the direct product of certain US software and technology.”', 'That rule prevented foreign manufacturers of semiconductors who use American software and technology in their operations from shipping their products to Huawei unless they first obtained a license from the US. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world, reportedly halted orders for Huawei’s HiSilicon unit in May following the new U.S. rule.', 'Now industry observers worry about any retailiation from China. “Given such sanctions significantly impact Huawei, there could be retaliation from China,” said Sebastian Hou at CLSA, according to Ars Technica. He named Apple, Huawei’s competitor in the smartphone market, and Qualcomm as potential targets.', 'Others industry titans continue to diversify operations in other parts of the globe. Last week, Nvidia announced a $40 billion deal to buy Arm Holdings from SoftBank. Arm designs the architecture for mobile chips used in almost every mobile device in the world, from the Apple iPhone to just practically every Android device. For Nvidia, whose chips are widely used to support graphics and artificial intelligence applications, including for self-driving vehicles, the deal will help boost its data center business.', 'While large manufacturers have the financial wherewithal and industry connections to navigate through disruptions in the supply chain, many small and mid-size tech manufacturers in the U.S. do not.', 'One is Social Mobile, a Miami-based consultancy and OEM that specializes in making customized Android Enterprise devices for Fortune 500 companies. The company, which also has operations in San Francisco, Hong Kong and Shenzhen, China, started seeing disruptions from suppliers in February and the situation is getting worse.', ' “There has been a shakeup in the industry,”  says CEO Robert Morco. “There are longer lead times for procuring semiconductors and prices have also risen. In some cases it takes double the time to get supplies. Some suppliers are only making them available for key clients. That has forced many companies to go to the grey market for chips.”', 'According to Morcos, “the big guns will get through this, but it’s harder for small and medium-sized businesses. We are feeling the impact of this trend the most. We are the ones that are being affected by a lack of transparency, price gauging and the lack of product availability.”', 'To navigate the crisis, Morcos says Social Mobile is asking customers to place orders early due to delays. Looking ahead the company is looking at building a plant in the U.S. with some sort of government support. “There is a lot of local, state and federal interest in onshoring semiconductor manufacturing right now, so we feel we are in the right place at the right time,” says Morcos.', 'O’Donnell notes that many of his clients are looking at U.S.-China trade and geopolitical tensions and its making semiconductor companies nervous. “There is a lot of saber-rattling going on right now between China and Taiwan,” he notes.', '“This has tech companies in many industries rethinking their semiconductor roadmap,” says Alam. As he explains, the U.S. just doesn’t need to build more chip plants, it needs to build an entire semiconductor ecosystem and attract the talent it needs to maintain the industry’s competitive edge.', '“It would be great to bring more manufacturing home,” says Gene Sheridan, CEO of Navitas Semiconductor, a start-up in El Segundo, California, that manufactures next-generation gallium nitride power chips in Taiwan and the Philippines for companies like Lenovo, AUKEY and Anker.', '“Trade tensions as well as the pandemic reminds us of the inherent risk of manufacturing mostly abroad.”', ' ', ' ']"

Those services will be under a new division of the company called Walgreens Health.', '“This new Walgreens Health will make a difference and will began to transform us away from retail and just dispensing pharmaceuticals,” she said in an interview with CNBC’s Bertha Coombs. “It will be about the lives that we manage, and the lives that we touch and the lives that we can wrap physician and clinicians around in our buildings, both physically and digitally.”', 'Investors appeared receptive to Walgreens’ plan. Shares closed up 7.4% at $50.77 on Thursday. So far this year, shares are up more than 29%.', 'Brian Tanquilut, an equity research analyst for Jefferies, said Walgreens delivered on what many investors wanted Thursday by spelling out how it will become a proactive health-care player.', '“Right now, people are saying, ‘It’s a sound strategy and we’ll give you a little bit of credit for that’” he said.', 'Walgreen’s plan calls for opening hundreds of primary care clinics, shaking up its selection of front-of-store merchandise and taking a stake in several health-care companies.', 'The company expects that strategy to pay off in the coming years. Next year, adjusted earnings per share are expected to show flat growth on a constant currency basis, it said. But growth will accelerate so that adjusted earnings per share will rise about 4% annually over the next three years. Beyond fiscal 2024, the company’s growth algorithm will lead to adjusted earnings per share growth of between 11% and 13%.', 'Brewer pointed to the company’s fourth-quarter earnings as evidence that Walgreens is building on a firm foundation.', 'Tanquilut said the new vision for Walgreens is a notable pivot.', '“You are making the pharmacy a health center,” he said. “Instead of having a retail focus, the driver of value is no longer driving scripts [prescriptions] out of the pharmacy. It’s actually delivering care and making the patient loyal to the store.”', 'It recently decided to invest an additional $5.2 billion in VillageMD, a primary care company that will run clinics inside of Walgreens stores and is on track to go public in 2022. It also acquired a majority stake in home health-care company, CareCentrix, and specialty pharmacy company, Shields Health Solutions.', 'Along with ramping up on health-care services, Walgreens will step up its cost savings goal to $3.3 billion by 2024. It decided to raise that goal after shaving off $2 billion in costs, Chief Financial Officer James Kehoe said.', 'Brewer stepped into the top leadership role of Walgreens in mid-March after serving as chief operating officer of Starbucks and CEO of Walmart-owned Sam’s Club.', 'She said for her, the health-care mission is personal. At the company’s investor day, she recalled the final months of her mother’s life, when her family juggled medical bills, numerous doctors and kidney dialysis appointments. The experience, she said, was “incredibly confusing and unwieldly and burdensome.”', 'She said that distracted her family from what should have been the focus: enjoying the remaining time she had with her mom.', 'For so many Americans, she said that is the same experience — and one that Walgreens aims to solve by weaving together primary care with pharmacies and freeing up more of employees’ time to help patients.', 'Over the next few years, Walgreens leaders say consumers will start to see and feel the difference when they walk into neighborhood stores.', 'Walgreens said it will have 85 primary-care clinics in stores by the end of the year. They will be under the name Village Medical at Walgreens. It plans to have at least 600 of the doctor offices in more than 30 U.S. markets by 2025 and 1,000 by 2027. More than half of them will be in parts of the country that are medically underserved.', 'In some stores and online, it will add Walgreens Health Corners. The in-store spaces will be staffed by medical professionals, such as nurses and pharmacists, who can consult with patients and help them manage chronic conditions.', 'So far, Walgreens has opened 40 of them. It plans to have more than 100 by the end of this fiscal year and to ultimately have more than 3,000 across its stores.  ', 'Customers will be able to get other kinds of medical tests, such as for pneumonia, strep, HIV and sexually transmitted infections, Walgreens President John Standley said. He said the company already has pilots, including a testing pilot for HIV in two states that it expects to grow to $26 million in revenue by fiscal year 2024.', 'To free up pharmacists’ time to answer customer questions, administer vaccinations and give other medical tests, Walgreens is opening centralized centers that fill prescriptions and ship them to stores and people’s homes, Standley said. It already has two centers open in Dallas and Phoenix and plans to open an additional nine by the end of fiscal year 2022, which will bring the number of pharmacies served to around 3,900.', 'In the front of the store, the company’s merchandise will have “more a spin towards healthy for you,” Brewer said in a CNBC interview. Already, she said, Walgreens has seen consumers gravitate on their own toward supplements and beauty products with a wellness bent. She said it will add more private label products, too.', 'She said Walgreens will take a hard look at tobacco sales. It has continued to sell cigarettes, even after rival CVS Health dropped the products in 2014.', 'With the strategy, Walgreens is following a similar path as rival CVS Health — but with a major caveat. CVS is an insurance provider, too. It acquired Aetna in 2018 in a $69 billion merger. It also owns one of the largest pharmacy benefits managers, Caremark.', 'CVS has expanded the health-care services it offers in drugstores by opening urgent care centers called MinuteClinics. It is turning hundreds of its stores into HealthHubs where people can meet with a therapist, participate in a yoga class or get help managing their diabetes.', 'Jefferies’ Tanquilut said CVS has a more holistic health strategy with Caremark, Aetna and its stores. That leads to natural synergies, he said, such as encouraging Aetna members to go to MinuteClinic for flu shots or urgent care. Plus, he said, CVS has a “first mover advantage” with turning stores into health-care destinations.', 'He has a hold rating for Walgreens shares with a price target of $53, roughly 5% above where shares are currently trading. He has a buy rating for CVS shares with a price target of $95, about 12% higher than where shares are currently trading.', 'On Thursday, Kehoe said Walgreens’ lack of an insurance company can work to its advantage. He said the company is payer agnostic and solely focused on improving health outcomes. Plus, he said Walgreens will have full-fledged primary-care clinics, not the more limited services that MinuteClinic provides.', 'So far, Walgreens has struck deals with Clover Health, a Medicare insurance start-up, and Blue Shield of California to provide health-care services for their more than 2 million members.', 'A.J. Rice, a equity research analyst for health-care services at Credit Suisse, said Walgreens hopes that by “being Switzerland,” insurers will see it as a “partner of choice.”', 'He said CVS and Walgreens both have a big opportunity to turn retail pharmacies into community touchpoints for health care.

In the United Kingdom, Boots stores have become known for their wide selection of premium makeup and beauty brands. Kehoe said store traffic has picked up again as the country lifted pandemic restrictions, making people feel more comfortable to browse aisles and socialize.', 'Some of Walgreen’s beauty brands, No. 7 and Soap & Glory, are now carried by major U.S. retailers, including Target, Ulta Beauty and Walmart. Those brands are currently a $750 million business and are expected to grow to $1 billion, Kehoe said.', 'Credit Suisse’s Rice said Walgreens leaders also hinted at reevaluating some of the businesses that the company owns.

78,Former Chewy CEO tries to push GameStop to become the Amazon of the video-game industry,2020-11-21T13:00:01+0000,"['The shift away from brick-and-mortar retailers in favor of online shopping has hurt GameStop over the past decade, pushing the company’s stock down nearly 40% in that time period.', 'But Ryan Cohen, the former CEO of Chewy, thinks the maligned video-fame retailer can turn itself around by shifting its focus away from physical stores in favor of a building robust e-commerce platform. Cohen thinks GameStop can use its brand and large customer base to make that transition. He has taken a large stake in the company to try and push it in that direction.', 'Business: GameStop is a retailer that sells video game hardware, physical and digital video game software, video game accessories, as well as mobile and consumer electronics products and other merchandise primarily through retail operations, with all stores engaged in the sale of new and pre-owned video game systems, software and accessories.', 'Stock Market Value: $828 million ($12.71 per share)', 'Percentage Ownership: 9.98%', 'Average Cost: $5.98', 'Activist Commentary: Cohen is not an activist but an extremely successful entrepreneur. Cohen is the co-founder and former CEO of e-commerce company Chewy, which he built up and sold to PetSmart in 2017 for $3.35 billion. Cohen remained CEO following the acquisition until March 2018, and in June 2019, Chewy went public at a valuation of $8.7 billion. This is Cohen’s first 13D filing, but what he lacks in activist experience he makes up for in strategic and operational qualifications in building and running a company in the digital era, giving him a ton of credibility here, even more so than the average activist with respect to certain areas.', 'On Nov. 16, 2020, Cohen sent a letter to the company’s board, urging them to immediately conduct a strategic review and to provide stockholders with a credible and publicly available roadmap for cost containment, prioritizing profitable retail locations and geographic markets and building the e-commerce ecosystem.', 'Cohen resorted to this public letter because his private attempts were not productive. GameStop sells video games and consoles and has been bearishly compared to Blockbuster. Cohen does not make that direct analogy, but he certainly paints the picture of a company that is on that same path if it does not change.', 'Sales have declined from $9.5 billion in fiscal year 2011 (before the last console cycle) to $6.4 billion in fiscal year 2019; EBITDA has dropped from $839 million in 2011 to only $111 million in 2019; net income has fallen from $339 million in 2011 to a loss of $470 million in 2019; and in the two most recent quarters alone, the company lost another $277 million. All of this happened while the size of the global gaming market has grown by more than 2.5x since the last console cycle. Cohen sees a company that is stuck in a brick-and-mortar mentality and is unwilling to embrace the digital mindset necessary to grow with gamers.', 'However, Cohen also sees a company with valuable assets, including a strong brand and large customer base and a path to success and shareholder value. He believes the company can be the ultimate destination for gamers, but that destination must start with a strong e-commerce platform that provides competitive pricing, broad gaming selection, fast shipping and a truly high touch experience that excites and delights customers, including content and community. It needs to become the Amazon of gaming, with the added expertise and specialized customer service as a key differentiator.', 'To do this, Cohen urges the company to cut excessive real estate costs, streamline or sell non-core operations in Europe and Australia and hire the right talent. While Cohen does not specifically target CEO George Sherman, he does note that Sherman has substantial experience working for large brick-and-mortar retailers such as Advance Auto Parts, Best Buy and Target and is committed to a twentieth century focus on physical stores and walk-in sales despite the transition to an always-on digital world.', 'The company is at an inflection point to make this change. Cohen notes that the company will be able to temporarily mask some of its issues with the new console cycle that will appear to validate its adherence to an outdated business model that is overdependent on brick-and-mortar sales. However, it is also this new console cycle and additional sales that can provide the cash flow to finance this strategy change into the future as the global gaming market is expected to reach $174.9 billion this year and $217.9 billion by 2023. ', 'Cohen alludes to the fact that one board seat would not be acceptable to him as he wants the company to actually focus on a shift in mindset. This would require at least two — and probably three or more — new directors to the ten-person board, depending on who is replaced. While it looks like Cohen might have an ally on the board in James Symancyk, the CEO of PetSmart while Cohen was running Chewy, Symancyk also has a brick-and-mortar background and might not see it the same way Cohen does.', 'If this does end up going to a proxy fight, Cohen seems like the type of shareholder who will take it the distance if necessary. In that case, he would have two potential headwinds. First, the company recently added four new directors through settlements and nominations by shareholders. That could be enough to placate certain institutional shareholders and ISS if they do not see as dire of a situation as Cohen does in this ultra-fast-moving industry. Second, a large part of the shareholder base is comprised of index funds such as BlackRock (12.12%), Vanguard (8.12%) and State Street (4.0%), who are reluctant to back an activist without the cover of an ISS or Glass Lewis recommendation.  However, what is interesting here is there is an unusually high short interest, with approximately 90% of the shares in lending programs, so we don’t really know who has loaned their shares, who can vote them and who can recall them before the meeting.', 'It will be interesting to see if the board will be able to stomach the change necessary to propel GameStop into the 21st century. In the words of former U.S. Army General Eric Shinseki: “If you don’t like change, you’re going to like irrelevance even less.”', 'Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments']"
