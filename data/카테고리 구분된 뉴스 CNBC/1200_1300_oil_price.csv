0,Supply chain woes and rising costs could make this a rocky earnings season for the market,2021-10-13T10:25:45+0000,"['Today is the traditional start of third-quarter earnings. Here’s the good news: Business is good. Demand for most goods and services are high. ', 'Here’s the bad news: Supply chain issues, labor shortages and higher energy prices are making this a very difficult quarter to model.', '“This could be a rough quarter,” Academy Securities head of macro strategy Peter Tchir said. “There is a real concern that if inflation runs hot it will suck away some of the ability of consumers to spend, even with what looks like stronger demand.”', 'While today is the “traditional” start of earnings season, because big banks like JPMorgan Chase reported, there are 22 companies that have already reported earnings, some of them with quarters that end in August. Analysts and strategists watch these reports carefully because they are a good “early warning indicator” for earnings in the third quarter that has just ended, as well as fourth-quarter guidance.', 'There are two problems:', '1. The early reporters are not beating estimates the way they once did. The 22 companies that are early reporters are beating estimates by 11%, according to The Earnings Scout CEO Nick Raich. While this is above the traditional beat of 3% to 5%, it is far below the average beats of prior quarters this year, including the roughly 18% beat for the second quarter.', '2. Those early reporters are not providing guidance that is as strong as last quarter. As a result, analysts are not raising estimates as aggressively as they were in prior quarters. ', 'What’s going on?', '“The positive estimate revision of 2021 has slowed dramatically because of rising inflation and supply chain issues,” Raich said. “Companies are not nearly as positive as they were three to six months ago.”', 'As a result, earnings growth, which has been rising for the past several quarters, is now showing signs of peaking. Third-quarter estimates, for example, have been rising steadily for months but have stopped in the last few weeks.', 'S&P 500 third-quarter earnings estimates(Year over year)', 'July 1    up 24.7%Oct. 1    up 29.4%Oct. 8     up 29.6%Source:  Refinitiv', '“This is going to be choppy, but some of it has already been broadcast by the broader market,” Canaccord Genuity chief market strategist Tony Dwyer said. He noted that financials, industrials, materials and energy — which are all cyclicals — underperformed all summer. “It was a summer of indigestion, and the markets were telegraphing it was going to be a difficult earnings season.”', 'Dwyer said we are now entering a “mid-cycle” phase of the economic recovery. During this period, earnings growth peaks, price-to-earnings ratios decline and the big market gains during the “early-cycle” phase become modest gains, or even reversals.', 'This has happened: The forward earnings multiple on the S&P 500 has gone from roughly 23 to 20, and the S&P 500 is 4% off its high of six weeks ago.', '“The average stock, particularly in the cyclical sectors, have already reacted to the transition from early cycle to mid-cycle,” Dwyer said. “If we are consistent with prior transition phases, you want to buy weakness.”', 'Others are concerned that these disruptions will last much longer than anticipated, outstripping the strong demand seen lately.', 'The poster child for this quarter’s earnings quagmire is Nike, which reported earnings Sept. 23. While earnings were slightly better than expected, revenue disappointed. The company said supply chain problems — including 10 weeks’ lost production in Vietnam, where 40% of their sneakers are made — along with elevated times to ship product, significantly affected the company’s ability to deliver goods.', 'Nike also said demand was outstanding, including a record back-to-school season in North America.', 'While Nike’s stock price dropped about 6% when the report came out, it has since recovered most of its losses, as investors have chosen to believe that strong demand is more important than temporary supply chain disruptions.', 'The worry among investors is that “supply chain disruption and higher cost” will become the standard refrain for most companies in the third and fourth quarter.', 'What if, for example, Apple pulls a Nike and says they cannot deliver enough iPhones, even though demand is strong? ', 'That’s what Bloomberg News reported Tuesday, saying the company was likely to cut iPhone 13 production targets for 2021 due to chip shortages. ', '“There’s an assumption that Apple would have figured a way around this, so a confirmation of that would definitely be a negative for markets,” Academy Securities’ Tchir said.', 'Canaccord’s Dwyer, however, insists even that announcement won’t have a long-term impact.  ', '“Who on the planet hasn’t heard there is a semiconductor crunch, a supply chain issue, and labor shortages?” he asked. “The question isn’t how long is it going to last, the question is, when is it going to be discounted?”', 'Tchir agrees that a chip shortage is not a long-term problem, but it’s not clear how long demand will remain this strong.', '“My concern are people are overstating how much future demand there is,” he said. “Everyone is assuming that when the supply comes, the demand will be there. What happens if the current purchasing habit is exaggerating what the true demand is? It’s possible demand has been pulled forward because of all these reports of shortages.” ', '“Assuming that demand is still going to be there in a few months is a risk,” Tchir said. “We could have the opposite problem: instead of a shortage of product, we have an inventory build.”', ' “It’s definitely going to be an interesting few months.”', ' ']"

The pharmacy space is notoriously complex and competitive in the U.S., and Amazon Pharmacy is built in part on PillPack’s infrastructure, including its pharmacy software, fulfillment centers and relationships with health plans.', 'Amazon Pharmacy, announced Tuesday, is the company’s biggest push yet into $300 billion market, and threatens the dominance of traditional pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens, as well as other large retailers that offer pharmacy services, including Walmart.', 'Pharmacy stocks tumbled following the launch of Amazon Pharmacy. CVS shares fell 8.6% on Tuesday. Walgreens Boots Alliance dropped 9.6%. Shares of Rite Aid slid 16.2%. GoodRx, which helps consumers find discounts on prescription drugs, fell 22.5%. Amazon shares closed slightly higher.', 'For Amazon, the announcement is well timed. Americans are increasingly relying on getting their medicines via mail to avoid possible exposure to the coronavirus. That shift could be permanent, as more people than ever before are learning about new ways of receiving medication.', '“We wanted to make it easy for people to get their medication, understand the cost and get it delivered to the home,” said TJ Parker, Amazon’s vice president of pharmacy, who previously co-founded PillPack. “The hard work is to make it easy ... there were a number of complications behind the scenes.”', '“We think this new benefit will add tremendous value to our members,” added Jamil Ghani, vice president of Amazon Prime. “It’s relevant as folks try to do more from the comfort and safety of their homes.”', 'Customers over the age of 18 will have access to the pharmacy service this week in 45 states, not including Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana and Minnesota. Amazon expects to serve those states over time.', 'Amazon Pharmacy will accept most forms of insurance, but could offer savings for people without insurance as well. Customers can also use flexible spending accounts or health savings accounts to buy prescriptions on the service.', 'Before customers order medication for the first time, the site might ask them questions such as whether they’re pregnant, their date of birth and their gender as it was assigned at birth. That information is required by law to provide pharmacy care, and it helps pharmacists to do things like confirm prescriptions.', 'Doctors can send prescriptions directly to Amazon Pharmacy, or patients can request a transfer from an existing retailer, like CVS or Walgreens. Amazon says it has tools to verify that a physician legitimately ordered each prescription, and to tamp down on potential fraud.', 'Amazon Prime customers get free two-day delivery, although shipping might take up to five days the first time a customer orders, as it takes time to transfer a medication. Customers who don’t have Prime can get free delivery within five days, or they can pay $5.99 to upgrade to two-day delivery.', 'The medicines on offer include a mix of generic and brand-name drugs. Customers can get access to birth control, as well as commonly prescribed drugs like insulin, triamcinolone steroid creams, metformin for controlling blood sugar and sumatriptan for migraines.', 'Amazon will not deliver Schedule II controlled medications, including most opioids, and it won’t be replacing the Health & Personal Care store by offering vitamins and supplements.', 'Customers who have questions about their medications can reach a pharmacist or pharmacy technician at any time through online self-service or phone. Amazon will also screen for potentially problematic drug interactions for customers who are taking multiple medications at once.', 'Amazon’s Parker said that the storage and collection of customer health information is in compliance with federal HIPAA rules, and the company won’t share pharmacy data with advertisers or marketers without permission.', 'Amazon has leveraged its rich troves of customer data to build advertising into a key pillar of its overall business, and shows customers personalized ads and offers discounts based on what they have bought in the past. But consumers are likely to have a different set of expectations when they’re placing a prescription order versus browsing for a new pair of pants.', '“The information and experience you have inside the pharmacy is separate and distinct from the experience that you have on Amazon.com,” Parker said.', 'PillPack will continue to serve customers even after Amazon Pharmacy launches. That’s because PillPack is designed for a different use-case: It delivers medicines on a 30-day schedule to a population of patients that tend to be sicker and older than average, and often require multiple prescriptions.', 'Amazon Prime members have access to an additional pharmacy perk called the “prescription savings benefit,” which offers a discount of up to 80% on generic medications and up to 40% on brand-name prescriptions.', 'Amazon negotiated those discounts through a relationship with the Inside Rx savings program, which is part of Evernorth, a company that grew out of a merger between Express Scripts and insurance giant Cigna in 2018. Insurers use pharmacy benefits managers like Evernorth to negotiate drug rebates from drug manufacturers in exchange for better coverage.', 'Even for people who have health coverage, the Prime price might still end up being more affordable than the copay -- Amazon’s Parker said it happens “more frequently than people think” (although it won’t count toward a deductible).', 'Prime customers can also get a prescription savings benefit card to use at up to 50,000 pharmacies, including CVS, Walmart, Rite Aid and Walgreens. This might be preferable for customers who have an urgent need for medication and can’t wait two days for delivery.', 'Amazon’s Parker said the company does not currently have any brick-and-mortar pharmacies, and declined to speculate on its plans. But in future, the company could add pharmacies to Whole Foods and its chain of Amazon Fresh stores.', 'Correction: This story has been updated to correct the spelling of the Inside Rx savings program.']"

The company said Wednesday that it’s extending downtime on the Bolt at the Orion Assembly plant in suburban Detroit by two more weeks, to Nov. 1.', 'Manufacturing defects have caused at least 13 Bolts — the company’s flagship mainstream EV — to spontaneously catch fire, leading GM to recall every one of the electric cars since production began in 2016.', 'The manufacturing problems occurred at LG Battery Solution’s plants in South Korea and Michigan. The “rare manufacturing defects” in the Bolt EVs are a torn anode tab and folded separator that when present in the same battery cell increase the risk of fire, according to GM.', 'The automaker’s battery supplier, LG Chem, started shipping replacement modules for battery packs for more than 140,000 Bolt EVs earlier this month.', 'GM on Tuesday announced the automaker and LG have reached an agreement for the battery supplier to reimburse the automaker for the recall costs. As a result of the agreement, GM will recognize an estimated recovery in the third quarter that will offset $1.9 billion of $2.0 billion in charges associated with the recalls.', 'Separately, GM on Wednesday said production of the Chevrolet Equinox at Ramos Assembly in Mexico will take an additional three weeks of downtime due to the global shortage of semiconductors, through the week of Nov. 15.', 'Production of the Equinox in Mexico has been down since Aug. 16, while assembly of the Chevrolet Blazer that’s produced at the plant is expected to restart next week.']"

For most of its 30 year history, Boston Dynamics has been focused on research and development. Initially, Boston Dynamics received a lot of its funding from the U.S. military and DARPA. Later, it was financed by big-name owners including Google, SoftBank and most recently, Hyundai. All of these companies have tried to steer the robot maker on a path to commercialization, and Boston Dynamics is finally getting there.', '“I expect that we will become a serial producer of novel robots with advanced capabilities. I think we’ll build, every, say three to five years, we’re going to roll out a new robot targeting a new industry,” says Robert Playter, CEO of Boston Dynamics.', 'But for now, Boston Dynamics is focusing on the inspection and warehouse industries with its robots Spot and Stretch.', '“The next big industry for Spot is really in this this market that we’re calling industrial sensing or dynamics sensing, which is where we have robots walking around places like manufacturing plants, chemical plants, utilities, installations, and using the robots to collect data on what’s happening in these facilities in an automated way,” says Zack Jackowski, chief engineer of the Spot product. “And this is really interesting, because once you start getting this highly repeatable, high quality data, you could start understanding these facilities and the efficiencies of them in new ways.”', 'So far, Spot has been used to do inspections at construction sites, oil rigs, nuclear plants, to check the vital signs of Covid-19 patients in hospitals, and even remind people to maintain social distance amid the pandemic. Boston Dynamics said it has sold several hundred Spot robots so far, with the entry level robot costing around $75,000.', 'The company’s other commercial robot, Stretch, focuses on the warehouse market.', '“We see Stretch as ultimately a general purpose box moving machine that can be used anywhere in the warehouse,” says Playter. “Something like 800 million containers are shipped around the world each year. Many of those are full of boxes. There’s probably trillions of boxes that are loaded and unloaded by hand each year in the United States. It’s a huge job. It’s a mountain of material that has to get moved. Stretch is really power tools to help people move that that material.”', 'Stretch is made up of a few different parts.

9,An $11 trillion global hydrogen energy boom is coming. Here’s what could trigger it,2020-11-01T14:52:28+0000,"['Some 130 miles south of Salt Lake City, engineers are working on what will become a giant cavity in the ground. It’s a geological formation known as a salt dome, a column of salt surrounded by sedimentary layers, and when it’s filled with hydrogen, it could become one of the largest renewable energy reservoirs in the world.', 'The historic wildfires that devastated California this year have highlighted concerns about climate change and how to make our society sustainable. The state aims to source all its power needs from clean, renewable energy by 2045, and Gov. Gavin Newsom recently said sales of new gas-powered passenger cars and trucks will end by 2035. Under a roadmap approved by the state regulator, California will need nearly 25 gigawatts in new renewable capacity, including some 8,900 megawatts of storage, by 2030. The Utah project could help meet those targets.    ', 'The Advanced Clean Energy Storage (ACES) project aims to build a storage facility for 1,000 megawatts of clean power, partly by putting hydrogen into underground salt caverns. Last year, Mitsubishi Power, a maker of gas turbines, and Magnum Development, which owns salt caverns for liquid fuel storage, announced the project will combine technologies such as renewable hydrogen, solid-oxide fuel cells, and compressed air energy storage. The storage facility would initially have enough energy to power 150,000 households for one year. Scheduled to be operational by 2025, the first phase of the Advanced Clean Energy Storage project will provide 150,000 MWh of renewable power storage capacity, nearly 150 times the current U.S. installed lithium-ion battery storage base, according to Mitsubishi Power.', 'The project will also help address a problem with renewable energy production: fossil-based energy must be used immediately because grids lack storage capacity, which can mean curtailment of renewables in times of low demand. Having large-scale renewable energy reserves on tap can accelerate the shift to clean power. If former Vice President Joe Biden is elected president next month, he may funnel up to $1.7 trillion over 10 years into measures to boost renewables and accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles.', 'Green hydrogen is hydrogen produced with renewable power and zero emissions. With the cost of renewables like solar power falling, green hydrogen is being touted as one part of the energy mix that will lead toward decarbonization, with applications ranging from consumer and industrial power supplies to transportation and spaceflight. By 2050, U.S. demand for hydrogen could jump to 22 million to 41 million metric tons per year, up from 10 million today, according to a study released this month by the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory.', 'After decades of false starts, hydrogen technology is poised to take off as falling production costs, technological improvements, and a global push toward sustainability converge, according to Bank of America. The firm believes this will generate $2.5 trillion in direct revenue — or $4 trillion if revenue from associated products such as fuel cell vehicles is counted — with the total market potential reaching $11 trillion by 2050.', 'Major firms such as BP, Siemens Energy, Shell and Air Liquide are interested in green hydrogen production, but part of the challenge is where to store energy so it can be ready when needed. That’s where a project like Advanced Clean Energy Storage can help.', '“California curtailed between 150,000-300,000 MWh of excess renewable energy per month through the spring of 2020, yet saw its first rolling blackouts in August because the grid was short on energy,” says Paul Browning, CEO of Mitsubishi Power Americas. “Long-duration energy storage projects like ours that are designed to shift excess energy from periods of oversupply, like California in the spring, to periods of undersupply, like California in late summer, are critical to ensure similar events are avoided as we continue to make significant strides towards deep decarbonization.”', 'Storing fuel in salt caverns isn’t new, but hydrogen’s growing role in decarbonization has revitalized interest in the concept. The U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve has long stored emergency crude oil in underground salt caverns on the Gulf Coast, and notes they cost 10 times less than aboveground tanks and 20 times less than hard rock mines. The Reserve has 60 enormous caverns, typically 200 feet in diameter and 2,500 feet tall, and one “large enough for Chicago’s Willis Tower to fit inside with room to spare.”', 'Caverns can be created in salt domes by drilling into the salt dome and injecting the rock with water, which dissolves the salt. The resulting brine is extracted, leaving a large cavity. The next step is storing hydrogen in the cavern. Hydrogen electrolyzers can convert water into hydrogen by using renewable energy from solar and other sources. The hydrogen can then be stored, and reconverted to electricity when needed.', 'In the Advanced Clean Energy Storage project, some will power the adjacent Intermountain Power Project, a coal-fired plant operated by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power that will be converted to hydrogen and natural gas, which produces almost half the carbon dioxide of coal, by 2025. It’s scheduled to be all green hydrogen by 2045. If the initial phase of the project is successful, the salt dome’s vast capacity could be exploited further.', '“The formation has the potential to create up to 100 caverns, each one capable of holding 150,000 MWh of energy,” says Browning. “It would take 40,000 shipping containers of batteries to store that much energy in each cavern.”  ', 'Despite their storage potential, low operating cost and the fact that underground salt distribution is well known, only a handful of salt caverns have been created to store hydrogen. However, the concept is quickly gaining momentum in Europe, where the European Commission sees the share of hydrogen in Europe’s energy mix rising from under 2% as of 2019 to 13-14% by 2050.', 'Funded by the German government, the HYPOS alliance of over 100 companies and institutions aims to build a salt cavern in the Central German Chemical Triangle in Saxony-Anhalt with about 150,000 MWh of energy from wind power-generated hydrogen. Regulators are now reviewing the plans and when filling begins in 2023 or 2024, it could be continental Europe’s first hydrogen storage cavern, according to Stefan Bergander, a HYPOS project manager. Meanwhile, French gas utility Teréga and Hydrogène de France have agreed to launch the HyGéo pilot project in a disused salt cavern in southwestern France’s Nouvelle-Aquitaine region; it will store about 1.5 GWh of energy, enough for 400 households for a year.', '“Underground storage, in salt caverns or in porous media (i.e., in aquifers or in depleted oil and gas fields) is the only way to cope with big storage capacities,” says Louis Londe, technical director at Geostock, a French company specializing in underground storage. “Many hydrogen cavern projects for energy storage are blooming in Europe. At present, they are at the design stage. Not surprisingly, the leading countries are those where salt is the most present: Germany, U.K., Ireland, France, Netherlands.”', 'Europe has enough salt formations on and offshore to theoretically store about 85 petawatt hours of hydrogen power, according to a study published this year in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy. The figure is hypothetical, and doesn’t take economics into account, but for example, 1 PWh of hydrogen is enough to supply today’s electricity demand in Germany for an entire year, says Dilara Gulcin Caglayan, lead author of the study and a scientist at the German research center Forschungszentrum Jülich’s Institute of Energy and Climate Research.', '“Our calculations show that without implementation of hydrogen salt caverns, there’s no cost-optimal pathway to achieve our climate goals,” says the institute’s deputy director Martin Robinius, a coauthor of the study. “By 2040, we will need a lot of hydrogen salt caverns, but if we don’t start building them now, we won’t be able to build them to scale to meet those goals.”', 'As part of its goal to be climate-neutral by 2050, the European Commission recently produced a hydrogen roadmap saying rapid, large-scale deployment of clean hydrogen is key for the European Union to lower greenhouse gas emissions by at least half by 2030, adding that “Investment in hydrogen will foster sustainable growth and jobs, which will be critical in the context of recovery from the COVID-19 crisis.”', '“The issue of storage is, of course, key to delivering energy transition and in this respect hydrogen and hydrogen technologies have a critical role to play,” says Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, secretary general of Hydrogen Europe, an alliance of about 250 companies and research organizations that has called for Covid-19 recovery investment of €55 billion ($65 billion) in salt cavern storage to 2030 to build hydrogen capacity of 3 million metric tons. “Large scale hydrogen storage facilities, mainly salt caverns and possibly some empty gas fields, need to be part of hydrogen infrastructure.”']"

That means he has to convince PC makers to ship and promote new versions of Windows, even as Microsoft competes directly against them.', 'That dual role is on full display this week as Microsoft starts offering upgrades to Windows 11, its first new operating system since 2015, while at the same time launching its latest Surface computers.', '“I spend as much time with the OEMs as I do with Surface right now,” Panay told CNBC. ', 'He declined to say whether Surface or Windows is more important to him than the other, but Windows licenses still generate considerably more revenue for Microsoft than Surface computers. Morgan Stanley estimated that Microsoft will generate $13.3 billion in Windows OEM revenue and $6.5 billion in Surface revenue in the 2021 fiscal year.', 'But the partners that license Windows haven’t always supported Microsoft’s moves to step on their turf with its own tablets and laptops. The CEO of Acer told the Financial Times Microsoft should “think twice” when it first introduced its Surface tablet in 2012. And Asus reportedly felt blindsided when Panay unveiled the Surface Book -- which was more like a traditional laptop computer -- in 2015.', 'When Panay speaks at Microsoft events about the latest Surface computers, he almost unnaturally enthusiastic and oddly specific about hardware components.

What do you want to accomplish? You can pick a device that suits you.”', 'In 2016, Microsoft announced a partnership with Lenovo, the world’s biggest seller of PCs, in an effort to prevent conflicts that might arise between the Surface business and Windows.', '“We came to a very simple approach...we call it a level playing field,” said Lenovo’s leader of worldwide strategic alliances, Christian Eigen, who has known Panay for 15 years. “It means Microsoft does not give, from an operating system point of view, any feature exclusively to Surface.”', 'The CEOs of Microsoft and Lenovo communicate four to six times per year, and teams lower down in the organizations talk 12 to 24 times per year, Eigen explained.', 'Microsoft also improved its communications with partners around Windows 11.', '“It was definitely, by far, more transparent and open and kind of cooperative development,” Eigen said. He joined Lenovo, the world’s top PC maker by unit shipments, in 2011 and was there for the releases of Windows 8 in 2012 and Windows 10 in 2015.', 'Steven Sinofsky, who supervised the releases of Windows 7 and Windows 8, had pushed for a different approach to partner communication in 2018 when he said in a blog post any changes in direction can make the company look bad and cause issues for partners and customers.', 'Panay has emphasized communication, including with outsiders. As soon as he took on the Windows role last year, he began meeting with employees at chipmakers such as AMD and Intel, as well as Lenovo, Samsung and other PC makers.', '“My whole goal is, ‘Hey, what do your customers need?’ This is from an OEM brand perspective,” Panay said. “Same with Surface. ‘What do the Surface customers need?’ Ultimately, they’re all Windows customers.” He said has has had input on every Surface model, including the Surface Laptop Studio PC that went on sale this week.', 'Since Microsoft announced Windows 11 details in June, people have debated the minimum hardware requirements the company is insisting on, including a security chip.', 'Eigen said the hurdles to upgrade aren’t too big.', '“I believe that Microsoft made the right decision to say, ‘Look, at a certain point we need to make progress with our operating system,’” Eigen said.

Early adopters might buy them at first, but people won’t all suddenly have new computers running Windows 10, because of the chip shortage, Cherry said.', 'The PC market enjoyed a 13% year-over-year increase in unit shipments in 2020, the fastest growth in a decade, according to estimates from market research company IDC. And many of the computers people bought last year can upgrade to Windows 11 for free. The buying frenzy might not continue for much longer, even as many people continue remote work. While IDC forecasts 14% growth for 2021, it sees shipments rising less than 2% in 2022.', 'But Panos argued some Surface features are more compelling to customers now.', '″‘Why do you put cameras and microphones on your Surface?’ I’d be asked that question,” Panay said. “Can you imagine trying to ask that question today?” Now cameras and microphones enable people to meet virtually through their computers with coworkers, classmates and family members.', 'A new look for Windows counts for something, too. New Windows versions make a difference in people’s willingness to spend their money, Burd said.', 'Eigen, at Lenovo, said he’s hoping Windows 11 will accelerate the cycle of people replacing PCs. Young people might want to graduate from just owning smartphones, while older people might want to upgrade because the PC is easier to use with Windows 11, he said.', 'Panay’s optimistic.

But most notably, this the first time Apple’s all-in-one desktop computer is using the same M1 chip as the iPad, following the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and Mac Mini, which received the processor last year.', 'It’s a heck of a time to launch a new Mac. Apple’s Mac sales have continued to grow through the pandemic and were up 70% year over year in its fiscal Q2 as people worked, learned and played at home. That growth may slow as people continue to get vaccinated and head back to our commutes (and our clunky work-issued computers), but the iMac is so nice it may help push Mac sales for people who still need a computer at home.', 'Here’s what you need to know about it.', 'The iMac is just crazy, crazy thin. It’s sort of like a giant iPad with a big bottom chin sitting on a metal stand. It’s also surprisingly light, which means you can easily move it from room to room if you need to, so long as there’s an outlet nearby.', 'I love the variety of colors. Apple sent me the blue model, which has a deeper hue on the back than the sort of sky blue below the display on the front. It really looks and feels as if Apple is trying to make this the Mac that people show off around their house again, and I think some people actually will.', 'The screen is another highlight. It’s now 24 inches diagonally, a notable improvement from the 21.5-inch display on the model it replaces. It’s also nice and sharp with a 4.5K resolution and support for HDR content, which more clearly shows the deep darks and bright parts of a movie or TV show. I used the iMac as a computer in my office and also as a TV in my bedroom. I liked that the screen was big enough that I could watch stuff from bed as I would on a TV.', 'The iMac is fast and all the apps I use for work and play are supported. Most people who are casually editing photos and videos will find there’s enough power. Pros who want to edit and render video, however, will naturally gravitate toward Apple’s Pro machines, since there isn’t a big beefy graphics card in here. The same goes for games — you’re fine playing games that are a few years old, or any of the popular iPad or iPhone games that run on M1, like everything in Apple Arcade. But don’t expect to play something like Call of Duty: Warzone.', 'The speakers are also surprisingly good for how thin it is. I normally use a pair of $50 speakers on my desktop PC and this blows them away. There’s also a headphone jack in case you ever want to add a different set of speakers, or you can always use Bluetooth to pair up with a headset or AirPods.', 'There are two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports on the back of the entry-level $1,299 model, and the $1,499 version I tested has an additional two USB 3 ports (this is true for all more expensive models, too). That was enough for me to drop a few cables on the back for charging my iPhone, AirPods and more at my desk, while also using one of the Thunderbolt ports to add a second display. If you want to avoid dongles, consider getting the model with the additional ports. Speaking of ports, the charger uses a magnet, though it’s not branded MagSafe like the older MacBook and current iPhone 12 chargers. It’s just a power port that’s a bit safer since it’ll pop out if you trip on the cable.', 'The new Magic Keyboard, which matches the color of the computer you buy (as does the mouse) can be configured with a Touch ID fingerprint sensor for $50 more. You should do that while buying the iMac. It’s really convenient for making purchases (like you would on Apple’s laptops), for logging in in a split second, or for sharing a computer. Each family member just registers their fingerprints and then they can tap it to log in to their account when they jump on the computer.', 'Finally, the camera quality is noticeably better. Apple’s M1 chip offers better quality even compared with the 27-inch iMac it launched last summer, which uses the same camera hardware. It did a good job keeping my image clear and bright, even if the room was a little dark. But I’d love to see Apple add some of the smart tracking so that the camera could follow me around the room — if I’m pacing while talking to my editor over FaceTime. It’s a feature Apple introduced in the new iPad Pros this year, so maybe that will make its way over in future models.', 'All of this comes together to form a really capable desktop computer for the price. But there are still a few things I think could be improved.', 'The thing that stands out to me most here is the lack of a touchscreen. Apple has said Macs serve one purpose and iPads serve another. But I think a touchscreen would work well here. If you’re flipping through recipes, for example, you might want to touch the screen instead of using a mouse. Also, the iMac’s M1 chip lets you run iPhone and iPad apps if they’re supported by the developer. A lot of the ones you might want, like Netflix and YouTube TV (or any of Google’s apps for that matter) aren’t there. But many are designed to be used with touch. ', 'Maybe I’m crazy, but I’d love to see an option in macOS that lets you flip to the iPadOS for when you want to use it like a touchscreen, and then switch back to regular macOS when you don’t. Imagine just walking up and tapping Netflix and tapping a TV show. (I’d like to see macOS on an iPad Pro, too.) I can dream.', 'It’s kind of a bummer it doesn’t have an older regular USB 2.0 port. I know it’s old technology, but there are still tons of chargers and accessories that use that type without an adapter, including the Apple Watch.', 'I also wish the display supported more angles. You can adjust the vertical angle by tilting it back or forward, but you can’t raise or lower the display or turn it left to right. It’s just locked onto the stand. Normally this works fine, but if you have a shorter desk or sit up higher on your chair, you might want to know you can’t really adjust it to match your height unless you prop it up on some books.', 'My guess is most people are going to use the iMac with just the built-in screen, since it’s pretty big. But the M1 chip only supports one additional monitor, the same as with the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and Mac Mini. So if you’re like me and normally use three separate displays, you’re going to be limited. I found I was able to get up to three screens by using an iPad Pro with the Side Car app, however. But you won’t get three big screens over HDMI or Thunderbolt.', 'Lastly, it has a big chin under the screen. It doesn’t bug me at all, but I think people who are used to big screens without much of a border might find it a turn-off. That’s just a personal preference thing.', 'The new iMac is a fantastic desktop computer and worth buying if you need a desktop computer for you or the family. It will make a great home school computer for your kids, or an office desktop. ', 'But I also think you should consider buying a MacBook Air, my current favorite computer on the market given its power, battery life and price. Then, you can add a big screen at your desk, like this $400 one from LG, or something more expensive like this from Dell, and just plug the Air in when you want a big, bright display.', 'The catch is that a quality 4K display with the colors, brightness and accuracy of the iMac is going to set you back several hundred dollars or more. You’ll also miss out on the good built-in speakers, added ports and webcam. But you gain portability, since you can take your MacBook Air everywhere you go.', 'It’s a toss-up, but worth considering both options if you’re shopping for a new computer now.', 'Overall, I think Apple has a winner here with an all-around solid computer that checks most boxes for most people. I can’t help but wonder how many of these Apple would have sold if it launched at the beginning of the pandemic.', 'Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube. ']"

The company generally views devices as a way to get consumers to use other services, such as Prime shipping or music and video streaming.', 'WATCH: Amazon introduces Astro, the robot']"
19,Navy’s top civilian calls for deeper investigation into coronavirus outbreak on aircraft carrier,2020-04-29T15:08:17+0000,"['WASHINGTON — The Navy’s top civilian is calling for another investigation into events surrounding the coronavirus outbreak on an aircraft carrier, which led to the dismissal of its captain, who had pleaded for help, and the resignation of the former acting secretary of the Navy.', 'Upon reviewing the findings of the investigation into the USS Theodore Roosevelt and Capt. Brett Crozier, the newly tapped acting secretary of the Navy said he had “unanswered questions” and would, therefore, need “a deeper review.”', '“This investigation will build on the good work of the initial inquiry to provide a more fulsome understanding of the sequence of events, actions, and decisions of the chain of command surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak aboard USS Theodore Roosevelt,” acting Secretary of the Navy James McPherson wrote in a statement. ', 'The latest twist comes on the heels of the Navy’s recommendation  last week that Crozier, who sounded the alarm about a growing coronavirus outbreak aboard the carrier, should be reinstated to his command. ', 'At the time, the decision to reinstate Crozier’s command of the Roosevelt sat with Secretary of Defense Mark Esper. The Pentagon boss, who was briefed on the recommendations following the Navy investigation, requested more time to review the findings. ', 'The secondary investigation is the latest development in a messy string of events that resulted in the resignation of acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly. ', 'Crozier was relieved of duty by Modly after the captain’s letter pleading for help to mitigate the spread of the virus aboard the aircraft carrier was leaked to the media. Modly then took a 35-hour trip, which cost taxpayers $243,000, to address the crew of the Roosevelt. ', 'In the address, delivered via the ship’s loudspeaker, Modly doubled down on his decision to relieve Crozier and called the former vessel’s captain “naive” and “stupid.” Hours later Modly issued an apology to the Navy.', '“I also want to apologize directly to Captain Crozier, his family, and the entire crew of the Theodore Roosevelt for any pain my remarks may have caused,” he said in a statement April 6.

The mission, called Demo-2, is technically the final test flight of the company’s spacecraft. Regardless of the nature of the mission, Demo-2 will be the first launch of NASA astronauts from the U.S. since 2011.', '“This is a new generation, a new era in spaceflight,” NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine said.', 'See CNBC’s live blog for up-to-the-minute coverage, and watch the launch live here.', 'Ever since the space shuttle retired nearly a decade ago, the U.S. has paid Russia upwards of $80 million per seat to fly NASA astronauts to the International Space Station. But NASA awarded SpaceX and Boeing with contracts worth $3.1 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively, to develop new spacecraft under a program called Commercial Crew. For SpaceX, the Demo-2 launch represents the final flight test of its Crew Dragon capsule, built to carry as many as seven people to orbit.', '“We need to have the capability of accessing space — not just for NASA, but for all of humanity,” Bridenstine said.', 'The historic importance of Demo-2 is drawing a wide audience, from Wall Street to Silicon Valley to the nation’s capital. VIPs scheduled to attend at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center include President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. SpaceX founder and CEO Musk  plans to watch from within the Mission Control room just a few miles from the launch site.', 'Morgan Stanley is telling investors to pay attention to Demo-2 because of what it means for the future of private spaceflight and the many companies working on technologies to support futures missions. ', '“Mark May 27th on your calendars. You don’t want to miss this,” Morgan Stanley said.', 'One of the key factors for launching remains the temperamental Florida weather. NASA and SpaceX continue to move forward with the launch as planned, with liftoff set for 4:33 p.m. ET Wednesday. As of Monday, the Air Force’s 45th Space Wing forecast that the launch has a 40% probability, given current weather concerns, which include rain and thick clouds. If NASA and SpaceX decide to postpone the launch, the mission has back-up times set for Saturday at 3:22 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m.', 'While thousands of people have come to Florida’s Space Coast to watch NASA launch crew, the agency made an unprecedented request given the coronavirus crisis. The head of NASA said “now is not the time” for large crowds to gather on the highways and beaches to watch the launch. ', '“Join us in this launch but do so from home. We are asking people not to travel to the Kennedy Space Center,” Bridenstine said.', 'NASA will broadcast 24 hours of nonstop live coverage of SpaceX Demo-2. The webcast will begin four hours before liftoff and continues until the spacecraft docks with the International Space Station the next day.', 'Here is what you need to know about SpaceX’s first astronaut launch.', 'Crew Dragon is the name of the SpaceX capsule that will carry NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley. It’s an evolved version of the company’s Cargo Dragon spacecraft, which has launched to-and-from the space station 20 times. Just as Cargo Dragon was the first privately developed spacecraft to bring supplies to the ISS, so Crew Dragon will be the first privately developed spacecraft to bring people. ', '“The investments that we have made into SpaceX and the investment SpaceX has made in itself have really resulted in something that is going to be very beneficial — not just for human space exploration, but beneficial for the economy,” Bridenstine said. ', 'Likewise, SpaceX President and COO Gwynne Shotwell told reporters that “NASA has been an extraordinary customer and extraordinary partner” for the company. While Shotwell didn’t know specifically how much SpaceX had spent of its own funds to develop Crew Dragon, she noted that “SpaceX invests heavily in our products.” Last year, Musk said SpaceX had invested on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars to fund Crew Dragon development.', 'NASA also expects that in addition to getting a way to send astronauts to space, it will be getting a cost-saving option as well. The agency expects to pay $55 million per astronaut to fly with Crew Dragon, as opposed to $86 million per astronaut to fly with the Russians.', '“We together have become stronger in engineering technical support for this nation,” NASA Commercial Crew program manager Kathy Lueders said.', 'Crew Dragon with its trunk stands just under 27 feet tall and 13 feet around. The spacecraft includes its own system of small rocket engines for directional control in space and a launch abort system in the event of an emergency. Its trunk is the large lower half that’s covered in solar panels, which can carry cargo.', 'The spacecraft is designed to carry seven people. It has a system of controls that is focused around touch screens, although NASA notes that Crew Dragon has a “robust fault tolerance built into the system.” As the astronauts will be wearing custom SpaceX spacesuits, the touch screens work whether or not the astronauts are wearing gloves. The spacesuits are largely designed to protect the astronauts in the event that the spacecraft loses pressurization, with life support and power systems connected through a point on the spacesuit’s leg.', 'Additionally, the astronauts are expected to have to manually control the spacecraft only for a short period. Even the very careful docking process when Crew Dragon reaches the ISS is expected to be done autonomously.', 'SpaceX’s Falcon 9 is the workhorse of the company’s growing fleet of rockets. It stands at nearly 230 feet tall and is capable of launching as much as 25 tons to low Earth orbit. ', 'Crew Dragon will sit in place of the rocket’s nose cone at the top. After launching the spacecraft on its way, the large lower portion of Falcon 9, known as the “booster,” will reenter the Earth’s atmosphere and attempt to land on the company’s drone ship in the ocean. SpaceX has landed its Falcon 9 rocket boosters 44 times.', 'Behnken, 49, and Hurley, 53, have been astronauts since being selected in NASA’s class of 2000. Each flew on two space shuttle missions, with Hurley notably flying on that spacecraft’s last mission in July 2011. Both are military veterans: Behnken served in the Air Force and Hurley in the Marine Corps.', 'For Demo-2, Behnken is the joint operations commander, which means he is responsible for tasks such as reaching the ISS and docking. Hurley is the spacecraft commander and will be responsible for Crew Dragon’s launch, landing and recovery.', 'The pair officially entered a preflight quarantine on May 13, although the astronauts said they’ve been self-isolating since mid-March. While astronauts typically enter a quarantine ahead of a mission, the protocol has been additionally strict for Demo-2 due to the coronavirus. NASA commercial spaceflight director Phil McAlister said earlier this month that “direct interaction with the crew is not permitted without appropriate protective gear.” Even interaction with VIPs the day before launch will be through a glass wall.', 'SpaceX has also taken extra precautions. Shotwell said that in the last two months, the company has been “ensuring that only essential personnel” were going near astronauts during training. SpaceX employees “are wearing masks and gloves,” she added.', '“We are social distancing as well. We’ve got at least half our engineering staff working from home,” Shotwell said.', 'Even the Mission Control room will look different than in years past, NASA said. The agency will use different rooms to keep people safely distant from each other, with NASA looking to add plexiglass between seats and stations for Demo-2.', 'Four hours before liftoff, Behnken and Hurley will suit up. About a half an hour later, the crew will walk out to their Tesla Model X, complete with NASA logos, and drive from the astronaut quarters out to the launchpad.', 'With 2½ hours to go, the astronauts will strap into their seats in Crew Dragon and begin checking that all systems are good to go. Then, with just under two hours until launch, the hatch to the spacecraft will be closed. ', 'SpaceX will begin loading the rocket with fuel 35 minutes before launch, which will initiate a final series of processes and checks.', '“We’ve worked closely with NASA since 2006 and all that work is culminating to this historic event,” Shotwell said. “My heart is sitting right here [in my throat], and I think it’s going to stay there until we get Bob and Doug safely back from the International Space Station.”  ', 'A few minutes after liftoff, the Falcon 9′s booster stage will return and attempt to land on the company’s barge stationed in the Atlantic Ocean.', 'If anything were to go wrong in the last half hour before the launch and even during the launch, Crew Dragon will abort and fire its emergency escape system. The company performed a full test of that system in January with no one inside the spacecraft. That test saw SpaceX trigger the system during the most intense part of the launch to show that it could be done at any time.', 'The Demo-2 mission has only just begun after Crew Dragon reaches orbit. As the final flight test for SpaceX’s capsule, NASA said Demo-2 “will validate the company’s crew transportation system, including the launch pad, rocket, spacecraft, and operational capabilities.”', 'Docking with the ISS will be a critical part of the mission. Although expected to be done autonomously, the docking and undocking process is essentially a high-speed dance in orbit, as both the ISS and Crew Dragon will be moving at tens of thousands of miles per hour. SpaceX created a virtual simulator of the docking process, so that viewers can try their hand at manually docking Crew Dragon. Notably, the virtual simulator use the actual interface that Behnken and Hurley would use when piloting the spacecraft.', 'Once Crew Dragon docks, Behnken and Hurley will become part of the crew on the ISS. In addition to performing test on Crew Dragon, the astronauts will join the rest of the ISS crew in conducting research and other tasks.', 'NASA is not sure how long the Demo-2 mission will last. McAlister said the mission has “an unbelievably complicated set of criteria and considerations” for its duration, which is currently set for between 30 to 119 days. The Crew Dragon spacecraft for future missions will be capable of staying in space for at least 210 days.', 'After undocking, Behnken and Hurley will point Crew Dragon back toward Earth. The capsule will reenter the Earth’s atmosphere and then use its parachutes to slow and splash down in the Atlantic. The astronauts will then be picked up at sea by SpaceX’s ship “GO Navigator” and then return to Florida’s Space Coast.', 'Demo-2 represents the final step before NASA certifies the SpaceX capsule to fly regular, long missions to the ISS. After those missions begin, SpaceX plans to use Crew Dragon spacecraft for other missions. Those include space tourism, as the company has so far unveiled two deals to fly privately paying people to space on Crew Dragon as early as next year.', 'Subscribe to CNBC PRO for exclusive insights and analysis, and live business day programming from around the world.']"
21,Trump administration paying huge premium for mask-cleaning machines. Which don’t do the job.,2020-05-20T17:54:47+0000,"['It sounded like a great deal: The White House coronavirus task force would buy a defense company’s new cleaning machines to allow critical protective masks to be reused up to 20 times. And at $60 million for 60 machines on April 3, the price was right.', 'But over just a few days, the potential cost to taxpayers exploded to $413 million, according to notes of a coronavirus task force meeting obtained by NBC News. By May 1, the Pentagon pegged the ceiling at $600 million in a justification for awarding the deal without an open bidding process or an actual contract. Even worse, scientists and nurses say the recycled masks treated by these machines begin to degrade after two or three treatments, not 20, and the company says its own recent field testing has only confirmed the integrity of the masks for four cycles of use and decontamination.', 'Nurses in several places across the country now say they are afraid of being at greater risk of acquiring Covid-19 while using N95 masks, which they say often don’t fit correctly after just a few spins through a cleaning system that uses vapor phase hydrogen peroxide to disinfect them.', 'The nurses, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution from their employers or the government, said they believe the machines, which are made by the Battelle Memorial Institute and have been promoted by President Donald Trump, were rushed into service as a shortcut to acquiring and manufacturing protective equipment.', '“It’s a fairy tale,” said one nurse in Connecticut who works at a hospital where masks are run through the Battelle decontamination system. “It’s being done because we don’t have the policies in place to do what needs to be done, and people are going to be hurt because of it.”', 'As Trump has pushed to find silver-bullet solutions to the pandemic during an election year, the speedy decision to activate the machines reflects yet again the problematic decision-making of the White House task force. As a series of NBC News articles have shown, its leaders have looked past financial costs, potential harm to the public and the risk of getting ghosted by bidders in order to give Trump a steady stream of deals to announce, often with major companies.', '“They’re always swinging for the fences hoping that one time they’ll hit a grand slam” and not worrying if they strike out, said one administration official familiar with the work of the task force. “They’re gambling that they’ll win one time, and if they don’t they’ll just deflect, which is what we see inside all the time.”', 'In weeks of interviews, email exchanges and text messages over the last month with scores of people involved at all levels of the coronavirus response — senior White House officials to front-line responders, career federal officials to scientists working in the field, corporate CEOs to front-line responders — a picture of the task force’s methods has come into ever-sharper focus. Working without external oversight, it has pumped billions of dollars into hard-to-trace contracts for Covid-19 supplies that often don’t pan out as advertised.', 'White House officials have said often that the president is doing everything he can to protect the nation from the twin emergencies of the disease and its effect on the economy, and Trump and his lieutenants have routinely justified waiving safety and contracting rules by pointing to the need to speed supplies to the front lines of the fight. But critics say Trump has prioritized political ends at the expense of sound science and contracting practices that are designed to protect the public.', '“They keep saying these recycled masks are still safe after all these cycles, but we don’t know that,” said a nurse in Pennsylvania, whose hospital has used Battelle’s system. “What we do know is that there are not enough masks for medical workers and there are very real consequences if we get sick.”', 'Battelle stands by its 2016 study of its technology, which used manikins rather than human subjects to determine whether masks lost their fit or were permeated by particles after 20 uses, according to company officials who responded to NBC News’ inquiries in an email. But the company also said it has only verified the purity of masks for four uses in field testing at Massachusetts General Hospital since the machines were built to respond to a pandemic. That puts health care workers in the position of being the first living experimental test subjects.', '“To date, Battelle has received and tested samples representative of four actual use cycles from MassGen,” Will Richter, Battelle’s principal research scientist, said. “The goal of this assessment is to determine the impact of actual wear.”', 'The pursuit of an all-of-the-above approach to finding medical solutions and equipment to slow the spread of the virus has perversely wasted time, money and opportunity, according to critics within the administration who spoke to NBC News on the condition of anonymity because they fear losing their jobs.', 'But some lawmakers, former government officials and a handful of current administration officials have spoken publicly in ways that echo and amplify those concerns.', '“It’s just outrageous,” Chuck Hagel, a former Republican senator from Nebraska who served as defense secretary under President Barack Obama, said in a telephone interview with NBC News. “Over the course of the last few weeks, what this administration has done, how they have done it with contracts and everything, there’s no transparency, there’s no accountability.”', 'Battelle’s sanitizers were mobilized by a task force designed to execute on Trump’s demands, despite reservations about safety and cost.', 'On March 29, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, slammed the Food and Drug Administration for limiting a waiver of safety regulations for Battelle, which is based in his state. DeWine had lobbied heavily for the waiver in the first place and was upset that the use of Battelle machines was going to be restricted.', 'At the time, Trump was highly sensitive to criticism from the nation’s governors, having said that week that they should be “appreciative” of the use of his power to help their states. DeWine went to bat for Battelle, which needed looser rules so that its machines could be deployed outside its main facility and used on more than 10,000 masks a day, according to the FDA and DeWine.', 'The upbraiding of the administration drew headlines, and DeWine said Trump promised him the ruling would be changed. The president even pressured the FDA on Twitter. The broader waiver lifting the limit was announced by the FDA within hours, and DeWine showed his appreciation by thanking Trump and FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn for intervening.', 'FDA spokesperson Brittney Manchester said that Battelle had originally asked for permission to decontaminate 10,000 masks per day at a single site and that the initial emergency waiver written March 28 covered that. The FDA revised the language after it “learned” the company wanted to use its machines “at an unlimited number of sites with no ceiling on the number of [masks] that may be decontaminated per day,” Manchester said.', 'Spokespeople for Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, who chairs the task force, declined to answer any of NBC News’ questions about the waiver for Battelle, the federal contract and the safety of masks cleaned by the company’s machines. But with the newly revised waiver in hand, Battelle worked with the task force so it could sell its machines to the government.', 'Technically, the Defense Logistics Agency, an arm of the Pentagon working with the task force, gave Battelle a “contract letter,” which allows for details of a deal to be finalized after the work starts. When DLA officials submitted a legally required justification explaining the parameters of the deal this month, they wrote that the “maximum dollar value” is now $600 million.', 'The company says it might not hit the cap.', '“As demand ebbs and flows at various sites across the country, Battelle will adjust its staffing accordingly and will bill the government only the actual costs incurred,” company spokesperson Katy Delaney said. “If the contract costs are less than the ceiling cost, then the government will not spend up to the ceiling.”', 'DLA spokesman Patrick Mackin said the $187 million of extra room is there for flexibility.“To date, the value of the contract remains at $413M,” he said in an email. “The maximum value of the contract is $600M in the event we need to make any adjustments in the support provided by Battelle during the period of performance.”', 'The task force’s deployment of mask sanitizers, several other versions of which have been given an emergency greenlight since Battelle’s went into service, are now part of a transition to a focus on boosting the economy, because the administration insists they reduce the need to supply fresh masks to health care workers. The president himself has said workers have all the equipment they need.', 'On May 6, Trump told a group of nurses at the White House that reports of PPE shortages are “fake news,” and on May 14, he said he was winding down an airlift program that brought equipment into the U.S. from overseas “because we’re very stocked up.”', 'But that’s inconsistent with the experience of many front-line workers, according to Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, which represents the second-largest number of nurses of any union in the country.', 'There’s still a shortage of PPE, she said, which means that health care workers have little choice but to use masks sanitized by the Battelle machines even though “they really believe that N95s should be used once and that’s it.”', 'It’s “not ideal” she said of the sanitization. “Is it better than nothing? Yes.”', 'In fact, Weingarten asked top union officials to create a supply chain for personal protective equipment and kept the operation a secret for several weeks until the first batch of masks, face shields and other items began to arrive earlier this month. She said she feared that the shipments would be seized or rerouted by the administration.', 'When task force leaders convened at FEMA headquarters on April 8, they faced a conflict over whether to proceed with Battelle’s contract despite the sharp price spike.', 'Trump clearly wanted the mask sanitizers to be deployed rapidly. It had only been 10 days since he tweeted his support for the FDA waiver, which allowed masks cleaned by the machines to be used in health care facilities and freed the company from existing federal quality-assurance regulations.', 'But from April 3 to April 8, the price had skyrocketed from $60 million to $413 million. An Ohio-based nonprofit corporation that pays top executives more than $1 million a year and spent $350,000 lobbying Congress and federal agencies from Jan. 1 to March 30, Battelle raised the price for each machine from $1 million to $6.8 million “due to the inclusion of operating costs for six months, shipping, and logistics tails to be covered up front,” according to a summary of the decision-making meeting that was circulated to task force members and obtained by NBC News.', 'The “logistics tail,” a term the military uses to describe the chain of goods and people supporting combat troops in war, broadly refers to the costs of providing supplies and administrative support for a project. The additional $353 million over six months for the logistics tail, which includes the price of employing and training technicians, is equivalent to the retail value of 278 million new N95 masks.', 'In addition to operating the machines, maintaining them and shipping masks back and forth to health care systems, Delaney said “each site requires things like portable restrooms, showers, protective equipment and in some cases very large tents to house the operations.”', 'Battelle has performed countless billions of dollars worth of work for the federal government since its participation in the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb. Much of its work is classified because the company manages eight nuclear labs for the Department of Energy. Battelle also offers private-sector customers in various industries a wide variety of services, including assisting with FDA approval for e-cigarettes. While it enjoys the tax exemptions of a nonprofit, it is a well-established player in the elite spheres of energy and defense contracting, and employs more than 27,000 people.', 'The company had a powerful customer in the president, and the seven-fold difference between the original estimate on April 3 and the price on April 8 appears to have bothered only one of the senior officials with a seat at the task force’s decision-making table, according to the summary of the debate.', 'That was Air Force Brig. Gen. John Bartrum, a consultant to the HHS department who oversees the agency’s financial resources, and he raised a formal objection to the task force’s board. He said the government should consider buying 10 of the machines and supporting operational costs for $80 million or $100 million. He advocated for taking time to re-evaluate whether it made sense to go in for the full load, according to the summary of the April 8 meeting.', 'His concern was consistent with those of a wide variety of federal experts on budgeting, contracting, epidemiology, disease testing, vaccine and drug-therapy development, and public health who have pushed higher-ups to step back and reconsider White House priorities — or at least take more care with taxpayers’ money.', 'For example, Dr. Rick Bright, who was the head of the federal agency in charge of developing vaccines, testified before Congress last Thursday after filing a whistleblower complaint alleging he was moved from his position in retaliation for objecting to the president’s insistence on purchasing hydroxychloroquine. The drug, which the White House pushed the task force to acquire in tens of millions of doses and which Trump said Monday he has been taking himself, has not been proven to treat Covid-19, and the FDA has issued warnings about its misuse.', 'But many experts’ voices are being drowned out by the task force’s rush to please a president whose response to the threat of coronavirus was slow and whose recommended remedies have included ingesting disinfectant.', 'Inside FEMA headquarters, Bartrum was met with resistance by the supply chain unit of the task force, which had recommended the deal in the first place, on the basis that the machines would allow front-line workers to use the same mask up to 20 times. The figure cited was based on Battelle’s study of its own product. The supply chain unit chief, John Polowczyk, has been known to brag that he has a “blank check” from the president and doesn’t care what his group has to spend to acquire goods, according to the person familiar with the task force’s work.', 'Polowczyk wasn’t present for the meeting, which included senior HHS department, Pentagon, FEMA and National Security Council officials, according to the minutes obtained by NBC News. Members of the president’s National Security Council staff joined the discussion by videoconference.', 'Bartrum was outgunned. The task force board — FEMA Director Pete Gaynor and HHS Department Assistant Secretaries Robert Kadlec and Brett Giroir — sided with Polowczyk’s team and ordered the purchase to move forward, according to the summary. (Kadlec also clashed with Bright over hydroxychloroquine.)', 'In a concession to Bartrum, the board said federal agencies should work with Battelle to see if there might be a way to deploy the machines in phases. Two days after the meeting, Battelle and the Defense Department announced the $413 million deal. Over the course of less than two weeks, Battelle had won the emergency waiver from the FDA, struck a deal with the task force, renegotiated that agreement to bring in nearly seven times as much money and released the news to the public.', 'In justifying the contracting decisions, which ended up raising the cap by another $187 million, Pentagon officials wrote that “under normal conditions, an acquisition with this level of complexity and dollar value would take approximately one year to complete under full and open competition procedures based upon Agency experience.”', 'If anyone on the task force questioned the company’s statement about the number of times its cleaning machine could treat masks for safe use was reasonable, it was not recorded in the summary of the meeting. Bartrum declined NBC News’ request for an interview through an agency spokesperson.', 'Retired Adm. Ken Carodine, who worked on logistics at the Pentagon, said in a telephone interview that defense-contracting officials frequently negotiate with companies that bid for work at one price and then jack up the total almost overnight.', '“The goal is to never leave,” he said of the practice defense companies use in raising prices to cover employing their workers on government projects for as long as possible. “If anybody should understand the cost of building personal protection equipment and understanding what the entire cost cycle looks like, it’s Battelle.”', 'Carodine lamented that Pentagon officials routinely refer to defense contract changes of hundreds of millions of dollars as “budget dust” and said that Trump removed a key safeguard with his recent firing of inspectors general who had the power to investigate aspects of the coronavirus response.', '“The last person who’s going to take a look is the inspector general,” he said.', 'Five days after the deal became public, an NIH-led study concluded that the hydrogen peroxide vapor method of decontamination is only safe for three cycles.', 'The study, conducted out by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is run by Dr. Anthony Fauci, used different methods than Battelle’s, according to Dr. Seth Judson, a University of Washington internal medicine resident who worked on the evaluation. The NIH version employed special technology to measure exposure of the virus inside masks and tried to replicate how they would maintain their fit on real people, as opposed to the manikins used in Battelle’s study.', '“Since the exposure and testing procedures are different, it is difficult to compare the results, but I think the quantitative testing on people reflects a closer to ‘real world’ situation,” Judson said in an email to NBC News. “Health care workers such as myself may wear these masks for long periods of time, and degradation is seen as masks are repeatedly donned and doffed.”', 'Battelle agrees that its 2016 study, which did not convince the FDA to approve its technology for commercial use until the president stepped in, didn’t use the same methodology as the NIH version.', '“The 2016 study simply reports visual inspections of masks,” Richter, the company scientist, said. “Filtration studies are performed using a TSI 8130A, the industry standard for aerosol performance evaluation. … Testing continues to build a data bank on different makes and models” of masks.', 'After that study was published, Battelle said, it won approval for a real-world test of its technology.', '“The overall conclusion from this study was that three cycles of decontamination did not adversely impact the fit performance,” the company said.', 'Battelle’s system is already in use by over 400 hospitals across California alone, according to state records, and several other companies have won FDA waivers to deploy mask-sanitizing machines since Battelle was granted its exemption.', 'Front-line health care workers in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Idaho and Virginia who have used masks decontaminated by the Battelle system told NBC News they are concerned about their own safety.', '“We are worried about how effective our masks are and if we’ll end up catching Covid,” said one Virginia nurse, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution. More “young healthy health care workers are getting it than the general population because we are exposed to a higher viral load.”']"

Six years later, Walmart paid $3 billion to acquire his next venture, Jet.com. Lore stayed on for four years, helping Walmart by overseeing its e-commerce division and accelerating the big-box retailer’s growth.', 'On its app, Wonder pitches itself as a “new home dining experience with a kitchen that comes to you.” ', 'It is being piloted in the northern part of Westfield, an affluent suburb that is home to many New York City transplants. Residents often move to the close-knit town in order to trade a cramped apartment for a spacious home to raise a family. Yet it’s likely that these families haven’t lost their craving for the fine dining options that are a convenient perk of city life. ', 'That’s the need Wonder is trying to fill. Its vans are outfitted with mobile kitchens, and a trained chef travels on each truck, ingredients in tow, to finish off meals once the vehicle arrives at each house. ', 'Wonder’s goal is to deliver food that’s still piping hot when it reaches the front door. It tackles the pitfalls of takeout like limp french fries. And its salads aren’t soggy, since the vegetables were only tossed in the dressing moments before.', 'Jay Zuckerman, a 47-year-old father of two who resides with his wife in the pilot area, said his family has used Wonder about six or seven times for dinner over the past few months. ', 'Each time, Wonder’s chefs have placed the meal on a foldable tray table at their door, packaged in more elegant containers than one would typically receive from a delivery elsewhere. ', '“I thought it was such a different experience, and the timing could not have been more appropriate and needed during Covid,” said Zuckerman, a fashion industry executive. “It was like ordering from a gourmet restaurant, but you don’t have the issues of waiting, and you don’t have the issues of the food not tasting good because of transportation. It was a very high-end experience.” ', 'And it’s priced, accordingly. A dinner for four might be upwards of $100, he said.', 'Wonder is sourcing its menus from top restaurants headed by celebrity chefs from across the country.

But others find the inability to select a specific delivery time to be frustrating or even a deal-breaker.  ', 'Others gripe that they aren’t able to order since they don’t live in the limited delivery area. One member of the group joked about seeing if Wonder would deliver to a blanket in Mindowaskin Park, a nearby grassy area that is within the designated zone.', 'But there are complaints, too. At the top of the list is the overwhelming presence of Wonder’s vans, which could be a sign that the business is ready to expand.

All the sudden, it’s like Gremlins — like these trucks are everywhere.” ', 'Some nights, the meals sell out quicker than others, leaving potential customers hungry and looking for a quick dinner elsewhere. A spokesperson for Wonder declined to comment to CNBC about the demand it is seeing and about its expansion plans.', 'Before the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. consumers were eating more of their meals away from home. But that behavior sharply changed when states began implementing lockdowns last year. Using their stockpiled groceries, consumers cooked their own meals. They also ordered takeout and delivery, eating their meals at the kitchen table instead of inside a restaurant.

DoorDash reported that its revenue for the quarter ended Dec. 31 more than tripled, and its stock soared when it debuted in December. Meal kit company Blue Apron had been struggling, posting quarter after quarter of losses, but finally in July it posted its first profitable quarter since it went public in 2017.

The company has already shipped tens of thousands of its chips to customers including Microsoft and Dell.', 'The Series E funding round, which comes less than a year after Graphcore raised a $150 million extension to its last round, values the company at $2.77 billion, up from $1.5 billion in 2018.', 'Graphcore CEO and co-founder Nigel Toon told CNBC in July: “We’re now at the point where we’re not really looking for venture investors in the business. We’re more interested in companies that would be long term investors and holders of the stock, perhaps, in the public markets, if we ever reach that point.”', 'At the time, Toon said going public is “ideally what we would like to do” but he stressed “lots of water still has to flow under the bridge before we get to that point.”', 'Total investment in Graphcore now stands at $710 million and the four-year-old company has $440 million of cash on hand.', 'The latest funding round was led by the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board while other new investors included private equity investor Baillie Gifford, venture capital investor Draper Esprit, as well as funds managed by Fidelity International and Schroders.', 'On Tuesday, Toon said in a statement: “Having the backing of such respected institutional investors says something very powerful about how the markets now view Graphcore. The confidence that they have in us comes from the competence we have demonstrated building our products and our business.”', 'He added: “We have created a technology that dramatically outperforms legacy processors such as GPUs, a powerful set of software tools that are tailored to the needs of AI developers, and a global sales operation that is bringing our products to market.”', 'Graphcore was founded in June 2016 in Bristol, England, by Toon and Simon Knowles, who sold their previous chip company, Icera, to Nvidia for $435 million in 2011. The pair formed the initial idea for Graphcore in a small pub called the Marlborough Tavern in Bath in January 2012.', 'Today, the company employs around 450 people in Bristol, Cambridge, London, Beijing, Oslo, Palo Alto, Seattle, and Hsinchu in Taiwan.

So, they do not need funding. They are well funded for the next several years, but they definitely have people trying to invest in the company.”', 'He added: “I don’t think that you have to take on Nvidia because the market is so huge. Taking on Nvidia is like this huge task. It’s a huge company with billions of revenue and incredible teams doing all sorts of wonderful things. I think that what Graphcore has the opportunity to do is be a very strong player in the AI microprocessor market.

According to the North Dakota Soybean Growers Association, farmers in the state contracted to sell an estimated 40 percent of the 2018 crop.', '“Storage is an issue,” said Tim McGreevy, CEO of the USA Dry Pea and Lentil Council. “Even some of the mothballed country elevators have been called back into service.

Sixty-eight percent of that went to e-commerce and delivery businesses. Meal kits alone raised $6.2 billion, and e-commerce companies raised $5.3 billion within the food tech category. The largest deal last year was an $800 million round of funding for the Chinese group-buying app for groceries, Xingsheng Youxuan.', 'The world also saw how a crisis could disrupt the normal production, processing and distribution of food. Farmers had to dump milk and produce that couldn’t be shipped or stored, and conversely brick-and-mortar groceries had empty shelves after shoppers hoarded supplies.', 'Kukutai said that drove interest in growing food in controlled environments, such as vertical farms, where yields are predictable. These indoor farms are often built closer to the urban centers where much of the produce they grow will be consumed.', 'Agtech companies raised around $5 billion across 416 deals in 2020.

He said that 2020 may have been the year we reached “peak cow.”', 'The investor expects venture funding for alternative proteins and nondairy milk to remain strong throughout 2021. “Dairy and meat are still fundamental,” he noted. “But the way we produce them has a big environmental penalty.”', 'Alternative protein start-ups raised 2.6 times the money they did in 2019, clocking $3.1 billion in funding in 2020 compared with $858.7 million the year before.', 'Similarly, plant-based milks are soaring in popularity, with millennial and younger consumers decreasing purchases of traditional dairy along with beef, poultry and pork for environmental and health reasons.', 'Strong consumer demand should help keep investor interest and capital commitments high and lead to some attractive mergers and acquisitions for rising brands, Kukutai predicted.', 'Swedish vegan food makers Oatly recently filed to go public. The company’s oat-based milk is used as a dairy alternative by Starbucks, and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz was an early investor.', 'Finistere and Pitchbook’s 2020 Agrifood Tech Investment Review also notes that new kinds of alternative protein are in the works, made from cultured cells in a lab, rather than protein from plants or farmed insects.', 'By contrast, the investor said he expects funding to slow down in the second half of 2021 for many meal-kit, e-commerce and delivery businesses. His own fund has backed players in this space, including Good Eggs and Farmer’s Fridge.', 'Online ordering habits will continue well after the pandemic, now that people have gotten used to them, Kukutai said. But many businesses in this subsector managed to pull funding forward in 2020 to meet skyrocketing demand. They should be able to get through the next year of operations without raising more.', 'Instead, he’s expecting possible IPOs, SPACs or even M&A deals among some of these in 2021.', 'In agriculture, Kukutai predicts that a renewed focus on climate change and carbon emissions will influence what investors choose to fund over the next year.', 'The largest venture round in ag-tech last year saw Indigo raise around $500 million for tech and services that help farmers capture carbon through regenerative agriculture practices and then sell carbon credits.', 'New climate-related reporting requirements and pressure from ESGs — funds that score companies based on environment, social and governance criteria, not just financials and growth potential — are forcing every kind of business to measure their environmental footprint carefully, reduce their impact where they can, and buy carbon offsets to become compliant with regulations otherwise.', 'While that means different things to different companies, in farming it’s all about carefully monitoring and controlling what you grow and the environment it grows in, the investor said.', 'In 2021, food producers are able to use more targeted technologies in the field — for example, irrigation systems that can sense what’s needed at the plant level and in the root system, and data from satellites, drones and other sensing platforms that help them predict, plan and protect what they grow.', 'As they begin using internet-connected devices in the field, they are also building large libraries of data to enable more accurate predictions on everything from yield to weather. All the tech gives farmers better control of their crops and businesses.', '“When you control the environment, there is a lot you can do to make better tasting food,” Kukutai said. “And from a safety point of view, you can also protect plants from pathogens and bugs getting into them. That means less fertilizer and other inputs to treat them, which also means you’re preventing runoff of nitrogen, too. The more targeted and controlled you can be, the more virtuous.”']"

29,That sweater you don’t like is a trillion-dollar problem for retailers. These companies want to fix it,2019-01-12T19:00:53+0000,"['As online sales boom, there’s an inevitable side effect: More merchandise is getting returned, boosting costs and complexity for retailers. ', 'The shift can be staggering. ', '“Shoppers return 5 to 10 percent of what they purchase in store but 15 to 40 percent of what they buy online,” David Sobie, co-founder and CEO of Happy Returns told CNBC.', 'Not being able to see an item in person accounts for part of the difference, but consumers also shop differently online than in-store, Sobie said. They may order multiple sizes or colors to try on at home, and then ship or take back what they don’t want, with shipping paid for by the retailer, both ways in some cases.', 'With costs mounting, understanding why shoppers return items and dealing with the logistics is a key issue that retailers are only beginning to tackle. A number of new businesses are sprouting up to try and wrangle the problem for retailers. These companies say higher rates of online shopping and more lax return policies are factors contributing to the rise of returns. However, there are more options for what to do with the returns, which can help to keep tons of unwanted items out of landfills and save retailers’ profit margins. ', 'Average return rates vary by category, but clothing and shoes bought online typically have the highest rates with 30 to 40 percent returned.', 'Eric Moriarty, vice president of B-Stock Solutions, a liquidation marketplace said as e-commerce becomes a bigger percentage of retail sales, more returns will be coming back.', '“In 2018, it will be somewhere in the area of $400 billion worth of inventory ... with $90 [billion] to $95 billion returned post-holiday,” he said.', 'In the next several years, as e-commerce grows globally, “the amount of returns is going to be over a trillion dollars a year,” Tobin Moore, CEO and co-founder of reverse logistics technology company Optoro, said.', 'Another factor adding to rising returns is more relaxed return policies. As retailers fight for market share in an increasingly competitive industry, return policies are allowing longer windows to bring back items. Also, retailers are often accepting online returns in stores, even if the items were never sold at the store. ', 'According to a Happy Returns survey, nearly three-quarters of Americans say returns are their least favorite part of shopping online, so an easy return system is crucial for retaining shoppers.', 'More items are returned during and after the holiday season than any other time of year. UPS estimates 1 million returns were made daily during December leading up to Christmas, largely from consumers that shopped early to take advantage of promotions and faster shipping options.', 'But once the returned goods are back in the hands of a retailer, less than half are resold at full-price, according to Gartner Research. That translates to retailers losing out on 10 percent of sales during the holiday season, a trend that has not improved over the last couple years, and is expected to get worse.', 'While returns are a big problem for retail, only about 30 percent of the country’s largest retailers quantify its full cost and only 23 percent use some kind of technology or software to better manage it, according to Optoro.', 'In aggregate, “retailers are losing billions and billions of dollars on the way returns are managed,” Moore said. “A lot of retailers can add 5 percent to their bottom line by better optimizing the management and resale of their returns.”', '“Many retailers end up throwing away over 25 percent of their returns,” Moore said. “Holistically, that ends up being over 5 billion pounds of goods that end up in landfills a year from returns.”', 'He estimates over the next several years that could swell to 10 billion pounds of returns in landfills around the world.', 'For the 75 percent that doesn’t go to a landfill, the condition of the returned item, the timing of when it’s returned, and its location are all key factors in determining what comes next. Some merchandise is inspected and immediately restocked. Some has to be sent for refurbishing or repackaging. Other goods go to a liquidation channel where the items are repurchased by a reseller or consumer. There are occasional scenarios where returned goods are taken apart and components are recycled, or even “upcycled,” like turning shoes into a racetrack, Moore said.', 'Return scenarios have gotten more complicated. More relaxed return policies can mean shoppers return items after a season ends, making it hard to sell a winter coat in March, for example. ', 'Plus, the internet offers retailers an “endless aisle.” That means many items are sold online only. If those purchases are returned to a store, the retailer will have a few choices: ship it back to a distribution or processing center; try to resell it as a one-off item in the store; liquidate, donate or recycle it or throw it away.', 'About 70 percent of high-end apparel can typically be restocked and resold, Moore said. If it’s a consumer electronics item or home and garden item that was sealed and isn’t anymore, or has any data on it, it has to be repackaged, refurbished and wiped of data. Only around 30 percent of those returned items can go back into stock immediately.', 'According to a spokesperson for Amazon.com, “once we receive a returned product we conduct a thorough inspection to determine if it can be sold to another customer as either ‘new’ or ‘used.’ If sellable as new, it goes back on the shelf. If we determine it can be sold as used, the team takes the necessary steps to ensure it is a quality product that customers will be happy with once purchased. We work hard to reduce the amount that goes to liquidation.”', 'Best Buy uses a number of methods to minimize the cost of returns, including selling open box items on its website and hosting a sales event for open box merchandise right after Christmas. The retailer also has a small number of Best Buy Outlets where open box and slightly damaged major appliances are sold.', 'B-Stock is another channel Best Buy uses to liquidate merchandise.', '“Retailers are looking for new ways to make money and find margin,” B-Stock’s Moriarty said. “There are macro trends making returns increase over time, and there are better mouse traps out there today that make it less costly to handle a return.”', 'B-Stock builds individual online marketplaces for retailers or brands to sell returned, liquidated or excess merchandise in bulk quantities to certified resellers. Moriarty said the volume of inventory sold on its site grew 100 percent from 2017 to 2018. In addition to Best Buy, B-Stock clients include Walmart, Amazon, Macy’s, Lowe’s, GameStop, and J.C. Penney, among others. While B-Stock offers the option for warehouse storage of merchandise at CH Robinson warehouses throughout the country, B-Stock never takes financial ownership nor logistics control of the inventory being resold.', '“Typically, our clients get a 30 to 80 percent price increase from how they used to do it,” Moriarty said, even in the online auction website format B-Stock sets up for the retailers. Retailers can restrict where a reseller can sell items. For example, they can require resellers to export the merchandise. Moriarty said much of the inventory is resold on Amazon, eBay or in other small local stores.', 'Optoro sells software platforms to retailers and brands that identify the best option for maximizing the value or lowering the cost of returned items on a case-by-case basis. Options could include restocking, refurbishing, liquidating, donating or recycling. Its clients include Target, Under Armour, Jet, BJ’s Wholesale Club, Staples, and Groupon. Optoro also has its own liquidation channels, Blinq.com, for liquidation resale to consumers, and Bulq.com, for liquidation resale to resellers.', '“We can increase a retailer or brand’s return recovery amount, in many cases, by 25 percent. If it is items that are not going back in stock, we can double or triple the recovery in some cases,” Moore said.', 'Happy Returns offers technologies and logistics at nearly 300 U.S. locations to allow online purchases to be returned in person when the retailer doesn’t have a physical store. Direct-to-consumer brand start-ups like Everlane, Untuckit and Rothy’s work with Happy Returns, which has put its so-called return bars in malls, on college campuses and even stores like Sur La Table and Paper Source. Happy Returns packages it up for the shopper, sorts the returns by retailer, then ships in bulk to return hubs less expensively than the postal service offers.', '“In aggregate, Happy Returns sees a cost savings upwards of 25 percent for our retailers,” said Happy Returns’ Sobie. He attributes this to the combination of hard cost savings of its network compared to shipping and the soft savings of lowering customer service inquires.', 'While there are technologies to reduce returns like 3D body scanning and other fit innovations, “it’s not working,” Sobie said.', 'Keeping shoppers happy is harder to quantify, but extremely valuable.', '“Returns is a battleground for customers,” Moore said. “It’s a way to win more customers, to get them coming back and to get data so that you know how to better stock items and better make items for your customers as well.”']"
30,"Here’s how Apple’s AirTag trackers compare to Tile, and why the company is so upset with Apple",2021-04-27T12:52:01+0000,"['Apple’s $29 AirTag lost item tracker begins shipping on April 30. I walked through what it’s like last week, but I recently bought a similar tracker from Tile.', 'Tile has been in the lost item tracking business for several years, and now counts Apple as its closest competitor.', 'I took both devices for a test drive to show you how they differ and to help explain why Tile is so upset that Apple is moving in on its turf.', 'Tile trackers aren’t new. They’ve been around for years and have been leading the market. Owners seem to love them. They’re convenient because you can attach them to bags, keys or other items, and then see where they are on a map on your phone.', 'Like AirTag, Tile trackers don’t use GPS. Instead, they rely on a network of other Tile devices that communicate with each other over Bluetooth. So, the more Tile devices there are out there, the greater your chances that someone with a Tile passes by yours and alerts your phone of your lost item’s location. Tile has sold more than 35 million devices, not including products from more than 30 partners with its technology built-in, which make up its network that spans 195 countries.', 'Apple’s AirTag is similar, except it taps into not only other AirTags but also Apple’s existing network of iPhones and Macs, which is nearing a billion devices. That gives Apple an advantage over Tile from the get-go, since it has a bigger network at launch, even if lots of people don’t buy an AirTag.', 'Here are a few of the things I like about Tile that you don’t get with Apple AirTag:', 'But the biggest difference is the experience. AirTag is a lot more seamless since you just pull the battery tag and click “connect” on your iPhone.', 'With Tile, you need to download a separate app, instead of using Apple’s Find My, which comes pre-installed on all of its devices, then give the app permission to use your location twice during setup. It’s something Tile has complained to Congress about because the company thinks Apple’s own product has the advantage here.', 'And while Apple’s Find My network is open to other companies that want to support it, it’s not in Tile’s best interest to do so.', 'Tile, for example, lets you find lost devices nearby and far away for free. But its subscription services, including Premium ($2.99/month or $29.99 a year) and Premium Protect ($99.99 a year), rely on its network, not Apple’s. That’s why it probably isn’t as excited to launch devices that support Apple Find My as companies that aren’t in the tracking space at all.', 'The Premium plan can help you get smart alerts if you leave something behind, includes a free battery replacement, lets you share a tracker’s location with friends, shows a 30-day location history and more. Premium Protect includes those features and offers up to a $1,000 item reimbursement if you can’t find it, so it’s kind of like an insurance program for your stuff.', 'AirTag owners who use an iPhone 11 or iPhone 12 model also get another advantage from AirTag. Those phones can locate the AirTag right down to its exact location using an ultra-wideband signal. You just hold up your phone and it points you in which direction to walk to find your lost item. Tile doesn’t have access to this part of the iPhone, even though it developed support for its trackers, so it can’t offer this feature. It’s one of the complaints the company has had with Apple rolling out its own tracking product and it brought this up just last week with Congress.', 'Another differentiator: AirTag also has privacy controls. It will alert you if someone else’s AirTag seems to be with you, instead of with them, for too long. That might help prevent people from using them to track you.', 'It’s up to you which one to buy. I like the sticker and form factors of Tile and that I can ring my phone by pressing a button on it. It also works on Android, which is a big benefit. Apple’s AirTag is a hair faster to set up, has ultra-wideband, and it has a bigger network that might make it easier to find your lost device since there are more people with iPhones and Macs than Tile trackers.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.

32,Target’s holiday sales could get a boost from Chip and Joanna Gaines’ new collection,2017-10-23T05:01:00+0000,"['Last holiday season marked a turning point for Target.', 'After several quarters of choppy performance, sales and profit fell in the holiday quarter, forcing the retailer to take a deeper look at its operations. The result: it launched a new strategy to spend $7 billion over three years to build new stores and remodel existing ones, and improve both its digital and in-store experience.', '“We are going into the fourth quarter with a lot of optimism and a lot of confidence,” said Rick Gomez, Target’s chief marketing officer. His tone is upbeat compared to the retailer’s most recent guidance for the key fourth quarter. Target expects the quarter’s comparable sales to be in line with the performance of the first and second quarter, or a range of negative 1.3 percent to positive 1.3 percent.', 'The retailer needs the holiday to be a bullseye, as it gets about 30 percent of its annual sales in the fourth quarter, and it’s hinging hope on Chip and Joanna Gaines.', 'The founders of the Magnolia company certainly seem to draw a crowd to their hit HGTV show “Fixer Upper” and their Silos market in Waco, Texas. The lovable home-renovation-and-design couple’s exclusive Target “Hearth & Hand” collection launches Nov. 5.', 'Target Chief Merchandising Officer Mark Tritton expects “Hearth & Hand” will prompt additional shopping trips and boost traffic to both the stores and website.', '“The initial response has been exponential,” Tritton said. He characterized site visits to the web page built to announce the collection as “off the charts. Two to three times traffic for anything else we have done.”', 'In fact, Target is building a new physical space to house the brand’s tabletop, home decor, and “giftable” items, like a dollhouse and toy workbench, in 550 stores, and configuring a smaller, slightly different set-up in the others. ', '“Hearth & Hand” is one of the eight Target brands that will be available for the first time this holiday season. Big exclusive brands are key components for Target’s success. One example is the 15-month-brand Cat & Jack. The children’s apparel brand is already worth $2.1 billion, said  CEO Brian Cornell.', 'The big box retailer is again getting rid of its $35 minimum for free shipping, though for a slightly shorter period of time. This year, free shipping runs from Nov. 1 until Dec. 23, while last year it ran from Oct. 25 until Jan. 1.', 'Helping shoppers with gifts is high on Target’s priority list this year, with offers like the new “GiftNow” option online. Mike McNamara, Target’s chief information and digital officer said that it’s perfect when you aren’t sure exactly what to get, but you want to at least try to pick something. Shoppers give an “electronic gift box” and then the recipient can choose to accept the selected gift, or change the color or size for instance, before it’s shipped.', 'The retailer also has 1,700 gift ideas for consumers, most under $15, and most unique to Target.', 'Target has also increased the number of stores fulfilling online orders this holiday season to 1,400 from 1,100 last year. That means nearly three-quarters of its stores are able to ship products with the goal of getting goods to shoppers faster and more efficiently.', 'McNamara is trying to capture that “Tar-jay” magic online for the holidays and beyond. “If we can focus on just ‘being Target’ online, I know we can win in fourth quarter and the year.”', 'While Target had 10 Days of Deals each of the last two holiday seasons, interest waned in 2016 over the year prior. So this year, the retailer is going to offer Weekend Deals starting in mid-November, but it was mum on specifics other than to say it would vary from “household essentials to holiday must-haves.”', 'Toys are a key part of Target’s holiday plan, with half of the retailer’s total annual toy sales coming in the fourth quarter. The big box retailer will have more than 1,400 new and exclusive toys — down from 1,800 last year — and 70-plus board games shoppers can only get at Target like Bob Ross: The Art of Chill, Netflix “Stranger Things” toys and lots of Star Wars products. ', 'Family pajama sets have been a hit for Target, thanks in part to the desire to share photos on social media. In 2016, holiday pajama sales grew double-digits over the year prior. This year, Target’s expanding the family options to include matching pjs for the family dog and children’s dolls.', 'Correction: This story was revised to state that Target’s free shipping offer runs from Nov. 1 to Dec. 23.']"
33,Jeff Bezos unveils lunar lander to take astronauts to the moon by 2024,2019-05-09T20:42:57+0000,"['WASHINGTON — Jeff Bezos, chairman of Amazon and founder of Blue Origin, unveiled his space company’s lunar lander for the first time on Thursday.', '“This vehicle is going to the moon,” Bezos said during an invite-only presentation to media and space industry executives.', '“We were given a gift — this nearby body called the moon,” Bezos said. He added that the moon is a good place to begin manufacturing in space due to its lower gravity than the Earth. Getting resources from the moon “takes 24 times less energy to get it off the surface compared to the Earth,” Bezos said, and “that is a huge lever.”', 'The Blue Moon lander can bring 3.6 metric tons to the lunar surface, according to Bezos.', 'Bezos also unveiled the company’s BE-7 rocket engine at the event. The engine will be test fired for the first time this summer, Bezos said. It’s largely made of “printed” parts, he added.', '“We need the new engine and that’s what this is,” Bezos said.', 'BE-7 photo', '“It’s time to go back to the moon and this time stay,” Bezos said.', 'Blue Origin, established nearly two decades ago, has remained relatively quiet about the rockets, engines and capsules it is developing. With its Latin tagline of “step by step, ferociously,” Blue Origin has been working on multiple space systems at the same time. Bezos invests more than $1 billion in the company each year, through sales of his Amazon shares.', 'Vice President Mike Pence earlier this year directed NASA to return U.S. astronauts to the surface of the moon within the next five years. NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine answered by saying the agency will meet the White House’s directive, which represents an acceleration of NASA’s existing lunar exploration timeline. NASA’s fiscal 2020 budget request included a massive increase in funding of the the Advanced Cislunar and Surface Capabilities (ACSC) program. Under ACSC, the agency would first send robots to the surface without crews, later following up with astronauts. Despite internal hesitancy, NASA is considering commercial alternatives such as Blue Origin for getting astronauts to the moon’s surface.', '“I love Vice President Pence’s 2024 lunar landing goal,” Bezos said, adding that Blue Origin can meet that timeline “because we started this three years ago.”', 'Ahead of the event, Blue Origin tweeted a cryptic photo of famed explorer Ernest Shackleton’s ship and a date, May 9, in the caption. A teaser for Thursday’s event, the photo appeared to hint that Bezos’ announcement would focus on sending cargo and even astronauts to the south pole of the moon. That’s because Shackelton lends his name to a crater on the moon’s surface, which NASA named after the explorer in 2006 due to its potential as a lunar outpost. Located at the moon’s south pole, the Shackleton crater is believed by many to have deposits of frozen water.', 'Bezos offered only few details two years ago about Blue Origin’s lunar ambitions. In a program the company called “Blue Moon,” it would send a couple tons of cargo to the surface of the moon, to begin building the infrastructure of a lunar base. The first mission was proposed for 2020, in partnership with government programs like the Boeing-built NASA Space Launch System (SLS) rocket. But in May of last year, Bezos indicated Blue Origin may develop Blue Moon on its own.', 'Blue Origin’s most visible program has been its New Shepard rocket system, which the company is developing to send tourists to the edge of space for 10 minutes. New Shepard has flown on 11 test flights, with its capsule, built to carry six passengers, reaching an altitude of more than 350,000. The capsule features massive windows, providing expansive views of the Earth once in space.', 'The company plans to send its first humans onboard a New Shepard rocket sometime in the next year. But it has yet to begin selling tickets. Blue Origin told CNBC last year that it will only offer tourists a ride to space “after our first human flights.”', 'Additionally, New Shepard has served as a test bed for the company to develop its own reusability system. Like SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rockets, the largest part of the New Shepard rocket — the first stage “booster” — comes back and lands on a concrete pad shortly after launch.', 'Reusing rockets is a key development in the space industry as companies look to reduce the cost of sending humans, satellites, experiments and more to space. Blue Origin is building an immense rocket system, called New Glenn. Similar to New Shepard, the company plans to land New Glenn’s rocket booster on a ship in the ocean', 'Bezos’ ultimate ambition is to help humanity expand across the solar system, with a human population of more than a trillion living and working in space. Morgan Stanley highlighted Bezos’ investments in space as a “force” in the industry who brings financial muscle unlike any other. Blue Origin is one of several space companies which Morgan Stanley said “will up the ante” this year.']"

Kuo is known for accurately predicting Apple hardware releases before they are official because he keeps such close tabs on the company’s supply chain.', 'In 2022, Apple’s high-end “pro” models could include a new design with a “punch-hole” display for the front-facing camera, instead of the notch on current devices. These phones could also be equipped with a 48-megapixel wide-lens camera, Kuo wrote. That would mean much sharper images.', 'Apple could also release new lower-cost iPhones next year, Kuo wrote, including a less expensive iPhone SE with 5G connectivity. The current model SE retails for $399. Apple is also working on a “more affordable” iPhone with a 6.7-inch screen, Kuo said. Apple’s current phone with that size screen, the iPhone 13 Pro Max, retails for $1,099 or more.', 'Kuo warned that all these predictions depend on Apple’s and its suppliers’ development process and that he had previously predicted some of these devices would release sooner.', '“We predict that the new 2H23 iPhone will support under-display fingerprint,” Kuo wrote, using a term for the second half of 2023. “However, the foldable design may be the most critical selling point for high-end smartphones by then, so we still need to monitor the contribution of the under-display fingerprint to the shipment of the new 2H23 iPhone.”', 'Apple investors are curious whether this year’s iPhones can continue to grow sales despite new models with marginal improvements such as better battery life. The iPhone 12 has been a hot seller. IPhone revenue was up 50% year-over-year last quarter.', 'Ultimately, Kuo expects 16% year-over-year growth in terms of the number of iPhones shipped in 2022, which would be mostly iPhone 13 sales, and 5%-7% growth in 2023.', 'This year, preorders for the iPhone 13 reflect higher demand than last year’s preorders for iPhone 12 models, Kuo said. Apple’s new iPhones will hit store shelves Friday, and preorders opened last week for customers who want to receive their devices on the first day. The delivery estimates on Apple’s website for preordered iPhones are a useful tool to gauge consumer demand for the new devices, Kuo wrote.', 'Preorder demand is higher for the more expensive new models, the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max, which start at $999 instead of $699 for the mainstream models, Kuo said.', 'Although Apple has warned about issues getting the parts that it needs to build its devices in the current quarter, Kuo believes that Apple has increased production for its high-end devices and that supply is better than last year because the company addressed a shortage of telephoto camera parts.']"

41,"Amazon, Panasonic, and recycling start-ups prepare for battery wave tsunami ",2020-12-12T15:00:02+0000,"['Inside every smartphone and tablet lies a dense brick with a dark and complex history: its battery. The lithium that ferries charge back and forth likely started out in South American salt flats, where months of evaporation consumes millions of tons of water in some of the world’s driest regions. The cobalt that buffers the material against the ravages of daily recharging probably came from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where children have allegedly been maimed and killed extracting it from the ground. To gather the assorted atoms and fashion them into a working battery may have required thousands of people from perhaps a dozen countries. Then, after a few years of use, spent devices often end up in landfills and incinerators. ', 'As lithium-ion batteries stand poised to jump from handheld devices into cars, trucks, and homes, entrepreneurs and academics are racing to find a way to reuse the hard-won materials. Investors are betting millions that a Nevada company, Redwood Materials, can mine electronic waste for metals. A competitor, Li-Cycle, aims to crack the logistical puzzle of transporting batteries. Others are developing the technology to rejuvenate dead batteries without breaking them down fully. By attacking the problem on all fronts, the teams work toward one goal: transforming exhausted batteries into a valuable resource.', '“We’re spending all of this money making batteries, making chemicals, and then we’re burning them at the end of the cycle,” says Tim Johnston, Li-Cycle co-founder and executive chairman. “That’s not right.”', 'Industry insiders speak with excitement and trepidation of a looming battery “tsunami.” Globally people already toss out more than 500,000 tons of lithium batteries today, according to Ajay Kochhar, Li-Cycle co-founder and president, mostly in the form of small electronics. But as the world transitions to an electric economy, its appetite for lithium-ion bricks is projected to increase tenfold by 2030. Most of that explosion will be driven by electric vehicles, which carry batteries weighing more than 1,000 pounds. “We’re at the tip of the iceberg,” Kochhar says.', 'Kochhar and others see that problem as an opportunity to replace today’s fragile and problematic supply chain with a more “circular” system, one that builds the next generation of batteries from the materials of the last generation. And they won’t be recycling just for the sake of recycling. The market for recycling lithium-ion batteries alone could be worth $18 billion annually by 2030, Statista estimates, up from $1.5 billion in 2019.  ', 'One start-up leading the U.S. market is Redwood Materials, the latest venture of Tesla co-founder JB Straubel. During the 16 years he spent working as Tesla’s CTO, Straubel realized that there was no plan for processing the cars at the end of their lifespan. And unlike a phone, a half-ton car battery can’t just languish at the back of a junk drawer. Most electric vehicles are currently in their prime (Straubel drives what he believes is the oldest Tesla on the planet — a Roadster prototype from the late 2000s), but the tsunami will begin when early electric cars will start retiring en masse in the next five years.', 'Since launching in 2017, Redwood Materials has been preparing for that first wave. Located in Carson City, the start-up’s two facilities currently handle all the waste materials and defective batteries coming out of the nearby Tesla Gigafactory, co-owned by Panasonic. Panasonic scrap alone provides about one gigawatt of material annually and a dozen other partners contribute a similar amount, for a total equivalent of about 20,000 tons of material per year. The company also recently partnered with Amazon to dispose of batteries from the retail giant.', 'After sorting recent arrivals, the company uses proprietary processes involving a combination of burning batteries to melt their contents and submerging them in liquids that leach out desired elements (although the exact procedure is tailored to fit the battery type). In the end, a PR spokesperson said, the techniques recover 95% to 98% of a battery’s nickel, cobalt, aluminum, graphite, and more than 80% of its lithium. Much of those materials are sold back to Panasonic to make new Tesla batteries.', '“Redwood Materials has assembled an excellent team that is working collaboratively with us to tackle a wide range of waste streams, and to develop raw materials that we can then use in our cell making processes,” says Celina Mikolajczak, v.p. of battery technology, Panasonic Energy of North America.', 'The company is currently working on increasing the capacity of its Carson City facilities with the help of $40 million in funding from Capricorn Investment Group and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, an environmental investment fund including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.', 'Johnston and Kochhar came to found Li-Cycle in a similar way, launching it in 2016 after working together at Hatch, a global engineering firm specializing in battery chemicals. They’ve structured their business around a ‘hub and spoke’ model.', 'Because batteries are fire hazards, they can be expensive to transport safely. To keep distances down, Li-Cycle intends to collect batteries at local “spoke” facilities, which shred the bricks into three components: plastic casings, mixed metals (such as foils), and the active materials like cobalt and nickel at the battery’s heart — a dark dust known as “black mass.”', 'Li-Cycle can sell these materials directly or ship the black mass to a central “hub” factory and immerse it in liquids at room temperature that Johnston says extract the metals at 90% to 95% efficiency — even lithium, which many processes struggle to capture efficiently.  ', 'The company currently has two spokes running, one in Ontario, Canada and one in Rochester, New York, which can break apart a combined 10,000 tons of lithium-ion batteries each year. Li-Cycle recently announced plans to build their first hub, also in Rochester, which will be able to separate 25,000 tons of black mass (from 65,000 tons of batteries) annually into lithium, cobalt, nickel, and other elements starting in late 2022. Like Redwood Materials, the company hopes to expand as quickly as possible, having raised about $50 million in funding so far.', '“This is a big space, and we need an army of recyclers,” Kochhar says.', 'But looking ahead, researchers note that the long-term margins of scavenging batteries for their atomic parts may prove punishingly thin. The chemical structure of batteries shifts from year to year — Panasonic slashed the cobalt content in Tesla batteries by 60% between 2012 and 2018, for instance. These changes may require continuously tweaking the recycling process while also making it less lucrative (Cobalt is the most expensive, and valuable, battery element).', 'A more efficient route may be to recycle batteries at a higher level, salvaging their larger molecular structure as opposed to their atoms. Steve Sloop, a chemist and founder of a battery research firm called OnTo Technology, likens a battery to an apartment building. Rather than knock it down for wood and brick, why not renovate? “A lot of energy is invested in making [batteries],” he says. “We’re trying to save that investment.”', 'In the case of lithium-ion batteries, that means replacing the lithium, a little bit of which gets stuck to the battery’s molecular scaffolding during every charge and discharge. When the battery runs out of freely flowing lithium, it dies. In September, Sloop published a case study describing how his lab automatically disassembled and shredded recalled Apple batteries, soaking their active materials in a lithium-rich bath to restore them to pristine condition. The final product marked the first full fuel cell re-assembled from an industrial source.', 'And OnTo Technology is just one group pursuing this “direct recycling” strategy. The Department of Energy funds a research consortium called the ReCell Center, which supports similar projects. The center is currently organizing an informal competition between several different types of “re-lithiation” to see which performs best, according to Linda Gaines, a transportation systems analyst at Argonne National Laboratory, which is leading the effort.  ', '“Re-lithiation has come a long way,” she says. “It really is at the stage where we can think about scaling up.”', 'Scaling up will be the major challenge all these initiatives face. In the lab, reducing batteries to atoms, or replacing lithium, is relatively easy. But how to collect, transport, sort, disassemble, process, and redistribute the millions of tons of materials that are coming is anything but.', '“This is a new technology that’s coming to market,” says Gavin Harper, a materials scientist at the University of Birmingham who is involved with ReLib, a UK battery recycling project. “We haven’t seen the problems and the challenges and also the opportunities that it’s going to create.”']"

43,How expired food still ends up on Amazon and what’s being done to stop it,2020-03-07T14:01:01+0000,"['A CNBC analysis in October found that Amazon was shipping expired food items from third-party sellers to people shopping on the site’s Grocery & Gourmet section. Four months later, the sellers are still active and more than half of them have had new complaints about expired products, even as regulation begins to catch up.', 'Since Amazon bought Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in 2017, it’s become an ever-bigger player in the $800 billion grocery market. It offers free 2-hour grocery delivery with Amazon Fresh and cashierless Amazon Go convenience stores in four cities. A full-size cashierless supermarket store recently opened in Seattle and another is set to open in Los Angeles this year.', 'But there’s also an entire section of food sold through Amazon’s regular e-commerce platform. It’s called Grocery & Gourmet, and it launched in 2006, selling 14,000 “dry” grocery products. Today, it has hundreds of thousands of items, sold by millions of third-party sellers.', 'The downside to the convenience created by Amazon’s huge marketplace is that some of these food items are falling through the cracks of Amazon’s strict regulations. The CNBC analysis found expired hot sauce, beef jerky, granola bars, Doritos, coffee creamer and baby food.', '3PM Solutions, a data analytics firm that specializes in e-commerce, analyzed Amazon’s 100 best-selling food products for CNBC in October. Of the sellers that had over 1,000 customer reviews in the last year, 40% had more than five customer complaints about expired goods.', 'Almost four months later, 3PM found that all these sellers are still active, and at least 50% of them have had more customer complaints of selling expired products since the initial story in October. Amazon told CNBC that this happens in very isolated incidents.', '3PM says it noticed a pattern among 150 million customer reviews of more than 2 million third-party sellers.', 'Tweet', '“When a consumer gets an expired product, it not only damages their faith in the brand and the work that the brands put into building a great product, but it also damages the consumer’s trust in Amazon,” said former Amazon product safety program manager Rachel Johnson Greer, now an Amazon Marketplace Strategist for Cascadia Seller Solutions. “So hopefully Amazon will fix this and will make it easier to find these expired products and to manage food, not only for the consumer, which they should be doing before anyway, but also for themselves and the brand.”', 'When Congress passed the Food Safety Modernization Act in 2011, Rachel Johnson Greer’s job at Amazon was to bring its food storage and handling procedures into compliance. She told CNBC she saw tubs of gummies melted together on the top shelves of warehouses that had reached 120 degrees, and instances where Tide laundry detergent was stored next to oatmeal that had absorbed the chemical smell.', 'In a statement, Amazon told CNBC that, “We work hard to provide customers with a great shopping experience, and that includes receiving products in the condition they expect and with sufficient shelf life. We require selling partners to abide by strict product quality guidelines and our teams have robust proactive systems in place to prevent expired goods from being shipped to customers.”', '“We also use a combination of artificial intelligence and manual processes to monitor over 20 million pieces of customer feedback we receive weekly for any concerns,” the Amazon spokesperson said. “If one arises, we work quickly to investigate, take the appropriate actions and use this information to improve our systems. Appropriate actions include warning, suspending or terminating a bad actor’s account. If customers have a concern with a potentially expired product, we encourage them to contact our Customer Service directly for a full refund of their purchase.”', 'This problem persists, in part, because regulation is sparse. The Food and Drug Administration told CNBC that ”’best-by” or “sell-by” dates are not required under federal law, with the exception of infant formula. The FDA calls expiration dates “manufacturer quality dates” that “are not indicative of the safety of the product.” ', 'Amazon is also regulated differently than its brick-and-mortar competitors. If a traditional grocery store sells a defective product, the store can be sued alongside the company that made the product, and that liability means conventional retailers are careful about the products they stock. But Amazon has successfully avoided liability in court by arguing it’s a platform for the sale of goods, rather than a seller.', '“Historically, courts have found that Amazon is not liable for items sold by the third party sellers on the platform. The legal theory is that Amazon was just providing the space like a flea market and the individual sellers were actually liable for the goods they sold and not Amazon,” said trademark lawyer Josh Gerben.', 'A bill introduced in the House on Monday may change this. A group of four representatives, two Republicans and two Democrats, introduced the SHOP SAFE Act, outlining a plan to create liability for online marketplaces like Amazon if they don’t have specific safeguards in place.', 'In January, the Department of Homeland Security issued a report that requires Amazon and other e-commerce platforms to turn over information about third-party sellers and warns the online platforms could face “civil fines, penalties, and injunctive actions” for selling counterfeit or pirated goods.', '“Amazon takes product safety really seriously. The problem is just how big Amazon is. And it just is really difficult to police a system that big effectively,” Greer said.', 'Watch the video to see how expired food ends up on Amazon, and what’s being done to cut back on the problem.']"

On Sept. 30, 1938, when the perils posed by Adolf Hitler were already apparent, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, French Premier Edouard Daladier, and Italian leader Benito Mussolini signed the Munich Pact, which handed Nazi Germany large parts of Czechoslovakia in the name of peace.', 'There’s an unwritten rule among serious historians and journalists: No one and nothing should be compared to Hitler and the Third Reich, a singular personality and episode of evil. No direct comparison is reasonable or useful. Russians suffered more fatalities than any other people from what became known as the “Munich Betrayal” and the world war that was to come.', 'Still, there is a Munich lesson for how to respond to Putin today. Appeasement’s price is always high. It encourages malevolent actors to escalate their ambitions as they calculate what they wish to achieve against reduced risk and resistance.', 'Russia’s invasion of Georgia in 2008, and the de facto annexation of its two breakaway provinces, was followed by the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, the first forceful changing of European borders since World War II. Then there was Moscow’s intervening in Syria to prop up murderous dictator Bassar al Assad in 2015, which was followed by Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. elections.', 'Western intelligence services – mostly caught by surprise by these events – have been gaming what the Russian leader might do next. It was a safe bet that it would fall within his campaigns to rebuild regional influence or to undermine the United States, its European allies, and their democracies and primary institutions, NATO and the European Union, while blocking their ability to accept new members from Moscow’s neighborhood.', 'Part of the answer came last weekend.', 'Two aspects of Russia’s military action were significant. First, it was the first time that Putin had so brazenly used his own conventional military forces against Ukraine, where he has acted mostly in the shadows or through proxies. Second, by firing upon Ukrainian vessels, he must have factored in a potential chain of events that might have led to a wider war.', 'President Donald Trump’s tweet on Thursday that he wouldn’t meet with Putin this weekend on the margins of the G-20 in Argentina was encouraging but insufficient.', 'In an interview with the German-language Bild Zeitung, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko this week warned, “The only language [Putin] understands is the solidarity of the Western world. We can’t accept Russia’s aggressive policies. First it was Crimea, then eastern Ukraine, now he wants the Sea of Azov.”', 'Here’s a brief guide to what has happened and what should be done, providing context and a range of responses recommended by Atlantic Council experts:', 'In 2003, Russia and Ukraine reached agreement on cooperation in the shared waterways of the Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait, which runs between Russia and Crimea as the only entrance to the sea.', 'After Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2014, it used its new control of both sides of the strait to build a $3.7 billion bridge connecting Crimea to mainland Russia. Its low height of 115 feet cut off access of larger ships to the Ukrainian ports of Mariupol and Berdyansk, resulting in a sharp decline of port revenues.', 'In May of this year, following the bridge’s completion, Russia moved naval vessels, including warships from its Caspian Flotilla, to the Sea of Azov. Since then, Russia has detained some 150 Ukrainian and foreign merchant ships and interrogated their crew members, according to a Ukrainian official and port authorities, deterring more ship traffic and further cutting revenues.', 'Last Sunday, Russian forces opened fire and seized three Ukrainian naval ships after rebuffing their attempt to travel from the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov through the Kerch Strait. Russian troops detained 24 Ukrainian crew members, six of whom were injured, and have now transferred them to Moscow for criminal prosecution.', 'The United States, European allies, the European Union, and NATO have condemned the Kremlin’s aggression against Ukraine. Without more than that, however, Putin won’t be deterred.', 'Atlantic Council experts favor a three-pronged, diplomatic, economic, and military response, including but not limited to the following:', '- Diplomatically, the U.S., NATO, the EU, and other western allies should not only condemn the Russian actions but also detail how they violate specific international conventions. There should be demands that Russia apologize, punish those responsible, and immediately release the Ukrainian sailors.', 'Russia should permit Ukrainian shipping free access to the Sea of Azov, in accordance with the 2003 agreement. The NATO and EU should jointly send a fact-finding mission to the Sea of Azov.', '- Economically, the United States and Europe should more stringently enforce the already existing sanctions imposed following Russia’s annexation of Crimea, since that is the source of the problem. They should then prepare new sanctions on Russian financial institutions and shipping interests, to be implemented if Russia doesn’t reverse course.', 'To impose even greater costs, the U.S. should push Germany to suspend the ill-conceived Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany via the Baltic Sea. Once operational, Nord Stream 2 — which bypasses Ukraine — will cost Ukraine a 3 percent drop in GDP. Russia’s multiple provocations undermine European efforts to obtain guarantees of continued gas transit through Ukraine after Nord Stream 2 comes on line.', '- Given the more direct Russian military involvement, it’s also time to increase surveillance and other monitoring of the Sea of Azov by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and Western drones. A stronger message would be to widen NATO and U.S. military presence in the eastern Black Sea by increasing freedom of navigation operations.', 'Finally, the U.S. and allies should provide additional defensive naval armaments to Ukraine, including coastal defense surface-to-ship missiles, patrol boats, radar, and additional intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets.', 'Critics might argue that such actions would be provocative. History has taught us, however, that appeasement is the most inflammatory action.', 'That is the lasting lesson of Munich.', 'Frederick Kempe is a best-selling author, prize-winning journalist and president & CEO of the Atlantic Council, one of the United States’ most influential think tanks on global affairs.

46,SpaceX is set to launch four nonprofessional astronauts to orbit: Here’s what you should know,2021-09-15T16:04:59+0000,"['KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. — Elon Musk’s SpaceX is set to make history with a launch of four civilians in what would be the first full crew of nonprofessional astronauts to fly to space.', 'The mission, known as Inspiration4, is scheduled to lift off Wednesday night, with a five-hour window that opens at 8:02 p.m. ET.', 'The mission is the creation of SpaceX and billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, 38-year-old founder and CEO of Shift4 Payments. Isaacman purchased the multiday flight from SpaceX for an undisclosed fee, with the goal of raising awareness and funding for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.', '“This is significant and historic because it’s going to be the highest that any humans have gone into orbit since the Hubble [Space Telescope] servicing missions,” SpaceX senior director of human spaceflight Benji Reed told reporters Tuesday. The last Hubble servicing mission was in May 2009. “Another historic part for SpaceX is that this will be the first time that we have three [Dragon capsules] in orbit.”', 'Isaacman and the Inspiration4 team have worked with SpaceX to train since announcing the flight in February. He noted that the crew on Tuesday met with company leadership — including Musk, who “gave us his assurances again that the entire leadership team is solely focused on this mission.”', 'Asked how he felt with less than 24 hours to liftoff, Isaacman said he had “no jitters, excited to get going.”', 'SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule was developed with heavy investment from NASA, which has flown 10 of its professional astronauts on the spacecraft. While the space agency has comparatively minimal involvement in the Inspiration4 launch, NASA director of commercial spaceflight Phil McAlister told CNBC that private missions were one of the goals set when contributing government funds to SpaceX’s vehicle.', '“We are seeing a sort of renaissance in commercial orbital human space transportation,” McAlister said. “For the first time in human history, you can go to a private company and purchase a ticket to orbit. You’ve never been able to do that; historically, you had to go to a government agency.”', 'One of the key factors for launching on Wednesday night remains the temperamental Florida weather, which will affect the timing of liftoff and the capsule’s splashdown a few days later.', '“We look at not only the launch weather but we have to look at the return weather,” Reed said.', 'The U.S. Space Force’s 45th Space Wing forecast that the weather has a 80% probability of being clear to launch during Wednesday’s five-hour window. If SpaceX decides to postpone the launch, the next available opportunity would be Thursday.', 'SpaceX will broadcast steady live coverage of the launch, from four hours before liftoff to until the spacecraft reaches orbit.', 'Isaacman gathered a unique group of individuals for the mission through three ways: from St. Jude’s staff, through an entrepreneurial competition, and via a charity lottery.', 'Isaacman, the Inspiration4 commander, founded his payment processing company in 1999 when he was 16. He’s also an avid pilot, with a variety of ratings in commercial and military jets. He has flown in more than 100 airshows and is co-founder of Draken International, a private aerospace company that helps train pilots for the U.S. military.', 'Hayley Arceneaux, a cancer survivor and now a physician assistant at St. Jude, is the mission’s medical officer.', 'She survived osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer, at age 10 and will be the first person to fly in space with a prosthetic body part — as a significant portion of her leg is metal. At 29, Arceneaux will also become the youngest American to fly in space.', '“From a medical officer perspective, I’m so excited about the medical research that we’re going to be doing — we’re going to be collecting a lot of swabs to learn about the microbiome, how that changes in flight; we’re going to be performing ultrasounds to evaluate for fluid shifts; as well as performance and cognitive tests and studying radiation effects of going to our high altitude,” Arceneaux told reporters.', 'Sian Proctor, 51, the Inspiration4 pilot, joined the crew after winning an online business competition through Isaacman’s company.', 'She is a geoscientist and science communication specialist, with a passion for space exploration that extends back to her childhood: She was born in Guam while her father worked for a NASA ground station during the Apollo missions. Proctor is an analog astronaut, having completed multiple Earth-based missions that simulate the isolation of living in space. In 2009, Proctor was a finalist for NASA’s 2009 astronaut selection.', '“It’s really special for me to hold that title [of pilot] because I’m going to be the first Black female pilot of a spacecraft,” Proctor told reporters. “There have been three Black female astronauts that have made it to space, and knowing that I’m going to be the fourth means that I have this opportunity to not only accomplish my dream, but also inspire the next generation of women of color and girls of color and really get them to think about reaching for the stars.”', 'The fourth member of the crew is mission specialist Chris Sembroski, who donated to the St. Jude fundraising campaign and was selected from among nearly 72,000 entries.', 'Sembroski, 42, is an Air Force veteran who served in Iraq.', '“I’ve been just thinking about how lucky I am to be a part of this crew, to be a part of this mission. From watching a Super Bowl commercial and making a donation, to not winning that and then having my friend win it, and then through his generosity give that spot to me, I think that just really puts me in a very special spot,” Sembroski said. “Not only do I feel very lucky to be here, but I have a huge responsibility to pay that forward and show that generosity toward others.”', 'The four crew members have spent much of the last six months training with SpaceX to prepare for the mission. Reed noted that the Inspiration4 members studied over 90 training guides, took a multitude of lessons to learn how to fly the spacecraft, and did numerous simulation flights — including 12- and 30-hour simulations.', 'Isaacman also said the crew has “been tearing up the skies in some fighter jets” during training and prep, “which I put at relatively higher risk than this mission, so that we’re nice and comfortable as we get strapped into Falcon.”', 'Proctor praised SpaceX’s training process.', '“Since the announcement, when we were here [at Kennedy Space Center] last, every day has been the best day of my life and it’s only getting better,” Proctor said.', 'The primary goal of Inspiration4 is to raise funds and awareness for St. Jude. The Inspiration4 team aims to raise $200 million for the research hospital. Just over $30 million has been donated to date, with another $100 million coming from Isaacman.', 'SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule will fly to an orbital altitude of about 575 kilometers, where the Inspiration4 crew will float for about three days before reentering the atmosphere and splashing down on either the Gulf Coast or the Atlantic Coast of Florida.', 'Four hours before liftoff, the astronauts will suit up. About a half an hour later, they will walk out to their Tesla Model X rides, which will drive from the NASA astronaut quarters to the launchpad.', 'With 2½ hours to go, the astronauts will strap into their seats in Crew Dragon and begin checking that all systems are good to go. Then, with just under two hours until launch, the hatch to the spacecraft will be closed. ', 'SpaceX will begin loading the rocket with fuel 35 minutes before launch, which will initiate a final series of processes and checks.', 'A few minutes after liftoff, the Falcon 9′s booster stage will return and attempt to land on the company’s barge stationed in the Atlantic.', 'If anything were to go wrong in the last half hour before the launch or during the launch, Crew Dragon will abort and fire its emergency escape system. The company performed a full test of that system in January 2020 with no one inside the spacecraft. That test saw SpaceX trigger the system during the most intense part of the launch to show that it could be done at any time.', 'While NASA’s role in the mission is minimal compared with astronaut launches to the International Space Station, the agency is still involved. NASA is supporting Inspiration4 on a fully reimbursable basis under agreements with SpaceX, with the services in total worth about $1 million.', '“We are providing some services and some equipment, that just make more sense for NASA to provide,” McAlister said.', 'Reed thanked NASA for its partnership with SpaceX, as the agency was heavily involved in the development of the company’s Crew Dragon capsule.', 'SpaceX developed its Crew Dragon spacecraft and fine-tuned its Falcon 9 rocket under NASA’s Commercial Crew program, which provided the company with $3.1 billion to develop the system and launch six operational missions. Commercial Crew is a competitive program, as NASA also awarded Boeing with $4.8 billion in contracts to develop its Starliner spacecraft — but that competing capsule remains in development due to an uncrewed flight test that experienced significant challenges nearly two years ago.', 'Crew Dragon is the SpaceX capsule that will transport the passengers, with this specific spacecraft being dubbed “Resilience” by prior NASA astronauts. It is an evolved version of the company’s Cargo Dragon spacecraft, which has launched to the space station more than 20 times. Just as Cargo Dragon was the first privately developed spacecraft to bring supplies to the ISS, so Crew Dragon is the first privately developed spacecraft to transport people. ', 'NASA is now benefiting from its investment in Crew Dragon, which the agency certified for operational use last November.', '“This is the culmination of what we envisioned for the Commercial Crew Program 10 years ago,” McAlister said. “It’s actually in the original charter for the program, that the objective of what we were trying to accomplish was to achieve a system capable of crew transportation to the International Space Station, but also to enable a commercial capability for other customers.”', '“The program wouldn’t be fully successful, unless we had these kinds of missions [like Inspiration4],” McAlister said.', 'Crew Dragon with its trunk stands just under 27 feet tall and 13 feet around. The spacecraft includes its own system of small rocket engines for directional control in space and a launch abort system in the event of an emergency. Its trunk is the large lower half that’s covered in solar panels, which can carry cargo.', 'The spacecraft is designed to carry as many as seven people. Its control system is focused on touch screens, although NASA notes that Crew Dragon has a “robust fault tolerance built into the system.” With the astronauts wearing custom SpaceX spacesuits, the touch screens work whether or not the astronauts are wearing gloves. The spacesuits are largely designed to protect the astronauts in the event that the spacecraft loses pressurization, with life support and power systems connected through a point on the spacesuit’s leg.', 'SpaceX made one major change to Resilience, which was to add a “cupola” window in place of the spacecraft’s docking adapter in the nose cone.', 'Reed noted that SpaceX’s manifest of Crew Dragon missions “is getting busier by the minute,” with a growing backlog of private trips planned. He said SpaceX is “gearing up to be able to fly” three to six times a year.', 'Musk’s company has announced several private missions already, including a deal with Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa to fly on the company’s Starship rocket on a trip around the moon in 2023. SpaceX also has space tourism deals with Axiom Space, which aims to fly four people to the International Space Station on a 10-day trip early next year, and Space Adventures, which plans to fly four tourists on a five-day “free-flyer” trip to orbit by 2022.', 'SpaceX’s Falcon 9 is the workhorse of the company’s growing fleet of rockets. It stands at nearly 230 feet tall and is capable of launching as much as 25 tons to low Earth orbit. ', 'A few days before the Inspiration4 launch, SpaceX performed a static fire test of the full Falcon 9 rocket on the launch pad.', 'Crew Dragon sits in place of the rocket’s nose cone at the top. After launching the spacecraft on its way, the large lower portion of Falcon 9, known as the “booster,” will reenter the Earth’s atmosphere and attempt to land on the company’s drone ship in the ocean. SpaceX has landed its Falcon 9 rocket boosters 84 times.']"

The two Asian firms combined control more than 70% of the semiconductor manufacturing market.', 'The U.S., which was once a leader, lags behind in this space after monumental shifts in the business models in the semiconductor industry.', 'But a global semiconductor shortage and geopolitical tensions with China have bolstered Washington’s scrutiny of the supply chain, which is concentrated in the hands of a small number of players, and has created a drive to bring manufacturing back to American soil to regain leadership.', 'The U.S. has earmarked billions of dollars and is reportedly looking at alliances with other nations.', 'Semiconductors are critical to everything from cars to the smartphones we use. And they have also been thrust into the center of U.S.-China tensions.', '“One characteristic of US policy is that it has heavy emphasis on China. This has now become a national imperative to enhance self-sufficiency in semis production, accelerated by the recent chip shortages and the ‘tech war’ against China,” Bank of America said in a note published Wednesday.', 'The key to understanding the geopolitics of semiconductors, which countries dominate and why the U.S. is trying to boost its domestic industry, lies in coming to grips with the supply chain and business models.', 'Companies like Intel are integrated device manufacturers (IDMs), which design and manufacture their own chips.', 'Then there are the fabless semiconductor firms, which design chips but outsource manufacturing to so-called foundries. The two biggest foundries are TSMC in Taiwan and Samsung Electronics in South Korea.', 'Over the last 15 years or so, companies began shifting to this fabless model. TSMC and Samsung took advantage as they began to invest heavily in leading-edge manufacturing technology. Now if a company like Apple wants to get the latest chip for their iPhone produced, they have to turn to TSMC to do it.', 'TSMC has 55% foundry market share and Samsung has 18%, according to data from Trendforce. Taiwan and South Korea collectively have 81% of the global market in foundries, highlighting the dominance and reliance on these two countries as well as on TSMC and Samsung.', '“In 2001, 30 companies manufactured at the leading edge however as semi manufacturing grew in cost and difficulty, this number has fallen to just 3 firms” — TSMC, Intel and Samsung, according to a note from Bank of America published in December.', 'However, Intel’s manufacturing process is still behind that of TSMC and Samsung.', '“Taiwan and South Korea have become leaders in wafer fabrication which requires massive capital investment; and part of their success over the last 20 years is due to supportive government policies and access to skilled labour forces,” Neil Campling, head of technology, media and telecoms research at Mirabaud Securities, told CNBC by email.', 'While TSMC and Samsung are the dominant manufacturers of semiconductors, they still rely heavily on equipment and machinery from the U.S., Europe and Japan.', 'The companies that make these tools required by foundries are known as semiconductor capital equipment vendors or “semicap” for short.', 'The top five semicap equipment vendors make up nearly 70% of the market, according to Bank of America, citing Gartner data. Three of the five are U.S. companies, one is European and one is Japanese.', 'Netherlands-based ASML is the only company in the world that can make so-called extreme ultraviolet (EUV), which is required to make the most advanced chips such as those manufactured by TSMC and Samsung.', 'So, the U.S. is not necessarily falling behind in the semiconductor industry as a whole. Some of its firms are integral to the supply chain. But one area it has lagged in is manufacturing.', 'Under President Joe Biden, the U.S. is looking to regain leadership in manufacturing and secure supply chains.', 'In February, Biden signed an executive order which involves a review of the semiconductor supply chain to identify risks. As part of a $2 trillion economic stimulus package, $50 billion was earmarked for semiconductor manufacturing and research. A bill known as the CHIPS for America Act is also working its way through the legislative process and aims to provide incentives to enable advanced research and development and secure the supply chain.', 'Meanwhile, U.S. firm Intel last month announced plans to spend $20 billion to build two new chip factories and said it will act as a foundry. This could offer a domestic alternative to the likes of TSMC and Samsung.', 'Part of that scrutiny on the supply chain has been prompted by a global chip shortage that’s hit the automotive industry. The coronavirus pandemic accelerated demand for personal electronics like laptops and games consoles just as industrials and automakers wound down production. But a rebound in production plus heightened demand for chips in various sectors has triggered a shortage.', 'The concentration of production in the hands of TSMC and Samsung has worsened the problem.', 'The semiconductor supply shortage “has probably made the U.S. administration realise they aren’t in control of their own destiny,” according to Mirabaud Securities’ Campling.', 'But there are also geopolitical factors at play, informing U.S. policy.', '“Over the longer-term, the Biden administration wants to continue to encourage both foreign and U.S. semiconductor manufacturers to expand capacity in the U.S., to reduce dependence on manufacturing in geopolitically sensitive areas such as Taiwan, and create high paying engineering jobs in the U.S.,” Paul Triolo, head of the geo-technology practice at Eurasia Group, told CNBC by email.', 'Part of the U.S. policy in the semiconductor space involves forming alliances. Earlier this month, the Nikkei reported that the U.S. and Japan will cooperate on supply chains for critical components like semiconductors. The two sides will aim for a system where production is not concentrated on specific regions like Taiwan, the Nikkei said.', '“The U.S. is trying to cut China out of the equation,” Abishur Prakash, a geopolitical specialist at the Center for Innovating the Future, a Toronto-based consulting firm, told CNBC via email.', '“It is trying to redesign how the world’s chip industry works in the face of a rising China. This is not necessarily about self-sufficiency, although Washington would welcome this. Instead, it is about building up critical sectors — from AI to chips — that are insulated from geopolitics. And, because several nations share U.S. concerns about China, the U.S. is taking a chunk of the world with it.”', 'China meanwhile is trying to push self-sufficiency amid U.S. moves to cut it off from key supplies. Over the past few years, China has tried to boost its semiconductor industry through huge investments and incentives like tax breaks.', 'But China remains well behind everywhere else and that goes back to the supply chain. SMIC is China’s largest foundry, a competitor to the likes of TSMC and Samsung. But SMIC’s technology is several years behind that of its Taiwan and South Korean rivals.', 'And even if it wanted to advance, it’s extremely difficult due to U.S. sanctions and actions. Washington put SMIC on a blacklist known as the Entity List last year. That restricts American companies from exporting certain technology to SMIC, holding back the chipmaker due to the key role U.S. firms play in the semiconductor supply chain. Roughly 80% or more of SMIC equipment comes from U.S. vendors, according to Bank of America.', 'Last year, Reuters reported that the U.S. pressured the Netherlands government to stop the sale of an ASML machine to SMIC. The Dutch firm is the only company that makes the so-called extreme ultraviolet (EUV) machine that is needed to make the most cutting-edge chips. That machine has still not been shipped to China.', '“If China wants to manufacture leading edge chips, it is virtually impossible without equipment from the US or allies,” Bank of America said in its December note.', '“We remain skeptical about a meaningful progress in China’s progress due to US restrictions as it is materially behind in IP (intellectual property) and has limited access to IP given the US restrictions,” Bank of America said in a separate note last week.', '“Our team expects a delay of around 5+ years before it makes a more significant progress.”']"

The new strain of virus, called COVID-19, has killed more than 1,300 people, mostly in China, and infected over 64,000 people worldwide.', 'India reported three confirmed cases in the state of Kerala, out of more than 1,700 people tested around the country as of Thursday, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research. That included 654 people evacuated from Wuhan, all of whom had tested negative.', '“We started taking action on this in the middle of January, at least two weeks before the World Health Organization declared it as an emergency of international concern,” Vardhan told CNBC’s “Street Signs.”', 'Those measures include thermal screening for passengers coming from mainland China, Thailand, Singapore, Japan, and South Korea at airports and seaports, taking down their detailed history and then sharing that information with state-level and district-level surveillance officers to keep tabs on them through an integrated disease surveillance program, the health minister explained. More than 2,000 flights have been screened, he said.', '“We’ve got very good coordination with all our state governments. The whole issue is being monitored at the highest level in the country and also with the state governments,” Vardhan said. ', 'He said some 15,000 people have been “kept under watch as a matter of abundant precaution,” and those showing early symptoms were being kept in isolation at hospitals.', 'India also set up 15 laboratories to test for the virus, and Vardhan said the country has the potential to build up to 50 labs if the need arises. New Delhi has also issued travel advisories, telling people to refrain from traveling to China. The minister also said existing visas — including already issued electronic visas — for foreign nationals traveling to India from China are no longer valid and that screenings were also being conducted at the border.', '“Every concerned ministry is actively involved in ensuring that we plug every possible loophole, which can allow the entry of the virus in a big way in the country,” Vardhan said. “We are sure that (if) we could handle Ebola in 2014, (if) we could handle other diseases, we can handle this coronavirus quite well.”', 'Local airlines, including national carrier Air India, have also temporarily canceled flights to China.', 'Two Indian nationals on board a cruise ship in Japan also contracted the pneumonia-like virus, the Indian embassy in Tokyo confirmed on Wednesday. Both of them worked as crew members aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship that is currently quarantined off the coast of Yokohama and were receiving treatment in Japanese hospitals along with other infected individuals.', 'Six passengers and 132 crew members aboard the ship were Indian nationals and the embassy said it was working with local authorities over potentially early disembarkation for those who tested negative for the virus. Indian media reported some crew members had posted a video on social media requesting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government to bring them back.', 'Vardhan said that as soon as the quarantine period is over next week, India will work with Japan to make “adequate arrangements” to bring those people back to the country.', 'The cruise ship, operated by Carnival’s Princess Cruises and carrying more than 3,700 passengers and crew, has been quarantined in Japan since early February after a previous guest tested positive for the disease six days after disembarking.', 'While the economic impact in China and others, at least for the current quarter, is expected to be significant, economists have said that India would be less affected.', 'ANZ economists said in a recent note that’s likely due to the relatively small percentage of Chinese tourist arrivals to the country as well as a small share of Indian exports that go to China.', '“However, India’s imports from China are close to 14% and delays in shipments can have a bearing on economic activity in the former,” the economists said.']"
51,Canada’s PM Trudeau is facing a national energy crisis that’s at the tipping point,2019-03-12T12:30:17+0000,"['Far north of Texas, another great North American oil reserve sits, waiting — some say — to be further exploited. The province of Alberta is Canada’s main oil producer: 97 percent of the country’s proven reserves — 166.3 billion barrels — can be found in its oil sands. The reserve, buried beneath a layer of muskeg and forest in the northeastern part of the province, holds a reservoir of heavy crude oil known as bitumen, mixed with sand, clay and water. That oil is recovered by either mining or drilling: Both methods are more expensive than the means used to recover conventional oil reserves.', 'The Alberta oil sands already produce 3.6 million barrels of oil per day, and plans are to increase that to 3.9 million by 2027, but the province is facing a problem of oversupply. The infrastructure is in place to produce the oil, but the oil sands only have access to the North American market via crude-by-rail. The price differential between the unrefined bitumen produced in Canada and what American refineries can get for the synthetic crude they make out of it isn’t favorable to the Canadian market.', 'The bottom line: “Low oil prices have put the Alberta economy in crisis,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told the Chamber of Commerce in November.', 'Difficulties attracting investment and the price gap, which reached a record low late last year, are stymying efforts to ramp up production and boost exports beyond North America to lucrative markets in Asia.', 'A second oil pipeline that would run through neighboring British Columbia to the west coast could solve that problem and get the oil revenue-dependent province back on track. That’s what the convoy that arrived in the Canadian capital two weeks ago drove 2,000 miles to demand from the federal government.', 'The United We Roll truckers’ convoy numbered around 170 vehicles when it left Red Deer, Alberta. The motley band of semis, pickup trucks and cars driven by Alberta oil workers and supporters they picked up along the way arrived in Ottawa a few days later and staged several peaceful protests before departing.', '“Alberta’s hurting. We’re hurting for jobs, and it shows,” convoy member Mike Jepson told the CBC. Alberta’s economy is heavily dependent on oil, and a spike or drop in the price of oil results in thousands of job losses, both in the oil sector and elsewhere. As of January 2019, unemployment in the province sits at 6.8 percent. The province’s leadership, under Premier Rachel Notley, has been criticized for failing to prioritize diversifying the economy to provide some protection from volatile oil prices.', 'The convoy members think that building the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion (TMX) is key to Canada’s future economic competitiveness. Notley and Trudeau, her federal counterpart, have both said the same. But others say that making large capital investments in oil production is shortsighted. “It’s sad for anyone looking at Alberta to see how long it’s not been diversifying,” said McGill University economist Chris Barrington-Leigh.', 'One thing is certain: The province can’t continue as it is now.', 'The TMX would follow the path of the existing Trans Mountain Pipeline, increasing throughput from 300 barrels per day to 890,000. It would cross British Columbia and travel almost 700 miles to terminate at a shipping site in Vancouver, as CNBC reported in June 2018. At that time, the federal government purchased the project at a cost of $4.5 billion CAD from Kinder Morgan Canada in June 2018. The costs of building the TMX are estimated to be $7.4 billion CAD, money that Ottawa is seeking from private backers. No backers for the project have yet emerged.', 'Kinder Morgan backed out of the pipeline venture because it was too risky. Vocal protests in British Columbia and a series of court challenges have delayed and complicated the project.', 'The protests surround the possible environmental impacts of the pipeline — everything from oil spills to the impact of increased shipping on the resident killer whales — to questions over indigenous sovereignty.', '“Most land in British Columbia is unceded,” said Simon Fraser University marine ecologist Anne Salomon. That means British Columbia’s indigenous peoples, who didn’t sign historical treaties, “have constitutionally protected rights to engage in decisions about their territories and resources,” she said. The courts supported those rights in a 2018 decision that represented another setback for the TMX project.', 'The federal government remains committed to the pipeline. A new round of First Nations consultations is currently playing out, while the National Energy Board returned an environmentally-minded “Reconsideration Report” on Feb. 22 that supported the pipeline.', '“I think there’s lots of both political capital and actual capital at stake here,” said Jackie Forrest of the ARC Energy Research Institute, “and a lot of incentive for them to see the project through.”', 'The pipeline saga is connected to a hard turn to the right in mainstream Canadian politics. The United We Roll protests framed themselves as being under the same banner as France’s Yellow Vest movement, although protesting a national carbon tax rather than diesel pricing.', 'But over the course of their eastward trip, it became clear that the intent of the movement’s supporters was more diffuse. Politically extreme viewpoints, including racist and anti-immigration messaging, became linked with the convoy.', '“This anticarbon tax, anti-immigration, openly racist right wing movement is showing the world that Canada is not immune to this tide of far right politics,” said University of Saskatchewan political scientist Charles Smith. United We Roll shows that this far right movement is materially tied to Canada’s oil sector, he said.', 'In the short term a pipeline could attract investment capital to the oil sands, but it wouldn’t necessarily represent a change in oil sands output right away. Forrest said the growth outlook would likely be similar to what’s currently expected over the next four to five years, because of existing investments. Widely cited estimates from the Conference Board of Canada, a think tank, place the value of the pipeline at $18.5 billion in revenue for provincial and federal governments over the 20-year period.', 'But the pipeline may prove to be a bad investment, say experts. “These are damned expensive pieces of capital to put into play,” said University of Wyoming oil economist Charles Mason.', 'Right now Canada is the world’s fifth-largest crude oil producer. Ninety-nine percent of its crude oil exports go to the United States. The existing market for Canadian crude oil is likely to change because of the U.S. energy renaissance, he said. Currently, American refineries are configured to optimally handle heavier crude, such as that which comes from Canada and Venezuela.', 'But in-country oil production in North Dakota and the Permian Basin is likely to change the focus of investment toward processing for the “light, tight” crude oil that’s produced in-country via hydraulic fracturing. This leads him to think demand for heavy crude from Canada and Venezuela will shrink over the next 20 years.', 'That’s an argument for Canada developing alternative markets in places like Asia. But Mason also questions if predictions for those markets are overly optimistic.', 'Other future costs are more difficult to quantify, but easier — at this late date — to predict. “If you take into account the social costs of releasing fossil fuels, there’s no way it’s economical [to build the Trans Mountain pipeline],” said McGill University’s economist Barrington-Leigh.', 'Those costs could come home to roost in the form of a much feared oil spill on the coast. Tanker traffic will more than double because of increased throughput. There still isn’t full understanding of the potential impacts of an oil spill, said Salomon, and proponents of the TMX, including Forrest, say that everything possible will be done to mitigate that possibility.', 'But an oil spill isn’t the only threat to coastal ecosystems, which the City of Vancouver directly links to more than 300,000 jobs in every field from tourism to fishing. The financial impact of burning fossil fuels themselves, though “often not accounted for in tradeoff analyses,” needs to be taken into consideration on an infrastructure project such as this one, Salomon said.', 'Warming and acidifying oceans — consequences of climate change, which is directly linked to burning fossil fuels — impact Canada’s fisheries, she said. For some species fished in Canada, like the Pacific herring and the Atlantic cod, impact estimates are as high as 30 percent to 60 percent stock loss in the next 50 years.', 'The Stockholm Environment Institute estimates expanding Canadian oil sands production “could increase global emissions by 50 million to 150 million tons of CO2 annually by 2030.” Currently, oil sands production accounts for about one quarter of the country’s greenhouse-gas emissions each year.', '2030 is the same year by which the 2018 International Panel on Climate Change report warns warming could exceed the crucial 1.5 degree Celsius threshold, leading to devastating environmental and human consequences. If a pipeline is built, which will ramp up production over the longer term, it will be next to impossible for Canada to meet its Paris Climate Agreement commitments and help keep warming below this level, Barrington-Leigh said.', 'Expanding oil sands production in Canada could also drive down global oil prices in the long term, the institute said. Current predictions of a global slowdown in demand could lead to a global oversupply crisis. It’s already true that demand trends in developed nations are steady or downward, Forrest said: Developing nation markets are where demand is on the rise.', 'Barrington-Leigh sees another path forward. Years of an oil boom have left Alberta in a great position to innovate, he said. Oil proponents like Forrest say that innovation could be channeled into making the oil sands greener — and the financial boost afforded by a pipeline and access to the Asian markets could fund that innovation. But more focus on oil is just the Dutch disease, Barrington-Leigh said.', 'The problem for the private sector remains uncertain. With a pipeline project surrounded by a complicated web of intergovernmental conflict and no clear federal leadership on a way forward that creates jobs for Albertans while also helping to diversify the province’s economy, Barrington-Leigh said there’s no way to attract investment.', 'For now, political tensions over this issue keep rising during Alberta’s provincial election and Canada’s federal election year.']"

The Covid-19 pandemic hurt the quarterly earnings overall, but Apple CEO Tim Cook indicated that more recent sales numbers provide reason for optimism, and at least one Apple business expects the coronavirus to accelerate rather than hinder its near-term success. ', 'It’s an Apple business most people don’t know much about, if they know it at all: Claris, which sells the low-code application development software called FileMaker. ', '“There is a massive opportunity for low code to help in the Covid-19 situation,” said Claris CEO Brad Freitag, who took the reins at the company last year and rebranded what had long been known as FileMaker under the Claris name.', 'That’s particularly true in some of the sectors with the most immediate need to quickly develop new and unexpected solutions as a result of the pandemic, including government, health care, education and nonprofits.', '“Software is not eating the world now,” says Freitag, referencing a famous 2011 quote from venture capital Marc Andreessen. “It is helping to heal the world, and the low-code category awareness for nonprofits, government, health care and education is up, and it can have an immediate impact, a profound impact.”', 'Claris has worked with health-care providers to develop apps in as short as one day, including one for a hospital in Europe that became critical to make real-time medical decisions for Covid-19 patients. ', '“They had a decision tree map drawn on paper for triage of Covid patients,” Freitag explained. “Walking into some central room in ICU and going through a decision tree to determine next steps ... but the challenge with that sheet of paper in treatment is changing in real time.”', '', 'A mobile app that took a day to build could outline a decision tree and, as new information surfaced, create a dynamic way to modify the decision tree. ', '“Government, health care and education jump out for a variety of reasons,” Freitag said. “Teachers working on distance-learning efforts which could not be supported economically before but is now practical; governments struggling to get stimulus checks out using antiquated systems; and just everyone working from home, knowledge workers able to work remotely and be productive but need new systems for collaboration.”', 'He said remote work is one change that will become permanent and will require many more software solutions never thought about before by organizations. ', '“You never wish for a crisis to support your sector, but I think it will grow even more than forecast, partly because we will head into a downturn and that will put more cost pressure on organizations solving complex digital problems,” the Claris CEO said. “In a strong market, they could solve it with a bigger budget and industrial-strength solutions, but we are going to see a more pragmatic approach.”', 'There are concerns that a prolonged economic slump will lead to a greater focus from IT managers on cost-cutting in software, which has grown to represent 50% of the enterprise since the financial crisis, when it was IT hardware that saw the steep cuts.', '“Right now we’re substantially in investment mode for R&D talent and think there will be significant hiring opportunities in the post-pandemic economy,” Freitag said.', '“In a recession, people have to get creative on value justification. We’ll be happy to go up against big vendors in terms of business case justification,” said the Claris CEO, who worked at Oracle for more than a decade. ', 'Freitag is not alone in seeing a major opportunity now.', 'John Rymer, a cloud analyst at Forrester Research who coined the term low code, tells CNBC, “We think this will have a profound impact too on the move to low code.” ', 'But Rymer stressed that the case is more logical than proven at this point. “What we are seeing is companies that are already in the game, already working with a low code vendor, we’re seeing them expand utilization, but we have not seen as many new companies coming into the market,” he said.', '“I think we are being reminded once again that there are lots of people who are not aware of low code or sold on it, or in the market for it yet. But I am waiting for it, waiting for the pain to become so great that new customers start to recognize it and come in,” Rymer said.', 'Rymer noted a report he recently reviewed about a hospital taking weeks to build a visitor tracking app during the Covid-19 outbreak, which could be developed in low code in a day, as a logical use case for an organization that should soon see the logic of the low code approach. “We see the potential for a big moment,” Rymer said. “In health care, government and education there are unending new use cases,” he added.', 'Claris says it has seen a spike in inbound inquiries amid the crisis, including both ongoing tech support and new customers, with big spikes in health care, education and the logistics sector.  “Logistics was new to me, but it makes sense ... trucking, shipping parcels. It makes perfect sense given how much happens at small and mid-sized companies and not just Amazon,” Freitag said.', 'Starting from March 1, before Covid-19 was a major issue across the U.S., through the peak period of the crisis, the spike has been as high as 50%, he said. ', '“We’ve been doing this for several decades. This is our heritage, extracting away complexity,” Freitag said.', 'The Claris CEO cited a reason for increased interest in low code that also has been cited by Alphabet’s Google Cloud and Microsoft, which are placing greater focus on low-code solutions for enterprise clients to capitalize on the need among companies for less complex coding solutions that can lead to faster project completion across more business functions.', 'That reason is the scarcity of comp sci grads to staff roles. Microsoft expects 500 million new apps to be built in the next half decade, which is more than all the apps built in the last 40 years. “If that’s true, 450 million have to be built with a low-code tool,” Charles Lamanna, corporate vice president of the citizen applications platform at Microsoft, recently told CNBC. “There are not enough humans to code fast enough to build that many.”', '“Recruiting was hyper-competitive before, and that will favor low code, more broad emphasis on reskilling and upskilling talent that want to pick up technical skills. Prosperity will be created by individuals who get these low-code skills,” Freitag said.', 'Claris current works with Amazon Web Services, but as the competition between the big cloud platforms becomes more intense, Claris will probably expand with Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, Freitag said, even though the Apple subsidiary has not partnered with them previously. Like many low-code companies, “we’re agnostic by philosophy,” Freitag said.', 'Meeting a variety of customer preferences mean it makes sense for Claris tools to become available across more platforms. Some customers may prefer Google Cloud because of existing use of G Suite tools, while others may prefer to not use Google due to their views on privacy policy. Customers may also be more likely to move from one cloud provider to another in a more competitive market based on price and a period of contract renegotiations, and requests for better terms could be forced by an economic downturn.', 'Rymer said it makes sense for Claris to move to a multi-cloud approach to evolve from its history, too, which has focused more on what is referred to as on-premise service. “They have tons of customers running ‘on prem,’ but the future is in the cloud, and that is where new demand is,” said the Forrester cloud analyst.', '“On-prem software will exist for long term,” Freitag said, but he added, “the cloud is about affordability and rapid up-time and scale.”', 'Apple’s enterprise business has focused more on selling computers than software. Apple does not disclose FileMaker sales, but Claris is profitable — and has been for more 20 years, Freitag told CNBC at the time of a rebranding under the Claris name last summer.', '“For any company coming under cost pressure, and with IT a cost center, they will know that they can’t give a marketer a Java stack, but they can give them reasonable governance about a low-code stack and that gives them more job security too,” Freitag said, explaining that low code provides staff outside of core IT a way to upskill themselves. ', 'Unlike parent company Apple, which is seeing big growth from its services business and newer areas like subscriptions to TV and music streaming, Claris has no goal to go directly to consumers. The low code company has over 50,000 business customers and millions of FileMaker downloads, with a sweet spot among small to medium-sized businesses with between 100 to 1,000 employees across many industries and business units.

53,UPS agrees to buy electric vertical aircraft to speed up package delivery in small markets,2021-04-07T12:00:01+0000,"['United Parcel Service is taking package delivery to new heights, literally, with the purchase of 10 electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft from Beta Technologies.', 'In an announcement Wednesday, Atlanta-based UPS said it will test the eVTOLs for use in its Express Air delivery network, focusing on small and medium markets. The company will operate the eVTOLs under its Flight Forward division, which is also exploring drone delivery.', 'The new type of aircraft, which looks like a cross between a plane and a helicopter, “unlocks new business models that don’t exist today,” Bala Ganesh, vice president of the UPS Advanced Technology Group, told CNBC. “For example, you can see a future where it’s carrying, let’s say 1,000 pounds, 1,500 pounds to rural hospitals,” and landing on a helipad instead of an airport.', 'Vermont-based Beta Technologies will design and build the eVTOLs, which are set to be delivered to UPS in 2024, pending certification from the Federal Aviation Administration. Beta will also provide landing pads and rechargeable batteries. UPS holds an option to purchase up to 150 more eVTOLs. The price of the transaction was not disclosed. The eVTOLs can fly up to 250 miles at 170 mph on a single charge.', '“We’ve also thought about for some urgent moments, like for example bypass New York traffic, and then move it into directly to our 43rd Street building so that we can get around congestion,” Ganesh said. “It’s not going be a fit for all the packages but for certain use cases: Willingness to pay, and urgency, we could potentially think about going into those areas.”', 'The eVTOLs would be used similarly to small fixed-wing aircraft that have a capacity of 500 to 3,000 pounds. UPS said it initially plans to use them in smaller markets and create a series of short routes or one long route to meet customer needs. The eVTOLs will have an operation advantage over small planes, according to Ganesh, because they’re designed to accommodate shipping containers, which allow for faster movement of packages in many cases.', '“The smaller aircraft typically are not containerized. They don’t have any kind of container, so it’s loading a package into these aircraft, then its lands, and then has to be unloaded loaded into a truck or another vehicle and then driven to another location, resorted again, reloaded into the package car that delivers it, ” Ganesh said.', 'Beta Technologies founder Kyle Clark said his team has worked with UPS to help transform how the company handles moving packages.', '“We’re combining simple, elegant design and advanced technology to create a reliable aircraft with zero operational emissions that will revolutionize how cargo moves,” Clark said in a statement. “By utilizing vertical takeoffs and landings, we can turn relatively small spaces at existing UPS facilities into a micro air feeder network without the noise or operating emissions of traditional aircraft.”', 'Sustainability has become increasingly important since Carol Tome became CEO of UPS last June. In its 2020 annual report, UPS said its goal is to reduce greenhouse gases from its ground business by 12% and source 25% of its electric needs from renewable sources by 2025.', 'UPS announced in January 2020 a commitment to purchase up to 10,000 electric vehicles from Arrival Group, which is headquartered in London and Charlotte, North Carolina. The eVTOL batteries will also be compatible with those vehicles. Even when the batteries’ first life cycle in the aircraft ends, they can still be used in the EVs.', '“It just creates easier operating models, which just makes things easier to deploy and manage as we move forward,” said Ganesh, “creating newer ways of handling which gives us more flexibility and optimally, reduces our costs.”']"

Some, made with phosphonates, even contribute to algal blooms. “It was shocking to learn these chemicals are not the cleanest, because they end up in our water supply. We wanted to make those safer and cheaper at the same time,” he said.', 'Solugen introduced its BioChelate water treatment made from simple sugar — a dark brown liquid that Hunt keeps in a vial on his desk — in 2020. It now sells BioChelate to a network of water treatment service providers who haul and pump it into to their customers’ pipes and water systems, while monitoring their water quality to keep it clean.', '“If you use our chemistry, you protect the inner linings of water infrastructure,” Hunt said. “This keeps your pipes from rusting and corroding, from getting blocked up with lime, or letting biofilms like legionella live in the water. All of this prevents the pipes from having bursts and catastrophic leaks.

They essentially look the same as their predecessors.', 'What’s new this time is the chip that runs them. Now they’re powered by Apple’s M1 chip instead of Intel processors. Tuesday’s announcement marks the end of a 15-year run where Intel processors powered Apple’s laptops and desktops, and a big shift for the semiconductor industry.', 'Apple is the fourth-largest PC maker measured by shipments, according to a Gartner estimate, so its plan to use its own chips in its entire lineup of laptops and desktops, first announced in June, is a blow for Intel.', '“We believe Intel-powered PCs—like those based on 11th Gen Intel Core mobile processors—provide global customers the best experience in the areas they value most, as well as the most open platform for developers,” Intel said in a statement.', 'Apple’s chips are based on ARM technology, as opposed to the x86 architecture that Intel’s chips use. ARM was originally designed for mobile devices, and chips built with ARM designs are consistently more efficient, leading to longer battery life. On a laptop, that could mean several extra hours away from the plug.', 'But that’s only one reason why Apple is switching out the brains of its laptops. Here’s a rundown of why Apple made the move:', 'Apple’s strategy of owning core technologies. Apple CEO Tim Cook has frequently said that the company has a “long-term strategy of owning and controlling the primary technologies behind the products we make.”', 'For a computer hardware company, there are few technologies less essential than the silicon processors that the machines run on.', 'Apple has invested heavily in its silicon department, including major purchases, starting with a $278 million purchase of P. A. Semi in 2008, which started the department, and most recently, $1 billion for part of Intel’s modem business in 2019. It’s been building its own A-series chips for iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches since 2010. Now it’s essentially bringing the same technology to laptops and desktops, meaning that all Apple computers basically run on the same framework.', '“Apple Silicon is totally in keeping with the strategic goal of Apple to really control an entire stack,” CCS Insight research director Wayne Lam said. “Now in computing, they own everything from silicon to the software to how the user moves the mouse around, so it’s tremendously integrated.”', 'Controlling its own technologies helps Apple integrate its products more deeply. It also means that it runs its own schedule — chips take 3 years to develop, Apple senior vice president Johny Srouji said last year — and has more control over costs.', '“Apple thinks they can innovate faster than the standard business model of Intel or Qualcomm doing the development on chips and then they build on top of it,” Lam said.', 'Intel is falling behind in manufacturing. Apple proudly said on Tuesday that the M1 chip in the new Macs uses 5-nanometer transistors.', '“Five-nanometer is the leading edge of process technology right now and there are only a few products out at this point,” Gartner research director Jon Erensen said. Currently, Intel is shipping chips with 10-nanometer transistors.', 'In general, the more transistors a chipmaker can fit into the same space, the more efficient the chip is. Currently, Intel ships chips only with 10-nanometer transistors.', 'Intel famously controls its own factories, called “fabs,” around the world, compared to Apple, which contracts with companies in Asia to manufacture chips to its own specifications. But Apple’s chip manufacturing partner, TSMC, can make 5-nanometer chips while Intel can’t.', '“Intel’s had some challenges over the last couple of years on the manufacturing side. And I think those challenges have opened a window or opportunity for ARM-based designs for come in. Apple is one of the the best ARM-based processor designers out there,”  Erensen said.', 'Earlier this year, Intel CEO Bob Swan said that it was considering outsourcing its manufacturing, like what Apple does.', '“With the challenges that Intel has had moving to 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer while foundries like TSMC and Samsung have pushed more aggressively, it’s taken one of Intel’s key advantages and leveled the playing field a bit,” Erensen said.', 'More battery life, potentially better performance, and laptops that work like phones. Apple says that the M1 Macs are better products than the older models, mainly because Apple claims its chips enbable better performance and longer battery life than it could achieve using Intel’s chips.', 'It’s clear that the new Macs will have improved battery life. Apple’s previous chips have been used in smartphones and tablets, which have significantly smaller batteries.', 'During Apple’s launch event on Tuesday, the company emphasized how it mainly evaluates chips on performance per watt, not raw performance.', 'On the entry-level MacBook Air, Apple says that it can manage 15 hours of web browsing on one charge, nearly 30% more than the advertised 10 to 11 hour battery life of the previous Intel-based model.', 'The new Macs also work more like phones or tablets, Apple said, with features like the ability to wake up from sleep instantly. The new M1 Macs can even run iPhone apps, if the developer takes a few steps to make them available on Apple’s App Store.', 'However, analysts warn that Apple’s performance claims, like that it is faster than comparable PCs, will need to be tested once the computers hit shelves next week.', '“Performance of the new M1 chip is nearly impossible to gauge as the company didn’t provide any detailed substantiation around any of the performance claims made,” Moor Insights founder Patrick Moorhead said.', 'Apple did not stop selling Intel laptops on Tuesday, and its highest-end laptops are still Intel-based, suggesting that there are still performance advantages to some Intel chips.']"

The Swedish retailer joined the likes of Nike, Birkenstock and PopSockets, which decided selling on Amazon wasn’t worth the hassle, and opted to pull out instead.', 'The moves have sparked fears that Amazon will soon see more big brands flee the site. Even if brands end their relationship with Amazon, shoppers can still purchase their products on the site via third-party sellers. And unless companies can develop an e-commerce strategy to compete with Amazon’s customer-obsessed mindset, experts say ditching Amazon has the potential to backfire.', 'Amazon continues to dominate online shopping. It controls 38% of the e-commerce market in the U.S., far ahead of rivals like eBay and Walmart, which only claim single-digit percentages, according to eMarketer.', 'Brands that attempt to replicate the services they lost by ditching Amazon may find it impossible. Amazon’s logistics and shipping operations, site traffic and mountains of shopper data are hard to match, even if you’re a well-known brand like Ikea.', 'And yet, that hasn’t stopped Ikea from venturing out on its own. Ikea told CNBC in a statement that it’s moving away from Amazon as the company is “keen on exploring new areas” to reach consumers.', '“Ikea worked on a pilot project with Amazon in the U.S. for Smart Lighting in 2018. The project was a trial and after it ended, it did not go live,” the company said. “We will continue to dialogue with different partners to test new ways to meet our customers now and in the future, whenever and wherever they want.”', 'Several days after this article was published, an Ikea spokesperson shared a new statement with CNBC, noting that the company continues to work with Amazon on smart home projects: ', '“We are curious and keen on exploring new areas to get insights on how to reach and serve more of the many people,” the new statement said. “Ikea explored the possibilities to launch a pilot with Amazon in the U.S. but cancelled the project before the launch. Approximately 30 products were in the scope of the project and the plan was to run the pilot for a limited time. The project was cancelled as Ikea was not ready for [third-party] retail testing at that time. Amazon and IKEA are collaborating in the area of the smart home and will continue to work closely together on assuring compatibility within our product range.”', 'Among the strategies it has considered are developing its own marketplace that would function similar to Amazon’s, according to the Financial Times. Ikea declined to comment on its plans to launch an online platform.', 'Amazon’s marketplace is the company’s not-so-secret weapon that prevents it from relying on brands to fill the site with products. Even if a first-party vendor decides to leave the site, their product is probably still available on Amazon, by way of a third-party merchant, said James Thomson, a former Amazon manager and now partner at brand consultancy Buy Box Experts.', 'For example, a quick scan of Ikea products available on Amazon shows that there are often several third-party sellers for a single listing that offer the item at a similar price to the brand and with Prime shipping. For many Amazon shoppers, that’s likely a good enough reason not to look elsewhere.', '“To say the brand has won by walking away, they haven’t won at all,” Thomson said. “Amazon has a massive security blanket called the third-party marketplace.

PopSockets, which sells grips that attach to the back of cellphones, still has some products available on the site, the Amazon spokesperson said.', 'The marketplace was also the primary reason why Birkenstock left Amazon in 2016, followed by Nike last November. Birkenstock said at the time that Amazon had become overrun by counterfeits and unauthorized sellers, which it felt had the potential to “jeopardize” the brand. Nike initially agreed to sell on the site under the premise that Amazon would crack down on counterfeits and third-party distributors. When that didn’t happen, Nike decided to cut ties.', 'As a result of how the marketplace works, brands are no longer just Amazon’s selling partners. They’re often competing against third parties and even Amazon itself. Amazon has greatly expanded its private-label business, which includes products developed by Amazon or by third parties who exclusively sell the items on the site. It’s also widely believed that Amazon uses data from its marketplace to develop private-label brands.', 'Amazon’s aggressive private-label strategy was thrust front and center last year, when Allbirds called out Amazon for selling a nearly identical version of its $95 wool sneakers for half the price. While Allbirds never sold its shoes on Amazon, the move was viewed by the company as a clear attempt to “siphon off demand” from its product.', 'The Amazon spokesperson told CNBC its wool sneakers don’t infringe on Allbirds’ design. “This aesthetic isn’t limited to Allbirds, and similar products are also offered by several other brands,” the spokesperson said.', 'Justin Leigh, CEO of e-commerce advisory firm Ideoclick, said his company has worked with brands that have left Amazon. For some brands, the “frustration built to the point that they walked away without a strategy beyond just not doing business with [Amazon] anymore.”', 'Leigh said a brand like Ikea might find some success off of Amazon because there are “still things Amazon doesn’t do well and big, bulky items are one of them.” The site doesn’t lend itself particularly well to furniture shopping, since it’s hard to manage shipping, damages and returns on furniture, he added.', 'There are other retail areas that aren’t fulfilled by Amazon or the marketplace. Some luxury fashion companies, such as LVMH, which has brands like Louis Vuitton and Givenchy, don’t sell on the site. Amazon has realized it has to court high-fashion brands if it wants to feature those products on the platform, Thomson said, since there are few opportunities for third-party sellers to buy those items at a deep discount and resell them on the site.', 'Ultimately, if Amazon continues to clash with brands, more of them are likely to leave. But the exodus is also likely to be a slow drip rather than a flood. Bigger brands may take advantage of their consumer loyalty to move away from Amazon, but smaller businesses, as well as legacy brands that can’t compete with Amazon’s aggressive promotions and logistics network, are likely to remain for the time being.']"

The company has raised a total of about $45.5 million to date from investors including Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff.', 'The deal, announced Tuesday, expands on an existing partnership with Microsoft on Kano’s bright orange Windows-powered PC. It also sees Kano join the ranks of large IT players like Lenovo and Dell in obtaining original equipment manufacturer licensing from Microsoft.', 'That means Kano is now able to ship its PCs with Windows 10 Pro — a premium version of Microsoft’s operating system — to schools and has also formed a co-selling agreement with Microsoft.', 'Kano has received a tender from the Japanese government to sell 3 million of its devices in the country and is in talks to sell thousands of units in the United Arab Emirates. The firm’s PC retails at $299, cheaper than Microsoft’s Surface Go hybrid PC and on par with some of Google’s cheaper Chromebook computers.', 'It comes as demand for educational technology, or “edtech,” has surged amid the Covid-19 outbreak. Lockdowns across the world caused nationwide school closures in 190 countries at the peak of the pandemic in mid-April, impacting 90% of the world’s pupils.', 'Meanwhile, the global PC market has recently returned to growth after suffering its worst decline in sales since 2013. According to Gartner, worldwide PC shipments grew 2.8% in the second quarter, as demand for laptops and tablets increased and vendors recovered from coronavirus-related supply chain disruptions.', 'Kano started out in 2013 as a venture aimed at teaching kids how to build their own computers and code. It gained traction selling easy-to-build computer kits based on compact Raspberry Pi circuit boards that came with the open-source Linux operating system. ', 'While it hasn’t retired the Raspberry Pi kits altogether, CEO and co-founder Alex Klein told CNBC that the company has increased investment into the PC it built in partnership with Microsoft. ', 'Klein said the Linux-based computers created an “accessibility barrier” for some users but stressed his firm hasn’t forgotten the “punk rock spirit” it embraced in its early days of existence.', 'A big part of the deal, Klein said, is helping his company compete with Google in the multi-billion dollar educational computing market.', 'Google’s Chromebooks have swiftly become the top-selling computers in U.S. schools over the years. In 2018, they made up 60% of all laptops and tablets in K-12 classrooms, up from just 5% in 2012, according to data from consulting firm Futuresource. Microsoft accounted for 22% of the market in 2018, while Apple trailed behind on 18%.', '“We shouldn’t be putting Chromebooks in the hands of kids,” Klein said, referring to a warning from international non-profit Electronic Frontier Foundation that the devices enable spying on students. “They’re catching your data all the time.”', 'For its part, Google has said it’s committed to maintaining students’ privacy and doesn’t use their data for advertising purposes.', 'Speaking about Kano’s deeper ties with Microsoft, Klein said he was “inspired” by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s commitment to open-source technology. In recent years, the tech giant has bought the software development platform GitHub and built its Edge browser based on source code from Google’s open-source Chromium project.', 'As well as PCs, Kano also sells motion-sensing coding kits based on AT&T-owned Warners Bros’ “Harry Potter” franchise and Disney’s “Star Wars” series. Once assembled, the devices allow users to create code and interact with Kano’s software.', 'But Kano has yet to turn a profit. It racked up losses of £11 million in the 12 months to March 2018.

Instead, it will double down on manufacturing, and invest $20 billion in two new chip factories in Arizona.', '“Intel is back. The old Intel is now the new Intel,” Gelsinger said.', 'Investors had been hoping that Gelsinger, who started his career with over 30 years at Intel, could right the ship after years of challenges in which its most advanced chip development stalled and was passed by Asian rivals, like TSMC, which can currently manufacture smaller transistors and thus superior chips.', 'On Tuesday, Gelsinger was energetic when talking about esoteric semiconductor technologies, and a lot of his talk seemed to be aimed at getting Intel’s workforce fired up.', '“We’re bringing back the execution discipline of Intel. What I’ve called the Grove-ian culture that we do what we say that we’re doing to do,” Gelsinger said, referring to legendary CEO Andy Grove, who built Intel into a U.S. tech juggernaut during the 1980s and 90s. ', '“We have that confidence in our execution. That our teams are fired up. You know, if we said we’re going to do X, we’re going to do 1.1x every time we make a commitment,” Gelsinger said.', 'Investors loved it — the stock rose more than 6% in extended trading on Tuesday.', 'Gelsinger on Tuesday showed that he is wasting no time making big changes. The most significant shift in strategy is a new division called Intel Foundry Services that taps into one of the biggest trends in the semiconductor world.', 'Many top technology firms and chip makers have moved to a model where they design chips, but turn to Asian factories run by companies such as TSMC and Samsung to manufacture them.', 'Intel has only dabbled in manufacturing chips for other companies, instead preferring to design its own high-performance chips and manufacture them as well.', 'It’s going to keep manufacturing most of its high-end chips, but now, Intel will run those factories for other companies too — and they’re based in the U.S. and Europe, for customers like governments for whom that’s important.', '“I believe this is the first time Intel is actually, seriously doing what it needs to take to create a ‘real’ foundry,” said Patrick Moorhead, analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy.', 'The foundry strategy also highlights Intel’s position as a major American manufacturer, which many lawmakers have sought to protect with incentives as supply chain problems and chip shortages have revealed issues with having many of the fastest chips manufactured in places like Taiwan and Korea.', 'Intel’s announcement and its $20 billion investment in new factories on U.S. soil suggest that in a few years, companies that might have been forced to go to Asia to manufacture semiconductors could be able to get similar performance from chips fabricated in places like Arizona.', '“Today’s announcement by Intel is proof that our legislation investing in semiconductor manufacturing helps grow Arizona’s economy, creates good-paying jobs across our state, helps enhance our national security, and ensures our country continues to lead in innovation,” Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema said in a statement.', 'Gelsinger said that government incentives weren’t the only reason Intel is making this move.', '“This is the Intel strategy, period, full stop. It does not depend on a penny of government support, or state support, or any other investments to make it successful,” Gelsinger said. Intel said on Tuesday that it believed the foundry market could be worth $100 billion in 2025.', 'Intel suggested that there was a lot of demand for its foundry services, especially from big American technology companies. It said it’s received enthusiasm for its foundry services from companies including Amazon, Cisco, Google, IBM and Qualcomm. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella even appeared in a short video to endorse the plan.', 'Not on that list was Apple, which replaced Intel chips with its own chips in its latest line of laptops, spurring the most recent round of handwringing about Intel’s technical future. Intel is currently running advertisements comparing its chips to Apple’s.', 'But Gelsinger had so much swagger on Tuesday that he said he believes that Intel might be able to win that business back with its new foundry unit.', '“We’ll also pursue customers like Apple and say, ‘Boy, you know, is it possible to build and expand on your foundry capabilities as well?’” Gelsinger said.']"

David Vernon said a shift to electric should provide a long-term benefit.', '“Electric is going to allow you to save on the cost of fuel and significantly lower the cost of maintenance,” said Vernon.', 'Earlier this month, Hyundai and Kia Motors announced a $110 million investment in Arrival, and the company will develop electric vehicles designed for delivery for the automakers.', 'Arrival’s top rival is U.S.-based Rivian, which has partnered with Amazon and Ford. The e-commerce giant has invested $700 million in Rivian, which has plans to provide Amazon with more than 100,000 electric delivery vans in 2021. Ford invested $500 million in Rivian, and the companies will partner to build new electric battery vehicles.', 'Meanwhile, UPS said Wednesday it is testing self-driving minivans with Alphabet subsidiary Waymo in the Phoenix area over the next six months.', 'In February, an autonomous minivan will transport packages from a UPS Store to a UPS sorting facility. A Waymo engineer will ride in the autonomous vehicle to monitor operations at least initially. If the test is successful, UPS said, it could expand the test to more stores and vehicles.', '“UPS is exploring automated and autonomous technologies to enhance network operations,” said Scott Price, UPS chief strategy and transformation officer. “Getting packages to our sortation facility sooner and more frequently, while also creating an opportunity for later drop-offs for next-day service, can add enormous value for our customers.”', 'The test is trying to determine if autonomous delivery improves efficiency or customer service.', 'Rival FedEx is testing autonomous robots for delivery to homes and businesses. And UPS owns an undisclosed stake in self-driving truck startup TuSimple, which is also testing in Arizona.', 'In addition to these efforts, UPS is looking to add 7 million square feet of sorting space globally before the 2020 holiday season.', 'It will spend $1.4 billion in Pennsylvania to boost its capacity to sort and ship e-commerce packages in the Northeast through the creation of a super hub in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Automation upgrades will be made to three other facilities in the region to speed sorting and shipping of packages between Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, New York, Baltimore and Washington, D.C. All together the upgrades will help add more than 1,700 new jobs, UPS said.', 'Other facility expansions are also planned for this year.', 'As part of its three-year plan, announced in 2018, UPS is targeting $20 billion in capital expenditures.', 'FedEx has committed more than $17 billion to capex spending between 2018 and 2020, including an estimated $5.9 billion this fiscal year, according to its 2019 annual report. In 2018, the company also announced a nearly $3 billion investment to upgrade and modernize its two largest hubs, in Memphis and Indianapolis.', '“If you think about the Northeast and the amount of population there, it makes a lot of sense. It will reduce the time in transit, and the efficiency will improve margins,” said Vernon. He said automation can allow the company to be “more dynamic and responsive to changes in volume and changes in demand.”', 'UPS reports earnings on Thursday before the bell.', 'The company’s stock has a market value of $99 billion, and shares have risen nearly 15% over the past 12 months.

63,Cuba-bound Carnival pioneers historic voyage,2016-05-02T14:35:45+0000,"['  On Sunday, the 704-passenger Adonia cruise ship is expected to  sail from Miami, Florida, to Havana, Cuba. In doing so, the  vessel is sailing into history — becoming the first U.S.  leisure ship to voyage between the United States and Cuba in more  than 50 years. ', '  The ship pulled out of the Port of Miami around 4pm ET,  accompanied by a large contingent of police in the water and the  Coast Guard in the air. ', '  The Adonia is part of Carnival’s Fathom brand, based around so called  “impact travel” where passengers not only take part in the usual  cruise activities like eating, drinking and sun-bathing, but have  the opportunity to learn from and work with locals in each port  of call. ', '  Passengers “will have free time and be able to go on your own a  bit, so I’m not sure it will feel that different” from a full  fledged leisure cruise, Carnival CEO Arnold Donald told CNBC in  an on-board interview. He said the cruise was completely sold  out, and there were about a dozen Cuban-born passengers on board.', '  Those factors are what makes this legal. American’s still cannot  legally visit Cuba as tourists, but they can if they qualify for  one of 12 categories, including “people-to-people” and “cultural  exchange” programs offered under Fathom’s umbrella.', '  As protesters rode along the side of the ship, passengers lined  the upper decks waving American and Cuban flags. Donald and  Fathom president Tara Russell gave a short speech to the  passengers, thanking the crew and employees that made the cruise  happen.', '  “We’re delighted to be here,” said Donald. “We’re humbled, it’s an honor, it’s a  privilege.” ', 'Other Carnival brands will be travelling to Cuba over time as port space becomes available, he said. ', '“This is not about going there like you would to another  Caribbean Island and just going to hang out at the beach. This is  not the purpose of this cruise,” said travel expert Stewart  Chiron, also known as “The Cruise Guy.” ', '  Still, the planned activities hardly seem to qualify as hard  labor. Passengers will spend their days on shore excursions,  where they will have options to experience dance and musical  performances, meet with business owners, students and artists  — all as part of their cultural exchange programs. The  experience does not come cheap, however: A balcony room for two  adults runs for nearly $9,000.', '  “It’s not cheap but we are still a better value if you were to go  by air and book your own travel,” Donald told CNBC.', '  The Adonia will travel to Cuba every other week with stops in  three ports of call; Havana, Cienfuegos and Santiago de Cuba.  During the off weeks, the ship will be in the Dominican Republic  on a similar impact travel trip. That trip however, comes at  nearly a third of the cost. ', '  Chiron explained that the cost is “disproportionate compared to  the same cruise on the same ship that is going to the Dominican  Republic.” However he added it’s worth the money, especially  considering the historical value. ', '  “Right now they are the only game in town so why leave money on  the table? It is going to provide a very unique experience that  no one else can offer,” Chiron said. ', '  The trip almost didn’t happen. Just weeks before the Adonia was  set to leave Miami for Havana, Carnival came under heavy pressure  from anti-Castro activists. At the time, the company said it  would hold off on the trip until the Cuban government allowed  Cuban-born Americans to travel to the island nation by sea — a prohibition against that had been on the books in Cuba for  decades. ', '  Yet with just days to spare, the countries government made a  concession — allowing Cuban born Americans to travel to Cuba  by sea, something they had been allowed to do by air for  years. ', '  With law changed, one can expect more cruise companies aiming  their ships towards Cuba. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings is one  of those companies: The company’s president and (Cuban-born) CEO  Frank Del Rio said in a recent statement that Norwegian’s Oceania  brand “continues discussions with Cuban officials seeking  approval to commence cruises to Cuba later this year.”', '  Del Rio added that he has “every confidence that the Cuban  government would allow its natural born citizens to visit the  island nation by cruise ship as they have allowed Cuban Americans  to travel by air for years. I am very much looking forward to  sailing to Cuba soon aboard one of our ships in the company of  many fellow Cuban Americans and other fellow Americans who wish  to share in the excitement and passion that cruising to Cuba  brings.”', '  That said, there are lingering questions as to whether or not  Cuba itself can handle the influx of tourists and cruise ships.  Docking space is extremely limited throughout the island. That  means companies which hope to send larger cruise vessels to the  Island may have to consider using tenders to get passengers to  and from the actual port. ', '  “There will have to be a lot of tenders to be able to transport  passengers because they don’t have the docking facilities to  handle these large ships,” Chiron said. “Countries have spent  hundreds of millions of dollars building up their port  infrastructure so this type of a boom is not going to happen  overnight.” ', 'While Congress has not yet approved American tourism to Cuba, Donald says that Carnival is following the approved forms of travel dictated by the government. ', '“You can still have a great time within those confines,” he said. “You’ll get to experience all the beautiful things in Cuba, we make it easy. There’s no better way than to go on Fathom ... Cuba has been very cooperative.”', 'He also believes that a stop in Cuba will reinvigorate the line’s trips to the Caribbean, calling it “refreshing” for people who have been to the Caribbean before and are looking for something new.

64,Frequent travelers will love these new charging technologies,2019-06-23T14:00:19+0000,"['There are two kinds of new charging technologies that you need to know about. If you travel a lot, they’ll help you cut down on the number of chargers you need to bring with you. You might even want to just bring one for all of your devices.', 'And, better yet, one of the technologies, a USB specification called Power Delivery (PD), charges your devices as fast as possible, which means you’ll spend less time waiting for your phone, tablet or computer to get to 100%.', 'If you’ve used battery packs in the past and hate that they take forever to recharge, or if you’re tired of carrying several chargers for all of your gadgets, then you’ll like what you’re about to hear.', 'Charging has changed. let me explain.', 'The chargers that you use to plug your gadgets into the wall don’t have to be huge.', 'New gallium nitride (GaN) chargers are now shipping, and they include another new technology called Power Delivery.', 'Put simply, these wall chargers are the parts that your computer, tablet or phone use to plug into a wall. Normally, you might just use the one that comes with your computer, but they can either be really big and heavy, or they don’t charge your device as fast as it was built to. Apple, for example, still ships 5-watt chargers with its iPhones, even though you can charge it faster using up to an 18-watt charger. And this applies for all sorts of gadgets.', 'GaN allows the chargers to be smaller and Power Delivery allows them to deliver enough power to charge quickly.', 'Previously, you might have had to buy an iPad charger for your iPhone to get it to charge faster than the one that comes in the box. Or you could use your bulky MacBook charger for all three. But GaN chargers are super small, just slightly bigger than an iPhone charger, and they have the power to charge up to 30-watt or 45-watt devices, like a laptop. It can power your devices as long as they use the new USB-C standard.', 'What this all means is that GaN gives you the power you need in a small, compact charger that works with multiple devices and charges them quickly. So long as your product uses USB-C charging and supports Power Delivery (most new stuff does), you’re good to go. You don’t need to carry three chargers, just a single one that works with multiple products.', 'You can use a gadget like Anker’s 30W Ultra Compact Type-C Wall Charger. I bought one and use it everywhere I go to charge everything from my phone to a Nintendo Switch. The 30-watt rating is enough for MacBooks, the MacBook Air, the iPad, iPhones and Android devices. If you need something for a MacBook Pro or a similar Windows laptop that uses USB-C charging but needs up to 45-watts, a company named RAVPower has one.', 'While GaN paired with Power Delivery is great for when you have an outlet, sometimes you need to charge on the go. That’s where new Power Delivery battery packs come in. These, like the chargers, automatically charge your gadgets at the maximum speed possible, again thanks to the smarts built in to Power Delivery and USB-C.', 'Some battery packs don’t support up to 30-watts or 45-watts, however, which means they don’t have enough power to juice your laptop on the go. So, if you want something that can charge up all of your devices, look for ones that go up to 30-watts (MacBook, MacBook Air) or 45-watts (MacBook Pro, Dell XPS 13). And look for one with a lot of capacity. I like 10,000mAh or more in a battery pack, but up to 20,000mAh or more if I want it to charge a laptop, too.', 'Importantly, Power Delivery works two ways. So, while these higher capacity battery packs used to take 12 to 18 hours too charge fully, they now can charge in 4-6 hours. That means you have a pack that can juice up your iPhone 5 times, an iPad at least once or twice, or a full laptop charge, in your bag all the time.', 'I have a few models I like. OmniCharge sent me its new OmniCharge 20+, which I love. (It’s out of stock at time of publication on Amazon, but the company says more will be available in a week.) It charges itself quickly, has enough capacity to power up all of my gadgets, and even has wireless charging built in to the top so you can juice up AirPods or your phone without plugging it in.', 'A small display also indicates how much power it’s outputting or receiving, so you can tell if your gadget is getting as much juice as it can. The company also sells a smaller 12,800mAh pack for $69.99, which works well and still includes wireless charging and Power Delivery, but can’t fill your gadgets as many times. These don’t come with a Power Delivery wall charger, however, so you’ll want to buy something like the Anker product above also.', 'You might also consider the Anker PowerCore Speed 20000 PD, 20100mAh Portable Charger & 30W Power Delivery Wall Charger Bundle, which I bought for $99.99 and bring with me everywhere. It doesn’t have wireless charging, but it has plenty of juice and includes the Power Delivery wall charger for juicing up the pack as fast as possible, usually in about four to five hours.', 'All of this might sound a bit confusing, but I’ve tried to make it as simple as possible. If you carry a lot of gadgets or travel a lot, you need two things: A new GaN charger with Power Delivery and a new battery pack with Power Delivery. You’ll need to carry fewer chargers, and everything you own will charge at maximum speed. You’ll carry less weight, fewer chargers and save time.', 'Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.']"

And yes, that means you’ll need to drop $19 on a plug that works with the new type of cable that comes with the iPhone 12 to enable faster charging. (Don’t worry, you can still keep your old iPhone’s plug and charging cord and it’ll work with the new iPhone 12.)', 'Despite Apple’s claim that the absence of the plug was a pro-environment move, it’s on track to see an uptick in its hardware accessories and wearables category thanks to the sale of the plugs and the new ecosystem it’s building around the iPhone 12′s MagSafe charging system.', 'That category, which includes products such as the Apple Watch, AirPods, chargers and other accessories, has already shown promising growth. Sales jumped nearly 17% to $6.45 billion in Apple’s fiscal third quarter. Apple is scheduled to report its fiscal fourth-quarter results on Oct. 29, but it won’t reflect sales of the iPhone 12 and related products, which went on sale Friday.', 'Accessories and wearables are following a similar story we’ve seen with Apple’s services business, which includes digital products such as streaming music and iCloud storage. With iPhone sales no longer showing growth, Apple has come up with new digital products to leverage more out of its user base of about 1 billion iPhone users. Apple generated $13.16 billion in services revenue for the fiscal third quarter, up nearly 15% from the year before.', 'Between the missing plug ($19), missing wired earphones (wireless AirPods start at $159) and the new MagSafe charger ($39) for the iPhone 12, Apple is poised to see a significant boost in accessory sales this quarter. On top of that, Apple has a new $99 version of the HomePod speaker that goes on sale next month and the Apple Watch is cheaper than ever, starting at $199.', 'Deutsche Bank analysts picked up on that potential growth in a research note earlier this week.', '“While [Apple] claims that they are not shipping earphones and a charging cube with the iPhone to save the environment (they are including a charging cord), the reality is that such a decision could drive a financial benefit for the company as well,” the Deutsche Bank analysts wrote.', 'Looking beyond the near-term sales of the iPhone 12, Apple’s new magnetic charging system, MagSafe, is laying the groundwork for even more accessories for the iPhone. There have long been rumors that Apple’s ultimate goal is to remove the charging port in the iPhone, like it did for the standard headphone jack, which will in turn drive iPhone owners to buy even more extras for their devices.', 'Maybe Apple is sincere when it says removing standard accessories from the iPhone box is good for the environment. When you’re shipping tens of millions of iPhones per quarter with less packaging and plastic, there’s sure to be a positive impact on the environment. But at that scale, it also drives iPhone customers to buy more high-margin extras from Apple so they can get the most out of their iPhone. And that keeps revenues growing.']"

Such heightened demand resulted in supply chain snafus, forcing Peloton to shell out more money to speed deliveries. Nonetheless, growth was coming much easier than it could have imagined. Peloton’s quarterly revenue ballooned to more than $1 billion for the first time, as the year came to a close.', 'Just two years ago, Peloton counted 511,000 connected fitness subscribers. Now, the company boasts 2.33 million. These are people who shell out $39 per month to access Peloton’s digital workout content, in addition to owning one of the company’s at-home fitness machines.', 'Its stock has gone along for the ride, too. Peloton was one of the biggest gainers on the Nasdaq 100 last year, with shares rallying 434% in 2020. But so far this year, its share price has tumbled nearly 30%, closing Friday at $104.34, as investors stare down a new reality.', 'Wall Street has mixed opinions on where the stock might go next. According to FactSet, analysts’ average price target is $133.40. That’s solidly above its 52-week low of $68.06 last August. But a good measure below its all-time high of $171.09 in January.', 'What many can agree on, though, is that Peloton’s path to profitability is changing.', '“If you had told me yesterday that Peloton would guide to 1.3 million connected fitness net adds for fiscal 2022, I would’ve said the stock would be up 10%,” J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth said in a note to clients. “But the composition of how Peloton is getting there is different than expected.

Since 2011, the company has released several new products, including the Apple Watch and AirPods.', 'Cook’s Apple is significantly bigger than it was when he took over, and it also faces new challenges, from navigating politics around the world to the perennial question about what its next big product is.', 'Ultimately, Apple’s board is happy with Cook and his performance. In September, Apple’s board granted Cook shares and performance-based awards that could give him more than 1 million Apple shares through 2026, his first stock grant since he took over.', 'Here’s Cook’s 10-year report card.', 'Cook had been acting CEO before he officially took over, but the difference between the quarter before Cook took charge and today’s sales underscores how much larger Apple has gotten.', 'In the third fiscal quarter of 2011, Apple reported $28.57 billion in revenue. This year, in the same quarter and the most recent quarter which figures are available, Apple reported $81.4 billion in sales — nearly three times as much.', 'Apple’s iPhone alone accounted for nearly $39.6 billion last quarter, which is more than the company’s entire sales when Cook took over.', 'Investors would be happy if they bought Apple on Cook’s first day. An investment of $1,000 in Apple stock on Aug. 24, 2011, would be worth more than $16,866 as of Monday, an over 32% annual rate of return if they reinvested all dividends. The S&P 500 only returned just more than 16% annually over the same period.', 'Apple has worked to reduce its share count through stock buybacks.

Cook testified in court for the first time as CEO during that trial. Apple also faces legislation currently being debated in Congress which would force the company to change the way it administers its software stores. Apple has denied that it holds a monopoly over its app store.', 'Apple also gets questions about what its next big product may be. It’s been investing heavily in researching self-driving electric cars, but a release date is likely years away. It is working in the health world to allow users to store medical records and communicate with their doctors, but Apple hasn’t released any health hardware except for its Apple Watch.

The report recommended a wide range of remedies, including splitting different business units and forcing companies to prove mergers would be pro-competitive before allowing them to conclude. ', 'In Amazon’s case, for instance, the company could be required to split apart its core e-commerce site from the third-party marketplace where independent vendors sell their products, and from the Amazon Web Services cloud-computing service. ', 'The committee’s report bucked industry figures estimating Amazon’s controlling share of the e-commerce market. They said Amazon likely controls about 50% or more of the U.S. online retail market, which is higher than researcher eMarketer’s estimate of 38%. ', 'Amazon has stifled competition in other areas than retail, lawmakers found. They concluded that Amazon’s role as a dominant provider of cloud-computing services and its power in other markets creates a conflict of interest that “Amazon has the incentive and ability to exploit.” Amazon has also imposed barriers to entry for other voice-enabled device manufacturers by pricing its Alexa-enabled products below cost, lawmakers said. ', 'Amazon also operates more than 150 fulfillment centers, sortation centers and delivery stations, along with a sprawling network of planes, vans and contracted delivery drivers. This combination has allowed Amazon to ship a growing number number of products itself, rivaling UPS and FedEx, and serves as one of several barriers to entry for competitors. The “steep costs” associated with building a logistics network that’s comparable in size to what Amazon has built makes “a challenger to Amazon unlikely,” they said.', 'SEE ALSO: ', 'Facebook is a social network monopoly that buys, copies or kills competitors, antitrust committee finds', 'Apple’s ‘monopoly power’ over iPhone app distribution gives it outsized profits, Democrats say', 'Google ‘overwhelmingly’ dominates search market, antitrust committee states', 'Amazon disputed the lawmakers’ findings, saying that their recommendations would reduce competition, forcing “millions of independent retailers out of online stores” and resulting in less choice and higher prices for consumers.', '“All large organizations attract the attention of regulators, and we welcome that scrutiny. But large companies are not dominant by definition, and the presumption that success can only be the result of anti-competitive behavior is simply wrong,” the company said. “And yet, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, those fallacies are at the core of this regulatory spit-balling on antitrust.”', 'In some cases, the threat of competing with Amazon can push start-ups to avoid certain industries entirely.', 'One unnamed venture capital investor in the cloud market told lawmakers: “I think of Amazon as the sun. It is useful but also dangerous. If you’re far enough away you can bask. If you get too close you’ll get incinerated. So, you have to be far enough from Amazon and be doing something that they wouldn’t do. If you’re a net consumer of Amazon’s infrastructure, like Uber, then you’re okay. As long as Amazon doesn’t want to get into ridesharing. But it’s hard to predict what Amazon wants to get into. If they were going to stop at retail and computing, you’re safe. But you can’t know.”', 'Lawmakers also found direct evidence that Amazon viewed Zappos and Quidsi as “competitive threats prior to acquiring them,” citing documents reviewed by subcommittee staff.', 'Before Amazon acquired Zappos in 2009, it referred to the online shoe retailer as one of the “primary competitors” of Amazon’s now-defunct fashion website Endless.com. Zappos gave Endless access to “hold-out” brands that previously “refused to sell on Amazon.com” or Endless, lawmakers said. Similarly, Amazon sought to acquire Quidsi in 2010 after it engaged in an “aggressive price war” to weaken its subsidiary Diapers.com, which was a competitor to Amazon.', 'Amazon’s third-party marketplace, made up of millions of merchants, has become a critical part of Amazon’s e-commerce business. The marketplace now accounts for more than half of Amazon’s overall sales. It has been a focus of antitrust investigators in the U.S. and abroad, who believe Amazon uses its power to squeeze the merchants that sell on its platform. ', 'Lawmakers concluded that Amazon’s dual role selling products on its own web site and running a marketplace for third-party sellers “creates an inherent conflict of interest” that encourages Amazon to exploit its access to competing sellers’ data and information. It noted that Amazon publicly describes these sellers as “partners,” but “behind closed doors, the company refers to them as ‘internal competitors.’”', 'Third-party sellers described a pervasive environment of “bullying,” wherein the threat of financial burden that comes with an account suspension or product de-listing causes some sellers to “live in fear of the company.”', 'Third-party merchants told the subcommittee that they’re often left without any recourse after their account has been shut down. When sellers have to appeal an issue with Amazon, they face such “atrocious levels of customer service” that often they resort to a “Jeff Bomb,” or an email to CEO Jeff Bezos “to plead their case.”', '“For sellers, Amazon functions as a ‘quasistate,’ and many ‘[s]ellers are more worried about a case being opened on Amazon than in actual court,’” lawmakers said. ', 'Amazon’s own documents show that it manipulates its all-important buy box algorithm “to do what is best for Amazon’s bottom line, not customers” lawmakers said. The buy box offers customers a one-click button to add a listed product to their shopping cart or buy it. ', 'This directly contradicts Amazon’s previous explanation for how the buy box works. Amazon has maintained that the buy box predicts the price consumers would most likely choose after reviewing competing products elsewhere.', 'Amazon also employs “strong-arm tactics” in negotiations with vendors who sell directly to the company, lawmakers said. The report references an exchange with an unnamed company, wherein Amazon leveraged its e-commerce dominance to force acceptance of certain terms and conditions. During negotiations, Amazon “repeatedly referenced” its ability to destock the unnamed company’s products on as a “bargaining chip to force terms” that were “unrelated to retail distribution.” ', 'Lawmakers argued that Amazon’s scope, acquisitions, and pricing strategy have given it an unfair advantage in the voice enabled assistant market. ', 'Amazon’s Alexa Voice Service, which enables hardware makers to make their devices compatible with Amazon’s Alexa digital assistant, is hosted on AWS, “allowing it to bind products and developers to its cloud platform.” This may also give Amazon a “potential head-start” in converting those Alexa partners into customers of AWS or other Amazon services in the future,” they said. ', 'Amazon has expanded Alexa’s ecosystem quickly through acquisitions of complementary and competing technology, lawmakers said. Internal emails between Amazon executives revealed that Amazon sought to control both the “eyes and ears,” with the “ears” referring to its Alexa ecosystem. Smart device makers Blink and Ring, which Amazon acquired in 2017 and 2018, respectively, would serve as “Amazon’s ‘eyes’ right outside the home,” the report said. ', 'The company also favors Amazon services with default voice commands on Alexa devices, including AmazonBasics and Prime Music, and users must go out of their way to voice shop on other stores, lawmakers said. When it comes to its online marketplace, Amazon acts as a “gatekeeper” against competitors, using the threat of delisting a competitor’s product to “ensure that Alexa is enabled on other company’s devices, or to secure favorable contractual terms.”', 'Democrats concluded that Amazon uses a “predatory pricing strategy to increase its sales of smart home devices by pricing its products below cost.” This strategy has created “significant” barriers to entry for companies looking to compete in the voice enabled assistant market and even created challenges for fellow tech giant Google. In a 2018 email, one Google employee remarked that “fighting Amazon with a very-hard-to-differentiate product and a channel disadvantage and a huge economic disadvantage (due to channel mix margin differences) is already like fighting a shark on a surfboard.”', 'AWS is more profitable than the rest of Amazon, and that profit from the cloud business allows Amazon to keep funding its business, the subcommittee said. ', 'Amazon leads the cloud-infrastructure market. The subcommittee found evidence suggested that AWS sought to build on its leadership position and keep existing customers from going elsewhere.', 'More people know how to use Amazon’s cloud than other clouds, making it easier to choose Amazon and harder to leave, and the high cost of migrating to other clouds helps AWS maintain its strength, the subcommittee asserted. ', 'Amazon also charges customers when they went to send data out of AWS, and people told the subcommittee that “they view these fees less as a cost for Amazon to transport data and more as friction imposed by Amazon for switching providers.” Because Amazon is dominant in cloud computing and other markets, the company has a conflict of interest it can take advantage of, the subcommittee said.', 'AWS’ has built services based on open-source projects such as Elasticsearch and MongoDB that compete with services built by the companies that first developed those open-source software projects. These services, including AWS’ DocumentDB database service that draws on MongoDB, could wind up locking customers into AWS, the subcommittee argued.', '“When a cloud customer chooses to build an application using DocumentDB they are tied to AWS’s infrastructure,” the report said. “If they ever wanted to switch to another provider they would have to extensively re-engineer their product in another software, whereas, had they built their application using MongoDB — on AWS or any other cloud provider’s infrastructure — their applications could move to other platforms.” ', 'MongoDB and other software companies responded by changing the licenses on their open-source libraries. People told the committee they thought the license changes could lead to lesser access to innovative software for groups that lack abundant financial resources. Many people think AWS makes more from their versions of open-source software than third-party providers, the report said.']"
74,Ron Insana: Rebuilding the American economy to bring peace and prosperity to all,2020-05-31T13:20:04+0000,"[' ', 'It has long been evident, though not necessarily obvious to all, that the ground of America’s economy was shifting beneath our feet.', 'The very institutions that laid the foundation upon which the “American Dream” was built, were in decay.', 'Their facades may still have been bright and reasonably well-maintained, but their interior walls became discolored and their support beams rusty and fragile.', 'A dozen years ago, it became increasingly apparent to me that something more than half-measures and lip-service were required to re-lay that foundation to ensure prosperity for all, particularly, for the next generations to come.', 'Indeed, when I first thought of writing this column, I was among those recommending that the U.S. rebuild the entirety of its infrastructure to stimulate an economy ravaged by the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) and subsequent Great Recession while using that crisis to bring the U.S. economy fully into the 21st Century.', 'Sadly, amid the building hyper-partisanship in Washington, President Obama was only able to pass $800 billion in relief and stimulus. That was far short of the estimated $4 trillion required to do the job.', 'The bill that was passed barely allotted any money for rebuilding anything.', 'Instead, it was used to fill state and local budget gaps, extend unemployment insurance and offset a small portion of the $17 trillion in capital losses accumulated in the GFC.', 'Rebuilding our physical infrastructure; hardening our critical infrastructure; updating the nation’s electrical grid; modernizing federal, state and local technology and procuring productivity-enhancing tools simply has not been, and still isn’t, a true priority of the Federal government despite the obvious and increasingly pressing need.', 'While this was exposed, in stark relief, during the Great Financial Crisis, it was illustrated even more clearly, only a decade later, as America faced its first great plague in over 100 years.', 'Like the GFC, the emergence of the coronavirus and subsequent economic lockdown, made quite plain the structural reforms needed to revive the U.S.', 'It also exposed the deepest of racial divisions that still plague this nation.', 'The deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade or Breonna Taylor, along with a disproportionate number of people of color killed by the coronavirus, have made, more clear and vivd than ever,  the institutionalized racism that has prevented every citizen, no matter their race, creed, color or religion, from obtaining equality of opportunity, if not outcome.', 'Beyond that, there remains a pressing need to make America truly great for a next generation of Americans while also supporting a recovery strong enough to restore normal daily life to the citizens of today.', 'Consider the implications of the virus-induced recession that has toppled the domestic and global economy.', 'America’s longest expansion was stopped dead in its tracks by the Corona virus pandemic.', 'While the virulence of this illness is not unprecedented in human history, the Bubonic Plague and the “Spanish” flu killed more people, the sudden impact that disrupted economic life in 2020 is without parallel.', 'Within only a matter of weeks, 90% of the American population was told to “shelter-in-place.” By early April of 2020, some 25%-50% of the nation’s economic output was completely shut off.', 'In the first ten weeks of the American pandemic alone, some 41 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits, many times the number of the previous peak in filings.', 'It has been estimated that the unemployment rate will top 30%, exceeding the highest jobless figures of the Great Depression, while the economy could contract by as much as 30-60% when all is said and done, marking the deepest economic decline on record.', 'Economists hope that recovery from the pandemic will be speedy, both in terms of the human and economic toll. But such optimism, while typical of Americans of all stripes, may be misplaced.', 'For the first time in modern history, we’ve witnessed just how deeply our most cherished institutions have fallen into disrepair.', 'The anti-science approach of President Trump has led to delays and mixed messages from infectious disease experts, likely exacerbating both the human and economic toll.', 'His divisive comments, as race riots erupted around the country, propelled us back in time, much as his economic policies are wont to do, to 1968 and to that summer of violence and discontent that scarred an entire generation of anti-establishment youths.', 'As a consequence, the disruption and associated behavioral changes that took place as the pandemic, and subsequent violence, spread may well have long-term consequences.', 'That does not mean the U.S. won’t ultimately recover.

76,These electric submarines map the seafloor to make way for wind power,2021-08-19T12:57:29+0000,"['In March, the departments of Energy, Interior and Commerce said they were aiming for U.S. offshore wind capacity to hit 30 gigawatts (GW) by 2030, a hugely optimistic goal that would require thousands of new wind turbines to be installed off the Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf coasts.', 'With federal support locked in, now it’s up to developers and operators to figure out where it’s safe to install offshore wind farms and pursue permits.', 'Bedrock, a Richmond, California, start-up, wants to help them map the seafloor using electric autonomous underwater vehicles (e-AUV) that can launch right from the shore.', 'Traditionally, marine surveys would require a large, crewed ship and heavy sonar equipment that would generate terabytes of data stored on hard drives that had to be mailed somewhere for processing and analysis.', 'Marine surveys like that can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and take up to a full year, says Bedrock co-founder and CEO Anthony DiMare.', 'By contrast his company’s electric mini sub gathers data using lighter-weight sonar and other sensors, then transmits it to Bedrock’s cloud-based service. The company’s Mosaic software makes it usable almost right away from a work PC.', 'Bedrock’s electric submarines run on a lithium-ion battery that can be swapped out for a freshly charged one when needed. They run for 12- or 24-hour missions, typically at a speed of 2 to 3 knots (or less than 5 mph) to conduct surveys up to 300 meters in depth.', 'Bedrock was co-founded in 2019 by DiMare, a repeat entrepreneur and mechanical engineer, along with CTO Charlie Chiau, a former SpaceX systems integration engineer.', 'They told CNBC the company is focused on the needs of the domestic offshore wind industry right now, further motivated by the urgency of the IPCC report earlier this month.', 'However, Bedrock’s seafloor mapping technology can be put to use in many other industries. For example, it can find aging oil and gas infrastructure that may need to be decommissioned. It can also be used for data center planning underwater.', 'To test the AUVs before they’re taken to the open water, Chiau says Bedrock has installed a 20-foot long, 5-foot deep circular tank in its Richmond office. This functions like an underwater treadmill, mimicking currents and conditions an electric submarine would likely encounter in an ocean or perhaps the Great Lakes.', 'The company has just one electric submarine operating commercially at this time, but the founders intend to build and send fleets of them into the water.', 'In March, Bedrock closed an $8 million seed round of funding, which it plans to use for hiring, refinements and production of more of its electric submarines, as well as cloud services and software development.', 'DiMare said the first 50 gigabytes of seafloor data will always be free for any user of the company’s Mosaic software to store and access. It was important to the co-founders that they give independent researchers and smaller teams access to the same kind of tools large renewable energy developers might have.', 'Near term, Bedrock expects to make money by selling seafloor mapping and software as a service. It will send electric AUVs to scan a specific “polygon” -- essentially a plot of land on the seafloor -- collect data, clean it up and hand it over to customers via Mosaic.', 'To ensure that employees at Bedrock have a personal connection to the ocean, and a strong commitment to protecting marine ecosystems, the start-up gives new hires what DiMare and Chiau call an “ocean allowance.” This perk can go toward any activity, like scuba diving lessons, surfboard rentals or a guided kayaking tour.', 'The company is aiming to double its head count from around 25 employees today to 50 in the next year, and to help the U.S. catch up to European nations, and eventually China, when it comes to offshore wind capacity.', 'The U.S. has been a global laggard with just one active offshore wind facility that started commercial operations in 2016 -- the 30 MW Block Island Wind Farm.', 'Correction: This story has been updated to reflect Bedrock’s submarines can scan depths up to 300 meters.']"
