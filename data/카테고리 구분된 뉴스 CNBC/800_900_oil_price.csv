Saudi Arabia is the world’s biggest exporter of crude, while Qatar is home to substantial natural gas resources.', 'But a diplomatic dispute will not necessarily threaten supplies. Amid a global glut, other countries could easily step in to fill the void, provided tensions in the region do not escalate.', 'More from New York Times: Trial will decide if ABC News sullied a company with ’pink slime’‘Wonder Woman’ could be the superhero women in Hollywood needA tax cut might be nice. But remember the deficit.', 'Investors seem to be making that calculus. While oil prices initially spiked 1.6 percent on Monday, the markets quickly fell back to just above $50 a barrel.', '“It is very difficult to see how this break in diplomatic relations would lead to a disruption of oil supplies,” said Paul Stevens, a Middle East oil specialist at Chatham House, a research organization in London.', 'Investors appear to be focused for now on the oversupply of oil, which has kept prices low for more than two years. Saudi Arabia and other major oil-exporting nations are trying to keep supplies in check, but American shale players continue to ramp up production.', 'Qatar, a member of  OPEC, helped broker last year’s agreement by the cartel and by other producers, like Russia,  to trim output in an effort to soak up supplies. Despite continuing political tensions, the parties  agreed last month to extend the cuts for nine months.', 'A small country with only 2.2 million residents — many of whom are not citizens — Qatar occupies a strategic position, jutting into the Persian Gulf from the Arabian Peninsula. Qatar has a border with Saudi Arabia and shares the world’s largest natural gas field with Iran.', 'Qatar is a relatively small oil producer with output of about 620,000 barrels a day in April, less than 1 percent of world supply. But Qatar the country is a world power in natural gas.', 'Through partnerships with Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Total and other companies, Qatar has built major infrastructure for chilling natural gas into liquid form so that it can be exported on ships. Qatar was the world’s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas last year, accounting for nearly 30 percent of supplies, according to the consultancy group Wood Mackenzie.', 'Gas has helped make Qatar one of the world’s richest countries. The government has used the steady flow of cash to intervene in regional disputes and to fund activities like the broadcast network Al Jazeera, actions that often annoy its Arab neighbors.', 'The diplomatic dispute has economic implications. Saudi Arabia has called for multinational companies to withdraw from Qatar, putting those firms in a difficult position. Major construction work is underway in preparation for Qatar’s hosting of the 2022 World Cup, for instance.', 'Disruptions of Qatar’s supplies would shake the natural gas market, but would not necessarily destabilize it. There are multiple sources of liquefied natural gas, including huge facilities developed recently in Australia, and companies are showing themselves increasingly willing and able to route cargoes to different ports according to need and price.', 'If the turmoil persists, it could threaten investment in oil and gas facilities. Even before the latest diplomatic moves against Qatar, tensions were high, stoked in part by the bitter differences between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and the fighting in Yemen and Iraq.', '“If this continues for any length of time it will have implications for the Qatari economy,” said Richard Mallinson, a geopolitical analyst at Energy Aspects, a market research firm. “The question is, do calmer heads prevail and do we see work to de-escalate.”']"

Because Hanoi maintains a strong position against Beijing’s activities in the South China Sea, Trump may eye Vietnam as a potential counter to China in the disputed area, Baker explained.', 'The world’s second-largest economy claims 90 percent of the sea, home to over 250 islands and rich natural gas reserves, while Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan assert ownership of certain parts. And as Beijing ramps up island-building and military construction in the maritime region — reports recently emerged of Chinese rocket launchers in the Spratly Islands — Hanoi has not shied away from publicly denouncing the mainland.', 'In 2014, Vietnam witnessed violent protests as demonstrators criticized China’s assertiveness in the important waterway while Vietnamese officials lambasted Beijing in March after a Chinese cruise ship visited the Paracel Islands, which are claimed by both countries.', 'China’s territorial expansion has also irked Washington, with Trump promising vowing to halt Beijing’s construction of artificial islands days after taking office. And while the president’s hands are currently tied as he seeks the mainland’s help on reigning in a hostile North Korea, the South China Sea issue still looms large — last week, the Chinese navy deployed two missile frigates to a U.S. Navy warship that sailed near the China-claimed Spratly Islands.', 'The Vietnamese PM’s visit to Washington “adds momentum to a U.S.-Vietnam relationship that is moving in an increasingly strategic direction,” Jonathan Stromseth, senior fellow at Brookings, described in a recent note.', 'Indeed, the two allies have already initiated a series of bilateral military exchanges that could raise eyebrows in Beijing.', '“Within the past week or so, Washington has delivered small vessels to the Vietnamese coast guard, there have been naval exchange visits (and) the U.S. has also waived some restrictions on arms exports to Vietnam,” said Baker, adding that he expected this type of military cooperation to continue.', 'Of course, Vietnam isn’t Trump’s sole ASEAN ally in the maritime conflict.', 'The White House has been visibly cozying up to several Southeast Asian nations “in the context of rising Chinese influence and growing concerns about the U.S. staying power in the region, particularly after (Washington’s) withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership,” Stromseth explained.', 'Over the past month, Vice President Mike Pence has visited Indonesia, Trump has telephoned several ASEAN leaders, including controversial Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has hosted ASEAN foreign ministers in Washington.', 'The White House’s demonstrated commitment to the region could “foster conditions that enable constructive multilateral engagement with China in the Asia-Pacific, helping to mitigate strategic rivalry between Washington and Beijing over the long term,” Stromseth said.']"

Nasser was speaking to reporters at a conference of scores of senior U.S. and Saudi business executives, coinciding with the visit of U.S. President Donald Trump to Riyadh.  He said 16 agreements with 11 companies would be signed, including memorandums of understanding for joint ventures. Officials said earlier that many of the agreements would flesh out previously announced plans.  “We expect the deals signed today to provide a boost to bilateral trade between both countries,” Nasser said, adding that Aramco currently spent $6.5 billion a year on goods and services from U.S. suppliers.  Among the deals, executives said, were a plan by Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. for a joint venture with Aramco to manage business projects in the kingdom, and a plan by McDermott International to transfer some of its ship fabrication facilities from Dubai to a new shipbuilding complex which Aramco will build within Saudi Arabia.  Top Saudi economic policy makers, including the finance minister and head of the kingdom’s main sovereign wealth fund, described ways in which they planned to attract U.S. capital and technology. Officials said they aimed to prepare new rules covering direct investment by foreign firms within 12 months.  “We want foreign companies to look at Saudi Arabia as a platform for exports to other markets,” Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told the conference.', 'Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.']"

In the meantime, cash on the balance sheet remains at an  elevated $1.9 trillion while long-term unemployment persists and  corporate infrastructure continues to age.', '  “Public companies should not make money just to buy back stock,”  analyst Don Rissmiller at Strategas said in an economic research  note. “The purpose of the capital markets is to fund  growth—as is commonly noted, the people with the good ideas  are not always the people with money. The capital market matches  the two.”', '  (Read more: Cashin: Why ‘the Fed is flying blind’)', '  What has happened much more often over the past five years,  though, has been a capital market that has matched cheap money  with companies more than willing to take it. They’ve used that  cash to reward the 20 percent minority that owns the lion’s share  of the stock market, to the detriment of a labor force and a  broader economy that relies on sales growth to expand.', '  Rissmiller noted that bottom-line profit for  companies has exploded 119 percent  since 2008—when the Federal Reserve began its zero interest rate  policy—while sales growth has been a paltry 7 percent.', '  “Cost-cutting (including lower interest costs) and share  repurchases have made up the difference,” he said.', '  As part of hopes for economic escape velocity for 2014, many  high-profile economists have been preaching the capex theme. But  so far the biggest headlines have come from still more buyback  intentions.', ' Apple’s intention to purchase $14 billion of its  shares has led the first-quarter buyback parade, and numerous  other companies have followed suit.', '  (Opinion: Real solutions to America’s jobs problem)', '  That hasn’t stopped the capex believers from insisting this year  will be different.', '  “If corporations begin to spend more on capital projects, they  could spend less on stock buybacks and dividend increases,” Dick  Bove, vice president of equity research at Rafferty Capital  Markets, said in a note on the topic. “This would be a corporate  taper mirroring the Federal Reserve taper.”', '  Bove’s point is an important one: Much of the stock market growth  since the lows of March 2009 can be traced directly to Fed  money-printing.', '  The central bank has expanded its balance sheet to more than $4.1  trillion, mainly through the purchases of Treasurys and  mortgage-backed securities. The purchases have dovetailed with a  near-zero interest rate policy, with the twin effects being a  fertile environment for companies to borrow low-cost money to  reduce share count and boost their stock prices.', '  But the Fed is planning on scaling back those purchases this  year, with the market believing that the quantitative easing program will be over by the end of  2014.', '  (Read more: Helping the rich to become $100 trillion industry)', '  Corporate America, then, will be left to take the handoff for  growth, something that would have to be done through expansion.  S&P 500 companies have set multiple records for profit by  slashing employment and expenses, but have cut to the bone and  will have to spend money on capital and labor if they want to  grow more.', '  Bove and others point to a few supporting factors for capex this  year: Productivity—often a leading indicator for  capex—has shown some signs of life lately, while banks have  indicated in Fed surveys a willingness to make commercial and  industrial loans, the backbone of capex growth.', '  Finally, chief financial officers responding to the most recent  Duke University CFO Survey project a 7.3 percent increase in  capex for 2014, up from the anemic 2013 where spending barely hit  3 percent.', '  “Hopefully what those numbers drive home is it’s not a flash in  the pan sort of idea,” Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC  Capital Markets, said in an interview. “These are the  foundational sort of components of a capex story. If that’s true,  then they’re also thematic.”', '  Not all capex is created equal, though.', '  (Read more: Did stimulus work? Five years later debate rages on)', '  S&P Capital IQ senior index analyst Howard Silverblatt said  the numbers in the Duke survey sound about right for capital  spending this year, but it may not manifest itself in ways that  foster strong growth.', '  “The means to get there, for what we’re looking for, is new jobs. That speaks to a new plant or bringing in that second shift  or expansion,” he said. “We haven’t seen the new plants and the  ships yet.”', '  What Silverblatt did see in the fourth quarter through his data  analysis at S&P is another huge period for stock  buybacks—about 31 percent higher on an annualized  basis. ', '  “More companies are doing it  They have the ability to do  it—the cash is high,” he said. “We still don’t see ... new  plants being built, ships being added. We see a lot of  maintenance work, efficiency things, but not where I’m building a  new plant.”', '  In addition to the simple hope for more capex, there is some  evidence that companies are putting money to work.', '  Mergers and acquisitions, for example, have surged out of the  gate, with $266 billion committed in the U.S. in 2014, the highest  year-to-date level since 2000, according to Dealogic. The $69.8  billion bid from CNBC.com-parent Comcast to purchase Time Warner Cable greatly helped drive that  number.', '  However, M&A is not generally associated with employment  growth, though it can help plant the seeds for future expansion.', '  In the interim, investors, after being content with simply  watching their portfolios grow thanks to cost-cutting and Fed  largesse, have indicated their sentiments are changing.', '  The most recent Bank of America Merrill Lynch Fund Manager  Survey, released earlier this week, showed investors “demanding  corporates put their cash to work in the real economy.”', '  (Read more: Welcome to the good news/bad news economy)', '  A record 69 percent of respondents said companies are  underinvesting, while the gap between investors demanding capex  against returning cash to shareholders also grew to a record 33  percentage points—58 percent to 25 percent.', '  They don’t appear optimistic about getting their way, though,  with eight of 10 predicting below-trend growth and a tendency for  investors to avoid committing their own cash until they see capex  increasing.', '  A survey at the end of 2013 backs up that sentiment, with Factset  predicting just a 1.6 percent increase in 2014 due to a slowdown  in telecom and utilities.', '  Still, the hope persists.', '  “Early on in the recovery capex was the one thing that was really  keeping economic activity afloat,” Porcelli said. “We have since  pulled back as the 2013 number would suggest.

Alcala, a member of a self-defense group that rose up in arms in  Aquila this summer to kick the cartel out, said the cartel also  had been hiring people to extract the ore without permits, and  then exporting it through another Pacific coast port, Manzanillo.', '  “They weren’t content with getting our money and robbing our  trucks, so they began secretly extracting our minerals,” Alcala  said.', '  Ternium said in a statement that it has received reports of  irregular mining near its operations in Aquila.', '  (Read More: New BHP CEO takes pay cut as miners suffer, strips out top jobs)', '  “Those have been passed on to the appropriate authorities,” the  company said in a statement.', '  Government figures show the amount of iron ore being exported to  China quadrupled between 2008 and the first half of 2013, rising  to 4.6 million tons per year, precisely during the period the La  Familia cartel and later the Knights Templar cemented their  control over Michoacan.', '  In 2008,Lazaro Cardenas handled only 1.5 percent of Mexico’s iron  ore exports to China;by mid-2013, the seaport was shipping out  nearly half.', '  In 2010,the attorney general’s office estimated the cartels  shipped 1.1 million tons of illegally extracted iron ore abroad  that year.', '  Officials said the export scheme may have involved other sea  ports, and that more military takeovers may be necessary.', 'The cartel mining issue also resurfaced last year in the  coal-mining state of Coahuila bordering Texas.

So far, none of the accusations have been proven.', '  The only known arrests related to cartel mining operations  occurred in Michoacan in 2010, when Ignacio Lopez Medina, an  alleged member of La Familia, was accused of selling ore  illegally to China, the federal Attorney General’s Office said at  the time.', '  But the arrest apparently came to little; the Attorney General’s  Office could not say whether Lopez Medina had been tried or  convicted of that crime, nor could The Associated Press determine  if he is represented by a lawyer or is still in custody.', '  The Chinese Chamber of Commerce did not immediately respond to  requests for information on companies that have been involved in  buying ore from cartels, knowingly or otherwise.', '  (Read More: China’s big  moment—the  commodities set to benefit)', '  The Chinese Foreign Ministry declined to comment on whether China  had any measures in place to ensure the legal provenance of such  imports.', '  The iron ore, meanwhile, has both swelled the cartels’ bankrolls,  giving them more money to buy guns and bribe officials, and fed  the hunger of Asian steel mills.', '  And it maybe a two-way trade: Precursor chemicals the cartel uses  to make methamphetamines often arrive from China at both the  Lazaro Cardenas and Manzanillo ports.', ' —By Associated Press.']"
10,Don’t bet against Aaron Levie,2013-11-26T19:47:46+0000,"['  Aaron Levie is pacing onstage, a microphone in one hand and a  coffee in the other. His Kramer-like hair bobs above his head.  We’re in the lunchroom of Box’s 97,000-square-foot Los Altos,  Calif., headquarters, and a group of about 50 new Box   employees, mostly in their 20s, sit on steel picnic tables  facing Levie.', '  “There are phases in technology,” Levie announces, midway through  a presentation that sounds more like a TED talk than a welcome  speech. “Mainframe to PC, PC to cloud, to cloud and mobile. These  things come around every 10 to 15 years, and we’re in one right  now.”', '  He pivots and changes direction.', '  “And what that means,” Levie continues, “is that it’s a catalyst  for IT buyers to implement the next generation of technologies  that they’re going to run their businesses off of. This  opportunity did not exist in ’03 or ‘05 or ‘07 or ‘08 or ’09.   It is happening right now.”', '  Levie leaves no room for doubt: The hard drive is finally dead.  The PC is on life support. The office worker of today has gone  rogue; most likely, you and your employees are accessing your  files from iPhones or Android phones or maybe tablets. All the  trends we’ve been hearing about for years -- the consumerization  of IT, BYOD (Bring  Your Own Device), software as a service -- are now fully upon  us. The research company Gartner predicts that by 2015, at least  60 percent of information workers will be accessing their content  on mobile devices.', '  For IT departments, the convergence of these trends presents an  extraordinary challenge: How do you manage so much information on so many  different platforms?', '  “You have iPads, Android devices; you have iPhones; you have  Macs,” Levie tells his new recruits. “It’s changing the IT  landscape fundamentally. And we have to make sure that we’re  growing as aggressively as possible, selling to all the CIOs as  the solution to run their business on.”', '  (More from Inc.com Entrepreneur of the Year Runners-Up  2013: Finally, a company that’s really, truly both  innovative and disruptive: Aereo The hottest start-up you’ve never heard of:  MongoDB How a dorm room side project became Acquia, the  web’s hottest content management system)', '  Box has about 20 million users, spread out among 180,000  businesses, who use the platform to upload files, collaborate,  and share content online. Box has customers at 97 percent of the  companies on the Fortune 500.', '  “We have to build the best brand,” Levie says, “and we have to  develop our site around the enterprise. If you don’t become the  company that rallies developers in the ecosystem, you don’t get  to have the network effects.”', '  His speech is winding down. He clicks to the last slide.', '  “What we’re relying on is that we can build enough traction, get  enough of the industry, that we become the de facto platform in  enterprise,” he says. “That gives us a launch-off point into a  bunch of other services. It will be determined in the next year  and a half to two years, because the market is adopting this  right now.”', '  Levie asks for questions, and an awkward pause ensues. He stands  there sipping his coffee, eyeing the room, when, finally, an  employee raises a hand.', '  “Is it possible for a company to last forever?” the employee  asks.', '  Levie laughs, a sort of nerdish chortle that echoes through the  room.', '  “Well, um, ha ha, yeah,” Levie says. “I appreciate you think I  know the answer to that. So that’s good. And…the answer is  yes. It is possible. And we will be that company!”', '  The recruits laugh as Levie takes a moment to actually consider  the question.', '  “I mean, it’s possible we won’t even have capitalism in 200  years. Maybe the Internet even won’t exist. The idea is that  you’re always talking about disrupting, always talking about  what’s next.”', '  Box, which Levie launched out of his dorm room at the University  of Southern California in 2005, is a golden child among Silicon  Valley tech companies. The company has more than doubled its  revenue every year and is on pace to reach $100 million by the  end of 2013. Box has more than 900 employees, spread out in  offices in Los Altos, San Francisco, London, Paris, and Munich.  Next year, Levie and his co-founder and chief financial officer  (and boyhood friend), Dylan Smith, plan to take the company  public.', '  Investors, who have poured $300 million into the start-up, are  valuing the business at $1.2 billion -- a sign both of their  belief in Box and their confidence that cloud  computing has finally matured. In one recent survey of IT  buyers, researchers noted a “whopping 65.6% of respondents  indicated cloud as a top investment area for 2013.”', '  Even these numbers, however, don’t explain why Aaron Levie is  Inc.’s Entrepreneur of the Year. That has more to do  with his anticipation of change and his boldness in doing what  looks crazy in the short term but in time looks revolutionary.  Cloud storage is basically a commodity. Levie recognized this  early on and changed Box’s orientation from consumers to  enterprise customers, where his relentless focus on great design  was particularly striking -- and thus he put some distance  between Box and the pressures of the commodity marketplace. He  moved quickly into mobile. He got out in front of fears about  security. He was, and is, unencumbered by legacy ideas and  models, and he keeps making good decisions.', '  Levie likes to say that fundamental shifts in technology come  around only every 10 to 15 years, and much the same could be said  about an entrepreneur like him. He possesses the sort of wisdom  and focus you’d expect of an industry guru, but he acts with the  24/7 obsession of a scrappy start-up founder. Give him 10  minutes, and he will make you a believer. Scott Weiss, a partner  at Andreessen Horowitz, one of the venture firms that have  invested in Box, describes Levie as a “glow-in-the-dark”  entrepreneur. “He’s unmistakable,” Weiss says. “You talk with him  for five minutes, and he says something funny and something smart  and something insightful. He’s a larger-than-life character.”', '  He’s also only 28. Levie stands a little under 6 feet tall and  has a slim, wiry frame. His hair sprouts in a graying forest  above his forehead. His eyes, deep-set and bluish-gray, are each  covered by a thin wisp of a brow. Like a lot of young tech  entrepreneurs, he has a uniform; his is a slim-cut J. Crew suit,  a pressed button-down shirt, and red sneakers.', '  Levie’s routine over the past several years has been stringent.  He wakes at around 10. He showers quickly, and arrives at the  office by 11 a.m. He downs two coffees, sometimes holding two  cups at once. He rarely eats breakfast or, for that matter,  lunch. He spends 90 percent of his daylight hours in meetings or  interviews, to which he walks very quickly or even runs. He is  almost never at his desk. At around 7:30 p.m., he takes a nap for  about an hour, and when he wakes up, he gets really, really  productive. Each night, he probably sends a couple of hundred  emails, and by 2 a.m. or 3 a.m., he’s finally done. Levie  does not take weekends off, and, in the last handful of years, he  has taken one vacation, a three-day trip to Mexico with his  girlfriend.', '  (Read more: A toy  start-up rebels against pink and princesses)', '  For all his decisiveness, he is a somewhat uneasy man --  self-deprecating, certainly less cocksure than your average  28-year-old centimillionaire -- and as he talks about Box’s  competitors in a crowded market, I begin to understand why he  drives himself so hard.', '  “My hair’s gotten grayer,” says Levie. “I was gray before Obama  was.”', '  Box’s daily battles are with Accellion, Citrix, Huddle, Google,  Hightail, IBM, and Oracle -- and the biggest of them, Microsoft.  Microsoft’s SharePoint collaboration tool is a behemoth that  generates nearly $2 billion in revenue from 65,000 companies,  which manage a total of 125 million SharePoint licenses.', '  SharePoint was built in 2001 and was originally focused on  sharing files within a company’s intranet system. Microsoft has  made efforts to keep the platform up to date, but there is a  broad sense that it is falling behind. As a Forrester report put  it recently, SharePoint is experiencing its “awkward teenage  years.” The report went on to note that SharePoint’s “uninspired  user experiences mean that business management isn’t satisfied.”   ', '  At Box, the user experience trumps all. Levie’s big insight, in  2010, was that successful enterprise platforms of the future  would be driven by mobility and design -- the ethos that has  propelled the consumerization of IT. Consumerization means people  are rejecting clunky business-specific hardware even for work  purposes; they insist on cool consumer devices.', '  (Read more: The dotcom  bubble all over again?)', '  This had been talked about for years, but it really hit an  inflection point in 2011, when smartphone shipments outpaced PC  shipments for the first time in history. Then, tablet sales began  to explode. The research company IDC predicts that in 2013, for  the first time, more tablets will be shipped than laptops. The  effect of this proliferation of mobile hardware has been a shift  in expectations around the software that runs on them.', '  “People aren’t going to put up with crappy software anymore,”  says Ben Haines, the chief information officer of Box. “You have  to have a fast, good user experience. And people expect to have  their information everywhere. If you’re building an application  that takes four weeks of training, you’re doing something wrong.”', '  If you’ve ever used an old-school collaboration tool like  SharePoint, using Box is a pleasure by comparison. Let’s say you  have a large document you’d like to share with colleagues. It  could be a Word document, an Excel spreadsheet, or even a large  movie file. You log in to Box and quickly upload the file,  tagging it with any relevant information. Other users within your  Box network can then log in to their own accounts, download the  file, or share it with others as they please. The Box platform  also integrates with other enterprise software providers  (including Salesforce, NetSuite, Zen-Desk, and others), which  means you never really have to click off screen. The site is  designed with light-blue accents and a news feed; until recently,  it had a Like button--it’s a bit like using a work version of  Facebook.', '  And, as with Facebook, many of Box’s early users were driven to  the platform because their friends or colleagues were using it.  It had a viral network effect because it was different, better.  Using Box makes sending files easier and makes collaborating with  co-workers faster. In some small way, it makes work more fun.', '  “Tip: Take the stodgiest, oldest, slowest moving industry you can  find,” Levie recently tweeted. “And build amazing software for  it.”', '  Over the past few years, employees disenchanted with SharePoint’s  stodgy user interface or simply frustrated by the difficulty in  sending large files over email began migrating to Box. It was  easy enough to do: Box is free to the basic user. And as users  signed up in droves, IT managers -- who wanted a better way to  secure the sensitive company files being trafficked through Box  -- began to take notice and started buying up Box “seats,” the  industry term for subscriptions.', '  It was a Trojan horse strategy -- sneak inside the enterprise and  then expand from within. Today, Box’s revenue growth comes  through viral adoption within its enterprise customers -- at each  renewal cycle, IT managers are adding more and more seats. For  businesses, the service costs $15 per month per seat, while  enterprise customers pay around $35 per seat.', '  This story represents a powerful lesson to entrepreneurs entering  the enterprise software business: Build something employees  aren’t told to use but something they want to use. Levie didn’t  start off by selling to IT department buyers; he started off by  creating a great, free product that would attract early adopters.  Once these employees got hooked, they wanted more, and IT buyers  were forced to purchase. Today, Box has a sales team of more than 300 people,  responding to inbound sales calls from around the world.', '  On the second floor of Box headquarters, the company has set up  what it calls the Genius Bar/IT Desk, an area in which about a  dozen mobile devices, ranging from Android smartphones to Apple  tablets, sit on wooden stands.', '  In 2010, when Apple unveiled the iPad, most of Box’s largest  competitors seemed to treat the tablet as if it were a peripheral  device that most people would just use in their personal lives--a  consumer play. Some tech bloggers were enthusiastic, but the more  mainstream audience seemed to fail to grasp the oncoming  significance of tablets. Stephen Elop, then the president of  Microsoft’s business division, said in an April 2010 interview  that the company planned to take a “wait and see” strategy to  launching any software for the iPad. Not surprisingly, IT  departments, which tend to take their cues from Microsoft,  followed suit.', '  (Read more: The top 25 hottest start-ups in the world)', '  “When the iPad first came out, the initial reaction of IT was  like, ‘We don’t support that,’ ” says Josh Stein, a managing  director at the VC firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson. “But end users  said, ‘Well, tough. We’re going to use these. I want to use my  iPad for work, and I’m going to use it whether you let me or  not.’ ”', '  Levie was way ahead of the curve. In January 2010, when Steve  Jobs stood onstage and announced the iPad, Levie knew this tablet  would change everything. (“I commit to spending 10% of my annual  income on ipads,” he joked on Twitter.) In the winter of 2010,  Levie called his developers into a conference room and ordered  them to have a Box iPad app ready as soon as the tablet became  available in stores.', '  “Aaron just walked into the board meeting and said, ‘We’re  betting the company on this thing,’ ” Stein says. “And it was a  great bet.”', '  On March 24, 2010 -- a week before the iPad was released and two  months after he first ordered his developers to create the Box  iPad app, Levie took to Twitter again.', '  “I’ve just seen the future... and there’s no longer any paper in  it. #boxipadapp.”', '  Technically speaking, building a mobile platform on which to send  company files isn’t all that challenging. The real difficulty is  proving that the information will be secure. The idea of being  able to share any file with anyone at any time is alluring, but  it also introduces a massive security risk, especially for  businesses dealing with sensitive customer information such as  credit card numbers and health care records. Among IT  professionals and their employers, there is tremendous unease.  Levie saw that as an opportunity.', '  “The idea is, ‘How do we make Box become the enabler for them to  be able to move to the cloud--the solution for their security in  the cloud,’ ” Levie says. “So not that it’s a check box that  allows them to adopt Box; it’s actually the reason they put  documents in the cloud.”', '  The promise of superior security is why the start-up drchrono  became a partner of Box. Drchrono provides a medical platform for  doctors and patients. At a recent health-tech conference in  Silicon Valley, drchrono’s co-founder and chief operating  officer, Daniel Kivatinos, demonstrated how doctors use the  drchrono iPad app to quickly pull up a patient’s medical history,  along with any relevant images, such as sonograms or chest  X-rays. The company isn’t pulling any of that data from its own  servers--it uses Box as the back-end content-management system to  secure its files.  ', '  Box is able to provide this service to companies like drchrono  because, as of April 2013, Box was certified as Health Insurance  Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, compliant, the  industry standard for protecting electronic health records.  Getting HIPAA certification is the official way to assure  patients a provider is taking all the right steps to protect  their medical information online. But becoming HIPAA compliant is  a notoriously lengthy and expensive process. (SharePoint is HIPAA  compliant; some other Box competitors are not.) HIPAA compliance  is proving valuable: In 2013, Box’s sales in the health care  industry grew more than 81 percent.', '  Today, about 30,000 third-party developers use Box’s application  programming interface, or API, a set of functions that allows a  third-party company to access Box’s internal data and to layer  its information onto Box’s servers. Box is recording about 700  million API calls per month from third-party developers--a  measure of how often users are pulling information from Box on an  app.', '  Nonetheless, fears about data breaches are a drag on Box’s  growth. Enterprise companies are not yet convinced that putting  sensitive company documents into the cloud, let alone on the  servers of an eight-year-old start-up, is worth the risk. Many of  the companies that use Box -- especially Fortune 500 companies --  have not fully integrated their systems within Box’s servers.  They use the platform to upload and share files, but that doesn’t  mean their employees are allowed to post and share just any  company documents.', '  “The market is not mature yet,” says the analyst and writer  Krishnan Subramanian. Because of these fears, Subramanian  believes Box’s $1.2 billion valuation might be a bit exaggerated.  He puts it at closer to $1 billion. It’s not just Box or even  cloud content-management services that face concerns about  security, either. It’s the entire software-as-a-service industry.', '  Levie knows this, and when you spend enough time around him, you  begin to notice something peculiar. Despite Box’s meteoric  growth, and despite the company’s valuation, and despite the fact  that Levie himself is worth north of $100 million, he genuinely  seems to view himself as the underdog, and not merely in the  marketplace. It’s more a cosmic, even philosophical view of  himself.', '  One of Levie’s favorite writers, Malcolm Gladwell -- whom Levie  recently brought in to speak at a customer conference -- once  said that underdogs are “capable of things the rest of us can’t  do [because] they look at things in different ways.” In his most  recent book, David and Goliath, Gladwell asks, “And what does it  take to be that person who doesn’t accept the conventional order  of things as a given...?” ', '  When Levie first announced that he was building an enterprise  software company for the modern age, he was 23. He had no idea  what the conventions of the game were. He had never used any of  the software he hoped to disrupt. But to Gladwell’s point, not  knowing the conventions--or simply refusing to acknowledge  them--appears to have become Levie’s best asset. And the fact  that he feels the odds are against him and against Box--that  isn’t a reason to stop; it’s a reason to continue.', '  “We are the forefront of a really transformative industry,” Levie  told his group of new recruits. “So make sure you’re working as  hard as possible to make sure we win.”', '  “And that’s mostly,” he said, “my last word.”']"

For example, under Colors, you  can fine-tune the saturation, contrast and cast.', ' But maybe a little too easy for some', '  While Photos offers some advanced settings like white balance and  level, it lacks some of the professional-level tools found in  Aperture. For example, it doesn’t have brushable or curve  adjustments and doesn’t support splitting and merging libraries.  And you can’t add custom metadata fields in the app.', '  While Apple believes that Photos will offer enough to satisfy  many current Aperture users and pros, the company said it also  understands that others might opt for a more powerful editing  program like Adobe Lightroom.', 'Read More  Apple earnings blowout may only be the beginning: Analysts', ' Getting in sync', '  One of the main features that Apple is touting in Photos is the  iCloud Photo Library.

Changes I made  to a photo on the desktop app showed up in the iOS Photos library  within seconds over Wi-Fi, and vice versa.', '  Photos and videos are stored in original format to your iPhone  Cloud Library, and can be accessed anytime over Wi-Fi. For those  who are not comfortable with storing their photos in the cloud,  the feature is optional.

For example, I wasn’t  able to test the transfer process from iPhoto and Aperture to  Photos. ', '  Apple said that files from iPhoto and Aperture should migrate  over to Photos intact, but I’d like to see that for my own eyes,  especially after some found the transition from iPhotos to Photos  in iOS 8 to be messy.', '  Also, while the pre-installed software ran smoothly on the  MacBook Pro that Apple loaned me, how will it perform on older  devices?', '  These are areas we’ll look at when the final version of the app  is released.

16,Presidents have less power over the economy than you think,2017-01-17T16:54:36+0000,"['  Presidential reputations rise or fall with gross domestic  product. The state of the economy can determine if presidents are  re-elected, and it shapes historical memory of their success or  failure.', '  In the news media, we often use the handover of power  as the time for assessing the economic  record of the departing president. (I’ve done it myself recently.) Some economists  have predicted that the Trump administration could create the  next recession or financial crisis. And  scholars have studied the relative economic conditions generated  by Republicans and Democrats for predictive meaning (Democrats  have done better since World War II, they found).', '  But the reality is that presidents have far less control over the  economy than you might imagine. Presidential economic records are  highly dependent on the dumb luck of where the nation is in the  economic cycle. And the White House has no control over the  demographic and technological forces that influence the economy.', '  More from New York Times: The Major Potential Impact of a Corporate Tax OverhaulWhy MostEconomists Are So Worried About Trump Making AmericaGreat Again Isn’t Just About Money and Power', '  Even in areas where the president really does have power to shape  the economy — appointing Federal Reserve governors, steering  fiscal and regulatory policy, responding to crises and external  shocks — the relationship between presidential action and  economic outcome is often uncertain and hard to prove.', '  It’s this quirk in how we think that unfairly enhances the  reputation of Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton while unfairly  diminishing the presidencies of Jimmy Carter and both George  Bushes.', '  And if you think of the financial markets as the hyperactive  cousin of the economy itself, this mental framework can cost you  money.', '  We all have a tendency to think that a president whose policies  we disagree with will be bad for the economy and the stock  market. But looking at markets in such starkly political terms  can lead to bad decisions. Ask a conservative who refused to  invest in stocks while they notched a 182 percent gain during the  Obama presidency — or a liberal who shorted stocks after  Donald J. Trump won in November.', '  So what tools does a president actually have to shape economic  outcomes? Fewer than you might think. Let’s walk through the  factors that determine economic results — from those that  are more purely luck to those that do reflect a president’s skill  at overseeing the economy.', '  When George H.W. Bush took office in January 1989, the  unemployment rate was 5.4 percent and the roaring 1980s expansion  was near its peak. When Bill Clinton succeeded him in January  1993, the unemployment rate was 7.3 percent and falling, as the  United States was finally shaking off the damage of a recession.', '  That bit of timing alone — taking office at the trough of  the business cycle versus the peak — can help explain much  of how we perceive a president. Mr. Bush, of course, was a  one-term president, while Mr. Clinton was handily re-elected.', '  President Obama’s luck on this front was somewhere between those  extremes; he took office in the middle of a steep downturn. But  some simple math shows just how much the timing of the 2008-9  recession relative to Inauguration Day mattered. Mr. Obama is set  to leave office with cumulative job growth of 8.4 percent over  his eight years in office.', '  But if he had taken office 13 months earlier in December 2007, he  would have presided over a putrid 3.4 percent growth. If he had  taken office in February 2010, when employment hit rock bottom,  he would be on track to see blockbuster 14 percent job growth in  eight years (assuming 2017 job creation turns out to be  equivalent to 2016).', '  Put simply, when you take office at the bottom of a recession and  with unemployment high, you can “achieve” a lot of growth just  from the natural healing of the economy. When you take office at  the top, there is nowhere to go but down. This may presage bad  news for Mr. Trump, given that the jobless rate was a relatively  low 4.7 percent in December.', '  Consider one of the big economic forces of the post-World War II  economy: women entering the labor force on a mass scale. In 1948,  only 33 percent of American women between 25 and 54 worked or  sought work. By the time George W. Bush took office in January  2001, that had risen to about 77 percent.', '  That means that throughout the second half of the 20th century,  the economy had a huge tailwind, as millions of women joined the  work force and stated contributing to G.D.P. Richard Nixon,  Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton didn’t create that trend; broader  social forces did. But the fact that it happened made their  economic records look better.', '  Expand the idea to other elements of demographics: the baby boom  generation entering the labor force from the 1960s through the  1980s and now retiring; the large millennial generation coming  into the work force. You see that a big part of the economic  growth that might take place during a given presidency is  determined by forces not under any politician’s control.', '  It’s worth noting that these forces are part of the story behind  slow growth during the Obama administration and will —  unless something surprising changes — continue in the Trump  administration. The labor force has grown an average of 0.4  percent a year during the last eight years, and the Congressional  Budget Office projects an average of 0.5 percent a year during  the coming four.', '  By contrast, the labor force grew by an average of 1.2 percent a  year during the 1990s, the last period of blockbuster growth.', '  Now we’re getting to areas where the president really does have  some control over the economic cycle. Too bad it’s so indirect.', '  The Federal Reserve raises and lowers interest rates in an effort  to prevent recessions and maintain low inflation. The president  appoints its seven-member board of governors, including the  chair.', '  The president can select appointees who align in terms of  philosophy and instincts, and may select Fed governors who are  more competent — or less. But the Fed system is designed to  maintain independence from the administration once the  appointments are made.', '  Beyond that, terms are staggered such that a president won’t  necessarily get to appoint a majority of Fed leaders, especially  right off the bat (Fed governors’ terms are 14 years, though  lately few have served that long; the Fed chair has a four-year  term).', '  So when a president appoints Fed officials who are effective  stewards of monetary policy, achieving their goals of maximum  employment, stable prices and financial stability, it helps a  president’s odds of having an impressive economic record. It just  isn’t a very direct exertion of power.', '  This is often what we think of when we talk about a president’s  economic policy. The occupants of the Oval Office can steer  policy around taxing and spending priorities. But they can’t do  it alone.', '  It’s certainly true that tax and spending policy carries a  president’s imprint. President Obama’s election victories enabled  him to enact a major fiscal stimulus in 2009 and increase taxes  on the wealthy starting in 2013. President Reagan’s election  brought a sharp cut in tax rates. Different election results  would have made for different fiscal policy.', '  But Congress has, if anything, greater power than the president  over how the government taxes and spends. It’s almost a punch  line that when a president issues a proposed budget each winter,  congressional opponents call it “dead on arrival.”', '  And while Mr. Obama had fiscal policy wins, he also met stiff  resistance. The spending cuts known as “sequestration” happened  because Republicans took control of Congress in 2010.', '  So to the degree that taxes and spending shape the course of the  economy — and there’s no doubt they do — presidents can  set direction, but not steer the ship themselves. It is a lesson  Mr. Trump will soon learn.', '  There’s a broad range of other areas in which presidential action  affects the economic future. Name a field, and the president  exerts power over it: health care, energy, technology innovation,  financial regulation, labor policies, trade, transportation  infrastructure, agricultural policy. The list is endless. Even  foreign policy matters; stable geopolitics is generally good for  business.', '  The problem is that all of these big policy areas affect the  nation’s economic prospects over the long run. The downsides of  regulating banks poorly might show up as a crisis a decade down  the road. The benefits of better infrastructure will tend to show  up over many years. The payoffs of well-designed education  policies come to fruition as young people enter the labor market  with better skills years later.', '  Likewise, from a more conservative vantage point, the cost of  environmental restrictions limiting energy production may not  show up in the price of fuel for years. Burdensome, outdated  regulations tend to show up as a modest drag on business year  after year, not as an acute, clear crisis.', '  For example, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the  Affordable Care Act would reduce the labor supply by 2.3 million  because more people would choose not to work. (The thinking being  that they were working mainly so they could have  employee-sponsored health insurance.) It said this would happen  not immediately, but by 2021, a full 11 years after the law was  passed and four years after the president who signed it would be  out of office.', '  And that’s a case where independent economists manage to create  an estimate of economic consequences. Often these economic  impacts are so slow-building, diffuse and subject to partisan  interpretation that it’s hard to estimate them with any  precision. We all want to assume that it is our preferred  policies that make the economy rev more strongly, even if it’s  hard to prove definitively.', '  None of this means that presidents can’t do a lot to make the  United States economy more dynamic and productive. It’s just that  doing so could take a great while. It’s hard to prove that this  or that policy was the source of the good times.', '  In the short run, all those other factors have a more direct,  measurable effect in shaping whether a moment in political  history produces an economy we remember fondly.']"

In its 2017  outlook, Charles Schwab pulled inflation to its “front burner”  list of concerns for stocks and pushed deflation to its “back  burner.” Others feel the same.', '  “In the second half of the year, we think there’s going to be  some headwinds in the market with people worrying about wage  inflation in 2018, and the Fed being behind the curve. It’s not  necessarily that they’re going to be realities, but I think at  the end of the year, people are going to be worried about  inflationary pressures, largely coming from wages,” said Scott  Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment  Institute. ', 'Steven Wieting, global chief strategist at Citi Private Bank,  expects President-elect Donald Trump’s plans for fiscal stimulus  and tax cuts to boost GDP by more than a full percent this year.  But those programs should also bring some inflation.', '  “While they may succeed in postponing the timing of the next  cyclical downturn in the U.S. and world economy, this could come  at a cost of a more severe downturn later on. One major risk of  fiscal stimulus so late into an economic cycle is inflation,”  Wieting wrote in his 2017 outlook. ', 'Just like anything, too much inflation would not be good. But the lack of it has been a concern, and after years of little price traction, strategists see it picking up to a still comfortable pace.', '  “I don’t think inflation is going to be a crushing inflation,”  said Wieting in an interview. “But consumers in the United States  don’t get wage adjustments for inflation.”', '  Service sector prices could be the biggest driver of inflation  because that is the most labor intensive part of the economy,  said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont. ', '“I  think we could see headline inflation by the end of this year  running the high 2s and the core could be well over 2 percent as  well,” said Stanley. He expects wage growth of about 3 percent by the end of next year.', '“If the Trump administration is able to  successfully shepherd through a lot of things they are advocating  that would be positive for growth. You could see a boost to  growth without it being terribly inflationary ... I’m more hawkish on inflation than most. It’s not because of the fiscal  side, it’s because I think the Fed has already fallen behind  the curve,” Stanley said.  ', 'That inflation target is even before considering potential effects from  the still-unknown variables likely to be generated by Trump’s planned trade policies. Wieting  does not expect to see protectionist moves from the Trump  administration but he said trade is the biggest risk to his  forecast. ', 'He and others expect the Fed to raise interest rates faster if  inflation moves up too quickly. For now, it is still sluggish  — under the 2 percent targeted by the U.S. central bank, for a fifth year  now. ', '  The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the personal  consumption expenditure price index, showed core inflation at  just 1.6 percent in November. Less than half of Fed officials expect inflation to reach 1.9 to 2 percent this year,  and the rest have a lower forecast.', '  But many economists have been forecasting that inflation could finally  break above the Fed’s 2 percent target in 2017. Jefferies  economists say inflation is accelerating primarily because  commodities prices are again rising and commodities-based goods  prices are going higher. They expect consumer price index  inflation to surpass the central bank’s 2 percent target in the first  quarter and approach 3 percent by the end of the year. They see  PCE at about 2.5 percent at year-end. ', '  Schwab strategists said the return of inflation could help to  lift sales for global companies and boost business confidence and  spending. A rising dollar could keep inflation in check, they  said, and as long as it does not rise too much, stock valuations seem  reasonable. They expect the Fed to raise rates twice this year as  inflation picks up.', '  Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays, actually  included in his inflation forecast what many economists have left  as unknowns — the potential impact of tariffs on inflation.  So far, it’s unclear what Trump will do about taxing goods at the  border, but the president-elect has said companies that go  overseas to manufacture should pay an expensive tax on goods  shipped back into the U.S.', '  On Thursday, Toyota was the latest company to be warned by Trump  on Twitter to build cars in the U.S., not Mexico or pay a huge  tax.', '', '  “In our outlook for this year, we did assume that the Trump  administration applies tariffs to both Mexico and China.Some of our  improvement in inflation, firming in inflation in our forecast  for 2017 is a result of imposition of trade restricting policies.  Even aside from that, there’s good reason to expect inflation  would continue to firm. It would come from different sources,”  said Gapen. He said he expects inflation this year to come  domestically from increases in wages, services sector prices and  higher shelter costs.', '  Congress has also separately suggested a border  tax, which would act similar to a valued-added tax. The  tax could be 15 to 20 percent depending on what level the  corporate tax rate is cut to, from its current 35 percent.', '  The border-adjusted tax would tax all incoming goods and  services, but not exports out of the U.S. It’s unclear what will  happen with the proposal, but congressional leaders have said  it’s an important part of the corporate tax overhaul. ', '  Gapen estimates 2.4 percent for core PCE inflation by the fourth  quarter of the year, and 2.3 percent on headline. Of that, 0.2  percent is due to his estimates of a 7 percent tariff on Mexican  goods and a 15 percent tariff on Chinese imports. But if there is  a border tax, he said the inflation hit could be much greater and  difficult to forecast.', '  Gapen said the inflationary impact of the increase in oil prices  should be greatest in the first quarter since crude bottomed last  February. ', '  Proponents of the border tax expect a rising dollar to offset the  impact of higher costs of goods to consumers. But critics are  doubtful the dollar would rise enough to offset it.', '  In the minutes of its last meeting released Wednesday,  the Fed noted that  it expects fiscal stimulus but the impact on the economy is  unclear. However, many central bank officials said there could be  an upside risk to their forecasts. But they also noted it could  potentially be inflationary or cause the dollar to rise.']"

22,iPhone 7 Review,2016-09-13T10:40:06+0000,"['  The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are deeply unusual devices. They are full  of aggressive breaks from convention while wrapped in cases that  look almost exactly like their two direct predecessors. Even that  continuity of design is a break from convention; after almost a  decade of Apple’s  steady two-year iPhone update pattern, merely retaining the same  design for a third straight year plays against expectations.', '  Inside that case, everything else about the iPhone 7 is a  decisive statement about the future. The dual cameras on the  iPhone 7 Plus promise to usher in a new era in mobile  photography. The iconic iPhone home button is no longer a  physical button, but instead a sophisticated ballet of pressure  sensors and haptic vibration motors that simulate the feel of a  button. The new A10 Fusion processor blends two high-power cores  that rival laptop performance with two low-power cores that  combine with a much larger battery to extend run time by up to  two hours.', ' More from The Verge:Mossberg: Choosing the iPhone 7 is tougher than in the  pastSony’s biggest ever PlayStation 4 update is out  nowLookat this limited edition Final Fantasy XV slim PS4', '  And, yes, Apple has removed the headphone jack.', '  Removing the headphone jack is an act of pure confidence from  Apple, which is the only company in tech that can set off a sea  changes in the industry by aggressively dropping various  technologies from its products. Floppy drives, optical drives,  its own proprietary 30-pin iPod connector, flash, even USB —  Apple decides that it’s time to move on, and it has a massive  installed base of customers that love and trust the company who  make it happen. And now it’s decided that — yikes — the  headphone jack is over.', '  After using the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus for about a week, it’s clear  to me that Apple has forceful, but considered opinions about how  the next generation of phones should fit into our lives. But it’s  also clear that the iPhone 7 is a transitional step to that  vision of the future, not a complete expression of it. The  question for would-be upgraders is simple: is all of the latent  promise in this phone worth the inconvenience of that transition?', ' There’s really no getting around it: the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus  look more or less exactly like the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus from 2014.  They are now water resistant, which is nice, although they’re not  fully waterproof— keep them submerged  in a meter of water for more than 30 minutes and things might not  go your way. Samsung’s Galaxy S7 and Note 7 are technically even  more water resistant, but I think it’s basically a push —  you can get these phones casually wet now without catastrophe,  and that’s a big win. If you want to go snorkeling with your  iPhone, you should probably get a case anyhow.', '  Apart from the water resistance, there are three main external  differences between the 6 and 7: first, the antenna lines on the  back have been tweaked and colored to blend into the body on the  matte black and glossy jet black models, which is a welcome  refinement. (The antennas remain a dull gray color on the silver,  gold, and rose gold variants; Apple says there are limits on what  colors can be applied.) Second, the camera bump has been enlarged  and more artfully curved into the rear casing, which looks  particularly handsome on the smaller phone with a single camera.', '  And third — here it is again — there’s no headphone  jack.', '  But really, once you put the iPhone 7 in a case, it looks exactly  like an iPhone 6. And if you get a jet black model, you’ll want  to get it into a case immediately — my jet black review unit  scratched and scuffed almost instantly, and the only time it’s  remained fingerprint-free is when we literally handled it with  white gloves for the photo and video shoots accompanying this  review. Apple is being unusually open about the propensity of the  jet black finish to scratch, but beyond that, I’d get the matte  black anyway — it just looks meaner.', ' The iPhone 6 has always been one of the more utilitarian  designs in Apple history, and a smoothed-out camera bump and less  visible antennas don’t really change that. Apple’s competition  is getting  better at making beautiful phones, and nothing about  the iPhone 7′s design exceeds the rest of the industry. The  iPhone 7 Plus in particular is actually falling behind its  large-screened competition; the 6 Plus was always a bit of a  surfboard, and new devices like the Galaxy Note 7 fit enormous  displays into much smaller, tighter packages. (Too bad  about the  explosions, though.) This is still a phone that looks  best in a case.', '  The iPhone 7′s new home button will elicit instant reaction  from people; it’s much more different than you might think. The  button no longer moves at all — it’s totally solid, just  like newer MacBook trackpads. A linear vibration unit that Apple  calls the Taptic Engine jolts when you apply pressure to the  button, tricking your brain into feeling a click. It’s nothing  like the clumsy haptic feedback on other phones, which I’ve  always disliked — it really does feel like a click.', '  This system works tremendously well on MacBooks, but on the  iPhone 7 it feels like the entire bottom of the phone is  clicking, not like you’re pushing a button. You can set the  haptic feedback to one of three force settings that make it feel  like a harder or stronger click, but it’s definitely still  strange, especially if the phone is lying down on a table instead  of in your hand and you can see that you’re just pushing against  nothing.', '  I’m sort of okay with all this, but other people who’ve tried my  review units really don’t like it. There’s something about a  really great button, and the iPhone home button was an all-time  great button. Apple says it switched up the home button to make  it more customizable and more durable — there’s a lot of  people with the software button floating around their iPhone  screens — but it’ll take some adjustment to really get used  to. You’ll have to try it to decide for yourself.', '  The Taptic Engine also adds all sorts of other fun feedback to  iOS 10 — when you drop the notification shade down, the  phone does a little bump, for example. It makes it feel like the  software on the screen has real weight and inertia, and I love  it. Third-party apps can use the Taptic Engine as well, and I’m  really hoping the industry adds support faster than the slow,  somewhat muted rollout of not-very-useful  3D Touch support. Taptic Engine feedback is the first really  valuable new UI concept I’ve seen on phones in years, while 3D  Touch always seemed like more of a gimmick. It’s strange that the  iPhone 6S won’t get these features even though it has a Taptic  Engine; Apple says the unit in the iPhone 7 has been revised and  made more precise, but it’s still an odd omission.', '  3D Touch is still present on the iPhone 7′s display, and the  display itself is improved. It’s not as insane as the 2K and 4K  OLED panels that have been popping up on Android phones, but it’s  a sharp, bright, and beautiful LCD, and sharp, bright, beautiful  LCDs are very nice to look at. My review unit is also noticeably  warmer than the iPhone 6S display, which I’ve come to appreciate.', '  You won’t notice it in most apps, but the display can show a  wider range of colors now, which is really obvious when you look  at photos taken by the iPhone 7′s camera — which now also  captures a wider range of colors. Photos taken by the iPhone 7  look ridiculously good on the iPhone 7 display; you can tell the  difference between a 7 photo and a 6S photo on the 7′s screen  almost instantly. That’s the only place you’ll really see the  benefit of the new screen for now, but it’s another place where  app developers can really take advantage of powerful new  hardware. Instagram has already announced an update to support  wide color; let’s hope others follow suit.', '  Apart from the revised camera, the new home button, the screen,  and — heyo! — the headphone jack, the other notable  external hardware change to the iPhone 7 is the addition of  stereo speakers. One speaker is at the bottom of the phone, as it  has been, and the other is actually integrated into the earpiece.  They’re much louder than before, and sound decent, with better  treble performance in particular. They’re never going to replace  real speakers, but you can watch a bunch of YouTube videos or  Snapchats and not get annoyed, and conference calls are  dramatically improved.', '  Okay, I’ve made you wait long enough. Let’s talk about that  headphone jack, shall we?', '  So there’s no headphone jack on the iPhone 7. Apple says it  needed to take out the headphone jack so it could make space for  better cameras, the Taptic Engine (even though the 6S also had a  Taptic Engine), and perhaps most importantly, a bigger battery.  It was also easier to make a phone with one less hole in it water  resistant, but Apple tells me that it wasn’t a huge  factor.', '  Apple ships a pair of its EarPods headphones with a Lightning  connector in the box, as well as a Lightning-to-3.5mm dongle so  you can use your traditional headphones. You’re not totally out  of luck if you have a big investment in corded headphones, but  you’re going to want to stock up on those adapters if you  regularly plug your phone into a car or have a variety of  headphones you like to use — the dongle is small enough that  it’s not obtrusive, but also small enough so that it’s destined  to get lost if you move it around a lot. At $9, the headphone  dongle is the cheapest Apple hardware you can buy; the company  thinks people will just buy a few and keep them permanently  attached to older headphones. And I’m sure third parties will  come up with a million other options, although it’ll be hard to  beat $9.', '  The Lightning EarPods are exactly like Apple’s regular EarPods,  which is to say that they sound average-to-bad and fit either  fine or not-great depending on your ears. Competitors like LG and  HTC ship much higher quality headphones with their flagship  phones, and Apple owns Beats, so it’s just really hard to  understand why it’s still shipping such decidedly mediocre  headphones with the iPhone. Especially when the company is trying  to get everyone to be enthusiastic about the move away from  3.5mm. But here we are.', '  Of course, the real move Apple’s trying to make is to wireless  audio, and the company also gave me a preproduction set of its  AirPods wireless earbuds to try out. I can’t fully review them  here since they’re not final, but they worked well — they’re  basically Bluetooth headphones that pair easier and faster with  Apple’s products because of a proprietary controller chip called  the W1 and special software built into iOS, macOS, and watchOS.  Once you pair the AirPods with one Apple device, they can  seamlessly switch to all the others, which is very cool. But  AirPods sound just like EarPods because they’re basically EarPods  without wires, so what you’re getting for your $159 is  convenience and early adopter status, not necessarily sound  quality.', '  I asked Apple if Dr. Dre or Jimmy Iovine consulted on the sound  or design of the AirPods and there was a lot of demurring. I  don’t know why Beats is putting out new wireless headphones that  have the W1 chip in them and Apple is putting out AirPods that  sound just like EarPods when there’s such obvious corporate  collaboration opportunity there, but two of the three new Beats  models charge via Micro USB and one charges via Lightning, so  searching for order in this universe remains an entirely futile  exercise.', '  More importantly, it’s disappointing that Apple didn’t put more  work into making wireless audio a better overall experience on  the iPhone 7. The company’s own new W1 headphones get the fancy  new pairing support, but other Bluetooth headphones and speakers  still use the same somewhat flaky Bluetooth setup interface as  before. And AirPlay feels all but abandoned; it was already  getting less and less competitive over time, and the iPhone 7 and  iOS 10 don’t seem to offer any noticeable improvements.', '  I’ve been spending some serious time really thinking about when  and where I use the headphone jack, and it turns out that I  already do much of my music listening wirelessly: Bluetooth in  the car, an Amazon Echo, a few Sonos speakers, a couple Bluetooth  speakers here and there. This is about as messy and unintuitive  as it gets, but it’s not too far off the mainstream. I could buy  a nice set of Bluetooth headphones that also support corded audio  for watching movies on planes and basically be covered, but I  won’t get any of Apple’s improvements to the wireless experience  unless I buy a Beats Solo3 with the W1 in it.', '  That is the definition of ecosystem lock-in, and it’s incredibly  frustrating.', '  Apple took away an established open standard in favor of new  technologies, but instead of making the experience of using those  new technologies better across the board, it made every  third-party wireless audio product a second-class citizen of the  Apple ecosystem. If Apple is serious about wireless audio, it’s  going to have to allow other companies to use the newer, better  Bluetooth support in iOS that enhances its own W1 products, and  it’s going to have to make managing Bluetooth devices a lot nicer  than it currently is.', '  And if Apple is really serious about wireless  audio, it will allow third parties to extend the AirPlay  interface just like it allows third parties to extend Siri and  iMessage; an iPhone without a headphone jack needs to have  dead-simple integrations with all kinds of wireless speaker  systems, whether they’re from Sonos or Samsung or Amazon. To make  wireless audio happen, Apple has to do the work of opening up and  making the experience of connecting to any audio system on the  iPhone as simple and frustration-free as pushing a button —  as simple as wired audio has always been. Apple says it hasn’t  yet had any serious conversations about opening or extending its  wireless audio interfaces, but that it’s committed to a wireless  world, so let’s hope the company moves quickly.', '  It would also be nice if Apple would put out an adapter that lets  you simultaneously charge your phone and listen to music that  isn’t the size of a VGA dongle, because I have no intention of  letting this  ridiculous Belkin thing anywhere near my bag. There’s a  huge opportunity for third-party accessory makers to fill all the  gaps left by the removal of the headphone jack, but it’s also  clear that the first wave of accessories is going to be a little  clumsy while everyone learns exactly what those gaps are and how  best to fill them. (And if Mophie isn’t working on a battery case  with a headphone jack, customers should start picketing the  company.)', '  If you squint, it’s possible to see a future iPhone that has no  wires at all — an iPhone that does everything wirelessly,  including charging. But the iPhone 7 is not that iPhone. In fact,  right now you need more wires, dongles, and  adapters to  make it work with the rest of your life than ever  before. I love that stuff — it’s part of the thrill of being  an early adopter. But if you don’t want to devote even a moment’s  effort toward figuring out how to do something as simple as  charge your phone and listen to audio at the same time, it might  be worth waiting for things to settle into place.', '  One of my favorite recurring bits at iPhone introductions  is when Phil Schiller notes, correctly, that the iPhone camera is  likely the best camera most people will ever own. He’s been  saying it fairly regularly since the iPhone 4S came out in 2011,  and he said it again last week when he introduced the iPhone 7  camera. This is an incredible fact, as is the fact that a huge  number of people now quietly upgrade to a better camera on a  fairly regular basis, and then use the hell out of that camera.  The explosion in mobile photography is one of the most  revolutionary aspects of the entire smartphone revolution, and  the general excellence of the iPhone camera over time is a big  reason why.', '  The iPhone 7 represents another upgrade over the iPhone 6S:  there’s a new, faster f/1.8 lens, the addition of optical image  stabilization, a new four-color True Tone flash, and wider color  capture. This all adds up to a decent improvement, but the iPhone  6S was already operating at the top of the scale, bested only recently by the latest cameras in  the Galaxy S7 and Note 7. In low light, that faster lens and  optical image stabilization means that the 7 significantly  outperforms the 6S. But compared to the iPhone 6S, the iPhone 7  is a step improvement, not a major leap.', '  The attempt at a major leap is on the iPhone 7 Plus. Instead of a  single lens and sensor, the 7 Plus has two: the same f/1.8 28mm  wide-angle lens as the iPhone 7, and an f/2.8 56mm telephoto  lens. These cameras operate simultaneously; they’re always  working together. Right now, what this means is that you can  switch to a true 2x zoom by tapping on a button, which is very  nice. You can also digitally zoom the 1x lens to 2x, where the  telephoto takes over, and then digitally zoom the 2x lens to 10x.  Digital zoom is still digital zoom; anything past 4x definitely  looks like what you’d expect from grainy digital zoom.', '  And, well, that’s all it really does right now. Zooming is great,  but that’s not the only reason to put dual cameras on a phone.  Other phones with dual cameras, like the Huawei Honor 8, let you  do all kinds of wild focus and depth of field adjustments, and  some even let you refocus the image after the fact, like a Lytro  camera. The effects can be a little fake-looking, but they’re the  sort of thing dual cameras enable. But the iPhone 7 Plus doesn’t  do any of that, although a forthcoming software update will  enable a portrait mode that blurs the background into what looks  like a very nice bokeh.', '  Even that is just scratching the surface of  what can be done with two cameras on a phone with as much  processing power as the iPhone 7 Plus, and I’m really hoping  Apple allows third-party developers to tap into the system and  experiment with possibilities like refocusing and perspective  shifts. But for now, you get zooming. We spent a lot of time  shooting with the 7 Plus, and it gets noticeably warm when you  use the cameras for an extended period; it takes a lot of  processing power to meld those two cameras into a single unit.  I’m very curious to see the impact on heat and battery life when  Apple enables features beyond zooming.', '  Apple has been blowing up iPhone photos to billboard sizes and  crowing about its cameras for years now, so at this point the  opportunity for improvement is fairly small. I took a few photos  with the iPhone 7 Plus and the iPhone 6S Plus under decent light  and asked people to tell them apart on a laptop screen. It was  pretty hard for most everyone, although the 7 definitely has more  vibrant colors and a noticeably shallower depth of field because  of the brighter lens. You can tell if you know what to look for,  but the difference in most shots will be imperceptible in an  Instagram or Facebook feed.', '  Front cameras are almost  more important than rear cameras in our Instagram  Stories world, and the iPhone 7′s front camera is excellent, with  a new 7-megapixel sensor replacing the 5-megapixel unit in the  6S. The lens is not quite as wide angle as Samsung’s cameras, but  it’s bright, sharp, and the Retina Flash is still a terrific idea  that was absolutely worth lifting from Snapchat. It’s a solid  improvement, and a welcome one.', '  We conducted some pretty extensive camera testing against a  Samsung Galaxy Note 7, an iPhone 6S Plus, a Fuji XT10, and a  Canon 5D MkIII — you can see the results for yourself. The  iPhone 7 and 7 Plus clearly hold their own, but I don’t think  they blow the pack away. That might all change when Apple starts  taking more advantage of the dual cameras, but for now, I don’t  think the 7 Plus will keep anyone away from a mirrorless rig.  Which is exactly what I said about the iPhone 6S last year.', '  The iPhone 7 has the new A10 Fusion chip, another product  from Apple’s industry-leading chip design team. It’s a new design  with four cores: two high performance cores, and two low-power  cores that use less battery power during everyday tasks.', '  It’s lightning-fast, of course, with early benchmarks indicating  that the A10 Fusion is faster than even the A9X in the iPad Pro.  But In my super boring day-to-day Twitter / Facebook / Gmail /  Slack / Safari usage, the iPhone 7 Plus wasn’t really all that  much faster than the A9 chip in the iPhone 6S Plus — likely  because I wasn’t pushing the processor enough to use the  high-performance cores. It’s impressive that Apple was able to  create a more efficient processor that delivers the same  perceived performance as the previous generation while using less  power, but that also means that in everyday use I didn’t see  anything like the performance leaps that were so noticeable in  previous iPhone updates.', '  Still, faster is better, and once app developers start targeting  the A10 Fusion, we might see a new wave of apps that harness its  raw power. But that’s a familiar waiting game we’ve been playing  with ever-faster iOS devices for years now.', '  Apple claims that a combination of a larger battery that fills  some of the space formerly used by the headphone jack, the more  efficient processor, and iOS 10 improvements allows the iPhone 7  to run for two more hours than the iPhone 6S, and the 7 Plus to  go for an hour longer than the 6S Plus. That was mostly borne out  in my day-to-day testing, which saw the smaller phone run for  about 10 hours of medium usage and the larger iPhone 7 Plus go  for about 12 hours. Under a heavier load, I get the sense that  battery life will be more like the 6S models, but those extra  hours will be meaningful for those desperate moments on the way  home from work.', '  Speaking of iOS 10, it’s wonderful. Seriously, it’s the  nicest iOS update in a long time, with a clear sense of how you  should flow between operations and a much more inviting visual  design. We’ll have much more about iOS 10 in a forthcoming  review, but know that it has a slick new version of iMessage with  all kinds of new features, a new version of Siri that can be  extended by third-party apps, better integration with smart home  devices, a much-improved Control Center, better Music and News  apps, and a ton of other new features.', '  (As an aside: my personal favorite iOS 10 tweak is that Apple has  gotten rid of slide-to-unlock because the Touch ID sensor on the  6S and 7 is so fast — sliding to the right from the lock  screen now brings you to a widget screen. You unlock the phone  just by pressing the home button, which is enough time for Touch  ID to recognize your fingerprint. Apple’s slide-to-unlock patent  was at the center of many of their lawsuits against Android phone  makers, and I once made an entire  video exploring how Android phones were carefully  designed around that patent. And now it’s gone, because Apple  figured out a better idea that’s genuinely useful.)', 'Down to brass tacks: do all of the new features of the iPhone 7  make up for the inconvenience of the missing headphone jack? This  may or may not surprise you, but I don’t think so — not yet.', '  The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are legitimately among the most  interesting, opinionated, powerful phones Apple has ever shipped,  and the most confident expressions of the company’s vision in a  long time. iOS 10 is excellent, the cameras are better, and the  performance is phenomenal. And the batteries last longer. These  are terrific phones.', '  ut they are also incomplete. The most interesting feature of the  iPhone 7 Plus’ new dual camera isn’t shipping at launch. Apple’s  making a big bet on iMessage and Siri apps in iOS 10 but it  hasn’t paid off yet. Apps haven’t been updated to use the Taptic  Engine or the new wide color gamut display. The  entire ecosystem  of new headphones and adapters required to make use of  Lightning and wireless audio is just getting off the ground. Only  Apple or Beats headphones offer the best wireless audio  experience, and you might not like how they sound or fit. By the  time developers even come close to hitting the performance limits  of the A10 Fusion chip, Apple will be shipping the A11 Fusion Pro  with six blades.', '  The entire time I was using the iPhone 7, I felt like I had a  prototype of next year’s rumored drastic iPhone redesign  disguised as an iPhone 6. All those bold bets on the future are  legitimately exciting, but here in the present using the iPhone 7  in a case feels a lot like using a iPhone 6S with a weirder home  button and more adapters.', '  If you need a new phone right now, sure, buy an iPhone 7. The  little one starts at $649 for a mercifully doubled 32GB of  storage and ranges up to $849 for 256GB, and the Plus starts at  $769 for 32GB and goes up to $969 for 256GB. Make sure you factor  in the extra cost of headphone adapters or Bluetooth headphones,  because you’ll end up needing them. You’ll be fine, and your  photos will be better.', '  But unless you’re eager and ready to live the early adopter life,  you won’t actually be missing out on much if you don’t get an  iPhone 7. This is an iPhone that lays a marker in tech history,  and it will serve as the foundation for many important changes to  how phones work and integrate into our lives. We’re going to  remember the iPhone 7.', '  It’s going to be the next iPhones that  actually build a useful future on that foundation.', 'IPHONE 7 AND 7 PLUS', 'Good Stuff', '  Bad Stuff']"
23,Resistance is futile: Star Trek at 50,2016-09-07T23:43:49+0000,"['  September 8, 1966. It was a good time to be a 10-year-old boy. It  was an especially good time if you were into science fiction.  True, my two favorite shows of all time, “The Twilight Zone” and  “The Outer Limits,” had been cancelled, the former two years  before, the latter just a year before. But “Voyage to the Bottom  of the Sea,” with Richard Basehart piloting a super-submarine of  the distant future (the 1970s!) and “Lost in Space,” a somewhat  silly Robinson Crusoe story about a family marooned in a hostile  universe, were still going strong.', '  There was plenty of sci-fi at the movies as well: “Fantastic  Voyage” had just opened at the Hatboro Theater a couple miles  away. This was one of the great ones, with everything a 10-year-old boy could want:', '  And that first week of September, another new series, “The Time  Tunnel,” was beginning on CBS. That had a promising premise as  well: several men are trapped in time and are switched from one  period to another. Lots of potential for mayhem: wars, volcanoes,  man-made destruction.', '  Sound silly? Some of it was, but it was all undeniably fun, often  scary, and usually engaging, and space opera — even if it  was just westerns transferred to space — was the most fun of  all. ', '  Like many enterprises that became famous, the origins of “Star  Trek” is covered with a lot of mythology. Gene Rodenberry,  a science fiction fan, had worked as a scriptwriter for various  television westerns. In 1964, he worked up a short draft about  the crew of a spaceship that went exploring the galaxy. ', 'He met  with Oscar Katz and Herb Solow, then executives with Desilu  Productions, the TV production company controlled, at the time,  by Lucille Ball. They were not exactly science fiction fans.  Years later, Solow told the BBC that when he originally  approached Lucille Ball to tell her about the “Star Trek” idea,  she thought it would be a series about a group touring a war zone  to entertain the troops. ', 'Despite doubts from her board of executives, Ball  approved the project. NBC picked up the series, but even then did  not air the two original pilots that had been presented to it until after the show was already on the air. ', '  The first episode of “Star Trek” that aired that night, “The Man  Trap,” about a shape-shifting monster, was not one of the best,  but it had all the elements in place:  Kirk, McCoy, Sulu and  Spock. It came long before the “Vulcan nerve pinch” and the  Vulcan salute, “live long and prosper,” which would not appear  until the second season.', '  It was not to last. The ratings were crummy because it had a  lousy time slot of 8:30 p.m. on Friday night. It was picked up for a  third season only after a now-famous write-in from the show’s  small but dedicated fanbase. NBC renewed it, but changed the time to  10 p.m., a killer for younger fans like myself.  ', '  Still, it lasted for three seasons and 79 episodes. That was long  enough to reach the critical threshold, the promised land of all  TV shows: syndication. The original series played for years in  syndication, both in the United States and abroad, and it was in this form that  it became famous. ', '  It became famous even as the world was changing, and science  fiction changed with it. Rod Serling, the now-legendary narrator  of “The Twilight Zone,” reappeared with “Night Gallery” in 1969,  a series that attempted to replicate the feel of “The Twilight  Zone” but only managed to feel sullen without the creativity and  emotional impact of the original. What followed was even drearier  post-apocalyptic fare, movies like “Silent Running” or “Soylent  Green” that would dominate sci-fi through most of the decade.  Your parents as food? Please.', '  Fun had hibernated, but it never went away, and with the coming  of “Star Wars” in 1977, the space opera — once again a  western in space — came back. And it never left.', '  And “Star Trek?” It just got bigger and bigger.  The reruns  — now known as “TOS” or “The Original Series” — kept  playing all over the world. The first “Star Trek” convention was  1972. An animated series ran in the mid-1970s. The first movie,  “Star Trek: The Motion Picture,” was a hit in 1979 and12 more would  come in the next 27 years. The first of four television spinoffs,  “Star Trek: The Next Generation,” ran between 1987 and 1994, with  Patrick Stewart playing a James Kirk type 100 years after the  original series.  A fifth is coming on CBS All Access.', '  In the decades since, the economics of “Star Trek” have been, well,  galactic. The-numbers.com estimates that the “Star Trek” film  franchise has grossed $2.2 billion alone.  In 2005, Forbes  estimated there were 70 million “Star Trek” books in print, with  merchandising worth about $4 billion in lifetime gross. Not bad  if you’re Paramount.', '  Why is “Star Trek” so popular? First, the science is pretty good.  There were plenty of misses — no one is yet being beamed up  anywhere, at least not yet — but the flip cell phone, the  communicator, is very real — although you still can’t  contact starships in orbit. McCoy’s tricorder is very close to  reality. In 2011, the XPrize Foundation launched the Tricorder X  Prize, a $10 million prize to develop a mobile device that could  non-invasively diagnose over a dozen medical conditions.  Finalists have already been announced.', '  Then there was the cultural impact. A multiracial crew. A black  woman, Uhura. A Russian, Chekov. A Japanese-American, Sulu.   And, of course, Spock. What is supposedly the first  interracial kiss on TV, between Kirk and Uhura, in a now-famous  Season 3 episode.', '  But the real reason for its success is that like most great  shows, it was not about its ostensible topic. AMC’s “The Walking  Dead” is not about zombies. It’s about trust and family and,  ultimately, that’s what “Star Trek” was about. It wasn’t about  flying around in space, though the love of exploration was a  central theme. It was about human interaction and the need for  the crew to trust each other in very difficult  circumstances. ', '  They were all different. They often had conflicting motives. They  usually argued. But they all passionately cared about each other.', '  They were a family.  ', '  And Kirk, at the head of the family, could always be counted on  to digress at some critical point in the show to deliver a  pseudo-Shakespearean monologue about the perils of being in  command, or why aliens were people too, or some such  nonsense. ', '  And we loved it.', '  Of course, it all became a little much over time, and the  parodies came very soon after the original show. William Shatner  seemed to recognize the joke very early on. One of the great  kitsch albums of all time, “The Transformed Man,” was a 1968  Shatner album that consisted of readings from “Hamlet” and “King  Henry the Fifth,” but is most remembered for covers of “Mr.  Tambourine Man” and especially “Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds.”    ', '  Listen to these songs if you haven’t, and you will never hear  them the same way again. It’s that disturbing.', '  And that’s part of the problem: people outside don’t take you  seriously when you say you’re a science fiction fan. Trying to  explain why science fiction was so special to someone who thinks  it’s all plastic monsters and boyish stupidity is hopeless. It’s  like trying to explain to someone why the “Three Stooges” were so  funny. You had to be in that mindset, and if you weren’t, it was  useless explaining.', '  Science fiction did grow up, of course. If you need proof, head  to the theaters this fall to see the stunning “Arrival,” about  the oldest of sci-fi tropes — first contact with aliens. It  was a show-stopper at the just-completed Telluride Film Festival,  which debuted the film with star Amy Adams in the house. You’ll  see aliens, but you won’t laugh at them.', '  Me? I stopped apologizing about my sci-fi habit years ago. Every  once in a while, flipping through a channel, I’ll see something  silly on, like “Attack of the 50 Foot Woman,” “Them!” or,  more seriously, “The Day the Earth Stood Still.” And invariably,  I’ll stop whatever I’m doing, my wife will laugh at me, and I  will stare at black and white images of plastic monsters, and for  a few moments I am 10 years old again, with my crew cut, my  red-striped t-shirt, my baggy dungarees, and my Converse  sneakers, sitting cross-legged on the basement floor of our home  in Warminster, Pennsylvania with our Zenith black-and-white TV  and a TV dinner, preferably fish sticks.  ', '  And I, 50 years after that first episode, am happy again. ', '  Live long and prosper. ']"

The move does not guarantee that  he’ll leave Miami, however, which sets up another highly  anticipated decision about where he’ll play.', '  For the second time in his career, James will become one of the  most pursued free agents in league history.

Maximum salaries are  calculated as a percentage of the league’s salary cap for that  season, according to NBA Salary  Cap FAQ.', ' As he has played for more than 10 years, James is entitled  to the highest maximum salary tier, which would come to $22.12  million under next season’s projected $63.2 million salary cap.

James won’t necessarily take the  maximum salary, though, especially if he negotiates with a team looking to create cap space for another player seeking similar  money. For example, James chose not to take maximum money when signing with the Heat so the team had flexibility to sign Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.', '  James will most likely re-sign with the Heat, Allen said. James probably chose to opt out in order to “send a message” to Miami after this  year’s NBA Finals loss to the San Antonio Spurs, he said.

Absent  the diversified portfolio of Time Warner, Time Inc. will be going  it alone with more than 90 magazines and 45 websites in a market  that views print as a thing of the past.', '  The new entity will start off with $1.3 billion in debt,  including $600 million that will go toward a one-time cash  dividend to Time Warner shareholders. That stands in stark  contrast to Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation, which was given a  $2 billion cash cushion when it was spun off into a separate  company last year. At approximately three times earnings, Time  Inc.’s debt is high-risk, and Moody’s has rated it at less than  investment grade.', '  As recently as 2006, Time Inc. produced about $1 billion in  earnings, a figure that is now down to $370 million. Revenue has  declined in 22 of the last 24 quarters, which has tried the  patience of both investors and Jeffrey L. Bewkes, Time Warner’s  chief executive.', '  There are few bright spots in the business. Though Time  magazine is still profitable, big brand names like Fortune and  Entertainment Weekly are not making large contributions. Worse,  the celebrity category is down across the industry, hurting  People magazine, which produces the bulk of Time Inc.’s profits.  Newsstand sales, once a lucrative part of the People franchise,  have dropped by almost half in the last five years. Current  forecasts show the magazine coming up $25 million short of  projections for the year.', '  More from The New York Times: In Texarkana, Uninsured and on the Wrong Side of  a State Line Noncompete Clauses Increasingly Pop Up in Array  of Jobs Netflix Investors to Vote on C.E.O.-Chairman  Split', ' Against this backdrop, leaders at the company acknowledge  that many of Time Inc.’s most prominent publications will be  fighting not just for attention in a crowded media marketplace,  but for survival.', ' “Every stock needs a dream, something to buy into, but what  is the dream here?” said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at  MoffettNathanson who used to work at Time Inc. “What this company  needs is new ideas, and I haven’t heard any coming out so far.  They are highly leveraged, and leverage can be a good thing if  you are growing, but that hasn’t been that story  here.”', '  It is a stark turn of fortune for a company that was  started by Henry R. Luce in 1922, the kernel around which a giant  entertainment conglomerate formed. Life magazine introduced the  country to bold stories told in photos, and Time magazine became  a byword for stature, offering accessible news analysis that is  still imitated all over the industry. People magazine christened  an era in which celebrities became a kind of American royalty.  The company even birthed the premium cable television channel  with HBO, which last year earned about $1.8 billion in profits  — and which is staying with Time Warner.', '  The task of turning around the company has fallen to Joseph A.  Ripp, the 62-year-old chief executive hired last September. A  former chief financial officer of both Time Inc. and Time Warner,  Mr. Ripp is self-confident, decisive and direct, and is  considered a keen financial operator. He is not speaking publicly  as the spinoff approaches, but he has made it clear to employees  and during a recent road show for investors that he did not take  the job to bleed the company dry, and that he thinks Time Inc.’s  illustrious brand names and its relationship with 150 million  Americans — all of them in its database — will serve as  a platform for growth.', '  Time Inc. will not have the cash to make splashy acquisitions,  but Mr. Ripp appears to prefer to make discrete purchases of  assets that can be bolted onto the existing company. Last week’s  acquisition of Cozi, an organizer app for families that can be  integrated into websites at properties like Real Simple,  Food & Wine and Cooking Light, is an example of  the approach he has articulated.', ' Read More', ' Mr. Ripp has also set about slashing costs in a culture  where liquor carts once rolled in the halls and stories were  chased all over the globe at great expense. According to two  people with knowledge of the strategy, leaders at the company met  with editors of Time Inc. publications last week and told them  they were expected to make deep cuts in staffing and other areas  — totaling 25 percent of editorial costs — in the  coming months.', '  In some respects, the spinoff of Time Inc. is not a surprise. In  recent years Mr. Bewkes has relentlessly focused on Time Warner’s  core business of entertainment and programming, spinning off  AOL and Time Warner Cable in 2009.  Executives at Time Warner say those moves created billions in  shareholder value, with the run-up in Time Warner Cable stock, gains at AOL and improved share  price at Time Warner. They predict that Time Inc. will likewise  find new life as an independent company.', ' So far, investors seem to agree. The pre-spinoff price rose  to $23.48 on Friday, up from an initial price of $20.75. That  would value the new company at about $2.6 billion, according to  Bloomberg.', ' In an email, Mr. Bewkes said: “I started my career at a  Time Inc.-owned company, and its future is very important to me  personally as well as for our shareholders. We’ve worked hard  with Joe and his team to create a financial structure that will  allow them to thrive as an independent company, and I have every  expectation that will happen.”', '  Still, Time Inc. is being sent off into the world with a  less-than-inspiring portfolio. While Time Warner is keeping  CNNMoney, a profitable website, the new company will have to pay  its parent hundreds of millions of dollars for IPC, a struggling  British magazine company that has no other likely buyer. Time  Warner’s Turner Broadcasting paid $200 million for The Bleacher  Report, a digital-only site with great fan loyalty, while  Sports Illustrated has languished at Time Inc. Given the  debt and lack of growth opportunities, skeptics have suggested  the spinoff is more akin to a burial at sea.', '  “They will be the only pure magazine company out there, and  that’s not a story that Wall Street will want to hear,” said Reed  Phillips, a media investment banker with DeSilva & Phillips.', '  The problems Time Inc. will face are not unique in an industry  confronting steep challenges. But interviews with analysts and  dozens of current and former Time Inc. executives suggest that a  series of management missteps, a lack of investment from Time  Warner and downsizing in preparation for the spinoff may have  added to the degree of difficulty.', '  Under Mr. Ripp, all manner of cost-cutting appears to be on the  table. In almost every meeting with investors and employees, he  reminds them that he is constantly reviewing staffing levels.  Some of Time Inc.’s magazines could be sold, and the company’s  real estate holdings could also be reduced, including a large  campus for Southern Progress in Birmingham, Ala., and IPC’s very  valuable headquarters in London.', '  Turmoil within the company has been chronic. Time Inc. has  churned through a series of chief executives over the last four  years. Jack Griffin arrived from Meredith in 2010, but was pushed  out within six months after employees revolted. Laura Lang, an  advertising executive brought in to reconceive the business,  never found her footing in 15 months and left last year with a  severance of nearly $20 million, which outraged the rank and  file.', '  Frustrated, Time Warner began to explore its options. Tax  implications made an outright sale untenable. An attempt to merge  Time Inc. with the Meredith Corporation in early 2013 fell  through.', ' Read MoreInvestors: Don’t judge  this magazine by its cover', '  Mr. Bewkes had a batch of iconic magazines, but he couldn’t keep  them, and no one wanted them. With the Meredith deal dead, and  with the successful spinoffs of AOL and Time Warner Cable still a  fresh memory, Time Warner quickly pivoted to a spinoff.', '  Mr. Ripp was recruited to take on the challenge. As the former  vice chairman of AOL, Mr. Ripp had seen both the possibilities  and perils of digital businesses, and his time as a print  executive convinced him that historical divisions between  editorial and sales were an expensive anachronism. Soon after  arriving, he proposed that editors report to the company’s  business side, and not to the editor in chief, as they had in the  past.', '  That did not sit well with Martha Nelson, the editor in chief who  had turned People magazine into a behemoth and started  InStyle; she left the company. Other top executives  followed, and Mr. Ripp began assembling his own team, including a  longtime associate, Jeffrey J. Bairstow, now Time Inc.’s chief  financial officer.', '  The hiring of Norman Pearlstine, 71, a former editor in chief of  Time Inc. who returned last year as chief content officer, was  viewed as a signal that the integrity of the editorial product  still mattered. But employees have complained that in the  selection of Mr. Ripp and Mr. Pearlstine, Time Inc. anointed  leadership figures tied to the very past it was trying to shed.', '  The new company will place a much bigger emphasis on video. It  has backed 120 Sports, a video start-up that takes a mobile-first  approach. People Now, a new entertainment show, and The Chat,  from Fortune, will be part of the mix. A video hub called The  Daily Cut will pull in content from the various Time Inc.  brands.', '  Magazines will be more closely integrated — stories from  Money will appear on the website of Time, for example. Native  advertising — advertising designed to more closely resemble  the content it appears alongside —  is baked into new  websites for Money and Fortune, which have been built from  scratch now that CNNMoney will belong to Time Warner.', '  Independence can have significant upsides. For decades, the print  division shipped all its earnings to the corporate parent,  leaving little money for acquisitions or improvements, a practice  that one editor likened to Time Warner pulling up a Brinks truck  in front of the building.', '  Mr. Ripp says he believes that after a string of missed  opportunities, Time Inc. has the brands, personnel and  wherewithal to thrive. But he has made it clear to the staff that  he did not bring any magic bullets when he took over, and that it  was up to the magazine operators to rejuvenate their  publications. “I can’t fix it,” Mr. Ripp has said repeatedly in  meetings with senior managers. “You have to figure out a way to  fix it.”', '  —By David Carr and Ravi Somaiya, The New York  Times.

Sri Lanka’s economic crisis affords India an opportunity to wean the country away from Beijing’s influence.', 'Perched just off busy East-West shipping lanes, Sri Lanka has drawn billions in investment under China’s Belt and Road Initiative. The program was launched in 2013 to build ports, roads, railways, pipelines and other infrastructure across Asia.', 'But China has taken over at least one strategic port when Sri Lanka failed to service its debt. New Delhi won a small but significant victory Tuesday when it wrested away a power project earlier granted to China.', 'India is also trying to outdo China in its alacrity to provide financial help to Sri Lanka, which is running dangerously low on foreign reserves to service its debt.

31,Here’s why one solar industry veteran is betting big on clean hydrogen,2022-01-24T18:22:42+0000,"['Raffi Garabedian spent a dozen years developing solar panel technology at First Solar, a photovoltaics company that currently has a market value around $8 billion. The technologist then went on to co-found clean hydrogen start-up Electric Hydrogen, which he’s currently building out as its CEO.', 'Garabedian’s career path may seem surprising. While solar power is almost universally accepted as a clean energy source, hydrogen production is often perceived as a shady corner of the climate space where oil and gas companies are using smoke and mirrors to invent a reason to keep their own infrastructure relevant.', 'But Garabedian knows all that. He also knows that not all hydrogen is created in the same way. And hydrogen is absolutely essential to life on Earth and has tremendous potential to be a linchpin in critical business sectors that will otherwise be hard to decarbonize.', 'A decade ago, the solar industry was “an arms race” to develop the cheapest and best photovoltaics technology, he told CNBC. “Technologists like me, we were in the hot seat, which is what excites me,” he said. Now, the solar industry is in execution mode instead of quick-innovation mode.', 'So he asked himself, “What’s the next thing that needs to be done? What’s the biggest impact thing in decarbonization and climate tech that needs to happen? This is the thought process that led me to hydrogen.”', 'Hydrogen is already essential in chemical industrial processes, including refining crude oil into useful petroleum products and making ammonia-based fertilizer through the Haber-Bosch process, which has helped the world feed itself through massive population growth over the last century.', '“Without it, millions of people die,” Garabedian said.', 'Some purists argue that hydrogen should be produced and used only in chemical processes and to make ammonia, but Garabedian rejects that view.', 'First, he argues, hydrogen fuel could reduce emissions in some sectors of the economy that would be very hard to decarbonize with electricity, like airplanes and large boats.', 'For planes, the weight of the energy source is critical, and hydrogen is both energy-rich and very light — and generates minimal emissions when burned, unlike jet fuel. For long-haul shipping, freight liners need to be able to travel a long time and a far distance without refueling. Ammonia made from both clean hydrogen and compressed hydrogen is a contender for shipping industry fuel sources and cleaner burning than the “bunker fuel” most large ships use today.', 'Hydrogen is also a potential option for long-duration energy storage, which is vital for scaling up solar and wind renewable energy.', 'A lot of people are focused on battery technology for energy storage, and in fact Garabedian sits on the board of ESS, a battery company looking to develop batteries for utilities to store energy for four to 12 hours. But for ultra-long duration — 100 hours of storage or more — natural gas is the most common solution today.', 'For ultra-long storage, hydrogen is less efficient than some other clean technologies, like batteries or pumped hydro, but the amount of energy (capacity) you can store is much greater, according to the Energy Storage Association.', 'With the right technology and infrastructure, solar and wind power could be used to generate hydrogen, which could then be stored and burned later when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing. It can also be shipped around the world to where energy sources are most needed — hydrogen can be converted into a liquid at a super cold temperature and stored and moved on in cryogenic tanks on special ships, similar to how liquified natural gas moves currently.', 'But there’s one big caveat to the use of hydrogen to make the energy sector cleaner.', 'The cheapest ways to make hydrogen today use natural gas. The process produces carbon dioxide, which contributes to climate change. Moreover, collecting and distributing natural gas inevitably results in methane emissions from fugitive leaks — and methane is an even more potent and dangerous greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.', 'This so-called “gray” hydrogen and its cousin, “blue” hydrogen, which is produced in the same way but with an attempt to capture and sequester the carbon dioxide emissions, are nonstarters for Garabedian.', '“Fundamentally, I think most companies in oil and gas see blue hydrogen as a way to perpetuate their business model,” he said. He doesn’t think they can delay it forever.', '“The end of natural gas is around the corner,” he said. “And having been through over a decade in solar, I have this sense that these transitions can happen a lot faster than the entrenched industry wants to believe they can happen.”', 'The answer, Garabedian believes, is to find a cost-effective way to generate hydrogen without the byproducts that warm the climate.', 'One clean way to generate hydrogen is by using clean energy sources like solar and wind to power electrolysis — splitting water, H2O, into hydrogen and oxygen.', 'Electrolysis is expensive today, but Electric Hydrogen aims to fix this by building “very dense” electrolyzers to run inside gigantic and super-efficient plants that can generate as much as 100 megawatts of power, where conventional plants operate at about 5 MW.', '“The kind of plumbing here is not cheap — think high-pressure stainless steel like you might see in a chemical plant,” Garabedian told CNBC. Electric Hydrogen’s approach is meant to reduce the cost of each plant by minimizing plumbing and other infrastructural costs.', 'That’s the idea, anyway — Garabedian wouldn’t share details of the chemical technology involved for fear of giving away trade secrets.', 'It’s important to note that this is all at a very early stage, and the company has no revenue or customers today.', 'The company is just over 2 years old. In 2019, David Eaglesham, the initial CTO at First Solar, was an entrepreneur-in-residence at Bill Gates’ climate investment fund, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, where he was studying how to produce hydrogen cheaply. Eaglesham learned Garabedian was interested in working on a new technology, and the two decided to work together to build a hydrogen company based on some ideas Eaglesham had in his residency. Two other key players on the team are Derek Warnick, who has spent the last decade and a half working in clean energy finance, and Dorian West, who has 25 years’ engineering experience, including 15 at Tesla.', 'The company officially incorporated in December 2019 and self-funded until March 2021, when Electric Hydrogen first raised money. In June, the company announced $24 million led by Breakthrough Energy Ventures.', 'Garabedian knows that success will come only if his solution lowers the cost of energy.', '“The key point is price. These are commodities. We’re not selling Teslas, which you buy not just because they’re clean, you also buy them because [they’re] really fun to drive,” Garabedian said.', 'The cheapest hydrogen today is gray hydrogen made from natural gas down near Henry Hub, Louisiana, where it costs around $1.50 per kilo, according to Garabedian.', '“That’s our target. Our target is to turn renewable energy into $1.50-a-kilo-or-less hydrogen, thereby making it an economical alternative to the dirty gray source,” said Garabedian.', 'If blue hydrogen becomes the industry standard, then the baseline price is likely to move to between $2 and $2.25 per kilo, which “makes it much easier for me to enter the market,” he said.', 'Garabedian learned the hard lesson about economics in his decade in the solar industry.', 'A dozen years ago, the solar industry was supported with subsidies and regulatory mandates, and about 2015, solar energy reached “grid parity,” which means it costs the same as the wholesale price for electricity generated on the grid.', 'Those incremental economic decisions made business by business, day by day, will move the energy transition, according to Garabedian.', '“Economics is what wins. It’s not that people don’t want to do the right thing. But it’s also not that people want to do the right thing. Businesses make economic decisions.”']"

Cohen is an extremely successful entrepreneur turned activist investor. Cohen is the co-founder and former CEO of e-commerce company Chewy, which he built up and sold to PetSmart in 2017 for $3.35 billion. Cohen remained CEO following the acquisition until March 2018, and in June 2019, Chewy went public at a valuation of $8.7 billion. His first 13D filing was on GameStop, which famously soared to almost $500 per share primarily on the back of Reddit forums and short squeezing, making Cohen a paper profit of over $4 billion on his $8.43 average cost on 9,001,000 shares. Cohen proved then that he is a long-term investor more interested in fixing the company than personal profits by not selling a single share as the stock rose to these irrational levels. This is Cohen’s second 13D filing, demonstrating to the market that he is not just an entrepreneur dabbling in interesting stocks but an activist investor with an owner/operational mindset who is passionate about fixing mismanaged companies, particularly in the retail/consumer industries. Clearly, his strategic and operational qualifications in building and running a company in the digital era, give him a ton of credibility. Moreover, he invests only his own money, which certainly distinguishes him from most board directors and even activists.', 'On March 6, RC Ventures (RCV) sent a letter to the company’s board, calling on them to improve operations and maintain the right inventory mix to meet demand, while exploring strategic alternatives that include separating buybuy Baby and a full sale of the company.', 'This is a different situation from GameStop. It is a company with a first-time CEO, declining same-store sales and a strategy that has not been working. It also has an incredibly valuable asset that is not reflected in the stock price – its buybuy Baby business, which is priority number one. The company needs to seriously explore monetizing that asset, which could be worth more than the entire company right now, and while pursuing a strategic transaction for that asset it would make sense to also explore a sale for the entire company.', 'Aside from this, the company needs to focus on operations. Management has been spreading itself very thin, focusing on everything from product mix to sales growth to private label to capital allocation and balance sheet. It needs to focus deeply on a few core issues instead. Ryan Cohen grew Chewy by focusing on one thing – providing a great customer experience. Chewy, GameStop, and BBBY are all somewhat commoditized businesses, and that is how you succeed in commoditized retail. This means having competitive pricing, fast shipping, a good product selection and great customer service. That is where management’s focus should be. Moreover, Bed Bath & Beyond could have better digital penetration like buybuy Baby does.', 'The company has been the subject of recent shareholder activism. On May 28, 2019, Legion Partners, Macellum Capital and Ancora Advisors settled for four board seats for John E. Fleming, Sue E. Gove, Jeffrey A. Kirwan and Joshua E. Schechter. The three funds have sold down their positions, but all four of their directors currently serve on the board. Ryan Cohen has stated that he is not interested in going on this board, likely because he is still heavily investing his time in GameStop, which is far from over. A reasonable outcome here would be to settle on three new, independent board seats with the formation of a strategic alternatives committee with at least one RC Ventures director on the committee, if not heading it. Ryan Cohen is somewhat new to the activism game, but he should not be taken lightly. He has the money, resources and conviction to commence a full-blown activist campaign if he is ignored.', 'Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments.']"

A decade of strong profit  and revenue growth came to an end last year, followed by a  warning in February that profit would fall by as much as 13  percent this year.', '  The group said as recently as May that shifts in currency  exchange rates could hit reported revenues this year but possibly  not profits, enabling it to maintain its forecast at that time.', '  The guidance for lower profits in aero engines, which has been a  more stable part of the business as the drop in the oil price has  seen marine engines cancelled, may surprise investors.', '  The Trent 700 engine was gradually being replaced by the newer  Trent 7000 engine, a move which East said was having more of an  impact on profits than expected.', 'Read MoreRussians dumpingrubles for...

37,Putin’s threats against Ukraine could reinvigorate the U.S. oil and gas industry ,2022-02-16T17:52:24+0000,"['Russian President Vladimir Putin has long made it clear that he is no fan of U.S. shale drilling. But, if he invades Ukraine, he may unwillingly help bring back the American industry.', 'Like other global producers, the U.S. industry was crushed by the pandemic in early 2020. Oil prices crashed, and prices for crude futures even turned negative on the CME for a brief time. An extremely chastened U.S. industry reemerged, with executives more cautious than ever about throwing money down oil wells and angering shareholders.', 'The U.S. industry has been making a slow comeback, helped by rising oil prices, which are up more than 50% in the last year. Putin’s threats against Ukraine have helped drive an already rising oil price well above $90 per barrel to a seven-year high, with nearly 30% of that price rise since the start of the year.', '“The last thing they wanted to do was provide a price incentive for a rebound in U.S. oil and gas production,” said Dan Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit. “They now succeeded in driving up prices, which is strengthening U.S. oil and gas production.”', 'Russia has historically been the largest provider of both oil and natural gas to Europe, and the U.S. has long warned that its control of critical energy sources could prove to be a hazard for European consumers. Yergin said Putin has been a strong opponent of U.S. shale, and as far back as 2013, the Russian president told a public forum in St. Petersburg that shale was a grave threat.', 'President Joe Biden said Tuesday that the U.S. and Russia would continue to use diplomatic channels to avoid a military outcome, but warned the situation remains uncertain. Russia announced Tuesday it was pulling back some of its more than 100,000 troops on the Ukraine border. By Wednesday, however, NATO said Russia instead was increasing its troops.', 'Oil rose Wednesday, with West Texas Intermediate futures for March up 2.6%, at about $94.50 per barrel in afternoon trading.', '“The geopolitics of energy is back with full fury,” Yergin said.', 'Energy is clearly at the center of the conflict. European natural gas prices have been flaring all winter on concerns about short supply. First, the region was unable to put enough natural gas into storage. Then, Russia cut back some supply starting in the fall.', 'Russia sends natural gas to Europe via pipelines running through Ukraine and others, including Nord Stream I. The Nord Stream II pipeline — built to bring gas from Russia to Germany — is finished but still awaiting German approval.', 'Biden repeated Tuesday that if Russia invades Ukraine, that pipeline will not be allowed to operate.', 'Should Russia invade, the U.S. and its allies plan on imposing sanctions on the country, and analysts say a worst-case scenario for energy supplies would be either that the sanctions block Russian energy sales to Europe or Russia chokes off the supply in retaliation.', 'This comes as global oil demand has been moving back toward normal and is expected to pick up even more this summer as air travel improves.', 'Before the pandemic, the U.S. was the largest producer of both oil and gas. Yergin said the U.S. energy industry has regained its position of dominance, and is once more the top oil and gas producer.', 'In addition, the U.S. is a large exporter. The U.S. exported an average 2.6 million barrels a day of oil over the past four weeks, and 4.2 million barrels of refined products, including gasoline and diesel fuel, according to the Energy Information Administration weekly data.', 'The U.S. energy industry has also already proven to be an important alternative supplier for Europeans. In January, ships filled with U.S. liquefied natural gas were diverted from Asia and South America to European ports. According to IHS, that 80% year-over-year jump in LNG imports meant that the U.S., for the first time, provided more natural gas to Europe via ship than Russia did through its pipelines.', 'IHS Markit calculates that 7.73 billion cubic meters of U.S. gas was shipped to Europe in January, compared with 7.5 billion cubic meters through Russia’s pipelines.', 'While U.S. LNG is helping Europe through the winter, it is not a sufficient replacement for Russian gas. Europe can process only so much liquefied natural gas, and analysts say it would still have a shortfall. Qatar also ships LNG to Europe and has capacity to increase its exports.', '“This is the highest level of US LNG to Europe that we’ve ever seen. Looking at European imports from the US so far this month, they are holding up so we expect to see a similar level for February (over 5 million tonnes),” note Kpler analysts in an email to CNBC.', 'Yergin said Europe is the natural market for Russia’s gas. “Europe was in an energy crisis before the Ukraine crisis. The difference now as opposed to 2009, when the Russians interrupted gas flow through Ukraine, the European pipeline system is more flexible, so it can move gas around, and there’s the development of LNG,” he said. “Five years ago, LNG couldn’t make up for Russian supplies being lower.”', 'At the same time, the U.S. oil industry is expected to up production for a tight oil market by an estimated 900,000 barrels a day this year, Yergin said. The industry currently produces about 11.6 million barrels a day and could be back to prepandemic levels of 13 million barrels a day by next year.', 'Evidence of the oil industry’s expanding production is showing up in an increase in rigs. According to Baker Hughes, oil industry rigs now total 516, up 19 rigs last week — the biggest gain in four years.', '“I think the Ukraine crisis has solidified the oil gold rush for all the companies involved, now including the majors like Continental Resources, which just announced a doubling of their spending relative to their output,” Again Capital partner John Kilduff said. “Continental is really doubling down on more production. They’re willing to accept the higher costs for now to get more oil out of the ground over the near and medium term.”', 'The U.S. is a big producer, but Russia is a bigger supplier of world markets, exporting about 5 million barrels a day. If there were an invasion, any loss of Russian oil would be felt globally.', 'Russia and its partners in OPEC+ have slowly been lifting production as demand returns from pandemic levels, and they should reach their goal by summer. But the Russian government has long been wary of oil prices getting too high, since the higher they go, the more incentive there is for U.S. producers to increase production.', 'If Russian crude exports were reduced, analysts expect Moscow’s OPEC+ partner Saudi Arabia would turn on it spigots. The Middle Eastern country has spare capacity to pump oil that the U.S. does not have, and U.S. companies would need to drill new wells to generate much more oil.', 'Kilduff said the U.S. industry, however, is likely to see a surprising surge in oil production soon, since companies have been opening wells that had been drilled but uncompleted.', 'Analysts have said it’s the incremental production from the U.S. and other non OPEC countries, like Brazil, that have been keeping oil prices from shooting sharply higher. But now U.S. producers could be put to the test, even if the Ukraine tensions subside.', 'Dan Pickering, chief investment officer of Pickering Energy Partners, said U.S. oil production has been increasing, but U.S. companies are still not drilling full speed ahead because of pressure from shareholders. Companies have been paying down debt, raising dividends and looking for ways to reduce their carbon output, under scrutiny from ESG [environmental, social, governance] investors.', 'Pickering said that, though relatively small, the jump in the rig count is important. “To me it’s a reflection that oil prices are strong. That small incremental on the margin could be a confluence of a number of things,” he said. “You don’t have a frenzy going on to add activity right now. We have guys out in the Permian right now doing meetings. It’s busy, but not a frenzy. We’ve seen frenzies. It feels pretty good in Midland. It doesn’t feel frenetic.”', 'He expects if the industry does move to increase drilling, the evidence of its efforts would come over the next year, not in the near future. But he noted that Exxon Mobil said it would boost its production in the Permian basin in Texas by 25% this year, and Chevron plans to up its output there by 10%.', '“Let’s assume Russia doesn’t invade. Let’s say oil goes to $82. That’s still a damn good number. The real reinvigoration of this business is when there are no external influences and prices are still good,” he said. “These guys are going to take baby steps for a while unless really pushed.”', 'Pickering said oil futures suggest oil will be around $68 per barrel five years from now, a good but not great price like $90 would be.', '“So the industry has more of a spring in its step. Remember they almost died in 2020. A lot of them did die and went into bankruptcy,” he said. “Things are getting better. People don’t trust it that much, and if you end up with a situation where a geopolitical event spikes oil prices, that’s just going to reinforce this is a tight market. That’s the kind of thing that boosts the industry’s confidence level, even if they don’t necessarily react to that kind of event.”', 'According to IHS, private companies have been boosting production, and they typically account for 20% of increased volume, but this year that number will be 50%.', 'Kilduff noted that Devon Energy announced in its earnings release Tuesday higher-than-expected production, another sign that the industry is increasing output. The company beat earnings expectations and also kept its focus on shareholders, hiking its dividend. Devon shares were up more than 6% on Wednesday.', '“After taking these companies to the wood shed for the past couple of years for for the low price environment, all of a sudden the economics make sense again, and that’s getting them back to their old habits,” Kilduff said.', '— CNBC’s Pippa Stevens contributed to this story.']"

43,Putin’s invasion of Ukraine will knock 30 years of progress off the Russian economy,2022-03-14T15:27:42+0000,"['WASHINGTON — Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked war on Ukraine and the resulting global response will set Russia’s economy back by at least 30 years — close to old Soviet Union times — and lower its standard of living for at least the next five years, according to economists, investors and diplomats.', 'The sweeping Western sanctions are designed to inflict maximum pain on the country’s economy by expelling it from global markets and freezing assets around the world. From the moment they took effect three weeks ago, the sanctions have opened a new chapter in Russia’s economic history.', 'Its financial system and currency are collapsing on multiple fronts, forcing the Kremlin to close the stock market and artificially prop up the ruble inside its borders.', 'Practically overnight, the country’s 40-year effort to build a prosperous market-based economy that began under former leader Mikhail Gorbachev has failed — one more casualty in President Putin’s brutal invasion of Ukraine.', 'Landmark economic and social reforms originating in the 1980s gave the Soviet Union its first taste of American products. But decades of work to integrate the economy into Europe ended in the past few weeks, as blue chip companies quit the Russian market and the United States and European Union moved to wind down trade and tourism with Russia.', 'Two sanctions in particular have wreaked considerable havoc. The first one expelled Russia’s largest banks from the global payments network known as SWIFT, making it very difficult for them to process overseas transactions.', 'The second measure froze hundreds of billions of euros held in reserve by Russia’s central bank. Without reserve funds to shore up the ruble, there is very little the Kremlin can do to prevent its value from collapsing.', 'Meanwhile, the United States and Britain are also halting imports of Russian oil and gas, the U.S. has imposed export controls on high tech equipment and luxury goods, and a growing list of countries have barred Russian ships from their ports.', '“The problem you have now is we’re basically in a spiral where we don’t know how many unrealized losses there are left to realize,” said Maximillian Hess, a Central Asia fellow in the Eurasia program at the nonprofit Foreign Policy Research Institute.', '“So we still can’t rule out that the ruble could collapse, collapse,” he stressed.', 'Already, the snowballing economic crisis in Russia threatens to wipe out decades of economic gains made by ordinary citizens. ', 'In the past month, the ruble has lost 40% of its value against the dollar, rendering the currency effectively useless outside of Russia.', 'Desperate to maintain the ruble’s value inside the country, on March 8 the Kremlin issued a new order barring the exchange of rubles for hard currencies like the U.S. dollar or euro. ', 'This effectively turned the ruble into play money, a currency that only has value in an essentially fictional economy inside Russia, where people aren’t allowed to buy the products to which they’ve become accustomed. Policies like these are erasing credibility built over decades of integrating the Russian economy into the rest of Europe. ', 'What’s more, sanctions on the largest banks have added yet another layer of uncertainty to everyday transactions, like buying a metro ticket in Moscow with Apple Pay, which is prohibited by U.S. sanctions, or exchanging rubles for dollars at a bank, which is prohibited by the Kremlin.', '“There was an emerging middle class [in Russia] that is now going to be knocked back,” said Christopher Smart, chief global strategist and head of the Barings Investment Institute. “It’s going to be isolated. It’s going to have a currency that doesn’t really hold any value outside the country.” ', 'Foreign policy experts also believe that Russia will default on its sovereign debt when more than $100 million in bond payments come due on Wednesday. ', '“Russia is defaulting, that’s guaranteed,” said Hess.', 'Russia’s finance minister recently said the country will pay its sovereign foreign debt in rubles as long as Western sanctions keep almost half of its central bank reserves frozen.', 'But Hess said the contracts governing these debts prohibit Russia from paying them in rubles, meaning an attempt to do so would constitute a technical default.', 'Taken together, the plummeting ruble and the looming defaults make the economy look very risky to lenders. ', '“Russia destroyed any credibility that it has as a borrower for the foreseeable future,” said Hess, an expert on sovereign debt. “It’s never again going to be able to borrow at the rates that it was able to borrow at in recent years.”', 'Since the start of the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, more than 300 of the world’s most iconic brands have voluntarily halted or dialed back their business.', 'Among them are global banks like Goldman Sachs, all Big Four accounting firms and consumer brands like Starbucks and Ford.', '“A lot of these companies pulling out of Russia are not doing it for their reputational reasons,” said Hess. “It’s because they know they’re not going to be able to process payments and move money in and out of the country for the foreseeable future,” due to the sanctions, he said. ', 'Several departures are likely to hit Russians harder than others.', 'For decades, PepsiCo, Levi Strauss and Coca-Cola symbolized freedom for young people behind the Iron Curtain. All three have announced they will suspend sales of their core products.', 'Another high impact exit is the three oil giants: Shell, BP and Exxon, whose departures dealt a body blow to the petroleum-dependent economy. ', 'Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and American Express also suspended services, leaving Russians outside the country unable to use their debit cards and Russian banks scrambling to shift to a Chinese card issuers.', 'One of the most symbolic departures was that of McDonald’s. The fast food chain opened its first restaurant in Moscow in early 1990, an event that was considered a watershed moment in Russia’s opening to the West. Last week, McDonald’s announced that all 850 of its restaurants in Russia would temporarily close.', 'Several of the companies that have halted operations in Russia insist they’ll be back as soon as the fighting in Ukraine is over. But global investment experts say U.S. sanctions and a depreciating ruble make it difficult to envision any of these companies returning this year, or the next.', '“Not next year, not five years from now. It’s going to be a long time before investors go back to Russia,” said Smart of Barings.', 'Unlike their neighbors in Ukraine, who have been living under missile bombardment, average Russians aren’t fleeing for their lives. They’re not even feeling the full effect of the NATO sanctions yet.', '“Very soon, the real impact will hit Russia,” said Smart. “They can’t import medicines. They won’t import spare parts for their airplanes. They won’t have access to any kind of investment to develop their oil fields.”', 'Smart predicted Russia will have a lot of “knockoffs and lookalike cars and cellphones” imported from China.', 'Barring a major change in regime that puts Putin out of power, Hess of the Foreign Policy Research Institute predicted that in five years Russians “will be living in some version of the ’90s and potentially even something worse,” if Putin decides to further manipulate the currency or to weaponize commodities.', 'Even as the Russian economy reels from sanctions that are a direct result of Putin’s war, the increasingly isolated president himself remains very firmly in control of the country. Still, that doesn’t mean he’s invincible.', '“Putin has premised his rule on making sure that people don’t have to live in the living standards and the ways they lived in the 90s again,” said Hess. And for most of his time in power, Putin has lived up to his end of that bargain.', 'When he was first elected president in 2000, he took the helm of a country where 38% of the population lived on less than $5.50 per day, according to World Bank data using 2011 price values. By 2018, that figure had fallen by more than 90%, to just 3.7% of the population.', 'During that time, millions of Russians bought foreign cars and microwaves and TVs. They dressed in brands like Diesel and Mango and Benetton, and they began to take holidays abroad.', 'But if average Russians start to see their standard of living fall as a result of the Ukraine invasion, experts say Putin could have a real problem, given the unwritten social contract he has with voters.', '“The deal was that [Putin] would end the chaos of the 1990s and allow people to be domestically and financially successful,” said Barry Ickes, head of the economics department at Penn State University. “In exchange, the people would agree not to challenge Putin’s political power. And that’s been his deal ever since.”', 'This contract helps to explain how Putin has retained power for two decades, and why so many levels of Russian society have tolerated his evolution into a full-blown autocrat. But it’s also the key to understanding his vulnerability, experts said.', 'For years, the Kremlin has argued that for Russians the freedom to travel and spend money is more important than less tangible freedoms like the freedom to protest against the government.', '“In the early 1990s our people were paupers — and it’s ridiculous to say they were free,” Vladislav Surkov, a leading Kremlin ideologist, said in a 2006 Financial Times interview. “When you have a car to ride in and things to buy, that’s freedom.”', 'If Putin cannot provide “stability and a good level of economic support” to average Russians, said Ickes, then he risks looking as though he’s not honoring the social contract.', 'As the war in Ukraine carries into its third week, both stability and economic support are becoming harder for Putin to provide over.', 'Again and again, investors and policy experts said it’s nearly impossible to envision a realistic scenario in which American companies would resume operations in Russia within the next five years.', '“Once companies leave [Russia] they take some costs and book them on their accounts. And then there’s an environment where you’ve already taken these losses, so it’s a lot harder to convince your risk committee to go back in,” said Hess.', 'Given the direct impact that sanctions are having on the business climate in Russia, securing a full or partial lifting of them is key to making American companies want to come back. ', 'But none of the experts who spoke to CNBC for this story believe that any of the current sanctions against Russia or Belarus are going to be eased or lifted for at least the next three years.', '“Until you have a new leader in Russia, one who apologizes for invading Ukraine and who writes a check for reparations, these sanctions are going to remain in place,” said Smart, of Barings. “And I don’t see any of the three things I just described happening.”', 'Underscoring this is the fact that the current sanctions do not even contain any language about what Russia could do to convince Washington to lift them.', 'For Smart, the best way to understand the Western effort to isolate the Kremlin is to view it as a long-term strategic move, within a 10- to 20-year window.', 'Russia “is the 11th largest economy in the world, and we’re about to seal it up in a container and not do business with it for the foreseeable future,” he said.', 'For everyday consumers, the coming months will test how much of the modern world they are willing to give up to further Putin’s ambitions of control over Eastern Europe. ', '“Until recently, [Putin’s] whole program was relatively popular,” said Ickes, of Penn State. “It’s the last two weeks where there’s been a major shift.”', '“Now the loss of international travel is painful. And the loss of the internet is painful. And your debit card doesn’t work anymore. That’s a big, big, big, deal,” he said.']"
44,Crowdfunding: The new business incubator?,2014-07-24T12:00:00+0000,"['  Many Kickstarter projects reach or exceed their funding goal,  ship their product and build the business from there. But for  some, the end of that campaign is just the beginning of the true  funding process. ', '  As more and more crowdfunding projects go viral, they’re  capturing the attention of the venture capital community, along  with other equity investors. ', '  Of course, there’s no Kickstarter success story that rivals that  of Oculus, which was acquired by Facebook for $2 billion in  March. It was a Cinderella story that’s unlikely to be matched  anytime soon. The now 2-year old venture was able to raise $4.2 million on Kickstarter in 2012 to fund the Rift, an advanced virtual reality headset. That helped it gain the attention of Mark Zuckerberg. ', '  Oculus and others are proof that even after the crowdfunding  process ends, money continues to change hands. ', '  Last month, for example, LIFX, whose Wi-Fi enabled multicolor LED  lightbulbs raised $1.3 million from backers in November 2012,  secured a $12 million Series A funding round led by Sequoia  Capital (bringing the company’s total equity funding to $16.6  million). ', '  Formlabs, whose 3-D printer reached its goal in three hours in  2012, ultimately raising nearly $3 million via crowdfunding,  received $19 million in Series A funding in the fall of 2013.  That same year, the OUYA game console secured $15 million from  Mayfield Fund, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and others.  And Pebble, a smartwatch developed by Pebble Technology that was  rejected by numerous venture capitalists, later picked up $15  million from Charles River Ventures after its enormously  successful Kickstarter campaign. ', ' Read MorePotato salad crowdfunder’s plan for  leftover cash?', '  One of the advantages of a successful Kickstarter is it gives  companies a chance to clearly demonstrate the demand for their  product. The consumer investment they attract to help refine and  move their product closer toward a finished state means angel  investors and venture capitalists don’t have to risk as much  capital.', '  “Proof of demand is nice, but the funding to support the early  product development is even nicer,” said Brad Feld, an  early-stage investor and managing director of Foundry Group.  “It means that start-up can get a hardware product further down  the road—more of an MVP equivalent in software—before  going out to raise money.”', '  Crowdfunding in and of itself, though, isn’t yet a preferred  screening tool for many venture capitalists, although they do  acknowledge it has its advantages. ', '  “There are a variety of factors that go into an investment (team,  market, product, etc. ...) and I would say that crowdfunding  campaigns provide an additional factor, but they do not really  outweigh the others,” said Omar Hamoui, a partner at Sequoia  Capital. “Showing proof of demand is the key advantage. Even with  this, though, we frequently think about whether crowdfunding  results are proof of deep and enduring demand or whether it is a  shallow pool of early adopters.”', ' Read MoreFunded! The top Kickstarter  campaigns', '  For some crowdfunded properties, the process is less about  attracting equity investors and more about finding a distribution  partner. For example, video game developer Pwnee Studios  successfully funded Cloudberry Kingdom in 2012, raising $23,582  for the platform title. That was enough to not only fund a PC  prototype of the game but to put them on the radar of Ubisoft.', '  The French game-publishing giant struck a deal with Pwnee and  released a console version of the game last year.', '  “Kickstarter gives an alternate source of funding to develop and  prototype a full game and then bring it to publishers,” said Chris Early, vice president of digital publishing at Ubisoft.  “It’s beyond proof of concept at that point. ... That reduces our  risk considerably. And what that means for the developer is they  get a better deal. Instead of us making a speculative upfront  investment, we’ve got a lot more visibility.”', 'Read MoreYou hear lots about crowdfunding, but what is it?', 'However, there are risks that come with big investments in, or buyouts of, crowdfunded projects. While users of Kickstarter or  Indiegogo are told up front they have no equity stake in the  products they contribute to, many still feel a sense of ownership. And when the company is bought out, that can trigger  an angry knee-jerk reaction. ', '  Oculus discovered this firsthand, in a scary way, after the Facebook purchase. Some overly emotional backers made physical threats to  the company’s employees and their families after the transaction was announced.', '  “We expected a negative reaction from people in the short term; we did not expect to be getting so many death threats and  harassing phone calls that extended to our families,” said Oculus  founder Palmer Luckey in a Reddit posting months after the deal.  “We know we will prove ourselves with actions and not words, but  that kind of [expletive] is unwarranted, especially since it is  impacting people who have nothing to do with Oculus.”', '  There’s also the pressure inherited from the successful  crowdfunding round itself. That established base of customers  expects the product as soon as possible, so any production  delay could cause problems. That’s why it’s important that crowdfunders make sure the product is on track before investing—or be ready to handle the fallout. ', 'Read MoreCrowdfunding of start-ups will be huge: Indiegogo CEO', '  “I think the more successful a project is, especially when it is  a prelaunch physical product, it creates a ‘debt’ that the  founders need to deliver on,” said Hamoui. “As this can sometimes  take years to do, it is a significant overhead on the progress of  the company. What if the market changes and the promised product  is no longer the best strategic choice for the company? It  doesn’t matter; they still have to deliver on what they  promised.”', 'The bottom line is that founders need to deliver on their promises, explained Hamoui. The advance financial support of consumers isn’t a free pass. While users might put up with slight delays on a new product or service, their window of patience is limited. And testing that patience can affect a company’s valuation when they’re a crowdfunding superstar.', '—By Chris Morris, special to CNBC.com']"
