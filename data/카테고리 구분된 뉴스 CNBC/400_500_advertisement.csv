Streets are crammed with delivery vans blocking traffic. City curbs are increasingly a turf war between delivery drivers and everyone else. Even grocery store aisles can feel crowded — at least, when staff for delivery services are scouring the shelves.', 'Americans are demanding more deliveries, and as a result, many of the things needed for delivery are becoming scarce. And with many companies pushing to meet that demand, industry experts say the U.S. faces a problem — its infrastructure can only handle so many deliveries.', 'The crunch has been extreme in the weeks leading up to Christmas, but it’s a year-round phenomenon, and it’s one that’s causing people up and down the delivery chain to rethink the design of American cities, streets and buildings.', '“E-commerce has completely transformed the industrial market, and we’re still kind of wrapping our heads around it,” said Matthew Walaszek, an associate director of research at CBRE, a commercial real estate firm.', 'It’s a transformation years in the making and inspired by convenience. Amazon Prime launched in 2005, tantalizing consumers with two-day delivery and whetting their appetites for the parade of delivered goods that would follow: prepared food, groceries, gifts, paper towels, mattresses, wardrobe recommendations and nearly anything else that could fit in a box.', 'Established retailers have chased Amazon’s lead in home delivery, while startup companies are forgoing malls or other physical locations and selling directly to customers, through the mail or other delivery service.', '“Seven years ago, thinking that you’d be getting cheeseburgers delivered by the millions was kind of crazy, right?” said Chris Baggott, CEO of ClusterTruck, a food and delivery company founded in 2015.', 'But the reckoning has arrived: The physical infrastructure of the country doesn’t yet match its delivery ambitions. There’s just too much stuff getting delivered.', 'Start with the warehouse space, from the massive 1 million-square-foot fulfillment centers to the “last mile” depots closer to city centers. Though the U.S. has added around 1 billion square feet of warehouse space in the past six years, the vacancy rate is near a historic low and rent is still rising, according to CBRE data.', '“Our warehouses are stacked to the brim,” Walaszek said.', 'Developers have begun to think vertically. Last year, Prologis built the country’s first three-story warehouse in Seattle, with ramps so that delivery trucks can access the upper floors. Industry analysts say multifloor warehouses are beginning to make sense in areas where land is pricey, and for the first experiment Amazon and Home Depot signed on as tenants.', 'Now, similar buildings are in the works, including a planned four-story warehouse in a Brooklyn industrial park. (Multistory warehouses are already a reality in Asia, where they rise more than 20 stories high and have ramps long enough to accommodate foot races.)', 'A new model has popped up to rent the unused corners in warehouses, like an Airbnb but for spare capacity to store and ship inventory. Startups such as Flexe, Flowspace and CubeWork offer short-term rentals that are flexible on the amount of space and location — helpful for a retailer that doesn’t want to commit to leasing a whole building.', '“Everybody is trying to figure out how to catch up with Amazon with two-day shipping,” said Dave Glick, chief technology officer of Flexe. But, he added: “The capital that Amazon has invested over the last 20 years, most likely no one is ever going to reproduce.”', 'Amazon has continued its investment beyond warehouses, building a delivery fleet that is now up to 30,000 trucks and vans, Bloomberg News reported last week, in a boon to the big automakers who manufacture the vehicles.', 'But absent the arrival of new vans, retailers have been enticing people to use their personal vehicles to deliver packages through Amazon Flex, Walmart’s Spark Delivery and companies such as Instacart, whose workers shop for and deliver groceries. This month, Old Navy struck a deal with Postmates for drivers to deliver last-minute Christmas gifts.', 'And it’s not just gifts and food that people are having delivered. Companies that sell larger items — like Wayfair, Overstock and a raft of mattress startups — are increasingly shipping bulky items to doorsteps.', 'In at least some markets, managers for delivery companies say they have trouble finding and keeping enough drivers, who, with unemployment nationally at a 50-year low, may have other options.', 'That’s also creating some questions about safety.', '“As demand grows, it becomes extremely difficult to find qualified people to do the job safely in the short amount of time that you have to find them and train them properly,” said Amber King, a former manager for UPS in Virginia.', 'The scarcity issue extends to the physical infrastructure of U.S. streets, which in most places have not been designed to accommodate delivery trucks in significant numbers. In New York City, more than 1.5 million packages are delivered daily, and they bring along gridlock, safety concerns and pollution, The New York Times reported in October.', '“If we all keep on buying as we are year after year, without regard to the impact, we are doomed,” José Holguín-Veras, a professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, told Time magazine last year.', 'To try to help overwhelmed city planners, last year the Institute of Transportation Engineers published a 50-page Curbside Management Practitioners Guide, saying it wanted to help people in “optimizing curb space in this time of change.” Washington, D.C., is experimenting with new pick-up/drop-off zones, or PUDOs.', 'Social media is filled with complaints from people who dislike seeing all the delivery services in their neighborhoods, and some companies are looking for alternatives — whether it’s long-promiseddelivery drones, cargo bikes that first caught on in Europe or scooters that can fit into bicycle lanes.', '“The issue is, there’s nowhere to park, and if you’re making multiple stops in that van, you have to find ‘nowhere to park’ multiple times,” said Max Smith, CEO of OjO Electric, a maker of battery-powered scooters currently being tested to deliver takeout food. “You have to double-park, and then you get tickets.”', 'Sometimes the answer has been to cut out final home delivery entirely. There are Amazon lockers, and some food delivery companies require customers to meet drivers at the curb rather than their front door.', 'Then there’s what retailers call BOPUIS: buy online, pick up in store.', '“What is the final conveyance vehicle? Is it a delivery person with a pushcart going that last mile? Is it a courier with a satchel on her back? Or is it some form of airborne conveyance?” asked Benjamin Conwell, a former Amazon fulfillment executive who now advises companies on logistics for the real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield.', 'The logistics industry is going to learn a lot in the next several years, he said, and it may continue to feel big strains.', '“That demand is not going to abate,” Conwell said. “We don’t see the basic trend tapering much at all.”']"
1,A major U.S. pipeline is still mostly shut due to a cyberattack.

A hacker group known as DarkSide may be responsible for the attack.', 'Colonial Pipeline said Sunday it is developing a system restart plan, and that some smaller lines are now operational.', 'The company said it will “bring our full system back online only when we believe it is safe to do so, and in full compliance with the approval of all federal regulations.”', '“Timing of the restart is the critical issue,” Wells Fargo analyst Roger Read said in a note on Sunday. He outlined three possible date ranges:', '1. Fewer than five days: If a partial restart of the pipeline begins by Wednesday, there will be “no significant or lasting impacts.”', '2. Six to 10 days: Refiners may need to reduce the amount of crude oil they process if the pipeline remains shut for up to 10 days. Inventories will rise in the U.S. Gulf Coast, causing prices to fall, while prices in the East Coast would jump, the analyst said. The East Coast is also likely to import more waterborne fuel, and spot shortages will start to take place in parts of the Southeast.', '3. More than 10 days: Refiners in the Gulf Coast will almost definitely have to reduce their runs, and oil prices may weaken compared with waterborne crudes to encourage exports. “Expect significant fuel shortages in the interior Southeast of the U.S.,” Wells Fargo said in the note.', 'Colonial operates the country’s largest refined products pipeline and transports 2.5 million barrels per day, according to its website. It connects refineries from the U.S. Gulf Coast to more than 50 million people in the South and East.', 'The pipeline transports gas, diesel, home heating oil and jet fuel.', 'Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, said there hasn’t been much information on when the pipeline could come back online.', '“There’s really been no news,” he told CNBC’s “Street Signs Asia” on Monday.', '“Even well-placed sources I’ve talked to really have nothing to say, and so the market really has no idea if this could be online tomorrow, if it’s going to be three days,” he said.', 'That may be why the market has responded “very cautiously.”', 'Gasoline futures were up 1.28% to $2.1542 per gallon, while heating oil futures rose 0.73% to $2.0252.', 'West Texas Intermediate crude futures, the U.S. oil benchmark, advanced 61 cents to $65.51 per barrel. International benchmark Brent crude traded at $68.96 per barrel, gaining 68 cents. Natural gas futures were down 0.57% at $2.94 per million British thermal units.', '“It’s hard to know if Colonial or the authorities in this issue even have a feeling for when this could be resolved themselves,” De Haan said. “I think you’re seeing the market respond very cautiously, not knowing if this could extend into five, seven, 10, 14 days.”', 'Barges may be a “good alternative” way to transport refined products to other parts of the U.S., said De Haan. However, the government would need to waive the Jones Act, which requires trade between U.S. ports to be carried on ships that are built, owned and operated by U.S. citizens or permanent residents.', '“I would think that that could happen relatively soon, but again that may offer detail on where the situation is going,” he said. “Perhaps the federal government doesn’t yet think that that is necessary.”', 'Analysts from RBC Capital Markets said in a note that the East Coast could draw down inventories, rely on other districts, or increase gasoline imports — but these options would lead to higher energy prices.', 'As the outage continues, the situation could become more severe as time is running out, De Haan said.', '“In the day or two ahead, we could start to see products running low or completely out in some of these affected regions,” he said.', '— CNBC’s Emma Newburger contributed to this report.']"

Moderna found its potential vaccine to be more than 94% effective in preventing Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Pfizer’s preventative, also in a late-stage trial, found its vaccine to be 90% effective.', 'When the federal government approves a vaccine, it must be distributed to the states where state leaders are responsible for distributing it to residents, Cramer said about the next steps. Multiple companies will play a role in logistics, including refrigeration needed for the products.', 'He recommended investors look at names like FedEx and UPS for shipping services, McKesson for distribution, Carrier for freezer trucks and CVS Health for administering the shot.', '“They’re the ones who’ll ultimately solve this crisis, assuming we can convince enough people to take the darned vaccine,” he said.', 'Below are Cramer’s takeaways for each stock:', '“I really like the stock of UPS right here. It’s selling for roughly 20-times next year’s earnings estimates,” he said. “I believe in [CEO Carol] Tomé’s leadership and the company should make a fortune distributing the vaccine before the stay-at-home economy dries up.”', '“They built out a ton of infrastructure after shipping vaccines for the swine flu epidemic 11 years ago. That may give them an edge here,” the host said.', '“Carrier makes freezer trucks and they’re all in on ensuring we have enough of them. They’re integral to the chain,” Cramer said.', '“Before the vaccine gets to the logistics plays, it will likely go through the drug distributors,” he said. “This is where the big money’s going to be made. It’s an oligopoly industry. It’s controlled by McKesson, Cardinal Health … and AmerisourceBergen.”', '“If you want to buy one, I say you buy McKesson. That’s the largest, it’s the best-run and, crucially, the only drug distributor that’s specifically been selected to participate [in] Operation Warp Speed,” he added.', '“The government has agreements with CVS and Walgreens to give the vaccine to residents of long-term care facilities,” Cramer said. “Everyone with pharmacy exposure gets a boost.

He wanted a drone  that didn’t restrict him to only taking pictures, or only racing. “It got to the point where I was wanting to push the  limits.”', 'After creating a “wish list” of all the things he wanted  in a drone, Matus formulated the concept for Teal, and the prototyping  process began. Keep in mind, this CEO was only 16 at the time, and he had homework, projects and papers to keep up with, too.', 'After years of “flying, crashing, rebuilding and modifying”  dozens of versions of his product, Matus completed his dream drone, the Teal.', 'Teal can fly faster than 70 mph, with no  out-of-the-box modifications needed, and the drone is able to  withstand 40 mph gusts.

Further, Matus said the platform  will come with an open software development kit, which he  hopes app developers and other drone makers will  adopt.', 'At $1,300, Teal’s price falls in line with the  market-leading DJI Phantom  series. The drone will be available to the public early next year, and 500 units are available for  preorder now, ready to ship just ahead of the December holidays.', '“I started racing drones before they were cool, and now  there’s a big community growing out of this,” Matus said. “Teal  wants to give racers something that works out of a box, …  something they don’t have to tinker with.” Most racers either  have to modify their own drones or build one from scratch, Matus  said.

7,Here are the most important execs at Microsoft under Satya Nadella,2020-02-23T14:31:01+0000,"['Satya Nadella has almost completely changed the group of top Microsoft executives who make key decisions and iron out issues since taking the company’s CEO title from Steve Ballmer in 2014.', 'Today’s senior leadership team includes the leader of LinkedIn, Microsoft’s biggest acquisition yet, but has no single person who’s responsible for all of Windows. From the Ballmer years, only finance chief Amy Hood and legal head Brad Smith have stuck around with Nadella.', 'In 2014, Nadella asked each person on the senior leadership team to make an ”‘all in’ commitment as we embark on the next chapter for the company,” he wrote in a memo to employees. He announced at the same time that Skype executive Tony Bates, who had been a candidate for Microsoft CEO, was leaving.', 'In the years since, a handful of other leaders have left, including Windows chief Terry Myerson, Nokia leader Stephen Elop (also once a CEO candidate) and business solutions executive Kirill Tatarinov. Most recently, artificial intelligence and research head Harry Shum left the leadership team recently after 23 years at the company, a spokesperson confirmed.', 'But the departures haven’t resulted in deep institutional knowledge going away. Eight of the 14 people on the current SLT, as the executive group is known at Microsoft, have been at the company for at least two decades. The group gathers each Friday, and meetings can span as long as seven hours, as Fast Company reported in 2017.', 'Here are the current members of Microsoft’s SLT:', 'Nadella grew up in Hyderabad, India, and joined Microsoft from Sun Microsystems in 1992 as a program manager in the company’s Windows developer relations group. In the years to come he worked on advertising, search, commerce and public cloud, among other areas. At one point in the early 2000s, Jeff Bezos tried to recruit him to Amazon, but then-executive Doug Burgum (now the governor of North Dakota) convinced him to stay, Burgum told Fast Company in 2017.', 'It turned out to be a good career move.', 'After Steve Ballmer announced plans to step down as CEO in 2013, Nadella became Microsoft’s third CEO on February 4, 2014, and immediately set out transforming the company. He emphasized areas like cloud where Microsoft was a challenger rather than a leader, and formed partnerships with rivals like Red Hat and SAP. Nadella has insisted that Microsoft loves open-source software despite Microsoft’s past attacks on Linux, and he has made it clear that the Windows operating system, the historical core of Microsoft, was no longer the top priority.', 'Nadella also set about changing Microsoft’s cutthroat and bureaucratic culture. He encouraged employees to have a so-called “growth mindset” — the belief that people can develop new skills and knowledge with enough effort — after his wife, Anu, introduced him to the book “Mindset” by Carol Dweck years ago. Soon after becoming CEO, he asked top Microsoft executives to read “Nonviolent Communication” by Marshall Rosenberg.', 'It “was the first clear indication that Satya was going to focus on transforming not just the business strategy but the culture as well,” legal chief Brad Smith has said.', 'Nadella received $42.9 million in total compensation in the 2019 fiscal year. Microsoft’s independent board members recognized Nadella’s efforts to improve the company’s culture in the most recent fiscal year, and they felt that his engagement with customers, partners and investors was “exceptional.” They credited him for leading the company to record financial results.', 'Many people have observed that Nadella is especially present when he meets with people in person. “He has a hugely proactive and incredibly connected listening [style]. So he’s with you,” executive vice president Jean-Philippe Courtois has said. “You can feel it. You can see the body language. And it doesn’t matter if you’re a top executive or a first-line seller, he has exactly the same quality of listening.”', 'As executive vice president of Microsoft’s Worldwide Commercial Business, Althoff is in charge of commercial business strategy for enterprise, public sector, small and medium-sized businesses and other areas.', 'He joined Microsoft in 2013 from Oracle to become president of Microsoft’s North American business, reporting to Microsoft’s then-operating chief, Kevin Turner. Turner left in 2016, opening the way for Althoff, among others, to take more responsibility. Prior to joining Microsoft, Althoff had spent 11 years at Oracle, most recently as senior vice president for worldwide alliances and channels and embedded sales. He had worked at EMC prior to that.', 'Althoff led the development of a major sales reorganization in 2017 that saw Microsoft go deeper in key industries like retail and health care.', 'Capossela, Microsoft’s chief marketing officer and executive vice president for marketing and consumer business, wears several hats. He’s in charge of Microsoft’s marketing and communications, the consumer and device sales teams, along with advertising, sales and physical stores.', 'In 1991 Capossela, known inside Microsoft as ChrisCap, graduated with a bachelor’s degree from Harvard University, which Bill Gates had dropped out of in 1975, and went to work at Microsoft as a marketing manager. In the late 1990s he spent two and a half years as Bill Gates’ speech assistant, and was corporate vice president for Office marketing for more than seven years, according to his LinkedIn profile.', 'A 2011 Microsoft statement described Capossela as being “instrumental in ushering Office into the cloud with Office Web Apps and Office 365.” Nadella made him marketing chief in 2014. He delegated everything, one former Microsoft marketing executive told AdAge in 2014.', '“Marketing at Microsoft includes building a profitable business, so understanding the flow of money is crucial,” Capossela said in a 2014 interview.', 'Courtois, known by his initials JPC, is an executive vice president and president of Microsoft global sales, marketing and operations. He heads up Microsoft’s commercial business across Microsoft’s many subsidiaries.', 'He joined Microsoft as a channel sales representative in 1984, before the company’s 1986 initial public offering, and in 1994 he became general manager of Microsoft France.', 'In the early 2000s he was CEO of Microsoft’s Europe, Middle East and Africa branch, then became president of Microsoft’s international business until July 2016, when Kevin Turner left. Then he became executive vice president and president for global sales, marketing and operations.', 'Courtois received $15.1 million in total compensation in the 2019 fiscal year. Microsoft board members gave him kudos for having a “customer-obsessed” approach and pushing for more conversations about diversity and inclusion in the most recent fiscal year.', 'DelBene is Microsoft’s chief digital officer and executive vice president of corporate strategy and the Core Services Engineering and Operations group. He looks after Microsoft’s internal technology and its strategy, keeps track of competitive issues and explores potential business opportunities.', 'He joined Microsoft in 1992 from McKinsey, where he had been a management consultant, and eventually rose to be president of Microsoft’s Office division.', 'DelBene is considered a founder of Office 365, a core part of Microsoft’s modern cloud push. He was previously general manager for Outlook and group program manager for Exchange. The BBC once described DelBene as “the man behind the PowerPoint presentations.” In 2013 he retired from Microsoft as part of a Microsoft reorganization. Months later President Obama asked him to help fix Healthcare.gov. In 2015 DelBene returned to Microsoft on Nadella’s request.', 'He led Office when Microsoft was building the software to make Office apps work on Apple’s iPad -- an initiative that Ballmer was lukewarm about, but that Nadella brought to fruition when he took over.', '“It came to a point where I had discussions with Steve [Ballmer], and Steve was really kind of conflicted about it,” DelBene said at a company event in 2015. “He thought of us as the Windows company first and foremost, and would Office be strong if Windows wasn’t strong? And my perspective was both need to be strong and Office will not be able to fundamentally be the thing that changes that equation one way or the other. But what it could do, if we didn’t have cross-platform, is it could reduce the value of Office and the value proposition for Office very substantially. And so we went back and forth a couple of times. He finally said, ‘Nope, I don’t want to ship it.’ And one of the very first things that Satya did when he became CEO is he shipped the iPad version of Office.”', 'In 2012 his wife, Suzan DelBene, a former Microsoft executive herself, became a U.S. representative for Washington’s 1st Congressional district.', 'Guthrie, known by his email handle ScottGu, is executive vice president in charge of the company’s Cloud and AI group. In 2018 Guthrie gained more power when Microsoft divvied up the Windows and Devices Group and moved a good chunk of it — the Windows platform team — into his organization.', 'He joined Microsoft immediately after taking his bachelor’s degree from Duke University in 1997.', 'He was a founding member of the team that developed Microsoft’s .NET, a set of technologies for software developers to write applications. He’s also the father of ASP.NET, for building web applications.', 'For many years he has shown up at events in solid red polo shirts, the closest Microsoft comes to having a person with a regular uniform like former Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who often wore black turtlenecks.', 'In 2011 he took control of the application platform team for Azure, Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure offering that competes with Amazon Web Services, to get developers building on Azure. Back then Azure was not the company’s biggest priority, and it wasn’t the easiest thing to use. Even some Microsoft executives had trouble with it, Business Insider reported.', 'The day before Nadella became CEO, he asked Guthrie to take over for him as head of Microsoft’s Cloud and Enterprise business that includes Azure. “We’ve worked so closely together, so it was a pretty quick conversation,” Guthrie said in a 2019 interview.', 'Hogan is Microsoft’s executive vice president of human resources and chief people officer. She led the charge on an overhaul of the employee performance review process. She worked on the company’s paid-leave policy, and under her Microsoft has made inclusion a higher priority. She’s also addressed questions about harassment complaints within the company.', 'She earned a bachelor’s degree from Harvard in 1988, according to her LinkedIn profile, then joined Microsoft from McKinsey in 2003 as vice president of customer and partner experience and worldwide field operations. She later took responsibility for technical support as well. She became chief people officer in 2014 after Nadella called her while she was on a road trip during a sabbatical and asked her to take the job.', '“I think Satya really had a vision for making this a purpose-driven place and also an exceptional place for people to work, and so I thought, ‘What a great chance to go do that,’” she said in a conversation with Capossela.', 'Hogan is Nadella’s “partner in transforming our culture,” he wrote in his 2017 book “Hit Refresh.” She became a bigger supporter of Nadella after seeing how he handled criticism for saying in 2014 that women shouldn’t ask for raises but instead have faith in the system.', '“He didn’t blame anybody,” she said. “He owned it. He came out to the entire company, and he said, ‘We’re going to learn, and we’re going to get a lot smarter.’”', 'As Microsoft’s chief financial officer, Hood runs the finance group, giving her responsibility for acquisitions, tax planning, treasury activities, accounting, internal audits and investor relations.', 'Hood graduated from Harvard Business School in 1999 and worked as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs. She joined Microsoft in 2002, initially working in the company’s investor relations team. Later she was chief of staff of Microsoft’s Server and Tools group, and in 2010 she became finance chief of the Microsoft Business Division. She helped lead the transition to Office 365, and oversaw the acquisitions of Skype and Yammer.', 'When Hood stepped up to replace Peter Klein as finance chief in 2013, becoming the first woman to hold that role in company history, the strategy seemed to be less about growing revenue than cutting costs. “Peter has built a world-class finance team, and I am set up well to continue the company’s strong discipline around costs and focus on driving shareholder value,” she said.', 'By 2015, as executives were planning the company’s briefing for financial analysts, Hood felt that the company should show investors how Microsoft could become more relevant, according to a 2017 Harvard Business School case study. At that meeting, Nadella introduced an ambitious new goal focused on growth rather than costs: The company aimed to achieve a $20 billion annualized revenue run rate from commercial cloud services including Azure, Office 365, Dynamics and enterprise mobility services in the 2018 fiscal year. Microsoft achievedthat goal.', 'She received $20.2 million in total compensation in the 2019 fiscal year. Board members gave Hood credit for “record year financial performance and management” and cost cutting across multiple departments in the most recent fiscal year.', 'As Microsoft’s executive vice president of experiences and devices, Jha leads one of the major groups of engineers in the company. Most of his time at Microsoft he’s worked on software for business use, and he’s worked on the Office suite for many years. A 2018 reorganization gave him purview over more products, including devices and the Windows client. Jha has a say in the planning process for where Microsoft’s data centers should be, alongside Scott Guthrie.', 'Jha joined Microsoft in 1990 as a software design engineer immediately after receiving a master’s degree from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. He contributed to five releases of the Microsoft Works suite and later developed multimedia technologies.', '“I said, ‘Wow, I can’t believe they’re actually trusting me to ship stuff,’” he recalled in a 2018 conversation with Dharmesh Thakker of Battery Ventures. “And sure enough, you know, I had some hideous bugs that went out in the first release, and I was incredibly down on myself.”', 'He remembered being conflicted about whether he wanted to be a developer or a manager, and he flip-flopped between the roles before his ascent to the top tiers of management at the company.', '“Outside of work, you will often find me playing sports with my two sons. I am an avid sports fan and love to watch and play football, soccer, golf — sometimes more than my wife appreciates. ;),” he wrote in a 2008 blog post.', 'Jha speaks in bullet points, his former administrative assistant, Genise Dawson, has said.', 'As executive vice president of business development, Johnson oversees Microsoft’s business partnerships and corporate venture capital program, M12. She also has considerable influence on the company’s M&A strategy.', 'She was Nadella’s first big hire as CEO, joining from Qualcomm. Her first assignment was to improve Microsoft’s relationship with Samsung, which was upset that Microsoft had entered the smartphone space by buying Nokia in 2013. At Qualcomm she had leadership roles in engineering, sales and marketing, as well as business development. Prior to that, she had worked on anti-submarine warfare as an engineer at GE. She was one of 15 kids.', 'Her total compensation for the 2019 fiscal year exceeded $10.4 million.

He’s typically spent a few days a week at headquarters in Redmond, Washington. “I will in all honesty say it’s not my favorite thing in the world,” he said on a podcast in 2018. “I’ve sort of been shocked that I’ve been able to do as much of this job as I have been able to do remotely.”', 'He arrived at Microsoft through the acquisition of LinkedIn, where he had been a senior vice president, and was named Microsoft’s technology chief in 2017, less than two months after the acquisition closed.

It still runs the service, which it bought for $350 million two years ago.', 'Battito had been a Stitch Fix subscriber. She paid a $20-a-month styling fee, which was applied as a credit to items she bought, and she returned anything she didn’t want. But she thought renting was much more sustainable. She could choose the items herself instead of a stylist picking for her. She also didn’t have to keep purchasing new clothes or throwing away old clothes.', '“This way, you’re getting wear out of something, and it’s not just sitting there,” she said. “It really seems like a better way to do things rather than just to keep purchasing things and keep wanting more.”', 'She also said not having to dry-clean the clothes is another big plus.', 'Sucharita Kodali, an analyst at Forrester, said many consumers are fatigued with subscription services and feel pressured to purchase every few weeks or months because of the recurring styling fee.', '“Why do you want to lock yourself into a recurring billing stream when there’s so much choice in fashion and you can already buy what you need when you need it? It just becomes really difficult to make a compelling case long-term,” she said.', 'Stitch Fix declined to comment.', 'That’s part of the reason companies like Urban Outfitters are instead turning to rental services, imitating Rent the Runway and Le Tote, which costs $79 a month. Le Tote is also nearing a deal to buy luxury department store Lord & Taylor.

Macy’s and J.C. Penney’s announced that they would be experimenting with giving ThredUp floor space in stores.', 'But Kodali said rental services still face their fair share of challenges. One of the biggest is how to deal with cleaning the apparel after it’s returned.', '“Dry cleaning and shipping are expensive, and that is a substantial cost,” Kodali said. Rent the Runway, which launched its rental service in 2016, is one of the most popular options. It operates out of a 250,000-square-foot warehouse in New Jersey, and just opened a 300,000-square-foot one in Texas. The warehouses are believed to be the largest dry cleaners in the country.

12,The biggest change in global fuel regulations since leaded gas went away could cause price shocks,2019-03-01T13:46:53+0000,"['Tens of thousands of ships sailing the world’s oceans currently burn more than 3 million barrels a day of a high sulfur, sludge-like fuel, but starting next year the shipping industry will have to comply with rules to dramatically reduce sulfur emissions.', 'The change, mandated by the United Nations International Maritime Organization (IMO), is significant. The industry now burns fuels with a sulfur content of as high as 3.5 percent and will have to cut back to 0.5 percent.', 'For the world transportation market, the change is profound because shipping fuel is literally from the bottom of the oil barrel, like asphalt. The new fuel, however, will be much more refined and more like the lower sulfur diesel used by truckers and in jet fuel.', 'While huge investments have already been made, the change on Jan. 1 could send ripples through the transportation industry, causing estimated price spikes of 20 percent or more for fuel of all sorts.', 'As a result, cargo prices, airline tickets and the cost of sending a package could rise. Some analyst say there could even be temporary fuel shortages, as refiners and transport companies scramble to meet the needs of the shipping industry.', 'Ships can get avoid using the new fuel, which will be more expensive, by equipping themselves with multi-million dollar scrubbers to limit sulfur emissions from the current fuel. But a limited amount of ships can make those changes because it is costly and it may not be worthwhile on an older vessel.', 'The new regulations are the result of a recommendation that came from a subcommittee at the United Nations more than a decade ago and was adopted in 2016 by the UN’s IMO, which sets rules for shipping safety, security and pollution.', 'More than 170 countries including the U.S. have signed on to the fuel change. Starting in 2020, ships found in violation of the new laws risk being impounded, and ports in cooperating countries are expected to police visiting vessels.', '“This is the biggest change in fuel specifications since lead was taken out of gasoline, and it’s global,” said Tom Kloza, head of global energy analysis at Oil Price Information Service. The phaseout of lead additives in fuels first began in 1970s but was mostly eliminated in the 1980s, and the final additives were banned in the 1990s.', 'The shipping industry will have to make its switch over to the new fuel on a hard deadline.', 'Some companies have added new ships that run on liquified natural gas, but that is limited. Fleets are expected to increasingly add LNG fueled ships but the transition could take a number of years. The shipping industry now uses more than 5 million barrels of fuel a day, including the high sulfur fuel, lighter marine fuel and a tiny amount of LNG, according to Citigroup.', '“The fuel now used in shipping is the bottom of the barrel. It’s a very heavy black diesel oil that shippers use because it’s cheap. It also is one of the most polluting fuels. So it’s understandable people would want to regulate it. The whole purpose of this regulation change is to protect human health. That’s why it was proposed in 2007,” said Rick Joswick, head of oil pricing and trade flow analytics at S&P Global Platts.', 'While big shortages of marine fuel are not anticipated, the price of diesel, used in trucking, could temporarily jump and become more volatile starting in the fourth quarter as ships begin to fuel up for long journeys, energy analysts say. The actual impact is difficult to measure, because it will also be driven by oil prices, and it could affect other fuels too.', '“We’ve been heavily involved in tracking this for the past year. It’s going to increase the cost of fuel,” said Glen Kedzie, vice president and energy and environmental counsel for the American Trucking Association, which represents more than 800 trucking fleets. “You will not come across any study that says this will make fuel prices cheaper. The fact is we’re kind of shifting the dynamics of who is competing for the middle blend of distillates. You’re kind of pushing another industry into that sector that includes heating oil, jet fuel and transportation fuel.”', 'By extension, that means that businesses that use these fuels — from airlines to container shippers to farmers and trucking firms — will pay higher prices and could potentially pass along any price hikes to consumers. It’s also conceivable that refineries could replace some of their gasoline production with marine fuel, if prices go high enough, analysts say.', '“There’s enough of the new fuel. It’s never been a question of the refineries’ ability to supply the fuel. It’s really a matter of what price ships are going to have to pay for essentially diesel fuel. It’s a switch from high sulfur, low value fuel which was also sold for less,” said Kurt Barrow, IHS Vice President of Oil Markets, Midstream and Downstream. “The refiners have always been willing to provide diesel. It’s just a matter of the cost associated with that, particularly when you have a 3 million barrel overnight change. We’re going to increase crude runs. We’re going to utilize the global refinery system.”', 'Kloza said the price of truck fuel diesel at the pump could rise above $4 per gallon, from the current national average of about $2.95 per gallon. “Higher prices for diesel and for freight, for shipping by trucks, they work their way through the system and they’re passed along as inflation. When you have higher prices for diesel for a sustained amount of time, it’s not something that resonates through the population like with gasoline, but it’s something that can resonate through inflation and raise the price of goods a little bit.”', 'While the price of all fuels could rise, Goldman Sachs commodity strategists in a recent report said they do not expect a big impact on distillate prices or supply because of anticipated weaker demand for diesel from truckers and lower oil prices. They also expect more ships to add scrubbers.', 'Eric Lee, Citigroup energy analyst, however, said it’s likely fuel costs will rise, starting at the end of the year, and refiners’ margins on diesel will also rise. In one scenario, if Brent crude reaches $70 in the fourth quarter, he said diesel fuel could rise to as much as $3.35 per gallon. He said gasoline prices could also rise.', 'Joswick said the wholesale price of diesel could rise by 20 percent to 25 percent as the shipping industry changes over. “This will hit the market probably in the third quarter. Right now, it’s totally under the radar with respect to prices ... and it’s understandable. Bunker fuel is just something that makes people’s eyes glaze over,” he said.', '“Things like diesel fuel and jet fuel would go up. It’s not the 3 million barrel a day market. It’s the much larger diesel and jet fuel market,” said Joswick. “The diesel market is about 30 million barrels a day. The jet market is about 8 million barrels a day. This 3 million swing in bunker fuel will affect the 38 million and the 3 million barrels of diesel fuel it uses.”', 'Each barrel of oil that enters a refinery contains the makings for a range of fuels, the prominent one being gasoline. A certain amount is refined as high sulfur fuel and also asphalt, at the bottom of the barrel. There is the middle of the barrel, which provides the lower sulfur distillates — diesel, jet fuel and heating oil. Gasoline and lighter fuels are at the top. Kedzie said the marine fuel is from that middle tier, and could also be made by blending a higher sulfur fuel with diesel.', '“There’s a school of thought that thinks the new shipping rules will trigger a Y2K, and there’s a school of thought that thinks it will cause the next Apocalypse. I’m leaning toward quite a bit of disruption and impact on prices. It’s really going to have an impact on the vessels and what they have to use,” said Kloza. “For diesel, I think it’s going to mean that diesel prices on the coasts of the United States are going to be significantly higher than they are on the interior.”', '', 'Sulfur emissions from ships are currently very high, and Kloza said one study showed the annual emissions from one large container ship was comparable to the emissions from 10 to 15 million cars running on diesel fuel.', '“On the diesel side, I think it’s clear it’s got to prop up diesel prices so there’s the potential possibility of a spike in diesel prices next winter, and heating oil,” said Kloza. “You’re talking about rolling out a new marine fuel right in the winter of the northern hemisphere.” He added, “If that market for marine fuel is high enough, the stuff that normally gets turned into gasoline and on road diesel is going to go to the vessel market.”', 'But Citigroup’s Lee and other analysts said there could be a response from President Donald Trump if diesel or other fuels rise very much. The president has periodically lambasted OPEC for high oil prices, including in a tweet on Monday that knocked the price of crude down by three percent.', '“If you have this combination of a pick up in diesel prices, gasoline prices and shipping costs are higher, freight costs are higher and that filters through to other commodities. It’s the kind of thing the White House might be inclined to delay or push back on,” said Lee. “There will be some headline risk out of the White House, there could be other tweets that push us back late this year, early next year, as it’s an election year.”', 'While Trump could allow lax enforcement of the new regulations, ships traveling the world would still have to be in compliance if they wish to stop in other ports outside of the U.S. that are enforcing the new regulations. Analysts expect about 15 percent of the ships on the high seas to be non-compliant.', 'If fuel prices rise too much, the refining industry could be self-policing, and move quickly to provide more fuel. “My thing is the refining industry has a good track record of averting disaster. While it is concerning, I wouldn’t panic over it. There’s no greater incentive to race more production than if prices skyrocket,” said John Kilduff, partner with Again Capital.', 'The concern is that the rule change is global, and the U.S. is far from the largest user of high sulfur fuel with Singapore and Rotterdam being major bunker ports. “You’re going to have a lot of folks competing for a fixed asset, and it’s a global market,” said American Trucking Association official Kedzie. “Just because it might be refined here doesn’t mean it has to be used here. There’s no law that says any crude that’s pumped in this country or any product that’s refined in a U.S. refinery has to stay in the United States.”', 'The Coalition for American Energy Security said it believes the rule change provides a big opportunity for U.S. refined product exports and that recent analyses show the U.S. industry is on track to meet demand.', '“IMO 2020 presents an enormous economic opportunity for the U.S. energy industry and its workers to supply low-sulfur fuels to the global market. These standards give the U.S. a significant advantage over foreign oil producers whose nations haven’t made necessary infrastructure investments,” a spokesman said.', 'Ultimately, the markets should calm down, but it’s difficult to tell just how much volatility there will be and how high prices could go, with the price of crude a major mitigating factor. Joswick said the heavy sulfur fuel is from about 3 percent of the world’s oil output.', 'IHS Markit’s Barrow estimates that perhaps 600,000 barrels a day of the higher sulfur fuel will continued to be used by ships with scrubbers. “Ships can either buy this new fuel which is more expensive or they could spend a few million dollars of capital to install a scrubber. We’ve seen a significant increase in orders and installation of scrubbers starting in 2018,” he said.', '“Another 400,000 or 500,000 [barrels of bunker fuel] could be in noncompliance....Our analysis says some of the ships coming out of the ship yards will be designed with more efficient engines that use the new fuel,” he said. “Some in certain kinds of trade, particularly container vessels, those are in the future going to use LNG. Some cruise ships have put on scrubbers.”', 'Carnival, for one, said it already has scrubbers on most of its ships, and it has plans to add 11 LNG ships to its fleet over the next five years. “The Advanced Air Quality Systems (generically known as exhaust gas cleaning systems, or scrubbers) are installed on 71 of the company’s more than 100 ships and, through extensive independent testing, the systems have proven capable of outperforming low-sulfur fuel alternatives such as marine gasoil (MGO) in terms of cleaner air emissions with essentially no negative environmental impact to oceans and seas,” a spokesman said in an email.', '', 'Randal Mullett, transportation industry consultant with Mullett Strategies, said shippers will find ways to save on fuel costs.', '“They’ve indicated they’re anticipating huge increases in their costs, and perhaps there are some other implications, like they revert to slow steaming to save fuel. That has big implications on supply chain,” he said, noting cargoes could arrive days later than normal if ships slow their travel speed.', 'Some analysts say the cost to shippers could rise by a third or more if they have to switch from high sulfur fuel to low sulfur fuel.', 'Joswick said he expects U.S. refiners to easily handle the increase in marine fuel.', '“Refineries have a certain amount of flexibility and they respond to price. They all run their models to simulate how they can get the best margins,” he said. “U.S. refiners are very well positioned to do this. Refineries in Europe will be more challenged. The effect of this is price has to move [higher] for this to happen.”', 'Lee said the complex refiners along the Gulf Coast will benefit from the fuel change and they can easily respond to the demand. “The U.S. is very well positioned,” he said.', 'He said the adjustment period for the transportation industry could last a few years.', '“By 2022, into 2023, prices will have normalized and there’s a new mix of fuel use in the shipping sector. On day one, diesel demand jumps and high sulfur fuel demand drops significantly,” Lee said. “Scrubbers are being installed and refiners are building more capacity. They aren’t doing it all on day one. It’s more a slow progression.”']"

And it’s important for Apple in other countries where 5G is more mature, such as China, where Apple competes with Huawei.', 'But there’s a bear case, too. We’re in the middle of a global pandemic, and jobless claims in the U.S. jumped again on Oct. 15. Economic uncertainty could push people to hold off on buying a new phone. But Apple sold more Macs, iPads and iPhones than expected during its fiscal third quarter. So we know people were still buying gadgets in the first few months of the pandemic.', 'The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro are the first iPhones to support 5G networks. Before I talk about the phones, I should explain 5G, since carriers and Apple are using it as the key selling point. As you’ve probably heard, 5G is still in its early days, and there’s a good chance you won’t be able to use it to its full potential yet.', 'The new iPhones support all kinds of 5G, including the fastest networks in the U.S. But 5G is super confusing right now, so I’ll explain what’s going on.', 'First, the 5G speeds you see will entirely depend on where you’re using the phone. The common 5G network most people will see most often right now is sometimes faster than LTE. It can also sometimes be slower than 4G LTE. But, as long as you’re on 5G, the iPhone 12 will let you do things that earlier iPhones needed Wi-Fi for.', 'That meant FaceTime in HD, which was noticeably clearer than over LTE. It’ll also download software updates and play videos from the Apple TV app at the highest possible quality. Anyway, this is the sort of experience you should mostly expect right now if you’re covered by 5G.', 'Then there’s another flavor of faster 5G that’s still being built out but will eventually offer speeds many times faster than 4G LTE both indoors and outdoors. This is when you’ll see big differences in movie and TV show download times and when 5G will really start to matter. I think I ran into some of T-Mobile’s new network in Livingston, New Jersey, where I saw speeds about twice as fast as I did at home on slower 5G.', 'And finally there’s the really fast 5G that’s bragged about the most. Verizon is the most bullish on this, though T-Mobile and AT&T are also building it. It’s mostly in cities. I’ve tested in Manhattan on other phones when I was able to download movies and TV shows in seconds but didn’t come across it on the iPhone 12 in the New Jersey suburbs, where it has yet to roll out.', 'The fastest flavor of 5G is as finicky as it is speedy: You need to be outside and basically on the same street corner as the tower. It’ll matter one day for things that need really fast and low-latency connections, like maybe if self-driving cars ever launch and need to stop on a dime. But, for now, consider yourself lucky if you happen to have it in your backyard. Otherwise it’s a bit like a treasure hunt trying to find it, and it doesn’t matter much for most people.', 'Mostly, we’re still waiting for developers to show us what we can do with 5G. One thing I’m excited for is cloud gaming. Amazon’s new Luna service will let you stream popular console games to your iPhone, for example. Apple hasn’t yet worked out deals with Google and Microsoft to allow their competing services in their current form, though.', 'The good news is you don’t really have to worry about 5G on the iPhone. It has an auto-detect option that will use 5G most of the time but can smartly switch to 4G LTE if you’re doing something like streaming music in your pocket and it thinks 5G will hurt battery life.', 'I didn’t see this happen, since it does this when the screen isn’t on. You can always just force your phone to stay on 5G or on 4G LTE, too, in case 4G LTE is still faster where you live. (Pro tip: I use the SpeedTest app to try this. Make sure your Wi-Fi is off.)', 'So, that’s 5G. The bottom line is you don’t have to worry about it too much now, but you’ll be in a good spot in a few years once the networks are more capable.', 'The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro are more alike than the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro. I often had a hard time telling the new models apart until I looked at the cameras on the back.', 'The first thing you’ll notice on the new iPhones is the super bright and colorful screen. It’s probably one of the highlight features outside of 5G. And, this year, Apple gave the regular iPhone 12 an OLED screen, instead of the LCD panel it used on the iPhone 11.', 'It’s just way, way better than LCD and matters for things such as viewing pictures, playing games and watching movies. A scene in “Mad Max: Fury Road” where a car explodes in a dust storm really stood out, since the orange flames contrast so well against the black smoke in the sky. The stereo speakers are great for watching movies, too. They sound full and get really loud.', 'I love the new blue color I reviewed. The iPhone 12 also comes in pale green, red, black and white. It has a premium feel, and is made from glass and aluminum. I love how light it is without feeling cheap.', 'I asked Apple about the throwback design, which is similar to 2010′s iPhone 4 (and the current iPad Pro and iPad Air) with flat edges and sharper corners. Apple said it helps the phone’s durability if it drops. And while I didn’t drop the phone to find out, Apple also claims the new “Ceramic Shield” glass on the front is four times more resistant to damage from drops. The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro are more water resistant and can survive under 6 meters of water for up to 30 minutes. I don’t shower with my phones, but you could if you wanted to.', 'Most new phones have excellent cameras. Google and Samsung phones always impress me. But it comes down to personal preference, and I still prefer the pictures and videos from an iPhone.', 'I took the iPhone 12 out for a walk in the park over the weekend and loved how both the regular wide-angle and the ultra-wide-angle lenses captured lots of detail and accurate colors, from the hair on my dog Mabel to trees against a deep blue sky.', 'The front-facing selfie camera is still great, but you can see here it missed one arm of my sunglasses.', 'Apple improved pictures shot at night, too, and also offers better selfies without flash even if it’s really dark out. Sometimes they were still a little blurry, though, so get a tripod or prop your iPhone on something sturdy to avoid that. Portrait shots in the day still look the best. My dog, Mabel, for example:', 'The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro are the first phones to support recording video in “Dolby Vision” HDR. I didn’t think it was a big deal until I tried it. Video recorded in HDR at 4K and 30 frames per second looks great. Dolby Vision helped brighten areas that were otherwise washed out or dark, even in my relatively dim living room with a few table lamps. You don’t have to think about it or fiddle with settings, though, your videos will just look better. The iPhone 12 Pro supports Dolby Video HDR at 4K and a smoother 60 frames per second.', 'Battery life is great. I took the iPhone 12 off the charger at about 7:34 a.m. and it still had a 51% charge at 5 p.m. That’s with a lot of use on 5G networks and the screen at about 75% brightness. I think light users will get through more than a day of use before having to charge, though I still regularly charge my iPhone at night when I go to bed and Apple promises a full day of use. That’s impressive for such a thin phone and, if you need it, you can get up to a 50% charge in 30 minutes with a 20-watt charger.', 'Finally, the iPhone 12 feels really fast. It has a new A14 Bionic processor that helps with all sorts of things, like opening large games quicker than my iPhone 11 Pro Max to improving the photos and videos.', 'I didn’t run into anything that felt sluggish on the iPhone. Games looked about as good as they did on my iPhone 11, although developers can probably make them even better with the added graphics performance. But it’s still pretty wild how some games, like “Genshin Impact” have huge worlds with great graphics.', 'Now for some bad news.', 'There’s no plug in the box, just the cable with a new type of connector at the bottom based on USB-C. Apple says it’s doing this to cut down its carbon footprint.', 'The more cynical take: Apple’s decision not to include the plug forces you to buy a new one from the company because it has that USB-C connector, not the regular USB port you’re used to seeing on Apple’s plugs since 2007. There’s a small chance you have the necessary USB-C plug already in your house, or a computer with USB-C ports that can charge the phone. This is a great way for Apple to boost its revenue by about $20 for most iPhone 12s it sells. But it’s a bad experience for you.', 'So what should you buy so you can actually charge your new iPhone 12? I recommend you get Apple’s $20 20-watt USB-C power adapter or Anker’s similarly priced 20-watt charger from Amazon.', 'Take everything I talked about with the iPhone 12 and then add a few things and you have the iPhone 12 Pro.', 'The iPhone 12 Pro is made out of steel instead of aluminum, which is heavier but looks a bit nicer. The back is matte and doesn’t attract fingerprints like the iPhone 12.', 'There’s an extra telephoto lens that works great. It helps you zoom in without losing quality in your pictures. And speaking of pictures, the new lidar sensor helps with depth, which means even more accurate portrait shots, where the background is blurred and the subject is in focus.', 'That means you can take pictures like this wide-angle:', 'And this ultra-wide:', 'And this 2x telephoto, which you don’t get on the iPhone 12:', 'And the iPhone 12 Pro has support for portrait pictures at night, something the iPhone 12 lacks. It worked well when I tested it with a clock in my office at night. It was almost completely dark, but the iPhone still took this picture without flash:', 'It’s not perfect, though. Notice the handle of the clock is still blurry. Here’s another night portrait picture of flowers. Again, it was totally dark outside:', 'That lidar sensor does double duty for augmented reality. AR lets you drop digital objects on top of the real world.', 'Sometimes it’s really cool, like if you’re using Wayfair to buy furniture and want to know if a couch will fit in your room before you buy it.', 'The lidar sensor quickly generates a mesh map of the room you’re in, so you can accurately place a painting, drop a pool table in your kitchen or a tile swatch on the wall to see if something fits.', 'The regular iPhone 12, which doesn’t have a lidar sensor, makes you wave your phone’s camera around the room for about 10 seconds before you can plop an object down.', 'And the lidar sensor helps with accuracy for things such as measuring. I used it on a measuring tape to check its accuracy and it nailed it. This is useful if you want to use your iPhone’s measuring app to see the length, width or height of something.', 'I don’t think anyone can top Apple when it comes to video recording on a phone. The Dolby Vision HDR support I talked about on the regular iPhone 12 works at up to 60 frames per second, which means even smoother 4K recording while maintaining the really good accuracy between bright and dark parts of your scene. People who film and edit with their iPhones will dig this. Normal folks might not care about the added smoothness on the 12 Pro, but they’ll get a version of it in the regular iPhone 12, too.', 'Speaking of HDR, the screen gets a bit brighter on the iPhone 12 Pro than it does on the iPhone 12, but only when HDR is in use. So, it has a greater peak brightness when needed.', 'I didn’t see a discernible difference in battery life between the iPhone 12 and the iPhone 12 Pro, likely because they share so many of the same components. Expect all-day battery life.', 'Lastly, if you want a larger 6.7-inch screen, then you have to get the iPhone 12 Pro Max. It’ll ship in November, when the smaller iPhone 12 Mini also launches.', 'The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro use a fun new “MagSafe” magnetic accessory system. The name was first used back when Apple’s MacBook chargers had magnets that held them in place.', 'MagSafe is used for wireless charging and for sticking accessories to the back of your iPhone. The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro still work with regular wireless charging pads, but they’ll juice up twice as fast — 15 watts instead of 7.5 watts — with the MagSafe charger. It magnetically sticks to the back of the phone.', 'MagSafe works well, though I wish the charging puck didn’t slide off tables so easily. Apple partners such as Belkin are building some pretty nice stands, though, and Apple says more MagSafe products are coming.', 'Apple’s new cases work with MagSafe, too, so the wireless charging puck still attaches even if you have a case on. You can attach things like a new leather wallet to the back of the iPhone 12, though I found that the magnet wasn’t strong enough to keep the wallet on while it was sliding around in in my pocket.', 'Oh, and the MagSafe charger works with older iPhones that have wireless charging, they just don’t attach magnetically.', 'MagSafe is a fun new system. It’ll probably help drive accessory revenue even more for Apple. I’m excited to see what Apple and its partners bring in the future.', 'I think most people shopping for a phone right now should choose the iPhone 12, and I expect that will be the most popular model. It’s the one I ordered, though part of me wonders if maybe I’ll like the bigger iPhone 12 Pro Max better. We’ll see when that launches in November.', 'The iPhone 12 has great cameras, an awesome screen, excellent battery life and future-proofs you with 5G. If you want some extra camera tricks, lidar for augmented reality and better portrait photos, and a more premium design, check out the iPhone 12 Pro. If you want something smaller, maybe wait for the $699 iPhone 12 Mini. Likewise, wait for the $1,099 iPhone 12 Pro Max if you want even better zoom cameras and a bigger screen. I’m excited to check those out.', 'If you want to save money, consider the $599 iPhone 11, which is still great but doesn’t have as nice of a screen, the latest processor or 5G. This year’s iPhone SE is an awesome tiny phone if you don’t want to spend much more than $400.', 'Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube. ']"
17,"We tried the Silicon Valley shower head backed by Tim Cook, here’s what it’s like",2020-01-25T14:46:01+0000,"['A San Francisco startup named Nebia, backed by some of the biggest names in technology, released a $199 shower head this week. It promises to provide a hotter, more satisfying shower using less water than traditional models.', 'I went to their offices, disrobed and took a 10 minute shower. I’ll tell you what it’s like.', 'First, some background.', 'Nebia seems a lot like a technology company: Gabriel Parisi-Amon, its CEO and co-founder, wrangled iPhone parts in Apple’s supply chain before designing the shower head. Nebia’s based in an industrial neighborhood in San Francisco that’s packed with software startups. Its investors include some high-profile executives: Apple CEO Tim Cook, The Schmidt Family Foundation and Fitbit CEO James Park.', 'But Nebia by Moen, which launched this week, is not digital technology. There’s no chip, no app and no software.', 'Instead, Nebia is a bet that non-software companies can combine product design techniques borrowed from some of the Valley’s most iconic firms with the marketing and online sales practices used by other tech-adjacent companies to sell products in stodgy sectors like mattresses, suitcases and now, plumbing fixtures.', '“When you’re making a new product, you have to look at it with a blank slate and an open mind,” co-founder and chief marketing officer Phillip Winter said.', 'When Nebia was building prototypes of its shower heads, Parisi-Amon said it discovered that a 3D printer produced special nozzles faster than a supplier could ship them. This allowed for more frequent tests, more data and a faster development process.', 'The founders are aware they’re selling a physical product that needs to be manufactured, warehoused, and shipped. Unlike software, you can’t produce another physical unit for free, so the margins are lower. And while the startup was founded in 2014, shortly after Google bought Nest and spurred a wave of investment in technology hardware companies, the sector has cooled. Investment in the sector declined during the last three years, according to Crunchbase.', 'Winter told CNBC that his firm sold 20,000 units of its Nebia Spa Shower model, which launched in 2015 for $500. But unit sales are likely to increase. In the past two years, Nebia forged a partnership with Moen, a major Ohio-based designer of faucets and fixtures, which teamed with the startup to develop and produce the Nebia by Moen', 'The Nebia shower that head launched this week ships in May, is Moen-branded and costs $200. It’ll be available in home improvement stores later this year.', 'I went to their offices, disrobed and took a 10 minute shower to see what it was like.', 'Nebia’s founders say that getting investors under the shower is their key to getting so many big-name people on board.', 'The company built a private shower inside what used to be a server closet in its loft office in San Francisco and encourages prospective employees, investors, and journalists like me to try it out. It can be awkward, Parisi-Amon said, but people who become involved with the startup nearly always accept the shower.', 'Cook invested after he tried a prototype at a Silicon Valley gym, Winter said. He became the company’s first investor and has provided ongoing support. Moen signed on board after executives found the shower reminded them of a Tesla.', 'It’s not a typical shower — it mists water instead of dumping it on you. Parisi-Amon recommended letting it run and mist for up to a minute before getting in. Low heat is a common complaint with so-called “low flow” showers. I was able to adjust the angle and height of the shower head, bringing it closer to my head for a hotter, more intense shower. It was definitely warm enough for me, and I like hot showers.', 'I like the design, too. The shower head is clad in aluminum, like a MacBook or iPhone, and it has thoughtful touches, like a magnetic mount for a detachable shower hose. The part where the water comes out of is a graceful, curved loop, with six different jets that spray mist. It looks premium.', '$200 or $500 seems like a lot to spend on a plumbing fixture when hardware stores sell comparable products for as little as $20 or less, though those are typically mostly made of plastic. Winter says the cost doesn’t seem as high when you consider that water costs money, and the Nebia product uses less water than competitors.', '“The payback period is fast,” Winter said. “A family of four in NYC will be paid back in less than a year,” he said of the savings.', 'For now, even after the partnership with Moen, Nebia is launching its newest shower head on Kickstarter. It believes Kickstarter customers give detailed feedback and will provide cash flow benefits to the company. The company’s not profitable yet but sees breaking even as an important short-term goal, Parisi-Amon said.', 'A previous version of this story misattributed The Schmidt Family Foundation’s investment in Nebia.

18,Regent is making a flying electric ferry with a top speed of 180 miles per hour,2021-04-20T22:02:21+0000,"['A Boston start-up called Regent wants to make flying ferries the best way to travel between coastal cities.', 'The start-up is developing an “electric seaglider” that can motor out of a harbor on a hydrofoil, take off at a low speed using the water as a runway, then fly over the waves at a top speed of 180 miles per hour to bring passengers to their destinations, according to co-founders CEO Billy Thalheimer and CTO Michael Klinker.', 'The duo previously worked for a Boeing company, Aurora Flight Sciences, and both are FAA-licensed private pilots. Thalheimer told CNBC that Regent wants to make trips between coastal cities fast, safe, affordable and reliable with the smallest possible environmental footprint. (The company’s name is an acronym for Regional Electric Ground Effect Naval Transport.)', 'The seagliders that Regent designed technically fall in the category of Wing in Ground Effect craft, or WIGs. They have not historically been regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration, but instead by the U.S. Coast Guard.', 'Importantly, Regent is developing its seagliders to work with existing harbor infrastructure, the CEO says. He notes that charging is still needed at harbors for mainstream adoption of electric vehicles there, whether electric air taxis, boats or ground vehicles.', 'The company will seek to establish passenger routes between major hubs like Boston and New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, or shorter routes like New York City to the Hamptons or routes connecting the islands of Hawaii.', 'But for now, with $9 million in fresh seed funding in hand, the start-up is focusing on a prototype.', '“We’re going to be flying a quarter-scale prototype by the end of this year,” said Thalheimer. “The prototype will have about a 15-foot wingspan, and will weigh about 400 pounds. We need to make sure it works in representative operational environments, like in waves and different weather.”', 'The company is expecting to do its first flight in the Boston area, but is shopping around for someplace to conduct testing elsewhere during the harsh New England winters.', 'Unlike prior generations in tech, Thalheimer says, working on a start-up that deals in atoms not just bits and bytes is easier than ever. Regent is following the success of robotics and electric vehicle companies like Kiva Robotics, Tesla, DJI and others.', '“Investors were excited about this. And we’re hearing from a lot of cities saying come here, and we’ll help you,” Thalheimer said. “We think the Boston culture is helping us today. We’re in the MIT, Harvard ecosystem. And we have great connections and in the robotics and aerospace scene here.” (Among other things, Boston is home to companies like Raytheon and Draper Laboratory.)', 'Investors in Regent’s flying ferry business include Caffeinated Capital, an early backer of supersonic jet startup Boom, Mark Cuban, Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, Y Combinator and others.', 'Caffeinated Capital founder Raymond Tonsing said he sees Regent embodying the future of electric aircraft, with super fast ferry service even potentially competing with autos someday.', '“Basically, we’re in a transition away from using fossil fuels to get from A to B, including when you’re not touching the ground. And you know? This is a massive market, and I think Regent has a very good plan to be flying passengers in about a 4-year period.”', 'The relatively quick go-to-market plan exists in no small part because the company expects to deal with the rules and regulations that govern maritime vessels, not airplanes, Tonsing explained.', 'It takes longer to get a new jet plane approved to fly passengers. While safety is still paramount, a WIG will fly in lower air space, over waves. It’s not meant to fly over towns, homes and roads.', 'Investor Mark Cuban also said in an e-mail sent to CNBC, “Time is the most valuable asset that we don’t own. Regent makes so many difficult trips simple and fast. Its impact will be significant and global.”', 'While there isn’t a crush of competition developing electric seagliders for passengers like Regent is, there are some electric and hybrid-electric watercraft businesses that could vie for similar contracts, or funding in the future.', 'These companies include other WIG developers Flying Ship Company and RDC Aqualines, along with electric vehicle boat makers such as Pure Watercraft in Seattle, Switzerland-based Candela, and the Wellington Electric Boat Building Company in New Zealand.']"

And while they showed signs of pain as the coronavirus pandemic took hold on most of the world in March, investors still rewarded them for their resilience in the current economic downturn.', 'Facebook shares popped as much as 10% following its earnings report last week. Google’s parent company Alphabet was up 7%. Netflix reported nearly double the amount of new subscribers it had anticipated for the quarter. Apple made up for of its lost iPhone sales with digital services like App Store sales and subscriptions. ', 'The only sour spot in Big Tech’s earnings came from Amazon, which posted less profit than anticipated as it continues to spend heavily to combat the effects of the pandemic on its shipping and logistics network.', 'The so-called FAANG stocks (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google/Alphabet), have proven to be far stronger than other industries ravaged by the pandemic. The stay-at-home orders across the world have people using technology to work remotely more than ever, providing a big boost and more optimism around technology. ', 'And don’t sleep on Microsoft, which is often left out of the Big Tech conversation. It reported a 15% sales jump for last quarter, and is now the most valuable publicly traded company in the world.', 'Compare all that to the various other industries that have been gutted by the coronavirus. Over the weekend, Warren Buffett delivered the devastating news that he sold off Berkshire Hathaway’s shares in the four major airlines, for example. Retailers like Macy’s and JCPenney, which were struggling before the pandemic, are knocking on death’s door. ', 'But Big Tech, which has expanded beyond making popular gizmos and gadgets to building the digital infrastructure the world needs to weather an unprecedented economic shut down, is looking stronger than ever.', 'Here’s what we learned.', 'Facebook, Google and Apple all reported sales slumps for the month of March, but all three companies said the first few weeks of April showed signs of “stability” and possible recovery. In the digital advertising world, Facebook and Google both said sales saw steep declines in mid-March, but started to stabilize in April. Those comments excited investors, sending the stocks even higher.', 'Apple also said April was looking better. Its sales took a hit earlier than Facebook and Google due to Apple’s exposure in China, which went under lockdown months before the U.S. and the rest of the world. But CEO Tim Cook told CNBC Thursday that was starting to change.', '“There was a significant, very steep fall-off in February. That began to recover some in March, and we’ve seen further recovery in April. So, it leaves us room for optimism,” Cook said in an interview with CNBC’s Josh Lipton last week. ', 'Even as industries like travel drastically scale back on advertising, tech platforms that rely on digital advertising have found a new bright spot: Direct Response (DR) ads that drive people to make a purchase or download an app. Facebook, Google and Snap all pointed to DR ads as a bright spot amid a broader slump in advertising spend. Snap in particular seems in a great position to take advantage of the trend, and its stock was up 36% the day after it reported earnings.', 'But it was a different story for Twitter, which has had difficulty beefing up the tech infrastructure it needs for DR ads. Twitter also failed to show the same signs of recovery in April that Facebook and Google did, which punished the stock last week.', 'You don’t see the term “guesswork” too often in earnings reports, but that’s exactly what we heard from Netflix when it reported earnings earlier in April. Netflix attributed the unexpected surge in new subscribers to people staying at home under shelter-in-place orders, but noted that it would be difficult to determine if that growth will continue as the economy starts to reopen and people get out more.', 'That theme was also echoed by Google and Facebook.

Apple alone said it’d buy back $50 billion more of its shares.', 'But unlike companies in other sectors that have spent the last few years buying back massive amounts of shares instead of saving that cash for a downturn, Google and Apple still have plenty of cash on hand to justify their buyback programs. Plus, they’re not laying off or furloughing workers, and they’re not asking the government for loans. It’s hard to make an argument against Google and Apple’s buybacks given how well positioned they still are to make it through the coronavirus pandemic.', 'Apple was the first major tech company to issue a formal warning on its earnings due to the coronavirus pandemic, which shut down most of China early in the year. In its revised guidance in February, Apple said it saw decreased demand and hangups in its supply chain.', 'But despite a 7.5% decline in revenue from China last quarter, Apple said it was able to make up for it thanks to a spike in sales of digital services like Apple Music subscriptions and App Store sales.', 'Apple has massive exposure in China, relying on the country to manufacture its product and boost its sales. The company has spent the last year and change rebuilding its China business, and was able to stave off a major downturn despite the effects of the pandemic. Meanwhile, Apple Stores in China are already open again, and the country will likely serve as a blueprint for Apple as it reopens stores in the U.S. and beyond.', 'Amazon is famous for reinvesting profits back into the company, but in recent years it’s shown an ability to regularly post strong quarterly profits thanks to its cloud division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which booked more than $10 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time.', 'But Amazon sees the pandemic as an opportunity, not a time to retreat.', 'Amazon warned in its earnings release last week that it plans to reinvest an expected $4 billion in profit this quarter into its Covid-19 response, which includes beefing up its delivery network to get it back to normal and provide Covid-19 testing for employees so they can safely return to work.

34,Kohl’s is building a legion of loyal shoppers,2015-12-11T12:00:00+0000,"['  At a time when shoppers have more options than ever, Kohl’s is  placing a wager that one set of customers can help revive its  sales: Its loyalists.', '  The discount department store, which outperformed Macy’s during the third quarter, is hoping to  ride its momentum into the critical holiday shopping period,  which accounted for one-third of its sales last year.', '  There are several winds at the retailer’s back. For one, it’s the  first holiday season in which its shoppers can pick  up their online orders in-store, a tactic that’s led to additional purchases 25 percent of the time.', '  It’s also the first Christmas that its new loyalty program has  been rolled out in earnest, with more than 34 million shoppers  now enlisted. By combining this initiative and its Kohl’s charge card  memberships, the retailer is using customer data to provide shoppers with more  relevant promotions and store visits, to encourage future purchases. ', 'But while analysts are optimistic about the strategic moves  Kohl’s is making, they’re not yet convinced it will be enough  to combat an influx of inventory in the sector, or a general  slowdown among department stores.', '  Though Kohl’s reiterated last month that it expects to earn  between $4.40 and $4.60 this year, consensus estimates trail  that forecast, at $4.31, according to Thomson Reuters. ', '  “Over the last 12 months, management has admirably bitten the  bullet to focus on change initiatives,” Evercore ISI analyst Omar  Saad said. “However, we believe these efforts may not be enough  to counter balance the falling tide.”', '  Kohl’s has offered a store-branded charge card since the 1970s.  But only recently did it realize the “fertile ground” of data  that could be mined from analyzing customers’ purchase behaviors, said  Will Setliff, Kohl’s executive vice president of marketing.', '  To capture insights from even more shoppers, the retailer decided to introduce a  tender-agnostic loyalty program, called Yes2You. Since launching nationally last  October, Kohl’s has more than tripled its membership base from the roughly 10 million it had during testing; it’s also doubled its email database.', 'Combined with the information from its credit customers, the company is now able to  track 80 percent of its purchases to known shoppers  — numbers typically reserved for the likes of grocery stores or  pharmacies, which can receive multiple visits from a shopper each week.', '  “The amount of customer data we have has just absolutely  exploded,” Setliff said.', '  The more frequently members shop with Kohl’s, the more the  company learns about their behavior. That means if someone consistently purchases young girls’ clothing, Kohl’s can send  them emails when it launches a new toy property that would appeal to a child around that age.', '  It can also pool customer analytics by location, to make its floorsets match the wants of customers who shop there. In the Northeast, for example, its exclusive Jennifer Lopez line is more popular than in other parts of the country.', 'Setliff said one of the biggest challenges the retailer faces is converting  new shoppers into returning visitors. To do so, his team looks at the  customer’s initial purchase behavior, and offers additional incentives to get them to come back.', '  “If a new customer doesn’t shop again within 30 days, they’ll  lapse pretty much permanently,” he said. “We have a very short  window to give them a reason to come back to the store.”', 'Once Kohl’s has built rapport with a shopper, the next step is  getting them to enroll in a store-branded charge card. Credit consumers are crucial to the company’s sales performance, as they account for a whopping 60 percent of its $19  billion in annual revenue. ', 'Converting loyalty members into credit customers remains a huge opportunity for  Kohl’s, as more than half of its loyalty members do not yet have  a charge card, according to Stifel Nicolaus. ', '  To encourage more sign-ups, the company is now prescreening  shoppers to see if they meet the requirements to qualify. Kohl’s  then tells shoppers what type of discounts they could receive as a member.', '  In an effort to further build allegiance to its stores, the retailer has integrated its loyalty program into the updated Kohl’s mobile app,  providing customers with a wallet where they can see their  rewards and other offers. Then, by scanning an item’s bar code,  shoppers can see not only the initial price tag, but how much it  would ultimately cost them. ', '  The majority of the 9 million people who have downloaded the  retailer’s app use it to view their wallet, or to see how many  reward points they have, said Krista Berry, chief digital  officer of Kohl’s.', '  Mark Taylor, an expert on digital customer experience at  Capgemini Consulting, said the team at Kohl’s is applying  “interesting techniques” to build customer loyalty. He emphasized  that for loyalty programs in general to truly engage with  customers, they need to offer more than purchase-based rewards.', '  Some examples of what Taylor considers best practices —  including rewarding customers for interacting with the brand on  social media, or creating a central place to house all of their interactions with the retailer — are being  employed by Kohl’s.', '  “They’ve really made some tremendous strides,” Taylor said. ', '  Kohl’s isn’t just relying on a robust loyalty program to help  capture more sales. Other initiatives include the rollout of an expanded beauty department to its entire fleet. Because beauty items  by their nature need to be replenished, these departments have  helped increase the number of visits to its stores as well as  the number of items a shopper has placed in their basket.', '  Kohl’s also rolled out a more extensive activewear selection,  including a built-out presence for Nike and Columbia. Along those lines, it’s also  increased the amount of space dedicated to national brands, which  help it attract new customers.', 'Of all the changes it’s made, Setliff and Berry agreed that the biggest game changer for Kohl’s  this holiday season is that shoppers can now pick up their  online orders in any of its 1,000-plus stores. ', 'Over the Black  Friday and Cyber Week shopping period, the company said roughly a  quarter of Kohls.com purchases were fulfilled by stores, either  via customer pickup or the retailer shipping the order from a  store’s inventory.', '  Berry added that the week of Thanksgiving, the retailer had four  record days on digital that were “not even remotely close to last year.”', '  “We’re off to an amazing start for holiday,” she said.', '  According to Cowen and Co. analyst Oliver Chen, there are several external factors driving Kohl’s outperformance of one of its key  competitors, Macy’s. These include an added emphasis on activewear, its lack of dependence on tourism, and less exposure to slowing brands such as Michael Kors and Ralph Lauren.', '  Still, some analysts are hesitant that Kohl’s initiatives will be  enough to offset an overabundance of inventory throughout the  retail sector, and shrinking sales among the department store  set. Whereas department stores in October 2005 generated $18  billion in sales, according to the Commerce Department, they  pulled in just $14 billion during the same month in 2015.', '  For Kohl’s specifically, revenues have remained stationary,  coming in at roughly $19 billion for the past several years.', 'Stifel Nicolaus analyst Richard Jaffe, who has a “buy” rating on  Kohl’s, said he’s optimistic about the company’s performance  during the fourth quarter.', '  “The company’s strategic initiatives that were put in place over  the last year continue to play out favorably,” he said. “We  anticipate a continuation of positive [comparable sales] and are encouraged  for holiday.”']"

At the company’s most recent annual shareholder meeting, Musk blamed ongoing delays on a need for more testing.', '“There’s only so much accelerated life testing that you do on a roof.

Hatch has led Bessemer’s investment in several space companies, sitting on the board of Rocket Lab and satellite company Spire Global, among others.', 'As both aerospace giants and private capital continue to invest billions of dollars in new technologies and opportunities, public investors should know the biggest players in the space business.', 'This is your guide to investing in space right now, with insight on the top space companies from analysts and investors.', 'Shannon Saccocia, chief investment officer at Boston Private, told CNBC she recognizes the space industry is largely government-driven at the moment and is looking for more companies to come to market.', '“I think that space is more than just a government-funded pursuit; it needs to be more of a privatized venture. My hope is that this will fund some additional social impact,” Saccocia said. “There is a desire for this to be treated more as an opportunity for companies to benefit the social good, rather than something that needs to be protected from a national security perspective, which I still think that space falls into that paradigm.”', 'There are a number of ways to categorize space companies, as the industry bleeds over into a variety of other sectors. For the purpose of this guide, CNBC simplifies investor opportunities into four categories: Human spaceflight, national security, satellite communications, and imagery and data analysis.', 'Additionally, each of those categories includes three different types of companies: Public companies that are purely space-focused, public companies with exposure through a significant space subsidiary and private companies that soon may either go public or spin off divisions.', 'Here’s what you need to know.', '', 'While Boeing and Lockheed Martin both have legacies in human spaceflight, Virgin Galactic is the first publicly traded company focused on flying people to space as its primary business.

Virgin Galactic recently announced an investment from Boeing, as the venture is looking at whether it can mature its space tourism technology and build rockets capable of point-to-point high-speed travel.', '“The thing to note about space is that the feedback cycle is a bit longer,” Hatch said. “While that might take a bit longer, I do think it will have the same return on your investment as a software company.”', 'Neither SpaceX nor Blue Origin plan to go public any time soon. But it would be a mistake to miss the impact the companies of Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos have had on the industry. SpaceX has become the most active U.S. rocket launcher, significantly reducing the cost of launching satellites while also proving it can reuse the most valuable parts of rockets by landing the boosters. SpaceX has also been working on a capsule known as Crew Dragon, aiming to begin launching astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA next year.', 'Although Blue Origin has yet to fly people, the company has taken what it’s learned from its space tourism program and applied it to a variety of ambitious spaceflight endeavors: Developing a powerful yet reusable rocket engine, building a massive new rocket and leading a bid to fly cargo and people to the moon for NASA on a lunar lander.', 'Lockheed Martin joined Blue Origin’s lunar lander initiative and has also been building the Orion capsules for NASA’s deep space missions. NASA has already committed to buying six Orion spacecraft from Lockheed Martin for a minimum of $4.6 billion — and the agency may plunk down even more money in the future.', 'Boeing, like SpaceX, is developing a capsule to fly NASA astronauts to the space station.

DISH used to be a service provided by EchoStar, another company on this list that provides several communications services beyond just broadcast television.', 'ViaSat, Intelsat and Loral Space & Communications each focuses on broadband services, including internet, via large satellites that orbit in a fixed position but far away from the Earth, to cover as much area as possible. For example, ViaSat-1 is a seven-ton satellite that covers much of North America.', 'Iridium Communications and Globalstar both offer a variety of satellite phones and other mobile communications services. Iridium is often heralded as one of the space industry’s turnaround stories, as the company recovered from bankruptcy over a decade ago to complete its $3 billion Iridium NEXT network of satellites this past year.', 'An increasing number of satellite companies are looking to offer Internet of Things, or IoT, communication services, and ORBCOMM markets itself as one of the leading providers in that niche.

Project Kuiper would put 3,236 satellites into orbit, and the company is already building facilities on the ground through its new AWS Ground Station division.', 'OneWeb was one of the early companies pursuing an internet constellation, as the company aims to launch 650 satellites into orbit over the next two years. OneWeb has raised $3.4 billion since its inception in 2012, with investments from a wide variety of sources: Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, Mexican conglomerate Grupo Salinas, Qualcomm, the Rwandan government, Virgin Group, Coca-Cola, Airbus, Intelsat, EchoStar-owned Hughes Communications and Indian conglomerate Bharti Enterprises. According to PitchBook, OneWeb was valued at $14 billion in June 2017, during a failed acquisition attempt by Intelsat.', 'But likely the most ambitious internet constellation effort is SpaceX’s Starlink. Musk’s company has been steadily fundraising this year. Starlink would include as many as 30,000 satellites when completed and President Gwynne Shotwell claimed recently that her company’s network is far ahead of OneWeb, saying “we have far more capacity per satellite than our competitors.” SpaceX launched 60 Starlink satellites in May, expects to launch another 60 Starlink satellites next week and aims to be launching 60 every other week soon.', 'Disclosure: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com.', '', 'The last category is the smallest by total market value, but, thanks to the past decade of private investment, the imagery and data analysis category may be the fastest to grow in the coming years.', 'Essentially four space companies in one, Maxar Technologies could easily be included in either national security or satellite communications. But, having acquired DigitalGlobe in 2017, Maxar operates what it claims is “the world’s most advanced constellation” of imaging satellites.', 'Chad Anderson, CEO of small New York City firm Space Angels, told CNBC that he sees potential from companies making use of the new flood of geospatial imagery, which he described as satellites “providing information about the world around us, spatially, so we understand where things are and where they’re moving.” He compared geospatial imagery today to the development of the Global Position System, or GPS, in the late 1970s.', '“There was a lot of infrastructure investment in GPS, meaning that there was government investment into military applications, to put these satellites up and give us this new global positioning,” Anderson said.', 'Anderson explained that companies such as Trimble and Magellan created the distribution channel for GPS, unlocking the feed of data for the rest of the world. Garmin has focused on the consumer applications of GPS, through a wide variety of devices.', '“They made it accessible to the tech community, and this is where you see all of the value being generated. The founders of  didn’t have to know how satellites work ... you just have to know that signal is there and gives you this information,” Anderson said. “The GPS signals from space are incredibly valuable. The geospatial intelligence signals that we’re just starting to harness today are extremely valuable.”', 'Finally, there are several private companies focusing on different areas of imagery and data analytics. Bessemer’s Hatch called out Spire Global, Planet Labs and Orbital Insight as three “high-flying venture-backed companies” that may go public soon. Spire Global and Planet Labs each operate constellations of small satellites, with the former collecting data on things such as the weather and the latter taking regular images of the Earth’s surface. Although both companies have since raised money, Planet was valued at $2.2 billion in August 2017 and Spire Global was valued at $345 million in November 2017, according to PitchBook.', '“I’d keep an eye on those,” Hatch said.', 'Each of the investors CNBC spoke to pointed out how historically unique it is to see companies looking to profit from space. But even with the declining costs in space hardware, any business in space faces steep capital costs and high risks. As Ann Kim, managing director of Silicon Valley Bank, pointed out, Virgin Galactic shares could easily continue to be volatile until its business operations stabilize.', '“The public is buying shares in a company with ambitious plans to make space a viable destination, rather than one with a predictable business model. Investors should expect the shares to be extremely volatile due to a number of uncertainties in this market,” Kim said.', 'But that’s not to say Virgin Galactic is representative of all space companies.

According to a 2018 report from U.K. think tank Chatham House, over 4 billion metric tons of cement are produced annually. This, the policy institute said, amounted to roughly 8% of global CO2 emissions.', 'While it may have a lower carbon footprint than Portland cement, Regen GGBS remains an energy intensive product, requiring substantial amounts of electricity and natural gas.', 'According to Swansea University, the idea behind the Port Talbot project is to “replace some of the natural gas used at the plant with green hydrogen, which is considered a clean source of energy as it only emits water when burned.”', 'The unit at Hanson UK’s site generates hydrogen using electrolysis, which splits water into oxygen and hydrogen.', 'If the electricity in the process comes from a renewable source — the project in Wales makes use of on-site wind and solar installations — then the end product is dubbed “green hydrogen.”', 'The system was put together as part of the Reducing Industrial Carbon Emissions initiative, which is headed up by Swansea University’s Energy Safety Research Institute.', 'In a statement, Charlie Dunnill, a senior lecturer based at the ESRI, described cement manufacture as “one of the most energy and carbon intensive industries and therefore a perfect place to start making impacts in carbon reduction.”', 'Last week also saw the world’s largest cement company, LafargeHolcim, announce it would take part in a collaboration to “explore the development” of carbon capture and storage solutions.', 'In a statement, the business said it would “study the feasibility of capturing carbon” from two facilities, one in Europe and the other in North America, using carbon sequestration tech from Schlumberger New Energy.

A ground station is the vital link for transmitting data to-and-from satellites in orbit.', '“Satellite data is incredibly useful for building a wide range of important applications, but it is super complex and expensive to build and operate the infrastructure needed to do so,” Charlie Bell, Amazon Web Services senior vice president, said in a statement. “Today, we are giving satellite customers the ability to dynamically scale their ground station antenna use based on actual need. And, they will be able to ingest data straight into AWS, where they can securely store, analyze, and transmit products to their customers.”', 'AWS Ground Station is partnering with several satellite companies, include Spire Global, DigitalGlobe and BlackSky. Each of the companies operate ground facilities already but will work with AWS Ground Station to augment operations. Spire operates more than 30 ground stations already but expects Amazon’s platform will offer faster speeds at lower costs.', '“This offering that they’re doing is just an extension” of Amazon’s cloud service, Spire CEO Peter Platzer told CNBC. “Spire has built one of the world’s largest ground station networks ... and now imagine that Amazon does all of that and the only thing that Spire does is rents capacity on the ground station.”', 'Amazon’s facilities will be built on the infrastructure from dozens of AWS data centers located around the world, according to Platzer.', '“I wouldn’t be surprised if in five years they have hundreds of ground stations around the world,” Platzer said.', 'Spire has more than 60 “cubesat” sized satellites in orbit. The company’s satellites have multiple sensor on board, which track ships and airplanes, as well as gather atmospheric data to forecast weather. Spire describes itself as an analytics company, as a variety of industries use Spire’s data, ranging from hedge funds to earth scientists to shipping businesses.', 'AWS Ground Station would remove the heavy capital costs of building ground station networks off of satellite operators like Spire, according to Platzer. Companies like Spire would instead pay operational costs, to “rent capacity as our needs arise,” Platzer said.', '“The same way we rent compute capacity on Amazon due to need, we will now be able to rent ground station capacity to suck data from our satellites on demand as we need it,” Platzer said.', 'AWS announced a partnership with Iridium Communications in September, to develop a satellite-based network called CloudConnect for Internet of Things (IoT) applications.

53,"Building a successful start-up, brick by Lego brick",2016-08-20T21:00:00+0000,"['  In 1998 the Lego Group entered into a licensing agreement with  Lucasfilm, the company founded by “Star Wars” creator George  Lucas. It  allowed Lego to manufacture sets based on the movies, with  instructions showing builders how to turn 2,000 tiny plastic  bricks into the Death Star.', 'Fourteen years later the Walt Disney Company bought Lucasfilm  for $4 billion,  with the licensing deal still very much in place. Countless Lego  products tied in with the franchise followed, and the Lego Group  went on to manufacture sets based on other popular movie  franchises, such as “Harry Potter” and “The Avengers.”', 'Licensing is part of an overall strategy that’s made the Lego  Group wildly successful. According to its 2015 annual report, Lego Group made $1.4 billion in net profit, more than double what  it made just four years earlier. But while this is good news for  Lego, it’s created a tough situation for some consumers.', '  The Lego Group still creates sets priced well within the modest  reach of a child’s allowance, but parents who have taken their  kids to the toy store know perfectly well that there is no  appetite for a 30-piece set that can be built in five minutes.  Kids want one of the high-end sets with thousands of pieces, and  those can retail for hundreds of dollars.', '  If that were a one-time expense, parents might be willing to make  an exception, but it rarely is. Often, the child will just want  another set seconds after finishing the  last one and putting it on the shelf to be forever ignored. If  the parent relents and buys another such set in the same month,  the expense can become equal to that of a car lease payment.', '  Luckily, parents of Lego-obsessed youngsters can breathe a sigh  of relief. Netbricks, a company based in Elk Grove  Village, Illinois, offers the opportunity to rent Lego sets for a  monthly fee. There are several tiers, such as the Master plan,  which allows 60-day rentals of $400 worth of Lego sets for $49 a  month. At the end of the 60-day period, the sets are shipped  back free of charge and new sets are shipped to the  subscriber.', '  Company president Rick Weil founded it after experiencing the  same thing that so many other parents do. In other words, he was  hemorrhaging money on Legos for his kids and wondered if there  was a way to slow the bleeding.', '  “It seemed like a problem that a lot of people had,” he said. “I  figured if there’s a big enough problem, then there’s probably a  market there. … Licensing adds a fair amount to the price of  a set, and the expense of the product lent itself to the rental  business.”', 'Netbricks started selling to the public in 2015 and at launch a Groupon promotion led to an initial enroll of 5,000 people, far outpacing expectations. He said that  requests for the now-discontinued Death Star set accounted for  fully 12 percent of his initial customer requests, with the $240  Tower Bridge set taking second place.', '  “These are people who buy at a lower price point,” he said.  “Something like the Death Star is a once-a-year purchase for  these families.”', ' (Pictured: The world-famous Tower Bridge features iconic  towers, working drawbridge and a red double-decker bus. It also  includes 4,295 pieces and costs $240.)', '  Netbricks currently employs eight people, including Weil. Each  employee has a dedicated job, right down to the person who does  the all-important cleaning of the returned sets, using a  medical-grade technique that’s absolutely necessary for anyone  who considers the term “used Legos.”', '  Weil said that parents are actually far less concerned about  cooties than they are about penalty fees for lost pieces.  Netbricks assesses no charge for those.', '  “Part of our service is no charge for normal piece loss,” Weil  said, citing a range of 15 to 20 lost pieces for regular sets or  20 to 30 for larger ones. He added that the company’s real  concern is the malicious actor who “harvests” Lego sets with the  intention of selling rare pieces to desperate builders who need  that special brick to finish their creation.', '  Weil would not disclose his company’s financial information, but  he said that it’s profitable on a gross margin basis, and he  expects it to be cash-flow positive in six months’ time. He added  that he’s in no rush to see the company get ahead of itself by  expanding too quickly.', '  “We made a decision early on that although there’s more demand  out there that we can get, we didn’t want to take on a huge  volume of customers until operations are ready to scale,” he  said. “If you don’t have customer service and structure where you  can field all calls, that’s not a great way to grow a  business.”', '  Netbricks currently boasts 215 “fully active” members, which it  defines as members who have rented and returned sets for more  than one cycle. The current total is well below the 5,000  customers who signed up at launch, but Weil said that was to be  expected because of the one-time impact of the Groupon promotion.  The lower number of repeat customers is a more accurate  reflection of Lego diehards. And Weil said that Netbricks has  been successful in retaining repeat customers, so they must be  doing something right.', '  Netbricks is not allowed to buy Legos from Lego.com, because Lego  is trying to discourage resellers. Netbricks buys its entire  inventory from retailers (Walmart, Target, Toys-R-Us,  etc.). ', '“Lego is aware of what we’re doing and we’ve had a  handful of communications with them,” Weil said. “It was nothing atypical of  how a top five worldwide brand would work to protect their brand  and trademark. Anytime anybody pops up and is using the word ‘Lego’ in a commercial sense, the Lego company sends out  information and notification as to how they would like you to use  their trademarks, and that’s been the extent of our business to  business communication with Lego.”', 'Lego Group could not provide a comment by press time.', '  “We’re focused on providing an experience for big-time Lego  fans. We have a lot of respect for the Lego company  and their retail model,” Weil said.', '  — By Daniel Bukszpan, special to  CNBC.com']"

Block has also figured out the value of everything that a retailer could offer that might factor into a discount: prominent product placement on the shelf or near a store’s entrance, free catalog advertising, longer deal terms, special in-store or online promotions.', '“I always use margin requirements, but we’ll take less margin for a strategic win that helps us meet a new goal or gain efficiencies in some other way, like less marketing costs,” said Block. Her products, known as Fresh Cab (commercial) and Stay Away (her mass brand), offer a safer, more sustainable and more humane way to rid farms, homes and businesses of mice and bugs. “It’s always an open discussion — creativity grows when you have restraint.”', 'Honed over the 15 years since founding her company, Block’s negotiation techniques have helped win business with national stores like Lowe’s, Ace Hardware and Target (online). She’s grown EarthKind into a profitable $8.5 million, 30-employee entity since the discovery at her kitchen table in New Town, North Dakota, that balsam fir essential oil and ground-up corn cob repel mice effectively.', 'But there’s one Holy Grail of a customer that, despite saying it wants to sell EarthKind products, refuses to take part in Block’s negotiations: Wal-Mart Stores.', 'In 2013 Block flew to Bentonville, Arkansas, home of the retail giant, for an initial meeting with a Wal-Mart buyer (Block had hired a consultant to coach her on Wal-Mart’s average price points and profit margins). Shortly after, the retailer emailed her a purchase order, but with a catch. Block said the price at which Wal-Mart wanted to buy EarthKind was 12 percent to 15 percent less than what they had discussed in person. (That’s 12 percent to 15 percent less than Block’s lowest price for any retailer.) Then Block couldn’t get the buyer on the phone.', '“I received an email,” she recalled. ”‘That’s not in our policy to negotiate on price,’ [the buyer] said. It was disappointing.” A second email, saying the same thing, followed another unreturned phone call from Block.', 'Wal-Mart did not respond to repeated requests for comment.', 'Block decided on her bottom-line message to Wal-Mart: She wouldn’t work with the company, “not until you let me make money.”', '“I would really like to do business globally with Wal-Mart … but if they’re going to reduce the price on the shelf and use it as a loss leader, that’s bad for my brand,” the EarthKind founder said.', 'Walking away from Wal-Mart and its hundreds of millions of weekly customers would dumbfound many small-business suppliers, but it turned out to be one of the best things Block, at the time, could have done for EarthKind.', 'Stories of Wal-Mart squeezing suppliers are not new — it has, after all, built itself into the world’s largest retailer mainly by offering rock-bottom prices to lure customers, an approach that became even more important when earnings sagged in recent years. The pain that comes from working with it includes difficulty scaling and maintaining business at the level that Wal-Mart demands.', 'Even though Wal-Mart’s leverage in deals is no secret, saying no to Wal-Mart’s business isn’t something most small firms want to do. Landing the behemoth as a buyer of their goods is a dream for many suppliers, as it can swiftly lead to rocketing sales and market share. Wal-Mart’s CEO, Doug McDillon, boasts on the company’s web site, “For our suppliers, working with Wal-Mart means access to the 260 million customers who shop our stores around the world each week.” ', 'More from iCONIC:  Business lessons that fueled Reed Hastings’ 20-year $60 billion Netflix run   A booming start-up center north of the border is rivaling Silicon Valley   Lending gap or not, women are beating out men 5 to 1 in this booming sector', 'Reaching even a small percentage of Wal-Mart shoppers would have been a good step in growth for EarthKind, which has just only started to break into mainstream, big-box retail. Its first customers, whom Block persuaded to try free samples of the solution she came up with by trial and error, were farmers and equipment dealers near her family’s farm in New Town, North Dakota. “Farmers hate getting ripped off. They’re cheap in that respect,” Block said.', 'The idea for the product came to Block during the early 2000s, at a time when she was looking to subsidize her family’s $30,000-a-year farm income. One day while driving her truck, a mouse ran up her leg. After warding it off with perfume, she did some research. She found that 98 percent of the then-$100 million mice-control market was made up of poison-based products. By calling around to farm-supply stories, she also estimated that U.S. farmers lose roughly $8 million a year in farm equipment damage caused by pests.', 'Block handed out the initial samples in the fall of 2002.', '“I was also looking at human behavior. [Farmers] aren’t going to take the time to hang something up or do anything extra; they were tossing in a bag of poison, so they might as well try this pouch,” Block said.', 'By February of the next year, most of the trial clients were happy. “They didn’t have to clean up dead bodies; they didn’t have to worry about poisoning their dogs,” Block said.', 'Sales grew incrementally as EarthKind picked up more equipment dealers including her local John Deere, but then Block hit a roadblock. Her brand had just received some local press, and an Environmental Protection Agency representative sought her out at a tradeshow to tell her that any product being sold to control pests needs a license, a process that could cost up to $2 million.', '″[The rep] recommended that I not go through with it, but I made up my mind — my product had to come out because we just keep killing things, it goes against nature.” Block said. “If I grew to have 2 percent of the market, that’s a good little business.”', 'It took Block about four years of back-and-forth with the EPA and about $200,000 — much of which came from grants, the selling of her beloved pack horse and camper, and income selling produce — to finally get her license. She officially launched EarthKind in 2007, and on the backs of John Deere (her first national account) and a small army of farmers, she was able to work her way into RV and marine dealers. It took three years to get a callback from Menards, the Eau Claire, Wisconsin-based home improvement chain with about 300 stores in the Midwest. Dealing with Menards foreshadowed the experience she’d go through with bigger chains. It wanted a lower price, and it wanted her to change her brown-box packaging to a plastic clamshell.', '“They said, ‘If you manufacture it in China, you’ll get the price down to where you’re going to sell it,’” Block recalled. “That defeats the whole purpose of growing a business using U.S. agricultural products that are environmentally-friendly, too.”', 'Block eventually hooked Menards on another idea, a store locator service technology on EarthKind.com that lets customers see which stores are selling non-poison pest control.', '“I went back into their office and showed that we’ve got 30,000 customers in their area who would buy our product in your store if you had it,” she said. Menards was impressed, and after a heated price negotiation — Block left the room when the buyer wanted a price lower than her walk-away limit — the retailer bit. Today, the retailer is one of EarthKind’s most consistent buyers.', 'IRI, a Chicago-based market research firm, estimates that year-over-year retail sales for the overall pest-control market — which includes chemical products and devices intended to kill insects and rodents — was almost $800 million as of late December 2016, up 5.5 percent from the previous year.', 'Unlike most of the poison-based products, 90 percent of this sector, EarthKind’s are safe to use around food, children and pets. Driven by consumer demand in other industries as well, the all-natural category is growing. Sixty-one percent of pest-control users polled prefer to use natural, non-chemical alternatives, according to a recent Mintel Group research report.', 'This is what eventually led Lowe’s, the world’s second-largest home improvement chain, to strike up a deal with EarthKind two years ago, after meeting Block at a woman business owner-focused tradeshow. Lowe’s had conducted some surveys and found that customers were asking for all-natural options for things like herbicides and pesticides. Lowes was impressed with EarthKind’s history selling to the agricultural industry, and after some trial and error on new packaging and price negotiations, Lowe’s placed EarthKind’s Stay Away in a prime spot in 350 of its stores.', '“Her products do really well,” said Jason Miller, Lowe’s merchandising director for lawn and garden. “We were happy with the accretive sales it has produced; it didn’t steal from the category.” In December, Lowe’s extended its deal with EarthKind to place its products in 1,700 of its stores, a program that will extend into April.', 'The Lowe’s business is indicative of how EarthKind has grown over the past year. Sales to hardware stores and farm/home stores grew 51.5 percent and 44 percent respectively, while new sales to grocery stores and lawn and garden stores grew 695 percent.', 'Lowe’s also illustrates the type of partnership that Block says is integral to growing her firm the way she wants. The back and forth she carries out with such retailers — price negotiations almost always follow each big new order — is typical of what analysts call a good relationship between vendor and buyer. “Key vendor relationships with retailers are very collaborative and not adversarial,” said Charlie O’Shea, a senior analyst at Moody’s who covers large retail. “It may get down to the nitty-gritty on price every so often, but it’s hard for a large retailer to flip a switch and replace a key vendor.”', 'While accepting the deal (sans negotiation) with Wal-Mart would have definitely boosted EarthKind’s revenue, it would have strained the firm on a few different levels. “We didn’t have the infrastructure to support the customer — I didn’t want my people focusing on one customer solely. … Such a big [account] ends up risking the report cards with others,” Block said, who decided early on that no single retailer would make up more than 15 percent of EarthKind’s business. (Lowe’s made up 15 percent of the firm’s sales last year.)', 'Settling on a lower price with Wal-Mart could have also impacted deal-making with everyone else. “All of a sudden my negotiation in that room [with another retailer] becomes much more difficult if they throw the Walmart [price] up,” she said.', 'There was also the fear that Wal-Mart’s lower price may have eroded EarthKind’s profit margins and hindered Block’s growth plan. That plan includes sourcing American-grown raw materials from family farms, manufacturing stateside, keeping a low carbon footprint, and investing in a workforce of which 20 percent is made up of developmentally-disadvantaged workers, who help with packaging. She also provides 100 percent paid health care, vacation packages and bonuses for all employees based on company growth and profitability.', 'While a deal with Wal-Mart won’t happen until Block can facilitate a more involved price debate, she’s slowly ramping up operations so EarthKind can handle other big retail brands — maybe Target and Costco — in the next year or so. In 2015, she moved manufacturing from North Dakota to North Carolina so she could ship product quickly and more cost-effectively to retailers. Last year, she added robotics to the plant floor. She has also hired three executives to fill out her leadership team.', 'One indirect way to finding more big customers — and another possible way into Wal-Mart and Target — is via Burt’s Bees, the all-natural skincare line owned by The Clorox Company that Wal-Mart already sells. EarthKind is an inaugural member of Burt’s Bees Launchpad, an annual grant program that helps start-ups operating in the all-natural health and well-being market. Through the contacts she’s made in the program, Block recently toured the Burt’s Bees factory, where she picked up ideas on how to reward and motivate employees.', 'Block is also mentoring a Burt’s Bees sales planner, who previously ran the firm’s business with Target. “We’ve not been able to get into Target stores — they own the moms and millennials market,” Block said.', 'Meanwhile, Block has no regrets about playing hard-Moneyball with the world’s biggest retailer: “Saying no to Wal-Mart allowed us to make sure we have good execution with our other customers,” she said. “And it doesn’t break their hearts when you say no to their competitors.”', '— Maggie Overfelt, special to CNBC.com ']"

63,Think running retail stores is more expensive than selling online? Think again.,2017-04-19T18:28:38+0000,"['Conventional wisdom suggests that running retail stores is more expensive than selling the same merchandise online.', 'Conventional wisdom is wrong.', 'It may also seem that using existing retail stores as mini-distribution centers to fulfill online orders for shoppers is a less expensive option than full-fledged distribution centers.', 'But in actuality, it’s typically the most expensive option.', 'As more and more shopping shifts online, retailers are working hard to capture the sale, no matter the cost. But when it comes to profitability, an online sale is not an equivalent replacement for that same item purchased in store.', 'Retail consultancy AlixPartners built models for CNBC to illustrate an approximation of the financial differences an apparel retailer might see when selling $100 worth of goods in-store and the same $100 worth of goods online.', 'Buy in-store', 'The AlixPartners models begin with a typical $100 clothing purchase made by a shopper in a physical store, with a typical cost of goods sold — or what the retailer paid to have that clothing manufactured — of about $40.', 'Then, there is the cost of running stores, but because those costs are considered “legacy” costs — and have been in place for many years — there’s a maturity and scale to them, making them more efficient, and less “expensive” relatively, than the cost of running online operations.', 'In a physical retail store, a shopper, effectively, picks out her own merchandise, and gets it home herself, so there’s no additional “picking, packing, shipping” cost paid by a retailer with this model.', 'Thus the $100 outfit has associated operating costs, like rent, overhead and labor of about $28.', 'So a $100 purchase, minus the $40 cost of the goods, minus the $28 operating costs associated with that unit of clothing, leaves a profit margin of 32 percent.', 'Buy online, ship from distribution center', 'Now, consider a shopper instead goes to a retailer’s website to search for and buy that same $100 outfit, with the same $40 cost. The model assumes that the $100 purchase comes with free shipping, which is fairly typical for a purchase of that value.', 'There are costs associated with processing an online order. In this case, it has to be picked, packed and shipped to the shopper from a distribution center.', 'It’s much more expensive on a per item basis, for a retailer to ship individual orders, one at a time, from fulfillment centers to consumers’ homes, than it is to send a truckload of inventory from a distribution center to a store.', 'So, for the retailer, the clothing shipped from a distribution center would have associated operating costs of $30, slightly more than the in-store operating costs.', 'The higher operating costs in this model result from distribution costs that can be four times higher, and overhead and infrastructure costs that can be three times more than an in-store model.', '“Overhead and infrastructure cost is where strategy comes into play,” explained Pete Madden, a director at AlixPartners. “A retailer has to make decisions. Do I own my [distribution center]? Do I pay a third party to do it for me? The cost for certain corporate functions, associated with running distribution centers like IT and marketing, can be in the tens of millions of dollars in terms of investment.”', 'There’s also the investment to build and manage websites, apps, distribution centers, and establish shipping networks or partnerships to fulfill those orders.', 'Online operations also have other incremental costs when it comes to acquiring and then taking care of customers, Madden said. A retailer needs systems to help shoppers with order management and tracking, and to show them where inventory may be available (i.e., online only, or available in certain stores). Plus there’s a cost to manage the complexity of the “endless aisle” online, logistics and IT coordination with shipping vendors like FedEx and UPS, and increased marketing spending for search engine optimization to drive shoppers to their websites.', '“All these costs,” said Madden, “until they slow and until online grows into a larger share of business, will continue to outpace any similar costs for legacy stores.”', 'Which means, all of it together makes a retailer’s online business much more like a start-up, with less scale leading to higher costs and lower profitability, compared to its legacy store networks.', 'Put it altogether, and AlixPartners models that the same outfit purchase made online and shipped to a consumer has a profitability breakdown as follows: $100 purchase price, minus the $40 cost of the goods, minus the $30 operating costs associated with that unit of clothing, leaving a profit margin of 30 percent.', 'Buy online, pick-up in store', 'Now that many retailers can serve shoppers both in-store and online, there are increasing instances of consumers looking for the convenience of ordering merchandise online, but picking it up in-store. In some cases, it may be faster or even more convenient for shoppers to pick-up in store, than waiting for home package delivery.', 'But, offering a “buy online pickup in store” option, means a retailer is paying to operate both channels. So when breaking down the operating cost to fulfill that order, you have to account for all the aforementioned operating costs of running both channels.', 'So that same $100 outfit that cost the retailer $40 to buy, now comes with associated operating costs of $37 dollars spread over both the store and web operations, leaving an operating a profit margin of 23 percent.', 'Buy online, ship from store', 'Leveraging stores as distribution centers sounds like an efficient, lower cost option. But it’s not.', 'It’s true that in many cases, stores are considerably closer, geographically, to shoppers than distribution centers, which are often located in less populated areas.', 'But, using stores as distribution centers is the least profitable model.', 'The main reason for the compressed profitability is the cost of double-shipping merchandise.', 'But the retailer would do this if it means keeping a shopper happy by getting that shopper merchandise faster.', 'As a retailer, you are operating two channels, and shipping that merchandise twice, to fulfill an order placed online but shipped to a consumer from a store. Generally, store merchandise gets there by the semi-truckload, so a retailer has paid for that distribution cost once.', 'Then, if an order placed online is fulfilled from store merchandise, employees at the store have to pick, pack, and ship individual orders to a shopper’s home.', 'Not only has that same outfit now shipped twice, at the retailer’s expense, but the “last mile” or the final leg of the delivery journey is far by the most expensive.', 'So back to our example. The $100 outfit, with a $40 cost, now has associated operating costs of $48 when ordered online but shipped from a store, leaving a profit margin of 12 percent, a full 20 percentage points lower than a pure in-store sale.', 'The cost of returns', 'AlixPartners explains that the cost of returns is not discussed in the models as it’s very difficult to factor in numerically, but it is critical to understand, as it’s especially costly for online purchases.', 'Clothing items bought online are returned three times more than items bought in-store on average. But processing those online returns can be six times more expensive compared to in-store.', 'Industry standard suggests 30 to 40 percent of all clothing bought online ultimately gets returned. This makes sense given it’s very hard to know how clothing will fit and feel without seeing it in person first. Plus, consider that many consumers may order the same clothing item in several sizes or colors online, only ever intending to keep one.', 'So, if the items are shipped for free to the shopper, and returned at no cost to the shopper, that leaves the retailer absorbing shipping costs both ways on up to 40 percent of all clothing items bought online.', 'But stores do offer a higher chance to recapture some profit.', 'If a retailer has a store network, like in our model examples, many consumers will choose to return in-store and then there’s a much higher chance the consumer will buy something else on that trip. Target says one-third of shoppers that pickup online orders in store buy something else.', 'An in-store return can lower the cost somewhat, since return shipping may not be paid by the retailer if the item stays in store and can be resold.', 'But, there is a cost to re-process the item, and it may end up being shipped back to a distribution center, but this time in bulk with other items. In other cases, it’s a lost sale entirely and the item counts as a loss, along with all the other returned goods that can’t be resold.', 'Making online less expensive ', 'Most retail experts think that both stores and online options give retailers the best chance for success to optimize the shopping experience. The big question is what percent of sales should come from each channel to achieve maximum profitability, and when will the industry hit that equilibrium.', 'There are a number of actions retailers can take to increase their online profit margins including growing the size of the online sales channel to scale the overhead and the investments, Madden said. Additionally, retailers should look for ways to lower shipping, or consider upping free shipping minimums. Figuring out how to lower return frequency is a big cost saver, as is encouraging shoppers to bring their online returns into stores for hopes of picking up additional sales.', 'Testing the model: J.C. Penney’s experience ', 'While the AlixPartners models will approximate the cost many apparel retailers are facing across channels, the profit margin of course will vary from retailer to retailer depending on many factors, decisions, investments and capabilities.', 'J.C. Penney said its profitability order is a little different, with in-store being the most profitable. The order online, pick up in-store option is the second most profitable, followed by order online, ship from distribution center, and lastly order online, ship from store.', 'On its fourth-quarter earnings call, J.C. Penney CEO Marvin Ellison said 77 percent of online purchases touched the store in 2016. Ellison further explained to CNBC “every time an online order touches the store, it actually helps the margin. The real pain point is the fulfillment price, it’s always cheaper to ship from a distribution facility to a store than to a consumer.”', 'So for the department store, there are two reasons the order online, pick up in store option is the second most profitable method.', 'First, J.C. Penney says when an online order is picked up in store, at least one-third of those customers will make an additional purchase in store of about $50. (Incremental sales were not captured in the AlixPartners models.)', 'Second, the same-day pick up feature uses inventory already in the store, so no shipping to store is necessary. But, the department store’s “free ship to store” feature — which takes four to seven business days and is offered free for orders over $25 — is done using Penney’s weekly delivery trucks to lower that shipping cost. Because its stores are replenished with new merchandise each week, it’s cost-effective to load that same truck with jcp.com orders that customers have chosen to pick-up in that store.', 'J.C. Penney spokeswoman Daphne Avila said that even though it’s least profitable to fulfill an online order by shipping from the store, it’s “still more advantageous to ‘save the sale’ and not disappoint a customer. In the past, we lost the sale if our distribution center couldn’t have the item in stock. Now we’re developing an enterprise-wide view of our inventory so we can better meet customer demand.”', 'Watch: Wal-Mart in talks to acquire Bonobos']"

But what I quickly came to admire about him is his resilience, born of too much struggle; his empathy, born of too much grief.

He made me a better president – and he’s got the character and the experience to make us a better country.', '“And in my friend Kamala Harris, he’s chosen an ideal partner who’s more than prepared for the job; someone who knows what it’s like to overcome barriers and who’s made a career fighting to help others live out their own American dream.', '“Along with the experience needed to get things done, Joe and Kamala have concrete policies that will turn their vision of a better, fairer, stronger country into reality.', '“They’ll get this pandemic under control, like Joe did when he helped me manage H1N1 and prevent an Ebola outbreak from reaching our shores. They’ll expand health care to more Americans, like Joe and I did 10 years ago when he helped craft the Affordable Care Act and nail down the votes to make it the law.

Our democracy.', '“Look, I understand why a lot of Americans are down on government. The way the rules have been set up and abused in Congress make it easier for special interests to stop progress than to make progress. Believe me, I know. I understand why a White factory worker who’s seen his wages cut or his job shipped overseas might feel like the government no longer looks out for him, and why a Black mom might feel like it never looked out for her at all.

They know they can’t win you over with their policies. So they’re hoping to make it as hard as possible for you to vote, and to convince you that your vote doesn’t matter. That’s how they win. That’s how they get to keep making decisions that affect your life, and the lives of the people you love. That’s how the economy will keep getting skewed to the wealthy and well-connected, how our health systems will let more people fall through the cracks. That’s how a democracy withers, until it’s no democracy at all.', '“And we cannot let that happen. Do not let them take away your power. Do not let them take away your democracy. Make a plan right now for how you’re going to get involved and vote. Do it as early as you can and tell your family and friends how they can vote too. Do what Americans have done for over two centuries when faced with even tougher times than this – all those quiet heroes who found the courage to keep marching, keep pushing in the face of hardship and injustice.', '“Last month, we lost a giant of American democracy in John Lewis. Some years ago, I sat down with John and the few remaining leaders of the early civil rights movement. One of them told me he never imagined he’d walk into the White House and see a president who looked like his grandson. Then he told me that he’d looked it up, and it turned out that on the very day that I was born, he was marching into a jail cell, trying to end Jim Crow segregation in the South.', '“What we do echoes through the generations.', '“Whatever our backgrounds, we’re all the children of Americans who fought the good fight. Great grandparents working in firetraps and sweatshops without rights or representation. Farmers losing their dreams to dust. Irish and Italians and Asians and Latinos told to go back where you came from. Jews and Catholics, Muslims and Sikhs, made to feel suspect for the way they worshipped. Black Americans chained and whipped and hanged. Spit on for trying to sit at lunch counters. Beaten for trying to vote.', '“If anyone had a right to believe that this democracy did not work, and could not work, it was those Americans. Our ancestors. They were on the receiving end of a democracy that had fallen short all their lives. They knew how far the daily reality of America strayed from the myth. And yet, instead of giving up, they joined together and said somehow, some way, we are going to make this work. We are going to bring those words, in our founding documents, to life.', '“I’ve seen that same spirit rising these past few years. Folks of every age and background who packed city centers and airports and rural roads so that families wouldn’t be separated. So that another classroom wouldn’t get shot up. So that our kids won’t grow up on an uninhabitable planet. Americans of all races joining together to declare, in the face of injustice and brutality at the hands of the state, that Black lives matter, no more, but no less, so that no child in this country feels the continuing sting of racism.', '“To the young people who led us this summer, telling us we need to be better – in so many ways, you are this country’s dreams fulfilled. Earlier generations had to be persuaded that everyone has equal worth. For you, it’s a given – a conviction.

You can take it to a better place. You’re the missing ingredient – the ones who will decide whether or not America becomes the country that fully lives up to its creed.', '“That work will continue long after this election. But any chance of success depends entirely on the outcome of this election. This administration has shown it will tear our democracy down if that’s what it takes for them to win. So we have to get busy building it up – by pouring all our efforts into these 76 days, and by voting like never before – for Joe and Kamala, and candidates up and down the ticket, so that we leave no doubt about what this country we love stands for – today and for all our days to come.', '“Stay safe.

65,Jeff Bezos: Widespread coronavirus testing needed before economy can get running again,2020-04-16T11:34:27+0000,"['Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said Thursday that mass testing around the world for the coronavirus is needed to “get the economy back up and running.”', 'In his annual shareholder letter, Bezos also pointed to efforts Amazon has taken to protect its employees from the pandemic.', 'Bezos pointed to Amazon’s efforts to develop “incremental testing capacity,” which the company announced last week. As part of that announcement, Amazon said it hopes to begin testing all of its employees, including those who show no symptoms.', '“Regular testing on a global scale, across all industries, would both help keep people safe and help get the economy back up and running,” Bezos said. “For this to work, we as a society would need vastly more testing capacity than is currently available.”', 'Bezos detailed other steps Amazon has taken to curb the coronavirus, such as providing employees with face masks and distributing temperature checks for warehouse workers, delivery drivers and Whole Foods employees. He added that Amazon temporarily closed some of its physical stores, including Amazon Books, Amazon 4-star and Amazon Pop Up stores as they don’t sell essential products, and offered those store employees roles in other parts of the company.', 'Despite the new safety measures, Amazon workers from at least three facilities have staged protests to call for the company to close facilities where there are positive cases of the virus. A dozen workers told CNBC they felt Amazon needed to provide employees with paid time off, among other concerns.', 'Amazon’s logistics and delivery systems have been under some strain since the pandemic worsened across the globe. Due to a surge in online orders, the company was forced to prioritize shipments of essential goods at its fulfillment centers, resulting in longer delivery times and a rare disruption to its typical two-day and one-day delivery windows.', 'Bezos said unlike the typical holiday shopping season, the surge over the last few months “occurred with little warning, creating major challenges for our suppliers and delivery network.” For that reason and others, Bezos added that his “own time and thinking” continues to be focused on the coronavirus.', '“I am extremely grateful to my fellow Amazonians for all the grit and ingenuity they are showing as we move through this,” Bezos said. “You can count on all of us to look beyond the immediate crisis for insights and lessons and how to apply them going forward.”', 'Amazon had 798,000 full-time and part-time employees as of Dec. 31 and has hired more than 100,000 new employees since March to deal with coronavirus demands and plans to add 75,000 more jobs.', 'You can read the letter in full below:', 'To our shareowners:', 'One thing we’ve learned from the COVID-19 crisis is how important Amazon has become to our customers. We want you to know we take this responsibility seriously, and we’re proud of the work our teams are doing to help customers through this difficult time.', 'Amazonians are working around the clock to get necessary supplies delivered directly to the doorsteps of people who need them. The demand we are seeing for essential products has been and remains high. But unlike a predictable holiday surge, this spike occurred with little warning, creating major challenges for our suppliers and delivery network. We quickly prioritized the stocking and delivery of essential household staples, medical supplies, and other critical products.', 'Our Whole Foods Market stores have remained open, providing fresh food and other vital goods for customers. We are taking steps to help those most vulnerable to the virus, setting aside the first hour of shopping at Whole Foods each day for seniors. We have temporarily closed Amazon Books, Amazon 4-star, and Amazon Pop Up stores because they don’t sell essential products, and we offered associates from those closed stores the opportunity to continue working in other parts of Amazon.', 'Crucially, while providing these essential services, we are focused on the safety of our employees and contractors around the world—we are deeply grateful for their heroic work and are committed to their health and well-being. Consulting closely with medical experts and health authorities, we’ve made over 150 significant process changes in our operations network and Whole Foods Market stores to help teams stay healthy, and we conduct daily audits of the measures we’ve put into place. We’ve distributed face masks and implemented temperature checks at sites around the world to help protect employees and support staff. We regularly sanitize door handles, stairway handrails, lockers, elevator buttons, and touch screens, and disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizer are standard across our network.', 'We’ve also introduced extensive social distancing measures to help protect our associates. We have eliminated stand-up meetings during shifts, moved information sharing to bulletin boards, staggered break times, and spread out chairs in breakrooms. While training new hires is challenging with new distancing requirements, we continue to ensure that every new employee gets six hours of safety training. We’ve shifted training protocols so we don’t have employees gathering in one spot, and we’ve adjusted our hiring processes to allow for social distancing.', 'A next step in protecting our employees might be regular testing of all Amazonians, including those showing no symptoms. Regular testing on a global scale, across all industries, would both help keep people safe and help get the economy back up and running. For this to work, we as a society would need vastly more testing capacity than is currently available. If every person could be tested regularly, it would make a huge difference in how we fight this virus. Those who test positive could be quarantined and cared for, and everyone who tests negative could re-enter the economy with confidence.', 'We’ve begun the work of building incremental testing capacity. A team of Amazonians—from research scientists and program managers to procurement specialists and software engineers—moved from their normal day jobs onto a dedicated team to work on this initiative. We have begun assembling the equipment we need to build our first lab and hope to start testing small numbers of our frontline employees soon. We are not sure how far we will get in the relevant timeframe, but we think it’s worth trying, and we stand ready to share anything we learn.', 'While we explore longer-term solutions, we are also committed to helping support employees now. We increased our minimum wage through the end of April by $2 per hour in the U.S., $2 per hour in Canada, £2 per hour in the UK, and €2 per hour in many European countries. And we are paying associates double our regular rate for any overtime worked—a minimum of $34 an hour—an increase from time and a half. These wage increases will cost more than $500 million, just through the end of April, and likely more than that over time. While we recognize this is expensive, we believe it’s the right thing to do under the circumstances. We also established the Amazon Relief Fund—with an initial $25 million in funding—to support our independent delivery service partners and their drivers, Amazon Flex participants, and temporary employees under financial distress.', 'In March, we opened 100,000 new positions across our fulfillment and delivery network. Earlier this week, after successfully filling those roles, we announced we were creating another 75,000 jobs to respond to customer demand. These new hires are helping customers who depend on us to meet their critical needs. We know that many people around the world have suffered financially as jobs are lost or furloughed. We are happy to have them on our teams until things return to normal and either their former employer can bring them back or new jobs become available. We’ve welcomed Joe Duffy, who joined after losing his job as a mechanic at Newark airport and learned about an opening from a friend who is an Amazon operations analyst. Dallas preschool teacher Darby Griffin joined after her school closed on March 9th and now helps manage new inventory. We’re happy to have Darby with us until she can return to the classroom.', 'Amazon is acting aggressively to protect our customers from bad actors looking to exploit the crisis. We’ve removed over half a million offers from our stores due to COVID-based price gouging, and we’ve suspended more than 6,000 selling accounts globally for violating our fair-pricing policies. Amazon turned over information about sellers we suspect engaged in price gouging of products related to COVID-19 to 42 state attorneys general offices. To accelerate our response to price-gouging incidents, we created a special communication channel for state attorneys general to quickly and easily escalate consumer complaints to us.', 'Amazon Web Services is also playing an important role in this crisis. The ability for organizations to access scalable, dependable, and highly secure computing power—whether for vital healthcare work, to help students continue learning, or to keep unprecedented numbers of employees online and productive from home—is critical in this situation. Hospital networks, pharmaceutical companies, and research labs are using AWS to care for patients, explore treatments, and mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 in many other ways. Academic institutions around the world are transitioning from in-person to virtual classrooms and are running on AWS to help ensure continuity of learning. And governments are leveraging AWS as a secure platform to build out new capabilities in their efforts to end this pandemic.', 'We are collaborating with the World Health Organization, supplying advanced cloud technologies and technical expertise to track the virus, understand the outbreak, and better contain its spread. WHO is leveraging our cloud to build large-scale data lakes, aggregate epidemiological country data, rapidly translate medical training videos into different languages, and help global healthcare workers better treat patients. We are separately making a public AWS COVID-19 data lake available as a centralized repository for up-to-date and curated information related to the spread and characteristics of the virus and its associated illness so experts can access and analyze the latest data in their battle against the disease.', 'We also launched the AWS Diagnostic Development Initiative, a program to support customers working to bring more accurate diagnostic solutions to market for COVID-19. Better diagnostics help accelerate treatment and containment of this pandemic. We committed $20 million to accelerate this work and help our customers harness the cloud to tackle this challenge. While the program was established in response to COVID-19, we also are looking toward the future, and we will fund diagnostic research projects that have the potential to blunt future infectious disease outbreaks.', 'Customers around the world have leveraged the cloud to scale up services and stand up responses to COVID-19. We joined the New York City COVID-19 Rapid Response Coalition to develop a conversational agent to enable at-risk and elderly New Yorkers to receive accurate, timely information about medical and other important needs. In response to a request from the Los Angeles Unified School District to transition 700,000 students to remote learning, AWS helped establish a call center to field IT questions, provide remote support, and enable staff to answer calls. We are providing cloud services to the CDC to help thousands of public health practitioners and clinicians gather data related to COVID-19 and inform response efforts. In the UK, AWS provides the cloud computing infrastructure for a project that analyzes hospital occupancy levels, emergency room capacity, and patient wait times to help the country’s National Health Service decide where best to allocate resources. In Canada, OTN—one of the world’s largest virtual care networks—is scaling its AWS-powered video service to accommodate a 4,000% spike in demand to support citizens as the pandemic continues. In Brazil, AWS will provide the São Paulo State Government with cloud computing infrastructure to guarantee online classes to 1 million students in public schools across the state.', 'Following CDC guidance, our Alexa health team built an experience that lets U.S. customers check their risk level for COVID-19 at home. Customers can ask, “Alexa, what do I do if I think I have COVID-19?” or “Alexa, what do I do if I think I have coronavirus?” Alexa then asks a series of questions about the person’s symptoms and possible exposure. Based on those responses, Alexa then provides CDC-sourced guidance. We created a similar service in Japan, based on guidance from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare.', 'We’re making it easy for customers to use Amazon.com or Alexa to donate directly to charities on the front lines of the COVID-19 crisis, including Feeding America, the American Red Cross, and Save the Children. Echo users have the option to say, “Alexa, make a donation to Feeding America COVID-19 Response Fund.” In Seattle, we’ve partnered with a catering business to distribute 73,000 meals to 2,700 elderly and medically vulnerable residents in Seattle and King County during the outbreak, and we donated 8,200 laptops to help Seattle Public Schools students gain access to a device while classes are conducted virtually.', 'Although these are incredibly difficult times, they are an important reminder that what we do as a company can make a big difference in people’s lives. Customers count on us to be there, and we are fortunate to be able to help. With our scale and ability to innovate quickly, Amazon can make a positive impact and be an organizing force for progress.', 'Last year, we co-founded The Climate Pledge with Christiana Figueres, the UN’s former climate change chief and founder of Global Optimism, and became the first signatory to the pledge. The pledge commits Amazon to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement 10 years early—and be net zero carbon by 2040. Amazon faces significant challenges in achieving this goal because we don’t just move information around—we have extensive physical infrastructure and deliver more than 10 billion items worldwide a year. And we believe if Amazon can get to net zero carbon ten years early, any company can—and we want to work together with all companies to make it a reality.', 'To that end, we are recruiting other companies to sign The Climate Pledge. Signatories agree to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions regularly, implement decarbonization strategies in line with the Paris Agreement, and achieve net zero annual carbon emissions by 2040. (We’ll be announcing new signatories soon.)', 'We plan to meet the pledge, in part, by purchasing 100,000 electric delivery vans from Rivian—a Michigan-based producer of electric vehicles. Amazon aims to have 10,000 of Rivian’s new electric vans on the road as early as 2022, and all 100,000 vehicles on the road by 2030. That’s good for the environment, but the promise is even greater. This type of investment sends a signal to the marketplace to start inventing and developing new technologies that large, global companies need to transition to a low-carbon economy.', 'We’ve also committed to reaching 80% renewable energy by 2024 and 100% renewable energy by 2030. (The team is actually pushing to get to 100% by 2025 and has a challenging but credible plan to pull that off.) Globally, Amazon has 86 solar and wind projects that have the capacity to generate over 2,300 MW and deliver more than 6.3 million MWh of energy annually—enough to power more than 580,000 U.S. homes.', 'We’ve made tremendous progress cutting packaging waste. More than a decade ago, we created the Frustration-Free Packaging program to encourage manufacturers to package their products in easy-to-open, 100% recyclable packaging that is ready to ship to customers without the need for an additional shipping box. Since 2008, this program has saved more than 810,000 tons of packaging material and eliminated the use of 1.4 billion shipping boxes.', 'We are making these significant investments to drive our carbon footprint to zero despite the fact that shopping online is already inherently more carbon efficient than going to the store. Amazon’s sustainability scientists have spent more than three years developing the models, tools, and metrics to measure our carbon footprint. Their detailed analysis has found that shopping online consistently generates less carbon than driving to a store, since a single delivery van trip can take approximately 100 roundtrip car journeys off the road on average. Our scientists developed a model to compare the carbon intensity of ordering Whole Foods Market groceries online versus driving to your nearest Whole Foods Market store. The study found that, averaged across all basket sizes, online grocery deliveries generate 43% lower carbon emissions per item compared to shopping in stores. Smaller basket sizes generate even greater carbon savings.', 'AWS is also inherently more efficient than the traditional in-house data center. That’s primarily due to two things—higher utilization, and the fact that our servers and facilities are more efficient than what most companies can achieve running their own data centers. Typical single-company data centers operate at roughly 18% server utilization. They need that excess capacity to handle large usage spikes. AWS benefits from multi-tenant usage patterns and operates at far higher server utilization rates. In addition, AWS has been successful in increasing the energy efficiency of its facilities and equipment, for instance by using more efficient evaporative cooling in certain data centers instead of traditional air conditioning. A study by 451 Research found that AWS’s infrastructure is 3.6 times more energy efficient than the median U.S. enterprise data center surveyed. Along with our use of renewable energy, these factors enable AWS to do the same tasks as traditional data centers with an 88% lower carbon footprint. And don’t think we’re not going to get those last 12 points—we’ll make AWS 100% carbon free through more investments in renewable energy projects.', 'Over the last decade, no company has created more jobs than Amazon. Amazon directly employs 840,000 workers worldwide, including over 590,000 in the U.S., 115,000 in Europe, and 95,000 in Asia. In total, Amazon directly and indirectly supports 2 million jobs in the U.S., including 680,000-plus jobs created by Amazon’s investments in areas like construction, logistics, and professional services, plus another 830,000 jobs created by small and medium-sized businesses selling on Amazon. Globally, we support nearly 4 million jobs. We are especially proud of the fact that many of these are entry-level jobs that give people their first opportunity to participate in the workforce.', 'And Amazon’s jobs come with an industry-leading $15 minimum wage and comprehensive benefits. More than 40 million Americans—many making the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour—earn less than the lowest-paid Amazon associate. When we raised our starting minimum wage to $15 an hour in 2018, it had an immediate and meaningful impact on the hundreds of thousands of people working in our fulfillment centers. We want other big employers to join us by raising their own minimum pay rates, and we continue to lobby for a $15 federal minimum wage.', 'We want to improve workers’ lives beyond pay. Amazon provides every full-time employee with health insurance, a 401(k) plan, 20 weeks paid maternity leave, and other benefits. These are the same benefits that Amazon’s most senior executives receive. And with our rapidly changing economy, we see more clearly than ever the need for workers to evolve their skills continually to keep up with technology. That’s why we’re spending $700 million to provide more than 100,000 Amazonians access to training programs, at their places of work, in high-demand fields such as healthcare, cloud computing, and machine learning. Since 2012, we have offered Career Choice, a pre-paid tuition program for fulfillment center associates looking to move into high- demand occupations. Amazon pays up to 95% of tuition and fees toward a certificate or diploma in qualified fields of study, leading to enhanced employment opportunities in high-demand jobs. Since its launch, more than 25,000 Amazonians have received training for in-demand occupations.', 'To ensure that future generations have the skills they need to thrive in a technology-driven economy, we started a program last year called Amazon Future Engineer, which is designed to educate and train low-income and disadvantaged young people to pursue careers in computer science. We have an ambitious goal: to help hundreds of thousands of students each year learn computer science and coding. Amazon Future Engineer currently funds Introduction to Computer Science and AP Computer Science classes for more than 2,000 schools in underserved communities across the country. Each year, Amazon Future Engineer also gives 100 four-year, $40,000 college scholarships to computer science students from low-income backgrounds. Those scholarship recipients also receive guaranteed, paid internships at Amazon after their first year of college. Our program in the UK funds 120 engineering apprenticeships and helps students from disadvantaged backgrounds pursue technology careers.', 'For now, my own time and thinking continues to be focused on COVID-19 and how Amazon can help while we’re in the middle of it. I am extremely grateful to my fellow Amazonians for all the grit and ingenuity they are showing as we move through this. You can count on all of us to look beyond the immediate crisis for insights and lessons and how to apply them going forward.', 'Reflect on this from Theodor Seuss Geisel:', '“When something bad happens you have three choices. You can either let it define you, let it destroy you, or you can let it strengthen you.”', 'I am very optimistic about which of these civilization is going to choose.', 'Even in these circumstances, it remains Day 1.

The 30-hour Black Friday-like sales event is marketed to Prime members, meaning the millions of projected shipments destined for doorsteps will have two days or less to get there.', 'Enter Prime Air — the air cargo service Amazon officially introduced last summer.', '“These planes are predominantly focused on our two-day network,” said Dave Clark, Amazon’s senior vice president of worldwide operations and customer service, a role that includes oversight of the supply chain and transportation network. “What it does is it allows us to make the [shipping] cut-off later, so you can order later and later and still get that in the two-day promise with our own air network.” ', 'Standing in front a Boeing 767 fitted for freight and emblazoned in blue and white branding including the Prime swish logo, Clark said the fleet of 24 planes allows Amazon to fly to cargo hubs, but also from “point to point.” Sixteen planes will be added by mid-2018.', 'Traditional cargo flights typically involve hub stops; flying point to point means flying direct to a final distribution area from where a shipment will depart on a vehicle on the so-called last mile of delivery to a residence.', 'Clark estimated that the direct option can shave 12 to 15 hours off of a cross-country journey — a crucial reduction when the turnaround is a tight 48 hours or less.', 'The planes are evenly leased out by and operated by two cargo airlines: Air Transport Services Group and Atlas Air Worldwide. Since announcing their deals with the e-commerce giant last year, the two lessors have seen their stocks soar.

It does have warrants to buy at least a 20 percent share of each company over the next several years, and it is investing $1.5 billion into an air cargo hub at Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky Airport, where package carrier DHL has operations.', 'But the shipping strategy stretches far beyond jetliners. Amazon has been plowing billions of dollars into steadily building its own transportation and logistics network — one that included 5,000 branded semi trailers hauled by contracted truckers, container shipping for Asian sellers importing goods to be sold through the Amazon platform, tens of millions of square feet of automated warehouse space, apps for last-mile and middle-mile delivery services, and of course eventually drones (which also falls under the Prime Air umbrella).  The investments have stirred questions in the shipping industry and on Wall Street: Is Amazon really looking to move all of its shipments in-house? Is it looking to eventually compete against the carriers like United Parcel Service and FedEx, which it currently relies upon? Or is this simply a necessary move to be able to keep pace with the aggressive growth of Prime membership?', '“There are really two reasons we do this. First and foremost, I think it’s innovation for customers. So whether it be planes enabling us to do later cut-offs for two-day deliveries, or ‘flex’ — which enables us to do one-hour delivery and things like our Prime Now business — creating new delivery services for customers is a big deal for us,” Clark said from the tarmac at Sea-Tac Airport, a 20-minute drive from Amazon headquarters in downtown Seattle. “Second is supplying incremental capacity to support the growth in Prime customers.”', 'In other words, Amazon is not looking to directly compete with its current shipping partners. At least, not yet.', 'Rather, it’s building out capacity because it needs it, beyond the long-term contracts with UPS, FedEx, the U.S. Postal Service, and others. It’s something all involved have been asserting for years in interviews  and on earnings calls, as e-commerce growth continues to outpace capacity and the pace at which shippers have been able to expand their networks  to better meet that demand.', 'Some analysts surmise the major carriers don’t make much money on that business anyway since the sheer scale of the Amazon operation has enabled it to negotiate rock-bottom shipping rates that translate into razor-thin margins for the companies involved.', 'Additionally, many are skeptical Amazon could successfully get into the game of transporting goods for other shippers since so many are retailers and consumer-oriented businesses that now view the tech behemoth as a serious threat.', 'For Amazon, bringing more transportation capabilities in-house could help rein in ballooning shipping costs — a metric it only just recently began breaking out in quarterly earnings. In the first quarter, worldwide shipping revenue grew 37 percent year on year to $2.5 billion; worldwide shipping costs grew 34 percent to $4.4 billion. It could also help give the company famous for its fixation on customer service more control, after delivery misses by UPS and FedEx during Christmas seasons past.', 'As for Prime Air, the next few days will prove to be the fledgling fleet’s biggest delivery test yet — and one coming as some pilots look to negotiate their union contracts with the lessors. ', 'As for UPS, FedEx and the Postal Service, they all insist they’re ready to deliver for all of their customers this week.', '“We have a great group of core carriers around the world that do work for us and we continue to partner with them, and then we’re about enabling a ton of small businesses — whether that be in the last-mile space; the middle-mile, providing power for the over 5,000 trailers we operate; or working with Atlas and ATSG,” said Clark. “What we think we’re doing is stitching together a great group of small businesses that are enabling fast delivery for Prime customers.”']"

The State  Department—in charge because the project would cross an  international border—is still studying the issue and its  environmental impact.

But the infrastructure needed to transport that crude out of Texas oil fields and onto the world market has been lacking.', 'This month marks a big change for the industry with the start of the Plains All American Pipeline’s Cactus II, a 670,000 barrel a day pipeline, connecting the Permian Basin to Corpus Christi, Texas, and from there to the world. That pipeline, and another, named Epic, are just the start, with more to follow.', 'The new pipelines are expected to take more Texas crude to the Gulf Coast, and from there it can be shipped out to the world, but the world is now well supplied, and even more U.S. oil could help depress prices, especially if the trade wars continue to suppress demand.', 'According to Citigroup, the new pipelines could help grow U.S. oil exports from the current 3 million barrels a day by 1 million barrels more by year-end and another million barrels next year. Exports have already grown by an average 970,00 barrels a day this year over last year, according to Citigroup.', '', 'Source: Citigroup', '“It will be 4 million barrels a day by six or eight months. Four million barrels a day is a lot bigger than the North Sea as a whole. That crude oil is going to go everywhere. It goes to Asia, Europe, to India,” said Edward Morse, Citigroup global head of commodities research. “If the U.S. gets to 6 million barrels a day in three years, it will be hands-down the world benchmark.”', 'The surge in pipeline capacity will help unlock a bottleneck of oil in the Permian Basin, which Citi has forecast could double its production to about 8 million barrels a day by 2023.', 'As the pipelines are being built, there will be a need for increased export capacity.

The U.S. will soon have the export capacity for 6 million barrels a day, and even more is planned, according to Citi.', '“Until now, it’s been an issue of getting oil from the Permian down to the Gulf Coast.

The price fell to a low of $42 on Christmas Eve, as risk markets sold off, and has been in the mid-$50s lately. Brent futures, the international benchmark, has traded on both sides of $60 per barrel this month.', 'While OPEC has intentionally curbed production, simple economics have contained U.S. production growth, which has been flattish in recent weeks, after rising from 11 million barrels a day a year ago.', '“Obviously, companies are cutting back. They’re cutting back in terms of investment and activity. You see the rig count coming down. You still see production efficiencies driving growth, but you’ll have a slower rate of sequential growth from here,” said Blanch. He noted that U.S. rig count was down 12% from year-ago levels at the middle of August.', '', 'Morse said he expects Russia and OPEC to stay together, and an economic slowdown would encourage them to continue their partnership.', '“A recession scenario makes it easier for them to believe in what they’ve been saying,” he said, noting the producers have held oil from the market to stabilize supplies.', 'When demand drops, prices fall and U.S. producers would no longer find it makes economic sense to pump as much oil. An economic downturn would only slow the trend, not stop it.', '“We agree there’s going to be an overabundance for the next two to three years. We see prices being challenged for the next two to three years. We see Brent in the low $50s, and WTI in the high $40s, which is not an environment where there’s going to be much as much reinvestment, as there is,” Morse said. “We’ll have to modify our expectations for production growth, given the increased likelihood that global GDP is going to be low and even without a recession, demand will be lower.”', 'Even if there is a more significant slowdown, the U.S. will continue to move toward a more dominant role in the world oil market, with each barrel that comes out of the Gulf Coast.

Indeed, over the past century, U.S. administrations have mainly deployed the IEEPA to prosecute drug trafficking or financial terrorism through sanctions or other economic penalties.', 'It is not clear how, or under what authority, Trump could implement this directive. If he were to push further, companies would likely challenge the order, leading to litigation. And, even then, it’s uncertain how a court would rule. Some analysts argue that the law allows the president to carry out certain actions limiting companies’ business in China, by blocking future investments, even if it didn’t allow the Trump administration to outright order them to relocate.', 'U.S. companies had already started taking steps to diversify production amid flaring tensions over the past year, but this latest command forces a myriad of industries to grapple with escalating trade uncertainty.', 'Trump said last week he would raise existing duties on $250 billion in Chinese products from 25% to 30% on Oct. 1. Additionally, tariffs on another $112 billion of Chinese goods, which took effect on Sunday, are now 15% instead of 10%. Weighed down by a protracted trade dispute over the year and a half, China has relinquished its top spot as America’s largest trading partner and now sits in third place, behind Mexico and Canada.', 'Few companies are planning to move completely out of China. Doing so would prove particularly disruptive for America’s industrial and technology heavyweights that rely on the Chinese manufacturing base as critical parts of their supply chains. China still makes roughly 25% of all manufactured goods around the world — in part because of the difficulty in finding a sufficient workforce on other countries’ factory floors.', 'Given the proximity to China, Southeast Asian countries including Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia have attracted attention in recent months as potential alternative sourcing destinations. A handful of firms have successfully shifted some of their production to these countries, but many have been stifled by a dearth of specialized supply chains and labor shortages (in Cambodia, over 40% of all goods inspected last quarter did not meet inspection standards).', 'Take Boeing for instance — the Chicago-based aircraft maker doesn’t look poised to abandon the Chinese market any time soon after opening a plant for 737 Max jets late last year. Moving production could also put Boeing at risk of ceding ground to rival Airbus, which competes heavily in the Chinese market.

It would take years for Apple to leave China altogether and could clear the way for competitors like Samsung to eat into its market share. Apple also notoriously failed to build high-end computers stateside — stymied by a lack of suppliers that could make the right screw.', 'Still, Apple has reportedly asked its major suppliers to assess the cost implications of moving between 15% and 30% of their production capacity from China to countries in Southeast Asia. That’s in part because its smartwatches and AirPod wireless headphones now face a 15% tariff, while a tax on the iPhone could take effect on Dec. 15.', 'America’s other largest technology firms are following Apple’s lead. Computer makers HP Inc. and Dell Technologies are reportedly contemplating moving up to 30% of their notebook production out of China.

It is English speaking because of the legacy of British rule, and its two biggest ethnic groups are Afro-Guyanese and Indo-Guyanese — the descendants of slaves from Africa and of indentured servants brought from the Indian subcontinent in the 19th century.', 'Until now, the country had never produced oil, and traditionally it has traded its rice crop for fuel from Venezuela. Now it is attracting experienced Texas oilmen like Doug McGehee, Exxon’s Guyana operations manager.', 'Over the last 37 years working for ExxonMobil, Mr. McGehee has taken his black cowboy boots, silver belt buckle and Texas A&M class ring into the oil fields of Angola, Kazakhstan and Equatorial Guinea. In all those places, oil wealth has risen to the top, only to leave the poor behind. Last year, for example, a Paris criminal court convicted the vice president of Equatorial Guinea of money-laundering and embezzling more than $100 million.', 'But as Mr. McGehee monitored operations aboard the Noble Bob Douglas drill ship on a recent day, he insisted that Guyana could be different.', '“The math is right here,” he said, noting that the country has a tiny population — below 800,000 — to share all the new wealth. Guyana’s government stands to take in more than $6 billion in royalties and taxes annually by the end of the 2020s, according to the Norwegian consultancy Rystad Energy.', '“If the government manages the resource right, every Guyanese should benefit with better schools, better health facilities, better roads,” Mr. McGehee said.', 'That is no small “if.”', 'Guyanese need look no further than neighboring Venezuela to see a failed state where the world’s largest oil reserves have not prevented hunger, shortages of medicine and hyperinflation from producing widespread misery. Nearby Trinidad and Tobago offers another example of how countries dependent on oil can neglect traditional industries and then suffer severe economic shocks when crude and natural gas prices fall.', 'Scholars call the syndrome the “resource curse.”', 'Others warn of the “Dutch disease,” a phenomenon so labeled in the 1970s after a natural gas boom sapped the strength of manufacturing in the Netherlands. Nations that contract the disease from a sudden influx of mineral money typically suffer a surge of inflation, while labor from farming and other traditional professions is drawn to the higher-paying oil sector. Thus, wealth becomes more concentrated.', 'There are some examples of countries effectively using oil to reduce poverty. Malaysia, with large offshore oil production, has kept its economy diversified and growing. In the Middle East, Oman is a model for using oil and gas wealth to modernize its economy.', 'But dispiriting examples of wasted opportunity abound.', '“We’re all concerned about the negatives,” Prime Minister Moses V. Nagamootoo said.', 'Dawn Chung Layne, who operates a sewing business out of her mother-in-law’s concrete house in Georgetown, is also anxious. She is attending workshops at the Center for Local Business Development, a program financed by Exxon, to learn ways she can benefit from the oil economy. She hopes to make curtains and linen for cafeterias on the oil ships, and uniforms for sports teams established by foreign companies and their families.', 'But she also sees risks in these new ventures. More affluent Guyanese may turn away from the sports uniforms she already makes to buy name brands like Nike and Adidas, she said, and she is concerned that food prices will rise.', '“Check out the Trinidad economy,” she said. “They thought oil was the best thing since sliced bread, and they spent Sunday to Sunday. They stopped producing and imported everything with oil money. It could happen here.”', 'Before the recent breakthrough, various oil companies had drilled more than 40 wells off Guyana and neighboring Suriname since the 1960s. All were dry holes or otherwise not economically promising. But as oil prices rose a few years ago, Exxon and Royal Dutch Shell decided to take another look. (Shell eventually dropped out of the partnership.)', 'Exxon’s top geoscientist on the scene was Kerry Moreland, an Oklahoman whose family has been in oil for three generations. Ms. Moreland toyed with becoming a professional bowler and had interned as a tornado chaser for a Tulsa television station before going to work for Exxon and traveling the world in search of new fields. She pinpointed on the map where the first deepwater well, named Liza-1, should be drilled.', 'Recalling the day three years ago when she decided to duck out of some business meetings in Georgetown to visit the drilling platform, she said there was no more than a 20 percent chance that a meaningful amount of oil would burst out from three miles below the ocean bottom.', 'As luck would have it, just as her helicopter landed on the platform, the drill bit penetrated the oil reservoir. She went to the control room as the first data from the wells showed promising signs of hydrocarbons. When rock fragments came to the surface a few hours later, they were dripping with oil.', '“At that moment, it was ‘Oh, my God, we’ve made a discovery,’” Ms. Moreland said. “You have to pinch yourself and ask, ‘Is this really happening?’ And it hit right then, this could be game changing for the country, one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere. It was a dream come true for any geologist.’’', 'Exxon is known in the industry as a slow-moving, stodgy company, but Ms. Moreland’s enthusiasm caught fire through the executive wing in the Texas headquarters known as the God Pod. Within three months, the company sent two vessels to conduct the largest three-dimensional seismic test that Exxon had ever undertaken, over 6,500 square miles, in search of more oil.', 'There’s a lot at stake for Exxon in Guyana.', 'In recent years, its stock price has slumped because of disappointing production and depleting reserves. The company invested heavily in Canadian oil sands and in natural gas when prices were high, bets that have not worked out as well as expected. While the company was forced to write off large assets in Canada, Western sanctions on Russia foiled its plans to drill in the Russian Arctic.', 'Darren Woods, the company’s chief executive, has a plan to reverse company fortunes, and Guyana is a big part of it.', 'Leading a consortium that includes Hess and the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, Exxon is making an effort here that is nothing if not ambitious. Within three years of its big first discovery, it has begun drilling the first of 17 wells that will start yielding oil in 2020, with a floating production, storage and offloading vessel able to handle 120,000 barrels a day. And that is just the first phase.', 'Another floating vessel, with a capacity of 220,000 barrels a day, is planned, and a third vessel is being considered. In all, 500,000 barrels a day could be produced by sometime in the next decade — the equivalent of Ecuador’s national output. (Repsol of Spain, Tullow Oil of Britain and other companies are exploring, too.)', '“It’s a growth area for us,” said Mr. McGehee, the Exxon operations manager. “We keep finding oil.”', 'That produces nothing but excitement for the 60 Guyanese workers on the Noble Bob Douglas drill ship, who have typically seen their incomes soar.', 'Gorshum Inniss, a 25-year-old roustabout with an easy smile and flashing dark eyes, is working on a crane crew lifting casing pipe for new wells, doubling what he earned working on a tugboat. He said he now had enough money to visit his parents and younger brother in New York and planned to build a house for him and his daughter.', '“I’m proud to be one of the pioneers in this big moment for Guyana,” he said. “I see Guyana as the new Middle East.”', 'Not far from the turbulent Venezuelan border, there is a quiet stretch of coastline, pounded by surf, known as Shell Beach because its sand is made of tiny crushed seashells that make it feel like sawdust. Several endangered species of turtles come to nest at night. Once hunted for food, they are jealously guarded from poachers by residents who make a living fishing and selling coconuts.', 'Audley James, a former turtle hunter who makes necklaces out of beads and coconut shells, remembers when Trinidadian environmental consultants representing Repsol came six years ago to give two days of spill-response training.', 'The Trinidadians taught the residents how to lay temporary floating barriers to protect the beach from an oil spill, and gave them training certificates that look like diplomas. But there has been no further training that might prepare them for what is now a much less theoretical hazard.', '“Plenty of us don’t understand what is going on,” Mr. James said.', 'Environmentalists are worried that oil will forestall development of renewable energy and that the government and oil companies are not fully prepared to prevent a possible spill.', '“It’s two years before first oil, and we don’t have a national oil spill contingency plan,” said Annette Arjoon-Martins, president of the Guyana Marine Conservation Society. “We have our hands in the mouth of a jaguar.”', 'Ms. Arjoon-Martins said the government’s agreement with Exxon did not specify in enough detail the company’s responsibilities in case of a spill. Government officials disagreed, saying the country’s laws would hold the company fully liable.', 'Exxon executives say the company is doing everything possible to minimize the dangers of a spill disaster. The company has skimmers and oil booms on hand to collect errant oil, and it has applied to the government to use chemical dispersants in an emergency to break up any spilled oil. They say Guyana is close enough to the Gulf of Mexico to bring in plenty of help in an emergency.', 'The company has agreed to map the coastal mangroves and study the area’s fish, bird and turtle migration routes to set priorities in case a cleanup is ever needed, executives said. And in another potential environmental benefit, the company is planning to build a natural-gas pipeline to shore that will replace the heavy fuel oil burned for the country’s power plants, lowering costs to consumers and businesses.', '“We are committed to develop these resources in the most responsible way with a minimal impact on the environment,” said Rod Henson, Exxon’s Guyana manager. “We stand by our operations, and in the unlikely event of an incident, we will absolutely respond immediately and we will fully take care of our responsibilities.”', 'Local oil executives say one obstacle to overcome is a lackadaisical attitude toward safety among Guyanese workers, who frequently arrive at their construction and wharf jobs in flip-flops and sometimes use their hard hats as soup bowls. That is something Exxon and other companies are working to change with courses and other training that teach workers to be careful, not only for their own safety but also to safeguard the fragile marine environment.', 'At a recent daily meeting of the crew of the Noble Bob Douglas to review environmental and safety precautions, Mr. Inniss, the roustabout, was given a chance to make his own safety presentation. He told of a serious accident he had a couple of years ago working on his motorcycle when he neglectfully left the motor running while adjusting a chain. He lost three fingertips.', '“Use your heads before you use your hands,” he told the room full of Guyanese and American workers. He got an ovation and smiled proudly.', 'To visit the most senior oil regulator in Georgetown, one needs to climb an exterior staircase of warped wood that could sorely use a fresh coat of paint.', 'At the top is the tiny office of Newell Dennison, the acting head of the Guyana Geology and Mines Commission, whose desk is stacked high with folders beside a single metal filing cabinet. His office is spare of decorations, aside from two bouquets of artificial tropical flowers.', 'Mr. Dennison has a computer by his desk, from which he could consult data gathered by Exxon drill ships, though he said he had yet to do so. “We’re in transition,” he explained. “It’s a challenge.’’', 'For all the international attention that Guyana’s oil bonanza is beginning to generate, Mr. Dennison and the Department of Natural Resources have a mere nine technically trained people responsible for regulating oil production, engineering and geological research.', '“You would expect we would have a problem to have 100 percent monitoring with our lack of resources,” said Mr. Dennison, a middle-aged geologist with horn-rimmed glasses and a neatly trimmed goatee. “My commission cannot be all of a sudden everything people expect us to be.”', 'There are a few signs of progress.', 'Guyana’s president, David A. Granger, a retired military commander leading a fractious coalition, has tried to establish a legal framework for the coming bonanza. To bypass corrupt officials, Mr. Granger has announced his intention to form an energy department for policymaking, responsible to the president, and an independent petroleum commission to regulate the industry and grant exploration and production licenses.', 'Under pressure to break with past secretive deals with international companies, Mr. Granger published Guyana’s contract with Exxon on a government website in December, opening a vigorous public debate on its terms. He has promised to end closed-door bidding for drilling rights, and to open auctions for future development.', 'Many of the changes have been promoted by Jan Mangal, Mr. Granger’s personal petroleum adviser and brother of Lars Mangal, the businessman. Jan Mangal, a Guyanese-born former Chevron project manager, has advised the president to put a hold on new leasing until the petroleum commission can be established with new personnel and has called for an investigation of several oil-exploration concessions made by the previous government to small oil companies.', '“I see a lot of red flags,” said Mr. Mangal, who shuttles between Guyana and his home in Houston. “We cannot allow the Guyanese industry to be built around this shabby foundation of corruption.”', 'There are other signs of trouble.', 'Foreign development bank advisers have told the government that legislation to create a sovereign wealth fund to invest the royalties and taxes coming to the government lacks sufficient regulatory controls to avert corruption. The legislation is now in limbo. Mr. Granger’s energy department has not gotten off the ground, and a bill to set up the petroleum commission is stuck in the National Assembly.', 'That leaves Mr. Dennison and his commission in charge of regulation. He said he and everyone in the government felt pressure to get things right.', '“Of course I worry,” Mr. Dennison said.']"

Now China is pushing its way into the Arctic, announcing last month its ambitions to develop a “Polar Silk Road” through the region as warming global temperatures open up new sea lanes and economic opportunities at the top of the world.', 'At play is between one-fifth and a quarter of the world’s untapped fossil-fuel resources, not to mention a range of mineable minerals, including gold, silver, diamond, copper, titanium, graphite, uranium and other valuable rare earth elements. With the ice in retreat, those resources will come increasingly within reach.', 'At a December meeting of climate scientists in New Orleans, a team from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared that the Arctic as we’ve known it is now a thing of the past. Coining a new phrase — the New Arctic — they described the uptick in ocean surface warming and decline in sea ice since 2000 as unprecedented in the past 1,500 years. The Arctic, they wrote, “shows no sign of returning to [the] reliably frozen region of past decades.”', 'As the ice pulls back, corporations and governments are moving in. Seaport facilities, mining operations, oil and gas pipelines — as well as new roads, railways and airstrips to serve them — are arriving in the region at an accelerating pace. An inventory of planned, in-progress, completed or canceled Arctic infrastructure projects compiled by global financial firm Guggenheim Partners tallies roughly 900 projects, requiring a total of $1 trillion in investment, some of which is already on the way.', 'With $300 billion in potential projects either completed, in motion or proposed, Russia is the clear leader in Arctic infrastructure development. The world’s largest country has moved to reopen some abandoned Soviet-era military installations and place new facilities and airfields in its northern territory, while also establishing a string of seaports along its northern coastline. State-controlled oil company Rosneft started drilling the northernmost rig in the Russian Arctic shelf last year in an attempt to tap into a field that could hold more than half a billion barrels of oil. In June it found its first oilfield, in the Laptev Sea in the eastern Arctic. Meanwhile, Russian energy giant Gazprom Neft already pumps oil from beneath Arctic waters via a different offshore field, in the Pechora Sea. ', 'The ultimate goal: to have offshore Arctic oil account for between 20 and 30 percent of Russian production by 2050.', 'Russia isn’t alone. Finland, the United States and Canada have also proposed significant infrastructure investment within their respective Arctic zones. Norway’s state energy company is pursuing exploration activities in the far reaches of the Barents Sea even as its sovereign wealth fund considers divesting from fossil fuels. In January the Trump administration announced plans to open up much of the U.S. outer continental shelf to offshore drilling, including areas off the north shore of Alaska.', 'But it’s the emergence of China — a nation with no territorial claim to the Arctic — as a rising polar power that has the potential to shake up the competition for resources and influence in the region. With its economic and naval power on the rise, China has begun underwriting Arctic development projects despite its lack of territory there, underscoring the region’s growing global importance.', 'Though not all of the Arctic infrastructure projects logged by Guggenheim will be completed, “the level of projects has been improving,” says Jim Pass, a senior managing director at Guggenheim Partners who has traveled extensively in the region. Projects once deemed largely conceptual have matured into well-thought-out capital infrastructure projects that show meaningful return on investment, he says. As the ice continues to recede, a race is on to develop or buy into the projects that can best position states and companies to compete in the New Arctic.', 'In December, at about the same time climate scientists were discussing the latest Arctic Report Card in New Orleans, a tanker departed Russia’s Yamal LNG facility on the country’s northeastern Yamal peninsula bound for the UK. The tanker carried the first shipment of liquified natural gas (LNG) produced by the Yamal LNG facility, which officially opened in the first week of December with Russian President Vladimir Putin presiding over the occasion.', 'The project, one of the Arctic’s more complex energy infrastructure undertakings to date, is but one of nearly $275 billion in potential Arctic energy investments logged in Guggenheim’s database, and a milestone project for Russia, which accounts for nearly $150 billion of that potential investment alone.', 'A look at Russia’s icebreaker inventory underscores its commitment to the region; Russia has nearly 40 icebreaker ships in service, with five more under construction and six more planned. Finland, owner of the world’s second-largest icebreaker fleet has seven, followed by Canada and Sweden at six apiece. The U.S. has five, only one of which is a so-called heavy icebreaker. Scrambling to update its aging fleet, the U.S. Coast Guard plans to build six more (three heavy and three medium icebreakers), though the first won’t be delivered until 2023.', 'Energy resources will likely remain the driver of major investments in the Arctic for the foreseeable future, but for all the fanfare around them highly visible energy projects like Yamal LNG only paint a fraction of the economic picture in the Arctic, Pass says. Guggenheim’s Arctic project inventory includes a data center in Norway, a Finnish biomass-to-ethanol plant, and a Swedish lithium-ion battery factory, among many other projects that fall outside the more conventional categories of fossil fuels, mining, roads and railways. ', 'But the greatest opportunity, he says, is arguably in transport — not just within the Arctic but through it. Much of the Arctic likely won’t see ice-free summertime shipping lanes for some time, perhaps two decades or longer. But other routes, like the Northern Sea Route along Russia’s northern shore are already navigable — albeit not easily — during certain times of the year, trimming some 30 percent to 40 percent off the distance ships would travel between East Asia and Northern Europe if they traversed the conventional Suez Canal route instead. Russia has already installed more than a dozen seaports along the route at places like Arkhangelsk and Murmansk, in the country’s northwest, to Tiksi and Pevek in the northeast.', 'Meanwhile, if data really is the new oil, the New Arctic could be home to those pipelines as well. Undersea cables laid through the Arctic could one day connect Asia, Northern Europe, and North America more directly, providing far shorter routes for data traveling around the northern hemisphere.', '“Whether it’s the fraction of a millisecond it takes for financial transactions to travel between Tokyo and London or whether it’s shorter shipping routes from Northern Europe to China, the Arctic shortens distances,” says Heather Conley, senior vice president for Europe, Eurasia, and the Arctic at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “As globalization continues to emphasize speed, the Arctic will continue to be an important part of our story.”', 'More from Global Investing Hot Spots:Investors get ready for a surge in blockbuster China IPOs Argentina’s president powers biggest stock market boom in the world How Trump can crush the emerging markets stock rally in 2018', 'The story of the New Arctic could nonetheless prove slow to unfold. Though the ice is receding, the Arctic remains a difficult environment in which to operate. The intense cold alone presents challenges not present in other maritime environments, and while sea-ice measurements from last year were, on average, a full quarter lower than the average across three decades prior to 2010, there’s still plenty of ice in the water. Shipping concerns dreaming of an Arctic that’s both easily navigable and inexpensive to traverse will have to wait, perhaps for decades.', 'China has nonetheless taken a keen interest in what the Arctic has to offer in terms of global shipping, fishing stocks, energy security and other mineral resources. The Chinese government has taken what is arguably the longest view in the region, using its financial might to secure access to resources it cannot obtain through territorial claims.', 'For instance, when funding for the the Yamal LNG facility fell short following the imposition of U.S. sanctions on Russia in 2014, China stepped in with $12 billion in financing to finish the project. During President Trump’s trip to China in November, Chinese energy concern Sinopec inked a deal alongside China Investment and Bank of China to provide financing for Alaska LNG, a liquefied natural gas export facility on the other side of the Pacific.', '“They see themselves as a near-Arctic state and as an Arctic stakeholder, and they want to make sure they’re not blocked from the Arctic by the coastal states,” Conley said. “They want to make sure they are sort of an equal partner. Right now they’re exploring their economic opportunities and making sure they have a seat at the negotiating table if anything gets decided about future use of the Arctic.”', 'Last summer Chinese authorities expanded the country’s $1 trillion global infrastructure initiative, known as Belt and Road, to include an Arctic component, bringing the region into China’s larger vision for a connected world with China at the hub. At the same time, a Chinese icebreaker on a scientific mission completed a circumpolar navigation, traversing both the Northern Sea Route along Russia’s northern shore and the Northwest Passage atop North America. It continues to explore free-trade deals in Scandinavia and Canada, while pushing for scientific collaboration in the Arctic as well.', '“There’s high diplomatic engagement and initiative. The Belt and Road initiative now has an Arctic manifestation, and they have a continued interest in science,” Conley said. “The new economic dynamic is that China is very present in the Arctic.”', 'Climatological concerns aside — and there are many — one ancillary consequence of a melting Arctic is a rise in human activity there. This includes an uptick in commercial and scientific traffic and also in military presence and activity. For Russia, in particular, the receding sea ice represents the withdrawal of a natural barrier that has long protected its northern border, prompting its military to boost capability and presence in the region as a means for securing both its border and the increasingly valuable sea lanes and resource wealth beyond.', '“What we’re seeing now is a very slow refreezing of the Arctic geopolitically,” Conley said. “Russia has continued its military modernization in the north, and while it’s not massive, it’s definitely a change in posture.”', 'The growing Russian military presence in the region has stoked old feelings of mistrust, she said, producing antibodies within NATO that are now pushing for an increased Western military presence in the region as well. “We’re not going back by any stretch to a cold war posture, but you’re starting to see that muscle memory coming back,” she said. “And it’s because we’re seeing this uptick in military activity.”', 'The notion that the Arctic might evolve into a flashpoint for global tensions remains remote. The region has long proved a place of international cooperation, where Arctic states settle boundary disputes and other conflicts amicably at the negotiating table (as Russia and Norway did as recently as 2010). But as military activity in the region trends upward alongside commercial activity, the chance of accidents, misunderstandings and miscommunications heightens as well.', 'In a New Arctic with emerging strategic and economic value and where norms are still being established, the potential for tensions to escalate is real. If the Arctic shortens distances, countries that once felt quite far apart may soon find themselves much closer together as the ice recedes.', 'Wary of what geopolitical realities the New Arctic may hold, military planners are already taking such factors into consideration. At a Surface Navy Association event near the Pentagon earlier this month, Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Paul Zukunft noted that the Coast Guard’s new heavy icebreaker will be unarmed when it enters service in 2023.

He is uniquely familiar with Sea Hunter since he oversaw its testing as chief of the Office of Naval Research and its current development as Leidos vice president and Navy strategic account executive.', 'Leidos is the sole defense contractor helping to engineer the vessel.', 'The concept for the unmanned vessel was born in 2010 out of the Pentagon’s so-called mad science wing, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA.', 'The Pentagon’s request from DARPA was colossal: Develop a drone warship capable of hunting submarines, detecting torpedoes and avoiding objects at sea while traveling at a top speed of 27 knots, or 31 mph.', 'Six years later, the crewless, 140-ton, 132-foot-long robotic ship, was christened as Sea Hunter on the Willamette River in Portland, Oregon.', '“The project is classic DARPA, not only game-changing but paradigm-bending,” Paul Scharre writes in “Army of None: Autonomous Weapons and the Future of War.”', '“Sleek and angular, it looks like something time-warped in from the future,” adds Scharre, a former U.S. Army Ranger and senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. “With a long narrow hull and two outriggers, the Sea Hunter carves the oceans like a three-pointed dagger, tracking enemy submarines.”', 'On hand for the ship’s 2016 christening was then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work, who referred to the vessel’s narrow bow as a “Klingon Bird of Prey” from the “Star Trek” series.', '“This will operate wherever the United States Navy operates,” Work told reporters after the ceremony. “It can operate in the South China Sea. It can operate in the Baltic Sea. It can operate in the Persian Gulf. And it can operate in the middle of the Atlantic or the middle of the Pacific.”', '“These will be everywhere,” he added.', 'After its unveiling in 2016, Sea Hunter was transferred to the Navy for nearly two years of testing off the coast of California. Since the drone ships’ inception, the Navy and Leidos have been hesitant to provide updates on its future role.', 'Secretary Work also noted the financial value of adding Sea Hunter to the Navy’s fleet.', 'Sea Hunter’s $20 million price tag is a fraction of the cost compared with a new Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, which would require approximately $1.6 billion in defense funds.', 'The drone ship also has an estimated operating cost ranging from $15,000 to $20,000 a day whereas a destroyer costs $700,000 a day to operate.', 'Carr notes, however, that Sea Hunter was not designed to replace naval vessels but collaborate with them.', '“People see something like Sea Hunter and they think you want to replace my ship, and it’s not that at all,” Carr said. “An autonomous thing does not replace a manned thing it augments. It’s not a one for one replacement.”', 'Last year, Leidos, was awarded a $35.5 million Navy contract to build the second unmanned vessel dubbed Sea Hunter II.', 'And while another drone ship is on the way, it remains to be seen what missions the Navy has envisioned for Sea Hunter and its sister.', '“The original model was that this would be an automatic submarine hunter,” Carr said. “What we learned along the way is that the real power wasn’t in any particular mission, it was having an autonomous pickup truck that could go away for long periods of time and have a persistent capability for whatever mission the Navy wants to do.”', 'Sea Hunter is currently not equipped with weapons, but Work, the former deputy Defense secretary, described a scenario in which one day it could be armed. ', '“We might be able to put a six pack or a four pack of missiles on them. Now imagine 50 of these distributed and operating together under the hands of a flotilla commander,” Work said. “This is going to be a Navy unlike any navy in history, a human-machine collaborative battle fleet that will confound our enemies.”']"

While Postmates has always had plans to branch out from its core food delivery business, the coronavirus pandemic and upcoming holidays hastened the retail rollout, said Mike Buckley, the new senior vice president of business. Buckley is a former Nike executive who was hired to head the effort.', '“Holiday shopping is a big driver of volume for merchants and so we wanted to get this solution to them as quickly as we could and help them tap into increased demand,” said Buckley.', 'Customers in Los Angeles, Postmates’ largest market, can access the channel through a new tab marked “retail” at the top of the company’s app. The initial launch includes boutique stores like Estee Lauder’s Le Labo, home goods retailer Parachute Home and men’s clothier Buck Mason. Postmates hopes to attract holiday shoppers who might be leery of visiting stores in-person.', 'In launching what the company calls a “virtual storefront,” Postmates is tapping into a largely unmined opportunity that has arisen during the pandemic — allowing small businesses, which have spent months either shuttered or scaled-down, the chance to sell their wares online without the burdensome cost of building their own delivery platforms.', 'The launch also pushes Postmates, which is in the process of being acquired by Uber, further into Amazon’s territory by offering customers an appealing alternative to the online retailer’s Prime shipping: Instant delivery.', '“We actually can deliver in some cases faster than Amazon,” said Buckley. “And the experience we’ve created helps create exposure to consumers, and then also creates an opportunity to deliver that product really rapidly.”', 'Other day-of delivery platforms are also testing out retail. Instacart recently announced a partnership with Sephora, while DoorDash — signaling a bid for holiday shoppers — has a new deal with Macy’s to provide same-day delivery from 500 Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s stores across the country through the retailer’s online platform.', '“Consumer habits are changing fast amidst the pandemic,” said Carly Brush, DoorDash’s director of retail. She said consumers want to know “how can they access the local shops in their cities that they used to visit in-person in hours, not days or weeks.”', 'The push into retail by same-day delivery companies follows a flurry of new deals that Postmates, Instacart and DoorDash have announced recently with drugstores and convenience store chains, such as Walgreens and 7-Eleven, to deliver household essentials. Those partnerships point to yet another business opportunity that arose for those platforms this spring — using their digital marketplaces to connect pandemic-challenged stores to customers turning to virtual shopping during the Covid-19 crisis.', 'While Covid-related closures have sharpened the need for customers to turn to digital platforms during the holidays, Buckley expects that even after the pandemic ends, many customers will continue to do leisure shopping on the platform.', '“I think the shift for consumers to shop more and more online and the desire for kind of instant gratification of those purchases is something that’s going to increase and will stay, increase post-pandemic,” said Buckley. “However, I do think that there’s this moment of increased demand, but also, I think it creates a little bit of a consumer pull to support local businesses.”']"

At the eMerge technology conference in  Miami last May, he said he believes the biggest mistake was that  the music industry didn’t partner up with Steve Jobs  and Apple.

Female founders and CEOs, female venture capitalists, and powerful figures such as Melinda Gates are banding together to raise more money for female-run companies, raise it through more diverse venture firms, build what they believe will be a new crop of billion-dollar businesses across a set of sectors from consumer to robotics and medicine, and hold on to more of the start-up equity that is currently being banked by the rich boys network of Silicon Valley.', 'The high-level numbers illustrating the industry’s gender gap are motivation enough.

Some is to avoid obvious criticisms, but they also are starting to realize they need to have a partner who does have a different viewpoint.”', 'All Raise had 1,500 female founders apply for 500 mentorships, and Quintini recalled that a common question centered on investors not understanding pitches involving products for female consumers, which made founders worried they needed to change the business. “Understand you are talking to the wrong person,” Quintini said.', '“These VC firms have to get past this idea that consumer companies are ‘nice little businesses,’” Lyne said. “I think we will see an increasing number of unicorns in the consumer space over the next five years and I do believe it will change the way VCs think about sourcing deals more than anything. A number of companies that are a little bit behind Stitch Fix and Eventbrite but are on the IPO track and once you get a half dozen, and then a dozen, with female founders ... that will change the ball game.”', 'This dynamic also is starting to reach the level of the retail store experience. A Tamara Mellon store is among the brands that opened last month at Palisades Village in Pacific Palisades, California, a retail village developed by Caruso with the goal of having female-led brands featured. Bulletin, a New York City-based Upstart 100 company that allows individual female-led brands to access physical store space that Bulletin leases and operates, now has 170 brands featured in its New York City locations.', '“It’s going to be what the future of retail looks like,” Layfield said.', 'Nancy Yu, co-founder and CEO of RDMD, a CNBC Upstart 100 company that aggregates de-identified patient data for use in disease research and development, worked as an investment banker on Wall Street earlier in her career, but it was not until she joined genetics analysis company 23andMe, run by Anne Wojcicki, that she learned to speak up. “In many ways I felt my confidence really took off during my years at 23andMe. Risk-taking and being outspoken would have been unacceptable as a rank-and-file investment banker. Almost half the team at 23andMe is seriously smart, strong-willed women.”', 'Jill Hagenkord, 23andMe’s former chief medical officer — and a “badass,” according to Yu — “showed me it was OK to speak my mind, even if it was edgy or even inappropriate. ... In my wedding vows, my husband said, ‘When I met you, you were a timid but smart banker, and now that’s completely changed.’ It was really through 23andMe,” Yu said.', '“Women have to feel comfortable building really big businesses,” said Alana Branston, co-founder and CEO of Bulletin.', 'Branston said she hears a lot about the average investment round size being lower for female founders, and about the overall funding level being lower, and the data can be “pretty depressing.” But it is just another hurdle to overcome and ultimately there is only one way to overcome it. “More women building big businesses is most effective way to change the dynamic,” she said. “So much of it is having confidence to know you can go and build something really big. Lots of female founders I know think of their model in terms of being a smaller idea while male founders feel more comfortable making grandiose statements. Building the next Airbnb or Uber would be hard, but female founders are capable of doing it.”', 'Bulletin is planning to expand next year to five more cities around the U.S., including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Austin and Boston.', '“I would never say women need to act more like men, but for many different reasons women are not as aggressive or assertive about how big a company can be and how fast; they don’t go into the pitch room with bravado,” Layfield said. “That goes against what VCs want. .. Being pragmatic makes us better entrepreneurs but can work against us in fundraising.”', 'For female founders fortunate enough to have avoided bad experiences with VCs and, to this day, have male investment partners and mentors instrumental to their success — and there are many of them, including many of the Upstart 100 companies interviewed for this article — the magnitude of the challenge and the avenues for progress can come outside the pitch meeting and after having already had much success.', 'Shirley Chen, the founder and CEO of Narrativ, an Upstart 100 advertising technology company that works with publishers of review sites to drive online consumer sales, had everything go right for her: Early childhood in Beijing, where math and science were part of a rigorous core curriculum that all girls and boys went through; attending the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria, Virginia, a top 10 high school in the U.S. with a STEM focus; and a job at McKinsey where she never had to think twice about speaking up in the room with a senior partner or senior public company executive.', 'Her realization came when her success at Narrativ led to a dinner invitation for top adtech executives: Chen was one of only two women at the exclusive industry dinner. She went back to work and had an intern compile a spreadsheet on the 50 largest adtech start-ups. Across the firms, which had raised closed to $4 billion in venture, not one had a female CEO.', '“I never knew what the stats were and the results were even more dramatic than I imagined,” Chen said. “Just because I didn’t experience it doesn’t mean it isn’t true.”', 'Now building her team at Narrativ, Chen also sees the issue arise when female engineers don’t negotiate over salary, and when seeing a pipeline of engineers that is only about 20 percent women. Chen said she has a better understanding now and Narrativ has made a commitment to keep its team gender-balanced and interviewing female engineers for senior roles. “When you’re under the gun to deliver on revenue it is so much easier to hire a senior engineer who is a guy than take a risk on a younger engineer who is a woman. But start-ups need to be cognizant of the tradeoffs they are making to ship a product next month.” She added, “Even though Narrativ is a small company with 30 employees, that can have a larger impact as you grow.”', 'Clara Vu, co-founder of Upstart 100 company Veo Robotics and a former iRobot engineer, said being a woman in engineering for two decades has often means figuring it out for yourself and feeling your way through the dark. Being the only woman in math classes or the only woman on an engineering team was the default. Many young female engineers, instead of moving up the leadership ladder, get sidelines into product liaison roles, “soft skills” positions, and that has led to a pipeline problem, not enough young women engineers encouraged to seek leadership.', 'Veo chooses its VC based on the ones that can best support its growth rather than on the makeup of the VC firm, but the firm and Vu are attuned to having a management team that is half women and Vu specifically, have one-quarter of the engineering team be female, which she said is well above average. “We are all used to being the only person in the bathroom,” she said.', 'Vu said she does not have a quantitative goal for the engineering team, especially as start-up trying to find the one person with the skill set you need and when you need them, and given the engineering population is majority male and specialized. “It would be hard to have a 50-percent female team, but I do think that I can definitely make an effort to get more diverse candidates in the door in the hiring process, reach out to women and other underrepresented people.” And she added that these candidates are often well above average, “because below average ones wouldn’t have made it that far.”', 'Having more women on the team can help to address one of the the biggest statistical gaps for women in the start-up community: male domination when it comes to the cap table, or in other words, who holds all the equity in firms.', 'A report released in late September by equity management software platform     Carta showed who really has the wealth in Silicon Valley: Women only hold 9 percent of employee and founder equity.', '“We’re not the ones that are going to be getting rich when these companies do well,” said Sara Mauskopf, a former Google employee and co-founder and CEO of parenting information platform Winnie. “Every way you look at it, women are not getting the wealth created in these companies, in a really disproportionate way,” she said. “All the advances made, getting women to work in tech and more female founders are not represented in terms of the wealth.”', 'The situation led Mauskopf to publish Winnie’s cap table, a move she said is unheard of in the industry. “Most companies would look bad if they published this information,” she said. Winnie’s cap table is over 70 percent female, split between employees, founders and VCs, and that is unusual and it was an intentional decision. “We wanted women to get wealthy, and we believe we are going to make a lot of money and we want that money going to women,” Mauskopf said.', 'The Winne CEO said in the same way most public companies now report on diversity measurements, she is hopeful that cap tables will become more public, and it is an agenda she will try to promote through larger organizations like All Raise and Founders for Change, though it will be a much slower change that broader diversity measures since start-ups and VCs “can’t just go and hire a bunch of women and minorities and see changes in the cap table.”', 'Many female founders stress that their most critical goal isn’t diversity, or worrying, but building their current venture to a successful exit. “I work my ass off, that’s the best thing I can do,” said Tamara Mellon CEO Layfield. “Building a big business will pave the way for it to be easier for the next female who asks for money.”', 'X Factor Ventures’ Palmer said the biggest takeaway for her VC firm one year after its launch was the realization of just how many women there are building interesting, venture-scale companies. “We knew there was a culture of women building start-ups but weren’t quite sure how large it was. The number of companies we’ve seen through partners or through email introductions is a little over a thousand,” she said. “The sheer volume was eye-opening. And we want to arm as many women as we can with checkbooks.”', 'Lyne said when BBG Ventures was launched four years ago, many peers in the VC community said it was a “nice goal” to start a fund that will invest in female founders, but they added, “There just aren’t enough of them to really sustain a fund for a long period of time.”', '“We have seen over 4,000 companies in four years with female founders,” Lyne said.', 'Disclosure: CNBC parent Comcast is an investor in Modsy.']"

104,Amazon Says It Puts Customers First. But Its Pricing Algorithm Doesn’t.,2016-09-20T15:19:19+0000,"['This article originally ran on ProPublica.org and is republished here with permission.', '  One day recently, we visited Amazon’s website in search of the best deal on  Loctite super glue, the essential home repair tool for fixing  everything from broken eyeglass frames to shattered ceramics.', '  In an instant, Amazon’s software sifted through dozens of  combinations of price and shipping, some of which were cheaper  than what one might find at a local store. TheHardwareCity.com,  an online retailer from Farmers Branch, Texas, with a 95 percent  customer satisfaction rating, was selling Loctite for $6.75 with  free shipping. Fat Boy Tools of Massillon, Ohio, a competitor  with a similar customer rating was nearly as cheap: $7.27with  free shipping.', '  The computer program brushed aside those offers, instead  selecting the vial of glue sold by Amazon itself for slightly  more, $7.80. This seemed like a plausible choice until another  click of the mouse revealed shipping costs of $6.51. That brought  the total cost, before taxes, to $14.31, or nearly double the  price Amazon had listed on the initial page.', '  What kind of sophisticated shopping algorithm steers customers to  a product that costs so much more than seemingly comparable  alternatives?', '  One that substantially favors Amazon and sellers it charges for  services, an examination by ProPublica  found.', ' More from ProPublica:  Company that sued soldiers settles Colorado lawsuitIllinois sues controversial drug maker over deceptive marketing practicesUncovering a $1 billion deal to detain unauthorized immigrants', '  Amazon often says it seeks to be “Earth’s most customer-centric  company.” Jeffrey  P. Bezos, its founder and CEO, has been known to put an empty chair in meetings  to remind employees of the need to focus on the customer. But in  fact, the company appears to be using its market power and  proprietary algorithm to advantage itself at the expense of  sellers and many customers.', '  Unseen and almost wholly unregulated, algorithms play an  increasingly important role in broad swaths of American life.  They figure in decisions large and small, from whether a person  qualifies for a mortgage to the sentence someone  convicted of a crime might serve. The weightings and variables  that underlie these equations are often closely guarded secrets  known only to people at the companies that design and use them.', '  But while the math is hidden from public view, the effects of  algorithms can be vast. With more than 300 million active  customer accounts and more than $100 billion in annual revenue,  Amazon is a shopping giant whose algorithm can make or break  other retailers. And so ProPublica set out to see how Amazon’s  software was shaping the marketplace.', '  We looked at 250 frequently purchased products over several weeks  to see which ones were selected for the most prominent placement  on Amazon’s virtual shelves — the so-called “buy box” that  pops up first as a suggested purchase. About three-quarters of  the time, Amazon placed its own products and those of companies  that pay for its services in that position even when there were  substantially cheaper offers available from others.', '  That turns out to be an important edge. Most Amazon shoppers end  up clicking “add to cart” for the offer highlighted in the buy  box. “It’s the most valuable small button on the Internet today,”  said Shmuli Goldberg, an Israeli technologist who has extensively  studied Amazon’s algorithm.', '  Amazon does give customers a chance to comparison shop, with a  listing that ranks all vendors of the same item by “price +  shipping.” It appears to be the epitome of Amazon’s  customer-centric approach. But there, too, the company gives  itself an oft-decisive advantage. Its rankings omit shipping  costs only for its own products and those sold by companies that  pay Amazon for its services.', '  We found that the practice earned Amazon-linked products higher  rankings in more than 80 percent of cases. Amazon’s offer of the  Loctite glue, a respectable No. 5 on the comparison list, dropped  to the 39th best deal when shipping was included. (The prices  Amazon shows are ranked correctly for those who pay $99 per year  for Amazon’s Prime shipping service and for those who are buying  $49 or more in eligible items.)', '  Erik Fairleigh, a spokesman for Amazon, said the algorithm that  selects which product goes into the “buy box” accounts for a  range of factors beyond price. “Customers trust Amazon to have  great prices, but that’s not all— vast selection,  world-class customer service and fast, free delivery are  critically important,” he said in an e-mailed statement. “These  components, and more, determine our product listings.” (Read  Amazon’s statement.)', '  Fairleigh declined to answer detailed questions, including  questions about why Amazon’s product rankings excluded shipping  costs only for itself and its paid partners.', '  The decision to allow non-Amazon companies to sell products on  the site was controversial within the company. But Bezos pushed  ahead, saying he was willing to lose sales if it made his company  more competitive in the long run. “If we side with the consumer  on that kind of decision,” he said at the 2007 annual shareholder  meeting, “over time it will force the right kind of behaviors on  ourself.”', '  At that meeting, a shareholder asked about Amazon’s practice of  promoting products sold by other companies on its website. Bezos  replied that the company had “very objective customer-centered  algorithms″ that automatically award the “buy box” to the lowest  price seller, provided “they actually have it in stock and can  deliver it.”', '  It is not clear why Amazon’s algorithm now pushes its own  products ahead of better deals offered by others. Perhaps Amazon  is taking the view that its widely admired shipping and delivery  offers the best possible satisfaction for customers, even if it  costs more.', '  Another possibility is that the company is trying to encourage  shoppers to join the Prime program, which offers free shipping on  many items (including the Loctite super glue). When non-Prime  customers initially view Amazon products, they are offered “FREE  Shipping on eligible orders.” When they reach the final page on  checkout, the shipping fees are revealed along with an  advertisement to avoid such fees by joining Prime.', '  The costs of simply buying the algorithm-selected choice can add  up. The average price difference between what the program  recommended and the truly cheapest price was $7.88 for the 250  products we tested. An Amazon customer who bought all the  products on our list from the buy box would have paid nearly 20  percent more — or about $1,400 extra — than if they had  bought the cheapest items being offered by other vendors.', '  Amazon’s algorithm also takes a toll on outside companies hoping  to sell products on the website. To increase their chances of  winning the buy box, many sellers are paying Amazon to warehouse  and ship their products through a program called “Fulfilled by  Amazon.” The fees for the program, which vary by size and weight  of the items being shipped, can amount to 10 to 20 percent of  sales.', '  Paying Amazon appears to be a sound strategy. Fulfilled by Amazon  vendors and Amazon itself were just about the only sellers —  94 percent of the cases we analyzed — that ever won the buy  box without having the cheapest product.', '  Through its rankings and algorithm, Amazon is quietly reshaping  online commerce almost as dramatically as it reshaped offline  commerce when it burst onto the scene more than 20 years ago.  Just as the company’s cheap prices and fast shipping caused a  seismic shift in retailing that shuttered stores selling books,  electronics and music, now Amazon’s pay-to-play culture is  forcing online sellers to choose between paying hefty fees or  leaving the platform altogether.', '  Consider BareBones WorkWear, a Sacramento clothing retailer that  has been selling on Amazon since 2004. This year, the company  removed nearly all of its items from Amazon, and shuttered a  warehouse and call center that were devoted to Amazon sales.', '  “Competition between us and Amazon is just insurmountable,”  BareBones chief operating officer Mason Moore said. The profit  margins for most clothing items were too low, he said, to allow  for the company to sell through the Fulfilled by Amazon, or FBA,  program. But, he said, “FBA is really the only avenue that we see  as any feasible way to do business with Amazon.” This week,  BareBones has just five items listed on Amazon — all of them  fulfilled by Amazon.', '  Last Christmas, so many vendors joined Fulfilled by Amazon that  the company ran out of space in some of its warehouses. This  year, the company has doubled its number of warehouses.', '  In July, Amazon reported record profits and the company’s chief  financial officer Brian Olsavsky told investors that Fulfilled by  Amazon growth was “really strong.”', '  Tech companies’ practice of favoring their own listings has  occasionally earned regulators’ scrutiny. The European  Commission, for example, has accused Google of violating EU  antitrust rules by favoring its own shopping service over those  of other vendors.', '  Amazon didn’t start as an open marketplace for online sellers.  When it opened its virtual doors in 1995, Amazon sold only its  own products. It began letting other vendors onto its product  listings in 2000.', '  “Our judgment was simple,” Bezos wrote of that decision, in a  2005 letter to shareholders. “If a third party could offer a  better price or better availability on a particular item, then we  wanted our customer to get easy access to that offer.”', '  For merchants, listing their wares on Amazon was a great  opportunity. Amazon attracted legions of customers, well worth  the 6 to 25 percent commission merchants paid the online colossus  on each sale.', '  By 2007, more than 1 million third-party sellers had joined  Amazon. Collectively, they generated about 30 percent of unit  sales, the company said at the time.', '  One of the sellers Amazon attracted was Kate Erkavun. She had  recently received a master’s degree in industrial engineer, but  also sold cosmetics on eBay out of her apartment while her  husband worked at an engineering company.', '  “I was young, I had just graduated,” she said. “I worked in a  pharmaceutical company and I quit after seven months. I realized  it wasn’t for me.” She started selling makeup on eBay, and then  migrated to Amazon, too.', '  At first, Erkavun’s listings on Amazon were similar to her eBay  listings — one page for each product that customers could  page through at leisure. But over time, Amazon simplified the  design so that customers would only be presented with one default  vendor for each product.', '  Amazon’s algorithm would choose which seller would win that  default position — the buy box. While the exact formulas  used to pick the winner were secret, Amazon’s website advises  sellers that they can increase their chances by having low  prices, having items in stock, offering free shipping and getting  excellent customer service ratings.', '  To optimize their chances, many sellers starting using  algorithmic software to constantly change prices to adapt to  competitors’ moves. Soon, Amazon became a highly dynamic  marketplace, similar to a stock-trading floor, where prices for  products changed as often as every 15 minutes.', '  Erkavun and her husband, Gokhan, were determined to increase  their chances of sales. Gokhan, who quit his job to help run the  business, worked with a programmer to write software that  repriced their products throughout the day. And the couple bought  a building in Nutley, New Jersey, to store their approximately  10,000 shampoos, lipsticks, lotions and other cosmetics in a  temperature-controlled warehouse. They offered free shipping,  quick turnaround times and worked hard to keep their customer  service ratings high.', '  At first, their techniques seemed to be successful. In 2010,  Amazon sales were half of their revenue and profits were at a  record high. “We were very happy,” said Gokhan.', '  But in 2011, he said, Beauty Bridge’s sales started slipping as  Amazon entered the cosmetics business and began consistently  winning the buy box. “If you don’t win the buy box, your chance  of selling is low,” Kate said.', '  Sellers who don’t win the buy box are placed on a page called  “More Buying Choices,” on a list that Amazon describes as ranked  by price plus shipping. However, since Amazon doesn’t include the  cost of shipping for itself and its fulfillment partners, the  rankings on that page can be misleading.', '  One day recently, for instance, Amazon was listed as the  top-ranked seller — both in the buy box and at the top of  the buying choices page — for a self-tanning lotion called  Vita Liberata. Beauty Bridge was offering the lowest price at  $27.03, but Amazon had won the buy box with an offer of $29.98.', '  When a customer put the lotion from Amazon in her cart, the added  shipping cost brought the total to $35.46. Beauty Bridge was  offering free shipping — so with or without shipping, its  offer should have been listed higher than Amazon’s. But it was  not.', '  When Gokhan Erkavun was told of his lotion’s poor ranking despite  its cheaper price, he just sighed and said, “Amazon is not really  fair in terms of competition, but we don’t have much choice. We  have to be there.”', '  On its Canadian website, Amazon discloses that its own items are  ranked without shipping price. But in the United States, Amazon’s  website states that “the default sort order of the offer listing  is ascending Price + Shipping.”', '  Of course, most Amazon customers never make it to the More Buying  Choices page where Beauty Bridge’s listing was ranked poorly.  Among the countless consultants and conferences devoted to  winning the buy box, it’s well known that Amazon’s algorithm  gives an advantage to itself, and to sellers who pay to join the  Fulfilled by Amazon program.', '  “Amazon definitely does weight things in favor of the FBA  seller,” said Michael Butcher, senior account manager at  SellerEngine Software, which sells algorithmic pricing software  for Amazon sellers. “It does seem unfair and it is sometimes hard  for merchants.”', '  For a few years, Amazon even advertised the advantage it offered  to its paid partners. According to Web pages stored by the  Internet Archive, the Amazon website said: “Because most FBA  listings are ranked without a shipping cost, you get an edge when  competing!” The language remained on the page from February 2013  through December 2015.', '  This year, the language has been changed to: “As you grow your  competitive edge, you can increase your chance of winning the Buy  Box.”', '  But Beauty Bridge’s Kate and Gokhan Erkavun didn’t want to pay  the fees to join the program. They had their own warehouse and  didn’t need Amazon’s. And they estimated the program would cost  them at least an additional 15 percent of sales.', '  They held out until 2014. By then, sales had slid 30 percent from  the peak in 2010. In 2014, “we got to a point where we couldn’t  survive without doing FBA,” Gokhan said. Since joining the  “Fulfilled by Amazon” program, Gokhan says the company’s sales  have recovered, but profits have not because of the fees.', '  Gokhan is now hoping that Wal-Mart’s recent purchase of online  shopping website Jet.com will increase the pressure on Amazon to  give small online retailers a better deal.', '  “We need Wal-Mart to really get serious about competing with  Amazon,” he said. “Otherwise in 10 years, we aren’t going to have  many retailers left.”', '— Story by Julia Angwin and Surya Mattu at ProPublica.org']"

That, however, will have its limitations as Australia won’t have sufficient coal to meet India’s growing needs, said analysts.', 'Coal accounts for around 70% of India’s electricity generation, according to the International Energy Agency’s 2021 India energy outlook report. The country is the world’s second-largest consumer and importer of coal, with China being the first.', 'Russia is the sixth-largest coal producer in the world. In 2020, 54% of the country’s coal exports went to Asia, while about 31% went to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries in Europe, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.', 'Before the war started, India bought very little coal from Russia, which accounted for only about 2% of India’s overall imports in 2021.', '“We are moving in the direction of importing coking coal from Russia,” Indian Steel Minister Ramchandra Prasad Singh told a conference in New Delhi, according to Reuters. He said the country had imported 4.5 million tonnes of coking coal from Russia, but did not indicate which period.', '“Despite warnings from the West, India continues to lean into their supply chain relationship with Russia for natural resources like oil and coal,” said Samir N. Kapadia, head of trade at government relations consulting firm Vogel Group. ', 'Kapadia said it would hinge on a currency swap agreement “to bypass some of the financing challenges in the market.” A currency swap line is an agreement between two central banks to exchange currencies, set up to improve liquidity conditions and provide foreign currency funding to domestic banks during periods of market stress.', 'Such a mechanism would allow India to buy Russian energy exports and other goods — even with Western sanctions restricting international payment mechanisms.', 'Several Russian banks have already been cut out of SWIFT, a global system connecting more than 11,000 member banks in some 200 countries and territories globally.', '“I don’t think they can get around the logistical issues with shipping, but a rupee-rouble currency swap would help,” Kapadia told CNBC in an email.', 'The U.S might consider sanctions and other measures on India if it doesn’t curtail its purchases of oil and coal from Russia, said Kapadia.', '“The White House has fired two ‘warning shots’ to date, pressuring India to be on the ‘right side of history’ and avoid aligning with Russia. There likely won’t be a third if this persists,” he said.', 'In recent weeks, top U.S. officials have reportedly warned New Delhi against a sharp rise in oil imports, Washington has warned that India will face significant consequences if it aligns itself with Moscow, according to reports.', 'India has also been snapping up cheaper oil from Russia as its purchases jump significantly, since the start of the war.', 'India’s coking coal import dependency has soared to around 85%, according to CBA’s Dhar.', 'A mega trade deal it signed with Australia early this month may bring some relief, but even that might be limited.', '“Australia just won’t be in a position to supply India the additional coking coal tonnes it requires for its growing steel production fleet because supply growth will be limited,” said Dhar.', 'Late last year, India was hit by a coal shortage as its power demand soared.', 'The only way is for Australia’s coking coal exports to shift away from other countries so that India can claim a bigger share — but that’s unlikely given that countries are now considering moving away from Russian coal, according to Dhar.', '“Given that South Korea, Japan and Europe are looking to diversify away from Russia (~10% of global coking coal exports), it’s even harder to build the case that demand for Australian coking coal will weaken from a major buyer in the foreseeable future,” Dhar said.']"

I couldn’t care less. Please sell our stock, don’t buy it.”', '“Tesla’s stock is unnerving, not for the faint of heart. I sure don’t like it,” Cramer said. “I think people don’t understand the risks that are associated with it and how emotional it can be.”', 'As markets swung lower, then higher on Thursday amid geopolitical worries, Cramer vetted a new thesis about what could be next in the U.S.-China trade clash.', '“The new thesis I’m hearing is that the president’s woes are making the Chinese more intransigent,” Cramer explained. “They’re beginning to take a longer view that Trump’s in real trouble and they can take more pain than we can and wait out the president.”', '“In other words, the Mueller investigation weakens the Trump hand, and it could actually hurt the global economy if it results in a prolonged trade war,” he continued.', 'President Donald Trump, whose personal lawyer Michael Cohen is at the center of a scandal involving adult film actress Stormy Daniels, revealed on Monday that he knew of a $130,000 payment Cohen made to Daniels ahead of the 2016 election.', 'When Cramer-fave MGM Resorts’ stock plummeted more than 11 percent after its earnings report last week, the CNBC host couldn’t believe his eyes.', '“The selling here has been extreme,” Cramer said on Thursday. “Whenever we see this kind of action, we need to ask ourselves, are we looking at a broken company here — which means sell, sell, sell — or is it merely a broken stock?”', '“In other words, is this the kind of development that makes you want to sell MGM for good, or are we merely getting a buyable pullback in a stock that still has a compelling long-term story?” he said.', 'Cramer has long recommended buying the stock of MGM, a hospitality giant with numerous hotel and casino properties in Las Vegas including the Bellagio and Mandalay Bay.

FedEx terminated its ground-delivery contract with Amazon, two months after ending its U.S. express shipping deal. Meanwhile, CVS and Walgreens were accused of unfairly blocking Amazon-owned PillPack’s access to certain prescription data.', 'This comes after several years of stories about retail rivals’ refusal to use Amazon’s AWS cloud service so they could avoid funding its most lucrative business.

That makes Amazon one of only three companies in the S&P 500, alongside Assurant and Diamondback Energy, to have perfect “buy” ratings. Even following last month’s earnings miss and lower-than-expected guidance, Amazon’s stock barely moved and didn’t see a single downgrade on its rating.

While most companies do one thing very well, Amazon has managed to build a leading position in two major categories — e-commerce and cloud business — and continues to invest in other areas like advertising.', 'For example, the recent investment in one-day shipping, which cost Amazon over $800 million in the second-quarter alone, showed immediate results with a huge bounce back in online sales, giving investors “greater comfort” in the company’s heightened spend, Srinivasan said.', '“From a technology investment point of view, I think Bezos has the greatest amount of respect from investors,” he said.', 'Still, analysts say there are a couple of growing risk factors for Amazon that they are keeping a close eye on.', 'One of them is the broader economic climate and the potential for a long-term recession. Although the main data points like employment and consumer spending point to a healthy economy, talks of a looming recession is keeping investors on edge, Srinivasan said. When there’s a recession, there’s a slowdown in revenue, and a big market correction usually follows. And consumer companies like Amazon tend to be more exposed to those downturns than enterprise companies like Microsoft or Oracle, who get the bulk of their revenue from business customers, he said.', '“It’s a cloud on the horizon that’s worth monitoring,” Srinivasan said.', 'The bigger concern, perhaps, is the regulatory environment surrounding Amazon. The antitrust probe and calls for breaking up Amazon still have a long way to go before becoming a major risk for Amazon, analysts say, but there’s always a chance that a compelling case could emerge and threaten the company. Jason Helfstein, an analyst at Oppenheimer, said Amazon seems to have less immediate antitrust risk than Facebook and Google, but nonetheless it’s an issue that keeps investors worried.', '“Just in general, investors don’t love the whole climate around regulation in Washington D.C. and the rest of the world,” Helfstein said.', 'Follow @CNBCtech on Twitter for the latest tech industry news.']"

The popularity of increasingly advanced mobile games is driving demand for better hardware, and a few companies are stepping into the arena with phones designed specifically for gaming.', 'While the vast majority of current smartphones support casual games — think Candy Crush and Pokémon Go — these new phones are targeting players of competitive online and graphically intensive games like Fortnite and PUBG Mobile.', 'The world’s most popular phones, like the Apple iPhone and the Samsung Galaxy line, have high-end hardware specifications capable of handling sophisticated games. In August, Samsung launched its latest “phablet,” the Galaxy Note 9, advertising it as gaming-friendly and highlighting increased battery life and quick cooling.', 'However, the top mainstream phones are not conducive to serious mobile gaming.', '“One doesn’t have to have a gaming phone in order to play these games. But one doesn’t have to have a gaming PC in order to play many PC games, either. And yet PC gamers will opt for more optimized hardware to give them that extra edge,” Bryan Ma, vice president of client devices research at IDC, said via email. “Gaming phones won’t necessarily appeal to more mainstream users, but some enthusiasts will look for specs like high-refresh-rate screens to give themselves a better experience.”', 'Gaming hardware company Razer is betting that the market for gaming phones is for real. Headquartered in San Francisco and Singapore, the company is known for selling PC and console-gaming peripherals, as well as its own line of gaming laptops. Following generally positive reviews on its first smartphone, which debuted in November 2017, the company launched a successor on Oct. 10. While many products in the mobile phone market are rounded, Razer’s design language is more square.', 'Samsung’s Galaxy S8 popularized the concept of minimizing bezels, the borders between a phone’s screen and its frame. Other Android phones followed, with makers such as Essential, LG and Huawei releasing their own almost bezel-less phones. Apple then heated up the race to maximize screen real estate with the iPhone X’s smaller bezels and notch, a trend now making its way to Android phones, like Google’s Pixel 3 and the OnePlus 6.', 'While the notch and lack of bezels are considered design enhancements by many, they may not be favorable to mobile gamers who often hold the device horizontally in their hands and need to see as much of the screen as possible. Top and bottom bezels provide a place for gamers to grip the phone and help position their thumbs.', '“Ultimately, we did a lot of study and research and realized that actually, a square design is very comfortable. Because of the way the hand holds it, the corners don’t really affect the use case,” said Stéphane Blanchard, director of industrial design at Razer.', 'With the square design set, the Razer team decided that the best place to put the powerful stereo front-facing speakers — an important feature for gamers — was on bezels to the left and right of the screen when held horizontally.', '“We have a blocky design, and we have big bezels. All combined, it is actually a great advantage because we have a great grip where we still hold the edges without covering the speakers to have great sound,” Blanchard said.', 'With this distinctive bulky design and bezels, Razer is “bucking the trend,” said Matt Swider, a senior editor at technology news and review site TechRadar.', 'Both the new Razer Phone 2 and its predecessor boast the best screen refresh rate of any phone, at 120Hz. High screen refresh rates provide smoother experiences and allow for potentially quicker response times helpful in fast-paced games. Apple’s iPad Pros have this feature, but even the newest iPhones are capped at 60Hz.', '“The difference you see in a high-refresh-rate display is not just tied to gaming.

Another new feature is the ultrasonic “AirTriggers” — extra programmable touch points on the edges of the phone screen that serve the same function as game-controller buttons when held horizontally. (Physical game controllers can be attached to the sides of the phone.)', '“Games require certain controls, so we started to think about what we can offer to add in the controls people are accustomed to, but without adding all the extra complexity,” Lien said.', 'Asus is selling a variety of accessories for the phone that cost up to several hundred dollars each, including a “TwinView Dock” that adds another screen (for $399.99), a “Mobile Desktop Dock” that can connect the phone to a computer monitor in order to game with a mouse and keyboard (for $229.99).', '“A lot of gamers don’t game on one device only. It’s about this interoperability between their devices on the go and the device they use primarily in a stationary environment,” Lien said. “The ability to control their own gaming experience is one of the most appealing things about the ROG phone.”', 'These gaming phones are also differentiating themselves from Apple and Samsung with better cooling mechanisms and bigger batteries to allow prolonged playing time.', '“The ability to not overheat is really crucial to having a good gaming phone,” Swider said. “That is how Razer and other phone makers can rival an iPhone or a Samsung phone that obviously has more mainstream appeal right now.”', 'The Razer and ROG phones both use custom vapor chamber cooling technology to disperse heat from the chipset and sustain performance, with Razer adapting the thermal system used in its gaming laptops. Asus is even including an external “AeroActive Cooler” accessory that mounts on the side port.', 'For all their gaming-optimized features, these devices still need to handle all the regular smartphone needs as users carry them around, in order to gain any traction in the competitive phone market.', 'Razer incorporated feedback from its first phone to make the second generation more viable as a daily driver, including significantly improving the camera — a point of much criticism in the predecessor, brightening the screen for better outdoor use and adding wireless charging, an increasingly common mainstream feature.', 'But the gaming designs come at a cost in terms of bulkiness. “These are not thin and light gaming phones,” Swider said. “They are akin to gaming laptops, whereas the iPhone is more like a thin MacBook Air.”', 'Asus isn’t shy about marketing to the high-end gamer segment of the market and betting that these consumers will pay significantly more for accessories. “The phone still functions perfectly like a phone, but we wanted to be known as a gaming phone and not as an all-purpose phone that also does gaming,” Lien said.', 'The price point of the Razer and Asus ROG phones will create pressure from both above and below, according to Jeff Fieldhack, a research director at Counterpoint Technology Market Research. The Razer Phone 2 starts at $799 — $100 more than its predecessor — while the ROG Phone starts at $899, with the cooling accessory included. Both will have more expensive versions with extra storage available.', 'These prices are comparable with Apple and Android flagship phones, many of which have the same top line processor in the most recent models.', 'The phone market’s lower tier now includes models optimized for gaming with sufficient frame rates and audio quality and large displays. “These devices will not offer the most optimal gaming experience, but more importantly, they come in around $300 and can play games like PUBG, Honor of Kings, Doupo Cangqiong, Pokémon GO, etc., smoothly enough,” Fieldhack said via email.', 'The popularity of Chinese technology giant Tencent’s Honor of Kings, which has an estimated 200 million monthly players, and other mobile games have also fueled the rise of gaming phones from Chinese manufacturers around this price point, though few are available outside the price-sensitive Asian market.', 'Research firm Canalys estimates that the Razer phone shipped fewer than 100,000 units globally since it launched last November.', '“There are some things the Razer phone can do that the most recent Samsung and Apple flagships cannot,” Fieldhack said. “However, the faster refresh speed will not be enough for subscribers in the Galaxy or iPhone camp to ditch their ecosystem choice for a gaming phone.”', '—By Erica Yee, special to CNBC.com', 'WATCH: What happened when I tried to get an Apple iPhone 6 battery replaced']"

And do you know, we’ve got the store that you’re in that’s very focused on having the best customer experience there, helping people set up their new phone, making sure all their data’s transferred, and also-- allowing them to trade in their current phone, which begins to look like a subsidy that the carrier may have previously provided. And it offsets some of the cost of the new phone.', 'CRAMER: Okay, so these issues are all occurring at the same time that we do have China. You were very abject about China and the 100 percent of the upside that went away. There are issues involving perhaps, not boycotts, we know that’s off the table, but patriotism, in a strange way, meaning that, you know what? If I can get a Huawei with a subsidy, why should I buy an Apple that’s conspicuously American. How long can that last?', 'COOK: Well, I think here’s what we saw in China in specifically. The Chinese economy, it seemed to us, began to slow, maybe, in the second half of the year. And it was on some sort of rational trajectory. We believe, based on what we saw and the timing of it, that the tension, the trade-war tension with the U.S. created this more-sharp downturn.', 'I believe that’s temporary. Because I think that, when you really look at it, it’s in both countries’ best interests to come to an agreement. It is a complex, very complex trade agreement. And it needs to be updated. But as I’ve said before, I’m very optimistic that this will happen. And so that clearly will be good, not only for us, frankly, but I think more about the world in general. The world needs a strong U.S. and China economy for the world economy to be strong.', 'CRAMER: My understanding is even the hardliners in the White House have moved on this issue. Now I know that President [Donald] Trump calls you a friend, I know that you go back and forth because you’re represent the greatest that we have in America. And my understanding is that there are people who feel exactly like you, which means a deal’s possible.', 'COOK: I think a deal is very possible. And I’ve heard some very encouraging words.', 'CRAMER: Even of recent, right?', 'COOK: Yes, yes, very recently. And I don’t speak for them, obviously. I do talk with them. And I give them my ideas and thoughts.', 'CRAMER: Okay, now, we gotta talk about some of these people who, the naysayers. And we’ve dealt with them before, when the stock was substantially lower. A Wedbush analyst said Apple’s clearly the darkest days, representing a challenge in growth. Journal, It’s too soon to call the XR a flop, only after a few months. But early indications are, of course, it’s a flop. What do you say to people who say XR flopped? What do you say to, say, darkest days?', 'COOK: I say bologna. I call bologna on that. Let me tell you how I view this. Here’s the truth, what the facts are. Since we began shipping the iPhone XR, it has been the most popular iPhone every day, every single day, from when we started shipping, until now.', 'CRAMER: But how about relatively? I mean, there’s been other ones that have —', 'COOK: I mean, do I want to sell more? Of course I do. Of course I’d like to sell more. And we’re working on that. But in terms of the product itself, it’s an incredibly innovative product. It has a bunch of advanced technologies in it from the chip with the neural engine to security embedded to an edge-to-edge liquid retina display, the first in the industry, longest battery life ever in an iPhone.', 'I mean, it is unbelievable. And the photos that you can take of your life and of your loved ones, I mean, it beats many, many of the standalone cameras that you could buy now that nobody uses anymore. And so these things give a lot of value to the customer. So that’s that.', 'In terms of the naysayer, I’ve heard this over and over again, Jim. I’ve heard it in 2001. I’ve heard it in 2005 and ’07 and ‘08 and ‘10 and ‘12 and ’13. You can probably find the same quotes from the same people over and over again. And I’m not defensive on it. This is America. And you can say what you want. But I’m giving you my honest opinion is that there is a culture of innovation in Apple. And that culture of innovation, combined with these incredible-- loyal customers, happy customers, this ecosystem, this virtuous ecosystem, is something that is probably underappreciated.', 'CRAMER: Well, then you were surprised with the market reaction to both when you decided to not reveal units and when you revealed the shortfall.', 'COOK: I’m never surprised by the market, to be honest with you. Because I think the market is quite emotional in the short term. And we sorta look through all of that. We think about the long term. And so when I look at the long-term health of the company, it has never been better.', 'The product pipeline has never been better. The ecosystem has never been stronger. The services are on a tear. If you look at, let’s just take wearables as an example, right? Wearables, it’s mainly the Apple Watch and AirPods.', 'If you look at this, and on a trailing basis. I’m not projecting. On a trailing basis, they’ve we’ve already exceeded the revenue for wearables is already more than 50 percent more than iPod was at its peak. Now, this is a product that I think everybody would say it was an incredibly important product for Apple, full of innovation, and probably, the trigger for the company getting on a very different trajectory and into other markets.', 'And so already, exceeded it by 50 percent at its peak. At its peak. Also, if you take AirPods and the Watch separately, and you sort of back these up and align it to the launch date of iPod, as well, and, you know, where all of them have a comparable amount of time, you would find that each one, independently, is, like, four to six times ahead of where iPod was at a comparable period of time.', 'And so AirPods are becoming ubiquitous out there. People love them. I get notes every day. They’re chock full of tech. But they just work. It’s the elegance of them, but with significant technology and built right in and an unbelievable user interface.', '[Break]', 'CRAMER: I’ve been following stocks for 40 years, Tim. And you guys are a fountain of innovation. My wife said, “Tell him, what do they want? Time travel?” (LAUGHTER) What do you have to do?', 'COOK: Hey, time travel sounds kinda cool.', 'CRAMER: Right? The reason I mention it is because there are companies that sell at 22 to 23 times earnings, they are the consumer packaged goods companies. There are companies that tend to go from 1 to 4 percent. If they get 5%, then they get a 28 multiple.', 'And yet, the analysts who follow your company continue to look for units of phones, they’re not thinking about the revenue. And yet, if it were Procter & Gamble, and they got that many razor blades, they’d pay 28 times earnings. Are you followed by the wrong people?', 'COOK: I think that our story isn’t well understood. I think Apple is not well understood in some of Wall Street. For example, I think there are several people that believe the most important metric is how many iPhones are sold in a given 90-day period or what the revenues is.', 'This is far, far, far down my list. The point is, if somebody decides to buy an iPhone a little later, because of the battery, huge discount that we gave, they decide to hold on a little longer, I’m I’m great with that.', 'I want the customer to be happy. We work for them. And so the important thing is that they’re happy. Because if they’re happy, they will eventually replace that product with another. And the services and the ecosystem around that will thrive.', 'CRAMER: But as long as it’s north of 60 percent, I mean, as long as cell phones are north — I don’t know how you get people to think, even if it’s $20 billion in service revenue. It’s the 62 percent. It is overwhelming. And they don’t know what to do. And I understand their conundrum, Tim. They don’t know what to do. Because the cell phone’s such a big part of the pot.', 'COOK: Yeah, but if you really back up and look at Apple — in our last fiscal year, we had $100 billion of revenue that was not iPhone, $100 billion. And in this last quarter, if you take everything outside of iPhone, it grew at 19 percent. Nineteen percent on a huge business.', 'CRAMER: That’s — again, it’s a consumer packaged goods company but not a tech. Why not accept it and say, “You know what? We’re just — we wanna be covered by other people”?', 'COOK: (LAUGH) I don’t think we get to pick who we’re covered by —', 'CRAMER: Well, I don’t know. You’re a big company. Maybe you could. Now, I’ve got some ideas for you, okay? I talked to some people at Walmart yesterday. An arrangement with Walmart, Flipkart to take over India with a budget phone, rather than doing it piecemeal.', 'COOK: Yeah. For us, we’re about making the best product that enriches people’s lives. And so we’re not about making the cheapest, right? We want to make a great value. But that’s not necessarily the cheapest. And so for us, what we’ve seen is there’s enough people in every country in the world that we play in that we can have a really good business by selling the best phones.', 'Now, the best phones, we knew that, as we went to the X and then the follow-on of the XS and the XS Max, that everybody would not want to spend $1,000 for the phone. So we made the iPhone XR. And we put as many of the advanced technologies as we could in that phone--', 'CRAMER: Well, let Flipkart do the subsidy.', 'COOK: And we priced it right between the 8 and the 8 Plus of the year before. But in India, in general, we are all in. It is a major focus. If you look at how we’ve done, over the years, we’ve gone from a $100, $200 million business to, last year, we exceeded $2 billion.', 'That $2 billion was flat, year over year, after rapid, rapid growth. And so we have more work to do. We’d like to put stores there. We would like some of the duties and so forth that are put on the products to go away. And we’re working closely with the team there. And I believe that we’ll have better results at some point in the future. I’m not in the forecasting mode here today. But it’s an important market for us.', 'CRAMER: You have people who are naysayers. One of the naysayers is not an analyst. It’s Qualcomm. Qualcomm keeps telling you, over and over again, “You’re gonna come to the table. You have to. Lost the suit in Germany. Lost the suit in China. Wait ’til you see them cave.” Are you gonna cave?', 'COOK: No. Look, the truth is, we haven’t been in any settlement discussions with them since the third calendar quarter of last year. That is the truth. So I’m not sure where that thinking is coming from. The issues that we have with Qualcomm is that they have a policy of no license, no chips. This is, in our view, illegal. And so many regulators in many different countries agree with this. And then secondly, the obligation to offer their patent portfolio on a fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory basis. And they don’t do that. They charge exorbitant prices. And they have a lot of different tactics they use to do that. And that’s not just us saying that. I mean, you can see what’s coming out of the FTC trial here in the United States. And obviously, I have an issue with some of their other tactics that I’m sure you’ve read about.', 'CRAMER: Right, that they say you are in settlement talks all the time.', 'COOK: Well, not just that, but paying somebody to write fake news and then promoting it. This is stuff that should be beneath companies. This is not how things should operate.', 'CRAMER: All right, so let’s talk about competition. The other company that I think of innovation I always have to talk about is Amazon. And they do great voice. You have voice. It’s a bit of a contest. If you had sort of unlimited capital, and you throw it at voice, would it make Siri even better?', 'COOK: Well, we’re putting a ton of investment in Siri. And so if you look at Siri today, Jim, we have about a bit over 500 million devices that are using Siri out there, Siri enabled. And Siri’s used over 10 billion times a month. And it’s in 21 different languages and 30-something countries.', 'And so we’ve tried to do we tried to create a global product. We’re not in every country yet. We want to be. And if if you want something that is something that has been created in your device, Siri is the best place to do that.', 'I get more and more great things every day. The quality is is going up. You know voice is a never-ending journey. We all speak a bit differently. I have a southern dialect, not as southern as I used to. But there’s a lot of stuff to do there. But I’m highly confident in our ability to keep innovating like crazy there.', 'CRAMER: Okay last question. Healthcare, if you hooked up with different — could you make it so that I can sync — I need to sync — I need the handshake with my doctor, okay? And payments, it’s gonna be huge. If you look at a PayPal, they’ve got a 30 multiple...can you layer either one of those on to be able to jump, even though it’s huge, the service stream, make it so that it’s 40% of your company, by doing more in payments, more in health?', 'COOK: On services, you will see us announce new services this year. There will more things coming. I don’t wanna tell you about what they are —', 'CRAMER: Material?', 'COOK: I believe it’ll be material over time. I’m not gonna forecast precisely, the ramps and so forth. But they’re things that we feel really great about, that we’ve been working on for multiple years. On the healthcare, in particular, and sorta your wellbeing, this is an area that I believe, if you zoom out into the future, and you look back, and you ask the question, “What was Apple’s greatest contribution to mankind,” it will be about health.', 'Because our business has always been about enriching people’s lives. And as we’ve gotten into healthcare more and more through the Watch and through other things that we’ve created with ResearchKit and CareKit and putting your medical records on the iPhone, this is a huge deal.', 'And it’s something that is very important for people. We are democratizing it. We are taking what has been with the institution and empowering the individual to manage their health. And we’re just at the front end of this.

127,Major quake disaster in Southern California could cause $300 billion in losses,2017-09-27T22:11:14+0000,"['Mexico City’s earthquake disaster is a reminder of the serious risk of Southern California’s “Big One” striking at any time and causing widespread damage that some estimate could approach upwards of $300 billion.', 'Experts say Southern California is long overdue for a major earthquake along the 800-mile San Andreas Fault, which could cause extensive damage and loss of life to the nation’s second-largest city and the region. It also could be a supply-chain nightmare to U.S. businesses, since the L.A./Long Beach port complex handles more than 30 percent of loaded containers that move through all U.S. ports.', '“As a state, California is probably one of the better-prepared places on Earth in terms of preparation for earthquakes,” said Mary Comerio, past president of the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute and a University of California-Berkeley professor specializing in disaster recovery and reconstruction. “That said, financially these things are huge hits now.”', 'Mexico City’s 7.1-magnitude quake on Sept. 21 toppled buildings, damaged public infrastructure and killed more than 220 people. It was four times stronger than the 6.7-magnitude Northridge earthquake in 1994, a Los Angeles-area disaster along a previously undetected fault that took more than 60 lives and caused about $44 billion in damage.', '“The Northridge earthquake was considered to be moderate,” said Robert de Groot, a staff scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey field office in Pasadena, California. “For California, our big earthquakes are typically in the high magnitude 7s.”', 'According to the USGS scientist, a 180-mile rupture along the southern portion of the state’s San Andreas Fault could produce the “Big One,” a 7.8-magnitude earthquake. He said it would be felt “pretty widely throughout the state” and even as far as Las Vegas but “the worst shaking will be in the Los Angeles basin.”', '“We are expecting a very large earthquake on the San Andreas Fault,” de Groot said. “We don’t know when this earthquake will take place, but it’s a very good candidate as a place where a big earthquake will happen eventually.”', 'A spokesperson for AIR Worldwide told CNBC the catastrophe-modeling firm conducted an earthquake model analysis and found simulated events impacting California could result in “upwards of $300 billion in total ground-up losses to properties.”', 'An analysis by CoreLogic, a global data analytics firm, specifically looked at a large quake along the San Andreas Fault and in November estimated it could impact the northern and southern portions of California simultaneously. CoreLogic said an earthquake of magnitude 8.3 along the feared fault could result in a full rupture and damage up to 3.5 million homes, resulting in reconstruction cost values of $289 billion.', 'By comparison, CoreLogic estimated Hurricane Irma and Harvey damage would run in the tens of billions of dollars. Most of the property estimated to be damaged by flood is uninsured.', 'In California, only about 10 percent of the homeowners have earthquake insurance. ', 'On average, big quakes happen on segments of the San Andreas statewide roughly every 150 years, but parts of the fault system in the south near L.A. have not had a rupture for over 300 years.', 'For Southern California, a significant quake could damage infrastructure at the ports as well as airports. That could result in a ripple effect not only on the state’s economy but on the nation’s since major retailers, manufacturers and others rely on the L.A.-area ports to stay in business.', 'Additionally, rail lines that carry the goods from ports, as well as the highways and bridges that the trucks use, could suffer devastating damage in a big quake and take weeks or months to repair.', '“We could be up and running here after a major quake and have all of our ships coming in and going, but there could be a problem with rail or highways that doesn’t allow the goods to leave the port or get to the port,” said Phillip Sanfield, a spokesman for the Port of Los Angeles, the nation’s largest port complex.', 'Parts of the cargo terminals and harbor facilities of the L.A.-area port complex are built on artificial landfills and areas with known seismic activity. As the ports have increased volumes and cargo ship sizes over the years, they have outgrown existing spaces and been forced to create new land.', 'The shaking on areas with land reclamation increases the liquefaction potential and ground failure when loose or water-saturated soils shake. Indeed, the huge 9.0-magnitude earthquake in Japan in 2011 caused major liquefaction on reclaimed land in Tokyo.', '“We’re very cognizant of the fact that we’re in an earthquake-prone region,” said Duane Kenagy, interim deputy executive director of the Port of Long Beach. He said standards have been developed over the years for the engineering and construction of the port facilities that take into consideration the location and seismic risk.', 'If there was damage from a significant quake to the L.A. port complex, though, they could attempt to move ships to other terminals or even divert vessels to other West Coast ports, such as Oakland.', 'Other infrastructure also is at risk, and an earthquake could have lasting effects.', 'There’s the potential for natural gas and water lines to break, which is what happened during the Northridge quake. The broken gas lines could create thousands of fires that could overwhelm emergency responders after a major temblor.', 'Another frightening possibility is an earthquake could cut off a major water supply for L.A. and other parts of Southern California, where more than 23 million people live. The region gets about 70 percent of its water delivered through three aqueducts that cross the San Andreas Fault, and a study by the L.A. Mayor’s Office several years ago revealed that a 7.8-magnitude quake could cripple that water supply for 15 months.', 'There’s also concern about the stability of levees in Northern California that form the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, the hub of the state water system that provides water to about 25 million Californians and to millions of acres of agriculture in the Central Valley. San Francisco Bay and Silicon Valley areas of the state also could be affected since they draw on that water from the delta.', 'The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, a water wholesaler for nearly 19 million people, uses the Colorado River Aqueduct and said it could recover in six months from a disruption if there’s a big quake on the southern portion of the San Andreas fault. Chief Engineer Gordon Johnson said MWD has a reservoir it built in the late 1990s that carries a six-month emergency supply of water for Southern California and there are also groundwater basins to tap into during a water emergency.', 'Finally, a major earthquake in California could trigger tsunamis and makes heavily populated areas along the coast especially vulnerable. The threat of a tsunami isn’t limited to the southern half of the state since Northern California includes part of the 680-mile long Cascadia fault capable of megaquakes of magnitude 9.0.']"

The Trump administration is making it a priority to assure U.S. companies scoop up a significant share of the business.', 'In May, the U.S. Commerce Department and Beijing reached an agreement that will allow Chinese firms to strike long-term contracts with American producers of liquefied natural gas.', 'U.S. capacity to process LNG, or natural gas cooled to liquid form, is set to grow nearly seven-fold by 2019 as five export terminals open. Exporting more of that LNG is a central pillar of Trump’s plan to achieve “energy dominance.”', 'The United States will have to compete with Qatar, Malaysia and Australia, which dominate global LNG sales, as well as Russia, which ships gas to China by way of pipeline. But there are signs that there’s room for American suppliers in the fastest-growing market for LNG.', '', 'American LNG shipments to China are rising this year, according to a report from the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission. The U.S. shipped $139 million of LNG to China in the first seven months of this year. That tops last year’s total U.S. LNG exports to China of $137 million.', 'The opportunity exists because U.S. transport costs to Asia are low right now, and Asian LNG prices have fallen to the weakest level in more than a decade.', 'That is encouraging China to buy natural gas instead of coal. China’s five-year economic plan calls for the country to use less coal and more natural gas to generate power. Despite the recent gains and the agreement with Trump, Chinese buyers are still only purchasing U.S. LNG from third parties in short-term spot trades. And there is currently only one company, Cheniere Energy, capable of exporting large shipments of LNG from the United States.', 'Cheniere CEO Jack Fusco and Texas LNG Chief Operating Officer Langtry Meyer are joining the Trump delegation. The companies did not respond to questions about their agenda in China, but energy research firm Wood Mackenzie said securing commitments is likely at the top of Trump’s list.', '', '“The fact that Trump will arrive in Beijing with a large business delegation in tow, including a sizeable contingent from the energy sector, indicates that the White House is looking to secure concrete commercial agreements from the upcoming trip,” Kerry-Anne Shanks, head of Asia gas and LNG at Wood Mackenzie, said in an email briefing on Tuesday.', 'Chinese natural gas demand could grow from 206 billion cubic meters last year to 330 billion cubic meters in 2020, according to Wood Mackenzie. The firm expects LNG to account for about a third of China’s growing consumption through 2025.', 'The United States has faced some obstacles but also boasts advantages in capturing part of that growth.', 'On the one hand, Chinese LNG buyers can potentially find a better deal elsewhere and may not want to expose themselves to U.S. gas prices, said Hugo Brennan, Asia analyst at risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft. There are also large fixed costs to liquefying and shipping LNG from the United States, and American companies will have to contend with lower-cost LNG expansions in Qatar and Australia, Brennan added. Shortly after the Commerce Department reached the agreement with China, Qatar announced plans to hike its natural gas exports 30 percent by 2024. Some analysts think China won’t end up buying much LNG from the United States and will instead use the option to gain leverage over Qatar in price negotiations.', '', 'But U.S. LNG shippers can offer customers more flexibility in terms of shipment volumes, and American deals have allowed buyers to sell off their purchases to others, Brennan notes.', '“China aims to maintain a well-diversified portfolio of gas suppliers and U.S. imports could help ensure that Beijing does not become too dependent on any one state. U.S. supplies could help reduce China’s reliance on gas imports that transit strategic chokepoints,” Brennan said in a note on Tuesday.', 'Wood Mackenzie also flags growing cooperation between China and Russia, which can send natural gas to its southern neighbor through pipelines at a discount to U.S. overseas shipments.', 'Despite the existence of latent pressure points, Sino-Russian ties have warmed considerably under Xi Jinping and there is a deal of synergy between Moscow’s ‘Pivot to Asia’ and Beijing’s ‘Belt and Road Initiative,’” the firm says. “Energy cooperation has developed into the central plank of the bilateral relationship.”', 'Supply from China itself could also be an obstacle. China has the world’s largest technically recoverable reserves of shale gas, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

130,How Russian gas became Europe’s most divisive commodity,2018-07-17T18:28:21+0000,"['Lubmin is a picturesque resort on Germany’s Baltic Sea coast that boasts a long stretch of sandy beach bordered by soft dunes and a lush pine forest. Located a few hours north of Berlin, the town offers tourists a postcard version of seaside tranquility. Or it would, were it not for the fleet of excavator barges that sails out from the local port every day, and the large building site hiding behind the pines.', 'Both are part of a fiercely contentious project that has split Europe down the middle, and set Germany on a collision course with some of its closest allies. Out in the sea, the excavator barges are digging a massive underwater trench that runs in a straight line towards the building site on land. If all goes to plan, that trench will soon hold a pipeline filled with the most explosive commodity in European politics today: Russian gas.', 'The Nord Stream 2 pipeline has been in planning since 2015, and is due for completion in late 2019. Its defenders argue the project makes perfect commercial sense: the pipeline will connect the world’s biggest exporter of natural gas with the largest economy in Europe, doubling the capacity of the existing trans-Baltic link, Nord Stream 1, which has been operational since 2011. Together, the two pipelines will eventually be able to carry 110bn cubic meters a year of natural gas, enough to meet almost a quarter of total demand across the EU.', 'Critics regard the pipeline — and Germany’s role in it — as an act of betrayal and a geopolitical folly of the first order. Countries such as Poland and Ukraine have denounced it as a blatant attempt to marginalize their own gas pipelines — and a reckless move that will leave them and the rest of Europe at the mercy of Moscow. The European Commission is another opponent of Nord Stream, arguing the project undermines its push for greater energy independence and more diversified supplies.', 'The most formidable adversary, however, sits in Washington. President Donald Trump has made clear repeatedly that he wants to stop the €9.5bn ($11,071,775,000 US) project — and that he is ready to impose tough sanctions to achieve that goal. Last week, Mr. Trump launched a blistering attack on the new pipeline at the Nato summit in Brussels, warning that Germany had become “captive to Russia, because it’s getting so much of its energy from Russia.”', 'Kirsten Westphal, an energy analyst at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, likens Nord Stream 2 to an “onion” — you peel away layer after layer of controversy only to discover that the next one is more contentious still. At its core, however, the pipeline poses a simple but crucial question: should the west trust Russia or not?', '“Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the war in Ukraine have changed everything,” says Ms. Westphal. “For many people in the west, the idea that Russia is a dependable partner has gone. There is doubt: given all the geopolitical tensions, should we further expand our energy relationship with Russia? Should we make a bet, despite it all, to keep the channel open?”', 'For reasons of history as well as naked economic self-interest, that question tends to find a different answer in Germany than in other European countries and the US. It is summed up neatly by Axel Vogt, the mayor of Lubmin and — like most locals — an enthusiastic backer of Nord Stream. “For us, Russia has always been a reliable business partner. And we don’t see any sign that this is changing despite all that is happening on the big political stage,” he says. “For Lubmin, Nord Stream means jobs, it means contracts for local businesses and it means more business taxes,” the mayor says.', 'He adds that this affection for Russia goes beyond economic gain, and reflects ties forged in the time when Lubmin was part of communist East Germany. “Before reunification there was a very close relationship with Russia . . . and they want it to stay that way.”', 'For now the project enjoys the official support of the German government (as well as the unconditional backing of the Kremlin). But the chorus of critics in Berlin, including inside the government, is growing ever louder.', '“Nord Stream 2 has divided the EU, and that cannot be in Germany’s national interest,” says Norbert Röttgen, a senior member of parliament for the ruling Christian Democratic Union. “The most important role that Germany has is to bring Europe together, not to divide it. But without Germany, this division would not exist.”', 'Earlier this year, German chancellor Angela Merkel signalled a subtle but important shift in official rhetoric. Nord Stream 2, she said, was “not just an economic project”. Political factors also had to be considered, she added, not least the need to preserve Ukraine’s status as a transit country for Russian gas. Kiev earns as much as $3bn in transit fees a year, according to Naftogaz, Ukraine’s state gas company, money the embattled government badly needs. The gas link also acts as motivation for the two countries to keep their military and political conflict from spinning out of control. When the gas stops flowing — as it did, briefly, in 2006 and 2009 — both sides stand to lose.', 'After meeting his US counterpart on Monday Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president said Moscow was willing to “extend this transit contract if the dispute between [Gazprom and Naftogaz] is settled.”', 'Yet circumventing the Ukrainian network is precisely what Nord Stream is about, as Russian officials have made clear. The new pipeline will allow Russia to cut out the middleman for much of its westbound gas shipments — and to avoid the kind of disputes over payments and conditions with Kiev that have flared up in recent years. The fact that Ukraine’s pipelines are in urgent need of repair and investment provides an additional incentive.', 'For the Russian-European consortium that is bearing the cost of the project, Nord Stream 2 is, above all, a promising investment. Unlike Nord Stream 1, which was a genuine Russian-European joint venture, the new pipeline will be owned entirely by Gazprom, the Russian gas group that controls Russia’s pipeline exports. Half the financing, however, is provided by five European companies: Uniper and Wintershall of Germany, Austria’s OMV, Engie of France and Royal Dutch Shell.', 'Nord Stream’s backers are making a simple bet with potentially huge rewards. They know the pipeline will come on stream in 2019 just as supplies of European gas from the North Sea are starting to dwindle. The consortium estimates that even if overall gas demand is stable or declines slightly over the coming two decades, Europe will have to find an additional 120bn cubic metres a year of natural gas by 2035. That gap will be filled by shipping large volumes of liquefied natural gas from countries such as Qatar and the US, or through pipelines from Russia.', 'The looming gas shortfall has sparked a rush to build infrastructure, as suppliers jostle for position. Not far from Lubmin, on the other side of the Polish border, stands one of several new LNG terminals that have popped up on Europe’s coastline in recent years. Most are working well below capacity, reflecting the fact that pipeline gas is as much as 25 per cent cheaper than LNG.', 'Some German business leaders and officials suspect that this is one of the core reasons for the opposition to Nord Stream 2. The US, they say, is simply trying to boost the commercial prospects of LNG. That was the central complaint in an open letter signed by a cross-party alliance of senior German lawmakers earlier this year.', '“It is not the job of the EU to keep potential competitors off the backs of US companies that want to market their . . . natural gas in Europe,” it said. “American liquid gas is welcome on the European gas market, but it has to face the competition just like others.”', 'Why should German and European consumers and companies pay a premium for non-Russian gas? The obvious answer, say critics, is politics. Moscow, they argue, is engaged in a broad campaign to split the western alliance, destabilize European democracies and reassert Moscow’s influence in eastern Europe and the Baltics. One of the most potent weapons in that campaign is Russia’s control over energy resources — and Europe’s dependency on them. Concern over what might happen if Russia turns off the taps has weighed heavily on European minds for years. Nord Stream 2 will make those concerns even more acute.', '“Last year, Germany received slightly more than 40 percent of its gas supplies from Gazprom. If we now double the capacity by way of Nord Stream 2, we will see another significant increase in supplies from Russia,” says Mr. Röttgen. “I believe this pushes us into a danger zone, both in terms of energy policy and foreign policy. We will lose some of our independence.”', 'There is, he adds, another consideration: “The whole Putin system rests on two pillars: the military and the export of energy resources. By stabilising that second pillar, Germany is also stabilising the Putin regime.”', 'Gazprom says that given that its newer gasfields are in Russia’s north-west, Nord Stream 2 will save 2,100km of transit compared with the Ukrainian route, and cut emissions by 61 per cent.', 'Russia has also warned that US threats against it are illegal. “We believe that any sanctions against companies involved in an international project would not be legal,” Mr. Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said this month. “This is an exclusively international, commercial project devoid of any political motives, based on the principles of commercial gain for the countries that participate in it.”', 'The geopolitical case against Nord Stream 2 is made with particular intensity in eastern European capitals such as Warsaw, where fears over a Russian-German carve-up have a strong historical resonance. That sentiment was expressed in blunt terms by Radoslav Sikorski, the former Polish foreign minister, who likened the Nord Stream project to the 1939 deal between Hitler and Stalin to divide eastern Europe.', 'In Berlin, however, officials prefer to point to a different historical antecedent: the Ostpolitik of Willy Brandt, the German chancellor who pushed for rapprochement with the Soviet bloc in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In economic terms, the policy gave rise to a “gas-for-pipes” deal between West Germany and the Soviet Union. Against fierce US opposition, the Germans agreed to ship steel and pipes to the USSR, in exchange for natural gas imports.', 'The first Russian gas arrived in Germany in 1973, and imports rose steadily in the decades that followed, undisturbed by the cold war. For supporters of Nord Stream 2, that experience holds a crucial lesson. They see the gas relationship not as one of western dependence on Russia, but of mutual dependence between buyer and seller. Moscow needs western payments as much as the west needs Russian gas.', '“I see Nord Stream as a stabilising factor for the relationship between Russia and the West,” says Matthias Platzeck, a former leader of Germany’s Social Democratic party and now the president of the German-Russian Forum, a Berlin-based association designed to foster bilateral ties. “Even at the high point of the cold war the Russians always delivered their gas. Why should that change now? After all, they need the money.”', 'As the political argument continues to rage, the project itself is making steady progress. Over the past two years, the consortium has amassed vast stockpiles of concrete-coated steel tubes, and deposited them at various points on the Baltic Sea. A few weeks from now, workers will begin welding the 12-metre-long pieces together at sea and lowering them into the water. With much of the investment already made, and all but one regulatory permit for the project granted, even critics admit that it will be hard to stop it now.', 'As long as the project does not hit fresh political and technical turbulence, Gazprom is planning to open the taps at the Russian end of the 1,200km long pipeline in late 2019. The impact at the other end, however, is already being felt.', '“In commercial terms, there is a case to be made for Nord Stream 2,” says Ms. Westphal. “In political terms, however, it is clear that Germany will pay a heavy price.”', 'More from the Financial Times:', 'Ireland to become first country to divest from fossil fuels', 'EU court upholds UK Hinkley Point subsidies', 'Brussels launches investigation against Qatar Petroleum']"
131,"Are Russia and China the best of friends now? It’s complicated, analysts say",2019-09-27T06:15:38+0000,"['Russia and China appear to be increasing their economic, political and military ties amid poor relations with the West. But the relationship is far more nuanced than it first appears with strengths and weaknesses on both sides, experts note.', 'While U.S. trade relations with China have soured, as each slap billions of dollars’ worth of tariffs on each other’s goods, trade relations between China and Russia are blossoming. Chinese President Xi Jinping even called Russian President Vladimir Putin his “best friend” in an uncharacteristic display of warm relations during a state visit to Russia this summer.', 'Xi also promised Putin that China was “ready to go hand in hand with you” and the leaders signed statements committing to “the development of strategic cooperation and comprehensive partnership” between their nations and “strengthening strategic stability (which) includes international issues of mutual interest, as well as issues of global strategic stability.”', 'Strengthening economic ties is a large part of warm Sino-Russia relations. Last week, Russian and Chinese news agencies reported that the two countries want to double their trade over the next five years, to $200 billion by 2024 — up from $107 billion worth of trade in 2018 — by implementing joint projects in fields of energy, industry and agriculture.', 'Despite making vows to increase bilateral trade, the economic relationship between Russia and China is not a marriage of equals. The International Monetary Fund expects Russia’s economy to grow 1.2% in 2019; China, meanwhile, is expected to 6.3%.', 'It’s no surprise then that Russia sees China as a massive growth market at a time when its trade with western nations is sorely restricted. Russia is still subject to economic sanctions for its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, as well as interference in the 2016 U.S. election and the nerve agent poisoning of a former double agent in the U.K.', 'With that in mind, it makes sense that Russia is seeking an economic — and geopolitical — partner and ally to the East.', 'Their pledge to increase trade comes amid “a bifurcation in the U.S. and China’s spheres of influence,” Cailin Birch, global economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, told CNBC Thursday.', '“Obviously, the U.S. and China have no love lost between them and it would make much more sense for Russia to seek to build ties with this massive emerging market which will be a source of growth, in the way that the U.S. won’t be going forward, and with whom they don’t have the same political conflicts, and that presents a lot more opportunities to the Russian market for Russian energy products and developing their economic ties,” she noted.', 'For China, a partner like Russia that would “set the U.S. slightly ill at ease would be hugely beneficial,” she added.', 'Russia also has something that China needs in abundance – energy. Russia is among the world’s top three producers of oil and natural gas whereas China is the second largest crude oil importer in the world.', '“China is the main source of new energy consumption for fossil fuels particularly, and having a strong partner on its doorstep that’s ramping up its production of crude oil, the fabrication of LNG (liquefied natural gas) and the shipping of that all around the world, would also be beneficial to China,” Birch said.', 'Security and defense is another area where Russia and China have ostensibly sought to build ties and experts agree that Russia has more practical military experience than China. Just last week, China’s ‘People’s Liberation Army’ was one of seven foreign forces (including India and Pakistan) invited to join Russia’s “Tsentr 2019” massive military drills that took place across a swathe of Russia.', 'It was the second year China has participated, and its continued involvement is seen as significant by experts like Richard Weitz, senior fellow and director of the Center for Political-Military Analysis at the Hudson Institute.', '“Chinese and Russian national security communities share common objectives that can be promoted through further cooperation, such as border security, military technology development, and counterterrorism,” he told CNBC on Monday.', '“They also perceive threats from U.S. and allied positions and policies that they can cooperate to thwart, such as U.S. missile defenses and Western military intervention in regional hotspots. They conversely see opportunities to expand their influence at the expense of the United States, including by undermining U.S. bilateral and multilateral alliances.”', 'The old adage that “my enemy’s enemy is my friend” could be applied currently when it comes to China and Russia’s relationship with the U.S. right now. Sino-U.S. relations are currently more acrimonious than those between Russia and the U.S, given the lack of resolution to the trade dispute,.', 'For China, President Trump’s decision to up-end the status quo when it came to Sino-U.S. trade — because of what he has seen as unfair trade practices — and to impose billions of dollars’ worth of tariffs on Chinese imports as a result, has dented its economic growth and potential.', 'Against this backdrop, boosting Sino-Russia bilateral trade could open a door to growth for both Moscow and Beijing as lawmakers and officials confront trade barriers like sanctions and imports tariffs elsewhere.', '“There’s a growing consensus that a partnership between Russia and China is quite a powerful force, led by China rather than Russia, but that between the two of them they could represent quite a powerful bloc and I think the U.S. is growing increasingly concerned by that,” the EIU’s Birch noted.', 'She added that “Russia would be the junior partner based on size of market and its prospect for growth so obviously in that sense, Russia would be pulled into China’s sway slightly.”', 'Experts say the scales have tipped in favor of China being the dominant partner in Sino-Russian relationship and that has injected rivalry into the dynamic which is restricting cooperation on an economic and security level.', '“It looks like they’re cooperating, it looks like it’s all nice and rosy in Russia-China relations in military terms - but it’s not,” Mathieu Boulegue, research fellow of the Russia and Eurasia Programme at Chatham House, said.', 'Speaking at a briefing ahead of the military drills involving China, Boulegue said Russia’s message to China when it involved it in its war games last week was “not about cooperation.” “The message that Russia is sending to China is actually quite the opposite if you look at the deep meaning behind it.”', '“It’s about matching Chinese interests in the region because Central Asia right now is a new battleground for influence, not just on the economic side but it’s very much about the growing Chinese influence in the military and security sphere.”', 'Raffaello Pantucci, director of International Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), also said the relationship between Russia and China was mainly a “utilitarian” one and their alliance shouldn’t be overplayed by analysts.', '“What does China-Russia think, how will Russia-China react? – they do have different interests and the danger is that we over-exaggerate this strategic alliance. It’s one that has limitations and questions,” he told CNBC Monday', 'Nonetheless, the U.S. will likely be watching the Sino-Russia alliance, particularly in terms of defense, carefully especially given the recent breakdown of its own long-standing nuclear arms treaty with Russia. The Hudson Institute’s Richard Weitz noted that military ties between China and Russia have increased dramatically in recent years “and look set to deepen in key dimensions in coming years, including regional security cooperation, arms sales, military exercises, and defense dialogues.”', '“Sino-Russian security cooperation presents challenges to U.S. interests, including to the regional security balance, U.S.-led sanctions, and U.S. military freedom of action and access. These challenges would grow if China and Russia were to form a full-fledged defense alliance.”']"

The film currently has a 92 percent “Fresh” rating on Rotten Tomatoes, a good sign ahead of its opening.', 'More importantly, “Shazam” is a chance for DC to continue to build on its recent successes with “Wonder Woman” and “Aquaman.” It spins the tale of a young teenager who transforms into an adult superhero when he shouts the name “Shazam” — think “Superman” meets “Big.”', 'Trailers for “Shazam” have been bright and packed with humor, something DC’s universe has been sorely lacking. In the last six years, DC’s wave of superhero films have been dark, droll and disappointing to fans.', 'If it succeeds, it will cement the idea that audiences are more willing to open up their wallets when Warner Bros. strays from the Marvel strategy of continuity between films and embraces its more unique — and even obscure — characters.', '“They have a formula that’s working,” said Brock Bagby, executive vice president at B&B Theatres. “If they continue that, they’ll gain even more loyalty. Just like Marvel, [DC] has to be consistent if it wants to be highly successful.”', 'Warner Bros. has a long history with superhero films, particularly from DC. It distributed the original Superman flicks starring Christopher Reeve in the late ’70s and ‘80s. It also distributed a number of Batman films — from Adam West’s take in 1966 to the days of Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer and George Clooney donning the cowl in the ’80s and ’90s.', 'Although considered by some today to be campy classics, these films paved the way for the modern superhero film. As audiences became more sophisticated, so too did Warner Bros.′ comic book content. In the mid-2000s, the production company greenlighted Christopher Nolan’s gritty standalone Batman trilogy, which was well-received by critics and audiences alike and took in more than $2.46 billion at the global box office between 2005 and 2012.', 'It did not quite see the same success with its reboot of Superman in 2006. “Superman Returns” earned only $391 million worldwide and was so widely panned that Warner Bros. scrapped any possibility of a sequel.', 'The success of Nolan’s Dark Knight Trilogy inspired a darker retelling of Superman’s origin in the form of 2013′s “Man of Steel” from director Zach Snyder. While the film was ripped apart by critics for turning the optimistic superhuman boy scout into a brooding antihero, it made nearly $700 million globally, guaranteeing a second installment.', 'By the time “Man of Steel” hit theaters, however, Marvel Studios had already cranked out six films. This included the blockbuster “Avengers” flick, which grossed a whopping $1.5 billion at the global box office, according to Comscore data.', '“This was years in the making,” Paul Dergarabedian, senior analyst at Comscore, said. “Marvel was not an overnight success. Marvel had these building blocks where they literally created something that audiences were intrigued by and then got hooked on and had to follow.”', 'Marvel had spent the years between 2008 and 2012 laying the groundwork for a massive team-up film. It took a chance on the then-uninsurable Robert Downey Jr. to take on the role of Iron Man, aka billionaire Tony Stark, a B-side Marvel hero so low in status that most non-comic book fans associated “Iron Man” with a Black Sabbath song of the same name.', 'Over the course of four years, Marvel introduced audiences to the Hulk, Thor and Captain America in standalone features that incorporated several secondary characters such as Black Widow and Nick Fury. The films were praised for how they weaved together humor and drama.', 'Marvel, which was acquired by Disney in 2009, proved that audiences were not only hungry for superhero films, but would show up in droves to see their favorite characters work together to defeat a common enemy.', '“Kevin Feige has been the mastermind. Even though they’ve had a bunch of writers and directors, they still had one guy overseeing the whole thing,” Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice, said of Marvel.', 'In a rush to keep up with the rampant success of Marvel, Warner Bros. used Superman’s sequel film to introduce Ben Affleck as an older Batman and Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, two key members of the Justice League. The goal was to quickly establish these characters so that the production company could release a “Justice League” film.', '“Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice” was the team-up movie that comic book lovers had longed to see for decades. The caped crusader from Gotham and the Man of Steel had never appeared in a live-action adaptation together before this film’s release in 2016. Fans raced to theaters opening weekend, shelling out $420 million worldwide during its debut to see the spectacle. However, reviews were sour, and ticket sales during the film’s second weekend shrunk 70 percent.', '“If you chase what another entity is doing, that doesn’t really work,” Dergarabedian said.', 'He noted that it was the brand-name characters — Superman and Batman — that drove a lot of the ticket demand. The film itself was not quite as beloved as its comic book stars. The film ultimately grossed $873 million worldwide, according to Comscore data.', '“Marvel has always understood that it is first and foremost about characters,” said Alisha Grauso, editorial lead at ticketing site Atom Tickets. “We are in an age now where we are very character-driven, and the fact that DC veered away from the fundamental core of its characters, I don’t think that worked.”', 'Warner Bros.′ “Suicide Squad” brought together a team of famous and infamous DC comic book super villains who were more endearing than their hero counterparts. However, a shoddy story arc and thin character development earned it a 27 percent Rotten Tomatoes score. Still, the film earned $746 million globally.', '“Wonder Woman” was a breath of fresh air for the franchise in 2017. The film, lighter in aesthetic and tone, resonated well with moviegoers. Idealistic Diana, an Amazon from the mythical Themyscira, was charming, and fans were eager to root for her. The first female-centric superhero film on the big screen was directed by Patty Jenkins and hauled in $821 million.', '″[Wonder Woman] is a really beloved character,” Grauso said. “Warner Bros. got the character right with Diana’s compassion and her strength ... it was the first movie that they really took the time to craft the character.”', 'However, the praise for Warner Bros. would fade before the end of the year. “Justice League” hit theaters less than six months after “Wonder Woman,” and the reception was lackluster, to say the least. Murky visuals, weak storytelling and poor chemistry between the major characters earned the film a 40 percent Rotten Tomatoes score.', 'The film earned $657 million at the global box office, less than half of 2012′s “Avengers” haul.', 'The dark tones and palate that worked for Batman don’t work for a bigger universe, said Jonathan Gray, professor of English and popular culture at John Jay College and CUNY Graduate Center. Warner Bros.′ biggest misstep came from trying to shoehorn lighter, more optimistic characters such as Flash, Superman and Wonder Woman into that gritty setting.', '“That’s where they went wrong,” he said. “You look at Superman, who is tonally the opposite of Batman. He’s hopeful where Batman is pessimistic. He’s light where Batman is dark. But when you look at the Zach Snyder Superman movies, they are Batman movies. They are dark and pessimistic, and that for me was the problem.”', 'From 2013 to 2017, the DC Extended Universe films made $3.7 billion, a huge feat for Warner Bros. However, none of its films had grossed more than $1 billion until “Aquaman.” While some called the film and its CGI “cheesy,” for the most part, it was well-received for Jason Momoa’s charisma and its action-packed but playful script.', 'Currently, there is no official word on whether a “Justice League” sequel will be coming to theaters, but if one is on the docket it probably won’t show up anytime soon. Henry Cavill will no longer don the cape as Superman, and Affleck has hung up his cowl.', 'Ezra Miller, who played the Flash in “Justice League,” made a bid in March to pen the script for a Flash film to ensure that he could stay on as the speedy Barry Allen in his own feature film.', 'And it is unclear if Cyborg, another hero from “Justice League,” will find his way to the big screen.', '“There is some fatigue on Batman and Superman, but there’s such a deep vault of superheroes and villains that have been untapped with DC,” Bagby said. “There’s tons of potential.”', 'Looking at Warner Bros.′ slate, one thing is clear: It’s course correcting.', '“DC has had a different style, a different tone, following the Dark Knight Trilogy,” Dergarabedian said. “Now it’s about learning from what fans liked or didn’t like from previous films. I think they really have a handle on what they need to do.”', 'After “Shazam,” there will be the much-anticipated standalone “Joker” film, starring Joaquin Phoenix, in October. The film deviates from the comics by focusing on Arthur Fleck, a failed stand-up comedian who is driven insane and, thus, turns to a life of crime in 1981 Gotham City. The film is expected to be dark and psychological, just like the Clown Prince of Crime himself.', 'Joker Tweet', '“Warner Bros. is realizing they don’t necessarily need the Justice League right now because individual characters and stories not tied to a massive interwoven cinematic universe can still do well at the box office and with moviegoers,” said Erik Davis, managing editor at Fandango.', '“By focusing more on character than building out a universe, Warner Bros. isn’t beholden to a larger story — instead, the studio can focus on telling one great story one film at a time, and then develop additional stories depending on what fans want to see more of,” he said.', 'Margot Robbie’s take on Harley Quinn in “Suicide Squad” was so well-received by fans that she’s slated to reprise the role in three more feature films due out over the next few years. She’ll be seen alongside a rogues’ gallery of characters from the DC universe in “Birds of Prey,” “Suicide Squad 2” and “Gotham City Sirens.”', 'In 2020, fans will get a new Wonder Woman film. Although Jenkins returns to direct, it won’t be a sequel. “Wonder Woman 1984” will link back to 2017′s “Wonder Woman” in some fashion, showing what Diana has been up to in the 40 years since we last saw her, but it’s a standalone film.', 'In the works is also a standalone Batman film directed by Matt Reeves, an “Aquaman” sequel and an “Aquaman” spinoff film called “The Trench.”', '“The biggest indicator that Warner Bros. is turning the ship around is the critical reviews and fan reaction,” Grauso said. “For Warner Bros. money is always important, but more than anything, it’s about rebuilding trust in the brand.”', 'Disclosure: Comcast, the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC, owns Fandango and Rotten Tomatoes.']"

There’s dark mode, for example, which you can turn on or off (or schedule to turn on automatically at night), that’s easier on your eyes at night. It also just looks cooler than the bright theme you might be used to.', 'My favorite feature is the new Photos app. It really brings a lot of your camera roll of pictures to life. Live photos and videos animate in a new “Days” tab, for example, but you can also now easily sort by month or year to quickly find life highlights. Videos or panoramas, or subjects Apple thinks are important, will pop up as larger thumbnails (as you can see in the picture below.) And speaking of photos, Portrait pictures, the ones that let you blur the background to make it look like it was taken by a professional photographer, now let you adjust the amount of blur in the background, which is perfect if you think Apple’s software overdid it.', 'In tandem with the launch of Apple Arcade, the company’s $5/month premium game service that gives you unlimited access to a large library of exclusive games, iOS 13 also supports Bluetooth Xbox One and PS4 controllers. I tested this and loved using it, particularly to stream games from my PlayStation 4. But here I am just playing a game from the App Store on my iPhone with an Xbox One controller:', 'Another new feature that’s included, but which I haven’t tried yet, is called “Sign in with Apple.” This will let you automatically sign in to apps using your Apple ID. It’s sort of like the option you might already see for signing in with your Facebook or Google account, but Sign in with Apple lets you give the app a random email address so that developers don’t have your real one if you don’t want them to.', 'Speaking of security, Apple will also warn you when an app is using your location or Bluetooth, how often it’s doing so, and if you want to continue granting that app access. Companies like Facebook are already fighting back.', 'Apple Maps has also been totally redesigned, but that redesign hasn’t been completed for the entire U.S. and will roll out over time. You’ll see new features like “Collections” that let you store your favorite places, a new feature called “Look Around” that’s like Google’s Street View (though this isn’t everywhere yet, either), real time public transit schedules, flight status information and a new CarPlay interface that looks less cluttered than earlier versions of CarPlay and is easier to navigate.', 'There’s a lot more in iOS 13, like the ability to let Siri read text messages to your AirPods, new Memoji, a built-in swipe keyboard and more.

That’s a figure the billionaire said the Heritage  Foundation indicated was the minimum number needed to comfortably  “deal with major contingencies.”', '  “The funding increases would pay for soldiers and not equipment,  and would therefore be of minor benefit to hardware  manufacturers,” said Credit Suisse analyst Robert Spingarn.', '  Still, the analyst believes there’s some upside for larger  munitions firms such as General Dynamics and Orbital ATK, as well  as for missile companies such as Lockheed, Raytheon and Boeing.', '  Trump also pledged in his Philadelphia address that he would  “seek to develop a state-of-the-art missile defense system” and  modernize the Navy’s cruisers with ballistic missile defense  capability.

But when it comes to one of society’s biggest challenges, dealing with climate change, the online giant has not been seen as a corporate leader. That is beginning to change.', 'Amazon recently announced its Shipment Zero goal, under which the company aims to have 50 percent of all deliveries reach net zero carbon emissions by 2030. Amazon also is finally tracking its carbon footprint and for the first time will release a carbon report this year. It’s a type of climate change disclosure that has become more common among major corporations but which the Jeff Bezos-led company has long resisted.', '“Amazon has not been a leader when it comes to disclosing its carbon footprint,” said Sue Reid, vice president of climate and energy for Ceres, a nonprofit that advocates investors and companies to tackle sustainability issues like climate change.', 'True to form, Amazon is going its own way with the climate report. Rather than releasing its findings to the CDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project — an organization that collects data from major companies every year and compiles it into what the nonprofit claims to be the most comprehensive collection of self-reported environmental information — Amazon is developing its own approach to tracking and reporting carbon emissions.', 'Amazon would not disclose how it plans to achieve net zero status or report its carbon emissions beyond its blog post.', 'Reid is willing to give Amazon the benefit of the doubt. “The disclosure element, the commitment of the company to disclose later this year what it says has taken a couple of years’ worth of data to get its arms around, is a huge piece of the equation of what investors are looking for to show that companies are taking climate change seriously.”', 'So are other investors, who have been pressuring corporations for years.', 'Tim Smith, director of environmental, social and governance shareowner engagement at Walden Asset Management, said CDP is an important tool that investors use, but it isn’t the only part of the litmus test. “The most important is huge companies, whether Walmart or Amazon, saying they are committed to moving in this direction. ... When one of the largest companies is saying the issue is real and human activity causes it and here is what we will do, it is exceedingly important and they deserve credit,” Smith said.', 'Reid said Ceres will be keeping a close eye on Amazon’s in-house methodology for calculating greenhouse gas emissions and how comparable it is to organizations like the CDP. “It’s really important it be transparent with how they’ve done their math and comparable to other disclosures so investors can look at how Amazon compares to the other companies in their portfolio,” she said.', 'Other experts are concerned Amazon’s self-reported carbon emission report won’t measure up.', '“If you are doing such a fantastic job, you would join something like the CDP, which is a verified, structured system that allows us to understand what you’re doing and to benchmark your performance against your peers,” said Aseem Prakash, director of the Center for Environmental Politics at the University of Washington.', 'Last year slightly over 7,000 companies disclosed their carbon footprints with the CDP.

Since 2010 the only grade from the CDP that Amazon has received is an F — for non-participation.', 'Prakash said Amazon has yet to disclose its carbon footprint because there has been a lack of pressure, from both customers and investors, for the company to do so. “The single most important issue is return on investment,” Prakash said. That is changing as Amazon faces pressure not just from investors but its own employees.', 'Last year, 16 Amazon employees who owned stock in the company filed a shareholder resolution requesting Amazon’s Board of Directors prepare a public report describing how the company is planning for disruptions posed by climate change, and how they plan to reduce the company’s fossil fuel dependence. The resolution was pointed: “Amazon is both affected by and contributing to climate change,” the report stated.', '“I think we have to add pressure, we have to encourage them, and it can be positive,” Prakash said of Amazon’s recent steps in the right direction. “You have to have a situation where no deed goes unpunished, good or bad.”', 'Reporting carbon emissions is a good first step, but proactively changing a business to be carbon-neutral is a far larger challenge.', 'Amazon has invested in a massive wind farm in Texas, solar farms in four other states, and launched a frustration-free packaging program last year aimed at eliminating waste through the supply chain.

DHL is expanding its fleet of electric vehicle delivery vans, which will use electricity or natural gas and clean diesel as an effort to reach its long-term goal of reducing logistics-related emissions to net zero by 2050.', 'To be totally net zero carbon, or carbon neutral, means a company would remove or reduce the same amount of greenhouse gas it is estimated to produce. The Amazon Shipment Zero goal of making 50 percent of its shipments to customers net-zero carbon by 2030 is possible because of improvements in electric vehicles, aviation biofuels, reusable packaging, and renewable energy, the company said in a blog post making the announcement. It declined to provide further comment.', 'Greene said it’s unclear if delivery to customers is the only part of their operations and supply chain that will be included in the reduction target. Amazon already uses hydrogen-fuel forklifts in warehouses and when it comes to small vehicles and vans, Greene agrees the industry has seen improvements delivering packages to customers. It’s the long-distance portion of the supply chain, which uses big semi-trucks running on diesel rather than electric or other cleaner solutions, that still needs improving.', 'Amazon recently led a $700 million investment round in the electric truck start-up Rivian as the company looks to change its delivery methods, and some industry experts have speculated that Amazon could use Rivian’s trucks for its global logistics needs.', '“Green technologies do exist, but even when they are ready to go, think about how long it will take to adopt these solutions at a greater scale,” Greene said. “There are millions and millions of trucks on the planet, and electric vehicles and trucks are going to be crazy expensive, plus there’s the question of where you charge them. Long-distance transport is far from ready.”', 'A prevalent method companies undertake toward reducing carbon emissions is through carbon offsetting, which requires calculating a company’s greenhouse gas emissions and spending money elsewhere to reduce them, such as methane captures from landfills, tree planting, and investing in solar and wind farms.', 'Greene argues there are currently no carbon offsetting projects that are specifically related to reducing emissions in the transportation sector, and it’s even more important that the methodology Amazon uses to calculate that figure aligns with others in their industry. Since Amazon subcontracts companies like UPS, FedEx and DHL to deliver its packages, transparency on carbon emissions down the supply chain is critical, Greene said.', 'Initiatives like the Global Logistics Emissions Council Framework and the Science-Based Targets initiative are two sources helping companies develop common reporting methods, Greene added.', 'Americans’ belief in climate change has been rising, with 71 percent of Americans saying that global warming is happening, and 50 percent saying they will be personally harmed by the effects of global warming, according to the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.', 'Reid said Amazon’s commitment to disclose its carbon footprint is a huge piece of the equation for investors with whom Ceres works on factoring climate change into the valuation of a company.', 'Ceres is also a founding partner organization of Climate Action 100+, which is an investor initiative started in 2017 to hold some of the largest greenhouse gas emitting companies accountable by improving governance, curbing emissions and strengthening climate-related financial disclosures. The initiative is comprised of more than 320 investors who hold $33 trillion in assets under management, and 100 of the largest corporate emitters they target account for two-thirds of annual global industrial emissions. Walden Asset Management also is a member.', '“The elements related to customers and employees are really key here,” Reid said. “Investors are super attuned to the reputational element of climate leadership. That builds value, it builds loyalty with employees who want to see their company take climate change seriously.”', 'Walden’s Smith said that Amazon has historically been “more insular” than other companies and taken a position that they seem to think they “don’t need to talk to investors” but they face as many if not more shareholder resolutions than any other company this year and they are responding. “They’ve made the commitment to measure it and manage it, and I am quite confident,” but he added, “The challenge for them will be how to do it.”', 'Google may have the same issue as Amazon when it comes to increasing build-outs of data centers that are energy hogs, but investing in wind and solar farms to power these operations is easier than figuring out a carbon solution for a global logistics operation.', '“They don’t want to make pledge they can’t honor,” Smith said. “For investors, while disclosure is very important, disclosure requests have become much more pointed and specific. Investors are much more likely to be asking for the specific steps to change rather than just disclosing [a carbon footprint]. If [Amazon] is moving on the issue and really being proactive, they really need to not only be actively looking at the data themselves but asking, ‘what are we going to do and what are our public goals?’”', 'WATCH:\ufeff Jeff Bezos is so much bigger than Amazon — a look at his extraordinary empire']"

Further analysis in the coming months will be required to better determine the resource potential.', '“These are encouraging results in a frontier exploration area,” said Steve Greenlee, president of Exxon Mobil Exploration Co. “The potential for this newly discovered resource to serve as an energy source for regional and global markets will be evaluated further.”', 'Glaucus-1 was the second of a two-well drilling program in Block 10.

The first well, Delphyne-1, did not encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbons.', 'Block 10 is 635,554 acres (2,572 square kilometers).

The reality is that it may trigger more disputes,” Euthymius Petrou, former advisor to the Greek Ministry of Defense and expert on Turkish affairs told CNBC.', 'So far no international energy company has expressed interest in investing and supporting the EastMed gas pipeline project.

Cadillac outsold Lincoln by more than three-to-one in China last year, selling a total of 175,489 vehicles though a network of roughly 180 retail stores.', 'China is Cadillac’s largest market.', 'If Beijing follows through on its threat to double import tariffs before Lincoln can ramp up local production, the resulting price hikes on its imported models could persuade many people to buy a Cadillac or a Lexus instead, said CADCC’s Zhu.']"
