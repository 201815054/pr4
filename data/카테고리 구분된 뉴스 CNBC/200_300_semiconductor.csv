Earlier this year, Lenskart raised $95 million from global investment firm KKR. It also counts SoftBank as one of its investors.', '“I think we would do an IPO in the next 24 to 36 months latest,” Bansal told CNBC’s “Street Signs Asia.”', '“We still want to achieve a little bit more scale and grow our business in India as well as Southeast Asia. Then, we’ll be ready to do IPO,” he said, adding that the plan is to grow revenue to more than $500 million.', 'Lenskart expanded into Singapore in 2019. Bansal said Friday that he is confident the start-up can become the top player in the city-state over the next 12 to 18 months.', 'The company, which is reportedly valued at $2.5 billion, plans to use the newly raised funds to expand its presence in India and grow its operations in Southeast Asia and the Middle East in the next three to four years.', 'Some of the capital would also be deployed as investments into artificial intelligence and other technologies.', '“There’s a huge demand for high-quality, affordable eyewear,” Bansal said about the Indian market. He claimed consumers buy on average four pairs of eyewear from Lenskart every two years, compared to a pair of eyewear every two-and-a-half years from other companies.', 'The biggest hurdle for Lenskart is creating a supply chain, according to Bansal. He explained that the company is in the process of building a manufacturing plant in India from which, it plans to ship about 150,000 prescription glasses a day.', '“A lot of this capital actually goes in long-term investment in technology and building the supply chain infrastructure,” he said.', 'Indian start-ups are entering what some investors have described as the “beginning of a new era,” where the prominent names are going public. Food delivery firm Zomato made its stock market debut on Friday, and its shares jumped over 70% at the open.']"
1,"Amazon will overtake Walmart as the largest U.S. retailer in 2022, JPMorgan predicts",2021-06-11T14:47:57+0000,"['Amazon is on track to overtake Walmart as the largest U.S. retailer in 2022, according to JPMorgan research released Friday.', 'Amazon’s U.S. retail business is the “fastest growing at scale,” according to the company’s analysts. Between 2014 and 2020, Amazon’s U.S. gross merchandise volume, or GMV — a closely watched industry metric used to measure the total value of goods sold over a certain time period — has grown “significantly faster” than both U.S. adjusted retail sales and U.S. e-commerce, the analysts said.', 'Neither Amazon nor Walmart break out GMV in their quarterly earnings results, but JPMorgan estimates Amazon’s GMV is growing faster than its largest retail competitor. JPMorgan analysts said Amazon’s GMV in 2020 climbed 41% year over year to $316 billion, while Walmart’s GMV is estimated to have grown 10% year over year to $439 billion in 2020.', '“Based on current estimates, we believe Amazon could surpass Walmart to become the largest U.S. retailer in 2022,” J.P. Morgan analysts Christopher Horvers and Doug Anmuth wrote Friday.', 'Horvers and Anmuth highlighted a few factors they believe are driving Amazon’s top-line growth, including an expansion into “large and under-penetrated categories” such as grocery and apparel, strong growth of third-party seller sales and the “Prime flywheel.” Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in April the company now has more than 200 million Prime subscribers, up from 150 million at the beginning of 2020.', 'The coronavirus pandemic rapidly accelerated the adoption of e-commerce and cemented Amazon’s dominance in the retail space. Stuck-at-home consumers turned to Amazon for a plethora of goods ranging from toilet paper to workout gear. They also relied on Amazon for services they might not have otherwise considered, such as online grocery delivery.', 'Amazon’s pandemic-fueled sales surge has helped it grow its slice of the e-commerce market. JPMorgan estimates Amazon expanded its share of the U.S. e-commerce market to 39% in 2020, up from 24% in 2014.', 'The accelerated adoption of e-commerce has also provided a lift to other areas of Amazon’s business.', 'Amazon is on track to “become one of the largest delivery companies” in the U.S., analysts at Bank of America wrote in research published Tuesday.', 'Amazon is estimated to deliver 7 billion packages in 2021, surpassing the roughly 6 billion packages UPS is expected to deliver in the U.S. this year, the analysts wrote, citing figures from MWPVL International, a supply chain and logistics consulting firm.', 'In recent years, Amazon has quietly built a shipping operation that rivals the likes of UPS, FedEx and the U.S. Postal Service. It maintains an ever-increasing network of warehouses and last-mile delivery stations, and a sprawling logistics operation with airplanes, trucks and vans.', 'This has allowed Amazon to deliver most of its own orders. Amazon currently delivers packages for other businesses in the U.K. and could one day expand that service to the U.S.', 'MWPVL estimates Amazon handled about 5 billion of the 7.35 billion packages it shipped in 2020. UPS and USPS handled the other 1.25 billion and 1.1 billion, respectively, according to Bank of America analysts.']"

So those conversations are ongoing and hopefully we’ll have more to say about that soon,” she said.', 'The Ever Given, one of the world’s largest shipping vessels, has blocked all traffic along the critical trade route since running aground more than three days earlier.', 'At about 400 meters in length, the ship is nearly as long as the Empire State Building is high.', 'Some fear it could take weeks to clear the canal, which handles around 12% of global trade. That prospect is starting to impact the economy and disrupt international supply chains.', '“We do see some potential impacts on energy markets from the role of the Suez Canal as a key bidirectional transit route for oil, and obviously that’s one of the reasons we offered assistance from the United States,” Psaki said Friday.', '“We are in close consultation with the Egyptians about that,” she said, adding, “We’re going to continue to monitor market conditions and we will respond appropriately if necessary, but it is something we’re watching closely.”']"
3,"Relativity Space unveils a reusable, 3D-printed rocket to compete with SpaceX’s Falcon 9",2021-02-25T20:05:27+0000,"['Relativity Space, the 3D-printing rocket builder, is making another big bet: Developing a fully reusable rocket, designed to match the power and capability of SpaceX’s workhorse Falcon 9 rockets.', 'Called Terran R, the reusable rocket is “really an obvious evolution” from the company’s Terran 1 rocket, Relativity CEO Tim Ellis told CNBC – the latter of which Relativity expects to launch for the first time later in 2021.', '“It’s the same architecture, the same propellant, the same factory, the same 3D printers, the same avionics and the same team,” Ellis said.', '“I’ve always been a huge fan of reusability. No matter how you look at it – even with 3D printing, and dropping the cost, and [increasing the] automation of a launch vehicle – making it reusable has got to be part of that future,” Ellis added.', 'Terran R is the first of several new initiatives that Ellis expects Relativity to unveil in the year ahead, with the company having raised more than $680 million since its founding five years ago. Just like Terran 1, Relativity will build Terran R with more than 90% of the parts through additive manufacturing – utilizing the world’s largest 3D printers as what Ellis calls “the factory of the future.”', 'Relativity, valued at $2.3 billion, ranks as one of the most valuable private space companies in the world. Its investors include Tiger Global Management, Fidelity, Baillie Gifford, Mark Cuban and more.', 'Ellis emphasized that – even with Terran R’s announcement – Relativity is “very focused on getting Terran 1 to first launch,” which he said is still on track to happen later this year.', 'And the company plans to keep Terran 1 long term as Ellis believes “it’s a great product.”', '“We’re not pulling a ‘Falcon 1 to Falcon 9’ change,” Ellis said, noting how Elon Musk’s SpaceX originally was building and planning to operate a smaller rocket.', 'Terran R represents an expansion of Relativity’s offerings in the launch marketplace.', 'Terran 1 is priced at $12 million per launch and is designed to carry 1,250 kilograms to low Earth orbit. That puts Terran 1 in the middle of the U.S. launch market, in between Rocket Lab’s Electron and SpaceX’s Falcon 9 in both price and capability.', 'Ellis said Terran R will be capable of lifting nearly 20 times as much payload as Terran 1, with Relativity targeting a rocket capable of launching more than 20,000 kilograms to low Earth orbit. That would be near the 22,800 kilograms that SpaceX says its Falcon 9 rockets can launch.', 'While Ellis declined to disclose what price per launch Relativity expects for Terran R, he said that Relativity plans to be competitive with other offerings. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches with a $62 million price tag, with Musk’s company saying each rocket costs about $28 million to launch.', '“We really were asked by the market to create [Terran R] and we’re currently talking with customers,” Ellis said.', 'Relativity has a pipeline worth several billion dollars of contracts “in active dialogue” for both its Terran 1 and Terran R rockets, Ellis said, with customer interest split evenly between the two vehicles. He noted that the Terran 1 contracts that Relativity has announced to date have binding launch service agreements, so customers are paying on deposits for the rockets.', '“There are tons of customers, all getting funding and developing big plans, and that’s really driving the need for more launch capacity globally,” Ellis said.', 'Not only does Relativity’s CEO expect to be competitive in the marketplace, but he also believes there will be more spacecraft trying to launch than there are rides to orbit.', '“There’s actually going to be a launch shortage, if you look at how many people are trying to launch payloads to space,” Ellis said. “Almost every model we’ve looked at, there need to be more launch vehicles to deploy even a fraction of the plans that people are talking about.”', 'Ellis also touted Terran R’s reusability as further enhancing Relativity’s competitiveness.', '“I just don’t see a future where a fully reusable rocket doesn’t exist and doesn’t need to exist,” Ellis said.', 'He highlighted SpaceX’s work on reusability as informing Relativity’s approach to Terran R, which he expects will be “fully reusable.” SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rockets are partially reusable, in that the company lands the first stage (also known as the booster) and often recovers the rocket’s nosecone. But SpaceX does not recover Falcon 9′s second stages – a feat Relativity aims to pull off by 3D printing designs which “wouldn’t be possible with traditional manufacturing,” Ellis said.', '“We will be able to print far more exotic and traditionally difficult-to-manufacture materials that make both first- and second-stage reusability much better,” Ellis said.', 'Relativity’s focus on 3D printing means the company doesn’t have to change or add new equipment to its production line.', '“The printers, straight up with software changes, will build Terran R,” Ellis said.', '“It’s a completely different technology stack for aerospace,” Ellis added. “Every aerospace factory you walk into today is still building products with giant fixed tooling and a very complex supply chain and it takes many years to develop a new product. If you want to do slight tweaks and changes, you’ve got to rip out all of that and go all over again.”', 'Relativity has been building Terran 1 with the expectation that Terran R was coming. ', 'Ellis noted that Terran 1 is fueled by liquid oxygen and liquid methane – propellants are the focal point of next-generation reusable rockets. Even the company’s testing facilities at NASA’s Stennis Space Center in Mississippi “are already sized” to test the larger engines needed for Terran R, he said.', '“Many of the pieces are quite similar architecturally, but the thing that’s wildly different is the fact that [Terran R] is fully reusable,” Ellis said.', 'Relativity has completed hundreds of tests on its Aeon 1 engines that will power Terran 1 – but Terran R will feature a “new engine called Aeon R” that the company has begun developing, Ellis said.', '“We’ve also tested the engine for the upper stage,” Ellis said. “It’s a copper chamber engine ... and it’s actually now the same engine on the upper stage of Terran R as on Terran 1.”', 'The company expects to conduct “mission duty cycle tests,” also known as a full duration test, of the new more powerful engine in the coming days, Ellis said.', 'Relativity plans to launch Terran R from Cape Canaveral in Florida, where the company previously secured a launch site for Terran 1.', 'Although Ellis declined to talk specifically about his expectations for Terran R’s development timeline, he said the company is announcing it now because it’s begun building hardware and conducting tests.', '“I think there was only a matter of time that we were going to be able to keep it secret,” Ellis said, noting that Relativity is “now out in the market and selling” Terran R launches.', 'The company will reveal more details on the design and specifications of Terran R later this year. As for how Relativity plans to land its Terran R rockets, Ellis said his company will utilize “maybe both” concrete landing pads and drone ships, as SpaceX does.', 'Overall, Ellis has a vision of 3D-printed reusable rockets as “the inevitable technology we need to build humanity’s industrial base on Mars” – a goal similar to Musk’s dream to “make humanity a multiplanetary species” by establishing settlements on the red planet. Ellis believes Relativity and SpaceX can be two companies leading a new era of exploration.', '“We need to inspire dozens to hundreds of companies to do this,” he said.', 'Subscribe to CNBC PRO for exclusive insights and analysis, and live business day programming from around the world.']"

', 'Normally, it would take a day for the shipment to get checked into the facility, but this time, it took three weeks, said Williams, whose Maryland-based business, Flashback Limited, sells video game accessories. Growing frustrated, he got in touch with a Post Office supervisor, who told him the packages were accidentally left behind on a semi truck in the Detroit facility. Shortly after, the items were shipped out. ', 'Williams attributes the mishap to ongoing delays created by the pandemic, which have hampered the USPS and other carriers. “Every once in a while something gets missed, but that’s the first time that happened to me to that degree,” he added. ', 'The incident is an example of what could become a recurring headache for small and big online businesses if problems with the U.S. Postal Service persist. ', 'The Postal Service faces a tough road ahead. Its financial woes were exacerbated by the pandemic, and critical funding is tied up in the latest coronavirus relief package, which President Donald Trump has rejected as part of his fight against mail-in voting. The USPS also faces operational challenges after recently installed Postmaster General Louis DeJoy limited overtime and prohibited workers from making late delivery trips. On Tuesday, Reuters reported that DeJoy would pause the roll out of those initiatives until after the November presidential election.', 'The changes instituted by DeJoy, in addition to the coronavirus pandemic, have coincided with reports of widespread mail delays like those experienced by Williams. Still, the Postal Service is largely operating without delays for many Americans nationwide.', 'In June, USPS delivered 93.7% of first-class mail packages on time, according to ShipMatrix, a software provider that analyzes shipping data. That’s in line with or better than UPS or FedEx, which reported on-time delivery rates of 94% and 91.5%, respectively, during the same period. However, it’s still down from May, when the USPS delivered 94.9% of packages on time.', '“Even at 93.7%, that 6.3% can be hundreds of thousands of packages,” said Satish Jindel, founder of ShipMatrix. “It’s not a great number, but they’re moving tens of millions of packages per day, and you’re not going to hear about the good cases.”', 'The USPS is relied upon not only by small businesses who sell goods via their own websites, but also sprawling online marketplaces operated by Amazon, EBay, Etsy, as well as major retailers like Walmart and Target. Growth in package shipping from online retailers like Amazon has consistently been a bright spot in the Post Office’s financial results, amid declines in shipments of letters and magazines.', 'Amazon has built up a vast logistics and fulfillment operation across the country, but it still relies on the Postal Service to handle some last-mile deliveries when it’s not using its own contractors. An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment on what percentage of its packages are delivered by USPS, but some analysts estimate the Postal Service delivers 40% of Amazon’s orders. ', 'UPS, DHL and FedEx also rely on the Postal Service to handle a portion of their last-mile deliveries via the same Parcel Select service used by Amazon. The service allows carriers and companies like Amazon to handle the long distance portion of the delivery process, then drop packages off at local Post Offices, where employees handle last-mile deliveries within a certain radius. ', '“In cases where it’s not actually profitable for Amazon, UPS, FedEx or DHL to make the delivery, they actually rely on USPS,” said Mario Paganini, head of marketing at Shippo, which provides software to connect businesses with shipping services. “It’s much more cost effective to bring a large volume of halfway or all the way across the country and then have the USPS do the last-mile delivery.”', 'For small business owners, the USPS is often the most affordable and reliable shipping option available. Roughly 89% of the small- and medium-sized businesses that use Shippo select the USPS as their primary carrier, Paganini said. Shippo doesn’t disclose how many SMBs use its services, but they make up the majority of the services’ 50,000-plus active customers.', '″[The USPS] is a pretty key enabler of small business,” Paganini said. “This is something that a lot of people overlook and take for granted.”', 'John Von Colln, founder of on-demand poster printing company Shortrunposters.com, said the Postal Service typically charges about $5 per order for first-class mail, while UPS’s shipping rates can cost more than double that price. ', 'Von Colln said it’s important that his company offer affordable shipping costs for cheap, lightweight items like posters to keep customers happy. “People don’t want to pay more for shipping than the product itself,” Von Colln added. ', 'Delivery delays aren’t the only concern weighing on business owners’ minds. They also worry about the possibility that the Postal Service will be pressured to raise shipping prices as a way to shore up its finances.', 'President Trump has repeatedly called for the Postal Service to quadruple its package delivery services, claiming the Postal Service has charged online retailers too little to deliver packages. Trump has long held, without evidence, that Amazon is being subsidized by the Postal Service, once saying that Amazon uses the USPS as its “delivery boy.”', 'The Postal Service on Friday announced it would raise the price of commercial shipments during the peak holiday shopping period, but the rate increase is temporary, ending Dec. 27. UPS and FedEx have since announced similar price hikes. ', 'John Webber, founder of Carved, which designs and manufactures wooden smartphone cases, said that if the USPS raises prices, it would not only hurt his business’ bottom line, but it would most likely mean he’d pass the cost onto consumers. He estimates that the Postal Service manages more than 90% of his company’s domestic package volume. ', 'The Postal Service’s affordable prices have become even more critical during the pandemic and the broader economic downturn, which has forced many businesses to look for ways to cut costs.', 'What’s more, if the USPS aggressively hiked its shipping prices like Trump has suggested, some businesses might turn to competing carriers like UPS and FedEx, causing it to lose market share.', 'Calls to keep Postal Service prices affordable have garnered support from a growing number of e-commerce companies and retailers. The Package Coalition, a lobbying group backed by Amazon and eBay, among others, has urged lawmakers to keep the service “affordable and reliable.”', 'In May, the retail coalition launched a series of television ads in a number of states opposing efforts to impose rate hikes on the Postal Service. The group also continues to lobby the Senate to provide emergency relief for the Post Service, fearing it will run out of cash in the “not too distant future,” said John McHugh, chairman of the Package Coalition.', '“This is not a ‘maybe it’ll happen,’ it’s ‘when will [it] happen,’” McHugh said. “We’ve really been going full boar in attempting to help lawmakers and their key staff.” ', 'Etsy and EBay have advocated directly for the need for additional USPS funding on behalf of the business owners that make up their marketplaces. ', 'Late last month, Etsy CEO Josh Silverman wrote to Congress, urging lawmakers to provide emergency funding for the Postal Service and expand coronavirus relief for small businesses. ', '“The vast majority of U.S. Etsy sellers — 91% — rely on USPS to deliver their packages to consumers,” Silverman wrote. “USPS is particularly important for our sellers who live in rural communities, where USPS may be the only carrier available to them.”', 'EBay’s public policy team has also urged Congress to support a “strong and viable” Postal Service. EBay sellers also meet with lawmakers in Washington, D.C. each year to discuss issues impacting their business. Williams, who is a part of eBay’s small business ambassador network, attended last year’s meeting and said the Postal Service was one of several issues discussed.', '“We talked to them about insuring that the USPS remains a public service and ensuring that it can provide service to rural areas at affordable rates,” Williams said, adding that eBay remains actively engaged in these issues with lawmakers.']"

I called the manufacturer, and a very nice customer-service representative mailed me instructions for replacing the switch at home, along with five new switches.', 'To gain the necessary soldering experience, I ripped apart an old alarm clock and practiced removing and re-soldering some of the connections on the circuit board inside it. Once I felt confident, I turned to my malfunctioning keyboard.', 'It took time and I smelled up our apartment, but I did manage to swap out the switch and get my A key working again. It felt great to personally fix something I not only relied on, but loved.', 'Now, there’s an emerging category of keyboards that let users swap out different types of switches without soldering anytime. The freedom to easily give my keyboard a different feel intrigues me. A few days ago I pre-ordered one of these keyboards from a small company called Input Club.', 'If my first attempts at making my own turn out OK, I could see myself making keyboards for friends and presenting them as gifts. After all, friends don’t let friends type on weak keyboards.', 'I’m not alone in my obsession.', 'Marcin Wichary, a designer at design software start-up Figma, got curious about keyboards in 2014 after seeing the typewriters around the headquarters of his former employer, blogging company Medium, and the conference rooms that were named after typewriters.', 'He now has a collection of over 30 keyboards and four typewriters, but not because he wants to type on them — in fact, he still types on standard-issue Apple keyboards — nor to display them for others to admire. Rather, he finds keyboards to be an intellectual and emotional pursuit that involves history, design, engineering and other elements, and is particularly interested in keyboards “with interesting stories behind them.”', 'For example, he owns a wireless chiclet keyboard that shipped with IBM’s PCjr home computer from 1984. The keyboard was widely panned — the New York Times called it “uncomfortable for extended typing” — and IBM wound up offering to replace it with a model resembling its well-liked Selectric typewriters. Jacob Alexander, a co-founder of Input Club, helped him reverse-engineer it so that it could be used with modern devices like an Android phone. “I might be the only person writing on this keyboard in this millennium,” Wichary wrote in a 2017 newsletter.', 'Other people are more concerned with sound and feel. Cal Henderson, co-founder and chief technology officer of Slack, has amassed 30 to 40 keyboards, which he keeps in a cupboard in his home office alongside spare keycaps and cables.', 'Henderson prefers keyboards with clicky keys, those that require more force to push them down and have a tactile bump you can feel with each keystroke. His belief is that each key press should be “rewarding.”', '“I’ve always been accused of being an angry typer. I type very thoughtfully,” he said. “I buy high-quality keyboards so they can stand up to that kind of punishment.” He and his colleagues talk about keyboards and individual components in an internal Slack channel dedicated to mechanical keyboards. The channel has more than 80 members, Henderson said. There has even been discussion of people’s matching keyboards and sneakers. That level of coordination is not for me, but I appreciate the commitment.', 'The chief technology officer of Microsoft, Kevin Scott, has a thing for keyboards, too.', 'Scott told me that when he was a Ph.D. student at the University of Virginia, he started having wrist problems because of all the programming and paper writing he was doing, and his advisor suggested he try a keyboard called a Kinesis Advantage. Comfort is the main reason you get a Kinesis, even if it looks peculiar and has a learning curve. It has two cereal bowl-like indentations, one for each hand to sit on top of.', 'Scott has sworn by the Kinesis for more than two decades, and has multiple backups in case the company goes out of business. “I have a stockpile of five of them sitting in a closet, so if the four or five I have in use break, I will not go without, because I don’t know what I’d do,” he told me.', 'Some Kinesis buyers have defected to the Model 01 from Keyboardio, a company run by former Microsoft program manager Jesse Vincent and his wife, Kaia Dekker.', 'The Model 01 came about after Vincent, who had once bought Microsoft’s ergonomic Natural Keyboard Elite in bulk packs, couldn’t get used to the bowls on the Kinesis Advantage. In 2012, he set out to make something more approachable that didn’t just attract ergonomics wonks. He shared a blog post with photos of his prototypes on the message board Hacker News, which got people’s attention. In 2015 he and Dekker started a Kickstarter campaign, and they raised $652,000, five times more than what they had sought, and sold 2,125 keyboards. Shipments began in 2017.', 'The Model 1 is flatter and more portable than the Kinesis Advantage, and about $20 cheaper, at $329. It also looks less intimidating, with its two wood-clad symmetrical units that can be separated for more comfortable use.', 'Vincent and Dekker now have more than 50 keyboards between them. He’s not sure if they’re for business use or for personal enjoyment. “It’s nice because I get to do something that’s my hobby,” he said.', 'I asked Vincent why there seems to be a movement building around keyboards, and he talked about how the keyboard is the tool he uses to create things, and how he spends so much of his life with it.', '“I think especially as the default options for keyboards have gotten worse and worse and worse, it’s made it easier and easier to notice that you want something better and to start to think about it,” he said. He thinks the rise of PC gaming has helped the market expand, along with falling prices for low-volume manufacturing.', 'Vincent was among the hundreds of people at a keyboard meetup in San Jose in November. He said it was small in comparison with events he’d attended in Japan and Taiwan. But to me it was almost sensory overload — booth after booth of magnificent keyboards. Wichary was there, too, and he shared facts about various models on display.', 'There was, for instance, a Northgate OmniKey Ultra from the late 1980s, and Wichary pointed out that it had a “comma period lock” key. It was conceived to prevent people from accidentally sending less-than or equal-to signs when they hit the comma and period keys, regardless of whether the shift key is being held down. On typewriters from earlier years, even if you weren’t holding down the shift key, a comma or a period resulted every time you hit their corresponding keys, making it easier to add those punctuation marks while writing uppercase letters. Wichary sees “comma period lock” as bringing together the old and new.', 'My level of knowledge is not nearly as vast.', 'And I don’t think I could ever make keyboard production a full-time job the way Vincent and Dekker have.

Five of the ten most destructive fires in California since 2015 have been linked to PG&E equipment, including the 2018 Camp Fire that destroyed the town of Paradise and killed 85 people.', 'Since then, PG&E has been reducing the risk of equipment sparks by shutting off the power in high fire-risk areas during dry, windy weather. It calls these Public Safety Power Shut-Offs, or PSPS events, and in 2019 they left almost a million customers in the dark for seven days.', '“We essentially lost that full week of service. We lost all of our food supply, we were not able to operate,” said Brennen Jensen, who owns the 100-year-old Hotel Charlotte in Groveland, California.', 'Keeping the power on for 16 million Californians is a big job, as is maintaining the integrity of more than 100,000 miles of power lines while keeping it clear of vegetation that could turn a spark into a deadly wildfire. All this while answering to California regulators and, as an investor-owned utility, shareholders.', '“The management of the company mostly tried in the years leading up to Napa, Sonoma, and Paradise to please shareholders by controlling costs,” said Michael Wara, director of the Stanford University Climate and Energy Policy Program.', 'PG&E’s $5 billion 2021 Fire Mitigation Plan also includes 300 new weather stations to monitor for severe conditions; LiDAR, drones and hundreds of cameras to provide 90% visual coverage of high fire-threat areas; hardening the system by doing things like moving 23 miles of line near Paradise underground; and more aggressive clearing of trees around power lines.', 'It’s also testing new technology. For instance, PG&E has partnered with Grass Valley-based startup BoxPower to build  solar-powered microgrids, housed in shipping containers, to provide safe power for customers in remote areas. The first one serves as the full-time power source for five customers in the mountains of Briceburg, California. Until the remote grid turned on in April, they had been living solely off generator power after a 5,000-acre fire destroyed their high voltage line in 2019. PG&E is aiming to have 20 standalone remote grids operational by 2022, with plans for several hundred more. ', '“PG&E is trying everything you can think of because it knows that it needs to repair its relationship with the state of California,” Wara said.', 'PG&E is also building bigger generator powered back-up microgrids to kick on during PSPS outages. Groveland, where Jensen runs her hotel, was supposed to get one in October 2020. PG&E says it’s now delayed until the end of 2021.', '“It’s going to require a lot of nimble, quick responses and significant investment. And I hope that PG&Eis up to the challenge,” Jensen said.', 'Watch the video to hear from more community members and to see the five-customer microgrid and other fire mitigation efforts PG&E says are proof it’s committed to doing better at keeping their power on and keeping them safe.']"

The entire resort city of South Lake Tahoe was ordered to evacuate on Monday. More than 20 people were killed as flash floods in New York and New Jersey caused massive flooding.', 'Those who are living through one of these crises made worse by anthropogenic climate change, are likely consumed with survival — evacuating, cleaning out debris, rebuilding. On the other side of immediate safety concerns, however, is often a new resolve to combat the common factor in these disasters: Climate change. But the size of the problem can make meaningful action seem impossible.', 'Can a single person do anything to meaningfully contribute to climate change relief efforts? Most certainly, say climate change experts. Here are a few simple things you can do right now:', 'Talk about climate change with the people in your life.', '“Every great social justice movement started on the community level,” Jasmine Sanders, executive director of Our Climate, a Washington DC-based youth advocacy organization, told CNBC. That can mean “sitting down with your family to have a conversation about climate change at the dinner table,” she said.', 'So, too, said Jerome Ringo, the co-founder and chairman of climate innovation company Zoetic Global, former leader at the National Wildlife Federation, and global ambassador for the countdown Climate Clock. “Each one teach one,” Ringo told CNBC. When you learn about climate change, pass that information on to your neighbor so they too are able to have a conversation with another person.', '“I call them kitchen conversations where people begin to sit and talk,” Ringo said. A casual conversation could lead to a group coming together and deciding to call their elected representatives or starting a neighborhood recycling program, he said.', 'Take the time to educate yourself about the climate-related stances of elected officials, Adrienne L. Hollis, climate justice and health scientist, told CNBC.', '“Really become familiar with legislation around climate change, for example the executive orders from President Biden, and pieces of legislation that are proposed by various members of Congress,” Hollis said. She focuses on issues of health, environmental justice and climate at her namesake Hollis Environmental Consulting and was previously at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “There are so many opportunities for the public to have input,” Hollis said.', 'If this feels overwhelming to try on your own, join groups that are working on legislative issues already, she said. “People need to know about all of the tools that are available to them, and from that — what tools are needed and missing,” she said. “Get involved locally, regionally and at the federal level.”', 'And keep current on developments. “Knowledge and awareness are power,” Sanders said. “Stay in the know of how climate change is impacting each of us by reading news on a daily basis and then use your superpower to affect change!”', '“The most important thing that individuals can do is vote, and vote on the climate,” Michael E. Mann, professor of atmospheric science at Penn State and director of the Penn State Earth System Science Center, told CNBC.', '“What we really need is systematic change and policies that will rapidly decarbonize our economy, such as subsidies for renewable energy, carbon pricing, and blocking of new fossil fuel infrastructure. As individuals we can’t do these things,” said Mann, who is also the author of “The New Climate War: The Fight to Take Back Our Planet.”', 'Voting is the advice of Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at New York University, too. Specifically, Wagner calls on individuals to “vote well.” You may think that your vote doesn’t really count, given that you’re one voice among millions, but Wagner addresses that in an essay he wrote with the late Martin Weitzman.', '“Get up and vote; it’s the right thing to do. And don’t just vote for the sake of voting. Vote as an informed citizen. Vote well,” Wagner and Weitzman write. ”Vote for a cause larger than yourself. Vote for those who promise more than just to further their own agenda (or yours!). Vote for those who seek to look out for society at large.”', '“To have the most impact on fighting climate change, we need each and every individual to advocate for national and international policies that place a price and cap on carbon emissions,” Jane Gilbert, the first ever Chief Heat Officer of Miami, told CNBC. ', 'The maverick tech billionaire Elon Musk said he supports the idea of a price on carbon, too. “My top recommendation, honestly, would be just add a carbon tax,” Musk told Joe Rogan on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast in February. “The economy works great. Prices and money are just information. ... If the price is wrong, the economy doesn’t do the right thing.”', 'Musk said high concentrations of carbon in the atmosphere and environment are, economically speaking, an “unpriced externality.” An externality happens when some consequence of production is not properly reflected in the market. In this case, it is a negative externality.', 'Those externalities have serious consequences. “Currently, the most vulnerable in our country and world are already paying the price of continuing business as usual,” Gilbert said. “It’s time to place that cost on the fuels itself and take away the land leasing and other subsidies to the fossil fuel industry,” Gilbert said.', 'If a price on carbon were to be implemented, the money raised should be used to “address the inequities of short term price increases as we transition to a clean energy economy and to assist communities in adapting to and recovering from the impacts of climate change,” Gilbert said. ', '“Plant-based eating is a really positive climate influence,” Elin Kelsey, author of “Hope Matters,” told CNBC in a phone conversation in August.', 'Around the globe, livestock are responsible for 14.5% of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Cattle are the worst offenders, responsible for 65% of the emissions caused by all livestock.', '“Whether you’re a flexitarian or vegetarian or vegan, or pescatarian, whatever it is — just eating more plants is is a great direction to be going,” Kelsey told CNBC.', 'Taking responsibility for our own carbon footprint can also mean traveling less said Chris Funk, director of the Climate Hazards Center at UC Santa Barbara and author of the new book, “Drought, Flood, Fire: How Climate Change Contributes to Catastrophes.”', '“According to the EPA, transportation and electricity generation are the two biggest sources of U.S. emissions. Driving less, driving fuel-efficient vehicles, and flying less are straightforward ways that everyone can make a difference,” Funk said ', 'Start a decarbonization plan at home, said Wagner. His own home greening journey was detailed by New York Magazine, and included everything from new insulation to adding a heat pump on the roof and rewiring the house to support it — and it cost over $100,000. But not every project needs to be so extensive.', '“Many households can easily switch to an affordable renewable-oriented electricity plan, and improved insulation and windows make our homes climate-smart while saving us money,” Funk said.', 'As with voting, Wagner provides a rebuke for the statisticians who are ready to provide proof their individual behavior doesn’t matter. “Reducing your own carbon footprint to zero is a noble gesture, but it’s less than a drop in the bucket. Quite literally: the standard U.S. bucket holds about 300,000 drops; but you are one in over 300,000,000 as an American, and you are one in seven billion as a human being,” Wagner and Weitzman write.', '“So why go green at all? Because it’s the right thing to do. It’s also how we learn the values that we have to apply on a much larger scale to tackle climate change,” they write.', 'Also, your behaviors have an impact on those around you. “Recycle. Bike to work. Eat less meat. Maybe go all the way and turn vegetarian. Teach your kids to do the same, and to turn off the water while brushing their teeth. It’s good for you. It’s good for those around you. It’s the right thing to do.”', '“Do anything — anything at all,” Wagner told CNBC. “That begins with talking about climate change. It also means doing what you do best. Students, study. Teachers, teach. Writers, write. Entrepreneurs, invent, build, ship! Whatever it is you do best, consider how climate change figures into it, and do that.”', 'With a bit of research, you are likely to find a community of like-minded individuals, said Kelsey.', '“What are you passionate about? What are you particularly great at....what do you do even if nobody wants you to do it, because you love it so much?” Kelsey told CNBC. “Finding out what really drives you, and recognizing that and then using that voice is the most effective thing to do. ... This individualization and recognizing our own emotional landscape, our own passions, that’s where we do the most good, because those are the things we’ll continue to do.”']"

', 'For the next 25 years this red-hulled Goliath — the length of four football pitches and nine-times the weight of the UK’s new aircraft carrier when fully loaded — will harvest gas from subsea wells and convert it into super-cooled liquefied natural gas. Tankers will visit the ship once a week to offload its LNG for export.', 'The $14bn Prelude project, led by Royal Dutch Shell, is the latest in a surge of new LNG capacity which promises to reshape the oil and gas industry — and with it, the energy markets they serve. Chevron’s Wheatstone LNG development in Australia is due to start producing this month, on the heels of its nearby Gorgon project last year, after a combined $88bn of investment. ExxonMobil, BP, Total and Eni have also made big commitments.', ' Supplies of LNG are on course to increase by 50 per cent between 2014 and 2021. That implies the opening of a new LNG “train” — the facilities that condense gas into liquid form to allow it to be transported long distances by ship — every two to three months. Spencer Dale, chief economist at BP, calls that a “quite astonishing” rate of growth. ', 'The investments are part of a wider dash for gas among the biggest energy companies, as the industry bets that the clean characteristics of gas compared with oil and coal will allow it to keep growing as other fossil fuels decline.', 'Gas emits half as much carbon dioxide as coal when burnt to generate electricity, and at least 75 per cent less nitrogen oxide and other health-harming particles. This makes gas a potential ally in the fights against climate change and air pollution, while providing a hedge for industry against the threat of electric vehicles eroding demand for oil.', 'Companies that once treated gas as the poor relation to “black gold” are now gambling that the colourless commodity can help secure their future in a decarbonising world. Of the 16 new BP projects due on stream between this year and 2021, 12 involve gas rather than oil. Similar shifts are under way across the industry. Gas outweighs oil by a factor of two-to-one among pre-development resources awaiting investment decisions, according to Wood Mackenzie, the energy consultancy.', '“In the past, when you struck gas rather than oil in this industry you were disappointed, but now we go looking for it,” says Claudio Descalzi, chief executive of Eni, the Italian group due to bring the huge Zohr gasfield off the coast of Egypt on stream by the end of this year.', 'The gamble on gas rests in large part on the sector’s ability to squeeze coal out of the global energy system and compete with the rise of wind and solar power.', '“Renewables will dominate in the long run but during the transition, and maybe even at the end of it, there will need to be a stable source of electricity that can step in when wind and solar are not available,” says Maarten Wetselaar, head of Shell’s gas business. “I’m absolutely convinced that gas will provide that role.”', 'Nowhere is more important to the prospects of gas than Asia. China and India alone are expected to account for half of the 30 per cent increase in global energy demand forecast by BP between now and 2035. Coal still accounts for about 60 per cent of electricity generation in China and India, but rising concern about smog — as well as both countries’ commitments under the Paris climate accord — is creating an opening for gas. China aims to increase the share of gas in its total energy consumption from 6 per cent to 15 per cent by 2030. There are signs of growth: Chinese LNG imports increased 38 per cent in the first half of this year, compared with the same period in 2016.', '“We’ll not squeeze out coal overnight, but air pollution is becoming a political problem in China,” says Mr Wetselaar. “The priority has been jobs and cheap electricity but, when you cannot go outside for 30 days because of smog, environmental factors count for more.”', 'The need for regulatory help in driving out coal explains why all the big oil groups support the taxation of carbon emissions — a measure, so far only sporadically adopted around the world, which makes coal more expensive relative to gas. But producers are not relying solely on political intervention to stimulate demand. They are also finding ways to deliver gas more economically. Floating storage and regasification units, or FSRUs — ships which can receive LNG and convert it back into gas — have sprung up on coastlines around the world as a low-cost alternative to building permanent onshore terminals.', 'The number of countries importing LNG has almost doubled in the past decade to 35, in large part because FSRUs have made it affordable in places such as Pakistan, Jordan and Colombia. “It used to take four years and $500m to build an LNG-receiving terminal. Now you can have an FSRU floating off your country 18 months after taking the decision,” says Mr Wetselaar.', 'France’s Total is leading a consortium building an FSRU and associated gas pipelines in Ivory Coast, an example of producers investing in downstream infrastructure to open new markets.', 'As well as seeking a bigger role in electricity generation, gas producers also see growth in the industrial, chemicals and transport sectors. In ships, for example, LNG can be used as a cleaner alternative to heavy fuel oil as the maritime industry faces regulatory pressure to reduce emissions. Carnival, the cruise line operator, has ordered seven LNG-powered ships and Shell is investing in gas infrastructure at ports including Rotterdam and Singapore to encourage cargo carriers to follow suit.', '“Heavy transport by ships, trucks and buses can’t be electrified and the lowest carbon alternative is for them to use LNG,” says Mr Wetselaar.', 'Yet for all the optimism, projects such as Prelude and Wheatstone are fraught with commercial risk. The arrival of large-scale Australian LNG has coincided with the surge of US shale gas. The US is on course to become a net exporter of gas this year for the first time since 1957, as numerous LNG terminals are brought online. By 2022, the US is likely to be vying with Australia and Qatar to be the biggest exporter of LNG, according to the International Energy Agency.', 'This surge of new capacity is calling into question the economic assumptions underpinning the Australian LNG projects and others such as ExxonMobil’s in Papua New Guinea, BP’s in Indonesia and Total’s in Russia. Gas prices in Europe and Asia — the biggest LNG markets — have fallen by over 40 per cent in the past five years, reducing returns on investment below the level anticipated when the projects were approved.', '“An oversupplied LNG market is helping alter the dynamics of the gas market by shifting the balance of power from producers to customers,” says Dan Smith, an analyst at Oxford Economics. “LNG buyers are able to be more demanding and have been pushing for shorter and more flexible contracts.”', 'A market once dominated by long-term contracts between a small number of suppliers, and an equally exclusive club of buyers such as Japan and South Korea, has been blown open by the influx of US gas. A decade ago, more than 95 per cent of LNG contracts were for 10 years or more. Today, that figure is down to about 60 per cent.', '“Up until now, LNG has been a technology with high barriers to entry,” says Noel Tomnay, head of global gas at Wood Mackenzie. “The US is democratising the market and now any Tom, Dick or Harry can access LNG.”', 'Mr Wetselaar insists that moderate prices and proliferating sources of flexible supply and demand are good for customers and producers alike. “Gas needs to be affordable. To grow profitability of this business we need volume growth not margin growth, because margin growth means higher prices which will drive demand away.”  Despite the positive signs in China, low prices have so far failed to stimulate a boom in global gas demand. Consumption growth has slowed from an average of 3 per cent a year in the first decade of this century to about 1.4 per cent annually since 2010.', '“This slowdown has put some producers in a tight corner,” the IEA said in its latest annual outlook. “While gas is set to perform much better than other fossil fuels over the coming decades, some of the pillars on which a bright future for gas have been constructed look a little less solid than they have in the past.”', 'Demand for gas has been held back by two main factors. One is rapid growth in renewable power. In Europe, this has led to the mothballing of some gas-fired power stations as rising wind and solar generation pushes down wholesale electricity prices. The other is that coal remains cheaper to burn than gas in many parts of the world.  Gas producers portray their product as a “bridging fuel” between the eras of hydrocarbons and renewables. The risk for the industry is that advances in battery technology — which allows surplus wind and solar power to be stored for future use — could allow the world to leapfrog gas direct to renewables.', 'Carbon Tracker, a group which monitors climate policy, estimates that $532bn of existing and planned gas projects would become obsolete if the world pursues the aggressive emission cuts needed to limit temperature increases to below 2C above pre-industrial levels, as agreed in the Paris accord.', '“This over-investment in natural gas infrastructure is likely to lead to either emissions overshooting the Paris\u2009goals, or a large number of stranded assets as the shift to cheaper renewables takes place,” says Andrzej Ancygier of Climate Analytics, a green think-tank.', 'Shell’s Mr Wetselaar insists that, under any scenario, gas will be needed to smooth the transition. While batteries can deal with short-term fluctuations in renewable power, they cannot yet address seasonal variations.', 'In the UK, solar power can account for  more than a fifth of electricity generation on a sunny summer day, but contribute almost nothing on a gloomy winter afternoon.  Gas has been critical to Britain’s success in pushing coal to the brink of elimination from its electricity system and reducing emissions to their lowest level since the 19th century, without sacrificing energy security.', 'While the long-mooted “golden age of gas” has yet to fully materialise, global consumption growth is forecast to increase at an average rate of 1.6 per cent a year between now and 2035, according to BP. That is more than twice the 0.7 per cent projected for oil.', 'LNG growth is expected to outstrip the wider gas market and analysts say overcapacity could quickly give way to a supply crunch in the early 2020s once new production is absorbed.', 'After delays and cost-overruns in Australia, companies are cautious about further LNG spending at a time when weak oil prices continue to strain industry finances. Smaller developments are likely to prevail over megaprojects in future.

In Georgia, drivers were paying $2.87 per gallon Tuesday, an increase of of more than 10 cents in just one day and 17 cents in a week.', 'A rise of 3 more cents per gallon would put the average U.S. selling price at the highest level since November 2014.', '“We are seeing the full fledge panic at the moment in some of the places I suspected we might see it,” said Tom Kloza, head of global energy analysis at OPIS. “There aren’t enough drivers to take trucks from terminals that have gasoline to stations. We are seeing a lot of stations running out. Georgia seems to be ground zero.”', 'Kloza said he expects gasoline prices to rise, but not spike wildly higher. The bigger issue is that gasoline will be in short supply in the region, since it takes time to replace once the pipeline is switched on and outages could continue.', 'Gasoline in the pipeline travels at just 5 miles per hour.', 'According to GasBuddy, 7.7% of the gas stations in Virginia were out of fuel Tuesday afternoon, while 8.5% of stations in North Carolina have run dry.

Now that several states have legalized the use of marijuana for some recreational and medicinal purposes, a big untapped market is emerging for cannabis to be used as a building tool.', 'Across America a grassroots effort is underway among builders, architects, material suppliers and farmers to renew this fledgling market. Mixing hemp’s woody core with lime and water produces a natural, light concrete that retains thermal mass and is highly insulating. No pests, no mold, good acoustics, low humidity, no pesticide.It grows from seed to harvest in about four months. ', 'A catalyst that may spark growth in hemp home building is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s,  R-Ky., Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2018, introduced last week. ', 'If passed, the bill — co-introduced by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore. — will remove industrial hemp from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act and allow it to be regulated as an agricultural crop. The bill will also authorize and encourage access to federal research funding for hemp and remove restrictions on banking, water rights and other regulatory barriers the hemp industry currently faces. A companion bill has been introduced in the House.', 'All this has Joy Beckerman, president of the Hemp Industries Association, a D.C.-based nonprofit trade association, very excited. “We’ve increased hemp agriculture in the U.S. to more than 25,000 acres,” she said, “and we hope to triple it this year.” (Last year Colorado was the top hemp grower, at nearly 9,700 acres, followed by Kentucky, at around 3,100 acres.)', 'For years this lanky, woody weed has been poorly misunderstood. Like marijuana, its evil twin, it is of the Cannabis sativa species. But that’s where the similarity ends. While marijuana is largely used for medicinal and recreational purposes, hemp is cultivated for its fiber, hurd and seeds and contains just 0.3 percent of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the compound that gets you high.', 'Today at least 25,000 products — including apparel, foods, plastics, skin products and dietary supplements — are made of hemp, and now, with the rising demand of nature-friendly construction, it’s gaining attention worldwide for its use as an alternative to the ubiquitous fiberglass insulation in homebuilding. Hemp-based structural blocks and prefabricated panels for exterior walls are also being introduced into the market. The reason: It’s nontoxic, fireproof, carbon-capturing, mold- and pest-resistant. ', 'Hempcrete,  also known as hemplime, is a biocomposite made from the inner woody core of the hemp plant that is mixed with a lime-based binder and water. The result is a lightweight insulating material weighing only about an eighth of the weight of concrete. In the United States there are currently only about 50 homes containing hemp, in such states as North Carolina, Virginia, Texas and Hawaii, but this natural wonder has been used in construction around the world for centuries. Today it can be found in hundreds of homes and commercial buildings in Canada and Europe, including an eco-house built by Prince Charles.', 'Unlike the Three Little Pigs’ domiciles, made mainly of straw, sticks or bricks, these aren’t literally hemp houses. They’re conventionally designed and built by conventional, if adventurous builders. The homeowner, however, opts to use hemp-based materials for insulation and/or exterior or interior walls as alternatives to customary fiberglass or foam, concrete and wood. Foundations, framing, electrical, plumbing and HVAC can be standard or incorporate “green” materials and systems.', 'A hemp-savvy architect, engineer or consultant from a hemp products maker is often involved, because the materials have distinct specifications and construction requirements. Hemp is adaptable to any climate, and though it can cost slightly more than typical houses — especially if it’s imported — proponents claim the long-term ROI is worth the bump. That’s because homeowners enjoy long-term energy savings and sometimes lower insurance premiums.', 'More from the Business of Design:', 'Amazing products made of trashSony’s new robot dog', 'The Hemp Business Journal and Vote Hemp, a legislative advocacy group, estimate that the total retail value of all hemp products sold in the United States in 2016 was $688 million, predicting revenues will reach $1.8 billion by 2020. Industrial product sales, including hemp-based building materials, reached $125.5 million in 2016.', 'It’s safe to say that hemp-building products represent a niche market within the wider green building materials industry, which posted $86.6 billion in revenues last year, according to Freedonia Group.', 'Hemp Technologies Global in San Diego was involved in what’s claimed to be the first modern hemp home in the United States, built in 2010 for Russ Martin, the then-mayor of Asheville, North Carolina. Building the 3,400-sq.-ft. contemporary-style showpiece cost $133 per sq. ft., or $452,200, which is on par with today’s conventional rates. Martin reportedly sold the house last year for $685,000. ', '“We supplied and mixed the hempcrete on site that was used for insulation,” said company founder Greg Flavall, explaining part of the building process.', 'That process begins well before any ground is broken. Because many local permitting and building department officials aren’t familiar with hemp products, suppliers like Flavall spend time simply educating them about the materials and providing research data on their viability in terms of strength, thermal properties and other specifications.', 'The same goes for engineers, architects and builders involved in hemp projects, said Luly Abraira, a principal at Asheville-based Hempsteads, formerly Alembic Studio, which designed and consulted on the so-called Nauhaus, a craftsman bungalow in town, as well as a classic two-story house in Virginia Beach.', '“From the outside it looks very normal,” said owner Mike Meehan, who described his seaside home as a clean, green, energy-saving machine.', '“The learning curve can be a barrier,” Abraira said, “so there’s a lot of handholding.” There still aren’t international standards for building with hemp, or codes regulating how it should be used structurally or safely. ASTM International, a technical standards organization, formed a committee to address this in 2017.', 'Hempcrete is widely used as natural insulation between exterior structural walls built from wood, steel or concrete. It’s airtight yet breathable and flexible, but not load-bearing. “When the cast mix cures, it can be finished in the inside with lime or clay plaster and masonry or wood on the outside,” explained Mario Machnicki, president of American Lime Technology in Chicago, whose hempcrete products have been used in roughly 30 projects in the U.S. and Canada.', 'Machnicki and other suppliers said that hempcrete can cost slightly more than conventional insulation, especially when the hemp hurd has to be imported. “When we started the business 12 years ago, all our hemp was imported from the U.K. and was expensive to ship,” he said. As U.S.-grown hemp becomes more available, pricing for hempcrete will be even more price-competitive, he added.', 'Higher costs, though, won’t necessarily hinder the hemp house market. Already, a segment of the homeowner population has been willing to invest extra for solar power, geothermal heating and air-conditioning and other sustainable building materials, often with the expectation that they’ll save money in the long run on energy costs. There’s also the intangible value of being an innovator and early-adopter, not to mention the “cool” factor.', 'Just BioFiber, founded in Calgary, Alberta, in 2014, has patented prefabricated, structural building blocks made from hemp. The interlocking blocks resemble Legos, said CEO Terry Radford, a former IT executive turned hemp entrepreneur. “Our first project is what the owner calls Harmless Home, built on Vancouver Island,” he reported. Scheduled to be completed this summer, the sustainable, off-the-grid custom-designed home features solar electricity and hot water and a hydroponic greenhouse for growing organic fruits and vegetables.', 'No doubt, the hemp homebuilding sector is still in its nascent stage. No major homebuilding companies specialize in using hemp, so it’s more of a one-off situation for local designers and builders. To that point, a media representative for the National Association of Home Builders, told CNBC that “unfortunately, we don’t have any information on the use of hemp in residential construction.”', 'The holdup on this side of the Atlantic is a legal limbo, combined with a lack of availability of raw hemp and general awareness about hempcrete’s qualities among consumers, homebuilders and municipalities that issue building permits.', '“There’s still a lot of ‘Reefer Madness’ out there,” lamented Erica McBride, executive director of the National Hemp Association, a grassroots organization based in Washington, D.C., that advocates for the use of hemp in foods, medicines, clothing, paper, auto interiors and building materials.', 'McBride’s maddening reference was to the 1936 exploitation film that demonized pot as “the deadly scourge that drags our children into the quagmires of degradation.” A year later Congress passed the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937, which essentially outlawed growing either plant. In 1972 the feds classified all cannabis as a Schedule 1 controlled substance, making it as illegal as heroin and LSD.', 'Yet McConnell’s bill may offer hope for the industry.  Congress must pass a farm bill by the end of September, when the current law expires, and a spokesman for McConnell said the senator will be looking at “all available options” to get his hemp bill signed into law.', 'Hemp proponents are optimistic their products and designs will ultimately gain wide acceptance. “If we can build houses at lower costs, and that are healthier, stronger and longer-lasting than those built with synthetic materials, there’s no reason not to,” said Machnicki. “It’s just a matter of time.”', '— By Bob Woods, special to CNBC.com']"

', '“Due to the global semiconductor shortage, we are also experiencing some effects especially around certain set products and display production,” said Ben Suh, head of Samsung’s investor relations, on a call with analysts.', '“We are discussing with retailers and major channels about supply plans so that we are able to allocate the components to the products that have more urgency or higher priority in terms of supply.”', 'Samsung’s co-chief executive and mobile chief, Koh Dong-jin, said at a shareholder meeting in March that there’s a serious imbalance in supply and demand of chips in the IT sector. At the time, the company said it might skip the launch of the next Galaxy Note smartphone.', 'LG said it is “closely monitoring the situation as no manufacturer can be free of the problem if it gets prolonged,” according to The Financial Times. LG did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.', 'Production of low-margin processors, such as those used to weigh clothes in a washing machine or toast bread in a smart toaster, has also been hit. While most retailers are still able to get their hands on these products at the moment, they may face issues in the months ahead.', 'Even dog-washing businesses are suffering, according to The Washington Post. CCSI, which makes electronic dog-washing booths in the Illinois village of Garden Prairie, was recently told by its circuit board supplier that the usual chips weren’t available, according to the report.', 'The business, which did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment, was reportedly offered a different chip, but that required the company to adjust its circuit boards, raising costs in the process.', '“This particular problem affects all aspects of manufacturing, from little people to big conglomerates,” President Russell Caldwell reportedly said. “Literally we have corn fields around us … there’s not a lot here.”', 'Many companies — particularly those in China who have been hit by sanctions — are boosting their stockpiles of in-demand chips to try to ride out the storm, but that’s making chips even harder to get hold of for other firms.', 'The automotive sector, which relies on chips for everything from the computer management of engines to driver assistance systems, is still the hardest hit. Companies like Ford, Volkswagen and Jaguar Land Rover have shut down factories, laid off workers and slashed vehicle production.', 'Stellantis, the world’s fourth biggest car maker, said on Wednesday that the chip shortage had gotten worse in the last quarter. Richard Palmer, the chief financial officer of the firm that was created through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot maker PSA, warned the disruption could last into 2022.

The vast majority of the world’s chips are made in China, while the U.S. is the second biggest producer. ', 'The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, has said it wants to build up chip manufacturing capacity in Europe as part of an effort to become more self-reliant on what it sees as a critical technology.', 'Europe currently accounts for less than 10% of global chip production, although that is up from 6% five years ago. It wants to boost that figure to 20% and is exploring investing 20-30 billion euros ($24-36 billion) to make it happen.', 'U.S. tech giant Intel has offered to help but it reportedly wants 8 billion euros in public subsidies toward building a semiconductor factory in Europe.', 'Pat Gelsinger, Intel’s CEO, met with two EU commissioners in Brussels including Thierry Breton last Friday after meeting with German ministers the day before.', '“What we’re asking from both the U.S. and the European governments is to make it competitive for us to do it here compared to in Asia,” Gelsinger told Politico Europe in an interview, where he was cited saying that he was seeking roughly 8 billion euros in subsidies.', 'Intel also announced in March that it intends to spend $20 billion on two new chip plants in Arizona.', '“It’s going take two or three years before we start to see that,” said Gartner’s Priestley. “But that’s really looking to meet future demand.”']"

But, while existing services use satellites in distant orbits, Starlink satellites orbit closer to the Earth and could potentially boost the speeds that passengers see inflight. Hofeller added that Starlink “provides a global mesh,” so that “airlines are flying underneath that global mesh have connectivity anywhere they go.”', '“Passengers and customers want a great experience that [geosynchronous satellite] systems simply cannot provide,” Hofeller said.', 'After Gogo’s sale of its commercial aviation unit, the company focuses on the business aviation marketplace. Gogo’s stock fell 9% in trading on Thursday, below $13 a share, amid the SpaceX news on fears of a potential new competitor in the aviation broadband space.', 'Starlink is the company’s capital-intensive project to build an interconnected internet network with thousands of satellites, known in the space industry as a constellation, designed to deliver high-speed internet to consumers anywhere on the planet. SpaceX first rolled out the service with a beta program for select consumers for $99 a month, and in the past year has sought regulatory approval to test the network inflight and expand the service to large moving vehicles, like ships and trucks.', 'Hofeller noted that Starlink antennas for aircraft would be “a derivative” of the ones it sends to consumers, but still will be built in-house by SpaceX.', 'While Starlink satellites can service “quite a bit of the aviation market” already, Hofeller also said SpaceX will have to have inter-satellite links – or what the company calls “space lasers” – to service trans-oceanic flights. SpaceX is adding inter-satellite links to the next generation of its Starlink satellites.']"

It comes as Peloton is attempting to turn around a recent sharp decline in its share price.', 'Peloton shares initially jumped on the news before they were halted shortly after 11 a.m. for trading volatility. The stock closed the day down 4.6%. ', 'McCarthy, a former Netflix and Spotify executive, has been candid in recent press interviews about what he viewed as an opportunity at Peloton to cut hardware costs. This, in theory, would lower the barrier to entry for a consumer, and then the company could pivot its focus to growing monthly recurring revenues.', '“The pricing changes being announced today are part of CEO Barry McCarthy’s vision to grow the Peloton community,” a company spokesman told CNBC.', 'Effective June 1, the price of Peloton’s all-access subscription plan in the United States will go up to $44 per month, from $39. In Canada, the fee will rise to $55 per month, from $49. Pricing for international members will remain unchanged, Peloton said. The cost of a digital-only membership, for people who don’t own any of Peloton’s equipment, will still be $12.99 a month.', 'Peloton explained the decision in a company blog post shared with CNBC. “There’s a cost to creating exceptional content and an engaging platform,” the company said. The price increases will allow Peloton to continue to deliver to users, it added.', 'Meantime, beginning Thursday at 6 p.m. ET, Peloton will slash the prices of its connected-fitness bikes and treadmills in hopes of making its products more affordable to a wider audience and increase its market share coming off of a pandemic-fueled surge in demand.', 'Peloton is also currently testing a rental option in select U.S. markets, where users can pay a monthly fee anywhere between $60 to $100 for a rented Bike and for access to its workout content library.

It has more than 6.6 million total members, including people who only pay for access to its workout classes.', 'The company has already shown a penchant for making its hardware more affordable, particularly as McCarthy pushes the subscription model. Earlier this month, it began selling its new strength product, Peloton Guide, for $295. That’s $200 less than what Peloton last November said the device, bundled with a heart rate armband, would retail for.', 'In recent weeks, Peloton’s stock has been trading below $29, where it priced at its initial public offering in 2019, also putting it back at pre-pandemic levels.

That’s down from its previous spending threshold of  $50, and its prior delivery window of three to five days.', '  The shift is one of the first major changes Marc Lore has made at  Wal-Mart since the retailer purchased his start-up, Jet.com, last  year. ', '  Wal-Mart will give the undisclosed number of members who paid for  a ShippingPass subscription a full refund. ', '  “In this day and age, two-day shipping is really just table  stakes,” Lore, now president and CEO of Walmart U.S. eCommerce,  said Monday. “We don’t think it’s necessary to charge a membership [fee] for it.”', '  Wal-Mart first started testing its ShippingPass program in  May 2015. It pumped up the program ahead of Amazon’s second Prime  Day sales event, when it offered a free 30-day trial. But the  program never took off to the same degree as Prime.', '  Though Wal-Mart’s service offered an unlimited number of free  deliveries for just $49 a year — $50 less than the cost of  Prime — it lacked the ancillary perks that have made Prime  so addictive. Those include Amazon’s vast network of streaming  video, music and unlimited photo storage. There also are  members-only deals and it recently introduced a credit card  that gives Prime members 5 percent back on their Amazon  purchases.', '  These types of perks encourage shoppers to stay loyal to  Amazon.', '  In an interview with CNBC over the holidays, Leon Nicholas,  chief insights officer at Kantar Retail, said Wal-Mart was simply  too late to the subscription game. Roughly one-third of Wal-Mart  shoppers are Prime members, according to Kantar’s data  — and they have little incentive to switch, Nicholas  said.', '  Prime has more than 50 million members in the U.S., according to  Cowen and Co. Its renewal rates have been pegged at north of  90 percent. According to Kantar’s data, the biggest reason Prime  members renew their subscriptions is for free two-day shipping  — which Wal-Mart will now provide for customers  spending $35 or more. ', 'Wal-Mart’s offer will apply to 2 million products, compared  with more than 40 million eligible products on Prime. Lore  emphasized that the 2 million items account for the vast majority  of what its customers are purchasing. ', '  “There won’t be too many products that you’ll want that won’t be  available [for] two-day shipping,” Lore said, adding that the  items will be skewed toward everyday essentials including pet  food and cleaning supplies.', '  Wal-Mart’s lower spending threshold comes as retailers including  Target and Urban Outfitters have said that a  larger-than-anticipated acceleration in their online sales dented  their margins over the holidays. ', '  Though Lore did not address how the shift could impact the  company’s margins, he said the minimum spending requirement  encourages shoppers to build bigger baskets. The executive  founded Jet.com on that principle, by using a pricing algorithm  that saves customers money when they add more items to their  basket. Jet also offers free shipping on orders of $35 or more.', '  Spokeswoman Danit Marquardt added that the scale of Wal-Mart’s  distribution network allows it to create efficiencies that it can  then pass along to the consumer through lower prices and shipping  costs.', ' “It’s not going to affect our pricing at all. In fact,  we’re going to look to get more aggressive on the price side,”  Lore said. He said more changes to Wal-Mart’s digital strategy  will be announced shortly.']"

Those surveyed included households in Canada and 13 U.S. states: California, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Ohio, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming.', 'The majority of these Starlink users are in rural or remote areas, such as farmland or wilderness, with limited access to terrestrial broadband options — and a few with no access altogether.', '“I expect to keep the service long term,” a user in Montana told CNBC. “The price of the beta for the service is more reasonable than any other option we have, and those are worse in performance. I will keep Starlink as long as its the only broadband option available to me.”', 'Starlink is the company’s capital-intensive project to build an interconnected internet network with thousands of satellites, known in the space industry as a constellation, designed to deliver high-speed internet to consumers anywhere on the planet.', 'SpaceX launched the “Better than Nothing Beta” program for the public in October, and the majority of users CNBC surveyed received invitations to join between November and February. The service is priced at $99 a month in the U.S. under the beta, with a $499 upfront cost for the equipment customers need to connect to the satellites — plus taxes, shipping and any accessories needed to mount the antenna.', 'CNBC surveyed users on total cost, the installation process, what they thought of SpaceX’s equipment, internet speed, reliability of the service, what their service alternatives were, their experience with customer service, any concerns they had, and their overall impressions. Here’s what users said.', 'SpaceX priced the user equipment well below its actual cost, with the company currently absorbing about two-thirds of the cost of the customer equipment.', 'Users’ upfront costs ranged from $550 to as much as $800 — varying based on taxes, shipping costs, and additional equipment needed such as roof mounts or third-party items for installation.', 'Most users found the service’s monthly price of $99 to be fair, and often a discount to other satellite broadband services and terrestrial options — especially given the average speed of Starlink’s service. SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell last week said the company does not plan to add “tiered pricing to consumers,” emphasizing that it wants “to try to keep it as simple as possible and transparent as possible.”', 'The “Starlink Kit” that is sent to customers includes four significant parts: The user terminal (also known as the antenna), a tripod mount, a Wi-Fi router, and a power supply. SpaceX also offers rooftop mounting options for an additional cost.', 'Users were largely impressed with quality of the equipment, especially the antenna — which is nicknamed “Dishy McFlatface” in the SpaceX guide.', '“Barring a massive hailstorm, I don’t see much hurting this thing at all,” one user said.', 'A handful of users were disappointed in the quality of SpaceX’s supplied Wi-Fi router, with several choosing to go with third-party router options. A Montana user described it as “a brick with a wifi signal,” noting that it is quick to set up but lacks configuration options aside from setting the network’s password.', '“I opted to use my own router and plugged directly into the port their router would have been connected to,” the Montana user said.', 'The installation process delivered the widest range of user opinions, as some — mostly those who have performed rooftop equipment installations before — found it a very easy process while others had to spend hours to get the antenna working.', '“The hardest part was getting up on the roof, mounting the dish and running the wire from the outside to the inside of the house,” a Colorado user said.', 'Obstructions to the antenna’s view of the sky, and therefore connection to overhead satellites, was the most frequent issue for users installing the dish. A mobile application for Starlink users includes an augmented reality feature to check for obstructions and help find the right place to install the antenna.', '“My trees are really tall and I underestimated the need for the Starlink’s obstruction-detecting app to really show 0 trees,” a user in Oregon said.', 'SpaceX told the Federal Communications Commission in February that Starlink’s internet service is “exceeding” 100 megabits per second download speeds, 20 Mbps upload speeds, and latency “at or below 31 milliseconds.” Latency is the amount of delay in an internet network, defining how much time it takes a signal to travel back and forth from a destination. Latency and download speeds are key measures for an internet service provider.', 'The company’s report to the FCC matched what CNBC was told by users, who reported download speeds ranging between 60 Mbps and 150 Mbps — with some even reporting peak speeds near 200 Mbps. Latency also matched expectations, as most users reported latency of about 30 milliseconds — with some in the low 20 milliseconds.', 'Musk promised earlier this year that Starlink’s performance will continue to improve as the company launches more satellites, saying “speed will double” to about 300 Mbps later this year and latency will be more consistently in the 20 millisecond range.', 'SpaceX has warned that users would experience drops in service during the beta, given it does not yet have its full satellite fleet in orbit. In a 24-hour period, most users saw a handful of downtimes between three and five minutes. Sometimes downtimes were as short as 20 seconds, while a few users reported downtimes between 10 and 20 minutes. The Starlink application also gives users a countdown to when the next satellite is expected to reconnect service.', '“The service is quite reliable, there are a few outages once in a while,” a Maine user said. “We mostly use it to watch Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube. We do a bit of gaming as well on the system with no issues.”', 'Users who spoke to CNBC said they use multiple devices without any impact on the service’s quality or speed.', '“We are online all day, every day on meetings. It sustains that easily. We also use streaming services. Combined with my in-laws, we have at least 25 devices (smart phones, laptops, desktops, iPads, smart tv, smart home devices, etc.),” a user in Minnesota said.', 'In addition to the reliability of the internet service itself, users said the Starlink equipment has held up well in the elements. Users reported the Starlink antenna continuing to work in the midst of heavy winds, rainfall and snowstorms. Additionally, as some users’ remote locations require they pay close attention to power consumption, users say the equipment does not draw too much power, with a user in California saying that “it’s about the same consumption as the flood light bulb that lights our driveway.”', 'Users reported a wide variety of prior services they had before Starlink, ranging from other satellite broadband companies to low-speed wired networks to cellular hotspots — and some with no prior service at all.', 'Starlink users most commonly switched for one of three reasons: Price, speed and data restrictions (also known as “caps”). A user in Ohio said they paid $180 per month to a local service provider that advertised faster speeds, but they found Starlink to be faster on average. A California user previously had satellite service they said “was slightly more reliable” in terms of outages, but download speeds were 1 Mbps with a latency of around 1,000 milliseconds.', '“I keep asking my local [telecommunications technicians] if fiber will ever roll out in my town, and they say ‘5 years to never’ each time,” a Montana user said.', 'A user in Canada said their area has two local “high speed” internet service providers but that the cost was far too high by comparison.', '“Both require substantial investment in hardware (towers, dishes, etc), have pretty restrictive data-caps and do not guarantee speeds. In short, they are s---,” the Canadian user said.', 'SpaceX’s core business to date has been launching rockets, so the customer service aspect of becoming an internet service provider is new to the company.

24,"JBS cyberattack: From gas to meat, hackers are hitting the nation, and consumers, where it hurts",2021-06-02T17:19:50+0000,"['Cybersecurity is a topic that often fails to get the attention of the public until a headline hits about a company that has their personal information, including credit card and Social Security numbers, being the victim of a hack. But over the past month, a different threat has taken precedence that goes much deeper into the psyche, and everyday lives, of Americans: ransomware attacks that take down major energy and food supply infrastructure and raise fears about being able to buy key consumer commodities like gas and meat at affordable prices.', 'A month ago, the hack of the Colonial Pipeline, which controls 45% of fuel in the Eastern U.S., led to panic buying of gas. This week’s ransomware attack on the world’s biggest meat processing company, JBS, escalated concerns about the potential for a spike in meat prices and food supply as a national security threat.', 'These cyberattacks have evolved beyond theft of data to physical assets with consumer impacts. Hackers often encrypt data on systems and demand ransom to decrypt it, but in these cases, the primary targets have shifted from the data alone to consumer-facing services. On Wednesday, the ferry service to popular New England vacation destination Martha’s Vineyard was a minor example of the infrastructure added to the list of ransomware attack targets. It’s not a new idea — it can be seen in already common cyber incidents like taking down consumer websites in denial of service attacks — but in the Colonial and JBS hacks, the criminals are digging deeper into critical national infrastructure controlled by business interests.', '“There is a growing trend of cyber criminals going after bigger fish now and ripple effects in the supply chain,” said Derek Manky, chief of security insights and global threat alliances at Fortinet’s FortiGuard Labs. “It’s getting down to the producer level and if they can hit that target effectively it will have an impact on the consumer, not targeting the consumer directly, but it does have that consequence.”', 'JBS has a global supply chain that relies on connections as far apart as Australia (one of the largest sources of imported beef to the U.S. after Canada) to North America. The cyberattack led to temporary shutdowns of several plants in the U.S., though the company said many operations were coming back online Wednesday and facilities shipping product again, easing concerns about pricing.', 'The underlying cyber issues for the food sector, however, will remain.', 'The meat processing industry has become highly concentrated among a handful of players including JBS, which controls over 20% of the cattle harvesting industry in the U.S. And it is an industry which has been behind on building its cyber defenses, according to experts.', '“This attack demonstrates the reach of these events, shutting down meat plants in Australia and impacting meat processing in North America,” said John Hoffman, senior research fellow at the University of Minnesota’s Food Protection and Defense Institute and a retired U.S. Army Colonel.', 'JBS has grown from a Brazilian cattle company to a global giant operating in over six countries and that through ownership of the Swift brand became the world’s largest beef processor. In the U.S., it sells beef and pork through major retailers including Costco.', '“It brings home these attacks, when they occur now, are no longer local,” Hoffman said. “This is a primary protein supplier and major supplier, and simultaneous effects in North America and Australia.”', 'The complexity built into the current global food supply chain can benefit consumers in keeping costs down and providing yearlong access to items grown around the world depending on seasonality. But that complexity also results in risks that rise to the level of critical infrastructure.', 'For a hacker whose objective in a ransomware attack is to force payment, a food manufacturing and processing company like JBS, a centralized node in a consolidated industry, makes for a good target. If successfully attacked, the hack can result in widespread problems from the cattle on the pasture to the feedlots and into the grocery store. JBS USA says it has the capacity to process more than 200,000 cattle, 500,000 hogs, 45 million chickens and 80,000 small stock (lambs, sheep, goats and veal calves) per week.', 'Covid exposed how the concentration in the meat processing sector could quickly create unexpected issues related to food security and pricing. The ability to delivery livestock to plants was cut off amid shutdowns for health safety reasons, and those supply chains were thrown out of alignment for weeks, hitting both the farms and the consumers.', 'A 2019 fire at a single Tyson Foods processing plant in Kansas caused cattle prices to fall and retail beef prices to jump. A hint of those market dislocations was seen again on Tuesday. Cattle futures fell on fears that meat processing shutdowns would suspend the ability to move cows from the pasture and feedlot to the slaughterhouse, while at the same time fears rose about potential price hikes in stores and restaurants.', '“This is another demonstration of how vulnerable the beef supply chain is,” said Bill Bullard, the CEO of R-Calf USA, a group representing cattle ranching interests which has been pressing the government for years to do more about consolidation in the beef industry. JBS and its peers are under existing antitrust scrutiny from the federal government.', 'JBS, Tyson, Cargill and National Beef are the four dominant players in the meatpacking industry.', '“Centralized systems are vulnerable to all kinds of shocks,” Bullard said. “Cattle is the single-largest sector of agriculture and a major protein source for Americans.”', 'The food and agriculture sector has not received the attention from the government when it comes to national security threats that other sectors have historically. It was not deemed a critical infrastructure sector by the federal government until 2003, and many industry players are still playing catch-up on technology. The Food Safety Modernization Act of 2010, meanwhile, placed limited emphasis on cybersecurity.', '“I think this sends a strong message to both government and industry that they need to work on hardening these systems” Hoffman said. “The food industry will really have to step up their cyber game, take a critical look at each major component of infrastructure and supply chain segments.”', 'Meat processing companies have legacy operating technology systems that may have been installed decades ago and are not replaced every few years like IT systems. These OT systems running plant floors are now being connected to each other and with IT systems through new Internet of Things architecture, creating vulnerabilities for hackers to exploit. In a meat processing plant this setup can include devices like multiple digital sensors monitoring temperature and pressure and ingredients, all connected to a global network for packaging and distribution — and executive management and managers in plants using the real-time data dashboards globally — creating multiple attack points.', '“There is a path of least resistance to go after IT and OT systems on the plant floor that have critical dependencies on those IT systems,” Manky said. ', 'For financial reasons, as well as data consistency, it can make sense to have a centralized network rather a highly distributed architecture across an organization. “There is a lot of shared infrastructure on all systems tied tightly together,” said John Sheehy, senior vice president, research and strategy at IOActive, which has been studying the threat of food supply chain hacking for years.', 'JBS has not offered much information about the nature of the hack, but did indicate it had backups available, which is considered a fundamental part of competent cyber strategy. But experts said there were questions about its “segmentation” of technology that will need to be answered in an attack that took down operations in both the U.S. and Australia. It is possible the company took down some operations as a preventative measure.', 'JBS did not respond to a request for comment.', 'Concerns exist that nation-state actors will test the pressure points of critical infrastructure through hacks so that during future periods of geopolitical conflict they can sow more chaos by disrupting supply chains. Food supply of an adversary is an example. The JBS attack, based on all the available information, does not rise to that level. It was criminal, if strategic in nature, but according to the U.S. government, it is one more example of Russia providing safe haven to hackers hitting key supply chains, an issue expected to be on the agenda when President Biden meets with Russian president Vladimir Putin later this month in Geneva for a summit.', '“This is the second major ransomware attack where the government has identified the attackers are geographically based in Russia and this is a significant political issue,” Sheehy said. “It is not clear there is any Russian government support for these criminal organizations, but there is concern they are allowing them to operate fully.”  ', 'The idea that a ransomware attack could ripple through the supply chain and end up hitting consumers is not unprecedented. The 2019 ransomware attack on metals giant Norsk Hydro is in some respects similar as far as a broad supply chain threat stretching from the commodities market to the consumer. But the JBS hack could be a turning point for the food sector.', 'The mind of a cybercriminal is less focused on strategic national security implications than dollar signs, but the potential payout is larger if they can take down a supply chain and demand higher ransom as a result of the attack’s scope. That implies a sector like food with a consolidated global supply chain and distribution will remain under threat.', '“It was aluminum yesterday and beef today, and pork tomorrow. Expect more of these attacks to be happening,” Manky said.', 'Meat processing is a low-margin business subject to greater budget limitations than early adopters of new technology, such as cloud companies and financials, and lower spending on cyber will continue to make it a likely target of more frequent attacks.', '“That is an issue food supply companies will have to face,” Sheehy said. “Food security will be more front and center just like the pipeline issue.”', 'With JBS saying most operations are coming back online, the worst-case scenario of extended plant shutdowns and price shocks through the food system may be avoided. But experts say even a few days of a distribution outage in the food sector can have major consequences and much of the meat processing industry remains vulnerable to attacks, is more likely to be targeted after JBS, and even if companies in the sector take this opportunity to increase cyber budgets, it is a multi-year effort during which present vulnerabilities will persist.', '“The more this happens, the more they [criminal hackers] learn from their own successes and that unfortunately has the classic dollar signs flashing in their eyes. They know they can hit where it hurts,” Manky said.']"

As crude  prices have plummeted, bargain-buying has driven up demand, while  owners have moved more aggressively to scrap vessels to head off  the kind of surplus seen in the dry bulk market.', '  Symeon Pariaros, chief administrative officer of Athens-run and  New York-listed shipping firm Euroseas, said the outlook for the  dry bulk market was “very challenging”.', '  “Demand fundamentals are so weak. The Chinese economy, which is  the main driver of dry bulk, is way below expectations,” he  added. “Only companies with very strong balance sheets will get  through this storm.”', '  The dry bulk shipping downturn began in 2008, after the onset of  the financial crisis, and has worsened significantly this year as  the Chinese economy has slowed. The Baltic Exchange’s main BDI  index - which gauges the cost of shipping such commodities, also  including cement and fertiliser - is more than 95 percent down  from a record high hit in 2008.', '  The index is often regarded as a forward-looking economic  indicator. With about 90 percent of the world’s traded goods by  volume transported by sea, global investors look to the BDI for  any signs of changes in sentiment for industrial demand.', '  “The state of the dry bulk market especially indicates that  economies worldwide are likely to stay weak, much to the  disappointment of central banks ... FX traders, miners, steel  makers, trading houses, and commodity economies,” said Basil  Karatzas, head of New York consultancy and brokerage Karatzas  Marine Advisors & Co.', '  Ratings agency Fitch downgraded the shipping sector to negative,  from stable, this month due to slowing global trade and an  economic slowdown in emerging markets, adding that dry bulk would  remain under pressure.', ' Commodity pressure', '  Slowing demand and concerns over the health of the Chinese and  global economies have pushed the 19-commodity Thomson  Reuters/Core Commodity CRB Index, which tracks the prices of 19  commodities including oil and grains, to its lowest level since  2002.', '  “There is no doubt that the overall macro situation is one that  does not engender a lot of confidence for increased trade flows  in 2016 and beyond,” said Khalid Hashim, managing director of  Precious Shipping, one of Thailand’s largest dry cargo ship  owners.', '  Worsening conditions have already claimed casualties.', '  In September, Japanese bulk carrier Daiichi Chuo Kisen Kaisha  filed for protection from creditors, and private equity backed  Global Maritime Investment Cyprus Ltd filed for Chapter 11  bankruptcy protection in the United States.', '  Smaller dry bulk ship owners are expected to struggle in coming  months.', '  “There are clearly big problems for almost all dry bulk owners,  certainly those who cannot subsidise dry bulk through ownership  in tankers. Debt can only be serviced through reserves of capital  and not from cash-flow,” said Tony Foster, chief executive of  British shipping asset manager Marine Capital.', '  “Public companies will issue discounted shares. Small private  companies without obvious external support will be at the most  risk.”', '  Ship owners are also contending with more vessel orders, which  are expected to increase oversupply further.', '  While the dry bulk market has been in a downturn since 2008,  there have been brief rebound periods of relatively good earnings  in that time that emboldened ship owners to order more vessels,  which normally take up to three years to deliver.', '  “Too many factors are against ship owners at present, and January  sees a disproportionate delivery of vessels from the shipyards,”  said Karatzas.', '  Analysis from Axia Capital Markets showed the cumulative loss of  revenues for 13 shipping companies publicly listed in New York  reached over $3.36 billion in the first nine months of 2015.', '  “Given the current oversupply of vessels in the marketplace that  has built up over the past five years, we expect rates to remain  at depressed levels for at least two more years as the market  struggles to find a new equilibrium,” said Robert Perri of Axia  Capital Markets.', ' Diverging fortunes', '  By contrast, demand for oil tankers and the rates they command  have surged to their highest levels since 2008 in the past three  months.', '  Dry bulk shipping markets have been hit hard by a slide in demand  for coal by China, which is also trying to ease its dependence on  the polluting fuel and meet environmental pledges.', '  But the country has been looking to boost strategic reserves of  crude, taking advantage of multi-year lows in prices, which has  helped the oil tanker market rally. Earlier this month China said  it more than doubled the size of its strategic crude oil reserves  between November 2014 and the middle of this year, a rate  exceeding analysts’ estimates.', '  Oil tanker players have been more conservative since 2008 in  ordering ships as they experienced rock-bottom rates that saw  earnings falling below zero as recently as last year, meaning  owners clocked up losses every day. The scrapping of tankers,  which picked up in 2011, has also shrunk the fleet.', '  Average earnings for supertankers hauling 2 million barrels of  oil on the benchmark Middle East Gulf to Japan route have surged  to over $110,000 a day.', '  In contrast, average earnings for capesize ships, among the  largest vessels used to haul coal and iron ore, have slumped to  under $5,000 a day in recent weeks - below the basic operating  cost level a ship needs to break even, which is around $8,000.', '  “The (tanker) market is on fire,” said Deutsche Bank analyst Amit  Mehrotra, but added: “Owners of dry bulk ships are likely to  spend the holiday break quietly reflecting on how they will  further endure the worst market many have seen in their  lifetimes.”']"

His brother, Mark, trailblazing female aviator Wally Funk and Dutch teenager Oliver Daemen were also in the spacecraft.', 'New Shepard lifted off from Blue Origin’s West Texas launch site at 8:12 a.m. local time. A capsule carrying Bezos and the other passengers rocketed past the Karman line at an altitude of 107 kilometers (66 miles) above the Earth. The crew experienced a few moments of weightlessness, before the capsule returned home. The flight lasted 10 minutes and 10 seconds.', 'The world’s richest person, who is worth an estimated $205 billion, began dreaming of space travel at an early age. He had referred to the trip as “the greatest adventure.”', '“Best day ever!” Bezos said after Tuesday’s return to Earth. “My expectations were high and they were dramatically exceeded.”', 'The historic space flight is the most public display yet of Bezos’ ambitions outside of Amazon. Two weeks earlier, he stepped down as CEO of Amazon and turned the helm over to Andy Jassy, who previously ran Amazon’s cloud-computing division. Bezos announced in February that he would transition into the role of executive chairman, allowing him to spend more time on personal pursuits like Blue Origin and philanthropy. ', 'The changing of the guard brought an end to Bezos’ legendary run leading Amazon since its inception in 1994. ', 'Bezos’ appetite for innovation seeped through all levels of the company, cemented by his credo that it was “always Day 1 at Amazon.” He encouraged his employees to take risks, even if that led to spectacular failures, like the ill-fated Fire Phone. ', '“I’ve made billions of dollars of failures at Amazon.com. Literally,” Bezos said in a 2014 interview with Business Insider. “You might remember Pets.com or Kozmo. It was like giving myself a root canal with no anesthesia. None of those things are fun, but they don’t matter. What matters is that companies that don’t continue to experiment, companies that don’t embrace failure, they eventually get in a desperate position where the only thing they can do is make a ‘Hail Mary’ bet at the end of their corporate existence. I don’t believe in bet-the-company bets.”', 'Inside Amazon, Bezos became known for his limitless curiosity and, occasionally, a flaring temper. As CEO, he would greenlight big, sweeping ideas and set seemingly impossible deadlines, according to employees who worked closely with the founder. Even as Amazon grew, Bezos could still be a micromanager, checking in with teams personally to make sure they were on track to meet targets. ', 'Bezos instituted an early rule at Amazon which dictated that teams (“no larger than can be fed by two pizzas”) operate autonomously, tackle big issues and move fast. The same rule also meant teams could overlap on projects and compete with one another for resources, “replicating the Darwinian realities of surviving in nature,” according to “The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon,” by journalist and biographer Brad Stone. ', 'Arrangements such as these fueled reports that Amazon could be a cutthroat and bruising place to work. In recent years, members of Amazon’s corporate and blue-collar workforce have criticized the company’s treatment of employees. Scrutiny increased during the pandemic and a high-stakes union vote at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama was seen as a flashpoint in the company’s relations with its workers. Bezos acknowledged there was room to improve in his last annual letter as CEO. ', 'Still, Bezos’ approach to steering Amazon worked well. With Bezos at the helm, Amazon shook up industry after industry, starting with retail and how books are read, then how data is stored and artificial-intelligence powered devices. ', 'Amazon is now valued at more than $1.7 trillion, making it one of the largest companies in the world by market cap. With more than 1.3 million employees worldwide and hundreds of thousands of workers added annually, Amazon could soon surpass Walmart as the world’s largest employer.', 'Born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and raised in Houston and later Miami, Bezos is known to have been a gifted student with an obsession with “Star Trek” and Sci-Fi books.', 'Space exploration was an early passion. Bezos was inspired to travel to space after watching the Apollo 11 moon landing on his family’s black-and-white television as a five-year-old, according to biographer Stone. Tuesday’s flight was on the 52nd anniversary of the lunar landing. On board the New Shepard capsule were a pair of aviator Amelia Earhart’s goggles and fabric from the original Wright Flyer.', 'When he graduated valedictorian from Miami’s Palmetto High School in 1982, he spoke about his future space ambitions. Some of his ideas served as inspiration for Blue Origin.', 'In an interview with The Miami Herald following his graduation, he telegraphed his grand vision for the future of civilization in space.', '“The whole idea is to preserve the Earth” and turn the planet into a national park, Bezos told the newspaper. ', 'He went on to graduate summa cum laude from Princeton University in 1986 with a degree in computer science and electrical engineering. ', 'After working at a telecom start-up and a financial firm, Bezos joined the then 2-year-old hedge fund D.E. Shaw in 1990. He worked his way up to become a senior vice president within just four years.  ', 'While at D.E. Shaw, Bezos met MacKenzie Tuttle, who was a research associate at the firm. The couple married in 1993, less than a year after they had started dating. She told Vogue in a 2013 interview that it was she who pursued Bezos and not the other way around, citing his “fabulous laugh.”', 'In 1994, D.E. Shaw founder David Shaw tasked Bezos with researching new business opportunities in the coming technological wave of the internet. During a brainstorming session, Shaw and Bezos discussed an idea called “the everything store,” described as an online retailer that would serve as a middle man between customers and manufacturers and “sold nearly every type of product, all over the world,” according to biographer Stone.', 'Bezos made a list of 20 product categories that could possibly be sold on the “everything store,” but ultimately decided that books were the most viable option, according to Stone. When D.E. Shaw didn’t immediately latch onto the idea, Bezos told Shaw that he planned to leave and start his own business. ', 'He quit in 1994 and moved across the country to Seattle, where he bought a house in the suburbs and founded the company that would become Amazon out of his garage. The company was very nearly named “Cadabra,” but it sounded too much like “cadaver,” so Bezos chose Amazon. ', 'The website opened for business on July 16, 1995. Its homepage greeted users with the proclamation of being “Earth’s biggest bookstore,” spanning 1 million titles and offering up “consistently low prices.” Traffic shot up shortly after launch when one of the founders of Yahoo offered to feature Amazon on its “What’s Cool” list, according to The Wall Street Journal. ', '“We thought about it some, and we realized it might be like taking a sip from a fire hose, but we decided to go ahead and go for it,” Bezos recalled, according to the Journal. Within the first month of its launch, Amazon had sold books in every state in the U.S. and 45 countries around the world.  ', 'After a successful IPO in 1997 that made Bezos a millionaire, the CEO successfully navigated Amazon through the dot-com bubble. Even as his net worth skyrocketed, Bezos continued to drive a Honda Accord, saying in a CBS “60 Minutes” interview, “This is a perfectly good car.”', 'In 1999, Bezos was named Time magazine’s Person of the Year. His face appeared on the magazine’s cover, surrounded by a computer mouse and packing peanuts, with the tagline, “e-commerce is changing the way the world shops.”', 'It’s easy to forget that Wall Street wasn’t always singing the praises of the so-called flywheel effect of Amazon’s various businesses. Bezos clashed with Wall Street in Amazon’s early years as a public company. He prioritized growth and strategic bets over pressure from investors to turn a quarterly profit. Bezos reminded investors of that philosophy each year in Amazon’s annual letter to shareholders, when he would attach his first letter from 1997, which proclaimed in one section: “It’s All About the Long Term.”', 'Bezos oversaw two innovations that would be critical to Amazon’s future success.', 'In 2005, facing steep competition from eBay, Amazon debuted its Prime membership program. The program offered consumers “all-you-can-eat” free, two-day shipping, for $79 per year. Investors were initially skeptical about the costly membership program, with one analyst commenting at the time, “Demand is there but the way the company is positioning itself right now, it’s deciding to reward its customers before its investors.”', 'Still, Prime quickly raised the bar for retailers all over the world, at a time when four- to six-day shipping was the standard. On Amazon’s website, Bezos wrote that Prime was meant to “take the effort out of ordering.”', '“We expect Amazon Prime to be expensive for Amazon.com in the short term,” Bezos wrote. “In the long term, we hope to earn even more of your business, which will make it good for us too.”', 'Bezos’ idea that Prime would attract more business to Amazon proved prescient. Prime members, which now total more than 200 million worldwide, spend more and shop more often. And Bezos gave them reason to keep subscribing to Prime by adding access to video and music streaming, Whole Foods discounts and other perks. ', 'The launch of Prime also helped to grow Amazon’s burgeoning footprint of warehouses, which it refers to as “fulfillment centers.” Amazon sprawling fulfillment network, married with an armada of planes, trucks and vans, has enabled it to rival shipping carriers UPS, FedEx and the U.S. Postal Service.', 'One year after Prime debuted, Amazon began rolling out cloud-computing services. Amazon had built internal technology infrastructure to handle complex, data-intensive tasks. ', 'The company realized it could offer the same technology to other businesses, allowing them to offload their data storage and compute capacity and rent it all from Amazon. The idea for Amazon Web Services was formulated at an executive retreat at Bezos’ house in 2003, according to TechCrunch.', 'Since then, AWS has cemented itself as the main profit engine for its parent company. It remains the market leader in cloud-computing services, but competitors Microsoft, Alibaba and Google have caught up in recent years.', 'As Bezos transformed Amazon into a corporate giant, he largely maintained an air of mystery, keeping his personal life tightly guarded. But in 2019, any semblance of obscurity Bezos had maintained imploded.', 'In January 2019, Bezos announced he and his wife were divorcing after 25 years of marriage. Then, the National Enquirer reported about his affair with Lauren Sanchez, a former TV anchor, including intimate texts and photos.', 'Bezos responded by publishing a Medium essay, titled “No thank you, Mr. Pecker,” detailing how the tabloid led by Donald Trump pal David Pecker threatened to post a “below the belt selfie” and other intimate photos if he didn’t drop claims that the paper’s coverage was politically motivated. Bezos drew connections to National Enquirer owner American Media’s relationships with former President Trump and the Saudi government. American Media said it acted lawfully.', 'Prior to the tabloid scandal, Trump had been steadily escalating his attacks against Bezos and Amazon, accusing it of everything from evading local taxes to taking unfair advantage of the U.S. Postal Service. The feud was spurred by Bezos’ ownership of The Washington Post, which often published reporting and opinion pieces that were critical of the president.', 'The scandal came as Amazon and the rest of “big tech” — Facebook, Apple and Alphabet’s Google — faced a steady drumbeat of antitrust allegations. Last July, Bezos testified via video before lawmakers critical of his company’s growing scope and power. It was his first time before Congress.', 'In his last annual letter as CEO, published in April, Bezos signaled he was reckoning with a major criticism of his company. Amazon could no longer just focus on customers at the expense of its workforce. It had to heed calls to make the company a better place to work and create value for workers. In July, Bezos codified those ideas in the company’s list of corporate values.', 'Bezos promised that Amazon could achieve the goal of being the world’s best employer, while being its most consumer-centric company.', '“If any shareowners are concerned that Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work might dilute our focus on Earth’s Most Customer-Centric Company, let me set your mind at ease,” Bezos wrote. “Think of it this way. If we can operate two businesses as different as consumer ecommerce and AWS, and do both at the highest level, we can certainly do the same with these two vision statements. In fact, I’m confident they will reinforce each other.”', 'As he was building Amazon into one of the most valuable companies in the world, making him the world’s richest person starting in 2017, Bezos kept chasing his childhood dreams of space travel in the background.', 'Bezos founded Blue Origin in 2000, but the then-fledgling rocket company remained secretive about its plans until he selected the tiny West Texas town of Van Horn to serve as its launch facility. Local ranchers and residents remained skeptical of the billionaire’s plans to move into town.', 'By 2005, Bezos had acquired 165,000 acres of land in Van Horn, known as “Corn Ranch.” At the time, he gave an interview to the local weekly newspaper, the Van Horn Advocate, detailing his goal of sending a spaceship into orbit, launching and landing the craft vertically.', 'Years later, Bezos said one of Blue Origin’s goals was to move high-polluting industries off of Earth -- the same vision he espoused after graduating from high school. Doing so would be critical to the future of the planet, he added.', '“We humans have to go to space if we are going to continue to have a thriving civilization,” Bezos told CBS News in a July 2019 interview. “We have become big as a population, as a species, and this planet is relatively small. We see it in things like climate change and pollution and heavy industry. We are in the process of destroying this planet. And we have sent robotic probes to every planet in the solar system — this is the good one. So, we have to preserve this planet.”', 'Bezos signaled his deepening commitment to Blue Origin in 2017, when he announced he would sell $1 billion in Amazon stock annually to invest in the venture. At that point, the billionaire space race was beginning to heat up, with fellow billionaires Richard Branson and SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk also vying to go to space.', 'In 2019, Bezos unveiled Blue Origin’s first lunar lander. Called “Blue Moon,” the spacecraft is designed to deliver cargo and astronauts to the moon’s surface by 2024.', 'But going to the moon is just the beginning of Bezos’ vision. Bezos foresees free-floating colonies in space that are capable of supporting 1 trillion people.', '“I don’t think we’ll live on planets, by the way. I think we’ll live in giant O’Neill-style space colonies. Gerard O’Neill, decades ago, came up with this idea,” Bezos said in a 2019 speech at the Yale Club in New York City, referring to the work of the physicist. “The space colonies we’ll build will have many advantages. The primary one is that they’ll be close to Earth.”', 'While it may be some time before humans move into utopian space colonies, Bezos on Tuesday fulfilled one of Blue Origin’s major milestones by completing its first successful passenger spaceflight.', 'In an interview with CNBC’s Morgan Brennan after returning to the planet, Bezos said the flight was “a tiny little step” in Blue Origin’s broader plan. Blue Origin is also developing a reusable rocket called New Glenn that’s built for orbital space travel, Bezos said.', '“Really though we need to build the infrastructure. When Amazon started, we didn’t have to build a package delivery network. It already existed,” Bezos said. “If you want to be a space entrepreneur today, you have to do everything from the very beginning. There’s no real infrastructure that’s at an affordable cost.”', 'Relieved from the day-to-day duties of running Amazon, Bezos can now focus more of his attention on Blue Origin.', '“Since I stepped down as the CEO of Amazon, I have a lot of time to dedicate to this vision,” he said.']"

Without the pipeline, the supply of  oil has so far exceeded the oil companies’ capacity to ship it  out of land-locked Alberta to its largest market -- the  U.S.', '  The glut has driven down prices, making development in the region  less attractive. A pipeline would not only make shipping faster  and easier, it would lower the cost of transport, making the  product still more attractive to customers.', '  “Industry plans to triple tar sands production over the next 20  years, and they simply will not be able to do it without pipeline  capacity,” said Anthony Swift, an attorney with the National  Resources Defense Council, a vocal opponent of the project.  “We’re seeing projects begin to get canceled as it becomes  apparent that pipelines aren’t coming in as quickly as industry  expected.”', '  But even without the pipeline, and with the canceled projects,  production is rising.

CEO Elon Musk expects this “Starlink” service to eventually generate $30 billion per year.', 'In space, construction is advancing smoothly. SpaceX has already become the world’s largest satellite operator, managing more than 500 satellites and counting. That’s a fraction of the thousands it intends to launch, but enough for the system to reach Air Force cockpits and connect Musk to Twitter. The company intends to start beta testing in North America this summer.', 'On the ground, however, SpaceX still has work to do. It has yet to unveil hardware to connect a customer’s home to the satellites flying overhead. The company will also need a network of ground stations linking its satellites to the internet’s physical backbone. Building these nodes is hardly rocket science: indeed 26 are already planned for the U.S. But without a crucial satellite upgrade, those stations will keep the network’s coverage stuck largely to the land.', '“It’s very much not initially a global service,” says Tim Farrar, the president of TMF Associates, a satellite and telecom research firm, “even though the satellites are flying all over the place.”', 'Efforts to beam data down from the skies have typically fallen into two categories: the very near and the very far. Google parent company Alphabet is deploying internet balloons about 12 miles above the ground in Kenya, for instance, and Facebook has its eye on solar-powered drones. These near-surface approaches are speedy, but each floating antenna has a limited geographic footprint.', 'In contrast, companies like the Canadian communications firm Telesat have long operated handfuls of satellites in high orbits more than 20,000 miles above Earth’s surface, where each machine can reach a wide swath of the planet. These systems offer global coverage, but snail-like connections, with round trip signals taking more than half a second. “That doesn’t sound like a big deal, but a typical web page might have 100 round trips,” says Telesat vice president Erwin Hudson. “It adds up.”', 'With Starlink, SpaceX joins a fray of companies, including Telesat, all racing to deliver the best of both worlds: “constellations” of satellites close enough to communicate with the ground in tens of milliseconds, but far enough to cover the planet with a reasonable number of satellites. To complete the service, however, SpaceX needs two more pieces of ground-based infrastructure.', 'Starlink’s major terrestrial hurdle, Musk acknowledges, is the antenna that will get users online — the internet analog of the TV parabolic dish. Starlink’s low-flying satellites zoom across the sky in about five minutes, and antennas will need to keep up. SpaceX’s design has to balance technological sophistication with mass-market affordability.', 'The company plans to use “phased array antennas,” which can direct the machine’s focus electronically rather than physically spinning it around. The technique simplifies the device mechanically, but comes at a high price. Farrar estimates that the gadget could cost more than $1,000, although Musk is targeting a price tag of under $300. In March, the FCC authorized SpaceX to distribute one million antennas, and SpaceX board members recently tested the devices (which reportedly resemble “UFOs on a stick”), but the company has not yet announced the retail version. ', 'Board member tweet', 'Any satellite service also needs a network of ground stations to tap into existing fiber optic infrastructure. These are the points where the space network fuses with the world wide web. “What goes up must come down,” Hudson said.', 'SpaceX is preparing these “gateway” stations, too. The company has registered 26 locations with the FCC, each of which can host eight antennas. Some are SpaceX-owned properties while others belong to telecommunications companies, such as Level Three Communications, which can presumably supply high-speed hookups. Handfuls of mushroom-shaped domes — radar transparent weather protection for antennas — have recently cropped up on some of the lots.', 'These gateways are just the beginning. For maximum performance, Starlink will eventually need thousands of gateway antennas (roughly one per satellite) spread across hundreds of sites worldwide, according to Íñigo del Portillo Barrios, a recent MIT graduate who has analyzed the structure of the Starlink and Telesat constellations.', 'He says Starlink relies heavily on these stations because the current batch of satellites lacks an originally planned feature for the machines to communicate with their neighbors via lasers. This “crosslinking” ability would let Starlink pass a signal to any user below any satellite — even those in the air, on remote islands, or in conflict zones. But without it, a satellite must be able to link a user with a gateway antenna directly, limiting coverage to within roughly 500 miles of each ground station, Farrar estimates.', '“They’ll have big holes in the middle of the oceans and some deserts,” Farrar said. “They’ll need to go to a country’s regulator and say, ‘please let us in, please let us build the gateways in your country.’”', 'That’s hardly a showstopper for reaching most rural areas (currently planned stations will cover most of the U.S. and Mexico). But traditional satellite internet clients such as the military, who might desire access over central Iraq for example, or airlines and shipping companies seeking connectivity in the Atlantic and Pacific, may prefer to wait for a truly global service.', 'SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment on its gateway or crosslinking plans, but Hudson says that even though Telesat has 50 years of satellite experience and plans to start launching crosslink-enabled satellites in 2022, choreographing ground operations will still represent one of their major challenges.', '“We’re building earth stations on every continent except possibly Antarctica,” he said. “You’ve got to ship stuff everywhere. You’ve got to get it built, maintained, and upgraded.”', 'Adding crosslinking will eventually help SpaceX lessen the sway geography has on Starlink’s coverage, and the company intends to start experimenting with interlinked satellites sometime this year, president Gwynne Shotwell has said.', 'But the upgrade won’t be simple, and the second-generation network won’t be operational in the immediate future. First SpaceX needs to overhaul its satellite design to incorporate a beefier power supply, finely tuned lasers, and other hardware. Then it will also have to rebuild and relaunch the entire swarm.', 'The company can pull it off eventually, Farrar said, but first Starlink will have to prove its worth with the satellites it has in the sky, and the gateway stations it can build on the ground.']"

But if humans ever hope to set up long-term habitats on the moon or Mars, their physical and mental health would benefit from the ability to grow plants.', 'Space agencies from various countries have spent decades developing the technologies necessary to bring farming indoors, and now the German space agency and NASA are pushing the state-of-the-art of soil-free gardening to its limits with a greenhouse in Antarctica and laying the groundwork for their next act: farming systems where the farmers are optional.', 'NASA has worked to advance space agriculture, in part because a robust plant collection could serve as the ultimate multipurpose life-support system, producing calories and nutrients to eat, making oxygen to breathe and taking carbon dioxide from the air.', 'Building on Soviet research, NASA funded a variety of agricultural programs in the 1980s and 1990s. In a collaboration with the University of Wisconsin, researchers discovered that they could replace hot and cumbersome incandescent grow lights with a particular blend of LED lights. Red LEDs, which were more energy efficient, let plants photosynthesize. But plants also needed blue light, or they would grow too tall and spindly. The work led to a patent, and today’s indoor farms often feed plants on a similar diet of red and blue photons — which is why indoor farms often appear bathed in purple light.', '“NASA was genuinely in front of the curve on this, promoting their use for these applications,” says Raymond Wheeler, a horticultural scientist who has studied space agriculture at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for decades.', 'In the late 1980s, Wheeler worked on a KSC team that grew wheat, potatoes, soybeans and other crops with their roots immersed in a nutrient solution, stacked on four rows of shelves inside a large cylindrical chamber — likely the first execution of a vertical farming system that has now developed into a multi-billion-dollar industry.', 'Focusing on ways to sustainably meet the ever-growing demand for food, companies around indoor vertical farming has seen a boom in recent years. New York-based start-up Bowery Farming announced a $300 million funding round in June, the largest in the industry thus far, valuing the company at $2.3 billion. Kimbal Musk, brother of Elon Musk, is the co-founder of Square Roots.

It builds upon the LED blend pioneered by the early NASA experiments to deliver “recipes” tuned to the needs of each specific vegetable with programmable arrays of red and blue lights.', 'Roots poke through beds of fibrous minerals and dangle into empty trays below, where automated nozzles spray them with a nutrient-rich mist every few seconds. Water is largely recycled, except when the nutrient solution gets depleted and needs to be dumped and replaced every few months. The entire system plugs into the neighboring German Neumeyer III research station, from which it continuously draws about 10 kilowatts of power — comparable to eight U.S. households.', 'The first year, a DLR researcher named Paul Zabel ran the 135-square-foot greenhouse and collected nearly 600 pounds of veggies including cucumbers, lettuces, other leafy greens, tomatoes, radishes and herbs.', 'But despite the greenhouse’s automated lighting, watering, and fertilizing systems, Zabel still spent three to four hours a day just keeping EDEN-ISS functioning, Schubert says.

Topping the list of lessons learned from EDEN-ISS is that future facilities need to be simpler. “We will definitely scale down the technology complexity for a space greenhouse,” Schubert says.', 'Next in the pipeline, DLR is currently designing a new facility — a semi-inflatable, space-rated cylinder — with a few new tricks.', 'One improvement will be advanced remote monitoring. Anna-Lisa Paul and her colleagues at the UF Space Plants Lab are developing software that can take GoPro images and recognize how a plant’s appearance changes with stress. When a plant needs water or has been exposed to too much salt, the colors of light it absorbs and reflects shift subtly in ways imperceptible to the human eye. But the lab’s system can spot salt stress in just fifteen minutes, and drought stress in about an hour, according to Natasha Sng, a researcher at the Space Plants Lab, much earlier than a human can.', 'The researchers have been testing their system at EDEN-ISS, but the greenhouse has been running too smoothly to know how well the monitoring system works. “We’ve been watching a lot of success happen,” says Robert Ferl, co-director of the Space Plants Lab.', 'Soon, the researchers plan to introduce intentional malfunctions and see if the lab’s system can catch them.', 'In another major step toward automation, the DLR is developing robotic arms to be mounted on a rail suspended from the greenhouse roof. These dexterous machines, powered by AI, would photograph the plants from various angles, prune dead leaves and shoots, and even harvest produce, which Schubert estimates are the most time-consuming activities after repairs.', 'The end goal is a greenhouse that, if not completely autonomous, could at least be run fully by operators on Earth. Such a facility could touch down on the moon or Mars ahead of astronauts and have a basket of cucumbers and tomatoes ready for their arrival. Astronauts would have the option of gardening, which can bolster mental health, but the crops should be able to thrive on their own when astronauts have more pressing tasks.', 'The DLR’s roadmap aims to have their next-generation facility ready to fly by 2030. “I still need to send [Elon] Musk an email and ask if we can design his greenhouse,” Schubert said.', 'And developing the ability to farm in space isn’t purely about going to Mars. A two-way street has always connected space agriculture with industrial agriculture. As climate change makes many areas of the globe less suitable for farming, the technology to split food production from weather and natural resources will likely become more essential.', '“My dream would be that we all live in ecological biospheres on our own,” Schubert says. “We would be completely independent from the planet Earth, and we would leave Earth to its own so it can recover.”']"

55,What Warren Buffett’s losing battle against S&P 500 says about this market,2021-01-08T14:46:17+0000,"['Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway made some big purchases in 2020, but the biggest Buffett buy speaks to the big challenge the company will continue to face: there was nothing it could find at a better price than its own shares.', 'Berkshire bought back more than $18 billion in its own shares last year, through October, almost twice as much as Buffett spent on his next biggest acquisition, the $10 billion natural gas assets transaction with Dominion Energy, which including the debt acquired, was the largest acquisition since 2016. Taken at his word — which he has earned — that he won’t do a share repurchase just to prop up the stock, the big buyback was a signal from Buffett that he thinks the stock is undervalued.', '“If he had acquired a portfolio company for $18 billion or purchased $18 billion in the stock of a public company, we would call it significant,” said James Shanahan, Edward Jones analyst, who estimated the buybacks through Oct. at $18.4 billion and maintains a positive outlook on Berkshire shares.', '“Few better places for Berkshire to allocate its capital than to investing in itself with share buybacks,” says Lawrence Cunningham, author of several books about Warren Buffett and Berkshire, and a professor at George Washington University. “Price was right. Disclosure was clear. Pure investment rationality.”', 'Even if Buffett is making the right call on the buybacks, the size of it being bigger than any M&A acquisition since 2016′s deal for Precision Castparts highlights a reason Berkshire has struggled to keep up with the broader market in recent years: investors don’t see Buffett being able to make the bold bets that made his name and so many Berkshire shareholders’ fortunes.', 'Over the past two decades, Buffett has done reasonably well against the index, actually beating the S&P 500 in 12 calendar years between 1999 and 2020. Though years in which Berkshire has trailed have included some big margins and resulted in the company lagging the index over the past 5-, 10- and 15-year periods, according to data from S&P Global.', 'In 2020, Berkshire Hathaway shares were up, but not by much (2%), against an S&P 500 that gained over 18%, with dividends reinvested, according to S&P Global. Taken together, the two-year stretch of 2019 and 2020 marked one of the biggest gaps between Berkshire and the broader U.S. stock market in recent history, with the Buffett trailing the index return by a combined 37%.', 'At least in the short-term, investor sentiment is against the company because market forces are working against him. The market Buffett faces is defined by record low interest rates — which the Fed has signalled will remain the norm for some time — making more cheap debt available to fund acquisitions from competitors, such as private equity, that don’t now need the cash reserves of a Berkshire. As a result, asset prices across the market are elevated.', '“No one is contesting his multi-decade track record, the intelligent use of cheap flows to build tremendous value over time. He has done that repeatedly, but now capital is cheap for everyone,” says Meyer Shields, a KBW analyst. “It diminishes his advantage. It was an element of the secret sauce, but maybe the best of bad choices is to not buy anything.”', 'Shields, who has covered Berkshire Hathaway for a long time, often critically, and has had the distinction of being excluded from analyst invitations to the company’s annual meetings, says Buffett can be right about not overpaying and still be punished by investors for that decision. “It mostly comes down to valuation for acquisition opportunities and barring some crash, I don’t see tremendous opportunities for acquisitions going forward. We are stuck with the idea that they have a ton of capital, but so does everyone.”', 'Between the pandemic onset and through the May virtual annual meeting — where Charlie Munger was notably replaced by Berkshire Hathaway Energy head Greg Abel as Buffett’s counterpart, which will be the case again this year as speculation centers on Abel as the first post-Buffett CEO — frustration with the pace of investment activity grew. Buffett was uncharacteristically fearful when others were fearful, too.', '“It was fair for them to be concerned about the implications of the pandemic. But people were nervous because they didn’t see opportunities ... and they didn’t see attractive stocks to buy, and weren’t even buying back their own stock, just hoarding cash and people worried about what he would do with it,” Shanahan said.', 'In March, no one had a handle on what mortality rates from the pandemic would be, or how the government would act, and Berkshire’s long-term history shows that Buffett holds cash during periods of risk. “There might have been some disappointment, but he was being consistent,” Shields said, even when it came to not rushing to buy back Berkshire shares.', 'The distressed investments Buffett was able to make in the last financial crisis of 2008, meanwhile, were not repeatable during the pandemic, as the government acted rapidly to stimulate the economy and support devastated industries.', '“This time around government support was swift, rolled out so much faster than in 2008,” Shanahan said.', 'The one investment that ultimately helped to boost investors confidence starting in the summer was the increased buyback activity being disclosed. “They got aggressive with the buybacks from June through October. There is not as much competition to buy back his own stock,” Shanahan said.', 'Cunningham expects more of the same: “Added bonus: get rid of the short-term Berkshire shareholders, such as Bill Ackman, in favor of the true believers. ... expect continued repetition.”', 'The $145 billion last reported in cash by Berkshire does need to move to keep the stock moving higher.', '“The worst thing that can happen is they aren’t deploying capital. I would like to see much more cash put to work. It is a huge driver of earnings and market cap,” said Shanahan. “But there are very few acquisitions over $20 billion. ... Capital deployment in excess of cash generation will drive the stock and the easiest way to accomplish that is buybacks.”', 'Precision Castparts, in 2016, was a $37 billion deal.', 'In recent years Buffett has made clear that assets are so pricey, his preference is to focus on buying more stocks of public companies. But that had the unintended consequence of making some of his smaller missteps with those public stock holdings more notable in 2020.', 'Berkshire sold the big stake it had recently built in airline stocks including American, Delta, United and Southwest, early in Q2 2020, possibly near trough valuations. And through the end of the second quarter, Berkshire was a net seller of stocks. Its reduced holdings of financial stocks, including investments in Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, PNC, M&T Bank and Bank of NY Mellon — which in the broader scheme of things should attract more investors as the public stock portfolio tilts more to tech and consumer trends — did include some questionable timing decisions.', '“The airline stocks was messy,. He certainly sold at a bad time and was liquidating bank stocks at cheap valuations. JP Morgan has rallied a lot,” said Shanahan. “Those were timing mistakes. With the airlines it was the right thing to do, but the wrong time to do it.”', 'Buffett has been loading up on Bank of America as his No. 1 bank stock for the future. “Bank of America has been a homerun,” Shanahan said of the investment agreement first reached in 2011 when Berkshire bought $5 billion in bank preferred shares and the right to 700 million in common shares over a decade at a price of roughly $7 per share, which currently trades above $30.', '“Getting rid of some of the financials was my biggest frustration,” said Greg Womack, president of Womack Investment Advisers, which has held Berkshire as a core portfolio stock across many client accounts. “The timing hasn’t always been the best ... but I don’t think they look so much at the technicals.”', 'With more of the investment decision-making being in the hands of hedge fund managers brought in-house years ago,Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, the timing decisions could change more in the future, analysts and investors say. The recent past has seen a significant shift in the stock portfolio managed by Berkshire.', 'At the end of 2018, the portfolio was still “handcuffed by financials,” Shanahan said.', 'Even with Apple as its largest stock holding — which has proved to be a great investment in tech by Buffett after his IBM stumble and has grown so much Berkshire was led to trim the position last year — Berkshire’s internal managers who have discretion to buy in the billions of dollars have been underweight technology, and that is one reason it has trailed the S&P 500.', '“These portfolio managers charged with trying to outperform the market didn’t own stocks in the sector that was the strongest performing,” Shanahan said. “Financials like Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank sort of set them up to underperform into 2019 and 2020. It is a hard thing to do, hard to beat the market, when you have large percentages in value stocks. They took action.”', 'Since the end of 2018, Berkshire’s stock portfolio exposure to financials has fallen from 49% to 28%, while tech has swelled, primarily due to Apple. Technology and consumer stocks are now close to 50% of the public company holdings. Stocks that have appeared in recent years include Amazon, T-Mobile and, in the most recent quarter, a handful of health-care stocks.', '“Tech, communication services, health care. It is starting to have more of a new economy feel and look more like the market,” Shanahan said. In the Sept. 2020 quarter alone, Berkshire disclosed $7 billion in new positions in tech, communications and health care sectors. Health-care stock Davita is a major Berkshire holding, but the company has not historically invested much in health care sector relative to other sectors.', 'The most surprising new portfolio direction was Berkshire’s first-ever U.S. IPO investment, Snowflake, which turned out to be the biggest tech software IPO in history.', '“Tech investments Buffett didn’t used to think he understood. The industry is easier to understand now, and unavoidable,” Cunningham said. “But those companies [Apple, Snowflake] are still very much Berkshire kinds of companies, led by long-term strategic thinkers who want to have high quality shareholders.”', 'Snowflake may have been in investment led by Todd Combs, who Shanahan noted has signed the paperwork on the deal and was also behind Berkshire Hathaway’s investment in Brazilian credit-card-processing company Stoneco, which was made just days after the IPO in late 2018.', 'A very Buffett-like deal in support of Scripps’ acquisition of ION Media, was led by the other manager Ted Weschler, through which Berkshire invested $600 million in preferred stock (8% dividend if paid in cash, 9% if deferred).', 'With prices high in the U.S. market, Berkshire bought slightly more than 5% stakes in Japanese conglomerates Itochu, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Sumitomo & Marubeni, driven by frustration with the lack of opportunities in the U.S., according to Shanahan. And Berkshire issued yen-denominated bonds at an all-in cost of about 1% to finance the transaction. “Highly unusual, though. Berkshire hasn’t made a lot of large investments in international stocks in the past,” he said, adding that the transactions can be increased to near-10%.', 'Buffett also ended his remaining ownership within the newspaper business in 2020 and while not surprising, it was notable in light of Buffett’s longer history of never selling companies he acquires, and could also be a signal to the next era of Berkshire management post-Buffett that some philosophies are allowed to change.', '“They are doing IPOs and selling operating companies, which they wouldn’t do in the past, and making investments in international stocks, and willing to buy back shares at an accelerated pace. Quite a bit has changed,” Shanahan said.', 'For first time, Berkshire also invested in gold — a commodity Buffett has long criticized — though it bought gold mining stock Barrick Gold rather than the metal directly. Nevertheless, the market saw the move as a significant reversal as gold miners are levered to the underlying price of the metal.', '“It looks like they are building a little bit of a hedge there,” says Womack. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they add to that position.”', 'The big changes to the stock portfolio may hold one more big surprise in 2021. Berkshire recently disclosed that confidential information had been omitted from its 13F report, which details the latest stock buying and selling. In the past, this has meant that Berkshire was building a large position in a public company and wanted regulatory permission to complete their purchases prior to making the information public.', 'Shanahan noted that the value of the equity portfolio was $245 billion as of Sept. 30, 2020, excluding Kraft Heinz, and he could only account for roughly $220 billion. Some of that difference could be related to more shares in the Japanese trading firms being purchased, but this is a strategy Berkshire has used in the past when building a big position in a company, such as IBM, and there are other options even in a pricey U.S. market, such as in the depressed energy sector, though Berkshire has been a seller of some energy stocks in recent history.', 'Berkshire’s existing operating companies have potential in the near-term without a major new position. Berkshire Energy, in particular, should have faster growth than many other subsidiaries as electricity demand grows, and many of the other wholly owned businesses negatively influenced by Covid, from reduced shipping to higher insurance claims and restaurant shutdowns and retail store closures, hurting Brooks and other retail brands under the Berkshire umbrella, could see improved earnings in 2021, even though Shanahan said he thought insurer Geico and railroad Burlington Northern held up well in 2020.', 'Buffett may yet get his opportunity to make some major moves with his company’s cash. “We will still see a lot of companies in financial trouble over the next few years when they go to refinance debt and they are already over-leveraged. Cash is still king and he knows it,” Womack said. ” We will see many more companies becoming even more attractive and I think that’s why Buffett is biding his time. The smart money is allowed to be cash heavy.”', 'Timing, of another kind, is an issue with investors today, especially newer ones, Womack said, and that has repercussions for the idea of an investment in Berkshire. “There are so many options for investors today for growth and tactical management and staying exposed to the upside .... and we are in tactical environment. Investors want to be tactical rather than more passive, so maybe a new investor won’t sit on a BRK like they used to.”', 'In 1999, the performance gap between Berkshire and the S&P 500 reached close to 40%, but in hindsight, that was a buy signal. After 1999, Berkshire had one of its best stretches in recent history against the S&P 500, gaining approximately 30% during a period of years when the index was down by close to 40%.', '“Back to 2000, it beats the S&P by a lot,” Womack said. “If the S&P goes down substantially, Berkshire could do better.”', 'Barron’s noted in a recent investment call on Berkshire, “It has paid to buy Berkshire after prior periods of underperformance.”', 'That was a bet at least one big investor made in 2020: Warren Buffett.']"
56,"Michael Flynn, Russia and a grand scheme to build nuclear power plants in Saudi Arabia and the Arab world",2017-06-09T22:05:15+0000,"['By the time Michael Flynn was fired as President Donald Trump’s national security adviser in February, he had made a lot of bad decisions. One was taking money from the Russians (and failing to disclose it); another was taking money under the table from the Turks. But an overlooked line in his financial disclosure form, which he was forced to amend to detail those foreign payments, reveals he was also involved in one of the most audacious—and some say harebrained—schemes in recent memory: a plan to build scores of U.S. nuclear power plants in the Middle East. As a safety measure.', 'In 2015 and 2016, according to his filing, Flynn was an adviser to X-Co Dynamics Inc./Iron Bridge Group, which at first glance looks like just another Pentagon consultancy that ex-military officers use to fatten their wallets. Its chairman and CEO was retired Admiral Michael Hewitt; another retired admiral, Frank “Skip” Bowman, who oversaw the Navy’s nuclear programs, was an adviser. Other top guns associated with it were former National Security Agency boss Keith Alexander and retired Marine Corps General James “Hoss” Cartwright, former vice chief of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, whose stellar career was marred when he was prosecuted last year for lying to the FBI during a leak investigation.', 'In the summer of 2015, knowledgeable sources tell Newsweek, Flynn flew to Egypt and Israel on behalf of X-Co/Iron Bridge. His mission: to gauge attitudes in Cairo and Jerusalem toward a fantastical plan for a joint U.S.-Russian (and Saudi-financed) program to get control over the Arab world’s rush to acquire nuclear power. At the core of their concern was a fear that states in the volatile Middle East would have inadequate security for the plants and safeguards for their radioactive waste—the stuff of nuclear bombs.', 'More from Newsweek: How Big Data mines personal info to craft fake news and manipulate votersWhat will happen to Trump?‘Infrastructure week’ symbol of Trump’s many problems', 'But no less a concern for Flynn and his partners was the moribund U.S. nuclear industry, which was losing out to Russian and even South Korean contractors in the region. Or as Stuart Solomon, a top executive along with Hewitt at his new venture, IP3 (International Peace, Power and Prosperity), put it in a recent speech to industry executives, “We find ourselves…standing on the sidelines and watching the competition pass us by.”', 'That the oil-rich, sun-soaked Arab Middle East would pursue nuclear energy seems paradoxical. But as The Economist noted in 2015, “Demand for electricity is rising, along with pressure to lower carbon emissions; nuclear plants tick both boxes.” And some of the region’s major players, like Egypt and Jordan, don’t have oil and gas resources and “want nuclear power to shore up the security of their energy supplies,” The Economist said.', 'So the genius idea developed by Flynn and Co. was a U.S.-Russian partnership to build and operate plants and export the dangerous spent fuel under strict controls. Flynn’s role would be helping X-Co/Iron Bridge design and implement a vast security network for the entire enterprise, according to an internal memo by ACU Strategic Partners, one of the lead companies involved, obtained by Newsweek.', 'Not only would the project revive the U.S. nuclear industry, but it would cost American taxpayers nothing, its principals asserted. It would be “funded entirely by Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries,” according to the ACU memo. The kingdom’s upfront cost? “Close to a trillion dollars,” says a project insider, who asked for anonymity in exchange for discussing internal matters. Theoretically, the Saudis would recoup their costs by selling energy to Egypt, Jordan, Yemen and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) members Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar—which hosts the largest U.S. military base in the region. (Qatar doesn’t seem to be an option for the moment, since six of the Arab states, led by the Saudis, severed diplomatic relations with it on June 5 over its alleged support of terrorism.)', 'Left out of this grand nuclear scheme: Iran (along with Syria, its war-ravaged Shiite proxy). In fact, “it was always part of the project that Russia’s involvement...would tilt Russia away from Iran,” Fred Johnson, ACU’s chief economist, wrote in an email to his advisers obtained by Newsweek. Not only would Russia earn cash for being a dumping ground for radioactive waste, Johnson wrote, but the consortium would purchase “Russian military hardware” to compensate Moscow for losing military sales to Iran.', '“Further plans to sideline Iran,” Johnson wrote, included “the development of X-Co,” the Hewitt company that Flynn was advising, “with its very visible deployment of Sea Launch,” a Russian company “that would provide a platform for rockets.”', 'It’s unclear whether Flynn was involved in negotiating with Sea Launch. The former general, now being pursued by federal investigators probing contacts between Russian officials and Trump’s inner circle, did not respond to an inquiry from Newsweek. People associated with the Middle East project say they thought Flynn’s involvement was limited to sounding out the Egyptians and Israelis on security aspects of the enterprise. He listed no income from X-Co/Iron Bridge on his financial disclosure form and “was not paid,” except for his travel expenses, according to Thomas Cochran, a prominent scientist and nuclear nonproliferation proponent involved with the project. (The cost of business-class round-trip airfare and exclusive hotels for the trip would have ranged between $10,000 and $15,000.)', 'Hewitt denied that isolating Iran was part of the plan. “X-Co wasn’t created to simply ‘sideline Iran,’” he responded to Johnson and their associates in an email. “It was designed to set the conditions for stability which were the precursors to building 40 plants” and to “solidify the GCC, Jordan, Egypt under a security construct, led by two superpowers, using state of the art capability.”', 'But the project faced opposition from the Obama administration, Cochran says. “They didn’t want to do it with the Russians and didn’t want to do it while they were negotiating the Iran deal,” he tells Newsweek.', 'Trump’s embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin, on the other hand, offered an attractive possibility. And when Flynn, who had connections to the Russians, became the candidate’s national security adviser, the ACU team, led by British-American dealmaker Alex Copson, suddenly seemed to have an inside man. Last year, Copson was touting such connections when he tried to buy an unfinished nuclear plant in Alabama in concert with the Russians, telling a Huntsville reporter that “Alabama’s two senators”—both Republicans, and one, Jeff Sessions, then a top Trump campaign adviser—“can help the next administration move this project forward.” Copson’s bid for the plant failed.', 'When reports surfaced that the FBI was investigating possible collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign, however, some of Copson’s partners and advisers decided it was time to walk away. “When Copson decided he was going to saddle up with the Trump team, that was the last straw for me,” the insider says. “I said it’s time to regroup.”', 'The Saudis hadn’t shown much interest anyway, the insider says. “Copson was promising the advisers lots of money if the Saudis put up money,” but it failed to materialize. “And so there’s nothing that anyone was going to gain unless the project was a success,” he tells Newsweek.', 'Hewitt and his associates also split from ACU to pursue their own path toward a nuclear-powered Middle East, one that would swap in China for Russia as a nuclear partner, two sources close to the project say. (Hewitt declined to discuss plans for IP3, telling Newsweek he was “working hard to create our public persona right now.”)', 'But the highly regarded Cochran stayed with ACU. A longtime senior scientist and onetime president at the Natural Resources Defense Council, he was the author of countless studies and articles over the decades and had initiated with Moscow the U.S.-Soviet nuclear test ban verification project in 1986. He “has extraordinary chutzpah,” a writer for Scientific American observed in 1998. “He is willing to take on what most people wouldn’t bother with because they assume it’s hopeless.”', 'Or nuts. In 2001, a writer for the left-wing In These Times weekly got hold of a draft proposal for a 1990s-era project that Cochran was involved in, the Nuclear Proliferation Trust, which envisioned taking control of spent fuel from reactors around the world and shipping it to Russia “on large ships mounted with an arsenal of weapons designed to ward off nuclear pirates,” wrote Jeffrey St. Clair. “The big question is what happens to the waste after it arrives in Russia.” Would NPT guards be authorized to fire on rogue Russian soldiers or Chechen rebels? And what would stop corrupt Russians from selling weapons-grade uranium to anyone who could pony up the cash?', 'Similar concerns are all the more reason to partner with the Russians today in an ironclad security arrangement, Hewitt says. “We’re always going to be engaged in the security of the Middle East,” he told a May gathering at the Nuclear Energy Institute. “It is in our best interests to ensure that nuclear power is introduced with all of the safety [standards of the U.S.].”', 'Cochran urges critics not to lose focus on the big picture, which he alternately likens to launching the U.S. Marshall Plan, which rebuilt Europe after World War II, and the Tennessee Valley Authority, which tamed rivers and brought electricity and industrial development to the American South in the 1930s. “It would provide energy and jobs and so forth for countries like Egypt and others in the region,” he says, “so that these young men have got something more useful to do than go out and shoot each other.”', 'For a project fraught with such diplomatic and logistical minefields, however, Copson is an odd choice to lead ACU into the Middle East. “A sometime bass player with the British rock band Iron Butterfly,” according to Time, Copson once famously “described the natives of the Marshall Islands as ‘fat, lazy fucks’ when they nixed one of his nuke dump schemes” in the Central Pacific Ocean, the muckraking journalist Greg Palast wrote in 2001. (The islands are now disappearing under rising seas.)', 'Copson did not respond to several calls and emails asking for comment. But it’s not likely the Trump team, many of whom are under close scrutiny for their undisclosed Russian contacts, will be any help to Copson now. And the Saudis aren’t “taking the kind of steps that would be required to really get serious about setting up a civil nuclear-energy infrastructure,” says Tristan Volpe, a fellow in the Nuclear Policy Program of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C.', 'Others suspect the Saudis are up to something more nefarious because of the U.S.-led nuclear deal with Iran. The Saudis “have big ambitions for nuclear,” says David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, D.C. “The issue is whether they cross over into any processing or enrichment” with secret partners like Pakistan or China, he says.', 'Flynn once expressed deep worries about a Saudi-Iranian nuclear arms race. In a January 2016 interview with Al-Jazeera, he sounded like Cochran, the elder statesman of the nonproliferation movement. “An entirely new economy is what this region needs,” he said, especially for the millions of unemployed young men living under corrupt autocracies and tempted by extremism. “You’ve got to give them something else to do. If you don’t, they’re going to turn on their own governments.”', 'But that was before he hitched up with Trump, who has embraced the Saudi monarchy and ratcheted up his rhetoric against Iran. Talk of a grand scheme to create jobs in the Middle East, meanwhile, has evaporated, with the Russia scandal enveloping not only Flynn but Trump’s entire presidency.', 'Watch: Flynn misled investigators', 'This piece originally appeared on Newsweek.']"

But a high volume of rework and design tweaks could cut into Tesla’s margins and contribute to delays in the delivery of its cars.', 'Tesla said such work is being done on a small subset of parts from suppliers and has not constrained or delayed its Model 3 build plan. ', 'Tesla’s future as a mass-market car company hinges on efficient, automated production of the Model 3. The Model 3 is currently the best-selling electric car in the U.S. So far more than 400,000 people have already reserved that vehicle, paying $1,000 refundable fees to do so.', 'In January, Tesla projected it would make 2,500 Model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter of 2018. On April 3, in a Vehicle Production and Deliveries report, Tesla revealed it had missed that quarterly target. ', 'All automakers have to deal with some amount of defective or damaged parts, both from their own factories and from suppliers. But, as previously reported, current and former employees say that Tesla experiences a higher rate of defects than industry norms. A significant number of flawed parts and parts in need of design changes also come from Tesla’s suppliers, they said.', 'Current and former employees from the company’s Fremont, California, and Sparks, Nevada, factories blame Tesla for spending less time to vet suppliers than is typical in auto manufacturing. These people said the company failed to perform comprehensive statistical variance testing — used by car makers to estimate the percentage of parts that will fail to meet product specifications — with some vendors before embarking on Model 3 production.', 'Tesla told CNBC it has a rigorous supplier collaboration process that includes on-site audits, manufacturing capability reviews and other common process controls to predict and eliminate quality issues. It also recently expressed appreciation of its suppliers in its first-quarter vehicle deliveries release.', 'Evidence of Tesla’s rework burden stands in plain view in San Jose, California, less than a half-hour drive from the company’s main factory in Fremont. Towering racks and stacks of boxes emblazoned with Tesla’s name stood in the lot beside a sheet metal and machine shop called JL Precision earlier this month.', 'Current and former Tesla engineers explained that some of the flawed parts made by the company’s suppliers will go to JL Precision and other local shops, including paint shops, for quality evaluation or rework. These people declined to be identified because they were not authorized to talk to the press. ', 'Tesla said it uses JL Precision to add an unspecified coating to some parts.', 'Labels on the boxes and on racks at JL Precision indicated they contained parts and tooling used to make the Model S, Model X and most of all, the newest Model 3 vehicles. Parts awaiting rework and design tweaks included door frames, doublers, torque boxes, nodes and shock mounts.', 'Vendors supplying these parts to Tesla included a manufacturing equipment producer, Hongbang Die Casting; Ningbo Tuopu Group, an auto-parts maker that’s publicly traded on the Shanghai stock exchange; and Shiloh Industries, an Ohio company that makes lightweight car parts and materials. JL Precision and these suppliers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.', 'There were also racks of castings, used to make tooling for Tesla’s own manufacturing operation.', 'Once the “non-conforming” parts are analyzed and fixed, they can be used either for spare parts or in final vehicle assembly. Outsourcing some rework allows Tesla to avoid wasting materials they’ve paid for already and frees up space in its Fremont factory, where all of its electric vehicles are now produced.', 'Auto-manufacturing expert Steve Finch, a former GM plant manager with about 40 years of industry experience, said automakers typically deal with some flawed parts from suppliers.', 'Finch said mass-market car companies normally will take a year or more to vet a prospective supplier. This is to ensure the supplier’s factory follows ISO quality management standards and other processes that are on par with the automaker’s own.', 'Former and current employees said Tesla took less time before signing on new suppliers. Tesla employees tasked with vetting suppliers were also not always experienced with ISO quality management standards, said these people.', 'Finch said outsourcing some rework to outside suppliers is “not an unreasonable thing,” however, automakers “will want to avoid having to make decisions that are hugely expensive or could delay production.”', 'He added automakers usually try to make sure their parts suppliers “are able to make quality parts not just one time but every time well ahead of the start of vehicle production.”', 'Hanging on to flawed parts from vendors and reworking them locally makes sense when an automaker is constrained by supply or time, Finch said. Sending rework off-site to shops near a factory can help a car company avoid the wait and cost associated with overseas shipping. ', 'Employees attributed outsourcing of rework to the company’s cycles of production. Tesla typically ramps up production at the end of each quarter, with all hands working overtime to make the numbers. Just prior to and after these pushes, more work is outsourced, they said.', 'Musk has publicly acknowledged that the company is fighting hard to perfect mass-market vehicle production but said in April that it’s been in “production hell.”']"

But the partnership represents yet another example of Amazon rivals choosing to go with Microsoft’s cloud offering over the cloud computing market leader Amazon Web Services (AWS).', 'Amazon and FedEx have been increasingly competitive with each other as Amazon invests heavily in building out its own shipping network. FedEx announced last year that it would end its ground delivery contract with Amazon. The e-commerce and tech giant still gives FedEx business thanks to third-party sellers who use it to ship packages. But many think Amazon will eventually ship everything itself without the help of third parties.', 'Microsoft and FedEx’s offering, which will be available later in the year, will collect data through FedEx’s IoT technology and analyze it through Microsoft’s suite of services, and could help predict issues that would slow delivery, such as severe weather or clearance issues.

They’re investing in areas where there are shortages of capability in markets … They have to do what they have to do,” McCullough said.', 'Amazon has made the push into last mile delivery, or the transportation of goods from a delivery hub to the end destination in the supply chain, in a bid to drive profit margins down further. One of these strategies has been the use of drone delivery services, which the internet company successfully pulled off in December.', 'The e-commerce company’s investments in infrastructure might be making delivery more affordable to attract retailers looking for cheaper logistics options, but McCullough appeared unfazed.', '“Free shipping has been around, again, since 1996. I used to run an e-commerce team and … there’s no such thing as free shipping,” McCullough said.', '“It takes money to hire and build these great buildings, (to) make sure that technology and infrastructure is in place. So the question for us is, can we do this every day, worldwide? … Certainly, the notion of free and who’s consuming the cost associated with ‘free’ is going to be an ongoing battle,” he added.', 'Costs will continue to remain a core focus for UPS, as it attempts to drive costs down while improving densities, or the volume of packages per delivery stop made.

So we are looking at waterways, rivers, transportation. That will simplify the operations that we have,” he said.

63,"Russia is dominating the Arctic, but it’s not looking to fight over it",2019-12-27T10:08:26+0000,"['While the world focuses on trade wars and shifting geopolitical dynamics, Russia has been quietly expanding its own political, economic and military influence in a lesser-watched space: the Arctic.', 'Russia certainly feels at home with the Arctic, and vice versa; Russia’s coastline accounts for 53% of Arctic Ocean coastline and the country’s population in the region totals roughly 2 million people — that’s around half of the people living in the Arctic worldwide, according to the Arctic Institute, a center for circumpolar security studies.', 'As such, it’s perhaps no surprise that Russia wants to extend its influence in a region that it feels at home in, and one that offers multiple opportunities in a variety of areas ranging from energy and trade, to defense.', '“Russia is by virtue of its geography, the largest Arctic country. The fact that there are 2 million people that are Russian living there too means that the Arctic is Russia in many ways,” Andreas Østhagen, senior research fellow at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute in Norway, and at the Arctic Institute, told CNBC.', '“In Russia too, the Arctic resonates with people and they have so many of their resources in that region; oil and gas, fisheries and minerals.”', 'It is estimated that there could be trillions of dollars’ worth (as much as $35 trillion) of untapped gas and oil reserves, as well as mineral resources, that Russia and its Arctic neighbors are keen to tap.', 'Østhagen said that Russia can draw on the Arctic for economic purposes and it has for a while been instrumental in investing in grand projects, such as the Yamal LNG project, “one of the largest and most complex LNG (liquefied natural gas) projects in the world,” according to Total, which has a 20% stake in the project based in the Yamal Peninsula above the Arctic Circle. Novatek, Russia’s second-largest natural gas producer, has a 50% stake in the venture.', 'In a bid to encourage energy companies to increase exploration and extraction activities in the Arctic, the Kremlin announced in October a trillion-ruble tax cut, or around $40 billion, to incentivize those activities.', 'The tax cut reportedly came after domestic and international investors said they would only invest in Vostok Oil, an Arctic oil project led by Russia’s largest oil company Rosneft, if the government gave in to demands from Rosneft’s chief executive for preferential tax rates. Vostok Oil is expected to produce up to 100 million tons of oil per year, or a fifth of what Russia currently pumps, Reuters noted.', 'But the Arctic is more significant to Russia for more than resources and it has an important economic, defensive and transport value too. It has symbolic and nationalistic value, Østhagen said.', '“The name of the game in the Arctic is presence,” he said, noting that the region had value for Russian President Vladimir Putin who has overseen a rise in Russian nationalist sentiment during his two decades in power.', 'But that drive to magnify Russia’s status on the world stage has competed with its sluggish economy in the last five years, following a slump in oil prices on which it largely relies in terms of export revenues. Russia’s changing economic fortunes were reflected in its spending plans for the Arctic region, in which it had planned super-projects as part of an “Arctic Program” of investment and development.', 'In 2017, RBC news agency reported that funding for the program had been slashed severely: the Ministry of Economic Development had wanted 209 billion rubles for the new national Arctic Program, funding that would take it up to 2020, but was expected to get only 12 billion ruble.', 'There are signs of recovery now, however, and the economy is expected to grow 1.2% in 2019; 1.6% in 2020; and 1.8% in 2021, the World Bank forecast earlier in December. Experts agree that the cost-benefit analysis of Arctic expansion, a region whose hostile environment quickly increases operational costs, needs to be carefully assessed.', '“Arctic development is indeed costly for Russia, but the government deems it necessary, and legitimate, to perform ‘great power status’ across this new frontier, as well as to anticipate the negative impact of climate change for coastal regions in the Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation,” Mathieu Boulegue, a research fellow at the Russia and Eurasia Programme at Chatham House, told CNBC. ', '“Civilian investment, however, has been tremendously slashed since 2017, with few prospects to increase again for the time being,” he noted.', 'In 2017, Russian military spending fell by a fifth marking its first decline in nearly two decades and data from 2019 showed Russia was no longer in the top five global military spenders, just as the U.S. and China have increased spending.', 'Martina Bozadzhieva, managing director of research at consultancy firm DuckerFrontier, told CNBC that defense spending was continuing to decline in Russia, with money being redirected toward other pressing domestic issues.', '″(There is now) the focus on the domestic economy, income standards, and what you’ve seen over the last couple of years is that there was a big spike in military spending, some of which went towards a range of strategies including the Arctic. But that military spending growth is being wound down to free up money for salaries, pensions etc,” she said.', '“That money is being redirected. So it’s not to say that Russia is trying to pull back from the Arctic, it’s more that the funding is being restructured.”', 'One of the projects that combines economic and symbolic importance for Russia is the Northeast Passage or Northern Sea Route (NSR), a once inaccessible shipping route in the Russian Arctic that, as ice sheets melt, Russia sees as a future shipping super highway to transport goods and resources between Asia and Europe. It hopes the route could rival the traditional Europe-Asia sea route, via the Suez Canal, as it shortens the shipping duration by around 15 days.', 'The Arctic institute’s Andreas Østhagen noted that the NSR fulfilled both an economic and symbolic need for Russia to assert itself in the Arctic (the NSR runs along the entirety of its territorial waters, from the Bering Strait between Siberia and Alaska to the Barents Sea, near Norway) but that it might be too early for Russia to reap the economic benefits yet, given the hostile environment for much of the year and the need for more maritime infrastructure.', '“The route has symbolic and nationalistic connotations — just for Russia to be present and to develop the sea route and its military capabilities there, but also the economic benefits, although it’s questionable how large these will be,” he said, noting it would be costly for companies to operate there, particularly with the need for ice breakers for most of the year.', '“We could see increased destinational traffic there, like services for the Yamal LNG superplant, or tourism traffic with cruise ship vessels. But it won’t be that lucrative, it won’t have the volume of shipments like the Suez or Panama Canal,” Østhagen said.', 'Aside from Russia’s commercial development of the Arctic, another pressing issue in the region, and a concern for the western military alliance NATO, is the perception that the area is becoming an increasingly militarized space, opening up a new, literally cold front in already frosty relations between Russia and the West.', 'In recent years, Russia has advanced its military capabilities in the Arctic, reopening old military bases that had been abandoned following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, and bolstering the Russian Navy’s prestigious Northern Fleet that oversees operations and defense in the region.', 'The Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command was created in 2014 as Russia’s fifth military district, reflecting the Kremlin’s push to give defense in the region more weight; Putin announced that same year that Russia would build a unified network of Arctic defense infrastructure and improve the fleet’s warships and submarines.', 'The Northern Fleet and military exercises in the Arctic were a key part of Russia’s massive annual military drills, called Tsentr 2019, this year too. ', '“Russia has been consistently incorporating the Arctic in military thinking for less than a decade and therefore training, procuring and learning to survive, move, and fight in this extreme environment. Furthermore, a lot of effort has been put into deploying Arctic-capable air defense and sea denial systems,” Chatham House’s Boulegue told CNBC.', 'NATO has been increasingly concerned about what it sees as Russia’s militarization of the Arctic and it has been warned that it must increase its own presence to counter what some see as Russian aggression. DuckerFrontier’s Martina Bozadzhieva told CNBC that the Arctic was one area where Russia had an advantage, given its geography.', '“They (Russia) have been trying to double-down in areas they can really dominate, just because relative to NATO defense spending, Russia is actually not spending that much. So where they do have a natural advantage, as they do in the Arctic, they will be looking to press that advantage,” Bozadzhieva told CNBC. Boulegue and Østhagen believe that Russia is looking to avoid conflict in the Arctic, however.', 'Østhagen said military advances in the Arctic could on the one hand be seen as for domestic, defensive purposes or as potentially aggressive, but, he noted, “Russia would not have any interest in claiming any territory, but what you see beyond this is a focus on the Arctic strategically, as well as from China and the U.S., which brings the region into a geopolitical and geostrategic competition between these actors.”', 'With the Arctic offering apparently abundant resources, albeit difficult and expensive to extract, it’s no surprise that other Arctic nations (there are eight in all: Canada, Denmark (Greenland), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Russia, and the U.S.) are also interested in developing their Arctic infrastructure and resources within their own territories too.', 'It’s just that Russia’s Arctic infrastructure happens to be more developed as it has more long-standing cities (like Murmansk and Norilsk), communities and investment there, experts note.', 'Despite varying degrees of competition and military tensions in the Arctic region, there are attempts at coordination and cooperation between Arctic states too, although at times somewhat reluctantly.', 'Dialog between Arctic states is frequent, for example; an International Arctic Forum was held in Russia in April with the summit dedicated to discussing the “socioeconomic development of Arctic regions and for developing multi-level, multilateral mechanisms for joint discovery and effective exploitation of the Arctic’s rich natural resource potential.”', 'Then in May, the Arctic Council (an intergovernmental forum to provide a means for promoting cooperation, coordination and interaction among the Arctic States) met in Finland. True to recent form, a joint declaration of intent from the council members was reportedly canceled because of the U.S.′ refusal to sign a declaration — aimed at balancing environmental protection in the Arctic with the development of its mineral wealth — because it referenced climate change as a serious threat.', 'Aside from tensions over environmental challenges and defense, several Arctic states (but particularly the U.S.), are worried about the ambitions and intentions of a non-Arctic state increasingly involved in the region: China.', 'China published its own Arctic Strategy in January 2018, laying out its interest in the region and it has been increasingly investing in Arctic infrastructure and energy projects, like the aforementioned Yamal LNG project in which its Silk Road Fund (a state-owned investment project) has a 9.9% stake, making it the largest foreign shareholder in the project.', ' Putin has welcomed Chinese investment, inviting the People’s Republic in late 2017 to help create an “Ice Silk Road,” or Polar Silk Road; essentially, another strand of China’s mega economic development project, the Belt and Road Initiative.', 'China has also invested in research stations in Iceland and Norway, and said it will collaborate with Russia on a research center to predict ice conditions along the Northern Sea Route and last year launched its first polar research ship, the icebreaker, Xuelong (or Snow Dragon) 2, that can break through 1.5 meters of ice. Like Russia, it is now building a nuclear-powered icebreaker; Russia launched its own, the Ural, in May.', 'The icebreaker will be one of a trio that will be managed by Russia’s state-owned nuclear energy corporation Rosatom, Reuters reported. The Ural and its sister ships are “central to our strategic project of opening the Northern Sea Route to all-year activity,” Alexey Likhachev, Rosatom’s chief executive, was quoted as saying. ', 'Russia and China have strengthened their geopolitical ties in a variety of areas in recent years and no less so than in the Arctic where both want to take commercial advantage of the Northern Sea Route. But China’s increasing activities in the region are alarming to the U.S. In May, the Pentagon released a report saying deepening Chinese activities in the Arctic region could pave the way for increased military activity there.', 'At the Arctic Council in May, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticized China’s claim to being a “near-Arctic” state, saying that entitled it to “exactly nothing” in the region.']"

', '“I don’t know if he’s told Brian any differently,” Buford said. “Pop’s shown nothing other than how we’re going to build our team for next year.”', 'But Buford added: “Pop’s vision will be in play long after his presence. That doesn’t mean it’ll be him in there making those decisions, but we’ve all learned together, and you’re not going to step away from a values-based, team-building aspect that focuses on culture and coming to work every day and working on it.”', 'As the Spurs approach 50 years in the NBA, the team is looking to celebrate its organization, Buford said. He concluded the Zoom discussion assuring the Holt family’s commitment to San Antonio despite turning a $75 million investment in 1993 to $1.8 billion and a recent minority ownership change.', '“Pieces change all the time – not much here but in other organizations,” Buford said. “Individual investors, for whatever reason, change all the time. But the Holt family’s commitment to the community, we’re here in San Antonio to stay.”']"
65,The two main sticking points behind Trump’s push to build more cars in the US,2017-01-24T19:25:53+0000,"['  President Donald Trump is hitting the gas on his bid to have more vehicles built in the U.S.', '  Ahead of Tuesday’s meeting with the CEOs of General  Motors, Ford and Fiat  Chrysler, Trump tweeted that he wants “new plants to be built here for cars sold here!”', '  He reiterated that determination during the morning’s meeting, promising to make it more economical for automakers to build vehicles in the U.S.', 'As the president puts pressure on automakers to bring jobs back to the U.S., here are two numbers that are likely gnawing at him.', '  Last year, Americans bought 17.55 million new vehicles — and  43 percent of them were imported. That’s more than 7.5 million  cars, trucks, SUVs and minivans coming in from around the world.   ', '  The two biggest countries shipping vehicles to the U.S. were  Mexico, at 11 percent, and Canada, at 10 percent. Detroit’s Big  Three automakers alone brought in 2.25 million vehicles that were  eventually sold to Americans.  ', '  Trump has repeatedly said that automakers can — and  should — be building those vehicles in the U.S. On Tuesday,  he told GM’s Mary Barra, Ford’s Mark Fields and  Fiat Chrysler’s Sergio Marchionne that he would make operating  in the U.S. more attractive for them, by cutting regulations and  taxes.', '“We just had a great conversation with the president, and he is  very focused on the policies that will grow investment, jobs,  here in America and American industry and of course in the  automotive industry,” Fields said after the meeting.', 'Still, don’t expect auto CEOs to immediately announce  multibillion-dollar investments to bring production back from  Mexico. That’s because the cost of building a vehicle there is  far cheaper.  ', '  Take the Ford Fusion, a midsize sedan the automaker builds in  Mexico. The Center for Automotive Research estimates Ford can  manufacture that car for approximately $1,200 less in Mexico than  in the U.S.', '  Of course, the economics could change if Trump moves forward with  plans to tax imports by 35 percent.', '  When the U.S. auto industry almost collapsed in 2009, the Big  Three automakers cut hundreds of thousands of jobs and closed  several assembly plants. By June 2009, U.S. auto manufacturing  jobs bottomed out at 623,500, according the U.S. Department of  Labor. ', '  Since then, as demand has rebounded, automakers and suppliers  have hired more than 300,000 workers. That’s welcome news in  states like Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, where the auto industry  supplies hundreds of thousands of jobs. Still, the number of people working in the industry is well below the 1.1 million it employed in January  2006.', 'Trump has said more plants will lead to more blue-collar jobs.', '  “We have a very big push on to have auto plants and other plants  — many other plants,” Trump told reporters Tuesday. “It’s  happening.”', '  So far, the United Auto Workers has not commented on the president’s push. But there’s no doubt union leaders would love  to see another GM, Ford or Fiat Chrysler plant where they could  add hundreds of new members.', '  — Reuters contributed to this report.']"
66,Nissan opts to build new model in UK after May pledges Brexit support,2016-10-27T12:04:17+0000,"['  Japanese car-maker Nissan will build its new Qashqai model in Britain despite the vote to quit  the EU, giving Prime Minister Theresa May her most important corporate  endorsement since the Brexit referendum in June.', '  The decision to build the new model at Britain’s largest car  plant, rather than elsewhere in Europe, was won with what a source described as  a package of support pledged by May’s government to counter any damage from  leaving the EU. ', '“This vote of confidence shows Britain is open for  business and that we remain an outward-looking, world-leading nation,” May said in a  statement. ', 'Britain’s big car-makers are nearly all  foreign-owned and ship more than half of their exports to the other 27 countries in the European  Union. They had collectively warned that the June vote  would make Britain a less-attractive destination for foreign investment, and Nissan in  particular had threatened to halt spending unless the government guaranteed it  would be protected. ', '  Sunderland, in the north east of England, built almost one in  three of Britain’s cars last year. The decision over the new model was  crucial to the fate of its 7,000 workers. ', 'Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn, who met May earlier  this month, said the British government had promised to ensure the competitiveness of  the plant, convincing the firm to build the next version of the Qashqai  there and also start production of a new SUV, the X-Trail. ', '“The support and assurances of the U.K. government  enabled us to decide that the next generation Qashqai and X-Trail will be produced at  Sunderland,” Ghosn said. ', 'Japan’s Nissan is part of an alliance with French  car-maker Renault, its largest shareholder. Ghosn runs both  companies. The firm made the formal announcement after Reuters  reported that the decision had been taken. A separate person familiar with the  situation told Reuters that the British government had pledged to provide  additional relief to Nissan in the event of any negative effect on its business  resulting from Brexit.', '  A company spokesman said that assurances from the government had  helped the firm bring forward its decision, which had originally been  expected early next year.', 'The Sunderland plant has been a point of pride for  May’s Conservative Party since then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher persuaded Nissan to  open it in 1984, beginning a recovery in British car-making that had nearly  collapsed in the 1970s. ', 'The area, like other parts of England’s industrial  north, voted heavily in favor of Brexit on June 23, despite car manufacturers and their  unions campaigning to stay in.  ']"

', 'Shares of Lowe’s, which has a market capitalization of $83.6 billion, climbed more than 5 percent Friday afternoon when Bloomberg first reported on the position. Shares of Home Depot also briefly jumped on the news. ', 'Lowe’s has by and large lagged behind its biggest rival Home Depot. The company has made efforts to catch up to the Atlanta-based retailer in part by mimicking its strong professional and contracting business. These efforts include two acquisitions worth more than $500 million announced last May. ', 'Lowe’s, which some analysts say has weaker real estate than Home Depot,  has also seen its same-store sales growth lag behind its rival.', 'Both have benefited from a recent slew of devastating hurricanes in the U.S., which sent shoppers to their stores in droves to pick up relief supplies and rebuilding materials. Emergencies tend to benefit brick and mortar retailers over online players, because they can offer needed supplies immediately. ', 'The two compete with Ikea and and e-retailer Wayfair. Amazon has so far posed less of a threat, in part because of the expense attached to shipping heavy home improvement items.', 'Looking ahead, Lowe’s has said it expects revenue to increase roughly 5 percent by the end of fiscal 2017, with sales at its established stores rising 3.5 percent. Lowe’s is also on track to have added about 25 home improvement and hardware stores before the end of its fiscal fourth quarter. ', 'In an attempt to lure younger shoppers, Lowe’s has been experimenting with technology and opened up “smart home centers” at some locations ahead of the holidays. ', 'Lowe’s stock is up more than 40 percent from a year ago, while shares of Home Depot have climbed more than 45 percent over the same period. ']"
