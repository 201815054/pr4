0,The tech industry is looking to replace the smartphone — and everybody is waiting to see what Apple comes up with ,2021-02-20T14:00:01+0000,"['In 2007, Apple unveiled the iPhone.', 'Apple didn’t invent the smartphone — companies like Palm and Blackberry had been selling them for years. But the iPhone introduced a totally new way to interact with computers. The always-on internet connectivity, finger-friendly touch screen, and interface based around clickable app icons all seem commonplace now. But at the time, the whole package felt revolutionary.', 'The smartphone was a seismic shift for the technology industry, creating entirely new business models — apps became $100 billion companies -- while replacing everything from digital cameras to in-car GPS systems.', 'But smartphone sales have dropped two calendar years straight for the first time, according to Gartner. Smartphones are old news.', 'The tech industry’s next bet is a series of technologies usually called augmented reality (AR) or mixed reality. The vision usually involves some kind of computer worn in front of the user’s eyes.', 'Users will still be able to see most of the real world in front of them — unlike virtual reality, which completely immerses the user in a computer-generated fantasyland, augmented reality layers computer-generated text and images on top of reality.', 'Industry watchers and participants think that Apple has a good chance to validate and revolutionize AR like it did with smartphones. Apple has been prototyping headsets for years, and recent reports from The Information and Bloomberg suggest that Apple could release a headset as early as 2022 that could cost as much as $3,000.', 'But Apple’s not the only company working on these products. All the big tech players — Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and Amazon — are in the game as well.', 'Futurists and screenwriters have conjured blue-sky visions of what could happen with advanced computer glasses — one episode of the dystopian anthology “Black Mirror” explored a world where people could “block” certain people out of their view. More positive visions imagine having important information coming directly into your view, exactly when you want it.', 'Today, the most common use cases are much more mundane, including smartphone-based games and apps like Pokemon Go or Apple’s Ruler app, which use the phone’s screen and camera rather than relying on glasses or another set of screens sitting on your face. The few companies who are actively producing AR glasses are mostly focused on work scenarios, like manufacturing and medicine.', '“That’s where we now sit in spatial computing’s lifecycle. It’s not the revolutionary platform shift touted circa-2016,” said Mike Boland, technology analyst and founder of ARtillery Intelligence, in a recent report. “It’s not a silver bullet for everything we do in life and work as once hyped. But it will be transformative in narrower ways, and within a targeted set of use cases and verticals.”', 'Here’s what the biggest companies in tech are doing to try and make augmented reality the next big thing:', 'Apple’s generation-defining success with the iPhone has made it the company to watch in augmented reality -- even though the company has never confirmed it is working on a headset, glasses or any other kind of head-worn computer.', 'Boland says that if Apple were to release a pair of AR glasses, it could “determine the fate of the AR industry,” given the company’s track record of popularizing new technologies.', 'A report from Bloomberg last month suggested Apple’s first AR product could be out as early as next year. Its first shot will reportedly a battery-powered headset that’s primarily designed for virtual reality, but with on-board cameras to enable augmented reality as well. The report says this device could cost thousands of dollars and be available only in low volumes -- more typical of a test platform for software developers than the mass-market products Apple usually releases.', 'Eventually Apple could take lessons it learns from the virtual reality headset and apply it to a pair of lightweight AR glasses with transparent displays. But according to Bloomberg, that project still faces additional work on technical issues such as miniaturization and lens technology.', 'Display technology is another limiting factors for augmented reality. The transparent displays currently on the market have a limited field of view in which they can display graphics, are often not bright enough for daylight use, and generally could be better suited for all-day wear.', 'Apple’s working on solving this problem, too, according to a report in Nikkei Asia. The newspaper says that Apple is working with TSMC, its primary processor manufacturer, to develop a new kind of augmented reality display that’s printed directly on wafers, or the base layer for chips.', 'If Apple does eventually reveal a big leap forward in AR display technology -- especially if the technology is developed and owned by Apple instead of a supplier -- Apple could find itself with multi-year head-start in augmented reality as it did when the iPhone vaulted it to the head of the smartphone industry.', 'Of course, that’s assuming that there’s software worth using when the headset comes out. But Apple has already laid the groundwork for a rich software library.', 'In 2017, Apple released software called ARKit, which includes tools for software makers to determine how far away an object or wall is, if the phone is moving, or identify limbs in a human body, among other functions.', 'Companies like Ikea, Target, and Amazon have already used ARKit, mostly for placing virtual furniture in a room to see if it fits. Warby Parker uses it to enable virtual glasses try-ons through its app. Snap uses new iPhone 3D sensors to improve its face-shifting lenses, which advertisers can purchase. But so far, few ARKit apps have found a wider audience.', 'Apple is also adding hardware to its iPhones that hint at a headset-based future. High-end iPhones released in 2020 include advanced Lidar sensors embedded in their camera. These sensors can measure how far away objects are, and are currently used to execute fun filters and photo effects. But when paired with an advanced headset, their use could be more profound. Apple is considering using lidar sensors on its headset, according to The Information.', 'One way to look at Apple’s investment in the technology is to look at the companies it’s bought in the field. It’s bought a company that builds transparent optics, a headset maker, and companies that make software and content for augmented and virtual reality, including Akonia Holographics, Vrvana, Metaio, Emotient, Flyby Media, Spaces, and NextVR.', 'Google was the first major technology company to release a head-worn computer when it introduced Google Glass in 2013. It cost $1,500 at the time, and was explicitly targeted at people in the computer industry and early adopters, which Google called “explorers.”', 'Google’s approach was significantly lighter and simpler than what’s come since. Google Glass did not attempt to use advanced processing to integrate computer graphics into the real world. Instead, it was equipped with a camera, and had a little transparent display with relatively low resolution on the right temple. That display was used to project small bits of information into the user’s field of vision -- sort of like an Apple Watch or smartwatch on the user’s face.', 'But Google Glass was also a lightning rod for criticism -- it had a built-in video camera, and people who weren’t wearing it felt like they were being watched. One wearer said she was assaulted outside a San Francisco bar in 2014 for wearing the glasses.', 'Google paused Glass in 2015 and rejiggered it for business users. Last year, it started selling Google Glass for $999 per unit through some of its hardware resellers.', 'One key application for Glass is Augmedix, which uses the headset’s camera to cut down on the time doctors spend on busywork. The Glass camera streams an interaction with patients to “scribes” hired by the company who write down the important details and enter them into the patient record.', 'Last year, Google acquired North, a Canadian company making a pair of lightweight $1,000 smartglasses.', 'Microsoft announced its augmented reality headset, Hololens, in 2015, and released the first version in 2016. It’s now on its second version, which costs $3,500. It’s a niche device targeted for business sales. (Microsoft’s tagline: “Work smarter with mixed reality.”)', 'On its website, Microsoft touts manufacturing, retail, and healthcare as primary use cases. In factories, the headset can inform workers about how to fix or operate a complicated machine. Retailers, instead of having costly display items or large amounts of inventory, can virtually display their goods to customers, Microsoft suggests.', 'Microsoft’s store currently has 343 HoloLens apps. None are household names, and many are simple demos that display graphics like a birthday cake or fireworks.', 'Microsoft has invested heavily in these kind of technologies, purchasing AltspaceVR, a social network for virtual reality, in 2018. Before it launched Hololens, it paid $150 million for intellectual property from a smartglasses pioneer. It doesn’t break out Hololens sales or revenue.', 'Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks the most in public about his hopes for augmented reality. Last year, he said, “While I expect phones to still be our primary devices through most of this decade, at some point in the 2020s, we will get breakthrough augmented reality glasses that will redefine our relationship with technology.”', 'Facebook’s enthusiasm for augmented reality is driven in part by its dependence on smartphone platforms from other vendors today. In particular, Facebook has been balking at Apple’s control over the iPhone for years, and the fight has escalated recently as Apple is planning technical changes to the iPhone software that will hurt Facebook’s main moneymaker, mobile advertising.', 'If Facebook creates the next big platform, then it will set the rules.', 'Zuckerberg is also predicting massive societal change stemming from augmented reality: “Imagine if you could live anywhere you chose and access any job anywhere else.”', 'Facebook is already a leader in virtual reality, augmented reality’s cousin. It bought Oculus for $2 billion in 2014, a move that signaled the start of massive investment in these technologies. The latest Oculus headset includes cameras, costs $300, and sold 1 million units in December, according to an estimate from SuperData.', 'With cameras mounted on the front and powerful processing, virtual reality headsets can approximate augmented reality by displaying a real-time feed of the outside world. This feature is called “passthrough” on recent Oculus headsets, and it could be Apple’s initial approach as well.', 'The company is also working on lightweight AR glasses and hopes to launch a product this year in partnership with Luxottica, the sunglasses giant, CNBC previously reported.', 'Facebook is also working on “Project Aria,” which is a research-oriented pair of computer glasses that don’t have advanced AR displays, but can record video, audio, track the user’s eyes, and access location data.', 'Amazon is the tech giant with the least public enthusiasm about augmented reality technology, but it does sell a pair of smart glasses called Echo Frames. These don’t even have a display. Instead, the user interacts entirely through Alexa, Amazon’s voice assistant.', 'Amazon is also attacking augmented reality different angles. Last fall it released an “Amazon Augmented Reality” app, but it’s not a serious piece of software. Instead, it uses QR codes on Amazon shipping boxes to activate fun mini-games, like turning an Amazon box into a race car, or putting fun sunglasses on a dog.', '“Augmented reality is a fun way to reuse your Amazon boxes until you’re ready to drop them in the recycling bin,” according to the app’s description.', 'Other Amazon applications use augmented reality to place virtual furniture inside the user’s home to make sure it fits before making an online purchase.', 'But Amazon has many of the pieces to take augmented reality more seriously. It has expertise in computer vision, or the software that can identify what objects in a photo or video are. It has an industry-leading voice assistant that could be deeply integrated with the headset.', 'Amazon also has hundreds of thousands of warehouse workers that could be early adopters of AR glasses — one commonly pitched use case is to help “pickers” find items in a large warehouse more easily by highlighting them with computer graphics.']"
1,Secret documents show how North Korea launders money through U.S. banks,2020-09-20T21:39:27+0000,"['North Korea carried out an elaborate money laundering scheme for years using a string of shell companies and help from Chinese firms, moving money through prominent banks in New York, according to confidential bank documents reviewed by NBC News.', 'Wire transfers from North Korean-linked firms with opaque ownership sometimes came in bursts, only days or hours apart, and the amounts transferred were in round figures with no clear commercial reasons for the transactions, according to the documents.', 'Graham Barrow, a London-based anti-money laundering expert, said these kinds of transactions are “red flags,” and are all hallmarks of efforts to conceal the origins of illicit cash.', 'A trove of confidential bank documents reviewed by NBC News offers a rare glimpse into how North Korea — and other rogue actors — move illicit cash across borders despite international sanctions designed to block Pyongyang’s access to the global financial system. The suspected laundering by North Korea-linked organizations amounted to more than $174.8 million over a period of several years, with transactions cleared through U.S. banks, including JPMorgan and the Bank of New York Mellon, according to the documents.', '“Taken as a whole, you have what really, frankly, looks like a concerted attack by the North Koreans to access the U.S. financial system over an extended period of time through multiple different avenues in ways that were fairly sophisticated,” said Eric Lorber, a former official at the Treasury Department who worked on North Korea sanctions under the Trump administration.', 'The leaked documents are part of the FinCEN Files, a collaborative project with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, BuzzFeed News, NBC News and more than 400 journalists around the world, examining a cache of secret suspicious activity reports filed by banks with the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, known as FinCEN, as well as other investigative documents. The leaked documents were obtained by BuzzFeed.', 'As NBC News and other media outlets prepared to publish stories based on the leaked documents, FinCEN announced plans on Wednesday, Sept. 16, for a major overhaul of the nation’s anti-money laundering rules.', 'Suspicious activity reports (SARs) are filed by banks and other financial institutions to alert law enforcement to potentially illegal transactions, but do not necessarily represent evidence of legal wrongdoing. The reports are highly confidential and closely guarded by both banks and U.S. authorities.', 'The Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network condemned the leak of the documents, declined to comment on the content of the suspicious activity reports and said it had referred the matter to the Justice Department and the Treasury’s inspector general.', '“As FinCEN has stated previously, the unauthorized disclosure of SARs is a crime that can impact the national security of the United States, compromise law enforcement investigations, and threaten the safety and security of the institutions and individuals who file such reports,” the department said.', 'The documents cover a period mainly from 2008 to 2017, during which both the Obama and Trump administrations steadily tightened sanctions against North Korea to try to prevent the regime from building up its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile arsenal. The sanctions in part are meant to block the regime’s attempts to buy or sell material for its weapons programs and to secure hard currency. But the records convey a cat and mouse game in which North Korea — often with the help of Chinese companies — found ways to slip under the radar, experts said.', '“The documents you have in front of you, I think help explain why the North Koreans have been so successful at sanction evasion,” said Hugh Griffiths, who served as head of the UN Panel of Experts until last year tracking sanctions-busting by Pyongyang. “What you have is gold dust because so few journalists, or investigators generally, get access to banking internal compliance documentation.”', 'The leaked records underscore the enormous difficulties the U.S. and other countries face trying to block North Korea and other money launderers from penetrating the world’s financial markets, Griffiths said.', 'In one case, the bank documents convey in unprecedented detail how the chief of a firm in Dandong, a Chinese city on the North Korea border, conducted apparent money laundering even as she made no secret of her business dealings with the North.', 'U.S. authorities in 2016 and 2019 indicted Ma Xiaohong, her company, Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Corp., and other executives in the firm for money laundering and helping North Korea evade international sanctions.', 'No one has been extradited and charges remain pending. Federal prosecutors declined to comment.', 'One of the internal bank documents appears to have been written because of that federal investigation.', 'Before those indictments, Ma and Dandong Hongxiang routed money through China, Singapore, Cambodia, the U.S. and elsewhere to North Korea, using an array of shell companies to move tens of millions of dollars through U.S. banks in New York, according to the suspicious activity report filed by the Bank of New York Mellon.', 'According to the document, the bank reported in 2015 that it handled suspicious transfers of $85.6 million, and the document details $20.1 million of those transactions. The bank wrote that it was prompted to comb through its records because of a “government inquiry.”', 'The bank cited red flags in those transactions, including money that went to firms with obscured ownership that appeared to be shell companies. Some firms were registered in high-risk jurisdictions such as Cambodia, the bank wrote. Some transfers were sent in batches, only days apart and some on the same day. The bank also noted that there were no clear commercial reasons for the transactions and that they were in round amounts.', 'One transaction in 2009 featured a Singapore shipping concern called United Green PTE Ltd., whose directors included Leonard Lai. The Treasury Department later imposed sanctions in 2015 on Lai and his Singaporean company, Senat Shipping Ltd, for their links to a North Korean shipping firm that allegedly tried to move weapons from Cuba to North Korea. The sanctions are still in place. Senat and Lai could not be reached for comment.', 'The bank allowed dozens of transfers to go ahead despite media reports that showed Ma had talked openly about conducting business with North Korea. The Associated Press interviewed Ma in 2014 as part of a report on North Korean trade. North Korea Economy Watch, a newsletter affiliated with The Stimson Center, a Washington think tank, quoted Ma in 2010 looking forward to a new bridge that would increase trade with North Korea.', 'Tracking news coverage is a standard tool for banks trying to prevent money laundering, and the media accounts should have provided additional warning signs for the Bank of New York Mellon, said Barrow and other experts.', 'BNY Mellon said that under federal law it could not comment on any suspicious activity report that may have leaked. But the bank said it “takes its role in protecting the integrity of the global financial system seriously,” assists U.S. authorities and fully complies with applicable laws and regulations.', 'Another major U.S. bank, JPMorgan Chase, informed the Treasury Department in January 2015 about suspicious financial transactions possibly linked to North Korea. In its report, JPMorgan Chase said that it oversaw $89.2 million in transactions between 2011 and 2013 that benefitted 11 companies and individuals with ties to North Korea. The bank said it had previously flagged those companies in its own suspicious activity reports for sending funds to North Korea.', 'The firms included Faith Surplus Trading Development Ltd. of China, which the bank had noted in previous reports that most of its counterparties were suspected of sanctions evasion on behalf of North Korea and Iran.', 'The deals also featured SUTL Corp Pte Ltd of Singapore and Dandong Sanjiang Trading Co Ltd of Dandong, China. The bank wrote that its own “internal intelligence” was “linking them to considerable illicit activity involving the proliferation of weapons involving North Korea and transactions with entities in Iran.”', 'International shipping records maintained by Panjiva show Dandong Sanjiang has made at least 80 shipments to North Korea, and a 2014 United Nations report stated that the company was involved in North Korean shipping.', 'The bank reported that Faith Surplus Trading sent 14 wires worth $3.76 million to China Oil Singapore, a subsidiary of China National United Oil. That company had been cited in a previous suspicious activity report for allegedly violating U.S. sanctions on Iran, the bank wrote.', 'Faith Surplus went out of business in 2015. SUTL and Dandong Sanjiang did not respond to requests for comment.', 'It’s unclear why JPMorgan approved the transactions, given the suspicions raised previously about some of the entities involved. JPMorgan said it was prohibited by law to comment on specific suspicious activity reports. But the bank said it admitted to shortcomings in a report in 2014 and had invested in efforts to bolster anti-money laundering (AML) measures.', '“We acknowledged in that 2014 report that our existing AML controls needed improvement, and have since devoted considerable resources to comply with the laws and regulations governing anti-money laundering, terrorist financing and economic sanctions. Today, thousands of employees and hundreds of millions of dollars are devoted to helping support law enforcement and national security efforts,” a bank spokesperson said.', 'A key to much of the money laundering described in the documents involves correspondent banking, when a financial firm like Bank of New York Mellon or JPMorgan provides services to a foreign bank for currency exchange or other transactions. The world’s financial industry relies largely on doing business in U.S. dollars, and correspondent banking is a routine and crucial part of the international financial system that enables global trade, allowing money to flow across borders instantaneously. But it’s also a financial highway that money launderers like North Korea try to exploit, hoping their transactions will be overlooked amid the vast volume of financial traffic, experts said.', 'The Treasury Department said in a recent report that money launderers often use correspondent banking services to move illicit money across borders. In a March 2020 report, the Treasury department said “the most significant vulnerabilities in the United States exploited by illicit actors” include “the significant volume of foreign funds and number of transactions that are intermediated through U.S. correspondent banks.”', 'According to the Treasury report, “U.S. financial institutions often unwittingly process these transactions.”', 'Lorber, the former Treasury official, said both private banks and U.S. authorities lack the manpower and the resources to keep up with all the money laundering and sanctions-busting that takes place. But in recent years, partly because of aggressive U.S. sanctions, Western banks have become more vigilant about scrutinizing transfers and requiring more information from foreign banks, according to Lorber and other former Treasury Department officials.', 'The day-to-day effort to counter North Korea and other money launderers is a grueling contest, Lorber said. Shell companies can be set up quickly, in a matter of days, but it can take months or years to dismantle a laundering network, he said.', '“It’s a constant game of cat and mouse and the illicit actors really do have sort of the advantage in terms of how they move money,” Lorber said.', 'Bank compliance departments are focused on ensuring their company abides by the law, but they are not designed to operate like law enforcement agencies, Griffiths said.', '“The compliance departments are there to do as much as possible to avoid consequences on the way they conduct business.” Griffiths said.', '“Looking forward — if North Korean sanctions implementation is going to be a science again, at some point, then the only way for the U.S. and the wider international community to succeed is to really harvest information” from banks in the United States and Europe.']"
2,Why an emboldened Walmart is looking to beyond retail for future growth,2021-02-18T17:58:25+0000,"['Walmart wants to tap what it sees as its greatest asset: its reach.', 'Every week, 150 million customers visit its stores, website and app. The company not only wants to sell groceries, clothes and other items. It wants to chase new business opportunities, from bulking up its ad sales to becoming a major health-care provider. With the strategy, Walmart is acknowledging a tough reality: Retail may not be enough to power its future.', 'On Thursday, the retail giant’s leaders spoke at a virtual investor day and detailed a plan to sustain momentum as some coronavirus pandemic-related tail winds fade and online sales swell.', 'Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said the discounter will weave together diverse services that customers want, from issuing a credit or debit card to dropping off groceries on their doorstep. It will also increase investments to cater to customers’ changed shopping habits, such as automation that will help it keep up with the heavy volume of curbside pickup orders.', '“We feel emboldened and are now moving with even more speed and aggressiveness,” he said. “We’re scaling new capabilities and businesses and designing them to work together in a mutually reinforcing way.”', 'With the move, the big-box retailer is taking a page from retailers like Apple and Amazon that have built an ecosystem of products and services to deepen loyalty and win more of customers’ wallets. Amazon Web Services has been the profit engine of its parent company, helping the e-commerce giant offset the challenging economics of selling items it must pick, pack and ship.', 'It’s riffing off another Amazon strategy, too. This fall, it launched Walmart+, a subscription-based service with perks like free shipping and unlimited grocery deliveries to the home. The service costs $98 a year or $12.95 for a month.', 'Walmart faces skepticism as it unveils the new playbook, however. It fell short of fourth-quarter earnings estimates, despite a robust holiday season and sales lift from stimulus checks. The results and its forecast for moderating sales in the year ahead prompted a sell-off. Walmart shares closed Thursday down 6.48% to $137.66. Its market value is now $389.48 billion. In the fiscal year, Walmart grew its revenue by $35 billion, but higher sales alone won’t get it to higher profits.', 'Remaining competitive will require big-ticket investments. Walmart plans to spend about $14 billion in the coming year, improving its supply chain and adding automation, the company’s CFO, Brett Biggs, said. That’s higher than its typical rate of $10 billion to $11 billion, he said. These improvements will likely make online sales more efficient and profitable.', 'Still, McMillon sees a way for Walmart to capitalize on its assets — including its more than 4,700 U.S. locations. For example, the company can turn TV and checkout screens in stores into ad opportunities, use its large parking lots to support health clinics that it is opening in parts of the country and promote online merchandise through TikTok livestreaming events.', '“This is the right time to make these investments,” he said. “The strategy, team and capabilities are in place. We know where the customer is going. We have momentum and our balance sheet is strong.”', 'Walmart recently renamed its ads business and told CNBC it wants to grow that division by more than 10 times in the next five years. It has opened 20 health clinics with lower-priced medical services like annual physicals, dentist checkups and therapy appointments — with plans for more. It is launching a fintech start-up with investment firm Ribbit Capital to offer unique, affordable financial products for its customers and employees.', 'McMillon said the company must stay a few steps ahead, especially as it sees such rapid change in the retail industry. The pandemic has permanently changed how some customers shop by fast-forwarding many of the trends Walmart was preparing for, according to McMillion.', '“In the future, people will still want to shop in compelling stores, but more and more there will be occasions when they prefer to pick up an order or have it delivered,” he said.', '“Some customers will eventually allow us and pay us to keep them replenished in their homes on the items they routinely purchase,” he said. “For an increasing number of customers, Walmart will be seen more like a service. Customers will think of us as the merchant that serves their wants and needs, but in ways that take less time and effort.”', 'And that’s why it’s investing in turning its stores into mini warehouses that use robots and employees to quickly complete online orders for delivery or curbside pickup. That, in turn, will help attract more members to Walmart’s subscription service, Walmart+, since home deliveries are a key reason why customers sign up, he said.', 'But, McMillon added, Walmart is letting go of some areas as it invests in others. He said it will continue to divest from markets and businesses, which allow it to focus on areas with greater growth potential.', 'Correction: An earlier version of this misstated the number of visitors Walmart receives.']"

In the interim, it has been rolling out more perks catered to members of Amazon Prime, such as offering them an extra 10 percent off discounted products.', 'Amazon, which acquired Whole Foods in July 2017, had hoped to convert more Prime members into Whole Foods shoppers. The better Whole Foods is able to sync in-store shopping with Amazon Prime, the better it will be able to target its ads and promotions.', 'Prime’s ranks surpassed more than 100 million people last year. In addition to free two-day shipping and weekly Whole Foods deals, Amazon’s $119-a-year membership service offers streaming of music and movies and free two-hour delivery in certain ZIP codes.', 'Prime members now qualify for two-hour delivery at Whole Foods, they can use Alexa to add groceries to their Prime Now cart with their voice and arrange for grocery pick-up within 30 minutes at some locations.', 'The price cuts planned for Wednesday, however, extend beyond Amazon prime customers. Whole Foods will slash its prices on hundreds of products, with a focus on produce, such as greens, tomatoes and tropical fruits. Customers will save an average of 20 percent on the new reduced-price items.', '“Whole Foods Market continues to maintain the high quality standards that we’ve championed for nearly 40 years and, with Amazon, we will lower more prices in the future, building on the positive momentum from previous price investments,” CEO John Mackey said in a statement.', 'Whole Foods will continue to build on its special offers for Prime members, as well as efforts to promote sales online. The grocer is doubling the number of exclusive deals for Prime members, it said on Monday.', 'The company also hasn’t given up on trying to recruit more Prime members. In April, Amazon will offer Whole Foods customers $10 off a $20 purchase when they try Prime online. New members can try Prime free for 30 days.', 'Read the press release below:']"

Kuo is well known for predicting Apple products before they are announced based on information from Apple’s Asian supply chain. ', 'Kuo believes that new iPhones that he calls the iPhone 12, will not be announced this week because mass production isn’t far enough along yet. ', 'However, the iPad Air and Apple Watch models will get significant features, including a Touch ID fingerprint sensor included in the iPad Air power button, and a blood oxygen sensor in the Apple Watch 6 models, Kuo predicts. ', 'New iPhones will ship in October, according to Kuo, and could include four different models each with two different versions depending on which 5G networks they support. The four models are one with a 5.4-inch screen, two models with 6.1-inch screens and a large “Pro Max” model with a 6.7-inch screen. ', 'Only some iPhones will support speedy millimeter wave networks, which are the fastest type of 5G networks, and those phones will ship after the other models, according to the note. Millimeter wave networks are still being built in many countries around the world and are not widely available yet in most regions. ']"
