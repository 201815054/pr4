0,Why the next electric battery boom may be in cargo ships,2021-10-26T11:00:01+0000,"['The dozens of diesel-operated cargo ships floating off the coasts of Los Angeles and Long Beach in California aren’t just emblematic of the snarled supply chain. They’re contributing to the 1 billion metric tons of carbon emissions each year from marine shipping.', 'Start-up Fleetzero is aiming to provide solutions for both of these problems. Co-founders Steven Henderson and Michael Carter — graduates of the United States Merchant Marine Academy — are building battery-electric cargo ships that will not only help decarbonize the industry but could also ease supply chain bottlenecks by utilizing more of the available ports around the world.', 'And if that sounds a bit far-fetched consider that Elon Musk said way back in 2017: “Everything will go fully electric, apart from (ironically) rockets. Ships are the next easiest to solve after cars.”', 'In 2018, the International Maritime Organization, a regulatory arm of the U.N., set an initial goal of cutting carbon emissions from international shipping by at least 50% by 2050 compared with 2008. The problem with reaching that goal, according to Clean Air Task Force research, is that international shipping fleets would need to transition to net-zero carbon fuels.', 'CATF has cited ammonia as a likely option, though it noted that ammonia is at least triple the cost of conventional marine fuel. “Most of the solutions we’ve read about and seen will all wind up costing the consumer more,” Henderson said. “Either they use a fuel that is a derivative of a fuel we use today, or it’s a fuel that is going to cost more.”', 'As Henderson and Carter studied the problem, they concluded that the only sustainable way to decarbonize cargo ships is with electricity. “Believe me, we looked at everything including pumping molten salt into ships and cooling it,” Henderson said. Electric batteries became the focus for Fleetzero and the mission was to figure out how to make it cost competitive.', 'The solution: battery swapping. Fleetzero is experimenting with building electric batteries in standard 20-foot shipping containers which are modified to power smaller ships at sea. When a ship comes into port, the drained batteries in the container carrier are swapped out for new ones.', '“Our ships use rapid battery swapping to refuel, and in doing that we’re able to distribute the costs of our batteries over a greater number of shipping containers to a point where we can be competitive with diesel ships,” Henderson said.', 'Fleetzero is building its first battery pack prototype in Alabama, intending to convert a small diesel ship to use it by the end of 2022. Eventually, the co-founders say they will build their own ships, but for now, they are retrofitting smaller cargo ships that are powered by diesel. “It’s much faster for us to go to market that way,” Henderson said.', 'Not only does electrification potentially solve the carbon problem, but using smaller ships could help the supply chain dilemma. Cargo ships, with containers stacked sky-high, have grown bigger every year since the 1950s, Henderson said. And while, pre-Covid pandemic, that brought shipping costs down, it’s also reduced the number of ports around the world where these giants can dock.', '“The physical limitations aren’t the size of the ships, but the depths of the ports,” he said. “Long Beach and Los Angeles can handle these big ships, but the whole system isn’t set up to accommodate massive vessels with 20,000 containers on them all at once.”', 'By using smaller ships, additional ports around the world can be accessed, including big river systems like the Mississippi, said Carter, not only alleviating congestion and backlogs at ports but potentially reducing truck traffic.', 'Carter and Henderson also point out that electric ships put fewer crew members at risk. “Mike and I both spent years in the engine room of ships crossing the Pacific and Atlantic,” Henderson said. “It’s not a good work environment.”', 'With less maintenance and repair work than a diesel ship requires, both say they foresee better maritime jobs, less pollution and lower costs.', 'Other companies, including Amazon and Ikea, are pushing the ocean shipping industry to move to zero-carbon fuel sources by 2040, a decade earlier than the IMO’s initial goal set three years ago.', 'The pledge by these two retailing giants, as well as Patagonia, Michelin and Unilever, to use only zero-carbon fuel ocean vessels is indicative of a broader movement by companies to reduce their carbon footprint around the globe.', 'Companies have revamped everything from office buildings and warehouses to transportation networks to become more carbon neutral. With the supply chain and cargo ships in the spotlight, it follows that ocean transportation — so dependent on diesel — would be next.', '“In order to combat the climate crisis, we must rapidly decarbonize marine shipping,” said Jonathan Lewis, director of transportation decarbonization at CATF, in a statement announcing the consortium of merchants.']"

Bezos transitioned into the role of executive chairman of Amazon’s board.', 'As Amazon reported record profits during the pandemic, it also faced logistics and cost challenges while trying to keep up with demand, Jassy said. Amazon quickly scaled up its warehouse network to be able to process more orders.', '“We spent Amazon’s first 25 years building a very large fulfillment network, and then had to double it in the last 24 months to meet customer demand,” Jassy said.', 'Amazon had 410 fulfillment centers and 260,000 delivery drivers worldwide as of the end of last year, Jassy said.', 'On top of logistical challenges, Amazon also dealt with the effects of a tightening labor market, which made it difficult for the company to move inventory as efficiently as it could before.', 'Supply chain constraints also added another challenging layer, as ocean, air and trucking capacity became constrained and container prices shot up.', '“It’s not normal for a company of any size to be able to respond to something as discontinuous and unpredictable as this pandemic turned out to be,” Jassy said. “What is it about Amazon that made it possible for us to do so? It’s because we weren’t starting from a standing start.”', 'You can read the letter in full below:']"

However, most of that new capacity won’t be ready until 2023 at the earliest — until then, a shortage of ships persists, Huxley added.', 'In addition, more investments in infrastructure like ports, roads and bridges are needed — but that, too, could take years to materialize, he said.', '“All of these issues, they are here to stay for quite a while to come,” said the CEO.', '“So I’m afraid that this is actually going to end up translating into higher costs for consumers down the line and indeed shortages of some goods,” he added.', 'Bottlenecks in global supply chains have threatened the supply of a whole range of goods, including food and beverages, consumer electronics and Christmas decorations.', 'Such constraints have contributed to higher inflation. Some economists have warned that inflation could stay higher for longer than expected.', 'The International Monetary Fund said last month that it largely concurred with assessments that current price increases will eventually ease, but noted there was “high uncertainty” around those forecasts due to inflationary risks in developed nations including the U.S. and the U.K.', 'The Fund said central banks should be prepared to tighten policy in case inflation gets out of control.']"

To that end, tomorrow morning, vaccines will start rolling from manufacturing to distribution hubs,” said Gen. Gustave Perna, chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed, at a briefing by the Health and Human Services Department Saturday. “And then by Monday, vaccines will be received.”', 'FedEx and the United Parcel Service will play crucial roles in distributing the vaccine, which is fragile and requires special treatment. Shipments will get priority access at the airport. If a plane with vaccines is coming in for landing, other passenger planes will have to circle and wait their turn. ', '“The reason we’re both here and we’re both doing this is because we’re the only ones that can,” said Richard Smith, executive vice president of FedEx Express, referring to both FedEx and UPS.', 'Unlike the other vaccine candidates, Pfizer’s is especially difficult to store and ship. It needs to be kept super cold, as in minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit, in a sealed box, with dry ice.  ', 'That suitcase-sized box, something they call a “thermal shipper,” contains anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 doses.

The automated warehouse — big enough to fit nearly eight football fields — is a pricey bet for the grocer and an illustration of its e-commerce ambitions.', 'Three years ago, Kroger struck a deal with British online grocer Ocado to build a network of customer fulfillment centers, which it calls sheds, across the U.S. It chose Ocado because of its track record in the United Kingdom, where it’s gained popularity with customers. Kroger has opened two sheds so far, with plans for at least nine more over the next two years.', 'Florida is ground zero as Kroger rolls out a national strategy to become a more dominant e-commerce player. It has invested at least $55 million just on construction of its shed alone. It has hired 900 employees and counting across the state. And it has announced plans to use the state as a blueprint to break into new markets and take on grocery rivals, including entrenched regional players like Florida-based Publix and retail behemoths like Amazon and Walmart with market values that are about 54 times and 13 times larger than Kroger.', 'Kroger has argued that the sheds will help it keep up with customers who are buying more food and household items online — while increasing the money it makes from each of those orders. With its Florida expansion, the grocer must not only prove the sheds can power a large, profitable e-commerce business in a notoriously low-margin industry, it must also win over customers in a brand-new market where some may not even know its name. It may be the largest supermarket operator in the country, but in the state, Kroger is the newcomer and, at least initially, the underdog.', 'The playbook that the grocer is developing with Kroger Delivery in Florida will be useful as it expands the business to the Northeast. Last month, it announced plans to build a shed to serve customers in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut for the first time. It has not shared its timetable for that project.', 'CEO Rodney McMullen, 61, joined Kroger in 1978 as a part-time stock clerk. He said the company must invest in digital and break into new markets to stay relevant.', 'In his office at Kroger’s Cincinnati headquarters, he keeps a list of the top 10 food retailers over the past few decades. The company names and their rise — or fall — from the list remind him how quickly retailers can go from dominant to obsolete.', '“Every time that it [the retail industry] transitions, there’s going to be winners and losers,” he said in an interview with CNBC. “And all you have to do is be the one that’s in front of that trend change.

The vans keep groceries chilled in the Florida heat, even on long drives to far-flung rural communities with dirt roads.', 'But a short drive from Kroger’s central Florida shed is all it takes for Thornton to see the company’s competition — and its opportunity. Publix, a Florida-based grocer, has billboards advertising its delivery service, which is powered by third-party delivery company Instacart. Nearby, construction cranes dot the landscape in new subdivisions with big banners that call out “New Homes Coming Soon.”', 'The migration of people to the Sun Belt is why Kroger decided to plant its flag in Florida. Many Floridians have moved from other states where the grocer is already a household name, McMullen said, giving the company a quicker way to win business.', 'As U.S. population growth has slowed over the past decade, Florida has defied the trend with a more than 14% increase from 18.8 million in 2010 to 21.5 million in 2020, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. At least some of those new Floridians belong to wealthier households who moved to the state because of its low taxes — and they are an appealing customer base for grocers.', 'Kroger has nearly 2,800 stores across 35 states.

Other grocers, including Aldi, Sprouts Farmers Market and Amazon-owned Whole Foods Market, see opportunity in Florida, too, and are opening new locations there.', 'Thornton said she realizes that part of her job is getting the word out about Kroger. At traffic lights, drivers sometimes honk at the delivery van, roll down their windows and ask for the location of the nearest store. She hands them business cards with delivery service details.', 'Some customers are homebound seniors or older residents who flocked to the state for the warm weather and moved into large retirement communities, such as The Villages. Others are busy parents or shoppers who see home delivery as a way to save time.', '“I tell them the greatest tip you can give us is ‘Tell your neighbors,’” she said.', 'McMullen said Kroger’s online-only offering helps it stand apart. “If you go in with just physical stores, how do you distinguish yourself between what’s already there?” he said. “By going into the market with a shed, it’s really offering something that’s not offered in the same way today.”', 'Kroger Delivery’s service fee starts at $6.95 per delivery, on top of grocery charges.

He said it is “tracking ahead of where we thought we would be.” The service also has high repeat rates — a reflection, he said, that customers are pleased when they use it.', 'New customers tend to order fewer items initially, McMullen said. Over time, the home delivery orders resemble curbside pickup, he said, with baskets about “three times the size of somebody going into a store.”', 'One shopper who made the switch is Caitlin Zausner, a 35-year-old mother of two who lives in Bradenton — about 100 miles from Kroger’s shed in Groveland. When the pandemic began, she was pregnant, juggling a toddler and trying to reduce her family’s risk of getting Covid-19.', 'She stopped making frequent trips to her local Publix and started getting groceries through curbside pickup. Each Saturday, she put her 2-year-old, Emmy, in the backseat and drove to Walmart and a local farmer’s market to retrieve online grocery orders.', 'As they waited in the parking lot, she played kid’s music and kept dry Cheerios handy to keep the toddler busy. The weekly ritual took about an hour and a half.', 'That changed in June when Zausner read a Facebook post from a neighbor, who tried and liked Kroger Delivery. Zausner knew of Kroger from her sister-in-law who shops at its stores in Tennessee.', 'Even before the pandemic, Zausner said, she associated trips to the grocery store with stress: Will the baby sit in the stroller?

Now, a Kroger delivery arrives each week and she can spend her Saturdays at the playground.', '“It’s just a hassle to carve out time to go [to the grocery store] and have a list,” she said. “I don’t miss grocery shopping.”', 'While Zausner is a fan, not all Americans are on board. Habits need to change for Kroger’s risky bet to pay off. More than $1 billion for construction spending alone is on the line as Kroger looks to build 20 facilities across the country over time.', 'Then, there are labor costs. Despite the help from automation, Kroger must employ hundreds of pickers and delivery drivers, who are employees rather than gig economy workers. Driver pay starts at $19 an hour.', 'Meantime, Kroger pays Ocado an undisclosed portion of every sale as part of its agreement.', 'The grocer is banking on the premise that online grocery shopping will drive a larger and larger percentage of total grocery sales — and that customers will embrace home delivery.', 'At the moment, Americans tend to favor curbside pickup when they order online. That approach has financial incentives for consumers and retailers, since shoppers can skip fees and companies can reduce delivery costs.', 'Like other grocers, Kroger’s online business took off when the pandemic began as consumers cooked and dined more at home. Its digital sales more than doubled in fiscal 2020 from the prior year. Kroger’s shares are up 35% year to date, putting its market cap at $31.94 billion.', 'As consumers return to restaurants and travel, growth has tapered off for online grocery shopping, but it has persisted at a much higher level than pre-pandemic. About half of U.S. households — 64.1 million in total — bought groceries online through ship to home, delivery or pickup in September, according to a survey in late September by Brick Meets Click, an independent research initiative, and sponsored by Mercatus, a digital commerce tech provider.', 'Online grocery orders now drive 12.3% of all grocery sales versus 1.8% pre-pandemic, according to the polling done by Brick Meets Click/Mercatus. That translates to $8 billion of roughly $65 billion in monthly grocery sales.', 'Online grocery shoppers placed an average of 2.76 orders in September — a higher and more stable number than a year ago, its surveys said.', 'Kroger points frequently to Ocado’s success on its home turf. British shoppers have embraced online grocery shopping more than Americans and generally favor home delivery instead of pickup.', 'In the U.S., Kroger has said the sheds can churn out orders for curbside pickup, too — at least in markets where it has stores. This is already happening in Ohio.', 'Karen Short, a retail analyst at Barclays, said the landscape has changed dramatically since Kroger struck the Ocado deal. At the time, she said, Kroger felt an urgency to catch up to Amazon and Walmart. It was nearly a year after Amazon bought Whole Foods, a move that spooked legacy grocers. Meanwhile, Walmart was investing heavily in its e-commerce business.', 'Now, Short said, grocers can opt for lower-cost solutions. Walmart, for instance, the country’s largest grocer by revenue, is carving out parts of its stores and turning them into mini, automated warehouses — a strategy called micro-fulfillment. Albertsons struck a deal with third-party delivery company DoorDash.', '“The problem you have now is Kroger is locked into this high capital expenditure commitment,” she said.', 'Plus, she said, construction costs have likely ballooned from the grocer’s initial projections as the price of materials and labor rise. (Kroger declined to comment on the final cost.)', 'Short estimates that Kroger pays 4% or 5% of every dollar of sales to Ocado — less than the estimated 8% it had paid Instacart in 2018 when it signed the deal with the British online grocer. She said that lower fee is now likely in line with third-party players like Uber Eats and DoorDash, which could fulfill orders without the need for sheds.', 'She has a sell rating on Kroger, with a price target of $37. That’s roughly 14% below where Kroger closed Wednesday.', 'For grocers, including Kroger, a big challenge is turning e-commerce sales into ones that are just as profitable — or more profitable — than a sale at a store, even while taking on additional labor and delivery costs.', 'Kroger has said each shed will break even in its third year of operations and by the fourth year, it will match the profitability rate of a store. And it’s said one shed is equal to 20 stores worth of sales, but with only 60% of the capital and labor.', 'Matt Fishbein, retail analyst at Jefferies, said hitting that benchmark will be the grocer’s biggest challenge. If it doesn’t bring down the cost of fulfilling online orders, the addition of sheds in its current grocery markets could potentially divert foot traffic away from its stores and toward a sale that makes less money. He has a hold rating on Kroger, with a price target of $40. That’s about 7% below where shares are currently trading.', 'Short said Kroger’s Ocado deal could play out best, however, in new markets like Florida where it can gain share without cannibalizing store sales. In regions like Florida, the Northeast and Northern California, she said Kroger can beat rivals on price.', '“There’s pockets of the country where if you can do it and undercut your competitors and still maintain your margin — even with the fees that you pay Ocado — it seems kind of like a no-brainer,” she said.', 'Fishbein said Kroger’s first-party approach could give it an advantage over other grocers that use third parties, even though that comes with higher costs. He compared it to restaurants that rely on delivery companies and give up aspects of customer service, such as making sure that food arrives hot and having the data to make product recommendations or communicate directly with that customer.', 'But Fishbein said simply recruiting customers could trip up Kroger. Some shoppers are already hesitant to buy items like steak and fruit online, since they prefer to check for quality and ripeness.', '“Why would you think that Kroger delivering it is going to be fresher and better than you just getting off your butt, getting in the car and going down the street to Publix?” he said.', 'The Ocado deal is just one facet of its e-commerce strategy, McMullen said. The company also recently signed an agreement with Instacart to offer deliveries in as little as 30 minutes nationwide.', 'Kroger is already doubling down on Florida.

6,Maersk spends $1.4 billion on ships that can run on ‘carbon neutral’ methanol,2021-08-24T15:53:58+0000,"['Danish firm Maersk said Tuesday it is ordering eight large, ocean-going vessels able to run on what it called “carbon neutral methanol.”', 'The world’s largest container shipping firm said the vessels would be built by South Korea’s Hyundai Heavy Industries and have the capacity to carry around 16,000 containers. According to a number of reports, each ship will cost $175 million, making the total cost $1.4 billion.', 'In a video message, Morten Bo Christiansen, Maersk’s head of decarbonization, said the vessels would “hit the waters from early 2024.” He added: “Once they are all out there sailing on green methanol, they will save a million tons of CO2 every year.”', 'Maersk said the ships would have a dual fuel engine set up, a feature which increases costs. “Additional capital expenditure … for the dual fuel capability, which enables operation on methanol as well as conventional low Sulphur fuel, will be in the range of 10-15% of the total price,” it said. Its agreement with Hyundai Heavy Industries has an option for four extra vessels in 2025.', 'While the Danish shipping giant said it would run the vessels “on carbon neutral e-methanol or sustainable bio-methanol as soon as possible” it also acknowledged there were issues to overcome.  ', '“Sourcing an adequate amount of carbon neutral methanol from day one in service will be challenging, as it requires a significant production ramp up of proper carbon neutral methanol production,” Maersk said.', 'In simple terms, “carbon neutral” means CO2 emissions are offset by an equal amount of CO2 removal. If something is carbon negative, it means more CO2 is removed from the atmosphere than emitted.', 'Tuesday’s announcement comes a few days after Maersk said it had secured a supply of “green” e-methanol for what it described as “the world’s first container vessel operating on carbon neutral fuel.”', 'It said Denmark’s European Energy and its subsidiary, REintegrate, would set up a facility to produce carbon neutral e-methanol for use in a vessel designed to operate on it. The plant would then produce approximately 10,000 metric tons of e-methanol used by Maersk’s ship every year.', 'The e-methanol will be made using renewable energy and biogenic carbon dioxide, with production of the fuel for Maersk slated to begin in 2023. The United States Environmental Protection Agency describes biogenic emission sources as “emissions that come from natural sources.”', 'The environmental footprint of shipping is significant. According to the International Energy Agency, in 2019 international shipping — a crucial cog in the world’s economy — was responsible for approximately 2% of “global energy-related CO2 emissions.”', 'With major economies around the world attempting to cut emissions in order to meet net-zero targets, the shipping sector will need to find new ways of reducing the environmental footprint of its operations.', 'In April, Brussels-headquartered campaign group Transport & Environment published a wide-ranging report on decarbonizing shipping. Among other things, it stressed the importance of sustainable fuels going forward.', '“To achieve full decarbonisation of the shipping sector requires a new source of sustainable and renewable fuel,” its research said.', '“Fuels produced by additional renewable electricity (e-fuels or electrofuels) are the only scalable solution that fits the requirements of energy dense, deployable, and clean fuels,” it added.']"

Revenues were up almost 60% to $14.2 billion.', 'Container shipping rates have skyrocketed as the global economy bounced back from the Covid-19 pandemic and commodity demand recovered, while a shortage of containers exerted pressure on supply chains. More recently, a combination of rising retailer orders and slower turnaround rates due to Covid-19 outbreaks in several countries has driven prices even higher.', '“Right now in container shipping we have effectively unmet demand. The global capacity is not able to lift all of the demand and that is what is driving up freight rates,” Skou told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Friday.', '“At the same time, of course, we have had congestion in Los Angeles, we have had the Suez Canal closed for a week, we have one of the largest ports in China closed for more than a week in the last quarter, and that takes our capacity from the market, which adds to the problem, so to speak.”', 'Rates from China to the United States, for instance, have scaled fresh record highs above $20,000 per 40-foot box, up more than 500% from a year ago, according to freight-tracking firm Freightos.', 'Skou said businesses were attempting to serve robust retail demand while also building their inventories, evidenced in extremely low inventory-to-sales ratios in the U.S., which contributes to the strong demand for containers that is likely to continue through at least the next quarter.', '“We continue to build a higher-quality Ocean business with more long-term contracts, a rapidly growing and profitable Logistics business with more than half of the 38% growth stemming from top Ocean customers, and a value creating Terminals business, which doubled profitability in the quarter,” Skou said in statement accompanying the results.', 'Maersk’s return on invested capital now sits at 23.7% for the past 12 months, and Skou said the firm’s earnings and cash flow will enable it to make targeted acquisitions while returning cash to shareholders.', 'The Danish giant also announced on Friday the acquisition of parcel shipping companies Visible Supply Chain Management and B2C Europe, part of its plans to grow its e-commerce capabilities.', '“The outlook for the third quarter is strong and we expect that the current momentum in Ocean will continue into the fourth quarter, also benefitting our Terminals business,” Skou said in the statement.', 'Maersk on Monday upgraded its 2021 guidance to an underlying EBITDA of between $18 billion and $19.5 billion, with a projected free cash flow of at least $11.5 billion.']"

Customers at select clubs can browse the aisles, retrieve items that fit in the car trunk and ship other purchases directly to the home. They can check out all purchases in a single transaction on their smartphones.', 'Sam’s Club CEO Kath McLay said the company sees technology as a way to improve the customer experience and build on its gains over the past year.', '“We want to have great items. We want to have disruptive prices. And we want to make sure that we’re providing convenience to our members,” she told CNBC. “What we really learned through the pandemic was that we need to stay true to that strategy.”', 'During the health crisis, Sam’s Club rolled out curbside pickup to all its stores, as customers sought fast, contactless ways to pick up online purchases. The Scan & Ship service, announced Tuesday, is the latest way that Sam’s Club is using digital options to stand out from competitors. It will become a feature of Scan & Go, which allows customers to ring up purchases with a smartphone as they add items to their shopping carts.', 'The company has designed and launched app-based tools for employees, too, including a voice-enabled service called Ask Sam that helps locate items and answer customers’ questions.', 'By testing and launching new ways for consumers to shop, Sam’s Club has driven its own growth and become a tech incubator for its parent company.', 'Comparable sales, a key metric that tracks sales at stores open for at least the past 12 months and online, have grown faster at Sam’s Club than Walmart over the past year. In the first quarter ended April 30, Sam’s Club’s comparable sales growth and e-commerce growth outpaced its parent company as they rose 7.2% and 47%, respectively, compared with 6% and 37% at Walmart U.S.', 'Total membership at the warehouse club also hit an all-time high in the first quarter. The company does not disclose how many members it has.', 'Warehouse clubs had a moment to shine during the pandemic as stock-up trips became the norm and some necessities, such as soap and paper towels, were hard to find. Shares of Costco and B.J.’s Warehouse Club outperformed the S&P 500 last year. BJ’s stock rose nearly 64%, while Costco shares climbed 28% in 2020 compared with the 16% lift in the S&P 500.', 'The gains have been more modest since January.

Investors have been worried about whether Walmart will be able top last year’s strong performance.', 'Warehouse clubs have endured since Covid, surprising some investors who chalked up membership gains to a “period of panic” during the pandemic, said Steph Wissink, a managing director and retail analyst for Jefferies. Many of those customers are renewing memberships and continuing to fill up baskets, she said.', '“It wasn’t just a fleeting experience because of safety and stock-ups,” she said. “It was a true destination change. They’re buying more of their goods for their household.”', 'Real estate and demographic trends are expanding the clubs’ potential audience, Wissink said. As millennials get older, some are buying homes in the suburbs and living closer to warehouse clubs. Companies’ new attitudes toward remote work have inspired some people to move out of cities into houses with bigger yards, closets and pantries.', '“Buying two jugs of ketchup or buying two loaves of bread, all the sudden becomes a possibility,” Wissink said.', 'The mix of items in baskets has changed in recent months, too, she said, as shoppers spent stimulus checks and bought more general merchandise like furniture and electronics.', 'McLay said Sam’s Club has been surprised by some of the new patterns. For instance, she said, 45-count packs of toilet paper have remained a hot item because people became used to having backup inventory in their pantry. Food for home has sold at higher rates because workers with hybrid schedules now split their weeks between the home office and the corporate one.', 'McLay describes Scan & Go as “the closest you can get to an online purchase in the club.”', 'Sam’s Club, which has nearly 600 stores and about 100,000 employees, launched Scan & Go in 2016. Two years later, it opened Sam’s Club Now, a smaller store in Dallas where it tests new tech with customers. A short drive from that store, it opened an innovation center in downtown Dallas with nearly 300 engineers, user experience designers and data scientists who help design Sam’s Club technology.', 'Scan & Go gained new relevance over the past year, McLay said. It saw a nearly 44% increase in members using the Scan & Go app in the first quarter from a year earlier.', '“I keep saying to the team, it felt like it was a product that we created, which was waiting for a moment like a pandemic, because people just absolutely flocked to contactless payment. And there it was ready to go,” McLay said at a virtual conference hosted by Jefferies in June.', 'With Scan & Ship, Sam’s Club will bring online and offline even closer together, McLay said. It is being tested in three stores: a club in Murrieta, California; one in McKinney, Texas; and the Sam’s Club Now in Dallas. For Sam’s Club Plus members, shipping to the home is free.', 'Eventually, the direct shipping feature will be expanded to other clubs and to more items, from playsets and patio furniture to mattresses.', 'Tim Simmons, chief product officer for Sam’s Club, said stores may drive more sales by making certain purchases less of a hassle. “I would probably put more things in my cart if I didn’t have to haul it home,” he said.', 'The feature could also be used to sell out-of-stock items, merchandise that comes in other colors or sizes, or items like a motorcycle or bike that can be tricky to store in multiples on the sales floor, he said.', 'The goal is to make customer experience better, Simmons said. Over the past three years, it has taken numerous steps to achieve this. At its member services desk, it swapped out eight pieces of hardware for an iPad to speed up returns and sign-ups for new members. It turned binders of spreadsheets into a tool that uses machine learning to help bakers, butchers and other employees predict how many birthday cakes, rotisserie chickens or hoagies customers will need, based on past sales and factors like major holidays or weather patterns. And smartphone-based tools help workers prioritize tasks on the sales floor, such as restocking items, and assist managers in tracking the club’s sales metrics.', 'Some of the technology born at Sam’s Club is now used by Walmart — such as Ask Sam and Scan & Go, which is available to Walmart shoppers who belong to its membership program, Walmart+.', 'Along with serving as a tech incubator, Sam’s Club has been a training ground for executives who have become senior leaders at Walmart and beyond. Doug McMillon was Sam’s Club CEO before he became Walmart CEO. John Furner, another former CEO of Sam’s Club, now leads Walmart’s U.S. business as its president and CEO. And Roz Brewer, former Sam’s Club CEO, went on to become chief operating officer at Starbucks and recently became CEO of Walgreens Boots Alliance.', 'For Sam’s Club, technology is also a differentiator from Costco, its biggest rival.', 'Costco caters to a higher income consumer and charges more for its service, but it has been slower to adopt new features like curbside pickup. At the moment, that option is in a pilot phase at three clubs in New Mexico.', 'The average Costco member has a household income of more than $100,000 a year. They pay $60 to $120 a year for a premium membership. By comparison, a typical Sam’s Club member has a household income of $75,000 to $100,000 and pays about $45 per year for a basic membership or up to $100 for a Plus membership. The figures are based on company comments and estimates by Jefferies. Costco has 60.6 million members, as of its most recent quarter that ended in May. Sam’s Club does not disclose total membership.', 'According to Wissink, Costco emphasizes lucrative services that can quickly tally up, such as booking a car rental or vacation or ordering a hearing aid.', '“You see that increasingly they have volume and value created beyond the walls of their boxes,” she said.', 'So far that’s working in Costco’s favor. It drives nearly twice as much annual revenue per store as Sam’s Club. It has a slightly larger footprint at those stores, 146,000 square feet on average at Costco compared with134,000 square feet at Sam’s.', 'But Sam’s Club has “always been more on the leading edge when it comes to digital integration,” Wissink said.', 'Take the two companies’ apps. Sam’s Club app was downloaded almost twice as much as Costco’s app last year in the U.S. — about 9.6 million times versus 4.9 million times, according to Apptopia, a company that tracks mobile apps’ performance. Customers have given the Sam’s Club app higher marks, too, with 78% of Sam’s Club’s users giving it positive reviews versus just 27% for Costco, according to Apptopia.', 'So far, the tech advantage isn’t hurting Costco’s performance, Wissink said. But it’s possible that it could over time.', 'According to McLay, Scan & Go is “one of the stickiest products” Sam’s Club has developed and it is “one of the most significant elements of why people renew with us.”', 'McLay knows this because Sam’s Club closely monitors factors that increase the chance of a member renewing.', '“It’s one of those things that is a little addictive,” she said. “Once you do start using it and you have to go back and actually wait in a line in a retail outlet, it feels very yesterday.”', '—CNBC’s Christopher Hayes contributed to this report.']"

He said spot rates are up to about $6,000 per container compared with the usual price of $1,200.', 'Even rates from the U.S. have gone up, though not quite as dramatically, according to Yeager.', '“The reason for this is the Chinese are being so aggressive about trying to get empty containers back … that it’s hard to get a container for US exporters,” he wrote in an email to CNBC, adding that 3 out of 4 containers from the U.S. to Asia are “going back empty.”', 'In fact, the shortage in Asia has also led to a similar crisis in many European countries, such as Germany, Austria and Hungary, as shipping carriers redirect containers to the East as quickly as possible, said Woitzik.', 'There are a few factors stemming from the pandemic driving this phenomenon.', 'First, China is sending out a lot more exports to the U.S. and Europe than the other way round. Its economy bounced back faster as the virus situation within its borders was basically under control by the second quarter of last year. As a result, containers are stuck in the West when they are really needed in Asia.', 'There are about 180 million containers worldwide, but “they’re in the wrong place,” said Yeager of Redwood Logistics.', '“So what’s happening is what was already a trade surplus in China has turned dramatically more severe and the reality is, there’s three containers going out for every container that’s coming in,” he said.', 'Making matters worse, orders for new containers were largely canceled during the first half of last year as most of the world went into lockdown, according to Alan Ng, PWC’s mainland China and Hong Kong transportation and logistics leader.', '“The magnitude and pace of the recovery have caught everyone by surprise,” he said. “The sudden recovery in trade volume has seen virtually all of the major shipping lines needing to add significant container capacity to address the container shortage issue.”', 'The shortage is further exacerbated by limited air freight capacity. Some high-value items that would normally be delivered by air, such as iPhones, now have to use containers via sea instead, according to Yeager.', 'International flight volumes have plunged due to virus and travel restrictions.', '“Air freight companies typically use that extra capacity at the belly of a passenger plane. Well, there’s just not very many passenger flights, so not as much air service,” he said. “The lack of options, combined with this crazy amount of demand, has produced this crisis.”', 'The container crisis affects all companies that need to ship goods.

He pointed to a report by the Shanghai International Shipping Research Centre released in the fourth quarter last year, which said that the shortage issue is likely to last for another three months or more.', 'Chinese tech giant Alibaba’s logistic arm Cainiao launched a container booking service last week, citing the global shortage. It said its service would span over 200 ports in 50 countries, and port-to-port shipping fees would be 30% to 40% cheaper, according to Reuters.', 'But even the race to build more containers could be hobbled by delays, according to Yeager.

The machines are made by only one company: Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography.', '“ASML has a monopoly on the fabrication of EUV lithography machines, the most advanced type of lithography equipment that’s needed to make every single advanced processor chip that we use today,” said Chris Miller, assistant professor at the Fletcher School at Tufts University. “The machines that they produce, each one of them is among the most complicated devices ever made.”', 'EUV stands for extreme ultraviolet, an incredibly short wavelength of light that ASML generates in large quantities to print small, complex designs on microchips. The EUV light is created with tiny explosions of molten tin happening at extreme speeds and then bounced off unique Zeiss mirrors that ASML says are the flattest surface in the world. A small percentage of the EUV light particles reach the surface of a silicon wafer, where they print the minuscule designs that determine what each chip will do.', 'Demand for ASML’s EUV technology has soared during a global chip shortage that’s resulted in back orders for products ranging from PlayStation 5 consoles to Chevrolet Malibu sedans. The company’s stock price has skyrocketed more than 340% since the end of 2018, making ASML more valuable than some of its top customers, such as Intel.', 'ASML CEO Peter Wennink said the company has been bringing down semiconductor prices since it was founded 38 years ago and will keep doing so “for the next couple of decades.”', '“The world needs more chips,” Wennink told CNBC. “So we need to make more machines, which, by the way, will keep growing in average selling price as long as we can drive the cost per transistor down.”', 'Still, Wennink says the global chip shortage is “a Catch-22” for ASML.', '“We got a lot of messages from our suppliers that said, ‘Hey, we might be late in delivering our modules to you guys because we cannot get the chips.’ And we said, ‘If we cannot get the chips, we cannot make the machines to make more chips.’”', 'Wennink said ASML is still managing “but it’s a daily struggle.”', 'ASML has sold a total of about 140 EUV systems in the past decade, each one now costing up to $200 million, according to Wennink. The price tag for its next machine, called High NA, will be more than $300 million.', 'Its EUV machine is “so expensive that most companies cannot afford it,” said Joanne Itow, managing director of manufacturing at Semico Research. “It certainly has eliminated a lot of players out of the market,” including chip manufacturer GlobalFoundries, which decided a few years ago to stop working on more-advanced chips because of the high cost, she said.', 'Today, ASML sells the machines to only five chipmakers. The biggest three — Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Samsung and Intel — made up nearly 84% of its business in 2021. TSMC says that in 2019 it was the first to deliver high-volume chips made with EUV and that it has stayed in front ever since, with chip technology at least one node ahead of Samsung’s and Intel’s.', 'ASML’s dominance is a relatively new phenomenon. A decade ago, the company’s ability to research EUV was decided by major investments from Intel, Samsung and TSMC.

Then there is an optical system, which is going to take this image and project it on the wafer.”', 'By 1988, ASML had five U.S. offices with 84 employees and a new Dutch office in Veldhoven that eventually became its headquarters. CNBC got an exclusive tour of that facility in March.', '“When the industry was getting ready to jump into the early stages of EUV research, none of the U.S. firms were ready to take the plunge on what would be an expensive and risky proposition, whereas ASML was,” said Miller, author of the forthcoming book “Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology.” “ASML is a Dutch company, but it’s also a Dutch company that relies very heavily on U.S. components in particular for its machines.”', 'EUV machines are made up of several modules with hundreds of thousands of components, from nearly 800 global suppliers. Each module is built at one of ASML’s 60 locations around the world and then shipped to Veldhoven for assembly. After each assembled machine is tested, it’s disassembled for shipment to a chipmaker. The shipping requires 20 trucks and three fully loaded Boeing 747s. ', 'One country ASML won’t ship its EUV technology to is China.', '“Forty-two countries around the globe have agreed to put export control measures on it because it’s so critical,” Wennink said. “So it’s not our choice, it’s the choice of governments.”', 'As far back as 2018, the Trump administration reportedly pressed ASML not to sell EUV technology to Chinese companies. ', '“China has wanted to get into that race,” Itow said, “but there’s been politically generated reasons why China has not had access” to the technology.', 'ASML does deal with China in another capacity. The company refurbishes older lithography systems, called deep ultraviolet, or DUV, and sends many of those to the world’s most-populated country. Wennink said 96% of all machines ASML has ever sold are still working.', '“There’s a lot of debate about whether selling additional DUV equipment to China is also a national security risk, by letting China increase its ability to manufacture close-to-cutting-edge semiconductors,” Miller said. “I think there’s some chance that in the coming years, there are new restrictions that are imposed on ASML’s ability to sell DUV equipment to China as well.”', 'Before EUV, chipmakers could buy DUV lithography machines from three companies: ASML, Nikon and Canon. While Nikon, in Japan, is still a competitor in that market, ASML is the only option for EUV. Experts say it could take decades for any other company to catch up, both because of ASML’s proprietary technology and because it’s built complex, often exclusive, deals with hundreds of suppliers.', '“We’re unique to some of our customers, and some of our supplies are unique to us,” Wennink said. “And those almost symbiotic relationships, some people say, are worse than being married because you cannot divorce.”', 'One way ASML has insulated itself against supply chain risks is by purchasing some of its suppliers, such as Cymer in San Diego, where the EUV light source is produced. ASML also bought Berliner Glas, in 2020. Though a fire broke out at the Berlin site in January, Wennink said the damage won’t significantly impact system output this year.', 'ASML projects 20% sales growth in 2022 and annual revenue growth of 11% until the end of the decade.', 'Watch the video for a rare glimpse of the technology inside ASML’s clean rooms in California and the Netherlands, to see how EUV machines use precision lasers, exploding molten tin and ultra-flat surfaces to make the building blocks of our digital world.']"

Mid-sized retailers are especially at risk because many don’t have the capacity to implement a robust and efficient enough shipping strategy to keep up with the demand for fast deliveries.', 'This pressure comes largely from companies like Amazon, famous for its Prime two-day shipping, one-day and same-day delivery options. This has made consumers expect fast and free shipping, even though some may not even want or need it, said Stichter.', 'Online shopping during the holiday season last year did not hit as high of peak as expected, according to Maciuba. He suspects that shipping carriers are looking to make up for financial losses since they invested in building up infrastructure in preparation for increased demand that never materialized. On the other hand, retailers could benefit from lower-than-expected shipping costs. ', 'However, holiday surcharges that shipping carriers like FedEx and UPS implemented to prepare for the influx of orders aren’t going away. These surcharges will likely become the new normal moving forward, in addition to the 5%-6% annual increases that are usually seen, Maciuba predicted.', 'FedEx recently announced new peak surcharges on Express and domestic residential ground shipments for those customers who had a weekly volume of more than 30,000 packages. The 30-cents per package surcharge went into effect on Monday.

If they are supported just on  the ends, then the middles can flex, and that puts strain on the  metal,” he said.', '  U.S. manufacturers also typically fabricate pipes for pipelines in  40-foot-long segments, he explained. Trucks and trains deliver  those segments to the construction site, where workers lay them  end to end in trenches and weld them together.', 'The American Petroleum Institute provides standards for pipe made to transport oil, gas and water in the energy  sector.

That makes everything Puerto Ricans buy unnecessarily expensive relative to goods purchased on either the US mainland or other Caribbean islands, and drives up the cost of living on the island overall.', 'And while it’s fairly common for American presidents to temporarily suspend the Jones Act in the face of a natural disaster, the Trump administration hasn’t yet done so for Puerto Rico.', 'More from Vox: What every American needs to know about Puerto Rico’s hurricane disaster  Trump’s plan to sell tax cuts for the rich is to pretend they’re not happening  9 million kids get insurance through CHIP.

William Atkinson Jones of Virginia and relates to the legal status of the island.)', 'The goal of the legislation was to ensure the existence of a thriving US-owned commercial shipping industry, a topic that had become salient during World War I, when blockades underscored the close link between maritime commerce and warfare.', 'One section of the law requires goods transported by ship from one US destination to another to be carried on US-flagged ships that were constructed in the United States, owned by US citizens, and crewed by US legal permanent residents and citizens. The idea, basically, is that in case of war there should always be a big supply of American-made, American-owned, American-crewed ships that could be counted on (and, if necessary, conscripted) to supply American commerce even in hazardous conditions.', 'One could certainly imagine an alternative universe in which the law was a smashing success. Protectionism for US merchant shipbuilding and US-owned and US-crewed merchant ships could have nurtured an infant industry and turned the United States into a globally competitive maritime powerhouse.', 'That’s not what happened. Instead, global oceanic shipbuilding is dominated by Asian countries, with China, South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, and Taiwan dwarfing American production. US output of merchant ships is even fairly tiny compared to combined European production. According to Daniel Pearson of the Cato Institute, US merchant vessels carry about 2 percent of the world’s cargo, far down from the 25 percent they carried 60 years ago.', 'Rather than nurturing the creation of a global shipping powerhouse, protectionism for US shipbuilders has allowed the industry to survive despite being laughably uncompetitive in global terms. In most cases, that works out okay in practice because the United States has one of the world’s most robust networks of freight rail. The problem is that when disaster strikes, it would often be useful to mobilize boats quickly. And of course you can’t ship anything by train to Puerto Rico.', 'The Jones Act survives because it prevents a handful of US shipbuilding and merchant shipping operations from going out of business, and nobody else with political clout really cares.', 'But the executive branch has the authority to waive the act in special circumstances, as it has done in the past whenever the downside of making it excessively expensive to ship American goods from one place in America to another becomes a high-profile issue.', 'As Keith Hennessey, formerly the top economic adviser to President Bush, recounted in a 2010 blog post, the politics of Jones Act waivers are difficult. Emergency waivers in rare periods of spiking demand don’t put anyone out of business, but they still do have a long-term cost for the industry. If American-owned ships could count on windfall profits derived from price gouging arising every time a hurricane causes acute fuel shortages in a coastal location, that would support the creation of a slightly larger stock of domestic boats.', 'When considering the Katrina waivers, Hennessey recounts, “the pushback was not just from maritime unions, but also from the U.S.-flagged shipping industry, including shippers and shipbuilders, and including Rs and Ds on Capitol Hill who were close to the industry.”', 'At the end of the day, “without a strong lean from President Bush on his Cabinet to ‘do everything we can,’ the waivers would not have happened,” given the intensity of the political pushback.', 'Of course, one advantage that residents of Louisiana, Texas, and New Jersey have had in seeking Jones Act waivers is that they are represented in Congress by senators and House members.

Puerto Rico, in particular, is so close to the United States that the most cost-effective way to transport many goods there would be for ships to stop off en route to a mainland port. But under the Jones Act, foreign-originating goods must be dropped off in Jacksonville and then shipped to Puerto Rico via an exorbitantly expensive Jones-compliant vessel. Likewise, it costs far more to ship US-produced goods to Puerto Rico than it does to Jamaica.', 'This raises the cost of living on Puerto Rico, makes Puerto Rico an unattractive place to produce goods bound for the US mainland, and has the bizarre effect of putting Puerto Rico at a competitive disadvantage to other Caribbean islands as a destination for American tourists.', 'In the US Virgin Islands, which are exempt from the law, US-made goods are about half as expensive, while the cost of living in Puerto Rico is 13 percent higher than on the American mainland. Food on Puerto Rico costs twice as much as it does in Florida, and that’s before the devastation of the island’s agriculture by Hurricane Maria.', 'In the short term, the Trump administration should issue a broad temporary waiver of the Jones Act so that supplies could more easily reach Puerto Rico from the American mainland. While the American people will likely be generous with their charitable contributions of both money and supplies, it’s fairly perverse to have a healthy chunk of that generosity soaked up by monopolist shipowners rather than going to the actual delivery of food and medicine to people in need.', 'But the Jones Act relief shouldn’t stop there.', 'Unlike Houston, Puerto Rico isn’t a thriving place that happens to have been hit by a serious natural disaster. It’s a poor place by American standards whose economy has been in shambles for about a decade and whose bankrupt government is now hamstrung by its creditors. It badly needs an overall improvement in economic conditions — some kind of prospect for long-term growth — and permanently lifting the Jones Act is one of the more powerful levers at federal disposal for doing that. Reducing the cost of living on the island will make it a more attractive destination for tourism and retirees, while giving the island at least some shot of developing export industries and raising living standards for residents.', 'This could, of course, be achieved by simply repealing the Jones Act, as Sen. John McCain has proposed several times, most recently in July.', 'If that’s too much for the shipbuilding industry to swallow, a narrow law exempting Puerto Rico from its reach could be a helpful idea. Alternatively, a midsize law that would narrow the Jones Act to the contiguous 48 states might pick up the congressional delegations of Alaska and Hawaii as champions while lifting Puerto Rico incidentally.', 'But the risk for the island is that while the immediate devastation of Hurricane Maria is leading to a brief surge in attention, the subject of maritime regulation will likely soon slip back into its customary obscurity — dragging down Puerto Rico’s economy more out of indifference than malice.']"

30,Navy’s costly — and controversial — Zumwalt ship may get second look by Trump,2016-12-01T14:49:45+0000,"['  With breakdowns and growing costs, the U.S. Navy’s most expensive  destroyer ever is likely to face added scrutiny by the incoming  Trump administration and could see its future role  minimized. ', '  The USS Zumwalt, a stealth ship commissioned in October and  costing upward of $4.4 billion, has already had engineering and  propulsion problems and experienced a breakdown last week when it  passed through a portion of the Panama Canal. It was delivered  about two years late and despite its stealthy qualities is seen  by some as vulnerable and no longer suitable for the missions it  was designed to handle.', '  “Since they originally started to build the ship, the threat  environment has changed so that cruise missiles can easily reach  out and hit anybody that’s out there close enough to use a gun to  hit the shore,” said Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Center  for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, an independent policy  research institute based in Washington, D.C.', '  Clark, a former aide to the chief of naval operations, explained  that the Zumwalt-class destroyer was originally designed for  operating close to shore such as acting as support for Marines when they land on shore. “That mission sort of fell away  [and now the ship is] too vulnerable and too valuable to have  them get so close to shore.” ', '  The Navy plans to get two more of the Zumwalt-class guided  missile destroyers, which are equipped with labor-saving  technology and manufactured by General Dynamics’  Bath Iron Works in Maine. But its fate will ultimately rest with  President-elect Donald Trump,  who has made expansion of the Navy part of his plan to strengthen the military. ', '  A General Dynamics Bath Iron Works spokesman deferred questions  on the destroyer to the Navy, which did not respond at  deadline.', '  The Pentagon originally had hoped to get 32 of the Zumwalt-class  warships but backed off the plan more than a decade ago after  congressional criticism about costs. ', '  Adding to the concerns is the huge cost of ammunition for the  Zumwalt’s on-board advanced guns made by BAE Systems, which  can run upward of $1 million apiece, according to some reports.  That means the each round of the guided precision ammo is  equivalent to the cost of a Tomahawk or a Boeing Harpoon  missile. ', '  “The ammunition is definitely an issue,” said Benjamin Freeman,  deputy director of the National Security Program at Third Way, a  Washington-based think tank. “Frankly it’s unsustainable for the  Navy. At almost $1 million a shot, that’s not actually something  that they can do.”', 'The Zumwalt ship and its class of destroyers, also known as DDG 1000, was named for the  late Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Elmo Zumwalt. The destroyer’s 155-millimeter guns were designed to use so-called  Long Range Land-Attack Projectiles, or LRLAPs, made by Lockheed  Martin. Around 90 LRLAPs were bought for the Zumwalt,  including some for testing.', '  “As the DDG 1000′s mission continues to evolve, and taking into  consideration funding profiles available to support the  weaponization of the ship in light of the severe reduction in the  planned production quantities, the U.S. Navy decided to evaluate  alternate solutions to LRLAP,” a Lockheed Martin spokesperson  said in an email statement. “Lockheed Martin is working  aggressively to provide the Navy with options in relation to the  DDG-1000′s long-range land attack mission.”', '  Purchases of around 2,000 projectiles to supply all three  Zumwalt-class destroyers would likely exceed $1.8 billion. That  is in addition to the Zumwalt-class development costs, which have  already reached roughly $10 billion.', '  Meantime, the USS Zumwalt warship is expected to arrive in San  Diego by the end of the year and a decision on new ammunition for  the ship’s big guns is likely to be made by the Trump  administration.', 'Trump’s defense plan outlined in September called for up to 350  surface ships and submarines, up from 276 today and above the  Pentagon’s current target of 308 ships over the next 10  years. That said, Trump hasn’t specified plans for destroyer warships  and could revisit the Navy’s decision to buy three of the  Zumwalt-class destroyers.', '  Today, the Navy has around 80 destroyers and cruiser ships and  Clark suggests there’s a greater need to build smaller surface  combatants like patrol ships, missile craft and frigates. He said  a fleet architecture study the center completed for the Navy  concluded the fleet size doesn’t necessarily need to be bigger  across the board.', '  “It’s sort of a rebalancing of the Navy towards a larger and more  distributed fleet of smaller platforms as opposed to what we have  today, which is a smaller fleet of really large, expensive,  multimission platforms,” said Clark. “And the Zumwalt is a  perfect example of that expense.”', '  According to Clark, the Zumwalt ships appear destined to get used  mostly as a technology demonstration platform for the Navy. That  would allow the Navy to experiment with the destroyer’s  next-generation technology, which features all-electric systems  that can distribute power for everything from the propulsion  system to on-board laser guns that can destroy targets for a  fraction of the cost of conventional weaponry. ', '  Indeed, some suggest the older Arleigh Burke-class destroyers  made by Huntington Ingalls  Industries still provide a formidable platform for  firepower and can be enhanced with next-generation upgrades. The  Navy is currently building two Arleigh Burke-class destroyers per  year and Clark believes the Trump administration could ramp that  up to three to four “relatively easily.”', '  “HII stands ready to support our customers’ shipbuilding  requirements, and will leverage our hot production lines and our  suppliers in 48 states to build the ships that our nation  requires,” Huntington Ingalls said in a statement provided to  CNBC.', '  While the Zumwalt-class destroyer costs more than $4 billion, the  Arleigh Burke-class warships run about $1.3 billion apiece.  Huntington Ingalls has built and delivered 28 DDG 51 (or Arleigh  Burke-class destroyers) and has contracts for seven more.', '  Still, some believe the Zumwalt should have a bigger role as  Trump looks to build a 350-ship Navy. They contend that the older  destroyers lack the power bandwidth for some of the  energy-intensive futuristic weapons such as the electromagnetic  rail gun and lasers. ', '  “My concern is that the Trump administration ... would continue  to buy the antiquated technology just to get ships in slots to  that 350 number,” said Freeman, a long-term proponent of the  Zumwalt class.', '  While the upfront costs of the Zumwalt-class destroyers are  higher, Freeman contends there’s a longer-term savings for the  Navy going with the next-generation warships over the older  Arleigh Burke-class. He insists the lifetime costs of going with  newer-class destroyer technology is “at least equal” if not  ultimately lower than the older class.', '  “If you can pay a little money now to get a better ship, then  that will be cheaper to operate in the long run and we should do  that,” said Freeman. Moreover, he said he expects the Navy will  eventually lower the cost of the 155-millimeter projectiles and  can increase the use of Zumwalt’s laser electric weaponry.']"

The staffer then handed back the bottle opener, along with a beer.', 'Inside, Facebook employees got to see early versions of Portal as well as other experiments like a brain-computer interface designed to allow humans to mind-control a device, and Project Sequoia, an augmented reality adventure resembling the hologram-like computers in “Iron Man” movies.', 'But as employees marveled at Building 8′s creations, tensions were beginning to brew. Some staffers resented Building 8′s secretiveness — to enter the space you needed an escort. The group was spending lavishly, shelling out over $100 million a year on vendors, consultants and show-off events, according to two former executives.', 'There were also internal struggles. People who came from the hardware industry were shocked by Facebook’s unrealistic production timeline. The company expected Building 8 to ship its first product within a year, a fraction of the time it normally takes to develop hardware devices, former employees said. A Facebook spokeswoman disputed that fact and said Building 8 was not expected to ship products within that timeframe.', 'And then there was the Facebook stigma. Following the company’s role in enabling the spread of disinformation in the 2016 election, the team knew it faced a massive public trust and privacy problem.', 'Dugan’s pace of progress was a key source of friction between Building 8 and its parent company. She was working on two-year timelines, but in Aug. 2017, Facebook made a decision designed to speed things up.', 'Schroepfer announced that Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, a longtime vice president who had run the company’s ads and business team, would manage consumer hardware, including Oculus and Building 8. Bosworth was a Zuckerberg loyalist, having joined the company in 2006, but he had no experience in hardware.', 'As it turned out, that decision spelled the beginning of the end for Dugan. Less than two months later, she announced her sudden departure. Dugan’s former colleagues say it’s unclear if she was fired or quit, but over the following weeks many of her deputies followed her out the door.', 'Bosworth named Rafa Camargo, who had followed Dugan from ATAP, as the interim head. When it came to technological decisions, Bosworth offered little direction, former employees said.', 'Camargo told CNBC in an interview that Bosworth’s contributions are significant and that he’s responsible for the hardware, software, marketing, go-to market and manufacturing decisions behind all of the devices Facebook has released since the Oculus Go in May 2018.', '“It’s super difficult to launch products on time, in quality, in volume and in need of the market, and he’s leading it all,” Camargo said.', 'Amid Building 8′s turmoil, by early 2018 Facebook had a more existential problem on its hands that derailed any chance the company had of getting Portal to market on its accelerated timeline.', 'In March of that year, multiple publications reported that Cambridge Analytica, a London-based political consulting firm, had improperly accessed the data of up to 87 million Facebook users, a scandal that would send the company’s stock spiraling downward and ultimately lead Zuckerberg to turn his attention to creating a “privacy-focused social platform.”', 'Within days, Bosworth told his team that Facebook had hit a low in terms of user trust and said it wasn’t the right time for Portal. He didn’t offer a projected launch date, and said the team was going to rethink the design.', 'Facebook’s spokeswoman told CNBC that Portal launched on schedule as the company’s plan was always to release the product in the fall of 2018. Multiple former Building 8 employees said the rollout was delayed numerous times.', 'Facebook finally released two Portal video-chatting devices in November, with the addition of camera covers so users could block the lens.', 'Portal immediately hit privacy snags. A week after telling Recode that no data collected by Portal would be used to target Facebook users with ads, the company walked back the statement and said that because Portal’s software was built on Facebook’s Messenger infrastructure, it collected the same type of type of data and could potentially be used to inform ads.', 'A month after the release, Camargo announced that Building 8 was no more and the group would now be known as Portal. In early 2018, the remaining research projects were moved to Oculus Research, which has since been rebranded as Facebook Reality Labs, based in Redmond, Washington.

Amazon has added roughly double the amount of distribution space Home Depot currently owns.', '', 'That means the company has a huge head start in fulfilling its plan laid out in its latest earnings report to shorten the current two-day free shipping plan by one day for Prime members, who pay $119 a year for fast delivery as well as services like unlimited music, access to the video catalog and exclusive deals.', '“We see Amazon’s 1-day Prime shipping raising consumer expectations and increasing the cost to compete in e-commerce,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note after the announcement.', 'The map below from RBC shows the four-year change in Amazon’s distribution footprint. It already covers most of the coastal cities, as well as Texas and major metropolitan areas in the Midwest.', '“While store-level distribution is still the fastest way for a consumer to acquire a product, Amazon’s continued rollout of same-day and next-day delivery capabilities continues to reduce that historical competitive barrier and represents a growing risk to retailers who are too often fighting yesterday’s (2-day) delivery wars,” RBC Capital wrote in the note.', 'Following the Amazon announcement, RBC said in another report that “the faster you ship, the more people buy.”', 'One of the biggest reasons people shop at a physical store is because of the immediate need to get a product. By shortening delivery time to one day, Amazon changes that equation. Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s CFO, said on the first-quarter earnings call that the company is already starting to see “good order trends” after rolling out one-day default shipping to certain areas.', 'It’s having an impact on the stock market, too. Rival retailers, like Walmart and Target, saw their shares drop following Amazon’s announcement. Most retailers are just now starting to offer two-day shipping and will be forced to spend more on improving their logistics infrastructure to try and keep pace with Amazon.', 'Even at Amazon, the change won’t come cheap. The company said it’s planning to spend $800 million during this quarter alone to expand one-day shipping. RBC noted that 15 U.S. states still don’t have access to Amazon’s same-day or next-day delivery, so the company will have to spend more heavily to reach those areas.', '', '“While this is a drag on profitability near term, we believe enhancements like this should encourage incremental spending by customers and attract new Prime members,” BMO Capital wrote in a note following Amazon’s earnings.', 'Another benefit is improvements in warehouse efficiency. Since products are shipped faster, more inventory will move in and out of Amazon’s fulfillment centers more quickly.', '“The long-term benefit is that turnover will be faster in the warehouse so efficiency can be gained for fulfillment as a percentage of revenues,” Mizuho Securities wrote in a recent note.', 'WATCH: Buffett says Berkshire Hathaway has been buying Amazon']"
34,How this shipping container business is attempting to flip the construction industry on its head,2018-10-18T13:00:56+0000,"['Homeowners in hurricane- and tornado-prone areas now have an alternative to traditional brick and wood structures to keep their families safe: shipping containers. Their unibody steel construction exceeds structural code in the U.S. and stands up to severe conditions in seismic zones. One leader in the space is Brooklyn-based SG Blocks.', 'Founded in 2007, SG Blocks repurposes some of the 20 million or so containers in the world as its primary building tool. It calls itself a one-stop-shop construction platform for consumers looking for longer-lasting, greener, less-expensive dwellings.', 'SG Blocks manages the project from start to finish and provides industry-approved, code-engineered cargo shipping containers and complete architectural, engineering and design. Once the foundation is in and approved, SG Blocks delivers the home approximately 90 days later.', '“The beautiful thing about prefabricated construction with SG Blocks is that while your contractor is doing the hole in the ground and the utilities, we’re at the same exact time modifying the modules so that on Friday your foundation is finished and then on Monday, instead of having your general contractor show up for his first day, we start delivering 1,000 square feet an hour,” said Paul Galvin, chairman and CEO of SG Blocks.', 'In March 2017 SG Blocks became the first company to receive an ESR number for a recycled material to be approved for construction. This basically makes the shipping container the equivalent of a brick or a piece of wood for construction purposes. Since then, this type of construction has exploded.', '“Up until last year it was done on a one-off basis until SG Blocks and our team of engineers were able to get that as an approved mainstream building product, and since that time, we have a backlog of over 100 million contracts that have to be delivered upon, and our pipeline exceeds 300 million opportunities,” said Galvin.', 'More from Business of Design:', '7 new RV models taking the classic vehicle to a new level', 'Tiny homes offer a breathtaking retreat', 'For 25 years Galvin’s experience was working on homelessness and homeless AIDS housing in New York City through a nonprofit he founded. He said quality, costs and delays associated with traditional construction were frustrating and have not changed.', 'SG Blocks is working toward giving everyone their fair chance of reaching the American dream. In 2018 the company announced a partnership with Capital Plus. Capital Plus is heavily invested in first-time ownership in the Hispanic community. The partners are doing a test case for a 50-year mortgage for a container-based project, which will make owning a home more attainable.', 'Galvin also talks about plan densification. That allows a purchaser to right-size their home. A new couple or small family may only need, or have enough money for, a 950-foot container-based structure. It could be built and prepped for expansion behind the walls so when the family grows, it won’t take six months to renovate. It could be expanded by adding a container on top or next to it with minimal disruption to the community or your family.', '“The challenge for people living in America is that we have a very vulnerable housing class right now — whether it’s people living on limited incomes or fixed incomes. Many of them are forced to live in areas where there are persistent climate threats from the ocean, tornadoes and hurricanes. What we’re interested in is housing families in steel structures rather than wood structures and putting people in really safe environments that are both sustainable and longer-lasting,” said Galvin.', 'According to SG Blocks, the cost for a container ranges from $2,500 to $5,000. And in terms of retrofitting and the price of the final product, a container-based building is about 10 percent less expensive than  traditional construction and up to 50 percent faster. Finally, the company claims there is also a time-saving factor, and with faster construction, there could be faster and better return on investment.', 'Galvin is taking part in rebuilding Puerto Rico one year after devastating hurricanes Irma and María. His company is delivering already-built, storm-resistant structures to Puerto Rico. Eventually, SG Blocks will deliver structures, erect them on the island and have local contractors and laborers do the finish work on the inside.', 'In September, SG Blocks announced the formation of Sequential Modular Partners. SG Blocks will be the exclusive product supplier to Sequential in the joint venture. This will allow SG Blocks to apply for corporate, government and private businesses set aside for minorities in modular construction.', '“We’re creating business opportunities for communities of color and much-needed housing and schools all over the world, taking disadvantaged groups, marginalized groups and breaking down barriers so they can get their participation in the American dream,” said Galvin.', 'The company has completed projects for the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy, U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs, the City of Santa Monica, Equinox and more.', 'SG, which stands for safe and green, trades on the Nasdaq under ticker symbol SGBX.

Now, as many retailers panic over supply chain chaos, Amazon’s costly early moves are helping it avoid the long wait times for available dock space and workers at the country’s busiest ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles. ', '“Los Angeles, there’s 79 vessels sitting out there up to 45 days waiting to come into the harbor,” ocean freight analyst Steve Ferreira told CNBC in November.  “Amazon’s latest venture that I’ve been tracking in the last two days, it waited two days in the harbor.”', 'By chartering private cargo vessels to carry its goods, Amazon can control where its goods go, avoiding the most congested ports.', '“Who else would think of putting something going into an obscure port in Washington, and then trucking it down to L.A.? Most people are thinking, well, just bring the ship into L.A. But then you’re experiencing those two-week and three-weeks delay. So Amazon’s really taken advantage of some of the niche strategies I believe that the market needs to employ,” Ferreira said.', 'Still, Amazon has seen a 14% rise in out-of-stock items and an average price increase of 25% since January 2021, according to e-commerce management platform CommerceIQ.', '“The consumer has been feeling price increases in everything that they’re purchasing,” said Margaret Kidd, Supply Chain & Logistics Technology program director at the University of Houston. “Ultimately, when there’s an increase in the cost of transportation, it gets passed down to the consumer.”', 'Amazon has been on a spending spree to control as much of the shipping process as possible. It spent more than $61 billion on shipping in 2020, up from just under $38 billion in 2019. Now, Amazon is shipping 72% of its own packages, up from less than 47% in 2019 according to SJ Consulting Group.', 'It’s even taking control at the first step of the shipping journey by making its own 53-foot cargo containers in China. Containers are in short supply, with long wait times and prices surging from less than $2,000 before the pandemic to $20,000 today.', '“Amazon has produced probably 5,000 to 10,000 of these containers over the last two years I’ve been tracking it,” Ferreira said. “When they bring these containers onto U.S. soil, once they unload them, guess what? They get to be used in the domestic system and the rail system. They don’t have to return them to Asia like everyone else does.”', 'A cargo vessel called the Star Lygra called at the Port of Houston on October 5, 2021, filled with Amazon containers.', '“By creating their own containers, they are essentially guaranteeing that equipment is going to be available for them,” said Lauren Beagen, maritime lawyer and founder of Squall Strategies. She was working at the Federal Maritime Commission when Amazon first registered with the agency in 2015, the first indication it was exploring its own ocean freight business. ', 'Then in 2017, Amazon started quietly operating as a global freight forwarder through a Chinese subsidiary, helping move goods across the ocean for its Chinese sellers who pay to be part of the Fulfilled by Amazon program. Internally, Amazon dubbed this project “Dragon Boat.” ', '“They are doing over 10,000 containers per month of the small- and medium-sized Chinese exporters. Amazon’s volume as an ocean vendor — that’s right, you heard me correct, they’re considered an ocean vendor — would rank them in the top five transportation companies in the Trans Pacific,” Ferreira said.', 'This season, a handful of other major retailers — Walmart, Costco, Home Depot, Ikea and Target — are also chartering their own vessels to bypass the busiest ports and get their goods unloaded sooner.', '“The real purpose of these vessels when they were built was not containers. It was really lumber, chemicals, grain, agricultural products. But because of the ingenuity and creativity and lack of space, Amazon and many other smart people have quickly figured out how to convert some of these multipurpose vessels to container,” Ferreira said.', 'For some of the highest-margin goods, Amazon is avoiding ports altogether by reportedly leasing at least ten long-haul planes that can get smaller amounts of cargo directly from China to the U.S. much faster. One of the converted Boeing 777 planes can carry 220,000 pounds of cargo. According to capacity estimates from Ocean Audit, the small 1,000-container freighters being chartered by Amazon and others can hold 180 times that, with the biggest cargo ships carrying more than 3,600 times what the planes can hold.', 'Another strain on the supply chain is manpower.

Last year, it hired 100,000 seasonal workers.', '“That 50,000 increase in employees this year over last year is probably people to do the unloads.

The air force and navy forces could potentially be used to conduct a blockade of Taiwan.', '“They keep saying that, ‘we have to be prepared to retake Taiwan,’” said Cheng. “But they’ve never really invested in the naval infantry, over-the-shore capabilities that would be required. Now we’re seeing them do it as almost the last block being put in place.”', 'At the same time, there have been reports of Chinese military movements near Japan and South Korea in the past month, including five Chinese military planes moving off the coast of South Korea.', 'Also, a Chinese submarine was reported off Japan this week, according to Japanese reports. One of the locations where the submarine was tracked was near the disputed Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea.', 'The so-called Type 071 landing ship the Chinese developed is believed to be just under 30,000 tons and could carry helicopters as well as troops from the People’s Liberation Army. Attack helicopters also could be used to as part of an invasion scenario in Taiwan.', 'According to Roy, Beijing is believed to have the capability today with its existing ships to send about 20,000 troops to Taiwan.', 'Then again, experts said the amphibious ships also could be use for peaceful purposes by the Chinese, including to evacuate people during disaster response situations. Indeed, the U.S. has used amphibious ships in the past year for hurricane and flooding relief missions.']"

And gasoline prices about 30 percent higher than the same point last year, AAA says.', 'The price spike will be a test for the e-commerce giant, which raised the annual price of Prime membership this spring to $119 from $99 for new members, citing rising costs. Amazon held its first Prime Day in the summer of 2015 to celebrate the company’s 20th anniversary, and at that point fuel prices then were cratering amid a global glut. The major perk of Amazon Prime is free two-day shipping.', 'The event will also test the idea of a massive, mid-summer sale, which hits during a time of strong fuel demand in the midst of the busy summer driving and air travel season. Amazon isn’t alone in the summer shopping frenzy. Competitors like Macy’s, Walmart and Kohl’s are offering their Black Friday-style deals in hopes of getting an off-season windfall from deals-hungry consumers.', 'Consumers can breathe a sigh of relief about the higher fuel costs, at least for now.', '“There would be an impact to Amazon’s costs but you wouldn’t see it in the short term because you are a Prime customer and don’t pay shipping,” said Peter Guarraia, who heads Bain & Co.’s supply chain consulting team.', 'The United States Postal Service has the capacity to handle “projected surges in volume” but declined to comment on the impact of fuel prices.', 'Companies like FedEx and UPS that ship and deliver packages for Amazon can somewhat offset the cost of pricier fuel with surcharges.', '“Packages shipped as part of a special promotion carry the same surcharge as any other shipment,” said UPS spokesman Jim Mayer.', 'These companies are now competing more with Amazon itself, which is building out its own logistics network, with fleets of trucks, vans and planes.

Atlas Air does not hedge fuel and under wet leasing agreements, in which a crew, maintenance and other services are provided, and dry leasing agreements has “no direct fuel price exposure because our customers are required to pay for aircraft fuel,” said spokeswoman Beth Roach.', 'Amazon last month said it wants to build a network of entrepreneurs who would provide last-mile delivery for the company’s customers. Those individuals would have to pay for fuel, but Amazon said it would offer discounts.', 'While it will likely pale compared with the busy, and more spread out, end-of-year holiday shopping season, Prime Day is moving the needle in terms of demand.', '“Prime Day was created specifically to artificially manufacture demand during a lackluster period so capacity is not particularly strained,” said Zvi Schreiber, CEO of Freightos, an online platform where companies can book space on cargo planes and compare rates. “That said, Amazon’s sale schedule has gotten traction. We did see a 25 percent increase in shipments to [Amazon fulfillment centers] in the month leading up to Prime Day.”']"

The reports come amid increasing threats from nuclear-armed North Korea and as China modernizes its armed forces and demonstrates growing maritime ambitions in the region.', '“The F-35 can be considered both a deterrent and also carry the fight to a potential adversary,” said Seth Cropsey, a former deputy undersecretary of the Navy in the Reagan and Bush administrations and now a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.', 'The so-called jump-jet stealth F-35B fighter could add more firepower for the U.S. allies and potentially help find, track and attack enemy aircraft and missiles as well as perhaps conduct strike missions deep inside North Korea, according to experts. To be clear, other surveillance assets also would likely be used to support attacks in enemy territory.', 'Japan and South Korea are among the 13 countries involved with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, which has three variants — the U.S. Air Force’s F-35A (conventional takeoff and landing version), the F-35B (the U.S. Marine Corps variant that can land without conventional runways) and the F-35C (the U.S. Navy version with larger wings, special landing gear for aircraft carriers and greater fuel capacity).', 'Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program.', 'John Pike, a military analyst at Globalsecurity.org, said the F-35B would give the South Koreans stronger fleet air defenses and formidable ship-to-shore ground attack capabilities “that you wouldn’t want to mess with.”', 'Furthermore, he said, putting the versatile fighter on a mobile platform at sea would make it harder to destroy than if the plane were at an airfield.', 'Japan reportedly wants to use the F-35B, a fifth-generation fighter costing more than $100 million apiece, for its Izumo-class helicopter carriers, the country’s Kyodo news agency reported this week. ', 'Japan’s reported interest in using warships to launch the F-35B isn’t sitting well with Beijing, which this year went operational with its own fifth-generation fighter with stealth capabilities. China also is preparing to move forward with its third aircraft carrier and has an advanced “carrier-killer” missile capable of threatening U.S. aircraft carriers in the Asia-Pacific region.', '“We urge Japan to do more that may help enhance mutual trust and promote regional peace and stability,” Hua Chunying, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, was quoted as saying Tuesday in state media. She also said such actions by Tokyo would violate Article 9 of Japan’s 1946 constitution, which renounces war and technically the use of force.', 'Regardless, Tokyo has seen tensions increase in recent years with Beijing due to maritime disputes, including over islands in the East China Sea and the communist country’s aggressive actions in the South China Sea. As a result, the Japanese Maritime Self-Defence Force has been rethinking its security strategy and strengthening its capabilities.', 'Experts expect China to continue building up its military forces in the South China Sea in 2018, adding to bases, radar and weapons capabilities on several artificial islands. The new U.S. National Security Strategy released last week by President Donald Trump stated that China’s “efforts to build and militarize outposts in the South China Sea endanger the free flow of trade, threaten the sovereignty of other nations, and undermine regional stability.”', 'At present, Japan only has the F-35A — the conventional takeoff and landing variant — but is considering whether to purchase the F-35B fighter. Japan took delivery of its first F-35A in 2016 and is assembling more than three dozen others domestically at a facility in the Nagoya area.', 'Meantime, South Korea also is looking at the F-35B for use aboard a roughly 14,000-ton warship scheduled to get deployed in 2020. The plan would be to essentially refit the so-called Dokdo-class vessel to become medium-sized aircraft carrier. Seoul already has a Dokdo-class amphibious assault ship in operation.', '“I understand that the military top brass have recently discussed whether they can introduce a small number of F-35B fighters and operate them aboard the new ship that has already been deployed and one to be additionally built,” South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency reported this week, quoting an unidentified military source.', 'According to the source, Seoul is considering the stealth fighter as part of “maximizing the strategic value” of its newest amphibious landing ships.', 'South Korea already has agreed to buy 40 F-35As and expects to deploy the first ones next year. The Seoul government also is reportedly looking at adding the F-35B to its planned purchases of aircraft over the next several years.', 'Cropsey said the F-35B, though, should be viewed as part of a larger defense strategy and not in isolation.', '“As a weapon in the toolbox it’s a good one,” the former Pentagon official said. “But for as good a plane as it is, there’s no assurance of getting all the targets. There’s no assurance that the planes can get through the air defenses or that the strikes against the targets will come in time.”', 'Pike, however, is optimistic about the F-35′s stealth capabilities being able to penetrate North Korea air defenses.', '“I just don’t think that North Korea’s air defenses are much to worry about,” said Pike. “As far as the stealth fighter is concerned, it would be like a hot knife through butter.”', 'Pike said the F-35B could attack ballistic missiles on the ground in North Korea, especially since Pyongyang has been relying mostly on liquid fuel for missiles — and that fueling process can take time and slows down launch time.', 'Some also have suggested the advanced sensors and air-to-air missiles on the stealth fighter could be capable of killing ballistic missiles launched during the boost phase. Experts suggest that the scenario may not be entirely practical and that it would make more sense to take out the missile before it’s launched.', 'Either way, shooting down a North Korean missile on the launch vehicle or in the boost phase comes with huge risks. It could spark a bloody war with the North firing rockets into the greater Seoul area, where about half of the South Korean population lives. And, there’s a chance the regime could use chemical weapons or even launch nuclear-tipped missiles.', 'Last month, North Korea test-launched its new intercontinental ballistic missile, the Kwasong-15, from a so-called transporter-erector-launcher (TEL). The missile range and height appear to have showed that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has an ICBM capable of reaching most, if not all of, the United States.', 'The “window of vulnerability” happens before the ballistic missile gets fired from the launchers, which are essentially timber trucks converted to carry and launch weapons. The ballistic missiles on these launchers must be first lifted into an upfront firing position before the liquid fuel can be loaded. That could take an hour os so, experts said.', 'Pike is confident the U.S. and its Asian allies could monitor large swaths of North Korea’s flat terrain where the TEL missiles could possibly be launched and spot something “pretty quick.” Signs of an ICBM or another ballistic missile launch would in part come from “a caravan” of vehicles, including fuel trucks, as they move toward the TEL with the missile, the analyst said.', '“We cannot assume that we’re going to see a 12-vehicle convey strung out on a highway coming out of a tunnel, all nice and lined up,” said Pike. “That would be too easy. The elements of the convoy are going to be dispersed, and you will have a ‘flash mob’ of a dozen vehicles converging simultaneously at a pre-arranged location. So it’s only when the ‘flash mob’ assembles that the ‘kill chain’ will perk up.”']"

It’s not just dresses, it’s tailoring, it’s knitwear, it’s a complete wardrobe, plus accessories as well. So I’ve learnt a lot from my team and I’ve learnt a lot about the business.

Neo Investment Partners put £30 million ($39.3 million) into the business in November 2017 and Beckham plans to open more shops.', '“This is a start of a new chapter. I’ve bought on investors, I’ve got a new CEO that started two weeks ago, there is so much that I want to do to really put my foot on the gas. You know, I’m building my team, spending a lot of time focusing on the digital side of things… so it really is building the brand and taking it to the next level, which I’m going to be able to do now that I have the right people around me,” she added.', 'Beckham hinted that a skincare and makeup line are in the works, after running a makeup collaboration with Estee Lauder.', 'Staying independent is important to Beckham, as is being able to sell direct to consumers. When asked by Bryer about the current retail climate, she said: “There’s always going to be challenges. For me, being able to communicate directly with my customer and (that) she can just get what she wants from the shopping experience, (that it) can be enjoyable and it can be fast and she can get what she wants quickly. That is key for me.”', 'Beckham is starring in a series of ads to celebrate her fashion line.

Prices for consumer and wholesale goods are soaring. The trends are expected to create an inflationary holiday season with the potential for fewer goods under Christmas trees.', 'Those looking for good shipping news anytime soon aren’t likely to receive it.', '“Backlogs and elevated shipping costs are likely to persist at least through the middle of next year because no immediate solution for the underlying supply-demand imbalance at US ports is available,” Goldman economist Ronnie Walker said in a note to clients.', 'Relief could arrive eventually. The pressures “should soon begin to ease” but only “slightly as we pass the ongoing seasonal peak in shipping demand ahead of the holiday season,” Walker added. The problems should lessen after the holidays and Lunar New Year as container traffic wanes.', 'In the meantime, consumers will pay more and have access to less.', 'Shipping a container through major U.S. ports now takes triple the time it normally does. In September, about one-third of containers at the L.A. and Long Beach ports sat longer than five days before being shipped out, according to Goldman Sachs. Offloaded containers dropped by 9.1% at Long Beach and 3.6% at Los Angeles.', 'President Joe Biden tried to fix the problem by ordering ports to stay open 24 hours, but it has only helped at the margins. Ongoing labor shortages and a lack of coordination among the multiple players in the U.S. supply chain blunted the effect of the move.', '“The upshot is that the outlook offers no immediate fixes for the underlying supply-demand imbalance at US ports,” Walker wrote.', 'Though he sees some easing ahead, he added that “congestion will likely persist to some extent through at least the middle of next year, and our analysts expect that freight rates will likely remain meaningfully above pre-pandemic levels for at least the next year.”', 'Companies have had to find ways to keep their products moving amid the supply chain disruptions.', 'The issue has been mentioned repeatedly during the third-quarter earnings season.

A system with underlying chaotic characteristics can swing from calm to chaos very quickly, with few warning signs,” Pantheon Macroeconomics Ian Shepherdson wrote.', 'Still, Shepherdson expects the pendulum to swing back to more of a services-based economy, allowing supply to catch up to demand. Federal Reserve officials are betting on that outcome as well. They have decided against raising interest rates to stave off inflation, hoping that the economy returns soon to equilibrium.', 'Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday that inflation has lasted longer than he expected and likely will persist into next year. But he added that it has not risen to a level that warrants substantial policy tightening.', 'Shepherdson said a drop in demand could lead to “a period of rapid declines in goods prices,” though he added that he would “be surprised to see that before the middle of next year.”']"

And in 2016, Ruffin launched Amazon Air, a dedicated cargo network that would directly rival shipping shipping giants UPS and FedEx.', 'Before Amazon Air, Ruffin had an early role in developing Amazon’s sortation centers, the facilities that allow the company to better control a package’s journey to a shopper’s doorstep and to speed up the process.', 'Now that he’s seen the complicated nature of logistics for online retailers, Ruffin wants to help smaller companies navigate the world of sorting, packing and shipping. In February, his logistics start-up Pandion, located near Amazon’s Seattle headquarters, came out of stealth mode with a $4.9 million round of seed funding.', 'Pandion said Tuesday it raised another $30 million from investors, including AME Cloud Ventures, a firm led by Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang, and Innovation Endeavors, co-founded by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt.', 'Bow Capital led the round. Rafi Syed, the firm’s general partner, said Pandion is designed for the modern challenges of online retail and to meet surging demand, which is overloading the existing shipping system.', '“The incumbent shippers weren’t built for e-commerce, and shoppers often feel the strain through delayed deliveries, missing packages, and poor customer experience,” Syed said in a statement.', 'U.S. consumers are projected to spend $933.3 billion online this year, up 17.9% from 2020, according to eMarketer. Amazon is expected to account for 40% of that.', 'Pandion is going after the other 60%, and has already signed up a number of retailers, including multiple Fortune 100 companies, Ruffin said.', 'The company is building a network of warehouses for online retailers, with its first sortation center opening in the coming months. The new 150,000-square-foot site in Quakertown, Pennsylvania, will help major retailers offer low-cost, reliable two-day deliveries in the U.S. Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions, an area Ruffin said covers up to 45 million people.', '“You’re talking a pretty good chunk of the U.S. population,” said Ruffin, who briefly led Walmart’s e-commerce transportation division after leaving Amazon in 2017.', 'FedEx and UPS can only provide so much shipping capacity. They deliver to 40 million addresses, five days a week, while current e-commerce volume requires deliveries to 160 million addresses, seven days a week, Ruffin said.', 'Pandion aims to operate 20 sorting centers within the next three to four years. By comparison, Amazon has at least 69 such facilities in the U.S., according to a September tally by MWPVL International, a supply chain and logistics consulting firm. Target has been testing a sortation center in Minnesota and plans to open five more by the end of the fiscal year.', 'Sortation centers are designed to cut down on shipping times by organizing packages and bundling them by ZIP code, before loading them onto trucks for transport to a last-mile delivery station, like a U.S. Postal Service site. Through that process, the shipping center doesn’t have to sort the packages before delivering them to consumers.', 'In addition to investing in its own facilities, Pandion has developed software so it can spot potential hiccups in its shipping network and reroute packages to another facility. That makes its system more flexible than those operated by the big shippers, which set rigid pathways that determine where packages go from the warehouse.', 'Ruffin said it’s like an airplane’s flight plan.', '“Amazon, UPS, FedEx, they fly that flight plan every single time,” Ruffin said. “They even code it on the label and so it’s kind of locked in.”', 'Pandion’s technology, which is still being tested internally, will allow it to change the path of a package while it’s in flight, Ruffin said. For example, the software might flag a warehouse that’s shut down due to a Covid-19 outbreak or weather event. Pandion can then divert the packages to another site, increasing the likelihood that they’re delivered on time.', 'Ruffin said it’s like “the Waze of e-commerce shipping.”', '“We’re looking to see what’s happening to packages along a route and getting that signal in and making a real-time decision,” Ruffin said.', 'WATCH: Inside the rapid growth of Amazon Logistics and how it’s taking on third-party shipping']"

Renewable power and electric vehicles are getting cheaper, the grid is getting greener, and oil and gas companies are getting nervous.', 'That’s why the fossil fuel giants are looking towards petrochemicals, and plastics in particular, as their next major growth market.', '“Plastics is the Plan B for the fossil fuel industry,” said Judith Enck, Founder and President of the nonprofit advocacy group Beyond Plastics.', 'Plastics, which are made from fossil fuels, are set to drive nearly half of oil demand growth by midcentury, according to the International Energy Agency. That outpaces even hard-to-decarbonize sectors like aviation and shipping.', '“Every company who is currently engaged in producing plastic, if you look at their capital budgets for the next two to three years, they’re all talking about expansion plans,” said Ramesh Ramachandran, CEO of No Plastic Waste, an initiative from the Minderoo Foundation that’s working to create a market-based approach to a circular plastics economy.', 'Yet much of the developed world is already awash in plastics. So fossil fuel and petrochemical companies are relying on emerging economies in Asia and Africa to drive growth.', 'Alan Gelder of Wood Mackenzie forecasts that every year through 2050, there will be 10 million metric tons of growth in the market for petrochemicals, which are used to make plastics and other products. He says much of that will be shipped overseas.', '“We’re not expecting demand growth in the U.S., but it could be where the places where facilities get built to satisfy global demand growth.”', 'Alongside Middle Eastern oil giants like Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, the United States is a leading producer and exporter of plastic feedstocks and polymers. Asia in general, and China specifically, are the largest importers of these plastic building blocks.', 'But Enck doubts consumers actually want more plastic “So what is driving this, is just this glut of fracked gas and the fossil fuel industry teaming up with the chemical industry to just crank out more and more plastic.”', 'Indeed, an Ipsos survey of over 19,000 adults found that 71% of consumers worldwide want to ban single-use plastics.', 'As unpopular as they may be today, however, plastics became ubiquitous for a reason.', '“Petrochemicals are fantastically good at what they do in terms of lightweight flexibility, durability, versatility,” Gelder said. And thanks in part to fossil fuel subsidies, they’re also generally the cheapest option available.', 'The problem is that most plastic ends up languishing in landfills, or as litter on the land or sea. Only 9% of all plastic ever made has been recycled, because generally, making virgin plastic is the cheapest option.', 'China used to profitably recycle much of the world’s plastic, but stopped accepting plastic waste imports in 2018, since much of it was too contaminated to be repurposed. So now, that waste is being diverted to poorer nations that don’t have the infrastructure to process or recycle it. ', 'Africa saw a fourfold increase in plastic waste imports in 2019, the year after China closed its doors. Plastic also flooded into India, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam, which have since implemented their own import restrictions. But the U.S. is still sending its waste there anyway.', 'Meanwhile, the domestic petrochemical buildout often has harmful effects on the communities where these plants are located, as factory pollutants can effect the surrounding air, water and soil.', '“So this now makes plastics and plastic production a very serious environmental justice issue,” Enck said, “Because this petrochemical buildout is happening in low income communities and communities of color, mostly in Texas, Louisiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania.”', 'Sharon Lavigne understands these issues well. She lives in St. James Parish, Louisiana, which lies along a stretch of the Mississippi River often referred to as “Cancer Alley.” It’s home to over 150 petrochemical facilities and refineries, and the increased air pollution in the area has been linked to higher levels of cancer in poor communities.', '“I found out it was the plants that was poisoning us, making us sick and with cancer, mostly cancer,” Lavigne said. “And then I found out that when they come in here, they don’t hire anybody from Saint James.”', 'In 2018 she founded Rise St. James, with the goal of stopping the petrochemical expansion. The organization successfully halted construction of a $1.25 billion plastics plant by Wanhua Chemical, and is currently fighting to prevent Formosa Plastics from building a plant in the 5th district, where Lavigne lives. However, it looks like that project will proceed. ', 'The 5th district is 91% Black.', '“One time they wanted to build a plant in the white district and a parish council voted it down. They said no,” Lavigne said. But when similar plants were proposed in the 5th district, she said they were approved.', 'Overall, climate-focused think tank Carbon Tracker estimates that the externalities of plastics production are between $800 to $1,400 per metric ton of plastic produced, a cost that includes CO2 emissions, air pollution, waste management, and ocean cleanup efforts.', 'Yet even as producers prepare for growth, there are many signs that plastics alone cannot save the fossil fuel industry.', 'For one, the EU Directive on Single-Use Plastics recently took effect in Europe, and it intends to greatly reduce the amount of virgin plastic produced.', 'It mandates that, by 2025, all beverage bottles made of PET plastic must contain at least 25% recycled content, bans a wide variety of single-use products, and implements an extended producer responsibility scheme that makes plastics producers cover the cost of waste management and cleanup.', 'Ramachandran expects that this will lead to worldwide changes in the way plastic packaging is made.', '“I think within a year, maximum two, in Europe, you’re surely going to see mandatory recycled content in all packaging. And once that happens, it’s going to be like the California mileage standards. It’s very unlikely people are going to have one package for Europe and another package for other parts of the world. So I think it would surely accelerate and spread everywhere else.”', 'Maine and Oregon also recently introduced EPR laws that make plastics producers pay for recycling programs, and other states, including California and New York, want to follow suit.', 'Corporations too are showing signs of change. Ahead of the UN Environment Assembly conference, more than 70 companies called for a global pact to cut plastics production and decouple it from fossil fuels. Signatories included AMCOR, one of the world’s largest plastic packaging manufacturers, and major brands like Unilever, Walmart, Pepsi and Coke.', '“I don’t expect ExxonMobil or Dow DuPont to change. I do expect the big brands that are buying all of this plastic packaging to change fast,” Enck said.', 'Finally, plastics are simply a much smaller market segment than oil and gas. Petrochemicals comprised just 13% of ExxonMobil’s revenue in 2020, and 6.5% of Shell’s 2020 revenue.', '“So if you say, all of a sudden we stop driving gasoline-fueled passenger cars and we try and divert all of that material to petrochemicals, then you just arguably swamp the petrochemical market and reduce its attractiveness and profitability,” Gelder explained.', 'Basically, the plastics industry is too small to keeping oil and gas companies afloat, even if demand does continue to grow.', 'So while plastics benefit from the immense power of the fossil fuel lobby, the scale of the petrochemical industry, combined with legislative and corporate efforts to curb new plastic production, means that the oil and gas industry’s bet on plastics might not pan out they way they hope.', 'Watch the video to learn more.

Lazarus envisioned has been reduced to dusty floors and empty shelves.', 'Much has been said about the demise of the toy empire, which will shutter its U.S. stores for good on Friday. There have been fingers pointed at corporate raiders, Amazon and big-box stores. All contributed to its undoing.', 'Ultimately, though, Toys R Us’ collapse is a story of loyalty run dry. The store in its early days fostered devotion from customers and toymakers. In the end, it lost hold on both.', 'Toys R Us’ status as the most important toy store in town left it cavalier, if cocky at times, according to conversations with former employees, executives and industry insiders, who spoke to CNBC on the condition of anonymity. It didn’t invest in its stores, even as it was adding to the fleet, leaving it vulnerable when new competition moved in.', 'The story begins with Lazarus, the store’s visionary who wanted the “R” written backward — an ode to childlike scrawl. Lazarus, who has been described as one of the great merchants of his time, expanded a baby furniture store he owned into a toy store. By 1978, he had created a toy superstore large enough to become a public company.', 'In its heyday in the 1980s and 1990s, it was the most important toy store in the country, if not the world. Its strength grew as competitors Kiddie City and Child World went out of business.', 'Children across the world declared themselves a “Toys R Us kid.” Parents spent their weekend mornings walking their kids up and down its aisles. Planners visited to stock up, preparing for months of birthday parties.', '“I bought all their presents and bikes from there,” recalled Angela Corrigan, a New Jersey mom with two kids in college. “I remember the last time I walked in there ... I just walked in by myself and walked down the aisles feeling overwhelmed with emotions because my kids were too old for the store and our ritual was over.”', 'Eventually, in 1994, Lazarus passed the baton as CEO to Michael Goldstein, known for his adoration of toys that imbued his interaction with toymakers and store patrons.', '“Goldstein got to know nearly every start-up manufacturer and both he and Toys R Us wanted them to be successful,” said Bob Moog, co-founder of toy company University Games.', '“Most companies, more than 10 years old, wouldn’t be in business today it wasn’t for Toys R Us, the first national account to give them a chance.”', 'But Goldstein’s tenure was brief. He stepped down in 1998, leading the way to a revolving door of executives which included Robert Nakasone, who came from the grocery industry, and John Eyler, who came from FAO Schwarz.', 'All the while Toys R Us added stores, emboldened by its position as the most important toy store in town. It did not take care of that store base though, neither pruning stores that weren’t making money, nor putting resources toward those that were.', 'It also missed opportunities to make its stores nicer, cleaner and a destination for events. Toys R Us’ failure to translate the joy of toys into something more tangible in its stores was one of its biggest mistakes.', 'Another would be losing touch with the parents who shopped in its stores.', '“I remember when I first got there, walking into the first meeting with the executive committee thinking, ‘This is going to be interesting. Our target audience is moms with kids, and I just walked into a room of guys with ties,’” said Warren Kornblum, who worked as chief marketing officer in the late 1990s and mid-2000s.', 'Kornblum nonetheless recalled the thrill of being at the opening of Toys R Us’ giant Times Square flagship, adorned with a Ferris wheel, just months after 9/11.', '“We were getting ready to open the doors, and I saw what seemed like hundreds of kids. I saw the excitement in their eyes and I thought, ‘this is what Toys R Us is.’”', '“I think,” said Kornblum, “we just lost that.”', 'In its neglect, Toys R Us let the toys it sold become a commodity. That left it vulnerable when the most potent competitors it had to yet to face began to move in.', 'The dot-com bubble arrived and EToys, the internet toys start-up founded in 1997, went public two years later. It had a market capitalization that surpassed Toys R Us.', 'In need of a quick internet strategy, Toys R Us signed on to an expensive partnership with Amazon in 2000. The deal, one of the first of its kind, gave Amazon the exclusive rights to sell Toys R Us products on its website. Toys R Us paid it roughly $50 million a year, according to reports at the time.', 'Toys R Us had paid for exclusivity, but it didn’t get it. Amazon created a marketplace where it began selling others’ toy brands.', 'Toys R Us sued Amazon to get out of the contract. But the legal wrangling set it back financially, and left it even further behind in its e-commerce efforts. By the time the lawsuit was settled, Amazon paid $51 million to end the suit. However, the damage was done and the retailer was way behind in the e-commerce fight.', 'Then, came the discount chains. Walmart, Target and Kmart began going after the same moms who shopped in Toys R Us stores, slashing toy prices to bring them in. The core reason for Toys R Us existence — toys for kids — was being used by those bigger retailers as a way to get moms in the door, hoping they’d also spend on higher-margin products.', 'Under assault, Toys R Us stock tumbled.', 'All of this turned Toys R Us into perfect private equity bait. The mid-2000s were a boom for leveraged buyouts of retailers. The private equity funds were lured in by a combination of low interest rates, the recognizable names of the targets and the view that retailers’ steady cash flow would continue forever.', 'In 2006 alone, private equity firms spent $30 billion on leveraged buyouts of retailers — more than they had spent in total since 1998.', 'A hotly competitive sale of Toys R Us put the company into the hands of a trio of investors: KKR, Bain and Vornado. Together they paid $6.6 billion for the store in 2005, a deal they financed largely with debt. They saw value in its real estate and an opportunity to aggressively expand in Asia. The hope was to revive the company and take it public, using those proceeds to pay down the debt.', 'Though its owners took no dividends, that debt became an albatross for the toy retailer — sucking money out of it year after year. Toys R Us annually had to divert its cash flow to pay $400 million to service its more than $5 billion in debt, it later said in court filings. As the retail industry changed in ways no one expected, Toys R Us was crippled, unable to make the investments it needed.', '“These substantial debt service obligations impair the company’s ability to invest in its business and future. As a result, the company has fallen behind,” CEO Dave Brandon would tell the bankruptcy court.', 'Its historically strong baby business, Babies R Us, also came under attack. Parents soon discovered the luxury of buying their diapers online at Diapers.com. Then Bed Bath & Beyond acquired Buy Buy Baby, investing money Toys R Us didn’t have into more modern stores.', 'All the while, the toy industry was contracting. And, stunningly, children were getting older younger.', 'That meant Toys R Us’ target audience shifted to playing with computers, video games and tablets — no longer as interested in action figures or board games. From 2012 to 2017, the toy industry declined every year at a rate of 3.1 percent, according to data service IBIS World.', 'The Toys R Us owners filed for an IPO in 2010. It never happened as the businesses continued to deteriorate. All three eventually wrote down the value of their investment to zero. This on a company they collectively poured $3.5 billion into over the course of their ownership.', 'Amid industry strain and change, there continued to be one widely accepted tenet: toymakers will unconditionally support Toys R Us. The industry needed its beacon to protect prices, provide shelf space and act as a showman.', 'That tenet ultimately proved untrue.', 'In July 2017, Toys R Us hired restructuring advisors to help it address the $400 million in debt coming due in 2018. It became clear, though, that lenders were spooked by the increasing number of retail bankruptcies. Chances of refinancing were slim. The company and its advisors began to craft plans for a prepackaged bankruptcy to come after the holiday season.', 'In September, CNBC caught wind of the effort. It broke news to readers — and many toymakers — that Toys R Us was weighing bankruptcy. Bankruptcy risks rarely take industry insiders by surprise, but this one did. The retailer was on few, if any, immediate-term bankruptcy watch lists.', 'Stunned toymakers pulled back. Weakened brands could not risk giving Toys R Us products it might not pay for. Many complained that Toys R Us was uncommunicative about what was happening.', 'People close to Toys R Us agree it didn’t communicate well, in part because the situation was so fluid, it was difficult to give a cohesive message.', 'Within one week of the article’s publication, nearly 40 percent of its vendors refused to ship product without cash on delivery. Within three weeks, the run on the bank catapulted Toys R Us into bankruptcy, forcing it to file without a plan to emerge and before the crucial holiday season.', 'In bankruptcy court, Toys R Us played to its heritage, with its lawyers singing its famous jingle that they were “a Toys R Us kid.” It told vendors and shoppers that it would use its bankruptcy financing to finally make the changes it needed to compete. All it needed was a solid holiday season to make it through to the other side.', 'But loyalty to Toys R Us had frayed — for both consumers and the toymakers.', 'A number of brands limited their shipments to Toys R Us during the holiday season. Those that did ship are now on the hook for $450 million that might not get paid, according to The Wall Street Journal. The bankruptcy had left many manufacturers feeling battered. There were concerns Toys R Us’ challenges were too fundamental, and it would not be able to escape the same fate twice.', 'The big-box competitors, smelling blood in the water, slashed their prices, their final attack against the legendary retailer. In the 2017 Christmas season, shoppers chose discounts and convenience over Toys R Us. The retailer’s fate was all but sealed.', 'U.S. holiday sales produced earnings for Toys R Us that were $250 million below budget projections, court filings showed. It couldn’t in good faith ensure it would be able to satisfy the terms of its bankruptcy loan. The company estimated it would run out of cash in the U.S. by May 2018.', 'The weeks that followed the holidays included intense negotiations with its lenders but the conclusion soon became evident. Toys R Us would need to liquidate, a move expected to devastate the very toy industry it created, but which did not — or could not — come to its rescue.', '“I’m a believer there is no toys business without Toys R Us,” said Isaac Larian, CEO of MGA Entertainment, the maker of Bratz dolls and L.O.L. Surprise toys. “The toy business is going to be very small without them.”']"

65,Old Hummer plant now builds China-bound Mercedes SUVs,2015-08-11T17:07:21+0000,"['  Lamar Ashford has been waiting a long time to see  this.', '  Five years after General  Motors shut down production of the Hummer at the AM General  assembly plant in Mishawaka, Indiana, the assembly line that once  built the H2 is cranking out another SUV.', '  This time, it’s the Mercedes-Benz R Class.', '  “With this R series coming in, it is good for the community, good  for everyone’s family,” said Ashford, who has worked 14 years for  AM General.', '  Mercedes-Benz has contracted AM General to build the R Class  because the luxury automaker no longer has the space to build the  SUV at its plant in Vance, Alabama.  ', '  That plant, where Mercedes manufactures most of its SUVs, is  running at close to capacity. To keep up with demand, the German  automaker is cranking up production of popular models like the  GLK and M Class.  ', '  So it’s moved production of the R Class to northwest Indiana and  hired AM General to build models that will be shipped to China,  the only market where the SUV is sold.  ', '  Demand for SUVs in China has been strong, but the market overall  is pulling back.', '  On Tuesday, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers  said retail sales of passenger vehicles dropped 6.6 percent in  July. It was the third time in four months auto sales have  dropped in China, the world’s largest auto market. In addition,  China on Tuesday devalued its currency by nearly 2 percent, a move that  could cut Chinese luxury consumption.', '  But Mercedes-Benz is confident it can ride out any impact the  devaluation action in China may have on its business.', '  “Let’s wait and see what happens,” said Jason Hoff of Mercedes-Benz. “You know we do a lot of hedging too. We protect  ourselves obviously for different currency changes so we will  just have to wait and see. But so far it has been a good year for  us.”', '  AM General President Howard Glaser maintains his  enthusiasm.', '  After five long years, the R Class is helping Mishawaka heal from  losing the Hummer.', '  “We are not just focused on the past, the Hummer and the H2. We  are looking to the future, we are looking to the front windshield  not the rearview mirror and we think it is going to be a great  ride,” said Glaser.', '  Mercedes’ hiring AM General to build the R Class is the latest  sign automakers are close to running at peak capacity.', '  After cutting U.S. auto production to 5.6 million vehicles in  2009, the auto industry has staged a huge recovery.  ', '  According to the consulting firm LMC Automotive, which tracks  auto production around the world,  U.S. auto plants will  build more than 11.8 million vehicles this year.', '  “We are seeing some pretty serious capacity constraints,” said  Jeff Schuster, senior vice president for forecasting with LMC  Automotive. “There are a few places where automakers have some  room, but in many plants they are pushing capacity.”', '  Right now, U.S. auto plants are utilizing 93 percent of their  capacity, with some plants running over 100 percent, according to  LMC.', '  “We’re seeing some plants where they have added weekend shifts or  they’ve increased the line speed in order to squeeze out a few  more vehicles,” said Schuster.', '  At the AM General facility in Mishawaka, there’s plenty of  capacity, and a skilled workforce ready to build the R Class.', '  Eventually, several hundred more workers are expected to be hired  as R Class production ramps up.', '  For Ashford, it’s welcome news that eases the pain of losing the  Hummer during the recession. “We were just ready to get back into  the plant. We love to work here,” he said.', ' Questions? Comments? BehindTheWheel@cnbc.com.']"
