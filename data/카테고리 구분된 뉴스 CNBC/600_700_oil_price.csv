Beijing will allow private and state-controlled companies to import U.S. LNG and encourage them to invest in import infrastructure, a person familiar with negotiations told The Wall Street Journal.', 'Shares of Cheniere Energy popped 4 percent on Friday after the company told Reuters it has held “extensive negotiations” over the past month with Chinese state-owned companies about increasing LNG shipments to China.', 'Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Friday the deal would help to “liberate American energy.”', '“China is the world’s largest buyer of LNG. Now that market really is going to be open to the American producers,” Ross told CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”', 'In fact, Japan is the largest market for LNG, followed by South Korea and then China, according to the International Gas Union. But China is the world’s fastest-growing market for LNG, according to energy research firm Wood Mackenzie.', 'The deal positions the United States to capture part of that growth, which would represent $26 billion a year in purchases by 2030 at today’s prices, according Massimo Di-Odoardo, head of global gas and LNG research at Wood Mackenzie.', 'However, he cautioned that U.S. LNG’s fortunes in China “will depend on its competitiveness versus other global alternatives and Chinese buyer appetite for exposure to U.S. gas prices.”', 'Alan Bannister, regional director for energy pricing at S&P Global Platts, noted on Friday that shipping LNG to China from the U.S. Gulf Coast — where much of the export capacity is planned or being built — would be inefficient and unlikely.', '', '“China is much nearer and much cheaper to ship from Australia, for example, or Qatar,” he said. “What I think we’re more likely to see in the real world is that U.S. Gulf Coast LNG will primarily go to Europe.”', 'China imported 26.1 million tons of LNG in 2016, up 32.6 percent on year, IHS Fairplay reported. The shipping news outlet noted that Australia accounted for 46 percent of China’s LNG imports in 2016, or 12 million tons. Qatar supplied 19 percent, while just around 200,000 tons came from the United States in 2016.', 'Any uptick in exports to China would have to wait until the United States builds more of the expensive facilities where natural gas is cooled into liquid and loaded onto specialized tankers.', 'Only one LNG export terminal is operating in the Lower 48 states: Cheniere Energy’s Sabine Pass facility in Louisiana. Alaska has also exported LNG, primarily to Japan, for decades.', 'Four other facilities under construction in Texas, Louisiana and Maryland are slated to come online by 2021, pushing U.S. export capacity to 9.2 billion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.', 'On Friday, Ross blamed the Obama administration for holding up approvals for more than a dozen LNG export facilities. “Presumably that will be cleared out now and we will get that going,” he told CNBC.', 'As of January, 13 LNG export terminals were proposed to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the body that approves them.', ' Proposed North American LNG export terminals, source: FERC', '', 'This week, the Trump administration moved toward getting those terminals approved by nominating two commissioners to FERC.

1,Why fans keep watching ‘The Walking Dead’ even though they don’t like it anymore,2019-08-04T13:45:30+0000,"['In July at San Diego Comic-Con, the trailer for the 10th season of AMC’s “The Walking Dead” premiered. The new season of the zombie apocalypse show will begin October 6, but judging from some of the negative fan reactions in recent years, one might wonder if the show can still attract enough viewers to justify renewing it.“There wasn’t one single episode or event or death that made me walk away, but rather a culmination of bad episodes, poor storytelling, repetitive narratives and an undertow that pulled us further and further away from what first brought us together,” said writer Patrick Schmidt in a Fansided article titled, “Why I’m Breaking Up with ’The Walking Dead.” ', 'It wasn’t always like this. The show premiered in 2010 and by season five, it was a ratings sensation, pulling in 17.3 million viewers, which made it the most-watched show in cable television history. It became a pop-culture touchstone and inspired a spin-off show, “Fear of the Walking Dead,” as well as a themed cruise ship getaway called the “Walker-Stalker Cruise,” with zombie-themed activities and meet-and-greets with the show’s cast.', 'Sadly, dissatisfaction with the show began to build within the fan community and intensified during season eight, when large numbers of fans gave up on the show. In a piece called “Why People Stopped Watching ‘The Walking Dead,’” Looper’s A.J. Caulfield wrote what could have been the zombie saga’s post mortem.', '“Over halfway into its eighth season, ‘The Walking Dead’ has dipped to its lowest ratings since its freshman season — pulling in just 6.8 million viewers (down from the 11.44 million who tuned in to the season eight premiere) for episode 10,” he wrote.', 'Season nine received better reviews than its predecessors, but it may have been too little, too late. According to Variety, the last episode of season nine, which aired on March 31, was the lowest-rated finale in the show’s history.“In the Nielsen Live+Same Day ratings, Sunday’s finale averaged a 1.9 rating in adults 18-49 and 5 million viewers,” Variety said. ”[I]t is down approximately 44% in the key demo and 37% in total viewers compared to the Season 8 finale (3.4 rating, 7.9 million viewers).”', 'While all of this news would seem to indicate that “The Walking Dead” is now roundly unpopular, the eulogies have all been premature. Representatives for AMC would not comment for this article, but the 10th season is indeed on its way, which would seem to imply that the network believes the show still has an audience.Beyond that, production began in July on a second, as-yet-untitled spin-off of the show  and a standalone movie is also in the works. In other words, despite many fans’ grousing, the franchise is doing just fine. So why do viewers keep watching a show that they say they don’t like anymore?According to Vassilis Dalakas, professor of marketing and chair of the Department of Marketing at California State University San Marcos, it’s because of the “sunk cost” fallacy. Viewers feel they’ve made an investment in the show and they don’t want to waste it, even if it means losing an hour of their lives each week to something that feels like a chore.', '“It is hard to give up on it on season 10,” he said. “Essentially, this would be like admitting they wasted the past nine years they had been watching this show.', 'Writer Erika Holmes, herself a fan of “The Walking Dead,” attributed the show’s ability to retain viewers to what she called “the science of storytelling.', '“When we start a story, no matter how long or short it is, it creates an ‘open loop’ in our minds,” she said. “That means our brains naturally want a conclusion. We crave closure. The only way to close the loop is to watch until the end, even if it means venting our frustrations on social media or at the water cooler the next day.”', 'Andrew Selepak, media professor in the Department of Telecommunication at the University of Florida, agreed. He said that “The Walking Dead” is retaining enough viewers to remain viable because fans want to see which characters will make it to the final episode, even if that means watching a show that they say is offering diminishing returns.', '“Rick Grimes is gone, Carl is dead, Glenn is dead,” he said. “The only reason to keep watching is to see how our favorite character’s storyline ends.“For now, that may be enough to keep viewers tuned in. It may even be enough to justify the expansion of the franchise. But Selepak said that if the overall quality of the program doesn’t improve, viewers will want nothing more from the show than its ending. “We can only watch our favorite characters wander around doing the same thing over and over before we even stop caring about that,” he said. “At some point, we just want our favorite characters to ride off into the sunset and recreate the world.”']"
2,Why disruption in the South China Sea could have ‘gigantic’ consequences for global trade,2016-07-18T14:01:55+0000,"['  With tension rising in recent years over territory in the South  China Sea, analysts have explained to CNBC what conflict in the  region could mean for global trade.', '  “Should conflict arise … the consequences for global trade  would be gigantic,” Francois Godement, director of the Asia and  China program at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told  CNBC via telephone.', '  Ratings agency Fitch supported the claim by warning in a report  Wednesday that, “The potential economic implications (of  geopolitical risks in Asia) could be severe in the event of a  sudden escalation.”', '  The report came after a ruling by the Hague on Tuesday which  rejected China’s claims to almost all of the South China Sea, in  a case raised by the Philippines. The present situation in the  area is being watched closely by stakeholders in the region’s  annual $5 trillion shipping industry.', 'The South China Sea is a vital trading passage for China, Japan  and Korea, as well as other nations on the western rim of the  Pacific, serving as their only bulk trading route with key  markets in the Americas and Europe, amongst others. Over $5  trillion of annual shipping trade passes through the region, and,  according to the Wall Street Journal, U.S.-only imports and  exports make up $1.2 trillion of this. The waters allow domestic  goods, oil and raw materials to transit to destinations around  the world.', '  Circumnavigating the South China Sea to avoid conflict would be  more expensive for shipping firms as the waters serve as part of  the most direct sea route between the Asian and European  continents. The extra distance would involve massive extra fuel  costs.', '  Simon Lockwood, deputy managing director, marine at Willis Towers  Watson believes that a shift in the balance of power in a region  like this is unlikely to have an adverse effect on trading  vessels, but added this was providing the power shift “does not  coincide with open hostilities.”', '  According to the Financial Times Monday, China’s Maritime Safety  Agency has announced that it will carry out military exercises in  the South China Sea this week, though these are expected to be  within its internationally recognized waters. The drills are  third event of this kind announced by the Hainan MSA this year.', '  Industry voices say that shipping remains currently unaffected by  the build-up of military equipment in the region. Andrew Brooker,  a founding partner at shipping insurance firm Latitude Brokers  explained that “trade routes are not affected, therefore costs  are not increased and there is very little discussion amongst  operators in the region (of disruption).”', '  Commodity markets responded apprehensively to Tuesday’s ruling  last week, with Brent crude futures rising $1 per barrel on the  news according to Reuters. But, Maersk Line, the largest  container shipping company in the world, told CNBC that their  current operations in the area are normal with no change to  existing procedures.', 'Despite inflamed rhetoric directed at the U.S. and its allies  concerning the Hague’s ruling, China said in a government  statement on July 12 that it is, “ready to work with other  coastal states and the international community to ensure the  safety of and the unimpeded access to the international shipping  lanes in the South China Sea.”', '  Though some suspect that Tuesday’s decision in favor of the  Philippines could encourage other small countries in the region  to reassert their claim to areas of the South China Sea, Godement  believes that it is China who decides the direction in which the  situation will progress.', 'Follow CNBC International  on Twitter and Facebook.']"

6,JPMorgan has Wall Street’s biggest spending problem,2022-04-12T14:33:58+0000,"['Jamie Dimon has earned his credibility from investors, running one of the tightest ships in the banking sector and delivering on targets repeatedly over the years. But as JPMorgan Chase gets set to release one of the bellwether earnings reports of the season this week, the long-time Wall Street CEO is busy trying to win a messaging war that the bank has struggled with in recent months. After its last earnings, when JPMorgan revealed it was spending billions of dollars more than it had previously forecast, up to $3.5 billion more, analysts and shareholders were unsettled.', 'In his closely read annual letter to shareholders released last week, Dimon provided his latest defense of bank spending, and in particular, technology spending, writing of the existential threat to the traditional banks from fintech rivals and market giants like Walmart and Apple encroaching on its turf.', 'The threat is an issue Dimon has opined on at length in recent years — he called one section of the letter “Competitive Threat Redux” — and the spending issue related to it isn’t likely to go away. Dimon wrote in the letter the spending will continue, and the Wall Street pushback which began last quarter is likely to continue as well.', 'The gap between investors and JPMorgan may not be possible to resolve in any CEO letter or quarterly report. Technology investments need to be made, but tech is an area of spending in which it is difficult to determine return on investment in the short term. And last quarter, the $3.5 billion on top of an already increasing investment profile was a lot to take, even from a management team that has proven its ability to generate returns on investment.', '“None of these things happen in a vacuum and the management team has a history of execution,” said Jim Mitchell, Seaport Global financial services sector analyst in an interview after the last earnings. “The management team does matter ... so there should be willingness to give them some credibility for spending all that money, but from the investor standpoint, it is a big step up in spend,” Mitchell said.', 'And it came on top of multiple times the bank raised expense guidance last year. “The magnitude was more than people expected,” he said.', 'The banking sector has been in the red this year, and JPMorgan’s roughly 17% year-to-date decline is among the larger losses in the big bank group.', 'There is a “little bit of near-term purgatory,” Mitchell said. “It was all just up. I was a little surprised they didn’t have a better answer other than ‘we need to do it.’”', 'Dimon’s letter to shareholders did attempt to expand on that answer, by first repeating his warning from recent years that the technology threats are everywhere.', '“Last year alone, $130 billion was invested in fintech, allowing them to speed things up — and at scale,” Dimon noted. “The pace of change and the size of the competition are extraordinary, and activity is accelerating.”', 'He called out Walmart, which has over 200 million customers visit their stores each week and can use new digital technologies to bring banking-type services to their customers. And Apple, which already has Apple Pay and the Apple Card, and is moving into payment processing, credit risk assessment, person-to-person payment systems, merchant acquiring and buy-now-pay-later offers.', 'All of this is occurring alongside a diminished role for banks, which Dimon laid out by the numbers. ', '“I can go on and on, but suffice it to say, we must be prepared for this trend to continue. … sometimes it truly is change or die,” Dimon wrote.', 'All the big banks are spending on tech, and spending similar amounts relative to their assets in recent years, according to Gerard Cassidy, large cap bank analyst and head of U.S. bank equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets.', '“Half tech spend is to run the bank and half is to change the bank,” Cassidy said in an interview after the last earnings.', 'But JPMorgan’s spending continues to trend higher while Bank of America’s is flat.', 'One of the big items that stands out from the JPMorgan spending relates to overseas expansion. Investors are finally coming to realize how much the company’s overseas expansion strategy that relies on digital will cost. “All of us maybe didn’t appreciate the cost of the expansion into England and completely digital expansion,” Cassidy said.', 'Dimon responded to this issue in the annual letter, saying starting from scratch in creating a virtual version of what already exists physically in the U.S. with is branch networks is the right way to go overseas, but he didn’t provide much clarity. ', '“We believe the digital world gives us an opportunity to build a consumer bank outside the United States that, over time, can become very competitive — an option that does not exist in the physical world,” Dimon wrote. “We can apply what we have learned in our leading U.S. franchise and vice versa. We may be wrong on this one, but I like our hand,” he wrote.', 'Investors, though, will be looking for more hard numbers, and some banks have begun to increase disclosure on digital.', 'Bank of America is disclosing more digital metrics and has shown its ability to grow the consumer business digitally, with almost half of all consumer bank product sales now conducted through digital channels and deposit transactions done digitally and at ATMs now nearing 90%.', 'For all the banks, there will be more need for more data on how the investments in technology being made to “change” the industry are working.', '“These are the metrics we want to see for all banks to see if digital adoption is strong,” Cassidy said.', 'Analysts concede metrics on tech payoff are hard to produce in the short term. But on the other side, “To just give them carte blanche to spend X billions to do it ... now people are saying you’ve got to start showing us some metrics on level of returns we find acceptable,” Cassidy said. “We want to see the metrics supporting success, and the more reluctant a bank is to disclose, the more people start to scratch their heads.”', 'In all, investments in technology and operations, at a little under $2 billion, “are the most complicated category,” Dimon wrote. And in the letter he prepared shareholders for the investments to continue.', '“Sometimes people refer to some of these expenses as modernizing or adopting new technologies. … the term implies that once you get to a modern platform, these expenses should dramatically decrease — which is rarely the case. … Technology always drives change, but now the waves of technological innovation come in faster and faster,” he wrote.', '“Every year we are seeing increases, so at what point does it level off? Can you spend $20 billion a year methodically, or is it reckless at some point?” Mitchell asked. ', 'Proof over time, measured in above average growth across platforms and market share gains should result in greater operating leverage and incremental margins. And analysts says the track record of JPMorgan’s management team should breed some confidence, as well as the fact that it has been one of the more aggressive banks in trying to get on top of all the changes going on around tech, and fintech and the marketplace.', '“At some point there should be a crossover to efficiencies and improving margins,” Mitchell said. “Right now, Dimon is just saying ’trust me. ... I think long-term they will be a winner. It’s just always hard to know when the market will be convinced of that and not worry so much about expenses. We will be looking every quarter and checking,” Mitchell said.', 'Cassidy is willing to give JPMorgan the benefit of the doubt. “Three or four years from now the numbers should play out to prove a successful strategy, but you can’t measure it in less than 6 months.”']"
7,Cramer calls L3Harris the best defense play to own. Here’s when to pull the trigger,2019-07-24T22:45:00+0000,"['CNBC’s Jim Cramer on Wednesday recommended that investors be ready to buy shares of the newly formed L3Harris Technologies on any pull back when it reports next week.', 'The “Mad Money” host is unsure what to expect when the defense contractor hosts its conference call Wednesday morning, but he is sure of its viability. L3Harris, the result of a merger of Harris Corp. and L3 Technologies, ranks among the top six defense companies in the United States.', '“This was a brilliant combination that’s created the most high-tech operator in the industry,” he said.', 'L3Harris builds military products through four segments: Integrated Mission Systems, Space and Airborne Systems, Communication Systems and Aviation Systems. The merger allows the company to invest efficiently in innovation, which mirrors the merger of United Technologies and Raytheon, Cramer said. Some of the products it makes includes radios, air traffic control systems and space hardware, and the company plans to put 4% of its revenue into research and development in actionable intelligence, war-fighter effectiveness and spectrum superiority, CNBC reported.', 'Out of the major U.S. defense contractors, Cramer thinks L3Harris supports some of the most valuable projects with its technical expertise building equipment that affixes to ships and planes. Goldman Sachs earlier this month began covering the stock, issuing a “Buy” rating with a $240 price target.', '“They think the company can beat Wall Street’s consensus earnings estimates in short order, and they believe L3Harris is poised to take market share in the Pentagon budget thanks to their technology-rich product offerings,” Cramer said. “They’re in some of the strongest parts of the defense sector, both companies had strong numbers the last time they reported, and management has a tremendous track record.”', 'Buying the stock here at about $180 is a bet on management’s ability to mitigate costs, Cramer said. CEO Bill Brown, who led Harris Corp., says the combined company is “an efficient solutions provider, and 40% of our total savings are going back to the customer in the form of cost-plus contracts that drive more affordability.” In two years, he will retire and be succeeded by COO Chris Kubasik, who was chief of L3 Technologies.', 'L3Harris is laboring to integrate the companies by optimizing the supply chains and reducing overhead expenses, Cramer said. The company is also offering shareholders a 10% dividend boost and initiating a $4 billion stock buyback.', '“Man, $4 billion — that is substantial. This is only a $44 billion company ... that means they’re planning to retire roughly 9% of the share count, including more than 5% over the next year,” he said.', 'L3Harris’ stock has rose nearly $20 since it closed in early July and trades at 18-times next year’s earnings estimates. That’s more expensive than its peers like Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics that sell for 15-times and 14-times earnings, respectively, Cramer noted.', '“However, I think L3Harris deserves the premium because it’s the most technologically oriented, difficult proprietary defense contractor there is. It’s probably the least levered to any individual project that might potentially be cut” in case the defense budget gets reduced in the future.', 'L3Harris will present second quarter earnings in a week.', '“I like L3Harris so much that I think you should be prepared to buy it if the quarter’s confusing ... and the stock pulls back,” Cramer said. “Although, get this: I would not be averse to you buying stock” ahead of time.']"

This year it’s a different story, due to Beijing’s 25 percent retaliatory tariffs on American soybeans that went into effect July 6.', '“Now that China isn’t buying any U.S. beans or very little of it, it’s all backing up — especially in the Dakotas, where they’ve really expanded soybean acres over the years,” said Terry Reilly, a senior commodity analyst at Futures International in Chicago.', 'North Dakota soybean farmers are especially exposed in the U.S.-China trade dispute because of their dependence on China. The state’s production of soybeans has soared more than 70 percent in the past five years, fed by China’s demand and rail infrastructure that allows the commodity to travel to ports in the Pacific Northwest.', '“There have been no signs of demand coming back,” said Nancy Johnson, executive director of the North Dakota Soybean Growers Association. “We still have seen no bids at the Pacific Northwest, which is where most of our soybeans are exported out of.”', 'Then again, some reports suggest China might be buying U.S. beans but through backdoor channels such as Argentina, which has been a large buyer of American soy this year. Argentina had a poor crop of its own this year due to unfavorable weather, so it’s been gobbling up U.S. supplies.', '“Seventy percent of the soybeans leave our state for the [Pacific Northwest], and virtually 100 percent of that goes to China,” said soybean grower Joe Morken, chairman of the North Dakota Soybean Council.', 'With the lack of soybean demand at Pacific Northwest ports, that has meant local grain elevators in the Dakotas have been lowering cash prices for beans. The price partly reflects higher transportation costs getting the product to processors and export markets.', '“You’ve got these [grain] elevators in North Dakota, where all of a sudden their market they basically established themselves based upon China is now closed,” said Mike Steenhoek, executive director of the Soy Transportation Coalition, a trade group. “They call them ‘refugee’ soybeans because they don’t really have a home anymore.”', 'The price paid to soybean farmers is calculated on what’s known as basis, which is the difference between the futures market price on the Chicago Board of Trade and what the local grain elevator is willing to pay. The basis has widened dramatically in the past year for North Dakota soy farmers, going from about 70 cents to $1 per bushel to closer to $1.55 to $2 per bushel.', '“We always have a bad basis up here because of our location,” Morken said Friday. “But we’re probably 60 cents worse than a normal year plus what the market has gone down at the Chicago Board of Trade since the trade war has gone on.”', 'Morken, who farms in Casselton, North Dakota, has harvested about a third of his soybeans and plans to store the vast majority of it to wait out the trade war. There’s always a risk the trade war could last well into 2019 and leave farmers like Morken with full bins during the next harvest.', '“If this is still going a year from now, I don’t know what happens, because I’m not going to have room for them, my elevator is not going to have room for them, and nobody is buying them,” he said.', 'Michael Langemeier, agricultural economist at Purdue University’s Center for Commercial Agriculture, said the net benefits of storing soybeans this winter are attractive right now. “There’s a strong price signal to store now, and part of that is the high yields expected from the current harvest,” he said.', 'Soy farmers in other areas, including Iowa, Illinois and Indiana, also have been adversely affected by the trade fight with China, given that the commodity has fallen about 17 percent in price on the decline in the soybean futures market since China announced the tariff. But because Midwest states are more diversified in terms of customers, the basis widening tends to be less pronounced than in the Dakotas.', 'On Monday, Arthur Cos in the Arthur, North Dakota, area had a cash bid for soybeans of $7.03 per bushel, according to data on AgWeb.com. That was 89 cents per bushel below, or about 11 percent less than, what Ramsey Grain in Rochester, Illinois, was paying for the commodity.', 'Last year, the U.S. exported about $20 billion of agricultural products to China, and soybeans accounted for more than $12.2 billion of that amount, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.', 'China buys about two-thirds of the world’s soybean exports, using most of it for soy protein to feed roughly 700 million pigs in the country or to make cooking oil. The soy also is used for feeding poultry and to support the country’s fish farming sector.', 'With the lack of Chinese demand, there’s been an effort to redirect more beans south to river terminals where the commodity can eventually be shipped out of Gulf of Mexico ports. There are reports that port terminals and elevators in Louisiana are starting to experience congestion as more farm goods move down the Mississippi River.', '“They didn’t create this superhighway to connect production in North Dakota to the Mississippi River or to the Mexican market or to the Atlantic Coast,” said Steenhoek. “Yes, there’s still a way to get there, but it wasn’t built with that in mind to handle this huge surge of production.”', 'More than two-thirds of South Dakota’s annual soybean crop gets shipped to Asia, with most of it destined for China. Soybeans are the biggest crop grown in the state, rivaling corn and wheat.', '“We were possibly too reliant on China as far as a customer,” said Todd Hanten, who grows soybeans and corn near Goodwin, South Dakota. “We’re going to have to find new customers and new uses for our products, or we’ll have to change what we grow.”', 'Hanten said about 10 to 15 percent of his soybeans are harvested but weather has led to delays. He plans to market about one third of his crop this season and expects to get extra bushels from a strong crop to help cushion the blow of lower prices.', '“Things were really good for a while, and they may be very good again,” said Daniel Kowalski, an economist and vice president of CoBank’s Knowledge Exchange division. “But for the time being, where we are with trade talks, it’s just tough.”', 'Kowalski said China may pull back in the near term but he doesn’t think they can pull back in the long term. “They still need to produce or import pork, and they need to import soybeans, because they don’t have enough land. So this is a little bit of a game of chicken now with China to see who can outlast who.”']"

China already has a 25 percent tax on all globally imported cars and is now threatening an additional 25 percent hike for U.S.-built vehicles.', 'Analysts at investment firm Evercore ISI said Wednesday that a “blunt conclusion” was that a 25 percent additional auto tariff would generate a $1.73 billion impact this year on German auto firms BMW and Mercedes owner, Daimler. Thus, the current trade spat looks to be drawing in the top three of the world’s largest economies: the U.S., China and now the European Union.', 'The note added that Ford, Fiat Chrysler, and GM would be broadly unaffected as they largely build their Chinese products in China.', 'In terms of a negative impact, Evercore claimed that BMW would account for the lion’s share, accruing a $965 million hit in 2018. To get to that figure the analysts calculated that BMW will generate almost $4 billion worth of 2018 sales from cars built in the U.S. and then shipped to China. The analysis assumed a transaction price of $60,000 per car.', 'BMW Group, who sold almost 2.5 million cars globally in 2017, was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.', 'In the case of Daimler, the 2018 cost was put at $765 million, based on 51,000 vehicles being exported to China. The analysts again assumed an average transaction price of $60,000 and an annual revenue of just over $3 billion. Daimler told CNBC it would not comment on market speculation or ongoing negotiations between China and the U.S. The firm did add that it was “monitoring the situation closely.”', 'The U.S. firm Tesla doesn’t provide numbers of deliveries to China but does offer revenue data, suggesting sales worth around $2 billion in 2017. According to Evercore, Tesla could, therefore, be a big loser with tariff impacts potentially reaching $507 million in 2018.', 'Tesla has reportedly agreed with Chinese officials to build a plant in Shanghai but nothing concrete has yet been announced, with some suggesting that Beijing wants to impose a joint venture arrangement.', 'The U.S.-based firms Fiat Chrysler and Ford already have Chinese manufacturing plants in place and because of this they are seen as relatively immune to the latest salvo of trade threats. Evercore estimates that Ford would import just under 19,000 cars to China this year at an average transaction price of $32,000. The dollar impact from any fresh tariff would, therefore, total just $151 million.', 'For Fiat Chrysler Autos, the situation is even less dramatic. Evercore suggested that in 2018 the negative dollar impact would be around $80 million. According to Evercore, GM will export no cars to China from the United States in 2018.']"

27,Energy companies choose storing oil over selling it cheap,2015-12-04T16:57:47+0000,"['  Just a few miles from Houston’s Astrodome, a cluster of  subterranean salt caverns will soon be able to store enough oil  to fill the famed stadium.', '  By the end of 2016, phase I of Fairway Energy Partners’ Pierce  Junction crude oil storage facility will come online, touting  three caverns capable of socking away a combined 10 million barrels of  black gold. That will represent 25 percent of the Houston market’s  total crude storage capacity, and the privately held company has  plans to expand to 20 million barrels.', '  “We are actively leasing to capacity right now and the marketplace is being received very favorably,” said Chris Hilgert,  chief executive of Fairway. “We have a  competitive cost advantage that we are trying to exploit as much  as we can, and offer a much-needed service to a market that we  feel needs more liquidity, which storage offers.”', '  Salt caverns are typically a less costly means of storage than renting a tanker ship as “floating  storage” or the using above-ground tanks. Salt caverns are also a less common  option for commercial crude storage, making Pierce Junction a  notable midstream newcomer to the Texas oil market. ', '  “We have seen a big renaissance of production here in the U.S., and lots of new pipeline infrastructure has been built into the  Houston market, and the market has responded the best it can to  build surface tankage,” says Hilgert. But “more storage is needed  in order for the [area] to be able to handle all of this inbound  crude from those pipelines.”', '  Fairway is betting on that need, but it certainly isn’t alone. A  number of high-profile infrastructure projects are in the works  along the Gulf Coast, even as depressed crude prices have  resulted in hundreds of billions of dollars in spending cuts  throughout the overall energy sector.', '  Energy data firm Genscape estimates that 19 million barrels’ worth of  above-ground storage is currently under development in Texas  alone, in addition to Fairway’s caverns. ', '  “Some of those [investments] are actually entire new terminals  that are going in on the water. They provide access for both  intra-North American movements and the possible export of crude  or condensate, and then of course there’s the possible swap of  crude oil with Mexico,” said Brian Busch, director of oil markets  and business development at energy research firm Genscape. “So we see new terminals in  Corpus Christi being built along the river, and we see the  expansion of many of the terminals along the Houston ship  channel, Pasadena, and over all the way into Beaumont.”', '  While a four-decades-old U.S. crude export ban persists, energy  companies are allowed to export condensate, a super-light oil  that undergoes minimal processing to qualify as a refined  product. In August. the United States approved crude export swaps with  Mexico as well, marking the latest loosening of export policy.    ', '  As opportunities to move more oil and petroleum products in and  out of the Gulf Coast present themselves, refineries and infrastructure  companies are getting ready. ', '  Enbridge announced a $5 billion, multiyear plan to create three  oil terminals between Houston and St. James Parish in Louisiana that will likely include crude storage, pipelines and ship docks. ', 'In Beaumont, Texas, at the terminal it purchased from Chevron  last year, independent refiner Phillips 66 is doubling crude  storage capacity to 16 million barrels. In St. Landry Parish,  Louisiana, Hazelwood Energy Hub is planning a $400 million crude  storage and blending complex.  ', '  Even the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP), which stores and distributes foreign crude it offloads from tankers, said it’s doubling an expansion plan to add 2.2 million barrels of above-ground crude storage capacity at  its Clovelly Hub.', '  All of those projects are still months, and in many cases  years, away from completion, but they help illustrate how storage has been filling up fast at a time when the world is awash in oil. ', '  According to the Energy Information Administration, for the week  ending Nov. 27, U.S. commercial crude inventories (excluding  the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) climbed to 489.4 million  barrels — the highest level for this time of year in at least  eight decades — and 1.5 million barrels shy of the modern record of 490.9 million, hit in April.', '  Eric Lee, vice president of commodities at Citi Research, points  out that, based on above-ground and underground commercial  storage, plus oil in transit (in pipelines, for instance), total U.S.  tank capacity is 63 percent utilized, meaning nearly two-thirds  of the nation’s available storage is full. Refineries, which  account for an additional 152 million barrels of crude capacity,  are operating at a 68 percent utilization rate. ', '  “We have never been that close [to filling up] anywhere except  Cushing [Oklahoma] in past few years, and we are much higher now than we  have ever been,” Lee said. ', '  He noted that while utilization rates are high  historically in the United States, it’s arguably the only major energy-producing country in the world that isn’t on  the cusp of running completely out of space or is out of it  already. ', '  Stateside, the two regions seeing the biggest inventory builds  have been the Midwest (PADD 2) and the Gulf Coast (PADD 3). The  Midwestern Petroleum Administration for Defense District includes Cushing, one of the largest collections of tank farms in  the world, while PADD 3 is home to an extensive network of  refineries that process both domestic and imported crude. ', '  More than half of U.S. stockpiles — 250 million barrels — currently sit in the Gulf Coast. The region hit a record  high a few weeks ago, ticking down only slightly in recent weeks  as refineries have come out of maintenance season and local, year-end  taxes stimulate a draw-down in inventories.', '  “Basically, you’re still at year-over-year, all-time highs in  inventory — and at all-time highs pretty significantly,”  says Genscape’s Busch. “Not just along the Gulf Coast, but also  throughout North America.”']"

But books -- even the physical kind -- remain a popular category, and Amazon is a big platform for large and independent booksellers to distribute their titles.', 'Starting Aug. 31, those third-party merchants have to adapt to a significant and costly change. According to an email that Amazon sent to sellers of books, CDs and DVDs, distributors to the lower 48 states will have to deliver items within a window of four to eight days, down from four to 14 days. ', '“We are launching new capabilities to help you set faster delivery times for your Seller fulfilled products. Customers are more likely to purchase products that have a faster estimated delivery time at checkout,” the company said in an email to sellers that was obtained by CNBC.', 'For Amazon customers, particularly Prime members, this type of change may seem antiquated. Amazon has trained us to expect everything to arrive in two days, and in some cases faster. The company is putting in place a number of policies that force sellers to provide the same speed and quality of service that customers have come to expect from Amazon. Last week, CNBC reported on a new measure that makes it easier for buyers to get refunds at the seller’s expense.', 'But marketplace merchants, who sell out of their garage or warehouse rather than using Amazon’s fulfillment centers, have to build shipping costs into their business model, and they typically operate on very thin margins.', 'An East Coast seller, who asked that we not use his name for fear of retribution from Amazon, said he’s been selling books on the site for 13 years, generating over $1 million in gross revenue, and this is the first time he’s been forced to alter his delivery time. He expects his shipping costs to increase by 25 percent to 50 percent because he will no longer be able to rely on the U.S. Postal Service for cross-country deliveries and will instead have to use a more expensive express option.', 'The USPS has a special rate for media items and says on its website that delivery times range from two to eight days. But sellers told CNBC that coast-to-coast shipments often take a few days longer than that. The risk to missing Amazon’s guaranteed delivery window is that a seller gets bad reviews, which means losing visibility on listings and can eventually lead to suspension.', 'Amazon said in an e-mailed statement that small businesses on the site are already delivering packages more quickly than expected. With the latest change, “we are bringing our promise in line with actual delivery times and helping small businesses increase sales without changing their current shipping methods,” the company said.', 'It’s been a rough year for media sellers on Amazon.', 'In March the company increased fees that those merchants pay for each item to $1.80 from $1.35. Then, as part of its crackdown on counterfeits, Amazon forced sellers of certain textbooks to show invoices before listing their items. Merchants buying used items from places like garage sales were suddenly stuck with unsellable inventory. ', '“Over the last six to eight months, there’s been a string of things coming out and it seems to be getting harder and harder in media,” said Tedric Paulk, co-founder of Oaxray, which helps sellers find inventory for their Amazon business. “They’re just trying to increase customer experience, and if it gets rid of some media sellers, I don’t think they’re worried about that.”', 'Books and music are already a tough market for Amazon merchants. Media has long been going digital, and Amazon is encouraging the move through Kindle and devices like the Fire TV Stick and Echo. Additionally, Amazon is opening its own physical book stores.

That comes after the arrest of its CFO on allegations the tech giant committed fraud linked to the skirting of U.S. sanctions, a report that American authorities are probing whether the firm stole trade secrets, and moves from multiple countries to block Huawei’s equipment from sensitive infrastructure projects.', 'In what appeared to be part of a significant public-relations push, the company offered international media a tour last week of its smartphone production factory in Dongguan, an area just north of its headquarters in Shenzhen. And then it took a group of reporters, including from CNBC, to a new campus being built to look like various cities in Europe.', 'The biggest sign of Huawei’s new public positioning came later that day, when the company hosted a round table with Ren Zhengfei, the telecommunication equipment maker’s reclusive founder. Ren very rarely speaks to the media, let alone international publications, and is not often seen in public. He spent more than two hours taking questions from outlets including CNBC, addressing some of the allegations thrown at his company.', 'While public relations execs said Huawei’s move to open up media access was a good idea, they emphasized that the company has a hard road ahead.', '“The willingness of its CEO to enter the media spotlight is a positive move, as is its decision to allow media on to its new campus,” said Jonathan Hemus, managing director of crisis communication consultancy Insignia. “However, the sheer magnitude of the allegations against the company renders a charm offensive as, at best, a small step in the right direction.”', 'Such PR exercises alone “cannot restore confidence in Huawei,” Hemus added: “Rebuilding trust requires the business to prove that its integrity is as unimpeachable as it claims.”', 'One of the most serious accusations against the company has come from the U.S. government, which alleges that Huawei’s networking equipment could be used as a backdoor for the Chinese government to access the data of American citizens. Huawei has denied the claim numerous times. But putting Ren in front of media to address the question is a big step.', 'In response to inquiries from CNBC, a representative from Huawei sent a statement attributed to board member Chen Lifang:', 'Some of governments’ mistrust of Huawei has been attributed to CEO Ren’s status as a former member of the People’s Liberation Army and a current member of China’s Communist Party. There have long been questions about the relationship between China’s ruling party and his company, but the tech billionaire emphasized to the assembled reporters that his personal political views would not compromise the protection of his customers.', '“The values of a business entity is customer first, is customer centricity. We are a business organization so we must follow business rules. And in that context I don’t see close connection between my personal political belief and our business actions we are going to take as a business entity. And I think I already made myself very clear right now, we will definitely say no to such a request,” Ren said last week, when asked by CNBC about whether his ties to China’s authoritarian ruling party would stop him from fighting any kind of data request.', 'While Huawei has long been shut out of the American telecommunications networks, it has enjoyed a strong presence in many other nations. But lately, other countries are turning their back on Huawei and blocking the company from being involved in the next generation of networks known as 5G.', 'Also last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. Department of Justice is pursuing a criminal probe of Huawei, alleging that the firm stole trade secrets from its American business partners.', 'Jonathan Bernstein, the president of crisis management firm Bernstein Crisis Management, said it could be a tough task for Huawei to repair its reputation while bad news continues to come out.', '“It is literally impossible to start turning around a reputation when it’s still getting damaged by new allegations and developments in various investigations,” Bernstein told CNBC by email. “The best option right now is minimizing damage, and it appears that’s what Huawei is trying to do, belatedly.”', '“Global media, categorically, are unlikely to change their editorial content about Huawei just because they’ve been given the kind of consideration they should have been given all along,” he added.', 'More generally, Hemus said that overall trust in the company would develop more from a consistent approach, not a one-off media strategy.', '“Time will tell whether Huawei has the stomach to make a long-term commitment to the business behaviors and open communication required to re-build its reputation,” he said.', 'However, Bernstein added that Huawei shipped more than 200 million smartphones in 2018, growing a little more than 30 percent despite an overall slow market. Huawei is also expected to hit over $100 billion revenue in 2018, and Ren said that the firm would still see growth in 2019, but it would be under 20 percent in 2019 because of “challenges and difficulties in international markets.”', 'Huawei is getting set to release its first foldable 5G-enabled smartphone this year and is working on futuristic products like augmented reality glasses.

36,The great Silicon Valley land grab,2017-08-24T16:16:49+0000,"['The city of East Palo Alto, a wedge of modest houses and light industrial sites in the heart of Silicon Valley, has been passed by in the great tech boom. A historically black area, it has seen a big Hispanic influx in the past two decades, with more than three out of four residents now coming from one of those two groups. It is still living down its reputation, gained a quarter of a century ago, as the murder capital of the US: one out of every 571 of its residents was the victim of a homicide in a single year.', 'Things have improved since then. But over the same period, it has become the poor neighbour to some of the world’s richest companies. In one of the ultimate signs of the divide between the haves and have-nots of the western US, the municipal government of East Palo Alto didn’t own the rights to draw more from the state’s water reserves, which it would need in order to grow. In June this year, it took a gift of cash, from the private foundation set up by Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, to buy the rights from a richer neighbouring town.', 'Zuckerberg’s personal interest in the area is understandable. Immediately to the north, his ever-expanding Facebook campus looms, a shining city alongside the salt marshes of the San Francisco Bay. With its Frank Gehry-designed buildings, ecologically sound roofs and free cafeterias, the company hugs the border of East Palo Alto like an ocean liner docked on the edge of an undeveloped country.', 'To the south, a 15-minute bike ride down the Bay Trail — a track that is in the process of being extended to connect the Valley’s islands of tech privilege — Google has just broken ground on a big headquarters expansion of its own. With its green credentials very much in mind, the first building the company has constructed from the ground up will be a futuristic affair with a giant canopied roof to collect rainwater and generate solar power.', 'For the residents of East Palo Alto, each new building the tech industry throws up, bringing with it thousands more software developers, adds to the encroaching gentrification — and gives another turn of the screw to the housing crisis the city shares with much of Silicon Valley.', '“We were appalled what [Facebook] were proposing to build — some very small amount of housing, and bringing in 6,000 employees,” says Tameeka Bennett, of the latest big campus expansion. A community activist who grew up in East Palo Alto, she says that it was hard to get the company to address the impact of its headlong growth. “We tried the nice way,” she says. “They shot us down.”', 'Silicon Valley likes to think of itself as a harbinger of the future: not just a model for a new economy and a new way of working, but for a new social contract. At a time when the US is in a paroxysm of tribal discord, the tech industry’s young leaders promote themselves as the vanguard of an enlightened new generation.', 'Their industry welcomes immigrants: nearly three out of every four workers aged between 25-45 and employed in technical jobs in the area were born outside the US, according to Silicon Valley Index, an annual analysis of the region. Highway 101, the artery that connects the area’s cities, spreading 50 miles to the south of San Francisco, is replete with Teslas — although, in the current boom, most are likely to be idling in a traffic jam.', 'But to judge from what’s happening on tech’s own doorstep, there is nothing to be complacent about. San Francisco itself is in the midst of a contentious spurt of growth, bringing an influx of tech workers into the city’s poorer districts and pushing out Hispanics and African-Americans. Now, Silicon Valley, where the tech industry spreads out through a string of faceless office parks, is starting to show the tension too.', 'As space-age architecture edges closer to streets where homeless people sleep in their cars, the concept of two Americas is becoming painfully visible: one whose citizens have wealth, privilege and 21st-century skills; the other in which people are surviving day to day, facing arduous commutes or insecure housing if they are to make ends meet.   The price of the median home in East Palo Alto, at nearly $800,000, is still far below prices in neighbouring towns. But it has spiked from just $277,000 in 2012, after the real-estate bust. Long-time residents are being forced out; software developers are moving in. Bennett, 30, counts herself among the displaced.', 'After losing her home to foreclosure during the housing crisis, she moved to Oakland, across the bay. Some bitterness shows, as she talks of the “different faces, and baby strollers jogging by” on the East Palo Alto streets these days. But she resists the pressure for more militant opposition, which she says is how some want to respond, in favour of co-operation with the rich new neighbours.', '“I’m of a new generation. We are at a point when we have to try something new, or all of our communities are going to change,” says Bennett. “We’re walking cautiously down this path. How do we hold big companies accountable in low-income communities?”', '“People all over the world are watching what will happen in Silicon Valley,” adds Salimah Hankins, a lawyer who represents tenants at risk of being displaced by the onrush of the tech giants. “I do give Facebook some credit. They do in general terms accept the impact tech is having. But it’s been a long road.”', 'It is an uneasy cohabitation. It took a lawsuit from the city of East Palo Alto to get the social-networking company to consider ways to mitigate the effects of its whirlwind growth. The result was an $18.5m grant to build affordable housing for people on low incomes.', 'But even leveraging that up with other cash will probably bring only 200 housing units, says Carlos Romero, an East Palo Alto council member and resident for more than 35 years. Estimates put the number of new jobs — many of them low paid — that are created indirectly for each new tech worker at between two and five, adding to the housing squeeze and greatly magnifying the impact of tech expansion.', '“The narrative that has been preferred by these corporations is that it’s all because of their largesse. But they were coerced to the table,” says Romero. “When all is said and done, it doesn’t address one 150th of the impact that the size of these developments will have.”', 'After nine years, Celia Cucalon, 56, is about to be evicted from her cramped, 300 sq ft studio apartment in Burlingame, a city between San Francisco and Palo Alto. A housekeeper and carer for elderly people in the area, she had been paying $1,035 a month in rent. But her building — which has five small apartments — was sold, and a few months ago the new landlord handed her a shock: a rent increase to $2,250, along with notice to leave in 60 days.', 'The rent inflation is a symptom of the speculators who are pouring into the area to cash in on tech money, says Hankins, the lawyer who has represented Cucalon. The building where Cucalon lives was last sold in 1996, for $340,000; this year it was listed at $1.475m. The chance to “re-tenant” the building with highly paid tech workers has driven up its value. Cucalon’s neighbours included a gardener, a restaurant worker and a medical assistant. Soon, they will all be gone.', '“House cleaners, nurses, servers in restaurants — they don’t earn that amount of money,” she says. “People who are taking care of the elderly and working in restaurants, they can’t afford to live here. Who is going to clean the houses in these areas?”', 'The tech industry is already under fire for a lack of ethnic diversity. While an influx of workers from India and east Asia has fed the Valley’s need for technical talent, other minorities are severely under-represented. For the region, the housing crisis will make the problem worse. “It’s disproportionately affecting Latinos and African-Americans,” says Hankins. “It has implications not only for the socio-economic mix but racial as well.” Of the district where Cucalon lives, Hankins adds: “Is it becoming a county where only if you’re wealthy and white you can live here?”', 'The housing crisis that is forcing Cucalon out has been decades in the making. Today’s Silicon Valley was carved out of a rich agricultural land of apricot and almond orchards. At the time the tech companies started to emerge, the region’s cities followed a simple plan: bring in jobs, not houses. This development bias is part of the legacy of California’s notorious Proposition 13, the 1978 referendum that saw the state’s voters severely circumscribe the ability of local governments to increase their property taxes. With little income to be had from homeowners, towns have instead relied on other sources of income, such as sales taxes. New offices also bring cash — without the attendant need to build more schools or take on other social costs.', 'It is the formula that produced the Californian dream. A neat ranch house on a small grassy lot and a commute down the highway to work in some faceless, sun-washed office park. But with the latest tech boom — as traffic clogs the highways and a shortage of housing makes it hard even for well-paid software developers to own a home — the old dream, for many, has evaporated.', '“People laugh when you travel around the country and say we have too many jobs,” says Lenny Siegel, the vice-mayor of Mountain View, where Google is based. “It can’t go on indefinitely. But it’s not showing any sign of slowing down.” ', 'Silicon Valley has long been a place of bubbles and busts, but something has changed. It is now in the midst of a long boom that depends heavily on a handful of globe-spanning tech giants, each of them rich enough to ride out any dips. The romantic local myth still holds that the next big idea is already being dreamt up in some Silicon Valley garage. But Facebook and Google have shown themselves adept at buying up whatever dreams they haven’t been able to crush.', '“We aren’t a start-up place any more,” says Stephen Levy, a local economist, of the dominant forces driving the tech economy. “We’re a big-company-dominated place. And these companies have very deep pockets.” The latest boom, running since the real-estate crisis, has already beaten the odds, he says. “There has not been a correction here — and there may not be.”', 'In the headlong race to grow, the campuses of the tech titans are turning into sprawling empires. The developments that Facebook has on the drawing board will take the number of workers in its complex of buildings along the Bay to as many as 30,000, estimates Romero, up from around 10,000 now.', 'Google’s plans are even more breathtaking. As well as adding a major extension to its Mountain View HQ, it has rented large parts of Nasa’s Moffett airfield to the south and is spreading like a rash through Sunnyvale, where it has bought up $820m worth of properties. Next in its sights: San Jose, the Valley’s largest city, where the internet search company recently announced plans to turn a ramshackle district of warehouses and car-repair shops into an urban centre. It will hold an estimated 20,000 new workers — as many as Google currently employs in all its Silicon Valley facilities. (Facebook and Google declined to comment for this article.) ', 'But it will take years for developments like these to materialise, not to mention the new transport links on which they will depend. Among the latter is a proposed urban hub linking high-speed rail, local rail and other transport connections — the biggest such project in the western US — to support Google’s giant San Jose expansion.', 'In the meantime, a chronic shortage of housing and poor transport links have sent people into the Californian interior to find homes, and condemned many to long and expensive commutes.', 'Leslye Corsiglia, a former housing director for San Jose, says cities well inland are already feeling the effects of Silicon Valley’s boom, as house prices rise and homelessness spreads. “People are starting to talk about a Bay Area nether region that goes all the way up to Sacramento,” she says, referring to the state capital deep inland.', 'Even professionals are finding it hard to hang on. The planning department for the city of Mountain View recently had 16 new proposals before it, 13 of them to add more homes, says vice-mayor Siegel. But the department said it could not take any of the projects on: an inability to hire town planners meant it was already overworked. “We need more housing for planners,” he says.', 'These pressures are causing a political shift, and forging unlikely alliances. Siegel describes himself as the last person to take a corporatist view of the world. He attended the Democratic party’s presidential convention last summer as a delegate for Bernie Sanders. But he is now counting on an alliance with the tech industry to make up for years of under-investment in housing. ', 'With its continued expansion at risk, Google, for its part, is getting into the housing business. It wants to add nearly 10,000 new homes alongside its headquarters extension, although it faces some opposition from a city council concerned about the impact on traffic of such rapid development. ', 'There have been other new alignments of interests. In the early 1980s, Siegel was among those agitating, unsuccessfully, for Mountain View to adopt rent control, to protect its low-income workers. It turned out to be the high-water mark of California’s rent-control movement: East Palo Alto, along with a handful of major centres such as San Francisco, adopted the protections. Then the idea fell off the political map for a generation.', 'The Bay Area’s homeowners — not usually predisposed to welcome anything that might depress real-estate values — are now coming around to the idea that rent control may be a good idea after all. When their children can’t afford to live in the area and they are worried about a lack of teachers, nurses and cleaners, the concept of regulation can suddenly sound appealing. Late last year, voters in Mountain View and Richmond backed rent control. Other local cities are weighing up similar proposals.', 'Artificially holding down prices can’t, however, make up for a severe shortage. Getting companies such as Google to help fill the gap could go some way to addressing the issue. But their interventions have also raised concerns locally about the rise of new company towns under the sway of the Valley’s giant corporations, says Siegel.', 'Those fears are overblown. The housing that Google hopes to build on land it owns — like the 1,500 homes recently proposed by Facebook to go alongside a development of its own — would be made available to anyone. Fifteen per cent of Facebook’s new housing units, and 20 per cent of Google’s, would be designed for low-income residents.', 'But it will take years for projects such as these to be approved and built. And, given the sheer scale of the expansion that is planned — and the low proportion of subsidised accommodation — it will still be a case of too little, too late.', 'This points to a troubling future for America’s tech heartland. The combination of the region’s ageing, rich homeowners and a shortage of new housing will inevitably lead to a slowdown in jobs creation, reckons Levy, who runs the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy. “By 2025, you won’t have a lot of 75-year-olds who are working,” he says. The Valley is already worried about the impact of greater restrictions on US immigration. Add to that inadequate development, and the dynamism that has underpinned Silicon Valley’s success could stall.', 'Robert Aguirre, a former electronics engineer, is homeless again. Now in his sixties, he refers to the condition, with a philosophical shrug, as being “unhoused”. Demand for the kind of work that he specialised in, involving the testing of communications equipment, was shipped abroad years ago.', 'He has had two longer periods without a roof over his head before, one of which lasted a year and a half. For the past month, since being evicted, he has been sleeping on the streets of San Jose in a borrowed car while trying to find new digs. He makes it sound like no big deal. “If someone complains, the police ask you to move,” he says. “If not, they leave you alone.”', 'In the Valley, homelessness has become a suburban complaint. Lines of battered RVs line certain streets in places such as Mountain View, where the courts have said they can park for 72 hours at a time. The cities don’t even enforce those relaxed rules, as they try to come to grips with an issue that has become endemic. The cars and campers of the unhoused have also started appearing overnight in the parking lots of the region’s shopping malls.', 'For some of the Valley’s low-paid workers, there are few alternatives. “It’s not your pierced, drug-dealing, bipolar, downtrodden homeless,” says Siegel. “It’s the employed.”', 'In the shadow of the tech industry’s extreme wealth, the plight of the swelling ranks of the homeless — who now number some 7,000 in Santa Clara county, by some counts more even than in San Francisco — arouses a strong reaction.', 'Critics point out that the big tech companies like to think of themselves as socially progressive, adopting moralistic mission statements that often involve changing the world — with the unspoken promise that it will be for the better. But they have failed to deal with a problem that is spreading in their own backyard.', 'Sandy Perry is a minister at a church organisation set up to tackle homelessness in San Jose. He is driven by a deep religious conviction and, invoking the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr, considers housing a civil rights issue. “If you have resources, you’re responsible for taking care of your fellow human beings,” he says. “A lot of what [King] stood for is not remembered today — certainly not by the tech companies.” Instead of contributing to affordable housing, they “don’t pay their fair share of taxes, they park the money overseas”. ', 'According to opponents like Perry, technology, rather than offering solutions to these problems, is making things worse. It has already contributed to the fragmentation of society, but the coming wave of automation will also wipe out. many types of work. This, he argues, is partly why tech companies already treat their low-paid workers and contractors as expendable.', 'What money there is can seem like a drop in the bucket. Kevin Zwick, head of the non-profit Housing Trust Silicon Valley, has raised $20m so far from local companies via a bond issue to back low-income housing development. But he struggles to hide his frustration. “These companies have a lot of capital that they could invest in affordable housing if they wanted to,” he says.', 'He takes a stab at estimating how much spare cash the biggest tech companies are sitting on — and, guessing $50bn, undershoots by a factor of 10 — before adding: “If you just sliced off a per cent of that — that type of money would easily create tens of thousands of units through the Greater Bay Area.”', 'Apple, the richest company in the world, with $262bn of cash and investments, arouses the strongest reactions from the industry’s critics. Larry Stone, who as county assessor is responsible for coming up with the valuations on which property taxes are based, bristles at what he claims are the company’s hardball tactics on agreeing assessments.', 'But he is even more incensed by its lack of support for its local community — the kind of thing he says traditional companies used to care about. “I can’t stand cheapskates,” he says. “The largest company in the world could and should do more. They’re just not a community-oriented company. They should be giving to transportation, to education, they should be supporting non-profits for housing, social services.”', 'Apple says that it is “the largest contributor to the local economy”, and is “supporting schools and public works projects across the Santa Clara Valley”. It adds: “Cupertino has been Apple’s home for more than 40 years and we are proud to have a strong relationship with the community here.”', 'The fact that Facebook and Google have made housing part of their development plans shows they recognise that some action is needed — not least to protect their own businesses by not pricing future workers out of the market. This year, Google has taken the first step towards building homes directly for its own workers, with plans to put up 300 temporary apartments at Moffett Field. But even so it is impossible to deal with the full impact of the company’s surging growth. Says Siegel: “Google has done just about everything they could to solve these problems — except not grow.”', 'According to Bennett in East Palo Alto, Facebook representatives invoked Zuckerberg’s old motto — “Move Fast and Break Things” — when sitting down with local community leaders to discuss how to deal with the problems of gentrification.', '“I hate that,” she says. “While we need to move moderately fast, we don’t have the luxury of breaking things. Families are living this life and in danger of losing their homes.”', 'The difficult social and economic issues caused by the tech giants’ colossal success seem unlikely to bend to the kind of technocratic solutions their leaders often adopt. According to Stone, it will require something else — the kind of commitment to supporting local communities that, he says, Boeing showed in Seattle when he was growing up.', 'To him, the tech corporations seem more like insular empires than companies with deep ties to their local neighbourhoods. “The problem with this place is, most people come from somewhere else,” he says. “People in this area don’t have identity.

New regulations mandated by the 2010 Manila  Convention mean all hands on deck, or below, need added training  and more days at sea.

', '“If  they don’t spend the money to allow the sales transfer to  occur…they risk losing traffic and market share,” he said. “If they  invest appropriately...it doesn’t necessarily result in an increase  in sales, therefore reducing margins and return on capital.”', '  Below are five ways that the growth in online shopping can be a  drag on retailers’ profits.', '  Online sales are already breaking records this holiday,  including desktop revenue that topped $2 billion for the first time on Cyber Monday, according to ComScore. But as more people make purchases online,  retailers are saddled with higher shipping  costs, particularly as consumers have come to expect free  shipping offers.', '  According to a study by Pitney Bowes, which advises retailers on  shipping practices, 82 percent of U.S. shoppers consider free shipping most important; by comparison, only 17 percent prefer fast shipping. Additionally, one in  three respondents said they’ve abandoned an online order sometime in the past  year due to prohibitive shipping costs.', ' Read MoreFingers crossed: Retailers allow late  orders', 'Many retailers over the past few months have either  lowered their minimum order threshold, or offered free shipping.  Wal-Mart, for example, offered free shipping for one day last  week, while Target has offered free delivery for online orders  for nearly two months. That offer ends Dec. 20.', '  “Shipping offers are critical to customers and are especially  important during the holiday season,” said Forrester Research  analyst Sucharita Mulpuru. “However, these offers are costly and  eat into retailer margins.” ', '  These costs will become even more significant toward the end of  2014 and into next year, when carriers UPS and FedEx will  begin charging by size, not just weight. One way retailers are  combating these costs is by offering buy online, pick up in-store  options. ', '  Many of the initial headwinds related to online shopping are  operational in nature, said Stephen Mader, director of retail  insights at Kantar Retail. ', '  For one, shoppers expect retailers’ websites to carry the  same, if not more, products than they have in store. For  another, it can be challenging for retailers to sync up their  digital and in-store inventory networks, to ensure their products  are in the right place at the right time.', '  Not only are these issues challenging, but they can also be  costly.', '“To get this right and to organize it so that you really have  that seamless experience is a really hard thing to do,” said  Christoph Stehmann, president of e-commerce and shipping  solutions at Pitney Bowes. ', '  Other operational challenges include ensuring on-time delivery of  online orders, particularly during the holidays, and  making sure retailers’ desktop and mobile sites are optimized to  handle heavy volume. On Black Friday, for example, Best Buy experienced outages that it attributed to volume.', '  It’s no coincidence that retailers litter the path to the cash  register with low-ticket items, or put popular items in the back so shoppers have to weave their way through the store. But online  buyers tend to be more targeted in their purchases, seeking  the best deal on a particular item, and are less  likely to spontaneously add extra items to their cart.', '  What’s more, because online shoppers have typically invested less  time and energy into their search than is required by  visiting a store, they’re more likely to shift their  attention away from a particular retailer, Mader said.', ' Read MoreRetail snapshot: Who’s winning on and  offline', '  “Online you’re always one click away from failure,” he said.', '  According to Pitney Bowes, nearly half of U.S. shoppers have  returned an online purchase through the mail. That means  retailers are paying not only to send goods out to  consumers, but they’re often paying for the package to come back  into their distribution network.', '  Kantar’s Mader said apparel orders are particularly susceptible  to returns, as fit can vary by brand or by item. The problem is  exacerbated by the fact that many shoppers order two sizes right off  the bat, knowing that they’ll return the one that doesn’t fit. ', ' Read MoreWant a jolly Christmas? These five  things must change', '  “That’s a lot of inventory which exists out in the public’s hands, which you need to account for,” Mader said.', '  Pitney Bowes’ Stehmann said retailers can significantly cut back  on these costs by giving more detail about a product—for example, a size conversion chart. He said he recently spoke with a small e-commerce company in Germany that  lowered its return rates from 50 percent to about 25 percent, just  by better describing its items.', '  “Twenty-five percent less returns makes a major difference,” he said.', '  The digital shift has made it easier for shoppers to  price compare. While that’s great news for consumers, it’s not so  great for retailers, particularly those who carry the same items as their competitors. ', '  This results in companies slashing their prices, in what pricing firm 360pi has called a race to the bottom. But this online transparency isn’t only tied  to price tags, Mader said. Shoppers can quickly skim companies’ websites to  see who offers same-day delivery, pick-up in store or other  convenient fulfillment options, creating another arena in which retailers compete.', '  “Pricing is only one component of the shopper’s value equation,”  Mader said.']"

46,Toys R Us’ poor holiday sales cast doubts on its future,2018-01-30T20:31:49+0000,"['Holiday sales this past year ballooned, but those riches didn’t extend to Toys R Us. The bankrupt toy store missed significantly on every number that mattered, sources say, likely forcing the retailer to renegotiate key lending terms.', 'Sales were down more than hoped as was traffic and the amount of toys in stock it got out the door. Meanwhile, its profits were squeezed as Amazon and big-box retailers Target and Walmart slashed prices to reel in customers. For these retailers, toys could act as bait, with the hope that once shoppers came for the toys they would also purchase other items with higher profit margins. Toys R Us doesn’t have any such buffer. ', 'Toys R Us discounted roughly 10 percent more of its products in holiday 2017 compared with the prior year, according to Market Track. The company had a “material miss” on its holiday sales, said a person familiar with the results. This at the same time Amazon said it had its best year across the board.', 'The poor holiday numbers may require Toys R Us to renegotiate the terms of its debt with its lenders, sources say. They will hover over Toys R Us as it works with debtholders over the next couple of weeks to draft its plans for moving forward. The lenders will have to determine if the Toys R Us business plan is supportable, said the sources.', 'Toys R Us needs help from debtholders and the largest toy companies — Mattel and Hasbro — in order to emerge from bankruptcy protection by the summer as planned, sources say.

', 'Toys R Us filed for bankruptcy in September, weighed down by $4.9 billion in debt. Those obligations were a vestige of its $6.6 billion acquisition by , Bain Capital Partners and real estate investment trust Vornado Realty Trust in a 2005.', 'Under bankruptcy protection, the retailer had thought it would be afforded the financial flexibility to drive its turnaround. Toys R Us is opening “play labs” to make its stores more “experiential,” a favorite buzzword among retailers trying to create reasons for shoppers to come through the door. ', 'But the challenges for Toys R Us may be more fundamental than investors had thought.', 'Shopping habits have materially changed, as parents flock to Amazon and other online vendors. ', 'For brick-and-mortar retailers, it isn’t as easy as simply investing in e-commerce. It is expensive to build out an effective online platform, and it is costly to ship items. When shoppers buy online, a store also can miss out on impulse buys shoppers are more likely to make in the store. ', 'Meantime, toys don’t have the appeal that they used to, as children look elsewhere to gadgets for entertainment, one of the season’s top performers.', '“What’s the advantage of having a store [devoted to one thing] unless you have something to go to that place for. Toys doesn’t do it anymore,” said Gerrick Johnson, an equity analyst at BMO Capital Markets.', 'Toy woes have carried over to Mattel and Hasbro, both of whom have already been battered by Toys R Us’ bankruptcy. Mattel in October suspended its quarterly dividend and its bonds have since been downgraded by credit ratings agency Moody’s. Mattel in particular has struggled to evolve from its Barbie past.', '“Mattel’s business (desperately) needs reinvestment in order to stimulate sales growth and engage consumers on a sustained basis. Brands are tired and lack relevance in a millennial parent led marketplace,” wrote analysts at Jefferies this November.', 'The theory has long been that Mattel and Hasbro will unconditionally support Toys R Us by continuing to ship goods and offering flexible financial terms, because the retailer is so intrinsic to the health of the toy industry. Toys R Us sells more toys year-round than its competitors and discounts less.', 'But as challenges deepen, it has become a vicious circle: the toymakers need Toys R Us to support the industry, but the industry has become so weak they may not have the strength to prop it up.

Target at that time lowered its guidance for the fiscal year, citing a “difficult” retail  environment.', 'While sales across the industry remain challenging, particularly in categories like apparel, a flurry of holiday forecasts are calling for growth between 3 and 4 percent. The National Retail Federation predicts revenue will grow at a faster clip in November and December, rising 3.6 percent.', 'Like the NRF, Target CEO Brian Cornell pointed to a healthier economic backdrop — which includes low fuel prices and more robust employment — as two signs that shoppers will be ready to spend this holiday.', '  “I think we’re entering the holiday season with a consumer who is  feeling good about the state of play,” Cornell said.

', 'Target’s blanket free shipping offer helped the retailer notch a  34 percent increase in its digital sales last holiday. Starting  Tuesday, the company will once again eliminate its minimum  spending requirement to qualify for free shipping. And because  Hanukkah runs though Jan. 1, Target will extend this promotion an  additional week this season, to end on New Year’s Day. This  should help relieve stress on both customers and its systems,  Cornell said.', '  The company has meanwhile rolled out the ability to ship from its  stores to an additional 600 locations, to shorten its delivery  window. And with 35 percent of its online orders getting picked  up in-store, Target has built more clear, attractive signs to  signal these areas to shoppers. ', '  “Last year we saw a huge surge leading up to Christmas,” Cornell  said. “We expect the same type of surge this year.”', 'Electronics weighed heavily on Target’s revenue during the fiscal  second quarter, with comparable sales in the category sliding  double digits. That included a 20 percent dip in Apple products.', '  Target is trying to breathe life back into the category this  holiday by highlighting virtual reality products  including PlayStation VR  and VR One Plus, as well as new connected-home products  such as Google Home.  It’s also invested heavily into Apple products, including the new  Apple Watch.', 'Since Cornell came on board at Target, he’s focused on bringing  back some of the “wow” factor the brand lost when it focused too  much on price. But he has admitted this year that the  company’s messaging has now skewed too far away from value.', '  While style will still take a front seat in much of its messaging  this holiday, 60 percent of its marketing will be focused on  value. That’s an increase of about 20 percent from last holiday.  As part of this initiative, Target will offer $10 off a $50  purchase in a different category each week, including home and  apparel.', '  It will also repeat a promotion that offers a deal on a different  item for 10 days, and highlight more low-price items at the end  of its aisles.', 'When Target rebranded the low-cost merchandise featured at the front  of its stores into Bullseye’s Playground, comparable sales in the  area grew more than 25 percent over the prior year. ', '  Target is once again tapping into that strategy with an upgraded  presentation for its seasonal items, which it’s dubbed  “Wondershop.” These shop-in-shops will sell 2,000 new holiday  products starting Nov. 1.', '  Fresh off its best year in more than a decade, Target is playing  up its home decor and entertainment categories, in an  attempt to make its stores a one-stop shop for party  planning. ', '  It’s also added 1,000 new products to its Cat & Jack kids’  apparel line, which launched in July and has been posting  double-digit growth “week after week,” the company said.']"

The Pacific Maritime  Assocation, which represents employers, claimed longshoremen  began holding back crews after Halloween in order to pressure  employers, while the International Longshore and Warehouse Union,  representing dockworkers, claimed the opposite, saying that  employers are asking for only half the normal work  crews.

One such missile, the  DF-21D, is commonly known as the carrier killer. Security  analysts believe another, the secretive DF-26C, has enough range  to reach U.S. airbases on the Central Pacific island of Guam, thousands of kilometers away.', '  While China’s growing military capability has not erupted into a  regional arms race, it has impacted priorities in the region. This  year Japan passed measures allowing it to take a greater military  role in overseas conflicts, while proposing its largest national  defense budget ever — largely to augment its naval and island  defense capabilities. The U.S. is easing a longstanding arms  embargo on Vietnam, sending new naval patrol vessels to the  Philippines and considering reopening air and naval bases  there.

Following China’s two-decade military buildup,  such brazen displays of deterrent power are less likely.

So we’re  moving the same oil. Instead of a two-week voyage from West  Africa to Philadelphia, we’re going from West Africa to China and  India.” ', '  Voyages to Asia are longer hauls, and can be a big catalyst for  rates.

62,"Amid oil price plunge, Alaska’s economy braces for losers and survivors",2016-04-21T14:03:59+0000,"['  Alaska’s $3.5 billion deficit — roughly two-thirds of its  budget — reads like a classic boom-bust tale. With the  collapse in crude prices, lower oil revenues are hitting Alaska  hard. Roughly 90 percent of the state government and one-third of  all state jobs comes from oil money.   ', '  But weaning Alaska off oil revenues won’t be a straight shot. And  the pain won’t be uniform.', '  The effects of budget solutions will vary among Alaska’s diverse  population. In many ways, the Last Frontier State is a collection  of regions and micro economies — each with its own  constellation of employers and local price swings for everything,  from a gallon a milk to a gallon of fuel.  ', '  With most of the money used to pay for state government gone in  just fours years, according to regional economists, the state is  considering a personal income tax proposal for the first time in 35 years.  There’s talk of reducing annual dividend checks from a state  savings fund, when oil money was flush.', '  “Dividend cuts would take more from poor people than rich people  because rich people would pay less taxes if their dividend was  cut,” said Gunnar Knapp, a top economist on the region at  the Institute of Social and Economic Research at the University  of Alaska Anchorage. On the other hand, “an income tax would put  the burden of paying for new revenue on the highest income  Alaskans.” ', '  Beyond oil and gas, the engine of Alaska’s economy runs on other  major industries, including tourism, fisheries, mining, forestry  and corporations led by Alaska Native populations. But those  sector drivers might not be enough in the face of lower oil  revenues.', '  Existing industries and regional economies are spread across a  state that’s massive in geographic scale. Imagine superimposing a  map of Alaska over a map of the U.S. If Alaska’s westernmost  point were in San Francisco, its easternmost edge would stretch  like a vast web, all the way to Florida. Alaska is twice as large  as Texas. ', '  The state population of 730,000 residents is varied, too.  Anchorage houses about 41 percent of the state’s residents,  leaving the majority of Alaskans in towns, villages and clustered  settlements. ', '  Some areas are extremely remote, reachable only by small planes  and boats. They operate in a near-cashless, subsistence economy,  anchored by fishing and hunting. This is a vastly different  quality of life than a worker at Costco in Anchorage, or an employee at  one of the city’s malls that feature big brands like  Sephora, Starbucks andMichael Kors.', '  So while the prospects of budget cutbacks may trigger smaller  class sizes in schools in the capital, Juneau, less money to fund  state government can mean closing entire schools or hospitals for  more remote communities.', '  “The state is huge. Huge,” said Knapp. “And the economies are  very much regionalized.”', '  Originally from Maryland, Knapp, then 27, moved to Alaska for  economics. Some 35 years later and 62, he has raised a family and  has seen the shifts that came with the last big downturn in the  1980s. Residents moved and uprooted families for access to jobs  and services.', '  “A lot of people remember the ’80s and wonder if we’ll see the  same thing,” he said. ', '  Long-time Alaskans remember many feast-famine periods. The  boom in the mid-1970s with the construction of the trans-Alaska  oil pipeline. Then came a recession, followed by a  government-spending and construction-fueled boom in the 1980s.', '  Like an actor promoting a movie release, Knapp has a busy  schedule of appearances. Repeatedly and with patience, he  objectively explains the state’s fiscal options. His audience is  diverse: the state legislature, chambers of commerce, economic  development groups, the Alaska Federation of Natives,  churches.', '  “The first question I got was, ‘When should I sell my house?’”  said Knapp, recalling a gathering a few weeks ago. “There’s a lot  of concern,” he said. “Most people are not economists, and all  they know is there’s a real serious fiscal problem.”', '  Beyond the pie charts and bar graphs of fallen oil prices and oil  production that’s leaving the state, there’s a wariness among  Alaskans. Many of them are independent and risk takers. You have  to survive and thrive in a terrain where chores like getting food  and fuel can take hours if not days. The cost of living is high  as goods are shipped from the Lower 48 states. Every task seems  difficult. And that’s a fair bargain, say residents who prefer  sparse populations and the region’s beauty. ', ' Read MorePainful transition for  energy states as oil revenues evaporate', '  Now the state’s unique regional diversity — the very  essence of what lured and anchors them to Alaska — threatens  to make the unraveling of oil money a painful and uneven  experience. ', '  “It’s one of the things that really hasn’t been discussed a lot,”  says Mouhcine Guettabi, assistant professor of economics at the  institute. “We’re not just one, homogeneous place.” ', '  Regions with job and industry diversity are poised to better  withstand the coming budget cuts. Says Guettabi: “The diversity  of the sources of money and the reliance on government will  determine the winners and losers.”', '  Besides oil and gas, Alaska runs on other major industries, including tourism that continues to grow. Nearly a million  visitors arrived in Alaska by cruise ship in 2014, according to  the Resource Development Council for Alaska, a statewide business association.', '  Tourism is the second-largest private sector employer, and  accounts for 1 in 8 Alaskan jobs. Direct visitor  spending is more than $1.8 billion annually, excluding fares paid  to travel. And 1 in 3 Alaska visitors are repeat visitors.', '  A higher sales tax could deter visitors and local spending and  place the burden of filling the budget gap on nonresidents.  That’s in contrast to dividend cuts that would come out of  Alaskans’ pocketbooks, said Knapp.', '  As the budget gets hammered out in Juneau, small business  owner Erica Pryzmont is as busy as ever.', '  She’s the owner and operator of Pingo Bakery-Seafood House  in Nome that’s located on the western edge of the state.  Nome’s population of around 3,800 expands three fold for the end  to the annual Iditarod sled dog race finish line in March.  “For our business, it’s like having another month of summer-like  business but packed into a week and a half,” she said.', '  Is Pryzmont worried about the state budget? “I still  get up and go to work. It’s not going to change my daily  schedule.” ', '  She’s too busy baking apricot, pistachio white chocolate chip  cookies and coconut cinnamon rolls.', '  Pryzmont’s savory specialties include roasted halibut pizza and a  Norton Sound Red King Crab Leg section, when crab is in season.  For now, Pryzmont says local seafood prices have been holding  steady. She sources her food through local fisherman and  fisheries.', '  “Fishermen have been getting good prices for crab,” she said.', 'Many in Alaska have a deep connection to fishing given the state’s abundance of lakes, rivers and coastline. Alaska is the only  state to have coastlines on three different seas: the Arctic and Pacific oceans and Bering Sea. More than half  of the nation’s commercially harvested fish come from Alaska.', '  The state also benefits from what’s known as “back haul” for  shippers that primarily bring goods and supplies north to Alaska. One major  shipping company estimates freight rates to the state would be 10  percent higher without the back haul of seafood shipped out of  Alaska, according to Resource Development Council.', '  More than $3 billion in fish and shellfish was harvested in state  waters in 2011, as a reference point. Seafood is also a top  export commodity. And in some pockets of the state, fish  harvesting and processing are the only sources of private sector  jobs, especially in coastal communities.', '  Bigger picture, Knapp stresses prices for seafood like  salmon ultimately are set in the global markets. But in the  near term, budget cuts could lead to more conservative management  of fisheries, which receive state funding. “We could potentially  have less, well managed fisheries,” he said. In the fiscal year  2016 general fund budget, about $66 million is earmarked for fish  and game spending, according to institute data.', '  Beyond income and sales taxes, state leaders are discussing other  potential new sources of state revenue, including raising taxes on the fisheries and mining industries.', ' Many of Alaska’s roads and docks were originally  constructed to serve mining. The sector produces  zinc, lead, copper, gold, silver, coal, as well as construction  minerals such as sand, gravel and rock. Direct and indirect jobs  total about 9,100, generating $630 million in payroll, according to the Resource Development Council.', '  As lawmakers hash out budget details, oil price fluctuations  already are being felt in local economies.', '  Alaska Native artist Robert Miller owns and operates Sea Fur  Sewing, based in Sitka. ', '  He produces handmade, custom items including hats and gloves made  from sea otters’ dense fur and seals’ skin for waterproof  qualities. ', '  As a Tlingit Indian from the Kiksadi clan,  Miller is legally allowed to produce and sell finished products  made of marine mammal fur under federal laws. He learned the  craft from his grandmother. Miller can boast that four-time  Iditarod champion Lance Mackey has worn hat and gloves he has  made.', '  In and around Sitka, Miller can see the impact of oil  price swings first-hand as he interacts with local hunters. Some  hunters can spend hours on 16-foot skiff boats that can require  lots of fuel. Alaska has some of the most expensive gasoline  prices in the country, along with California.', '  The average fuel price in Alaska is around $2.33 a gallon  compared with a high of $4.70 in July 2008, according  to AAA. But Miller and other  business owners say fuel prices can fluctuate depending on where  you live.', '  “The hunters in state I pay to hunt for me are from rural  communities in southeast Alaska,” Miller said. “And finding a job  in rural Alaska is difficult unless you work seasonal jobs.”', '  Beyond exposure to local fuel prices, Miller for the most part is  buffered from oil shocks and the possibility of a higher sales  tax. His goods essentially are luxury items. The majority of his  online customers are from the Lower 48 and are willing to pay $500 to $850 for custom hats and gloves, with  specialty items fetching more.', '  “The product I sell, if they want it, they’re going to buy it  anyway,” he said. “It’s a handcrafted, high-end product.”', '  Beyond his one-man online fur business, Miller has a daytime  government job as a fisheries biologist for the U.S. Forest  Service. And if for some reason that government job  disappeared, Sea Fur Sewing could offer a cushion.', '  “I feel a sense of relief that I have my own business and I can  fall back on it full time if I have to,” Miller said.', '  Others residents face all-or-nothing scenarios, with little  sector diversity and most job prospects pegged to the  government.', '  Fourteen of the state’s 29 boroughs have at least 40 percent of  their employment coming from state and local government, said institute economist Guettabi.', '  “There are communities or boroughs that are heavily, heavily  dependent on government,” he said. “So if we are to go through  with some of the cuts that we are currently discussing, then  those communities that don’t have a basic industry that’s driving  them, that’s generating jobs, that’s retaining qualified  individuals, then those communities are going to be considerably  more vulnerable,” Guettabi said.', '  And if there’s no industry diversity and government jobs  disappear, moving for work and services might not be so easy for  some Alaskans.', '  A key difference from the ’80s downturn is expanding households.  Alaskan families have grown to three generations from two. More  Alaskans are 65 and older and are considering staying.', '  “Grandparents staying in state after retirement is fairly new,”  said Guettabi. The average Alaska household size  is 2.7 people, according to state figures. “There’s more  stickiness.”', '  Compare this with North Dakota, where young oil  workers have left “man camps” vacant, as shale oil work has  fallen. Workers have already moved on to the next hot commodity  play.  ', ' Read More How cheap  oil has hit one shale boomtown', '  Uprooting a few kids is easier than relocating a three-generation  household. So the choices for some Alaskan families, if and when  spending cuts are implemented, will be difficult. ', 'Alaska did set up a fund that was intended to outlast the cash-flow erosion that inevitably follows natural resource depletion.  The plan might have even worked — if oil prices hadn’t collapsed by two-thirds in months, and stayed there. So  after some 30 years of mailing out an annual dividend check that recently was around $2,000 for each resident, the oil party is over. In a fresh  script, Alaskans are being asked to reverse course and pay for  the state’s gaping budget hole. ', '  This is a big request for Alaskans, who are used to paying much lower broad-based  state taxes (including individual income and general sales taxes)  than residents of any other state. Connecticut and Hawaii have  the highest broad-based state tax revenues per capita. ', '“In just four years,  most of the money we had been using to pay for state government  evaporated,” Knapp said in a January presentation. “It’s gone. That’s why we have a big problem.”', '  Longer term, the development of an LNG (liquefied natural gas)  export project could lift the economy. If built, the related LNG  projects would be huge, with a combined total cost estimated at $45 billion to $65 billion.', '  If the project proceeds on the currently planned schedule,  construction employment might peak in 2024 and 2025 at about  6,500 jobs, according to Knapp and Guettabi. Subsequent revenues to the state from its project ownership share  and LNG sales could approach $2 billion, further stimulating the  economy over the longer haul.', 'Back in Sitka, all fur designer Miller can do is work and hope for the  best.', '  “I work two jobs, nights and weekends. I don’t know what the next  two, three years will hold. You live day by day and pay your  bills,” said Miller, a husband and father of three.', '  “You take your wife and kids to a restaurant once a week, if  you’re lucky,” he said. “But if it comes to a point you can’t  afford to live here, you’ve got to make those tough choices.”', '  — With data visualization by CNBC Senior Economics  Writer John Schoen.

63,"One industry is holding North America together, no matter what happens with Trump",2017-01-24T18:37:02+0000,"['  President Donald Trump just tightened the ties that bind the  North American energy industry with his push for the Keystone XL  pipeline, making the U.S. potentially less dependent on Middle  Eastern oil.', ' Trump’s advancing of the controversial Keystone  Pipeline comes just as his administration plans to  renegotiate a two-decade-old trade pact with Canada and  Mexico.', '  The president signed an executive order Tuesday advancing  Keystone, as well as the Dakota Access pipeline, both of   which were opposed due to environmental concerns. Keystone  would be a nearly 1,200-mile pipeline that would take about  800,000 barrels a day of Canadian sands oil from Alberta to  Steele City, Nebraska, where it would meet up with a southern leg  of the pipeline that could send it to the Gulf Coast  refineries. ', '  The Dakota Access pipeline would take oil south from the Bakken  in North Dakota.', '  “It’s more likely the additional quantities of oil coming down  from Keystone will be consumed here in the U.S., competing with  alternatives that will be coming from the Middle East,” said  Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. “It’s 10 percent  of our imported demand but Canada is already supplying us with  3.2 million barrels a day.”', '  Canada sands is a “heavy crude,” similar to the crude grade  imported from the Middle East. “We’re still a heavy importer of  crude from Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Kuwait,” said Lipow.', '  Trump, in signing the order, required that American steel be used  in the building of the pipelines, and said the approvals were  subject to renegotiation. But it is the Keystone XL pipeline that  would enhance the already very integrated North American energy  market, by providing a key artery to take Canadian crude that has  been locked in Canada to the Gulf Coast. ', '  The pipeline would be the latest piece of cross-border  infrastructure that ties the U.S., Canada and Mexico together,  all as importers and exporters of energy. ', '  “It’s not only very significant in terms of actual energy trade  but it [Keystone] is very symbolic though in radically different  ways to U.S.-Canadian trade relations and to the environmental  community,” said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS  Markit.', '  “The unbuilt Keystone pipeline achieved the unique status of  becoming the most famous pipeline in the world even though it is  not completed,” he said. ', '  Absent the pipeline, Canadian producers would be forced to send  more crude by rail as they also work on getting alternative  pipelines heading to Canada’s east and west coasts. Canada has  the third largest proven reserves in the world after Saudi Arabia  and Venezuela.', '  Regardless of what happens with the North American Free Trade  Agreement, the U.S., Canada and Mexico have energy ties that  transcend borders and go back decades. ', '  The three countries have intentionally worked to combine the  advantages of their energy resources. Viewed as friendly to the energy  sector, there are still questions about whether the  Trump administration could enact changes that affect the  intricate web of energy connections between the three countries.  The Republican Congress has already proposed a border tax that  could complicate the situation, if approved.', '  While still seen as a low probability, the border adjustment tax  would tax all imports at the border and exports would not be  taxed at all. At the proposed corporate tax rate of 20 percent, a  number of analysts say the border tax would be expected to make  U.S. crude more expensive than international Brent. ', '  Goldman Sachs analysts projected that gasoline prices would jump  as a result by about 30 cents per gallon. The analysts said the  dollar could adjust and move higher over time, reducing the  impact. ', '  “It’s not so simple to say we’re going to renegotiate the trade  deals. We set up the system to create those inter-linkages. You  just can’t overnight legislate or executive order that away. If  you try to do that, it’s going to have negative economic impacts,  not just for the economies on the border but for these specific  industries, like energy,” said Scott Anderson, chief economist at  Bank of the West, in an interview last month.', '  Trump’s selection of  former Texas Gov. Rick Perry as  energy secretary is seen as a positive for the oil and gas  industry. Perry has spoken favorably about North America as a  integrated energy powerhouse, including Mexico and Canada.   ', '  Perhaps one of the most surprising recent developments is the  boom in U.S. natural gas that’s flowing across the southern  border, and the ambitious plans by the Mexican government to  build more pipelines to take U.S. natural gas throughout Mexico  and as far as Mexico City.', '  “Mexico has become a very important market for U.S. gas producers  and without it, we’d be looking at lower prices,” said Yergin.  U.S. producers, grappling with low prices and record winter  supply, would have to cap even more wells if it weren’t for the  growing demand from Mexico, which now accounts for about 5  percent of U.S. natural gas output. ', '  The energy picture changed dramatically for North America in the  last decade. The push by the U.S. energy industry into hydraulic  fracking and horizontal drilling unleashed an energy boom,  making the U.S. the world’s biggest producer of natural gas and  placing it firmly among the top three oil producers.', '  That has changed the situation for all of North America, at a  time when Mexico’s oil and gas output was in decline and Canada  found some of its potential crude output landlocked. The ties  between the three countries go way back. In the early 1900s, the  U.S. began sharing electricity with its neighbors, and Canada is  now a significant net exporter of electricity to the U.S.', '  One catalyst has been Mexico’s program of energy reform, intended  to break the hold of state-owned Pemex on its industry and bring  new private investment to Mexico’s energy industry. The decline  in big part was due to a lack of investment by the government in  Petroleos Mexicanos, and its increasing reliance on Pemex’s  revenue stream for its own budget.', '  “Before shale, the U.S. was importing a lot more gas from  Canada,” said Anthony Yuen, global energy analyst at Citigroup,  in a recent interview. The U.S. was also worried not that long  ago that it would need to import LNG, liquefied natural gas. But  the shale boom changed everything.', '  Yuen said Canadian gas is still important to the U.S. West Coast,  the Midwest and New England, in part because pipelines don’t  carry U.S. gas to those areas. Gas imports from Canada fluctuate  based on weather, and can go from 5 billion to 7 billion cubic  feet a day, he said.', '  “This speaks to how extensive the energy cooperation is between  these countries,” said Yuen. “It’s almost as if the borders  aren’t really there. If you look at Canada and the U.S., they are  part of the same cross-border electricity reliability councils  for some regions. … It’s not just natural gas, it’s power  lines, hydroelectricity and those are long-standing agreements  and trade.”', '  The U.S. energy boom has also been Mexico’s gain, and Mexico, in  turn, has changed the dynamic for the U.S. gas market. “Without  exports to Mexico, the U.S. market would not be where we are  right now. It would be way lower. Producers may not be drilling  as many wells. Without Mexico, it would be tough,” said  Yuen. ', '  According to Citigroup, new cross-border pipeline capacity of 7  billion cubic feet per day is expected to come on line by 2020,  adding to the current capacity of 6 billion to 7 billion cubic feet per  day. Energy Transfer Partners, seeking to build the controversial  Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota, has approval from the  Obama administration to build two pipelines to  take gas from Texas to Mexico.', 'Trump’s pick for energy secretary, Perry, had been on the board of Energy Transfer Partners before resigning.', ' Citigroup said the added pipeline capacity will come as Mexico  undergoes a dramatic build out of power generation capacity and  transmission lines. Mexico’s energy secretary, speaking at an  industry conference in Houston last spring, said there is a 75  percent savings from U.S. natural gas.', '  “Mexico had a pretty high cost of power in the past, because the  country used oil as a power-generation fuel, and natural gas  there is more expensive because of pipeline bottlenecks,” said  Yuen.  “We would not be surprised if exports to Mexico by  2020 by pipeline would still be larger than U.S. LNG exports.”  Liquefied natural gas is currently being shipped from just one  terminal in the United States, but the capacity is expected to  expand.', '  According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. exported 4.2  billion cubic feet per day of natural gas to Mexico, through  pipelines in August. The average daily exports through  August were running at a yearly average of 3.6 billion cubic feet  per day, 25 percent above last year and 85 percent above the  five-year average. The U.S. produces 90 billion cubic feet per  day of natural gas and consumes about 70 billion cubic feet,  according to the Energy Information Administration.', '  Mexican demand can also help offset weather-related declines in  U.S. demand, and for that reason it has helped support the price  of natural gas. ', '  “Mexico can serve as a balance,” said Michael Cohen, head of  commodities energy research at Barclays.  “It’s important  regionally because right now you have a whole bunch of growth in  production in the Northeast, and now you have constraints on that  production getting out. The fact you have Mexican demand  increases can balance out where the supply might come from in the  medium term.”', '  Mexico, in fact, now imports almost as much natural gas from the  U.S. as it produces, and the U.S. in recent months has become a  net exporter of natural gas for the first time in a sustainable  way. ', '  “It could very well be a case where there’s some tweaking around  on [NAFTA], as opposed to a big breakdown. Certainly, I am  concerned a little bit about the Mexican economy. It’s been a big  driver of demand for U.S. gas,” said Francisco Blanch, Bank of  America Merrill Lynch head of global commodities research and  derivatives, in a recent interview. “The supply chains are very well integrated between  the three countries. Changing the rules of the game on account of  NAFTA would be pretty challenging not just for Mexico but for  U.S. companies.”', '  Mexican oil output has been in decline and is now at its lowest  point since the early 1980s. The U.S. is producing about 8.8 million barrels a day of oil, down from a high of 9.6 million  barrels a day last year, a direct result of lower crude  prices. But the U.S. also imports another approximately 8 million barrels a  day, and in September, about 520,000 barrels a day of that came  from Mexico.', '  Canada is the biggest crude exporter to the U.S., sending 3.2  million barrels a day this year to the United States, of the 3.8  million barrels a day it produces, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. CAPP expects Canadian  production to increase to 4.9 million barrels a day by 2030.', '  “People just don’t realize how integrated we are with these two  countries,” said Lipow. The U.S. is now a net exporter of refined  products, and its biggest market for formulated gasoline and  blend stocks is Mexico, which imported 390,000 barrels a day in  September, about a third more than last year. ', '  “Instead of Mexico spending a fortune building new refineries,  they are buying from the U.S., and it turns out energy exports  are now an important contributor to the jobs in our economy,”  said Yergin.', '  Canada, meanwhile, buys some U.S. crude to refine while sending  the U.S. both oil and refined products. The U.S. imported 171,000  barrels per day of finished gasoline and blend stocks and 87,000  barrels a day of diesel fuel. Canada refines the crude in New  Foundland and Nova Scotia.', '  “If it wasn’t coming in, Maine would run dry,” said Lipow. While  it’s not a lot of refined product, the Canadian fuel does supply  gas stations from Maine to Boston. “It’s pretty steady, but the  point is, it keeps coming.”', 'Electricity also flows back and forth over the border, and the  U.S. imports more electricity than it exports. ', '  In a 2015 report, the Department of Energy said there were 30  active transmission connections between the U.S. and Canada,  trading about $3 billion worth of electricity in 2014. ', '  The exchange of electricity with Mexico is less developed though  it started back in 1905, when privately owned utilities in remote  areas struck cross-border deals to share power over low voltage  lines. ', '  In 2015, the U.S. government granted Blackstone Group permission  to export electricity from the Frontera power plant in the Rio  Grande Valley to Mexico’s newly opened electricity market this  year. Mexican customers pay nearly twice as much as U.S.  customers do for the power.', '  “Mexico is building some renewable projects along the border and  that power is going to the U.S.,” said Alex Wood, DOE policy  analyst, in a recent interview. ', '  “It really is becoming more and more integrated,” said Wood of  the North American market. “Virtually all of Canada’s surplus oil  goes to the United States. The United States is producing surplus  crude oil. … It’s refined and it goes to Mexico.”', '  Wood added that Sempra’s Energia Sierra Juarez wind farm in  Mexico provides power to southern California.']"

We could purchase  multiple parcels under that size if they didn’t adjoin and  didn’t run afoul of other rules.  ', 'We switched gears and locales. We’d spotted a house on the  South Island’s east coast that looked good online. In person, it  wasn’t great. Discouraged again, Richard decided to focus  on small plots of land with house-building  potential. ', 'He found a real estate agent who had farmed the area. This  agent suggested the Palmerston parcel just up the road. The owner  had carved pieces off his property to create “lifestyle blocks.″  The remaining two were under the 5-hectare ceiling, but next to  each other. We ruled out buying both because of  the adjoining-parcel restriction. Richard  opted for the marginally larger one. “It’s a start,” I  said when he phoned. “Go for it.”', '  We agreed to tackle the bach later. This would give us time to  research contractors and landscapers and work with our local  governing body, the Waitaki District Council. It issues building  and other permits, performs inspections, and regulates zoning and  usage.

The drawback — the not-so-tiny  price of $215,000 and up, plus tax. Then again, we could  always park a camper on the site, our lawyer confirmed. A tent  might also suffice.', '  New Zealand property deals move quickly once you learn the ropes.  I arrived on Nov. 6, in time to tour the 10 acres and review the  paperwork. The map revealed a narrow strip between our parcel and  the second, 10-acre one. We discovered the owner had kept this  buffer land for a potential right of way; it wasn’t part of  either block. Since the lots didn’t adjoin, we could buy both,  our lawyer said. We signed for the first, then bid on the  second.

65,Bob Iger tells us about Disney’s $5.5 billion bet on China,2016-06-09T15:10:16+0000,"['Walt Disney opened its first Disneyland in mainland China Wednesday, with the  theme park being described as “authentically Disney and  distinctly Chinese.” ', 'CEO Bob Iger spoke with CNBC’s Eunice Yoon about the event, which Iger called the “biggest step” the company  has taken in an overseas market. Read the full exchange  below.', ' CNBC: Why is the park so important for  Disney’s ambitions in China? Iger: Well, China represents a great market  for the Walt Disney because our stories are not only known  here but they are universal in appeal, they touch people’s hearts  all over the world, no matter what country, no matter what  culture. So this is, I think, a great market for Disney and a  growth market as well. Obviously the size of the market, the  number of people, is another reason, but , and this is an  extremely [big] step —or the biggest step, actually —  that we’ve ever taken anywhere to grow in a market. ', ' CNBC: What is the next step for Disney in  this market? Iger: Well, I don’t know that there is a next  step; there are a number of steps. We continue to grow our motion  picture business. So far, most of that has been exporting films  that we make in other parts of the world into China; that’s  delivered great growth. China is now the No. 2 movie market in  the world. We also plan to make Disney movies here; we’ve  actually started that process. With the strength of the Disney  brand and the knowledge of Disney characters, there’s a growing  retail business here. And, in part because of digital technology  but in part just because of the growth of the market, there are  all sorts of opportunities in television, although there we  continue to face regulation that makes it a little more  difficult. ', ' CNBC: So, how does this park help with the  other parts of the business in this market?  Iger: Well, it clearly will serve as sort  of a booster rocket for people’s appreciation of Disney, the  knowledge that Disney is universal in appeal to people,  appreciation and knowledge of characters and stories. An  immersive park experience the Disney way is something that people  will remember for the rest of their lives, and that goes a long  way in terms of not just creating word of mouth, but in terms of  creating people’s interest in passion for our brand and  everything that it stands for and everything that bears its name,  as a for instance. So it becomes very, very important, not just  in terms of awareness but appreciation.', 'CNBC: How are Chinese consumers different from others?Iger: Well, in many respects as it relates to Disney, they’re not  different at all. In fact, they’ve confirmed to us what our  founder Walt Disney believed all the way back in his day, and  that is that our stories are designed not just for one age group  —children or parents or grandparents—not just one  nationality, not just for one religion, nor generation; they’re  designed for everybody, and he was right. And because of that,  the consumer we’re seeing now is really behaving as it relates to  interest in Disney the same way consumers behave when interest in  Disney is ignited all over the world.', ' CNBC: What are you doing in this park then,  differently for the Chinese, compared to other parks? Iger: Well, that’s something that is extremely important  to us and does differentiate this from all other parks. We  believe that in entering China we needed to bring a park to China  that very much felt like China’s Disneyland and not just,  Disneyland in China. We wanted to do that because we thought  showing a respect and appreciation for the culture here would be  very important, and we also wanted people to have a sense of  pride and ownership toward this park, feeling that this park was  their park. And there was only one way to do that. We knew we had  to be authentically Disney because that is what Disneyland is and  what was desired, but we also knew we had to be distinctly  Chinese and that because the design and construction mandate from  the very beginning, let’s build something that is authentically  Disney, distinctly Chinese, and that is evidenced throughout this  park in many, many different ways.  ', ' CNBC: So, how did you tailor this park for the  Chinese? Iger: Well, many ways. To begin with, we eliminated Main  Street. Main Street exists in our five other locations around the  world. It was the inspiration of Walt Disney; it was inspired by  the town in the Midwest United States that he grew up in,  Marceline. I felt strongly that bringing Main Street Marceline,  or Main Street USA, to China, wouldn’t necessarily feel relevant,  wouldn’t be of that much interest … kind of nice, but we  thought we could do something better. And so, we eliminated that  but we turned the entry sequence of sorts into Mickey Avenue, so,  it’s more based on Disney than on any one place in the world for  instance. All the iconography. Obviously [offering] Mandarin  first very, very important, save for a few places. Even our  storytelling here started in Mandarin and was translated to  English so that we could rework it and understand it instead of  the other way around, starting in English and then translating  into Mandarin. That way it’s much more authentic in terms of the  language, and the storytelling [is so] much more distinctive in  that sense, to use those words. The food was obvious, about 70  percent of the food here is Chinese in nature. ', '  Also, the entertainment, there’s a lot of entertainment in this  park; there are about 1,000 Chinese performers from all over  China. But the people behind the scenes, directors and costume  designers, the director of the ‘Tarzan’ show, who envisioned the  storytelling of Tarzan to be in Chinese acrobatic form with  Chinese performers, for instance, distinctly Chinese…. The  architecture, putting a Chinese teahouse right in the center of  this park in grand form, the Teahouse of the Wandering Moon.  Disneytown using architecture that is sort of old Shanghai  architecture, and people see it, and ‘Ah, I recognize that,’ I  like that. So, there’s a tremendous amount here that is very  distinctly Chinese, and we’re not expecting people to come in and  say, ‘That’s very Chinese.’ We’re expecting people to leave with  a sense that they experienced something that was very much Disney  but very much felt like theirs, very much felt like home. ', ' CNBC: Do you find that Chinese visitors spend time  differently in the parks? And, if so, how do you make sure that  you’re accommodating them properly? Iger: Well, this is all still very new. We’ve had  over half a million people come through this park and over a  million people actually visit the overall property, so, reaching  firm conclusions at this point would be premature. We’ve  certainly learned a lot already. Interesting, one thing that we  anticipated and it was reflected in the design, if you look at  China today, especially its most urban parts, there aren’t many  places that people can go to get shade, to relax, to be in what I  will call a bucolic setting. So, the design of Gardens of  Imagination, which is this seven-acre garden that sits in front  of the castle, serves as our hub but has water features, and is  tree lined and had plants and is generally a great place to sit  and relax. [It] was very much the results of research that we  did, where we believe that we were actually answering a need that  people had. The lake that we built, Wishing Star Lake, was  another example of that: let’s build a beautiful place that  people can walk around and sit and enjoy. As a for instance, we  actually have property within the confines of the theme park  itself that’s just grassy stretches for people to sit out on a  nice sunny day and sit on grass, and I noticed the other day  people throwing Frisbees around and people sitting and having  lunch. So they clearly are enjoying that. In terms of other forms  of behavior they are getting used to we’re offering, which is  Disney, a lot of people in one place, generally having a good  time, but it’s a different, unique experience for people. We’re  learning how they’re learning from us.', ' CNBC: We’ve already seen evidence there that the  economic slowdown has effected consumer behavior and the consumer  market, is this something that you’re worried about at  all?  Iger: No, because we’re building something to last  forever and when we make a decision to invest at this level we  don’t pin that decision on one time economically, we think long  term about a market; we really take a long view. So, whether it’s  here or in other parts of the world, current or near-term  economic circumstances or political circumstances or whatever  typically don’t cause much anxiety with us.', ' CNBC: Does it affect your pricing at all? Iger:  Our approach to pricing in this  marketplace took into [account] a number of circumstances and  conditions; none were really specifically tied what’s going on in  the economy today, but they took into account the overall Chinese  economy, the Chinese consumer, spendable income, price-to-value  relationship, the fact that we were building something [of that]  scale, something that was very high in quality, something that  was unique, something that many people aspire to, having heard  about, read about Disneyland and that experience. So, it was all,  a lot of things factored into the decision. ', ' CNBC: Who do you think your target Chinese consumer  is.. is there one?  Iger: The great new [approach] about Disney is everyone is  our target consumer. What I’ve loved [about] actually about  watching people enjoy this park the last few weeks is the  multigenerations that come together. We assumed that would be the  case, but the number of groups that include grandparents and  parents and a grandchild is just extraordinary to me. We thought  that would be the case, but it’s very evident here when you walk  around on a full day. It’s for everyone. I’ve seen single people.  You go at night, it’s very different; they don’t have kids, in  some cases they’re not married, people on dates. That’s always  nice to see. I’ve seen grandparents alone; I’ve seen parents with  kids; I’ve seen mothers with their children. It’s sort of, again,  the great thing about Disney, that universal appeal, and  certainly that’s true with this park.', ' CNBC:  Some of your Chinese competitors have  been saying negative things about you guys and saying that Disney  won’t necessarily having a long-term future here. Where do you  see Disney fitting into the overall theme park  industry?  Iger: Well, I think the theme park industry in China  is growing and will continue to grow. We were aware that there  was significant competition when we entered this market; we fully  anticipated there would be more competition. What we knew and  what we would concluded and what we already know to be the case  is we’re bringing a product that is unlike any other in this  market. Obviously, it starts with the fact that it’s Disney, and  with that comes Disney stories, characters and our intellectual  property. In addition to that, the level of the investment here  basically creates something that is unique in terms of quality.  In order to build something that is this great, all of the  detail, all of the beautiful artwork, all of the great  attractions, the technology that we put into the experience that  takes significant investment and our competitors don’t come close  in terms of either being able to or wanting to put that kind of  investment into their parks. In addition, we have 60 years of  operating experience. That’s a lot of experience; we do this  really well. And we’ve learned along the way, that’s only enabled  us to get better. No one comes close to that. The quality of the  experience that you get here, whether it’s what you’re eating,  what you’re riding, what show you’re seeing, how you’re being  treated by the person who’s taking your ticket, the person that’s  serving your meal, the person that’s making sure you’re in your  seat and ready for the ride to start, is vastly different than  what anyone else has to offer. So, to those that are criticizing  us, they clearly do not know our product, or they suffer from  significant envy for that product, and frankly, what they’ve said  is completely immaterial to us. ', ' CNBC: So, you wouldn’t say, when they say, ‘Oh, the  pricing is too high or you guys don’t understand China very  well,’ what do you….? Iger: The pricing of this park reflects the quality  of what we have built and the experience that we deliver. The  pricing of the parks of those that are criticizing us are  offering reflects exactly what they’re offering to their  people. ', ' CNBC: Switching gears a bit, I wanted to ask you a little  bit more about the American business community because there’s  been a feeling among the American business community that the  working environment here has become more anti-foreign. Is this  something that you’re experiencing as well or is it something  that enters your mind when you’re planning for the future?    Iger: China has always presented a number of  challenges to global business from a variety of directions, for a  variety of reasons, none that I really want to get into very  much. We’re well aware of what those challenges are and what they  have been, and yet, we continue to march forward and develop this  property and ultimately build it. I think the fact that we have  built this, that we have great Chinese partners, that we have the  approval of the government to do this, suggests that this is a  market that, while there have been challenges, that we’ve been  able to enter, I think, quite successfully. And clearly we’re  appreciative of the kind of support that we received and was  necessary from the government in order to do this. ', ' CNBC: How do you know that you have that high level  support within the government?  Iger: Well I’ve been working on this for 17 years,  and I’ve engaged with three presidents and a few premiers and a  number of vice-premiers and a number of party secretaries and  five or six mayors of Shanghai. And I know from the engagement  that I’ve had with numerous people over time, including President  Xi Jinping, that they are very supportive of what we are doing  here and what we have done here. This is, I think, a big shining  example of the fact that an American company or any kind of  global company can do something on a really grand scale here in  China. ', ' CNBC: Have any of them ever visited your  parks?  Iger: President Xi has been to a few of our parks,  yes. Actually, I think, to my knowledge, all those who I  referenced, even though I didn’t mention names, have visited  various parks at various times. ', ' CNBC: And what do they say their reactions are,  especially President Xi? Iger: Well, President Xi had said that he had visited  Tokyo and California and Orlando, and I think that’s one of the  reasons why he was supportive of us doing [this]. He must have  had a good experience. He didn’t tell me specifically that he  did, but I think [it] played a part in the approval of this.', ' CNBC: One other issue that a lot American companies  have is, of course, intellectual property rights violations. What  are you doing to contend with those issues, as well as  others? Iger: Well, I’ve always believed that the best way  you combat intellectual property theft is making a product  available that is well priced, well timed to market, whether it’s  movie product, TV product, music product, even theme-park  product. So, we’ll continue to do that. That said, we do need  regulatory help and support to do that. We’ve actually gotten  more of that in China; they’ve actually singled Disney  intellectual property out as something is to be protected, and  I’m fairly trusting that this government is going to continue to  do more and do the right thing as it relates to intellectual  property. Now, this is a good example, we have partners that are  local here that will suffer with us if the product that we  showcase here at our theme park is stolen by others. So, having a  local partner that is as invested, that may consider themselves  vulnerable to intellectual property theft, I think will go a long  way.  ', ' CNBC: What’s next for the theme-park business, Disney  Mumbai?  (laughing)   Iger: A lot of people have asked us about India.  Great country, land of many colors and many flavors, as I’ve  said. Rich country in terms of their culture. Certainly a lot of  people. Not developing a theme park there right now. ', '  [Shanghai] has been the priority of ours for quite a long time;  we’re incredibly excited about what we’re about to show the  world. We’re going to make sure that this is right, that it’s  operationally smooth and we obviously have great expansion  opportunities here in Shanghai. We’ll certainly take those very  seriously. We’re also expanding in Hong Kong and expanding in  Orlando and expanding in Tokyo and expanding in Anaheim, building  new cruise ships. So, there’s a lot going on at this company in  terms of expansion.', ' CNBC: What would tell Chinese consumers that say, ‘Oh  there’s already a Hong Kong park, I don’t necessarily need to go  to Shanghai’? Iger: Well, there’s a great Hong Kong park; I’d love  them to go to Hong Kong as well. They should go there because  it’s different, it’s very different and it’s great. We hope, by  the way, that people who have visited Hong Kong become interested  in visiting Shanghai because their interest has in some form or  another has been triggered by or been heightened by visiting Hong  Kong and vice versa. What’s great about this park is about 70  percent of it is original and so you can go here and you can go  to Hong Kong and have a completely different experience and vice  versa. And this is a big enough market, we have been asked this  before about two parks in one country; by the way, we’ve had two  in the United States for well over 40 years. China’s certainly  big enough to sustain more than one park — geographically,  number of people, affordability and tourism is rising as well to  China — and that’s obviously going to help. ', ' CNBC: You mentioned the movie business. Last year,  you guys had a monstrous successful year; your year was just  massive. Do you think that you’ll be able to repeat that again in  2016? Iger: Yes, 2016 — so far, so good. Off to a  great start, probably will be our most successful year ever,  given the fact that we’ve launched three fantastic movies in  ‘Zootopia,’ ‘Jungle Book’ and ‘Captain America Civil War.’  ‘Zootopia’ and ‘Captain America Civil War’ are already over a  billion dollars in global box office, ‘Jungle Book’ near it.  Great movies to come, ‘Finding Dory’ coming out in a couple of  weeks, for instance, and lots more to come this year . So, it’s  been a great year already for our company on the movie side, and  what we have coming up is going to be great, too.', ' CNBC: How do plan to turn things around for ESPN and  the cable business?  Iger: I’m here in Shanghai at Disneyland and while all of our  businesses are always on my mind, I’ve kind of put everything  else on my agenda off to the side temporarily so that we could  focus on this.']"

The USDA projects China will import 121m tonnes of soyabeans in a decade, up more than 30 per cent from today.', '* * *', 'In 1989, when Shanghai’s first branch of Kentucky Fried Chicken opened in a former British gentleman’s club on the Bund riverfront, the average person in China ate about 20kg of meat a year. After almost three decades of income gains, annual per-capita meat consumption has surpassed 50kg.', 'KFC now operates 5,000 outlets in China and will add hundreds more this year. The Bund restaurant has moved to a less glitzy spot, but not a single seat was empty as diners tucked into chicken burgers, wraps and wings on a recent afternoon. “Everything sells well here,” says stripe-shirted waiter Wang Shuai.', 'Bolstering the trend is an urban population that rises by roughly 20m a year, faster than China’s overall growth rate, as city residents tend to eat  more meat.', '“We eat meat every day. It’s almost become too much,” says Ahmat Barat, a 41-year old taxi driver in Urumqi, the capital of China’s northwestern Xinjiang region. “When I was young, we didn’t have a fridge at home and we would only eat meat once or twice a week.”', 'To satisfy this appetite, Chinese animal agriculture has emerged from small “backyard” operations feeding food scraps to pigs to industrial businesses. Agriculture ministry data cited by US diplomats show that large-scale poultry farms grew from two-thirds to more than 90 per cent of China’s total and large-scale swine farms went from 16 per cent to an estimated 50 per cent between 2005 and 2015. Cargill, for instance, built a $360m poultry farm in Anhui province able to process 65m chickens per year.', 'The companies springing up to nourish the animals created fortunes for domestic tycoons: Bao Hongxing, chief executive of China’s largest pig-feed producer Twins Group, is worth an estimated $1.8bn. Reflecting the surging sales, Dalian Commodity Exchange soya meal is now the world’s most heavily traded agricultural futures contract.', 'China may be the ancestral home of the soyabean, but its harvests rarely nudge above 15m tonnes. The domestic crop costs more to produce than imports, so demand is mainly sustained by a ban on the use of genetically modified crops in everyday foodstuffs.', 'No such restriction applies to soya used in animal feed and cooking oil, so they now largely come from foreign crops with bioengineered traits such as pesticide resistance. Chinese leaders opened the door to soyabean imports even as they clung to a policy of self-sufficiency in staple food grains.', 'In response, companies are building an increasingly elaborate international soyabean conveyor belt. Cargill, along with China’s New Hope Group and another local partner, in April opened a $100m soyabean crushing plant in a port city near Beijing. Across the Pacific, United Grain recently spent $80m to move more soyabeans and corn through its wheat export terminal on the Columbia river in Washington state.', '“We ship five vessels per month of just soyabeans,” which “typically go to China”, says Brentt Roberts of United Grain, a unit of Mitsui of Japan.', 'A thousand miles east, in Lansford, North Dakota, the CHS SunPrairie grain co-operative that Mr Moberg chairs is building a railway loop that will allow trains to load the local harvest without stopping and slingshot back to the Pacific coast. “I just know a lot of them get on a boat and head to China,” says Mr Moberg, his jeans muddy from planting.', 'US farmers are well aware of the importance of the China trade.

While the Amazon has been spared further deforestation by a 2006 industry-government “soy moratorium”, the pact doesn’t cover the cerrado.', 'Environmental campaigners have been pushing Brazil to widen the moratorium to the cerrado and pressuring international traders such as Bunge and Cargill to commit not to buy soya from farms on recently cleared land.', 'Glenn Hurowitz of Mighty, an environmental group, says that while cattle, paper and palm oil are forces of deforestation, “we see an immediate opportunity to dramatically reduce deforestation for soy because of the international nature of the soy market”.', 'Bunge and Cargill have backed the moratorium and pledged to eliminate deforestation from their supply chains. But they say the cerrado ecosystem is different from the Amazon.

69,Harold Hamm: Natural gas from the USA is going to have a ‘world impact’,2017-06-12T15:09:28+0000,"['The price of oil keeps sliding as an abundance of supply keeps a ceiling on the price — despite the rising tensions in the Middle East — and  is sharply lower over the last 30 days well.', 'In a phone interview with CNBC, Harold Hamm, chairman and CEO of Continental Resources, talked about turmoil between Qatar and its neighbors, the price of liquid natural gas and oil, and the latest on the United States’ first LNG exports to Northern and Central Europe.', 'CNBC: Last Thursday, the White House announced LNG shipments to the Netherlands and Poland — the first American LNG exports into northern and central Europe. You have said in the past that U.S. exports of natural gas to Europe would shake up the geopolitical landscape, because it would relieve Europe from being beholden to Russian natural gas.  Hamm: Yes. The world impact news you are talking about is a huge thing, because Poland has been subservient to Russia, because Russia could hold things over Poland’s head to get what they want. Now it won’t be possible. These exports are also a part of the larger picture of U.S. energy independence. We are now past the point of the U.S. being energy-independent with natural gas. We are shipping around the world, and now with infrastructure being built and put into place, we will continue to export even more through time. This is just the beginning.', 'CNBC: Let’s turn to regulations. LNG facilities needs permits.  Hamm: Yes, and it does not make sense! Why do we need a special permit for LNG? You don’t need a permit for gasoline or oil. To unleash LNG’s potential, we can’t have this permit slowdown! Our company is bullish on natural gas, and this permitting process is putting LNG exploration and production on the sidelines. There is no reason why LNG can’t be exported like crude oil.', 'I have had talks with Secretary Rick Perry at the Department of Energy, and the length of time it takes to get permits approved is one of the things he said he will get fixed. There is no reason to have this long permitting delay. Government just needs to go down the boxes and check them, make sure safety measures are in place, and permits should be given. Some of the first permits for LNG facilities took five years to pass. Some permits took seven years! The Obama administration held them up. That certainly needs to be remedied. We have the cleanest fuel in the world, and yet it is being delayed to the consumer. It can offset the pollution of coal, wood.  CNBC: How does this change the landscape of energy exports and what does this mean for Qatar, which is the world’s largest exporter of natural gas?  Hamm: The Qatar situation certainly brings up the delicate situations that are involved in doing business over there in the Middle East Region. All those tribal factions in Qatar are now coming into play. The fact Iran has been so involved with them is what has brought this about. But this conflict provides opportunity for the United States in exporting our natural gas. We are a neutral nation. Other countries like China or other Qatar customers would not have to worry about anything if they wanted to import U.S. LNG.', 'CNBC: The U.S. is in the early innings of LNG exports. The first shipment of U.S. LNG from the lower 48 states left in February 2016. As infrastructure continues to be built out, what kind of LNG export capacity will we be expecting?  Hamm: It does takes time to build out. With the proposed facilities to be built and facilities already permitted, you can be looking at 11 billion cubic feet a day in the next two years.  CNBC: Where do you see nat gas prices going?  Hamm: We are in for very moderate pricing for nat gas for a lot of years going forward. I feel prices are in a fair range. I think we will be north of the average $3.50 by the end of the year. In 2018, I expect the same. Who knows about where prices go after that? I think we have adequate supply for a hundred years. I think north of three dollars may be the new normal. With the quantities of gas that we produce it would give us a good rate of return at Continental from the plays in which we are involved.', 'CNBC: Oil prices have tumbled to their lowest levels this year amid those tensions between Qatar and its neighbors — Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. Do you see a ceiling on oil prices at this moment?  Hamm: I don’t think we speculate on where it will go. Look what has happened to the market. OPEC decided to flood the market in 2014 and it was a big mistake. OPEC saw shale as a threat and tried to quash it. They failed. It was not the wisest thing they did. They now realize it was a mistake. Last time they killed the market was in the 1980′s and it took a while to turn things around. They decided in January to cut back production. But you have to remember, you need more than 120 days to turn around the impact of the cuts. We are now more than 120 days in, and we are seeing fundamentals changing. Inventories are on a downward trend, but sporadic week to week.', 'CNBC: You said last month in your May 9 shareholder meeting that you saw about a 1 million barrels per day draw-down on oil inventories. How long do you see this playing out to get rid of this overhang in supplies?   Hamm: The biggest challenge is 60 percent of refineries don’t participate in announcing inventories. Only 40 percent participate. It’s an inaccurate mechanism from the start. One week versus another, there’s going to be a huge variance. Two inventories that everyone looks at are API (American Petroleum Institute) and EIA (U.S. Energy Information Administration), and those two last week showed a 2-million barrel difference (between one another). They don’t even jibe. The fact is, this is a choppy situation, but I believe fundamentals are in place. Demand is slightly outpacing supply. Ultimately the production cuts take effect.  CNBC: The EIA is predicting U.S. oil production could rise to a new high record of around 10 million barrels a day. At the pace U.S. shale production is going, when do you see that record being shattered?  Hamm: It all depends on price. Continental has been disciplined. Operators across the U.S. have been also. Across the U.S., fields have not been turned on. Seventy-five percent of rigs have been laid down in the industry. Entire fields have gone undrilled, waiting on better product prices. Four hundred thousand people were laid off in the industry, so it’s going to take a while to get them back. Every operator has a lot of levers to pull and options. It all depends on price.']"

73,How China is changing your dinner plate,2015-10-21T12:07:13+0000,"['California is a massive, food-making machine. The state is the  nation’s largest agricultural producer and exporter. It grows  more than a third of the country’s vegetables, two-thirds of the  nation’s fruits and nuts. Tulare County, in the middle of the  Central Valley, is America’s top dairy producing region.', '  But deep into year four of the drought, many California farmers  have been leveled. The hardship is palpable. Fallowed or idled  land forms brown blocks of dry dirt, littered with brittle  branches, alongside patches of bright green, the watered crops  doted on like a better-loved sibling. With water bills soaring  some tenfold, farmers are making choices about what lives and  what dies.', 'In an increasingly export driven market, California farmers are proving quite adaptable. And more of their decisions hinge on China and the growing role  it’s playing in shaping agriculture, water and food production in  the American West.', '  “The overseas market is extremely important,” says Jesus Ramos, a  farmer who owns 140 acres of mostly citrus trees in Terra Bella  in Tulare County. “That dictates whether you can keep a crop  going or not.”', '  Chinese housewives with more income covet select, imported U.S.  food, but halfway around the world, back in California, some of  the state’s roughly 78,000 farms and ranches are producing more agricultural  products that can require a lot of water to produce, scarce  California water. There’s frustration about how the U.S. is  exporting water through agricultural products to China.', 'Farmers are discerning  about which crops and varieties to water, and which ones to  fallow. Take a crop like oranges. Beyond heft, the sweetest  varieties are preferred, and seedless is better than seeds.  Consumers are picky about food. They hover over mountains of  stacked oranges in search of produce perfection. ', '  Born in Mexico, Ramos came to America as a young crew picker.  During harvest, the work pace is furious. Pickers scurry up  ladders with palm-sized clippers to cut oranges off stems. Nearly  all oranges in the world are cut by hand this way. Snip, snip,  snip. A landowner and grandfather now, Ramos fully grasps the  gamble that is farming. “You can lose your life savings in just a  couple of years.”', '  Walking around one of his six ranches in August, blocks of citrus  trees behind him, Ramos’ young picking days seem simple compared  to the global demands of modern farming. The water bill for one  10-acre ranch, for example, jumped to $33,000 in 2014 from  $3,200 in 2013. His total water bill for all his ranches has  soared to more than $200,000, compared to roughly $17,000 just a  few years ago. Beyond managing water costs, an export-focused  citrus crop can trigger food production changes mandated by  overseas markets. China, for example, requires controlling and  documenting the Fuller rose beetle as a condition of receiving  imports there. While not a major threat, the beetle is common in  Tulare County citrus.', 'Pest control? Check. Water costs? Check, check. Then Ramos  worries about how his perfect round orbs of fruit will travel on  shipping containers to key Asian markets, including South Korea  and China. Skins that peel easily are preferred, but not so thin  they’ll get bruised and crushed during the weekslong  transportation journey. “I prioritize firmer fruits that can  withstand the shipping time,” Ramos explained.', 'As if farming wasn’t enough of a juggling act, producers of  commodities ranging from citrus to almonds are wary of  China’s slowing economy, the world’s second largest. There’s worry  the downturn could hurt demand for California’s food bounty. “All  of the sudden, you have to be concerned your fruit may not move  in Asia,” said Ramos.', '  He has fallowed some of his Tulare County land, and put 25 acres  up for sale in 2014 amid scarce water. No buyers yet. “If you  drive around, you’ll notice a lot of ‘for sale’ signs,” he said.', '  Sandwiched between San Francisco and Los Angeles, the great  Central Valley is roughly 450 miles long and 40 to 60 miles wide.  From Interstate 5, head inland onto state Route 99. Neat crop  aisles whip past you. Roll down the window to the tangy odor of  manure and, sometimes, the sweet fragrance of citrus tree flowers in  bloom. If you peel off 99 and slow down at dusk, listen for the  rustle of olive and almond tree branches against the faint wind.  It’s here in the arid, rolling hills of the Central Valley that  Ramos is fighting to maintain his land with little water.', '  Rain always in the back of his mind, he keeps busy farming. He  tidies his property down to wrenches, hung on nails and arranged  by size like small soldiers. He drives down each citrus aisle in  one of several utility vehicles — all with names including a  green one called “Moco,” Spanish for snot or booger. “You have to  have a sense of humor about these things.”', '  By humor, Ramos also means doing the best you can during dry and  wet years. The state’s agriculture complex pushed back against  surface water shortages by pumping more groundwater, or liquid  tucked underneath the earth’s surface.', '  And in this vortex of water allotments and politics, perhaps no  agricultural products expose the collision of rising China demand  and U.S. food production quite like hay, dairy products and  almonds. Crop reports and export data show these select  commodities making big export gains as they’re desired by China’s  growing middle class.', '“There are likely many smaller commodities that will get a  similar boost of demand from China,” said Ryland Maltsbarger, an  agricultural economist at IHS. “China will remain a significant  influencer on the global food system.”', '  As China’s incomes expand and appetites shift to embrace more  foreign food, smaller farms like Ramos’ are getting on with the  business of farming. Previous drought years have flattened cash-flow cushions. Many farmers are in their 50s and older. They’ve  drained retirement accounts and savings for children to pay for  water. This winter, they’re praying for El Niño, a  naturally occurring weather pattern that can bring heavy  precipitation. With federal forecasters calling for a greater  than 90 percent chance that El Niño will last all winter for  the Northern Hemisphere, farmers and ranchers are placing one  more bet on rain-soaked land. The outcome could impact what’s on  our dinner plates for years to come.', '  Daniel Putnam has been a plant and soil scientist for some 30  years. Now at the University of California, Davis, he researches  how to boost land productivity, or raise more food on the same  amount of soil. As the drought has lingered, he’s been getting  some phone calls about one particular water-thirsty crop:  alfalfa hay, used to feed livestock including cows to produce  milk products. In the vast basket of agricultural crops,  high-margin almonds are the hot girls at the party. Pistachios,  walnuts, easy-to-peel tangelos are way popular. But alfalfa? Hay  is hay — unless you throw China into the mix.', '  While exporting U.S. hay is not new, shipments to Asia and the  Middle East have climbed in recent years, according to USDA data.  Japan imports a lot of U.S. hay, but shipments to China have  vaulted from near zero in the mid-2000s to roughly 1 million  metric tons as forecasted for 2015, according to UC Davis and  industry estimates. While China’s appetite for exported hay from  Western states is growing, the commodity’s biggest market remains  domestic dairies, as well as feed for horses, beef and  sheep.', '  Despite China’s vast landmass, plants and vegetation on land for  grazing animals is relatively scarce. And with China’s growing  appetite for protein — including dairy products — more  Chinese farmers are importing hay — particularly from Western  U.S. states. While exporting U.S. hay is not new, shipments to  Asia and the Middle East have climbed in recent years, according  to USDA data.', 'The rub for some water experts is U.S. hay producers’ shipping of water-intensive hay halfway around the world on shipping  containers — in the middle of a drought. “When I found out  we were shipping bales of hay across the world, you could have  knocked me over with a feather,” said Robert Glennon, a water  resource expert at the University of Arizona. “And I’m a water  guy,” said Glennon, also author of “Unquenchable.” ', 'He estimates 2 million tons of Western alfalfa hay, which required 100 billion gallons of water to produce, was  shipped overseas, including to Asia, in 2014. Glennon’s larger  point is the need for a coherent, domestic agricultural policy  that treats water as a precious resource.', '  The hay market’s peculiarities also raise larger questions about  the value of exporting more agricultural products in a global  economy. California and the U.S. agriculture complex feed the  world. But there’s a finite amount of arable land and limited  water supplies. And the planet will only get more crowded. The  world’s population will reach 9.7 billion by 2050, up from the  current 7.3 billion, according to United Nations figures. Who’s going to produce the food to feed the world? The California  drought will end, eventually. And it will rain again. But  researchers wonder what happens during the next round, when the  planet is more populated and hotter?', '  Piling on to the moral question about exporting “virtual” water,  the staggering U.S.-China trade imbalance incentivizes American  producers to take advantage of shipping container “empties” that  might otherwise return to Asia unfilled. Shipping goods such as hay  from California’s Imperial Valley, east of San Diego, to Tulare  County in the Central Valley can run $60 to $70 a ton, estimates  Putnam of UC Davis. Transporting the same batch of goods from  Long Beach, California, to a port in Asia is a relative bargain  at roughly $25 to $45 a ton. Turns out you can make money  shipping something — even hay and recycled cardboard —  to China on an “empty.” ', '  Shipping hay to China makes some people uncomfortable because it  illustrates how America’s economy is shaped by domestic producers  that export raw materials, which China converts into finished  goods. Cotton for jeans, lumber for furniture. So instead of just  exporting commodities, some American farmers have figured out how  to keep hay on U.S. soil and produce finished milk products  domestically for export to international markets.', 'With roots stretching to Denmark, fourth-generation dairyman Pete Olsen and his two brothers farm 1,700 acres of  alfalfa, corn and rye at Hillside Dairy in Fallon in western  Nevada. In between milking cows and managing the dairy, Olsen has  traveled the world — including to China — and probably  knows more than most about food production in a growing export  economy.', '  In September 2014, Olsen, regional farmers and local economic  developers did something you don’t hear about every day. The  group opened an $85 million dairy manufacturing plant on U.S.  soil. The facility encompasses the whole supply chain —  local hay feed for cows to the final end product of dry milk  powder, sifted into bags for export to overseas markets, including  China.', 'The plant was designed by the Dairy Farmers of America, which  includes more than 14,000 dairy producers. It processes 1.5  million pounds of raw milk daily into 250,000 pounds of whole  milk powder that’s shipped to consumers globally. Regional  farmers sell their crops, including alfalfa hay and milk to the  plant, with the end product bound for the port of Oakland,  California, and then store shelves around the world. “For us as  dairymen, the plant provides long-term stability,” Olsen said.  “You know you’re going to have someone to sell to.” And that  “someone” includes China.', 'Chinese moms and housewives have long sought dry milk powder  because it’s a protein-rich food that boasts a long shelf life. The percentage of U.S. dairy goods exported to China has  climbed to roughly 15 percent from around 5 percent since 2008,  when tainted baby formula lead to several infant deaths and  thousands of sick babies. Chinese milk products were found to  contain melamine, a chemical used to manufacture plastics and  fertilizer that can cause kidney stones and kidney failure. When  added to agricultural products, the chemical can indicate higher  protein content.', '  Back in America, dairy producers noticed rising global demand for  safe, “Made in USA” milk products and boosted production for  overseas markets. U.S. dairy farmers joined other big,  international exporters including New Zealand. In the past  decade, U.S. dairy export value to China has soared to $692.6  million in 2014 from $59.2 million in 2004, according to USDA  data. The massive gains reflect the 2008 melamine scare and  rising Chinese demand for dairy. But China’s broader economy is  retreating to slower growth, and milk imports there have shifted  into lower gear. In the first half of 2015, China’s dairy imports  as measured in the equivalent of milk were down 35 percent from  last year, according to analysis from the U.S. Dairy Export  Council.', 'Despite China’s recent downturn, milk imports in China will  remain significant over the long haul. Growing hay for feed is  difficult in China. Unlike America, China’s farming complex is a patchwork of microfarms — a few acres down to mini  scattered plots — that makes scalable food production  challenging.', 'That’s good news for the 45-employee Nevada plant that was  designed to make dairy products to the specifications of  international customers including a preference for whole milk  powder. As more agricultural products are manufactured and  tailored for export — especially to China and other rapidly  developing nations — producers are building global market  share and moving up the food chain, literally. “The local milk  supply is a big deal for our global customers who want to know  where their dairy products come from,” Olsen said. “In China,  they want to know it came off the shelf in the United States.”', '  China and the world loves California almonds. The state’s almond  cash receipts surged for the fourth consecutive year in the 2013  crop year, as revenue rose to $5.77 billion, according to USDA  figures. Though everyone from corporate farms to crew  pickers is feeling the pinch of parched weather, almond farmers  comparatively are hurting less. And despite the almond industry’s  improved irrigation practices, the water-intensive crop has  become a target for scrutiny.', '  “We are a very visible industry in California that has grown  dramatically over the last 20 years,” said third-generation  farmer Tom Rogers. He owns a 175-acre almond farm in Madera,  California, northwest of Fresno, and produces some 2,500 pounds of  almonds per acre.', '  Next year will mark the farm’s 100th year in operation since  Rogers’ grandparents immigrated from Italy. Up until the late  ’70s, the Rogers family had grown cotton, alfalfa hay, corn and  raised some cattle. But Rogers’ late father had a hunch about  almonds — long before consumers began reaching for snacking  almonds, almond milk, almond butter and a broad variety of  plant-based proteins. “He was willing to look out and try  different things,” said Rogers.', '  His water bill for his almond farm has soared 50 to 100 percent  during the drought, as he’s pumped more groundwater to irrigate  crops. Groundwater flows naturally to the top, or can be pumped  up through wells. For the past two years, Rogers has received no  surface water supplies found in rivers, lakes and reservoirs, and has relied purely on groundwater.', 'This is not a sustainable business model for any farmer or  rancher. A few years ago, his annual surface water costs ranged  from $25,000 to $30,000. More recently he paid around $150,000 in  well repairs alone. And that first patch of almonds his father  planted in 1979? Rogers fallowed the older field in November last  year, as the older trees were producing less crop.', '  If you linger in an agricultural county, you’ll find folks old  enough to recall when farmers began pulling up apple trees to  make room for fancier crops in the Central Valley. The bottom  line is nuts and other specialty foods can be lucrative. Nuts  including almonds are shaken off trees and scooped off the ground  by machines, which means low labor costs and strong cash flows.  “Why wouldn’t anyone take a chance on a crop if it turns a  profit?” Rogers asked.', 'But food production choices have a broad reach in a global  agricultural economy. Almonds and other specialty crops can  require more water to produce. And it’s tough to turn your back  on an almond investment, despite high water costs, when global  demand for nuts including almonds is so strong. About 60 to 70  percent of California almonds are sold internationally.', '  In China, almonds are especially popular in autumn and winter.  Packaged nuts are an appreciated Lunar New Year gift. Almonds and  nuts are also a hit on China’s Singles’ Day, a big commerce day  that’s like America’s Black Friday. Nuts are popular because more  Chinese consumers are growing health conscious.', 'More Chinese consumers are also concerned about food safety and  seek imports. “If you have money and if the product is made  outside of China, the feeling is you have a bit more trust,” said  Jeff Walters of The Boston Consulting Group. “If you cruise a  food market in China and stroll down the nut aisle, the bags of  almonds are likely from California. Take a moment to inspect the  almond bag’s “Made in USA” labeling.  “The packaging will  have an American flag on it,” Walters said.', '  China’s growing appetite for nuts and more protein reflect larger  shifts among its middle class. The share of China’s urban  households with disposable incomes — high enough to afford  cars and small luxury items — is forecast to reach about 57  percent by 2020, according to forecasts from consultancy  McKinsey. While China broadly can feed its own people, the  food preferences of China’s higher earners — and their  growing appetite for Western-grown specialty crops — are  likely to reverberate throughout the agricultural landscape for  years to come. Food consumption patterns for many developing  regions follow a familiar path in tandem with rising incomes. “As  people get more wealthy, they tend to spend more money and tend  to go for high-quality food,” said Hal Sirkin, a senior partner  at The Boston Consulting Group. “That’s a universal trait.”', 'And whether talking about nuts or specialized dairy products,  there’s a larger philosophical question: Which crops feed more  people? As more farmers pursue high-value specialty crops —  many of them essentially luxury crops — and away from staple  crops, not everyone can afford the more expensive food that often  requires more water to produce. The elephant in the room is  whether an economic-driven preference for high-value crops over  low-value varieties is creating the equivalent of a 1 percent and  99 percent in our food complex. “It’s ironically the low-value  crops like rice, wheat, alfalfa that impacts everybody’s diet,  every day,” said Putnam of UC Davis. And farmers aren’t dummies. They’re  savvy, gambling start-up guys in overalls.', '  Lorren Wheaton farms citrus in Tulare County, not far from Ramos.  Wheaton’s late father farmed corn and raised cattle in the  Nebraska sandhills. Christmas back then brought an orange, apple,  nuts, some penny hard candy and maybe a repainted toy or two. In  the 1940s, the family headed west to California. Wheaton  eventually settled in Terra Bella. In the past two years, he has  shelled out $1 million-plus to keep his 300 acres alive in hopes  of a rain-soaked crop year.', '  It’s late afternoon and Wheaton relaxes in a living room chair,  flanked by photos of his children and grandchildren. Regional  Friant-Kern Canal authorities have allowed no surface water  deliveries for the past two years — the first time for zero  surface allotments since 1952. “If you do everything you can to  survive and you don’t make it, you can’t feel bad about it,”  Wheaton said. “It’s up to the land.”', '  Wheaton, Ramos and many other farmers are all fixated on El  Niño, a naturally occurring phenomenon that happens every  three to five years. When water temperatures rise in the eastern  Pacific during El Niño events, the warmer ocean  temperatures also alter the path and strength of high-level  atmospheric winds called jet streams. These powerful winds rake  across the Pacific from the west to east. Thunderstorms need some  warmth and humid air. So El Niño — and its supply of  warm ocean temperatures — triggers a lot of persistent  thunderstorms in the tropics. And these thunderstorms in the  tropical Pacific Ocean have significant impacts across the entire  Northern Hemisphere, including California.', '  “We do expect that this winter won’t be like it has been in the  last two winters in California,” said Todd Crawford, chief  meteorologist at WSI, a catastrophic weather forecaster, based in  Andover, Massachusetts. “But how wet, we don’t know yet.” But  early forecasts already suggest this El Niño could be  among the strongest on record before all is said and done.', '  The strong El Niño event has fueled some speculation it  might stretch well beyond spring 2016, into some kind of  back-to-back El Niño. But Crawford notes stronger El  Niño events typically weaken rather quickly. “El  Niño will likely end fairly quickly during early 2016,” he  said. “It would be a shock to have a conversation a year from now  about the current El Niño event.”', '  But forecasts don’t matter at the moment to laborers in Tulare  County. Three men — Victor Diaz, Fernando Hernandez and  Roman Moreno — break up remaining branches of citrus trees  that have been left to die for lack of water in the August heat.  The dry dirt is surprisingly dense and pliable. It’s like  stepping into deep, fluffy sand that compresses and collapses  under your shoes’ weight. The branches will be shipped to a  processor for mulching.', '  “We need rain,” said Diaz, who is from Porterville and has worked  and lived in the area all his life. Taking a break, Diaz leans  against a beat-up compact car, and crosses both sets of fingers.  “We are praying to baby Jesus that El Niño comes.”', 'It’s the tail end of summer and quieter in the Central Valley.

The social network didn’t threaten Google by building a better search engine. It did so by creating an entirely different online service, based around social networking and real identities, that drew people’s attention away from search and other Google properties. As people spent more and more time on Facebook, advertisers followed.', 'Google’s response? To launch a competing social network based on real identities called Google+.

', '  Thoth Technology, the Ontario-based company behind the invention,  told CNBC the elevator could transport 10 tons of cargo at  approximately seven miles per hour, with passengers able to reach  the top of the tower in about 60 minutes. Passengers could then  board a space plane that could reach lower orbit  without  the need for costly a rocket launch.', '  The elevator weighs about the same amount as a super crude tanker  ship and is expected to cost about $5 billion to build.

77,How 2017 became a turning point for tech giants,2017-12-13T14:03:37+0000,"['This was a terrible year for the tech industry.', 'That’s an odd thing to say at a time of record growth and profits. In 2017, large American tech companies have kept hauling in more money, more users, and — to a degree that might seem dystopian — they continued to expand their foothold in our lives. This was a year in which Amazon created a way for its delivery drivers to let themselves into your house, and Apple created a phone you can unlock with your face.', 'Yet underneath this apparent success was a momentous shift in how the tech business deals with the world. Five or 10 years from now, we will come to regard 2017 as a turning point.', 'Why? Because this year, for the first time, tech giants began to grudgingly accept that they have some responsibility to the offline world. The scope of that responsibility, though, is another matter entirely.', 'Let me explain how this is all playing out.', '“Platforms” are the shiniest prizes in the tech business. The reason the five most valuable American tech companies — Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Alphabet and Microsoft — are also the five most valuable American companies of any kind is that they own these fundamental building blocks of the digital economy, whether they are operating systems, app stores, social networks, cloud servers, or shipping and logistics infrastructure.', 'Think of these platforms as the roads, railroads and waterways of the information economy — an essentially inescapable part of life for any business or regular person who doesn’t live in a secluded cabin in the woods.', 'For years, despite their growing power, tech platforms rarely garnered much scrutiny, and they were often loathe to accept how much their systems affected the real world. Indeed, the online ethos has been that platforms aren’t really responsible for how people use them. It might as well be the slogan of Silicon Valley: We just make the tech, how people use it is another story.', 'In 2017, that changed. At first grudgingly and then with apparent enthusiasm, platform companies like Facebook began accepting some responsibility for how they are affecting the real world. They did not go as far as some critics would have liked — but in many significant ways they offered a shift in tone and tactics that suggested they were rethinking their positions.', 'You could argue that they had no choice. In the past year, social networks and search engines have been blamed for undermining the news media, fostering echo chambers, and spreading misinformation, hate, misogyny and other general social unpleasantness (YouTube, for example, removed lots of videos of kids gets getting pretend-tortured by their parents). There was also, of course, the unfolding saga of the companies’ role in Russia’s propaganda efforts, which resulted in them being hauled before lawmakers.', 'And then there were the larger questions about who makes the platforms and who benefits from them. The tech industry is overwhelmingly run by men, and it is a place of little racial and class diversity. A whistle-blowing blog post by Susan Fowler, an engineer who detailed a culture of harassment and misogyny at the ride-hailing company Uber, sparked a women’s movement in tech that was then subsumed by the global #MeToo movement.', 'Many tech titans were obviously unprepared for the serious questions that began coming their way a year ago. When the Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was asked about his site’s role in the 2016 election just days after Donald J. Trump’s victory, he responded with a line from tech’s old playbook: It was a “pretty crazy idea,” he said, that misinformation on Facebook had “influenced the election in any way.”', 'Now that tone is gone. Mr. Zuckerberg has apologized for his glibness. And during Facebook’s last earnings report to investors, he put the company’s social mission at the top of his agenda. “Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits,” he said.', 'Several other tech execs have expressed similar commitments to a deeper mission.

CenterNet Neutrality Protests Move Online, Yet Big Tech Is QuietI Was Wrong About Bitcoin. Here’s Why.', 'Sure, all this could just be marketing. But I’m inclined to believe the shift represents a new way of navigating the world, for a few reasons.', 'First, employees are demanding a new way. The highly paid workers of Silicon Valley were lured on the promise of changing the world, and in the past year many became demoralized about their companies’ apparent impact. In some cases they’re pushing their bosses to change.', 'Second, for the first time in years, there’s real pressure from lawmakers. That has resulted in some real-world retreats. For instance, tech giants last month stopped fighting a bill in Congress that would allow victims of sex trafficking to sue websites that supported the sex trade. In another time, this would have been a gimme for tech companies — they aren’t responsible for how people use their services, remember?', 'Not this time.', 'If the big shift of 2017 is that tech companies now accept some responsibility for how their platforms impact the world, the big mystery of 2018 and beyond is what, exactly, that responsibility will look like.', 'Mr. Zuckerberg said he was willing to risk the company’s profitability to improve its community. Facebook has been testing new ideas for making its News Feed less divisive and less prone to misinformation, and for promoting what the company calls “meaningful” social connections. Facebook is also testing systems that it said would more stringently police advertising, in the hope of preventing foreign actors from using its ad network to influence an election.', 'And in response to criticism from former Facebook employees that its tech might be addictive, the company said this week that it has conducted extensive research on the subject and was “using it to inform our product development.”', 'But what if these early efforts don’t mitigate the problems? What if Facebook finds that offering people a less polarized News Feed dramatically reduces engagement on its site, affecting its bottom line? Or what if the changes disproportionately affect one political ideology over another — would Facebook stick with a kind of responsibility that risks calling into question its impartiality?', 'I don’t mean to offer a barrage of hypotheticals just for the fun of it. My point is that these issues would probably be pretty hard to solve.', '“Just as the packaged food industry did in the 1950s, Facebook and Google have lured users with convenience, while feeding them a diet certain to cause lasting harm,” Roger McNamee, the musician and venture capitalist, told me. “The problem cannot be addressed by hiring; it can only be fixed by changing the algorithms in ways that will materially reduce profitability.”', 'Or consider the question of diversity. I asked Ellen Pao — the former Reddit chief executive who unsuccessfully sued the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers for gender discrimination — what she made of the industry’s efforts to address the issue this year.', '“I would give tech a C grade,” Ms. Pao, who is now the chief diversity and inclusion officer at the Kapor Center for Social Impact, wrote in an email. “Leaders are doing the bare minimum to address problems and are far from doing all that is necessary to solve the problem.”', 'She said she hoped for a far more vigorous effort that ushered in a complete overhaul of the culture of tech companies, and that held leaders accountable.', '“It means firing all the people involved in the failures, from the C.E.O. to the H.R. leaders to the board members in some cases,” she wrote.', 'Ms. Pao’s and Mr. McNamee’s comments underline the real problem for the industry. Once you accept that you’re on the hook for fixing problems caused by the thing you built, people will start to expect that you really will fix them — even if the solutions are expensive or otherwise conflict with your business interests.', 'So, yeah, 2017 was a terrible year for the tech industry.

', '  The same could not be said for JC Berg, a New York–based seller  who was early in spotting the hoverboard trend. ', 'Amazon had been  so eager to snap up inventory that it agreed to buy $1.5 million  worth of scooters from Berg, equal to about 4,000 hoverboards.', '  Berg held up his side of the deal, delivering the first 3,000  boards in a hurry. But he never received a penny. ', '  According to a $1.5 million fraud and breach of contract lawsuit Berg filed against Amazon in  October, the e-tailer tried to change the terms of the deal and  force Berg to accept “improper price concessions” when  cheaper hoverboards began showing up on its  marketplace. ', '  Berg, who started his business on Amazon in 2014 and was  generating several millions of dollars a year on the site, is now  cut off altogether. Even the electronics and office products  that he’d delivered in the past are no longer welcome. ', '  “We’ve been blackballed,” said Berg, who grew up in a family of  retailers in New York’s Diamond District. “They ceased purchase  orders across the board as the situation became more  contentious.”', 'Amazon is enjoying a banner 2016 heading into Christmas, with analysts forecasting annual revenue growth of 28 percent, the fastest expansion since 2011, according to FactSet. The Echo voice assistant is beloved by techies, and Prime subscribers are signing up by the millions with the promise of faster shipping on a wider array of goods and an expanding roster of original TV shows. ', 'But the contentiousness that Berg describes is being felt across the universe of sellers and vendors, where Amazon continues to flex its muscles in dealing with marketplace participants. The Seattle-based company’s behavior is raising the ire of frustrated merchants, creating a litigious holiday season for Amazon that goes way beyond hoverboards.', 'The primary complaint is that Amazon has failed to stop the spread of counterfeits, primarily from Chinese manufacturers, who are getting unfettered access to the market and selling knockoffs at prices that undercut the real thing.', 'Earlier this month, the maker of the Snuggie blanket teamed up with creators of other “As Seen on TV” products in an infringement and counterfeiting suit, alleging that Amazon openly contributes to the sale of inauthentic items. In September, a graphic designer whose art is sold on coffee mugs, T-shirts and magnets sued Amazon for impermissibly producing and selling items featuring her artwork, specifically a defecating unicorn. The case was settled this month.', 'Apple is going after problem vendors on Amazon, filing a counterfeit suit in October against a maker of imitation chargers and adapters.

How are they handling seller requests to take down infringing goods? We have not seen much movement, particularly when requested by smaller companies.”', 'But Berg’s hoverboard case is unique. It’s not about Amazon’s negligence toward counterfeits. Rather, it targets the company’s alleged bullying tactics, painting Amazon as an arrogant giant unwilling to honor a contract when market forces turn against it.', 'As the go-to shopping destination for consumers, Amazon has immense leverage over sellers, and Berg’s case illustrates how far the company will go to use it.', 'His story starts in the summer of 2015. Berg was betting that hoverboards would be in high demand for the holidays, and he contracted with a manufacturer in China to start producing them. Shortly after Berg signed up to sell hoverboards on Amazon, the company reached out to him to secure as much inventory as possible.', '“They were looking for large bulk purchases for the holiday season,” Berg said.', 'From October to November, Berg sent 3,000 boards to Amazon and was prepping another 1,000 for future delivery. As a vendor, Berg makes slim margins on almost everything he sells and counts on volume purchases to generate profit.', 'Over the next few weeks, Amazon started to backtrack. Legions of merchants were catching on to the demand. Third-party sellers were adding hoverboards by the truckload and at prices far below the $379 average price that Berg was charging Amazon. According to Statistic Brain, almost $1 billion worth of hoverboards were sold in the U.S. last year.', 'But the public narrative quickly shifted from rapid growth to horrific disaster. YouTube videos and Vines showed riders falling on their face and scooters bursting into flames. Publications like BuzzFeed, Wired and Quartz wrote about hoverboards catching fire in malls and on sidewalks and causing houses to burn to the ground. ', 'The threats quickly intensified and turned into mainstream concerns, with major airlines banning hoverboards from flights and New York City forbidding them from streets.  ', 'One particularly violent case recently erupted into a $30 million lawsuit against Amazon.', 'Brian and Megan Fox’s house in Nashville, Tennessee, went up in flames in January after a hoverboard they purchased two months earlier on Amazon spontaneously caught fire, destroying all of their possessions and physically and psychologically injuring their children. In the suit, the Foxes listed nine U.S. fires caused by hoverboards that were sold on Amazon between the time their family bought their scooter and the time it exploded. ', 'The suit said Amazon had an “ongoing duty” to warn consumers of dangers even if the company learned of them after the sale of related items.', '“The Amazon defendants knew that the lithium batteries in the hoverboards that it sold and/or distributed were being manufactured in an unsafe manner,” according to the complaint.', 'An Amazon spokesperson declined to respond to accusations in either the Berg or Fox lawsuit and declined to offer a comment for this story.', 'Working with the Consumer Product Safety Commission, Amazon agreed in late January — 12 days after the Fox family’s house burned down — to provide a refund to anyone who purchased a hoverboard on the site. The CPSC commended Amazon for “voluntarily stepping up, providing a free remedy and putting customer safety first.”', 'Given the millions of dollars in damage incurred and the mounting negative publicity, Amazon had little choice. The refund offer did nothing for Berg, who was helplessly seeking a solution with company representatives.', 'Back on Nov. 23, Berg logged onto his Amazon seller account only to find that the company had attempted to cancel $1 million worth of purchase orders, according to the lawsuit. Later that day, after contacting vendor support, Berg was told by email that his past and pending orders were canceled because his pricing wasn’t competitive with other listings. ', 'Amazon was also withholding another $70,000 it owed him for previous orders of office supplies and wireless products, Berg said.', '“They zeroed out our account,” he said.', 'Black Friday was four days away and Cyber Monday would arrive in just a week. ', '“Amazon began to leverage its enormous size, concomitant bargaining power, and media scrutiny surrounding self-balancing scooters in order to convince JC Berg to accept a lower price for inventory than the parties had originally agreed,” the lawsuit alleged.', 'With Christmas rapidly approaching, Berg was stuck in a bind. He couldn’t submit to Amazon’s demands to cut 30 to 40 percent off the pricing without losing hundreds of thousands of dollars. Yet Amazon had all of his inventory so he had no ability to sell it elsewhere.  ', 'Meanwhile, he worried that Amazon was playing fast and loose with a potentially dangerous product. Berg had spent time and resources performing due diligence on the boards he ordered. ', 'Based on the prices he was seeing from other vendors, he was certain that safety was being largely disregarded and that other manufacturers were likely using recycled batteries. To get thousands of boards through customs from China, Berg had to secure all the relevant safety documentation to show his products were compliant. However, third-party sellers could ship directly from China to consumers overseas with minimal restrictions. ', 'Outside sellers account for about half of units sold on Amazon. The company has long claimed that it doesn’t police the marketplace, but instead it serves as a platform to connect businesses and consumers.', 'Berg said he told the company, “I don’t know what you’re being offered, but we know based on our research and sourcing these products that there are a lot of funny things going on.”', 'In the Fox family’s case, Amazon was listed as the seller and shipper of the product on the package, though the company claims that it “did not in any way handle, package or mail the product,” according to the suit. ', 'The complaint said Amazon knew the lithium ion battery in the hoverboard was dangerous because of the mounting number of reported fires in late 2015. The scooter the Foxes purchased was represented as having a Samsung battery, but Samsung said it didn’t make that kind of component. ', 'Every entity from the supposed manufacturer of the hoverboard to the storefront listing the product has been difficult if not impossible to locate, even though the package arrived from a Kentucky subsidiary called Amazon.com.kydc, the suit said. ', '“Amazon has been unable despite our request to identify who the manufacturer was,” said Steve Anderson, the Fox family’s lead attorney, in an interview. “That seems like an unusual position — to not even know where the product is coming from.”', 'The swell of fires and explosions fed into Amazon’s change of tactics in its fight with Berg.', 'On Dec. 3, Amazon began demanding that Berg’s products comply with “voluntary safety standards.” Berg said he had provided all of the necessary details. On Christmas Eve, Berg was told that his hoverboards didn’t meet Amazon’s “terms and conditions,” meaning he was suddenly no longer authorized to even sell that type of product and his boards were being returned.', 'Two days later, Amazon began sending Berg’s inventory back to him, but the goods never arrived because the packages were being delivered to a post office box. So back to Amazon fulfillment centers went the scooters.', 'From there, Berg was sent through an Amazonian labyrinth. One representative said Amazon had received a complaint from scooter manufacturer Razor, demanding indemnification of Amazon by Berg, even though Berg was never forwarded the complaint. Later, the company rejected his safety data as not conforming to requirements. ', 'The company offered meek settlements, including the return of some cash and some boards. Berg agreed to an offer at one point, suspecting the company was negotiating in bad faith since Amazon didn’t have the hoverboards available that they were promising. After all, he could still see the inventory levels. ', 'Berg called the company’s bluff, and Amazon backed out of the deal. “They reneged and said the offer was no longer on the table,” he said.', 'Suing Amazon is never the preferred route, and Berg spent the first half of 2016 focused almost exclusively on finding a resolution. ', 'He was unsuccessful, and there was very little money coming in the door. Having realized that litigation was his only option, Berg had to let go of a handful of employees who worked on the Amazon account. ', 'In recent months, Berg has returned to building up his wholesale business off of Amazon, selling computer accessories and office supplies to small and regional physical retailers.', '“Our revenue numbers are a joke compared to previous years,” he said.', 'While Berg hopefully awaits a trial, Amazon remains in the hoverboard business.  A simple search for hoverboards on Amazon.com returns pages of self-balancing scooters and peripherals.', 'Unlike last year’s free-for-all, there are restrictions today. The CPSC issued a recall in July on hoverboards from 10 companies, representing about 501,000 units. ', 'A set of voluntary electrical standards was then created and identified as UL 2272. On its website, Amazon has a list of seven requirements for selling the scooters, including certification under that code.', '“There was no safety standard in place,” said Patty Davis, deputy director and press secretary at the CPSC. “There is now.”', 'Safety may finally be in order, but Berg’s problem, like that of other vendors, persists.', 'Berg said he’s totally in the dark about the whereabouts of his hoverboards. As of Monday, according to his vendor dashboard, Amazon had 19 sellable boards from Berg worth $7,200. (The company still owes him over $1 million, Berg said. The rest of the cash he’s demanding is for damages.)', 'Berg isn’t convinced that anyone at Amazon has much of a clue about where his close to 3,000 hoverboards reside.', '“We have no idea what happened,” he said.']"

It’s  unclear when Park will officially resign, or if her future lies  in impeachment instead. Opposition parties intend to introduce an  impeachment motion in parliament as early as Friday.', '  Even before the scandal hit, South Korea was already battling an  economic morass. Over the past two years, exports have only seen  one month of gains amid a slowdown in China, the country’s  largest trading partner.

Problems  at these blue-chip chaebols were weakening Korea’s brand globally  and helping depress the economy, Nagy noted.', '  Chaebols are the backbone of the Korean economy, but they are  often linked with unfair business practices and uneven power  distribution, resulting in widespread calls for massive  restructuring and better governance. Several, including Samsung,  LG, SK Group, Hanwha, Hanjin and Posco, were being investigated  after they were found to be implicated in Choi-gate, adding to  growing public frustration.', '  But the messy political situation implied “limited space for  policy progress to address structural weakness,” Natixis warned  in a recent note.', '  Still, there’s more hope for labor reforms because of sizable  support from the opposition.', '  Parliament is expected to pass several bills designed to tighten  laws for chaebols before the current session ends on Dec. 9.

We’ll pay for the wall, Mexico will pay us back, OK?', '  “The End Illegal Immigration act fully funds the construction of  a wall on our southern border,” Trump said on October 22nd,  outlining the plans for his first 100 days in office. “With the  full understanding that the country of Mexico will be reimbursing  the United States for the full cost of such a wall, OK?”', '  Current position: Trump says he will deport millions, but he has  not ruled out creating a pathway to citizenship. He’ll build a  wall, pay for said wall, but later he’ll get reimbursed by  Mexico.', ' YOUNG UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS AND CHILDREN OF ILLEGAL  IMMIGRANTS', '  1. Dreamers can maybe stay.', '  Trump wavered on what to do with the Dreamers — young  undocumented immigrants who were brought to this country by their  parents as children who are now afforded limited protection from  deportation via the DREAM Act but no path to citizenship.', '  When asked if Dreamers would have to go back, he said, “It  depends.”', '  2. Nope, they can’t stay.', '  By August 2015, that ambiguity was gone: “They have to go,” he  said on “Meet the Press.”', '  3. End birthright citizenship.', '  Trump first proposed ending the 14th Amendment — the  Constitutional provision that grants citizenship to those born in  the country — last August. This is something few in his  party agree on, and it’s even more unclear how it would be  applied: Does it apply to children of mixed status parents, where  one parent is illegal? Or simply those with two undocumented  immigrant parents? Would he revoke the citizenship of the  estimated 4.5 million children born to illegal immigrants already  here?', '  The Trump campaign did not answer questions from reporters at the  time.', '  4. “American children” also deserve dreams.', '  “Where is the sanctuary for American children?” Trump asked  during a late August rally while alluding Dreamers.', '  “The dreamers we never talk about are the young Americans. Why  aren’t young Americans dreamers also? I want my dreamers to be  young Americans,” he said, offering up a rhetorical device in  place of policy.', '  Current position: Deport children benefiting from the DREAM Act,  repeal the 14th Amendment to end birthright citizenship.', ' PROPOSED MUSLIM BAN', '  1. No Muslims should be allowed to enter the United States  —as immigrants or visitors.', '  Donald Trump called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims  entering the United States” in a statement about “preventing  Muslim immigration” in December.', '  2. Ban Muslims from entering but make an exception for friends  and Muslims serving in the US military.', '  He later amended his stance in an interview with Fox News, saying  the 5,000 Muslims serving the United States military would be  exempt from the ban and allowed to return home from overseas  deployments. He also suggested that current Muslim residents  — like his “many Muslim friends” — would be exempt,  too, and able to come and go freely.', '  3. The Muslim ban was just an suggestion.', '  “We have a serious problem, and it’s a temporary ban - it hasn’t  been called for yet, nobody’s done it, this is just a suggestion  until we find out what’s going on,” Trump said on in mid-May,  softening for the first time in months on the ban.', '  4. Ban Muslims as a matter of policy, as well as people from  countries with a history of terrorism.', '  In a national security address after the terror attack in  Orlando, Trump said that if he’s elected he would “suspend  immigration from areas of the world where there’s a proven  history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our  allies until we fully understand how to end these threats.”', '  5. Ban people from countries with a history of terrorism.', '  When a reporter asked Trump how he’d feel about a Muslim Scot  entering the U.S. while on a trip to visit his golf courses in  Scotland, Trump said it “wouldn’t bother me.” He then went on to  emphasize that he did not want “people coming in from the terror  countries.” When asked, Trump would not name one such  country.', '  6. Ban Muslims from countries with a history of terrorism, and  potentially also other Muslims.', '  That same day, when pressed about how his statement in Scotland  jived with Trump’s proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the  country, spokesman Hope Hicks said that the ban would just apply  to Muslims from countries with a history of terrorism. She would  not, however, confirm that Muslims residing in peaceful countries  would be exempt.', '  7. The Muslim ban was never about Muslims.', '  The next week, a top spokesperson said the initial ban was not  about Muslims.', '  “I know the news media has been reporting that the initial ban  was against all Muslims, and that simply was not the case. It’s  simply for Muslim immigration, and Mr. Trump is adding specifics  to clarify what his position is,” Katrina Pierson told CNN,  though advisers at the time said it was indeed about religion  exclusively.', '  8. Nothing has changed, nothing to see here.', '  “This is not accurate,” spokesperson Hope Hicks said when asked  if the policies were changing and removing the word “Muslim.”  “There has been no change from the exchanges over the  weekend.”', '  9. The ban is negotiable.', '  Then-campaign manager Paul Manafort in late May said the Muslim  ban was negotiable, and how Trump initially articulated it was  not what it would turn out in the end. Manafort said the policy  is currently that “where there is terrorist activity — Syria  or Iraq — we will temporarily suspend immigration until we  can establish a vetting system in which we can identify who  people are who are coming in.”', '  The government already has a rigorous, nine-step vetting process  in place for refugees. Trump has previously included all Syrian  refugees, including children and non-Muslims, in the ban.', '  10. The ban would call for “extreme vetting.”', '  Mid July, Trump told “60 Minutes” that people from suspicious  “territories” would receive “a thing called ‘extreme vetting.’”  He did not describe how “extreme vetting” would differ from the  current vetting process.', '  “Call it whatever you want,” Trump told CBS when asked if he was  changing his previously released policy.', '  11. The ban hasn’t changed, I just don’t like saying the word  “Muslim.”', '  On Fox News in late July, Trump told Sean Hannity his position  hadn’t changed from his initial ban on Muslims entering the  country.', '  “I think my position’s gotten bigger, I’m talking about  territories now. People don’t want me to say Muslim—I guess  I’d prefer not saying it, frankly, myself. So we’re talking about  territories.”', '  12. There’s a ban, plus “extreme vetting” that includes an  ideological test.', '  “The time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the  threats we face today,” Trump said in a speech in mid-August that  reiterated his call for “extreme vetting” and reiterated that  he’d temporarily ban immigration from some countries that he  declined to identify.', '  He then proposed an ideological test for immigration.', '  “In addition to screening out all members or sympathizers of  terrorist groups, we must also screen out any who have hostile  attitudes toward our country or its principles ― or who  believe that Sharia law should supplant American law,” he  said.', '  13. There’s no way to really do an ideological test.', '  “We don’t know if they have love or hate in their heart,” Trump  said in September, articulating the problem many onlookers have  expressed about his ban. “There’s no way to tell.”', '  14. Only people who love America are allowed.', '  Later, despite acknowledging the impossibility of the task, Trump  maintained that an ideological test is key to the nation’s  immigration system.', '  “We want to make sure we’re only admitting those into our country  who support our values and love - and I mean love - our people,”  he said.', '  15. The ban has “morphed.”', '  Trump was pressed on whether or not the Muslim ban still exists  during the second presidential debate, and insisted that it was  now only extreme vetting.', '  “The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into  an extreme vetting from certain areas of the world,” Trump said,  without actually saying whether or not the ban on travel still  stands. “It’s called extreme vetting.”', '  Current position: Trump will not say whether or not he intends to  ban people of Muslim faith from the U.S., but he will say that  “extreme vetting” will apply to people from certain countries.  It’s unclear where those countries are, what “extreme vetting”  entails or how he intends to institute an ideological test for  entry.', ' VISAS FOR HIGH-SKILLED WORKERS', '  1. H-1B visas are bad for American workers.', '  Trump’s immigration plan was published on his website in August  2015: it opposed the H-1B program, which allows non-immigrant  visas for specialty occupations, arguing then that it was bad for  American workers.', '  2. H-1B visas are good.', '  At the CNBC debate in October, Trump denied that he’d been  critical about the program. “I am all in favor of keeping these  talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley,”  he said.', '  3. H-1B visas are still bad, according to Trump’s unchanged  website.', '  At the Fox News debate on March 3, some five months later, Fox  News host Megyn Kelly pressed Trump on which of these conflicting  views he supports.', '  4. H-1B visas are necessary: ‘I’m changing.’', '  “I’m changing. I’m changing. We need highly skilled people in  this country. If we can’t do it, we will get them in. And we do  need in Silicon Valley, we absolutely have to have. So we do need  highly skilled,” he said.', '  5. H-1B visas are definitely bad.', '  His campaign later released a statement reversing this shortly  after the March 3 debate ended.', '  “Megyn Kelly asked about highly skilled immigration. The H-1B  program is neither high-skilled nor immigration: These are  temporary foreign workers, imported from abroad, for the explicit  purpose of substituting for American workers at lower pay,” Trump  wrote in a statement. “I will end forever the use of the H-1B as  a cheap labor program and institute an absolute requirement to  hire American workers first for every visa and immigration  program. No exceptions.”', '  He reaffirmed this position in the GOP debate on March 10, one  week later, vowing to end the program that he noted he uses  himself as a businessman.', '  Current position: Back where he started — against the H-1B  visa program.', ' BORDER CONTROL AND THE REFUGEE CRISIS', '  1. The U.S. has a ‘humanitarian’ obligation to take in some  Syrian refugees.', '  Trump initially said the country should absorb Syrian  refugees.', '  “I hate the concept of it, but on a humanitarian basis, you have  to,” Trump told Bill O’Reilly on Fox News on a Tuesday night in  September. “But you know, it’s living in hell in Syria. There’s  no question about it. They’re living in hell, and something has  to be done.”', '  2. The U.S. cannot and should not accept Syrian refugees.', '  The next day, Trump said the country couldn’t welcome refugees  fleeing the Syrian civil war.', '  “Look, from a humanitarian standpoint, I’d love to help. But we  have our own problems,” he said on Fox.', '  During the March debate, Trump defended his changing view.', '  “First time the question had been put to me, it was very early  on. The migration had just started. And I had heard that the  number was a very, very small number. By the second day, two or  three days later, I heard the number was going to be thousands  and thousands of people. You know, when they originally heard  about it, they were talking about bringing very, very small  numbers in, and I said, begrudgingly, well, I guess maybe that’s  OK,” Trump said. “By the time I went back and studied it, and  they were talking about bringing thousands and thousands, I  changed my tune. And I don’t think there’s anything wrong with  that.”', '  3. Close the border.', '  “I’d close up our borders to people until we figure out what is  going on,” Trump said on Fox News the morning of the Brussels  attacks claimed by ISIS that killed at least 28 and injured more  than 270.', '  4. Don’t close the border, just be careful.', '  “I didn’t say shut it down — I said you have to be very  careful, you have to be careful on who’s coming into our  country,” he said the same day as the Fox News interview on CBSN,  reiterating that people from Syria without papers shouldn’t be  allowed in.', '  Current position: Against closing the borders entirely. Against  accepting Syrian refugees in the United States.', ' DEFEATING ISIS', '  1. Maybe send troops in. Definitely go after the oil fields.', '  In Trump’s first interview after announcing his bid, he signaled  that he’d both send in ground troops to Iraq and not send in  ground troops.', '  “You bomb the hell out of them, and then you encircle it, and  then you go in,” he told Bill O’Reilly, who remarked that the  plan necessitated ground forces. “I disagree, I say that you can  defeat ISIS by taking their wealth — their wealth is the  oil.”', '  2. Bomb the oil fields. Send some troops in.', '  On CNN, Trump said, “I would bomb the hell out of those oil  fields. I wouldn’t send many troops because you won’t need them  by the time I’m finished.”', '  3. Send troops to defeat ISIS. Don’t forget about the oil fields.', '  In a single August interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” he  offered three solutions for what to do with the oil field  profits: keep them, give them to veterans and their families, or,  when pressed, perhaps give some to the Iraqi people.', '  Months later, in a March debate, Trump ballparked the number of  troops he would need to send in to defeat ISIS.', '  “We really have no choice, we have to knock out ISIS,” Trump  said. “I would listen to the generals, but I’m hearing numbers of  20,000-30,000.”', '  4. I’ve got this! I know more than the generals.', '  “I know more about ISIS than the generals do,” Trump said in  November in Iowa. “Believe me.”', '  5. Destroy the oil. Let our regional allies send ground troops.  If they don’t, stop buying their oil.', '  In a foreign-policy focused interview with the New York Times  published March 26, Trump said that the U.S. should “take” ISIS’  oil, but then said the U.S. should “knock the hell out of the oil  and do it because it’s a primary source of money for ISIS.” Trump  also ruled out sending in U.S. troops, saying that other  countries in the region — “regional Arab partners” such as  Saudi Arabia — should provide the ground troops. If these  countries did not, the United States would stop buying their oil  and withhold “protection” in the region.', '  6. Declare war, send in some troops.', '  “We’re going to declare war against ISIS. We have to wipe out  ISIS,” Trump said in his first interview with running mate Gov.  Mike Pence. “I am going to have very few troops on the ground.  We’re going to have unbelievable intelligence, which we need;  which, right now, we don’t have. We don’t have the people over  there.”', '  Trump said he’d involve NATO, despite the fact that he has said  the U.S. should withdraw from NATO, and the surrounding states,  as well. He added that Hillary Clinton created ISIS. (PolitiFact  deemed this statement to be false.)', '  7. I’m going to ask the generals.', '  Months after saying he knew more than the generals, Trump said in  early September that he’d ask them to map out a plan for  defeating ISIS.', '  “Immediately after taking office, I will ask my generals to  present to me a plan within 30 days to defeat and destroy ISIS,”  he said. “This will require military warfare, but also cyber  warfare, financial warfare, and ideological warfare.”', '  8. He’s got a plan, and he’ll tell you if asked.', '  “I’ve heard it,” Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said on  MSNBC. “He’ll tell you if that question is asked. He’ll be happy  to offer specifics without telling the enemy exactly what we’re  going to do.”', '  9. Do more with computers.', '  Trump cited his 10-year-old’s proficiency with computers to argue  that the U.S. needed to better fight ISIS using the  internet.', '  “When you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they’re  beating us at our own game, ISIS,” Trump said. “So we have to get  very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is — it is a  huge problem. I have a son. He’s 10 years old. He has computers.  He is so good with these computers, it’s unbelievable. The  security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it’s  hardly doable.”', '  Current position: It’s still unclear what Trump’s plan to defeat  ISIS is, but it will involve computers and it will be  tough.', ' GUNS', '  1. Get rid of gun-free zones', '  In a speech at the National Rifle Association convention on May  20, where Trump was endorsed by the country’s most powerful gun  group, Trump promised again to do away with gun-free zones, which  include schools and military bases. At a campaign stop in  Vermont, he had previously vowed to get rid of gun-free zones on  his “first day.”', '  2. No guns in classrooms, except maybe some guns in  classrooms.', '  In an interview on May 22, Trump advocated against, and then for,  and then against, and then for guns in classrooms.', '  “I don’t want to have guns in classrooms, although in some cases,  teachers should have guns in classrooms, frankly,” Trump said,  offering up two distinct views in an interview days after he was  endorsed the NRA. “Because teachers, you know — things that  are going on in our schools are unbelievable.”', '  3. I’m not advocating for guns in classrooms, but wait, yes I  am.', '  Trump walked back his view that teachers should have guns a  second later, then reiterated that some teachers should have  guns.', '  “I’m not advocating guns in classrooms,” he continued. “But  remember, in some cases … trained teachers should be able to  have guns in classrooms.”', '  4. Let’s put trained gunmen in schools.', '  Forty-eight hours later, Trump sought to clarify his muddled  remarks, saying he wanted “school resource officers” to have guns  in schools while slamming rival Hillary Clinton’s criticism of  his stance.', '  “The way she said it meant like every student should be sitting  there carrying guns,” Trump said on CNN on May 24. “If trained  people had guns, you wouldn’t have the carnage that you’ve  had.”', '  5. We should only get rid of some gun-free zones.', '  While he decried gun-free zones as “offering up candy to bad  people,” he backed away from axing all of them, telling CNN in  the May 24 interview that they would only be eliminated “in some  cases.”', '  6. More guns would save lives.', '  Trump has repeatedly said that he wished there were other armed  individuals present during terror attacks to fight back.', '  “I think it would’ve been a lot better if they had guns in that  room, somebody could protect,” Trump said after the San  Bernardino shooting in December. “They could’ve protected  themselves if they had guns.”', '  In the wake of the deadly shooting in Orlando, Florida at a gay  nightclub in June, Trump reiterated this view.', '  “It’s too bad that some of the young people that were killed over  the weekend didn’t have guns, you know, attached to their hips,  frankly, and you know where bullets could have flown in the  opposite direction,” he said on the “Howie Carr Show” on June 13,  one day after the attack. “They had a security guard. Other than  that there were no guns in the room. Had people been able to fire  back, it would have been a much different outcome.”', '  At a rally in Atlanta on June 15, Trump declared that the outcome  would have been different if “some of those great people that  were in that club that night had guns strapped to their waist or  strapped to their ankle.”', '  7. I didn’t actually mean arming clubgoers.', '  After he spent a week advocating for arming more of the victims  (who were predominantly clubgoers, in addition to several club  employees), Trump tweeted on June 20 that he didn’t mean he  wanted to arm clubgoers. Trump changed his stance just hours  after the National Rifle Association pushed back against the idea  of allowing people to bring weapons into nightclubs.', '  “I was obviously talking about additional guards or employees,”  Trump tweeted.', '  Current position: More guns are better, though the details are  murky and evolving on how many gun-free zones would be  abolished.', ' ‘FIRST USE’ AND NUCLEAR ARMS', '  1. I wouldn’t strike first.', '  Asked during the first presidential debate about whether he’d  support ’first use,” an un-official U.S. prohibition on the use  of nuclear weapons against enemies who don’t have nuclear  capability, Trump said he wouldn’t strike first against rivals --  a completely different issue.', '  “I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it,” he said  of nuclear weapons. “But I would certainly not do first  strike.”', '  2. Or maybe I would.', '  Shortly after saying he wouldn’t do the first strike, Trump then  reversed himself.', '  “At the same time, we have to be prepared. I can’t take anything  off the table. Because you look at some of these countries, you  look at North Korea, we’re doing nothing there,” he said.', '  Current Position: It’s unclear where Trump stands on “first use,”  or if he’d be willing to strike first.', ' MINIMUM WAGE', '  1. Against raising the minimum wage. Jobs would move to China.', '  During the thick of the primaries, Trump repeatedly argued that  raising the minimum would move jobs to countries like China.  Speaking in the cold language of a businessman looking at his  bottom line, Trump even seemed to indicate overall American  wages, regardless of the law, were too generous already.', '  “Taxes too high, wages too high, we’re not going to be able to  compete against the world,” Trump said in a November debate  hosted by Fox Business. Trump clarified afterwards that he did  not believe American wages were too high, but he did make crystal  clear he was fundamentally opposed to a minimum wage  increase.', '  2. Wages should be raised through economic growth.', '  Trump in an interview with CNBC in May said he would prefer to  try to raise wages through economic growth. His abrupt move  toward a possible increase that he opposed in tough terms is a  significant general election shift.', '  3. Raise the minimum wage.', '  “I am looking at it, and I haven’t decided in terms of numbers.  But I think people have to get more,” Trump said on ABC on May 8,  acknowledging that his statement was a shift when pressed.', '  “Sure, it’s a change. I’m allowed to change,” he said. “But my  real minimum wage is going to be — I’m going to bring  companies back into this country, and they’re going to make a lot  more than the $15 even.”', '  4. Get rid of the federal minimum wage, leave it to the  states.', '  On NBC on the same day, Trump said more specifically that he  wanted states to mandate wages.', '  “Let me just tell you, I’ve been traveling the country for many  months. Since June 16, I’m all over,” he said. “I have seen  what’s going on. And I don’t know how people make it on $7.25 an  hour. Now, with that being said, I would like to see an increase  of some magnitude. But I’d rather leave it to the states. Let the  states decide. Because don’t forget, the states have to compete  with each other.”', '  5. I want to increase it!', '  In a May 11 tweet criticizing Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth  Warren, Trump argued that he was “asking for increase” of the  federal minimum wage.', '  6. States should change it, but it will hurt them.', '  “I actually think that the states should make the decision,”  Trump said in an interview with a Seattle radio station, but  argued that “In some cases, states are going to become  noncompetitive, and they’re going to start losing maybe jobs and  losing business, and they’re going to have to readjust.  Otherwise, they’re just not going to have anything.”', '  7. Let’s make it $10 dollars an hour.', '  As the Washington Post notes, Trump’s shift here are lengthy and  significant: He says he would support raising it to $10 an hour,  argues he never wanted to abolish the federal minimum wage, which  he did.', '  8. It should go up, but states should call the shots here.', '  In a June news conference, Trump said “the minimum wage has to go  up. People are — at least $10, but it has to go up. But I  think that states — federal — I think that states  should really call the shot.”', '  Current position: Raise it to $10 an hour, ignore what I said  before.', ' TAXES', '  1. The wealthy should pay more.', '  “I would take carried interest out, and I would let people making  hundreds of millions of dollars a year pay some tax, because  right now they are paying very little tax and I think it’s  outrageous,” Trump told Bloomberg last August, noting that he’d  be OK paying more taxes. “I want to lower taxes for the middle  class.”', '  2. Cut taxes for the wealthy big time.', '  In September, Trump released a plan that silenced anti-tax  critics with a proposal that slashed taxes for the wealthy by  making the top marginal tax rate 25 percent. He radically  simplified the tax plan by proposing just three brackets, 10  percent, 20 percent, and 25 percent. A whopping 67 percent of the  overall cost of his individual tax cuts would go to the top 20  percent of earners, while 35 percent of it would go to the top 1  percent, according to the Tax Policy Center’s analysis.', '  His plan is estimated to cut $10 trillion in tax revenue, which  would be added to the national debt and deficit over a decade  (more on Trump’s flip-flopping position on paying off the  national debt below). It’s unclear how Trump would pay for such  drastic cuts, but Trump insisted he could do it by offering the  vague promise of striking better deals and cutting government  waste.', '  3. People like me should pay more.', '  Trump was asked again in April during a “TODAY” town hall if he  believed in raising taxes on the wealthy. Despite the big tax  cuts for the wealthy outlined in his own tax plan, he said:', '  “I do, I do, including myself. I do.”', '  In a series of interviews in early May, he claimed that his tax  proposal was a starting point for negotiations and the taxes on  the rich would go up.', '  On Sunday, May 8, Trump told ABC that taxes on the wealthy would  “go up a little bit” in negotiations and that, as a wealthy  person himself, he is personally OK with higher taxes. “I am  willing to pay more. And you know what? Wealthy are willing to  pay more. We’ve had a very good run,” he said.', '  He told NBC’s Chuck Todd something similar: It’s all  negotiable.', '  “Under my proposal, it’s the biggest tax cut by far, of any  candidate by far. But I’m not under the illusion that that’s  going to pass. They’re going to come to me. They’re going to want  to raise it for the rich. Frankly, they’re going to want to raise  it for the rich more than anybody else,” Trump said. “But the  middle class has to be protected. The rich is probably going to  end up paying more. And business might have to pay a little bit  more. But we’re giving a massive business tax cut.”', '  Pressed on that last, confusing point - that business might pay  more but also get a tax cut - Trump said he meant more than his  existing proposal: “Excuse me. I said they might have to pay a  little bit more than my proposal.”', '  He didn’t offer such a qualification for the wealthy until the  next day.', '  4. I never said that. Cut everyone’s taxes!', '  On Monday, May 9, he went on CNN to refute what he’d said the day  before.', '  “I said that I may have to increase on the wealthy — I’m not  going to allow it to be increased on the middle class — now,  if I increase it on the wealthy, that means they’re still going  to be paying less than they’re paying now. I’m not increasing it  from this point, I’m talking about increasing from my tax  proposal,” Trump told CNN, insisting that overall there would be  a tax decrease for the rich and middle class alike.', '  5. Maybe don’t slash taxes by $10 trillion — slash taxes by  $3 trillion, instead.', '  Trump senior economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Wednesday at an  RNC event that the tax plan had been revised to only slash taxes  by $3 trillion — a third of what was initially proposed  — and lower the top individual tax rate to between 30-33  percent, up from the 25 percent initially proposed but below the  current top tax rate of 39.6 percent. The campaign did not  confirm this.', '  6. Scrap the earlier plan entirely. Here are new tax  brackets.', '  Trump took his earlier tax plan offline before a major economic  policy address in early August, where he hiked his initially  proposed tax brackets from 10 percent, 20 percent and 25 percent  to 12 percent, 25 percent and 33 percent. These brackets more  closely mimic his party’s past views on taxes.', '  7. Maybe ditch, maybe keep a $1 trillion tax cut for small  businesses (depending on who is asking).', 'Trump publicly backed away from a trillion-dollar tax cut aimed  at small businesses in order to optimistically claim that his tax  plan won’t add to the debt. But his campaign privately told a  leading small business group he’d keep it.', 'His campaign then reiterated to the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan  group that analyzes tax plans, that he’d definitely get rid of  it, according to a report by the New York Times on what they  called a “trillion-dollar lie.”', 'Current position: Despite Trump’s frequent talk about helping  working people, his tax plan so far seems to mostly benefit the  wealthy. It’s unclear whether or not his plan will include that  small business tax cut.', '  CLIMATE CHANGE', '  1. I don’t believe in it.', '“I don’t believe in climate change,” he told CNN in September  after a long history of calling it both a hoax and a Chinese  invention to undermine U.S. business interests. In May 2016, he  vowed to “renegotiate … at a minimum” the Paris climate  agreement, one of the Obama administration’s landmark  achievements.', '2. Global warming is threatening one of my golf courses.', 'A statement of environmental impact filed by the Trump  International Golf Links & Hotel Ireland, owned by Trump,  cited rising sea levels and extreme weather due to global warming  as the reason the company needed to build a seawall to protect  its coastal resort, Politico reported Monday. The sea wall is  necessary protect the course from “global warming and its  effects.”', '3. I never said climate change was a hoax.', 'During the first presidential debate in late September, Trump  denied ever saying climate change was a hoax perpetuated by the  Chinese (though you can still read his tweet on the matter here.)', '4. Trump believes in climate change, but not that it’s man-made.', 'Trump’s campaign manager offered a more common Republican theory  to explain Trump’s views: Climate change is real, but it’s  “naturally occurring.”', 'Current position: Global warming is real, but it’s not man-made.', '  NATIONAL DEBT', '  1. Get rid of the national debt in 8 years.', 'On March 31, Trump told the Washington Post that the country  needed to eliminate the national debt and that he could do it  “fairly quickly” without raising taxes.', '“I would say over a period of eight years,” he said, arguing he  could do it simply by renegotiating the country’s trade deals.  “I’m renegotiating all of our deals, Bob. The big trade deals  that we’re doing so badly on. With China, $505 billion this year  in trade. We’re losing with everybody.”', '2. Only pay down a little. Invest in infrastructure first.', 'Three weeks later, he told Fortune “you could pay off a  percentage of it” in a decade but he wouldn’t advise being too  aggressive because the country’s infrastructure needs to be  rebuilt and it’s a good time to borrow.', '“It depends on how aggressive you want to be. I’d rather not be  so aggressive,” he said. “Don’t forget: We have to rebuild the  infrastructure of our country. We have to rebuild our military,  which is being decimated by bad decisions. We have to do a lot of  things. We have to reduce our debt, and the best thing we have  going now is that interest rates are so low that lots of good  things can be done that aren’t being done, amazingly.”', 'It’s an argument progressive liberal economists like Paul Krugman  could have (and actually have) made. Not only is it far from his  original position, it’s far from his party’s view on the issue.', '3. Pay off the debt by getting America’s creditors to accept  less.', 'Despite the U.S. economy being fundamentally grounded in its  ability to borrow at very low interest rates, Trump told CNBC  that he would negotiate with creditors to get them to accept less  than the full amount owed.', '“I would borrow, knowing that if the economy crashed, you could  make a deal,” Trump said.', 'Experts say this idea is pure fantasy, no matter how good Trump’s  deal-making skills are. In addition to imperiling the economy,  the proposal could also be unconstitutional.', '4. Don’t worry about it — the U.S. can’t default because we  “print the money.”', 'A week after suggesting that he could get U.S. creditors to  accept less than the full amount, Trump defended his stance on  CNN by calling himself “the king of debt” and railing against  publications that reported his earlier proposal.', '“People said I want to go and buy debt and default on debt, and I  mean, these people are crazy. This is the United States  government,” he said on CNN on May 9.” “First of all, you never  have to default because you print the money, I hate to tell you,  OK?”', 'He then advocated for buying back some of the government’s debt  at a discount, using interest rates to save the country money.  It’s a strategy that works may work for businesses but would be  more difficult, if not impossible for the U.S. government,  economists told the Washington Post.', '“I understand debt better than probably anybody. I know how to  deal with debt very well. I love debt — but you know, debt  is tricky and it’s dangerous, and you have to be careful and you  have to know what you’re doing,” Trump said.', '5. I won’t try to renegotiate the national debt.', '“We have to start chopping that debt down,” Trump told CBS in  June. “I wouldn’t renegotiate the debt. I’d negotiate, if I do a  deal in a corporation, as an example, and if the economy goes  bad, I’ll oftentimes renegotiate that debt. But that’s a  different thing. That’s just a corporate thing. And other people  like me, very big people in the world of business, they do that.”', '6. Take out new loans and pay back debt with new debt.', '“I think it could be a good time to borrow and pay off debt,  borrow debt, make longer-term debt,” he said in the same June CBS  interview.', '7. My plans are deficit neutral.', '“It will be deficit neutral,” Trump said of his economic plan  released in September. “It will be accomplished through a  complete overhaul of our tax, regulatory, energy and trade  policies.”', '8. Maybe borrow $10 trillion.', 'One of Trump’s advisers echoed the skepticism many had of Trump’s  plans: that they would cost a lot more than Trump’s tax plan  would bring in.', 'Tom Barrack, an adviser, said Trump’s policies would increase the  national debt by $10 trillion — money the nation would have  to borrow to accomplish Trump’s plans.', 'Current position: Either “chop” the national debt using an  approach that is still unclear, or add $10 trillion to the debt  to accomplish plans.', '  ABORTION', '  1. Criminalize women who have abortions.', 'Though Trump said in 1999 that he was “very pro-choice,” Trump  has consistently claimed that he’s against abortion, except for  in cases of rape, incest, or to save the mother’s life, since  starting his bid last June.', 'But during an exclusive interview with MSNBC’s Chris Matthews  just after 1 p.m., Trump struggled to define his views on  abortion aside from describing himself as “pro-life.” When  continually pressed for how he’d handle women who violated a  theoretical ban on abortion, Trump said the “answer is that there  has to be some form of punishment, yeah.”', '2. Let the states decide what to do about criminalizing abortion.', 'At 3:36 p.m., Trump put out a statement saying the issue is  “unclear and should be put back into the states for  determination.”', '3. Never mind. Don’t punish the women.', 'He fully walked back his position that women should be punished  for violating a theoretical abortion ban 80 minutes later,  releasing a statement saying “the doctor or any other person  performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally  responsible, not the woman. The woman is a victim in this case as  is the life in her womb.”', '4. Probably overturn Roe v. Wade, then let states handle it.', 'Pressed three times in the final presidential debate on whether  he hoped his anti-abortion Supreme Court nominees should overturn  Roe v. Wade, Trump said “that will happen automatically in my  opinion. Because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.”', 'He went on to say that after it’s overturned states should handle  it: “I will say this. It will go back to the states and the  states will then make a determination.”', 'Current position: Overturn Roe v. Wade, then let states decide  it.', ' WHETHER PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS BORN IN AMERICA', '  1. I don’t know.', '  “I really don’t know. I mean, I don’t know why he wouldn’t  release his records. But you know, honestly, I don’t want to get  into it,” Trump said in July 2015, asked about his inaccurate,  years-long insistence that the president wasn’t born in the  United States. (President Obama had released his long form birth  certificate in 2011.)', '  2. I don’t want to answer the question.', '  “I don’t talk about that anymore,” Trump said on MSNBC in  December 2015 in response to a question about whether or not he  believed President Obama was born in the United States.', '  3. I’ll explain my theory one day.', '  “Who knows [if Obama is a natural-born citizen]? Who knows? Who  cares right now? We’re talking about something else, OK? I’m  going to have my own theory on Obama. Someday I’ll write a book,  I’ll do another book that will do successfully,” Trump said in  January 2016.', '  4. I’ll only answer that question at the “right time.”', '  “I’ll answer that question at the right time,” Trump said  mid-September 2016. “I just don’t want to answer it yet.”', '  5. The president was born in the United States. “Period.”', '  “President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period,”  Trump said after a lengthy press conference touting his new hotel  and veteran support.', '  6. She started it, I finished it by getting the birth  certificate.', 'In his dismissal of the conspiracy theory he’d championed, Trump  inaccurately claimed that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton  started the conspiracy theory.', '7. I only said it to “get on” with the campaign.', 'Asked what changed to prompt his reversal after nurturing a  conspiracy theory for five years, Trump said he acknowledged the  president’s birthplace to “get on with — I wanted to get on  with the campaign.”', '8. I didn’t say Obama was American because no one was asking.', 'Pressed in the first debate on September 26 on why Trump didn’t  lay the birther conspiracy to rest in the five years after Obama  released his long-form birth certificate, Trump falsely claimed  he didn’t publicly affirm his belief that Obama is an American  citizen because he wasn’t asked.', '“Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it,”  Trump said. “I figured you’d ask the question tonight, of course.  But nobody was caring much about it”', '9. Clinton should apologize, not me.', 'Trump inaccurately insisted, again, that Clinton’s campaign  started the rumor, and said she should apologize to the president  for it.', 'Current position: Trump said he believes Obama was born in the  United States because it is better for his campaign, but he  continues to inaccurately argue Clinton started the birther  movement — and that she should apologize for it.', '  VOTING FOR THE IRAQ WAR', '  1. Clinton voted for the war, so she has bad judgment.', 'Trump slammed Clinton in late June for her vote authorizing the  invasion of Iraq.', '“It all started with her bad judgment in supporting the War in  Iraq in the first place. Though I was not in government service,  I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes,  even before the war ever started,” he falsely stated in his June  22 speech. (There is no evidence he opposed the invasion, but  there is ample evidence that he supported it.)', '2. It doesn’t matter, people make mistakes.', 'Pressed on his running mate Pence’s vote for the Iraq war in an  interview on 60 Minutes, Trump said in July he didn’t “care”  because “it’s a long time ago, and he voted that way and they  were also misled.”', '“He’s entitled to make a mistake every once in a while,” Trump  declared, telling CBS’ Lesley Stahl of Clinton that “no, she’s  not” allowed to make a mistake herself.', 'Current position: It’s OK that Trump’s running mate voted for the  Iraq war, but it’s not OK that Clinton did.', '  2011 INTERVENTION IN LIBYA', '  1. The intervention in Libya by the U.S.-led coalition was a  terrible idea.', 'Asked in October 2015 if he felt the Middle East would be more  stable with Libyan dictator Muammar Gadhafi and Iraq’s  authoritarian leader Saddam Hussein still in power, Trump told  NBC News’ Chuck Todd, “Of course it would be. You wouldn’t have  had your Benghazi situation, which is one thing which was just a  terrible situation…But of course, it would. Libya is —  is not even — nobody even knows what’s goin’ on over there.  It’s not even a country anymore.”', 'A few weeks later, he was pressed again on CNN to say whether he  felt the two leaders of brutal regimes should have been left in  power.', '“100 percent,” Trump said. “I mean, look at Libya. Look at Iraq.  Iraq used to be no terrorists. [Hussein] would kill the  terrorists immediately, which is like now it’s the Harvard of  terrorism.”', 'He continued: “If you look at Iraq from years ago, I’m not saying  he was a nice guy, he was a horrible guy, but it was a lot better  than it is right now. Right now, Iraq is a training ground for  terrorists. Right now, Libya, nobody even knows Libya —  frankly, there is no Iraq and there is no Libya. It’s all broken  up. They have no control. Nobody knows what’s going on.”', '2. I’ve never offered a different opinion on Libya.', 'When then-rival Sen. Ted Cruz brought up Trump’s 2011 support for  the intervention, which Trump offered at the time via a video  blog, during a February debate, Trump denied having ever  supported Gadhafi’s ouster.', '“He said I was in favor in Libya,” he said. “I never discussed  that subject. I was in favor of Libya? We would be so much better  off if Gadhafi would be in charge right now.”', '3. I guess I did support an intervention.', 'When CBS actually played the video of Trump discussing the  subject — and supporting an intervention — in front of  Trump in early June 2016, Trump changed his mind and acknowledged  the past video.', '“That’s a big difference from what we’re talking about,” Trump  said. “I was for something, but I wasn’t for what we have right  now.”', '4. I wanted a surgical intervention, not a “strong” intervention.', 'When pressed during the CBS interview, Trump said he was for  “surgical” intervention, not a “strong intervention.”', '“I didn’t mind surgical. And I said surgical. You do a surgical  shot, and you take him out. But I wasn’t for what happened. Look  at the way - I mean, look at with Benghazi and with all of the  problems that we’ve had. It was handled horribly,” he said.', '“I think since then you’ve said you were never for intervention,  so it’s confusing,” CBS’s John Dickerson countered.', '“I was never for strong intervention. I could have seen surgical  where you take out Gadhafi and his group,” Trump responded.', '5. We really should have taken the oil in Libya, too, since we  were there.', 'In the first debate, Trump inaccurately claimed ISIS now controls  huge oil stores in Libya (they don’t) and that the U.S. should  have taken the oil after the intervention. (That would have  violated the Geneva Conventions.)', 'Current position: As Trump put it, “I was for something, but I  wasn’t for what we have right now.” That “something” seems to  include violating the Geneva Conventions to seize Libyan oil.', '  JAPAN AND NUKES', '  1. Japan should have nuclear weapons.', 'In March, Trump said the U.S. should reconsider its policy of not  allowing Japan to have nuclear weapons. He reiterated that view  in April.', '“It’s not like, gee whiz, nobody has them. So, North Korea has  nukes. Japan has a problem with that. I mean, they have a big  problem with that. Maybe they would in fact be better off if they  defend themselves from North Korea,” Trump said on Fox News in  April.', 'Host Chris Wallace followed up, asking, “With nukes?”', '“Including with nukes, yes, including with nukes,” Trump said.', '2. I never said that!', 'But at a Sacramento rally in June, Trump accused Clinton of lying  when she repeated his view as an example of his unfitness when it  comes to matters of national security.', 'Clinton “made a speech, she’s making another one tomorrow, and  they sent me a copy of the speech. And it was such lies about my  foreign policy, that they said I want Japan to get nuclear  weapons. Give me a break,” Trump said. “See they don’t say it: I  want Japan and Germany and Saudi Arabia and South Korea and many  of the NATO states, nations, they owe us tremendously, we’re  taking care of all those people and what I want them to do is pay  up.”', 'Current position: It’s unclear whether Trump would reverse U.S.  policy to allow Japan to have nuclear weapons, but it’s clear  Trump doesn’t like being reminded of the previous positions he  took.', '  MONEY IN POLITICS', '  1. Accepting donations means a candidate is controlled by special  interests.', 'Trump announced that he’d self-fund his campaign when he  announced his presidential bid. This, he said, time and time  again would help him better serve the country against the  corrupting force of money in politics.', '“By self-funding my campaign, I am not controlled by my donors,  special interests or lobbyists. I am only working for the people  of the U.S.!” he wrote in a September 5 Facebook post.', '2. People can donate to me as long as they don’t want anything in  return.', 'Despite the self-funding promise, the Trump campaign quietly sent  out fundraising emails, put a glossy donate option on its website  and raked in millions. Still, Trump insists, it’s about  investment in the campaign — not the cash itself.', '“I actually like the idea of investing in a campaign, but it has  to be no strings attached,” he said in a CBS interview.', '3. The Trump campaign will not fully self-fund.', 'Trump has said he won’t self-fund like he did in the primary.', '“I’ll be putting up money, but won’t be completely self-funding,”  he told the Wall Street Journal in a May 4 interview, noting that  he’s created a finance committee and will tap his base for money  going into the general election. He’s hired Steven Mnuchin, a  former Goldman Sachs partner who has a history of political  donations across both sides of the aisle, to head up the  committee.', 'This is a reversal, but only in rhetorical terms, since Trump  isn’t exactly self-funding his primary campaign, despite his loud  protestations to the contrary. PolitiFact dubs his claim “half  true” because Trump is pulling in big bucks from donors and most  of his own contributions are technically loans or in-kind  contributions, signaling that he may want to recoup those costs  eventually.', 'Current position: Political donations are fine when those  donations benefit the Trump campaign.', '  VIOLATING U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL LAWS WITH REGARD TO TORTURE,  TERRORISM', '  1. The military will obey potentially illegal orders.', 'In December, Trump started demanding that the US target the  families of ISIS members in addition to “bombing the sh*t” out of  the terrorist organization. He went further in February,  advocating for torture as a method of interrogation.', '“I would bring back waterboarding, and I’d bring back a hell of a  lot worse than waterboarding,” Trump declared in the February  debate just ahead of the New Hampshire primary. Calls for  bringing torture back became a regular applause line at rallies,  despite the likelihood that both of these ideas would require the  American military to obey orders that violate international laws  and federal anti-torture statutes.', 'Pressed at a debate on March 3 over whether the American military  would obey his order to violate international laws and the Geneva  Convention to do such things, Trump insisted they’d listen to  him, despite condemnation from military leaders and  conservatives.', '“Frankly, when I say they’ll do as I tell them, they’ll do as I  tell them,” he said.', '2. The military shouldn’t break the law, after all.', 'He then reversed this position the very next day, on March 4, in  a statement to the Wall Street Journal, saying he “will not order  military or other officials to violate those laws and will seek  their advice on such matters.”', '3. The laws forbidding torture should be changed so no one has to  break them.', 'Not long after terrorist attacks in Brussels killed at least 28  people and injured dozens more on March 22, Trump called in to  CNN to expand on his call to legalize waterboarding.', '“Look, I think we have to change our law on the waterboarding  thing, where they can chop off heads and drown people in cages,  in heavy steel cages and we can’t water board,” Trump told CNN’s  Wolf Blitzer. “We have to change our laws and we have to be able  to fight at least on almost equal basis.”', 'When Blitzer reminded Trump that military leaders don’t support  torture and that it violates international agreements that the  United States has signed, Trump called opposition to torture a  “political decision.”', '“I would say that the eggheads that came up with this  international law should turn on their television and watch CNN  right now, because I’m looking at scenes on CNN right now as I’m  speaking to you that are absolutely atrocious,” Trump said. “And  I would be willing to bet, when I am seeing all of the bodies  laying all over the floor, including young, beautiful children  laying dead on the floor, I would say if they watched that,  maybe, just maybe they’ll approve of waterboarding and other  things.”', 'Current position: Trump says he’s against violating international  laws or ordering others to do so, but wants to change the laws to  legalize, at minimum, waterboarding.', ' KU KLUX KLAN AND DAVID DUKE', '  1. ‘I disavow, OK?’', '  After former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard and white nationalist  David Duke began encouraging his followers to vote for the  Republican front-runner, including making a plea on his radio  show on February 25, Trump initially disavowed Duke’s support in  a press conference on February 26.', '  “I didn’t even know he endorsed me. David Duke endorsed me? OK,  all right. I disavow, OK?” Trump said.', '  2. ‘I don’t know anything about David Duke. OK?’', '  After disavowing David Duke on a Friday, Trump was asked about  the Ku Klux Klan and Duke by CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday. Trump  claimed to know nothing of Duke or the KKK.', '  “I don’t know anything about David Duke. OK? I don’t know  anything about what you’re even talking about with white  supremacy or white supremacists. So I don’t know. I don’t know,  did he endorse me or what’s going on, because, you know, I know  nothing about David Duke. I know nothing about white  supremacists. And so you’re asking me a question that I’m  supposed to be talking about people that I know nothing about,”  Trump said, refusing three times to unequivocally condemn the  support of white supremacists until he knew more about  them.', '  3. ‘I disavow, OK?’ — part two.', '  After that cagey song and dance-like interview sparked outrage,  Trump took to Twitter to clarify, tweeting a video of his Friday  press conference in which he did disavow Duke.', '  The next day on NBC’s “Today,” Trump blamed his refusal to  condemn Duke and the KKK on a lousy earpiece but continued to  hedge against disavowing the support of “groups” he doesn’t know  anything about, despite Savannah Guthrie’s reminder that in the  interview in question, Trump had been only been asked about the  KKK and Duke.', 'Current position: Trump has disavowed Duke, despite a lengthy  back-and-forth about whether he knows about him or not.', '  THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL', '  1. Keep the current deal with Iran, police it.', 'Trump was one of the few Republicans who didn’t immediately  promise to rip up the Iranian nuclear deal. The author of “The  Art of the Deal” told his supporters that while it was the worst  deal ever, they’d probably have to live with it.', '“It’s very hard to say, “We’re ripping it up.′ And the problem is  by the time I got in there, they will have already received the  $150 billion,” Trump said, referring to a high estimate of how  many of Iran’s assets will be unfrozen as part of the deal (the  White House says after Iran’s debts are paid, it’s closer to $56  billion).', '“But I will police that deal,” he said, touting his handling of  business contracts. “I would police that contract so tough that  they don’t have a chance. As bad as the contract is, I will be so  tough on that contract.”', '2. Renegotiate the nuclear deal with Iran.', 'In September, he went further.', '“When I am elected president, I will renegotiate with Iran —  right after I enable the immediate release of our American  prisoners and ask Congress to impose new sanctions that stop Iran  from having the ability to sponsor terrorism around the world,”  he wrote in an op-od for USA Today.', 'Current position: Renegotiate the deal.', '  HEALTH CARE', '  1. Repeal Obamacare. Look to Canada for inspiration.', 'In August, Trump was asked repeatedly if he still supported the  single-payer health care he’d touted in the past. He said America  should have a private system but repeatedly praised Canada and  Scotland’s socialized system.', '“As far as single-payer, it works in Canada. It works incredibly  well in Scotland. It could have worked in a different age, which  is the age you’re talking about here,” Trump said. “What I’d like  to see is a private system without the artificial lines around  every state … Get rid of the artificial lines, and you will  have yourself great plans. And then we have to take care of the  people that can’t take care of themselves. And I will do that  through a different system.”', '2. Repeal Obamacare. Cover everybody.', '“I am going to take care of everybody,” Trump told CBS in  September. “I don’t care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody’s  going to be taken care of much better than they’re taken care of  now.”', '3. Repeal Obamacare, but ‘I like the mandate’', 'During a CNN town hall on February 18, Trump started to answer a  question about how he’d replace the Affordable Care Act with  health savings accounts, “which are great,” but interrupted  himself to talk at length about how he’s “a self-funder.” When  pressed by interviewer Anderson Cooper about what would happen  when Obamacare is repealed and the mandate disappeared, therefore  allowing insurance companies to deny coverage to those with  pre-existing conditions, Trump said:', '“Well, I like the mandate. OK. So here’s where I’m a little bit  different. I don’t want people dying on the streets and I say  this all the time.”', '4. Repeal Obamacare. Replace it with something.', 'Trump was mocked in the February 25 debate for being vague about  how he would replace Obamacare.', '“You’ll have many different plans. You’ll have competition,  you’ll have so many different plans,” he said at the debate,  earning derision from Sen. Marco Rubio.', '5. Repeal Obamacare. Not everyone will be covered.', 'His health care plan, finally released online in March, has far  more in common with the kind of boilerplate health care proposals  the rest of the Republican party touts than his earlier praise  for Canada suggested it might.', 'It would likely cause 21 million people to lose their health  insurance and cost about $270 billion over 10 years, according to  the nonpartisan budget advocacy group Committee for a Responsible  Federal Budget (CRFB).', 'It offers up unspecified amounts of grants to states to replace  Medicaid, but it’s not clear how or what those would look like,  or how they would cover the millions of people that Trump’s plan  lets fall through the cracks. CRFB noted that block grants “could  generate a wide range of savings” to the federal budget, but  without details on them, it is “impossible to score any savings”  from his plan.', 'Current position: Repeal Obamacare. Replace it with something.', '  RIGGED ELECTION/POLITICAL SYSTEM', '  1. It’s rigged!', 'Locked in a heated primary battle with Ted Cruz, Trump began  alleging that the election was a “rigged, disgusting, dirty  system.”', '2. I won, so it’s OK.', '“You’ve been hearing me say it’s a rigged system, but now I don’t  say it anymore because I won. It’s true. Now I don’t care.

Be careful though, it’s still rigged.', '“Nov. 8, we’d better be careful, because that election is going  to be rigged,” he said August 1st in Ohio in a claim PolitiFact  rated ‘pants on fire’ wrong. “People are going to walk in and  they’re going to vote 10 times, maybe, who knows?”', '3. It’s rigged by the media.', 'With polls showing Trump trailing Clinton consistently, he  challenged the legitimacy of the election and the polls he once  championed.', '“The election is being rigged by corrupt media pushing completely  false allegations and outright lies in an effort to elect her  president,” Trump said October 15th.', '4. It’s rigged by voter fraud and the media!', '“The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and  distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary - but also at many  polling places - SAD,” he tweeted.', '5. Everything’s rigged!', '“When the people who control the political power in our society  can rig investigations like her investigation was rigged, can rig  polls, you see these phony polls, and rig the media, they can  wield absolute power over your life, your economy, and your  country, and benefit big time by it. They control what you hear  and what you don’t hear. What is covered, how it’s covered, even  if it’s covered at all,” Trump said at a Florida rally on October  24th.', '6. It might not be rigged', 'Once the FBI announced that they’d review additional emails  related to Clinton’s time as Secretary of State that were  obtained in a separate investigation, Trump told a crowd that  maybe the system wasn’t so rigged after all.', '“But with what I’ve just announced,” Trump said in New Hampshire.  “It might not be as rigged as I thought, right?

The company has said it could open as many as 20 to 30 Roastery stores around the world.', 'The New York location is just one of six Roasteries expected to be open before 2020. So far, Starbucks has locations in Seattle, Shanghai and Milan. Roasteries in Chicago and Tokyo are slated to open in 2019.', 'Each Roastery features unique art made just for the location.

These beans will be used in-store and will be shipped to other Starbucks locations to be used in beverages.', 'Starbucks tailors the design of each Roastery to the city that it is built within. As a nod to the historic meatpacking district, bags of green coffee beans will make their way from the cellar below via hooks on a conveyor belt on the ceiling, mimicking how a butchery would have operated in the area.', '“The meatpacking district has become this incredible place of food and taste,” Muller said. “We wanted an experience that meets and adds inspiration to this fantastic neighborhood. Something for people to do as they’re coming out of the subway or off the High Line or out of the Chelsea Market. Something to make people say, ‘wow.’”', 'There are several different bars throughout the Roastery that feature different types of brewing techniques including pour-over coffee in a Chemex coffee maker, siphon and cold brew.', 'At the experience bar located on the lower level, customers can watch as their barista craft items not found in other Starbucks cafes, like a Cardamon Latte or Nitro Apricot Cold Brew. This bar also allows customers to try out fights of espresso and compare how different brewing methods affect the taste of the coffee.', 'There are even several different ice cream beverages that diners can enjoy.', 'On the top level is the Arriviamo Bar, a 60-foot bar that seats around 80 people and features an assortment of traditional and unique cocktails.', 'Items on the menu mix Starbucks coffee and espresso as well as Teavana tea with spirits and flavors. For example, the Dear Lucania pairs Teavana’s Sencha Jade Green Tea with whiskey, amaro, acacia honey, lemon-orange cordial and lime.', '“Opening a bar with beautiful wine and drinks is one thing, but we’re taking what we know best, coffee and tea, and using that to elevate everything,” Muller said. “The unique drinks, the glassware – it will be an experience to open your palette and your mind to new tastes and combinations.”']"
89,Cramer Remix: Most contentious stock out there,2015-08-31T23:07:57+0000,"['  In a volatile market that has become a battleground, Jim Cramer  had a hard time finding a more contentious or divisive stock than  Intrexon, the leader of synthetic biology.', '  A synthetic biology company, Intrexon uses computers to develop  new DNA sequences that can then be put to work to create  biologically superior products for various end markets. This  includes not only drugs, but also food, energy and consumer  packaged goods.', '  But at the end of the day, Cramer thinks the story behind this  stock is all about trust. The bulls believe in Intrexon and its  CEO, billionaire healthcare investor Randall Kirk. The bears see  Intrexon as a cult of personality stock built around Kirk.', '  Given the long track record Kirk has for taking over drug  companies and selling them for big bucks, Cramer is willing to  believe in Intrexon. Just as Kirk sold New River Pharma to Share  for $2.6 billion in 2006, and sold Clinical Data for Forest Labs  for $1.2 billion in 2011, he could pull it off again.', '  “I think he deserves the benefit of the doubt here,” Cramer said.', '  However while there could be opportunity in Intrexon, Cramer  think it is best to only invest in this stock for speculation and  to not utilize any retirement funds for this stock.', 'Read More  Cramer: The Street fight over Intrexon ', '  Cramer has watched as investors continue to wait for the big  event or news that will send the market down gigantically, to  slay the bulls and finally bring in the bear. They have hung on  to every word from the Fed, waiting for the rate hike hammer to drop.', '  But what if it already happened?', '  After the market had the worst August in five years, Cramer can  only use that data to come to the conclusion that the bear market  has already arrived.', '  Cramer recently took a look at the ’s Daily Action Charts, and was  horrified at the level of destruction that has already taken  place. The chart book includes the largest stocks in the S&P  500, largest companies in the midcap index and a few others not  yet in the index. ', '  He began to count how many stocks had fallen hard this year, and  discovered that it filled up multiple pages. In total, there were  240 stocks in bear market territory as of Friday, and the number  was a lot larger if taken from Tuesday’s bottom.', '  “For many stocks, we are already discounting a pretty severe  recession. And if you include last Tuesday’s lows, I could argue  that most sectors have entered vicious bear markets,” Cramer  said.', '  Ultimately, when Cramer looked at stocks in the market he  realized that the rate hike is being built in every day that it  is down. There will certainly be repercussions when the Fed  tightens, but many have already been discounted by many of the  stocks that continue to be obliterated in this bear market.', 'Read More  Cramer: Big, bad rate hike built into stock prices', '  So while the market may have discounted stocks all over the  place, those discounts can sometimes create opportunities. This  was the case when Cramer looked at Ulta Salon, Cosmetics &  Fragrance, the nation’s largest beauty retailer with  approximately 800 stores across the country. Each store includes  a built-in salon where clients can also get a haircut or  highlights.', '  Last Thursday, Ulta reported a fantastic quarter. The stock  initially surged to $169 from $160 the next day, it ended up  closing down more than a dollar. On Monday it declined further,  even though the stock is still up 24 percent for the year.', '  “In my opinion it seems absurd that you are getting this  excellent quarter for free,” Cramer said.', '  To hear more about what could be in store for Ulta, Cramer spoke  with Ulta’s CEO Mary Dillon.', '  “Bottom line is guests are responding to what Ulta Beauty is  bringing to the marketplace, which is all things beauty all in  one place. What’s thrilling is that we are able to also invest in  our future growth at the same time to make sure we have a  long-term very sustainable proposition,” Dillon said.', '  With so many stocks in pain right now, could there possibly be  any stocks left in the market that could still work in an  investor portfolio? ', '  This has been the question on the minds of many investors lately  especially after the beating industrials, financials and tech  stocks have taken lately. That is why Cramer decided to dig  through last week’s rubble to find a few groups that could have  some life left in them.', '  “I think the selloff has gone on so long that we just accept  there are many ‘no-fly zone’ sectors that we just stopped paying  attention to months and months ago,” the “Mad Money” host said. (Tweet This)', '  Cramer’s favorite play lately has been on the uptrend in housing,  which touches anything that goes into a house and anywhere that  those goods are purchased—with exception of lumber. And now  that the Fed is going to raise rates, there could be  opportunity.', ' Home  Depot stock has risen, but Lowe’s is down despite the  excellent commentary from both companies regarding appliances.  Cramer also highlighted both Whirlpool and PPG as being down,  though they have substantial operations overseas away from their  domestic business.', '  There are also a few recession proof stocks that have stayed  strong. Constellation Brands and Electronic Arts have shown  people still love video games and booze. And Autozone and O’Reilly  Automotive are proof that auto parts are still needed now that  Americans are keeping their cars longer, regardless of what is  happening in the stock market.', '  Finally there are the tech stocks and FANG stocks, an acronym for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, along with a few peaked  cybersecurity stocks, Avago and Skyworks.', '  “This pastiche of winners allows us the illusion of a bull  running through this market. To me, though, the real takeaway is  that after last week, not even these stocks are safe,” Cramer  said.', ' Read More Cramer: A  few stocks still running with the bulls', '  With oil plunging to the mid $30s and then bouncing back to $49  on Monday, Cramer isn’t sure what to do with some of the energy  stocks.', '  That is why he turned to the top brass of Cheniere Energy to find out  what the future of energy could hold. Cheniere is a pioneer in  building liquefied natural gas export terminals that will be able  to ship an abundant amount of domestic natural gas to markets  overseas where it is more expensive. ', '  Has the carnage in oil finally hit a bottom, so the stock can  bounce back again?

And imports, while starting the year fairly strong, are sputtering.', '  The stats are from INTTRA, an outfit that can best be described  as an Orbitz or Expedia for businesses looking to move freight  across oceans. Its booking services cover 49 shipping lines representing  about 93 percent of the world’s ocean-going container space. In  conjunction with Cass Information Systems, a logistics number  cruncher (among other things), INTTRA recently put four years of its  booking data into index form, going back four years, and released it to the public.', '  “This gives us a global view of what’s happening in the freight  market,” said Sandra Moran, vice president of product and  industry marketing for INTTRA.', '  And what’s happening?', '  Export-wise things are looking up. There was a 7.3 percent rise  in container exports from the United States in October, following  a 9.9 percent drop in September, according to the report.', '  But don’t get too excited. Every month in 2013 posted lower  export levels than 2012. For just the month of October, container  exports were 9.2 percent below the same month in 2012, 19.2 below the 2011 level and 22.4 percent below 2010. ', '  The tale is a little better for imports. With the economy coming back, container imports picked up 14.2 percent over the summer. But  things slowed in September, posting a 4 percent drop, and  October showed an 8 percent drop in traffic.', '  (Related: Busiest U.S. trade hubs)', '  “I expect this decline to carry into the first quarter next year  because inventories are high,” said Wilson, who provides INTTRA  with commentary on the indexes. “We’re seeing  interest rates begin to change ... a new Fed chair, ... the cost of  holding inventory is going to get higher. They (businesses)  aren’t going to build them.”', '  Another, longer-lived, shipping index seems to be hinting at  the same thing.', '  Port throughput data for the U.S. East Coast and West Coast,  compiled by Drewry Maritime Research in London, also show some  recent weakness.', '  “It’s only one month so it’s difficult to call it just yet,”  Simon Heaney, consultant and research manager for containers for  Drewry, said via email. “However, you will have seen  that consumer confidence has dropped following the shutdown and  fears of a repeat next year, so it’s fair to say there are some  difficult headwinds.”', '  It is important to note these indexes are dealing with  containerized freight traffic as opposed to bulk cargo shipments,  like coal and wheat. So it may not be a complete picture of trade  between the United States and the rest of the world.  Nevertheless, it is estimated that over 90 percent of the world’s  nonbulk cargo travels by container.

91,"Apple killed its headphone plug, so a few companies are helping dig its grave",2016-09-10T20:00:00+0000,"['  This week, Apple killed the headphone jack on its iPhone 7,  meaning users may end up paying at least $160 for its new  wireless headphones. Yet a few vendors are quickly rising to the challenge of a brave new world untethered from wire-based headphones.', '  Already, several new headphones are making use of Apple’s  Lightning cable, rather than the classic audio port — but they  don’t come cheap. Some of these accessories often run upwards of  $150, while others cost more than the iPhone itself.', '  When it unveiled the iPhone 7 on Wednesday, Apple sent shockwaves  through the tech world by getting rid of the headphone jack and  pushing consumers to its Lightning port. That will now serve as  both charger and, for an additional cost, an adapter port for  those who still want to use wired headphones. ', '  However, the tech giant’s self-styled $159 AirPods, a basic set of  wireless ear pods compatible with the iPhone 7, lack certain  flair. For those who want more style and flair, there are plenty  of other options — the catch being price.', '  A few companies, including high-end audio manufacturer Audeze and  Danish audio equipment creator Libratone, are focusing on wired  options. Audeze’s EL-8 Titanium, which sells for a whopping $799,  was released in December 2015 — just before rumors surrounding  the new iPhone had surfaced. The company’s other Lightning-compatible model, Sine, costs $499. Audeze has also developed newer models priced at $399 and $599. Those will begin shipping  in late October.', '  When the company decided to build more consumer-friendly models  in addition to its professional grade headphones, it turned to  the Lightning connector in order to boost sound quality, Audeze  CEO Sankar Thiagasamudram explained to CNBC recently.  ', '  But will audiophiles really shell out that much money for  headphones? Thiagasamudram thinks so.', '  “The reason they are expensive is because of the type of  technology,” he told CNBC. “We are known for accuracy and quality  of the sound.”', '  He didn’t anticipate Apple eliminating the headphone jack, but  the recent news has certainly helped Audeze’s sales. The company  has been selling more Lightning-compatible headphones over the  last few months as rumors of the new iPhone circulated,  Thiagasamudram said, and traffic to Audeze’s website has  quadrupled. ', '  Libratone is also betting on customers valuing quality and unique  features more than price. The Danish company said pre-ordering  for its $179 Q Adapt in-ear headphones will begin in late  September. The headphones will ship in mid-October.', '  While interest in the company’s product has spiked since Apple’s  new iPhone announcement, Libratone President Mike Culver insists  the timing is coincidental.', '  “We started on this project over a year ago,” he told CNBC. “This  is not tied to the iPhone 7 launch at all. We would have done  this either way, regardless of whether they took out the  headphone jack.”', '  Either way, the company appears certain to benefit from Apple’s  dramatic shift away from the headphone jack. That’s because  Libratone uses the Lightning connector to provide greater power  for its new headphones, which offer adjustable noise cancellation — a feature that lets users decide how much external noise they  want to hear. ', '  This functionality requires a lot of power, Culver said. For  typical headphones, that would mean attaching a battery pack that  needs to be recharged. Using the Lightning port allows the  headphones to harness extra power without comprising a sleek  design.', '  Yet for those who don’t need the frills of noise cancellation or  professional-level sound quality, electronics and lighting  manufacturer Brightech provides a cheaper alternative. The  company has been selling Lightning-compatible headphones since  December 2015: Its in-ear option costs $49.99, while the  over-ear option costs $39.99.', '   “We’re looking for people that don’t have $300 to spend,  who need things but have to be able to afford it,” said Mark  Adelman, Brightech’s retail manager. He said the company  typically sells 20 to 50 Lightning-compatible headphones each  month. Since rumors about Apple eliminating the headphone jack  surfaced last week, they’ve seen a nearly threefold increase in  sales, he said.']"

Oil prices traded in a range until September, when they began a rally to four-year highs as traders braced for potential oil shortages following the sanctions.', '', 'Prices have since backed down to their lowest since April following a punishing October sell-off in global financial markets, weakening oil demand forecasts and increases in output from OPEC, the United States and Russia.', 'International benchmark Brent crude is up nearly 9 percent this year, while U.S. crude has risen more than 4 percent. Higher crude costs have heaped financial pain on oil importing countries with weakening currencies, including India, Argentina and Turkey.', 'Mnuchin said the list of blocked entities will total roughly 700 when the final sanctions information is released on Monday. That includes hundreds that were granted sanctions relief under the 2015 nuclear deal, as well as roughly 300 additional entities.', 'The Treasury secretary also sought to clarify the U.S. position on SWIFT, the financial messaging system that facilitates transactions around the world.', 'Mnuchin said SWIFT could be subject to sanctions if the system facilitates transactions for designated Iranian financial institutions. The United States is telling SWIFT to disconnect any of those designated institutions as soon as possible, he added.', 'The SWIFT system will be allowed to facilitate transactions with non-designated entities for certain humanitarian goods like medicine and food, Mnuchin said. However, he warned that the United States would sanction banks that facilitate illicit transactions masquerading as humanitarian trade.']"

Adam Smith, Democrat of Washington, said in comments last week in support of the study of new base closures.', 'Earlier this year, Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain, Republican of Arizona, called member hesitation to revisit base closings “cowardice” because he believes it provides money being wasted that could go to more pressing defense needs.', 'A Pentagon study from 2016 warned there is “significant excess capacity” in the nation’s military infrastructure and urged Congress to take action to generate savings.

Jack Reed, ranking member of the committee, also signed on to the McCain effort, but it’s unclear whether there’s broad support in the chamber for another round of base closures.', 'Pentagon officials have said a new BRAC round, once completed, could capture savings of approximately $20 billion over 10 years.', '“The bottom line is that Congress refusing to allow a BRAC is forcing the military to spend money that it doesn’t want to spend and doesn’t need to spend,” said Christopher Preble, vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, a Washington think-tank.', 'Preble said a new BRAC round wouldn’t mean denying the military land it might need in the future, but said it’s about “rationalizing what properties they have and what they need.”', 'When including all five of the previous BRAC rounds since the 1980s, there have been annual savings estimated at more than $12 billion – and nearly $5 billion alone from the last one in 2005.', 'Money savings from a new round of BRAC would be enough to buy 22 F-18 Hornet fighter jets or four Virginia-class submarines, according to McClintock. It also could buy another large batch of F-35 stealth fighters. ', '“BRAC reduces fixed costs they would have with infrastructure,” said Frederico Bartels, policy analyst for defense budgeting at the Heritage Foundation, a Washington think tank. “That is the only way at getting at those fixed costs because there are a long of congressional limitations placed on what DoD can do with its physical infrastructure.”', 'Heritage Foundation supports a new round of BRAC to “right-size” the DOD infrastructure, saying it would allow the Pentagon to do “a rigorous and transparent review of its current and future infrastructure needs, including closing bases and facilities as appropriate.” Even so, the conservative think tank also believes “some excess infrastructure may be worth keeping, as a hedge against future needs.”', 'Some of the opposition for another round of base closures comes from lawmakers who say the costs of consolidation are too high and that local communities depend on these bases for their livelihood.', 'Mandy Smithberger, director of the Straus Military Reform Project at the Project on Government Oversight, said the federal government usually helps communities adjust to base closures. She also said a U.S. Government Accountability Office study found that communities closed under the last BRAC round in 2005 actually did better under the Great Recession than average communities across the country.', '“There are ways to have soft landings,” said Smithberger.', 'However, there are others who suggest a new round of BRAC should wait until President Donald Trump completes his plans to expand the military, including his stated goal to add more troops.', 'Also, some congressional critics of the BRAC program maintain that the 2005 consolidation ended up having savings below original expectations.', 'The 2005 BRAC was advertised originally by the Pentagon of having an implementation cost of about $21 billion, but that number grew to about $35.1 billion, largely reflecting cost overruns from construction costs. It impacted 24 facilities nationally and resulted in the relocation of around 125,000 people, including troops, their families and civilian employees.', 'Even though the last BRAC round did turn out to be perhaps more expensive than expected, proponents of the process say it wasn’t entirely a base closure program but was a realignment of large facilities. There also were several projects related to support the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, including training and operations support.', 'Cato’s Preble said resistance in Congress to another BRAC comes from a misconception that when a military base closes it always means bad news for local communities and that they can’t bounce back.', '“There’s’ a lot of resistance on Capitol Hill, unfortunately. There’s a belief that when a base closes it has a devastating impact on the surrounding communities. And my research shows that that’s not actually the case.”', 'Added Preble: “In most cases, the surrounding community finds a way to redirect those resources to more productive ends and they end up – sometimes quite quickly – with a much more diverse economic base. They have a stronger workforce, better pay, and are less dependent on a single source.”', 'As an example, he said when Philadelphia’s Naval Shipyard closed in the 1990s it was “a grim time and people were pretty pessimistic.” But he said the area bounced back and today is “just unbelievable” with a business building commercial ships and private businesses and retail establishments.', 'He also cited the success following the closure of Naval Air Station Brunswick in Maine, part of the 2005 BRAC round. The facility was turned over to civilian use and attracted new companies and development, adding significant property tax revenue for local communities and new jobs. Likewise, Austin’s Bergstrom Air Force Base, located seven miles outside downtown, was closed and later converted to a commercial airport serving the growing community.', '“The Austin airport is now a huge, modern airport that Austin was desperate to build for a long, long time,” said Preble. “The closure of the Air Force base, in many respects, solved a critical problem for the city.”']"
95,Michael Kors is fed up with department stores damaging its brand,2016-08-10T15:43:13+0000,"[' Michael Kors has  had enough with department stores’ excessive discounting.', '  After reporting a 7 percent decline in its wholesale business  during the fiscal first quarter, CEO John Idol told analysts that  come February, the accessories brand will no longer participate  in department stores’ broad-based friends and family sales, or  accept coupons for its products there. ', '  The label will also move forward with its strategy to cut back on  the amount of merchandise it ships to these retailers, as it  looks to rebuild the pricing power it’s lost with shoppers.  Because the brand is constantly on sale, consumers have forgotten  the true value of the product, Idol said. ', '  These discounts once again damaged its revenue and profit margins  in both wholesale and stand-alone stores, Idol added. Michael  Kors’ same-store sales slid 7.4 percent during the fiscal first  quarter, steeper than Retail Metrics’ forecast for a 4.2 percent  decline.', '  “It’s creating confusion in the consumers’ mind relative to the  value of the Michael Kors brand when it’s being seen so often on  sale in so many different places,” Idol said. “We have to correct  something that we think is actually having a negative long-term  effect for the brand.” ', '  Because of this pullback, Idol told investors they should expect  to see further degradation at department stores for the remainder  of the year and into 2017. The company has already started  dialing back the number of goods it sends to department stores, a  strategy it had previously announced. ', '  Kors’ comments come just one day after competitor Coach said that it  will exit about  25 percent of the 1,000 department stores where it sells its  product. Like Kors, Coach is trying to regain control over the  prices charged for its handbags. Unlike Coach, Kors will not pull  its brand from any locations. ', '  Michael Kors’ products are sold at retailers  including Nordstrom and Bloomingdale’s. Macy’s generates the largest  chunk of its wholesale revenue and accounted for 12.7 percent of  its total sales last year.', '  The company reported fiscal first-quarter earnings of 88 cents a share on revenue of  $987.9 million. That compares with 87 cents a share and $986  million in sales during the prior-year period. Analysts had been  expecting the company to report earnings per share of 74 cents on  revenue of $953 million, according to Thomson Reuters  estimates.', 'Also hurting Kors during the quarter was a slowdown in travelers  visiting the United States, with sales in tourist-dependent  cities including New York getting hit particularly hard.  Shoppers’ preference for smaller handbags, which carry a lower  price tag, once again weighed on the company’s sales.', '  Still, management maintained its full-year guidance for revenue and earnings per share, saying it expects growth in its men’s,  digital and international businesses to offset the decline at  department stores. The label will likewise launch smartwatches  and smart jewelry in September, which management said should  moderate some of the slide it’s experienced in its watch  business. That was the brand’s weakest-performing category in the  quarter, posting a double-digit sales decline.', '  For the full year, management expects revenue to come in flat,  at roughly $4.7 billion, with earnings per share between $4.56  and $4.64. The company did, however, lower its outlook for  comparable sales. It now expects this metric to decline in a  mid-single-digit range, versus its prior guidance for a  low-single-digit drop. Its fiscal second-quarter earnings per share  guidance likewise fell short of Wall Street’s expectations.', '  “I don’t want you to think that we don’t understand there will be  a decline in certain categories because of this,” Idol said. “We  absolutely understand that and quite frankly want that because we  want to ship less units at lower prices ... that is not the way  ultimately to build a luxury business.”', '  Instead, the company plans to sell fewer units at higher prices  — something Idol said should, over time, balance out on  its top line.', '  Investors weren’t quite as convinced. Shares of Michael Kors were lower Wednesday, even after the wholesale  category posted a much narrower decline than analysts had  expected. Michael Kors’ reliance on department stores, where it  generated 40 percent of its sales during the quarter, has been  one of the biggest concerns among bearish investors.', '  “We continue to believe the brand is overdistributed, and while  the company is doing the right thing by reducing exposure to the  wholesale channel, we believe much of the damage has been done,”  Citi analyst Paul Lejuez said.']"

On Wednesday, he called the Fed “crazy” for continuing to raise interest rates.', 'While Cramer didn’t exactly support the president making those remarks, he did agree with him.', '“I agree with President Trump that the Fed needs to tighten less aggressively, even as he probably shouldn’t have said those nasty things in public because he’s making it harder, not easier, for Jerome Powell to give him what he wants,” he said. “When you look at the economy empirically right now, you start to see real problems.”', 'Looking industry by industry, Cramer started to see signs of different markets unraveling.', 'Sources within the auto industry, in addition to major suppliers PPG Industries and Trinseo, have suggested to the “Mad Money” host that there is a “definitive slowdown” in auto sales.', '“Housing is either pausing or down for the count,” he said. “We know this because it’s what Lennar, the largest homebuilder in America, told us. Lennar has its pulse on every market.”', 'Key economic building blocks — things like packing materials and plastic — are either stagnant or dropping in price, indicating a slowdown in shipping, a leading barometer for the state of the economy, Cramer said.', 'Worse, oil and steel prices are rising, squeezing margins in the transportation and construction industries, he continued. ', '“When you consider all of these industries that have been slowing, ... you start to see some patterns,” Cramer told investors. “The Fed is thinking about how things are right now — or, more accurately, how they were last month. I’m more concerned about where they’re going to be, and it’s not a positive direction.”', 'To Cramer, the Fed’s best bet would be to raise interest rates one more time, if that’s even necessary, then ease and inspect the data before proceeding.', '“Unfortunately, the Fed’s using a snapshot to gauge the strength of the economy rather than getting its hands dirty by doing some homework,” he said. “By the way, as someone who wants stocks to go higher, ... it would be great if the White House actually acknowledged some of this weakness. You can’t say the economy’s great, but also the Fed shouldn’t tighten. It’s got to be one or the other.”', '“I’m not saying that the Fed’s gone crazy, that it’s gone loco. I don’t think it’s gone crazy at all. I think it’s gone lazy. It’s a shame,” the “Mad Money” host concluded. “I would like to be positive, but I have to settle for being constructive, and my empirical work says that I can’t be sanguine until everyone knows what I know and just told you.

It is not a natural monopoly. “Can prices ever be ‘too low’?” the Federal Trade Commission asks on its website. “The short answer is yes, but not very often.”', ' On its webpage about predatory pricing, the agency explains how the government thinks about competition. “A firm’s independent decision to reduce prices to a level below its own costs does not necessarily injure competition, and, in fact, may simply reflect particularly vigorous competition.”', 'That may be true. But in Amazon’s case, it has the potential to become so dominant in so many areas that its impact could be more than simply lowering prices for consumers; it could put large companies out of business.', 'Were that to happen, this new breed of Silicon Valley conglomerates may become more powerful — and resilient — than the 20th-century conglomerates of yore.', 'If Amazon were to use its acquisition of Whole Foods, along with the profits from its other businesses, to lower prices so much that it put out of business a company like Walmart, with its 1.5 million United States employees, would that be a good outcome? Or is that just a natural part of capitalism?', 'The view of Amazon’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is clear.

Held up for years by the Obama administration, the pipeline is planned to take oil from the Canadian sands in Alberta down to Steele City, Neb., where it could then head either to the Gulf Coast or Midwest refineries.', '“No surprise here on the Keystone decision. It was clearly going to be reversed. The decision not to build Keystone by the Obama Administration was never really about Keystone. The State Department, in reviewing it, had indicated that it would have no impact on carbon emissions. Rather, the Obama decision was about symbolism and the Paris climate conference,” said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit.', 'Yergin said the question now is how much oil from the Canadian sands will be shipped by rail and how much by pipeline, once the Keystone is built.', '“It does on the margin allow more of that heavy crude to make it to the refineries, which is a a positive, or be exported,” said Bart Melek, head of commodities strategy at TD Securities. “Really we’re just talking incremental here. It’s not really moving the needle either way. It just assures some of the plans to expend the sands continues and we don’t have to use trains. They’re expensive, and it’s not an efficient way to move crude.”', 'The Canadian sands, including upgraded synthetic crude, is expected to expand production to 5.3 million barrels a day by 2022, from 4.5 million barrels a day in 2016, according to the International Energy Agency. Canada also plans to increase pipeline capacity with the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain Expansion, which would take crude across Western Canada to British Columbia, for export to Asia. That project was approved by the Canadian government but is still pending local approval.', 'The sands has made gains in carbon emissions, though it is considered a dirtier source of crude, Yergin said. The cost per barrel is also higher than that of U.S. shale. But the additional oil would easily find a place in the world market, analyst say.', 'The heavy oil could displace oil that comes from other places outside the U.S., like Saudi Arabia or Iraq. Some heavy crude suppliers have seen waning production in recent years, like Mexico and Venezuela.', '“If we get additional quantities of heavy Canadian crude, which is preferred by many refineries in the U.S., we might turn out to sell more quantities of [U.S.] light, sweet crude to the rest of the world,” said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates.', 'The Gulf Coast refineries mainly refine heavy crudes, whereas U.S. shale drillers pump light, sweet crude. Light, sweet crude is mainly refined on the east and west coasts.', '“All this additional crude oil should keep our input costs lower, which will make our refined products even more competitive,” said John Kilduff of Again Capital. The U.S. is a net exporter of refined product already. Government data shows that the U.S. last week exported 1.2 million barrels a day of distillates, which includes fuels like diesel. The U.S. also exported 592,000 barrels a day of gasoline last week.', 'The U.S. exported an average 520,000 million barrels a day of oil last year, and much of that goes to Canada for refininig.

It’s cheaper to use a pipeline than rail or truck. Their break-even just got lowered, and their economic incentive just improved. One thing you can say is that over the last 10 years, the North American E and P producer knows how to respond to economic signals. If there’s a dollar to be made, they’re going to get at how to make it. The Keystone pipleline will certainly give them the opportunity to make a buck,” Cooper said.', 'Cooper also said exports from the U.S. could increase, whether it is Canadian oil directly, or more U.S. crude or refined product.

His restaurant, like many other  businesses in Williston, has had to cut wages. He says workers  who aren’t tied to Williston are leaving. Without the high  paychecks to keep them rooted, and a national economy that’s  better than it was a few years ago, many out-of-state workers are  leaving to find jobs closer to home.', '  “Since we opened this restaurant three years ago, 32 restaurants  have opened up,” said Jundt. “There are too many restaurants for  the number of people we have. But I think you can say that about  gas stations, apartment buildings, houses. Almost everything in  town is overbuilt.”', '  Hotels have also seen business decline. In January, the city’s  occupancy rate fell to 27 percent, compared with 62 percent in  2015.

113,How aluminum became a cash cow for Goldman,2014-06-03T17:42:51+0000,"[' A book hitting the stores Tuesday by CNBC’s Kate Kelly takes  a look inside the powerful group that runs the global commodities  trade. The following is an excerpt.', '  During the summer of 2011, officials at the London Metal Exchange  got an unexpected complaint from The  Coca-Cola Company. The amount of physical aluminum in storage  was piling up, said a representative of the soda maker, and,  along with it, so was the expense of buying the metal for  beverage containers.', '  The culprit, as Coke saw it, wasn’t simple supply and  demand—in fact, there was plenty of aluminum sitting in  warehouses. It was the shrewd tactics of Goldman Sachs, the bank that owned a network of  metal-storage facilities in the Detroit vicinity, where waiting  times for extracting aluminum were longer than ever. Every day  those metal bars sat idle, Goldman’s warehouse company  effectively drove up the premium amount that aluminum producers  could charge for delivering supplies to beverage-packaging  factories, a cost that amplified the expense of the actual metal  and, thus, the prices Coke and others paid for soda cans.', '  “The situation has been organized artificially to drive premiums  up,” said Dave Smith, Coke’s head of strategic procurement, at an  industry conference that June. “It takes two weeks to put  aluminum in, and six months to get it out.”', '  Coke wasn’t alone in its frustration. More than a year earlier,  eight players had complained privately to the LME, the obscure  London metals bourse that set the benchmark price for aluminum,  zinc, copper, and other important nonprecious, or base, metals  that were key in manufacturing. The U.S. warehousing system that  the exchange oversaw was so inefficient that it was hurting  corporate profits, they had argued.', '  The Midwest premium, the regional U.S. rate for getting metal  from a seller to a buyer, was a cost imposed on Coke and other  manufacturers in addition to the cash, or spot price of aluminum,  which was by then bouncing back from its lowest levels in some  time. Aluminum prices had increased 13 percent since the  beginning of 2010, when Goldman had paid half a billion dollars  to acquire Metro International Trade Services, the metal storage  business it now owned in Romulus, Michigan. Bought relatively  cheap at a time when commodity prices were low, Goldman took on  Metro as a way to broaden its suite of physical commodity  holdings, which had become an important complement to its  derivatives trading in London and the U.S. ', '  In addition to the revenue Metro offered, it presented Goldman  with the possibility of a free look at what was happening on the  physical side of commodities through ground-level operations.  Tweaking existing contract trades in a commodity based on  feedback from colleagues who worked in the physical markets was  by then commonplace in banking. “We had pipeline capacity all  over the place and we would call up and say, ‘How’s gas flowing  this morning?’” remembers a trading manager who worked for years  at one of Goldman’s competitors. If flows were weak, he added,  “We’d go, ‘Oh, we’re not going to get the pop we thought, so  let’s reposition.’ ” Still, Goldman spokespeople consistently  denied that employees familiar with Metro’s business operations  shared information about it with internal traders.', '  Goldman wasn’t the only one dipping into the physical commodity  world, a cornerstone of companies like Glencore International,  the Swiss trading firm originally known as Marc Rich & Co.,  that considered owning hard assets to be a critical aspect of  trading commodities. JPMorgan had recently bought a metal-storage  firm called Henry Bath & Son, among other physical assets.  Broadly speaking, the bet was that metal traders would stock up  on physical product while prices were relatively low and hold  their stocks until the market improved, generating steady rental  incomes for the warehouse owners in the process.', '  The new metal-warehouse owners quickly proved right—and had  huge stacks of metal bars to prove it. The nine hundred thousand  tons of aluminum Metro stored in its Detroit facilities when  Goldman bought it in 2010 were growing daily. Meanwhile,  incentive fees Metro paid to hedge funds, physical commodity  traders and other tenants—usually one or two hundred dollars  per ton each year—encouraged them to leave the metal there  for longer periods. ', '  For Goldman Sachs’s president, Gary Cohn, the aluminum  warehousing trade was a bit of déjà vu. Two decades  before, in the early 1990s, he had moved to London to help expand  Goldman’s commodities business, a onetime New Orleans coffee  trader that was known as J. Aron & Company. While in London,  Cohn stumbled upon a lucrative aluminum trade that involved  storing huge amounts of the metal until prices in the market  allowed him to sell at a profit.', '  Aluminum, which was a popular futures contract to trade, was at  the time in deep contango, a situation in which its future price  was far higher than its cash price. This meant that investors in  the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index — the commodities version  of the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, which had exposure  to aluminum and other major futures contracts—were  constantly paying extra money simply to maintain their aluminum  exposure as they replaced their existing near-term contracts with  new ones each month.', '  But every futures contract had an expiration date, and as that  date neared, its holder had a choice: either take physical delivery of  the aluminum, or roll the contract forward and replace it with a  similar futures contract dated farther out.', '  Cohn realized it would be cheaper to take delivery of the  aluminum than roll a futures contract forward. But doing so would  mean breaking a long-held tradition of leaving the logistics of  transporting bars of metal and barrels of oil to the  professionals who actually used them. Sourcing and shipping a  commodity like crude oil was elaborate enough that many futures  traders would never bother with it. And storing metal until  somebody else wanted to turn it into cans or cars was also a  highly nuanced endeavor with its own rulebook.', '  Cohn dove into the world of metal storage and financing, visiting  warehouses and researching metal insurance. “I spent a month sort  of due-diligencing a trade that took me thirty seconds to figure  out,” he says.', '  Convinced of the potential profits, he took the idea to one of J.  Aron’s senior managers, Lloyd Blankfein. Blankfein, a former gold  salesman, was dubious.', '  Cohn was insistent. He had thought through every issue, he told  Blankfein, and this was a “riskless” opportunity. Cohn would  hedge every potential problem he could find—interest rate  movements, currency movements, anything that could hurt the  trade’s performance—and would definitely make money.  Blankfein told him to run an experiment using no more than $300  million, a substantial portion of the firm’s $4 billion in  capital during that period.', '  The following Monday, Cohn bought $100 million worth of physical  aluminum—about a hundred thousand tons. Even with all the  homework he had done, and despite his boasts to Blankfein, he  honestly expected the potential profits to vanish as a result of  a sudden physical price drop, a surprise hike in storage fees, or  some other unforeseen complication. But the following day,  nothing had changed much, so he bought another $100 million of the metal. The next day, he bought another $50 million. By Friday,  when the spread, or difference between what he would have spent  to roll the contract forward and what he was actually spending to  store the metal, was still intact, he knew he was on to something.', '  Cohn continued taking physical delivery of aluminum, stockpiling  it in storage facilities in the Dutch city of Rotterdam. He also  began calling the firm’s aluminum-producer clients, seeing if  they wanted to sell down their physical inventories; many were  happy to oblige. Goldman Sachs was relieving them of excess metal  and helping them to free up cash without tipping off the rest of  the market. Meanwhile, its physical aluminum holdings offset the  futures it sold in the markets, giving Goldman what amounted to a  neutral position.', '  For more than two years, Goldman built enormous caches of  aluminum. Its hoard helped prompt the biggest aluminum price  rally the market had seen since 1988. During the years when Cohn  was purchasing the commodity, physical market prices nearly  doubled—amplifying the value of J. Aron’s stockpiles and  creating over half a billion dollars in profit to Goldman over  several years.', '  Late in 1994, a few months after his thirty-fourth birthday, Cohn  made partner, joining the ruling 2 percent echelon of a  9,600-employee firm. Around the same time, he also received a  strange complaint: the metal masses in Rotterdam had grown so  extensive that their reflection of the sun was creating confusion  for local air-traffic controllers. Airport officials asked  Goldman if it could throw a tarp over its aluminum stash to make  navigating the local skies a little easier.', '  By 2010 Metro, the metal-storage business Goldman had bought, was  storing one to two million tons of aluminum, zinc, and lead in  its Detroit corridor, and had leases with about two dozen  clients. But, thanks to the restrictive LME rules and the  market’s growing penchant for storing metal stocks, Metro’s  rental fees—about 40 cents per metric ton per day—were  generating more than $100 million in revenue each year.', '  When Coke, a longtime investment-banking client that had recently  hired Goldman to advise it on a $12 billion acquisition,  initially complained about the escalating storage costs of  aluminum and slow delivery times, the firm tried to assuage its  concerns. The trouble was the LME system, Goldman argued, which  was inefficient and needed updating. Goldman itself was simply  following the rules.', '  Truthfully, shipping out even the required amount of aluminum per  day was a huge undertaking. One day in September 2012, a few  months after the LME had raised minimum removal mandates, the  eighteen Metro workers in the company’s Chesterfield, Mich. plant  were very busy. Train boxcars sat with their doors open on the  tracks that ran inside the building as workers loaded slabs of  metal into them. Because the aluminum was so heavy, the stacks in  each car were surprisingly low, filling up only a fraction of the  space. Beeping forklifts breezed by as drivers picked up the bars  specified by individual warrants, or certificates of ownership,  for metal holders who wanted their wares transferred.', '  Rental fees had risen by that point to about 45 cents per ton per  day, generating some $200 million per year in revenue on Detroit  aluminum stores alone. Nonetheless, the premiums at work in the  Midwest market made the ownership lucrative, explained a Metro  executive, especially when aluminum markets were in contango.', '  “The ownership of metal is a control game,” he said, adding that  the markets were easy to squeeze because there were so few units  in circulation. Metro’s typical customer was a hedge fund, the  executive said, that bought physical aluminum from a producer  like Alcoa, shorted it through the futures markets as it was  being shipped to the warehouse, and then took ownership of the  warrants on the aluminum once they arrived in Detroit. Then the  aluminum-owning hedge fund could sell its warrant to another  party, who might wait for aluminum spot prices to rise, locking  in a profit.', '  The LME’s increased removal rate had done little to assuage Coke  and other aluminum users. Premiums had gone from about 6.5 cents  in 2010 to 11 cents by then, and would rise to a record of nearly  12 cents by the summer of 2013.', '  As the premium prices rose, Goldman and the LME were sued for  violating U.S. antitrust laws in the Detroit warehouses. A  parallel Justice Department inquiry was soon under way.', ' Excerpted from “The Secret Club That Runs the World: Inside  the Fraternity of Commodity Traders,” to be published in June  2014 by Portfolio, a member of Penguin Group (USA) LLC.

I’m making this presentation directly to the American people with the media present, which, it’s an honor to have you this morning because many of our nation’s reporters and folks will not tell you the truth and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve. And I hope going forward we can be a little bit different, and maybe get along a little bit better, if that’s possible. Maybe it’s not and that’s OK too. Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, DC, along with New York, Los Angeles, in particular, speaks not for the people, but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system.', 'The press has become so dishonest that if we don’t talk about it, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people.

I am talking, and really talking, on this very entrenched power structure and what we’re doing is we’re talking about the power structure. We’re talking about its entrenchment. As a result, the media’s going through what they have to go through to oftentimes distort — not all the time — and some of the media’s fantastic, I have to say, honest and fantastic — but much of it is not.

We have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, who has totally taken advantage of our previous administration. And they are the world’s top sponsor of terrorism. And we’re not going to stop until that problem is properly solved, and it’s not now. It’s one of the worst agreements I’ve ever seen drawn by anybody. I’ve ordered plans to begin for the massive rebuilding of the United States military.', 'I’ve had great support from the Senate. I’ve had great support from Congress, generally. We’ve pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military. I will tell you, that is my — I would be so happy if we never had to use it, but our country will never have had a military like the military we’re about to build and rebuild. We have the greatest people on earth in our military.', 'They don’t have the right equipment, and their equipment is old. I used it. I talked about it. At every stop. Depleted. It’s depleted. It won’t be depleted for long. One of the reasons I’m standing here instead of other people is, frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military. We have to have strong law enforcement also.', 'So we do not go abroad in the search of war. We really are searching for peace. It’s peace through strength. At home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the government to the people to a scale not seen in many, many years. In each of these actions, I’m keeping my promises to the American people. These are campaign promises. Some people are so surprised that we are having strong borders. Well that’s what I’ve been talking about for a year and a half, strong borders. They are so surprised. Oh, he is having strong borders. Well, that’s what I’ve been talking about to the press and everybody else.', 'One promise after another after years of politicians lying to you to get elected. They lied to the American people In order to get elected. Some of the things I’m doing probably aren’t popular, but they’re necessary for security and or other reasons. And then coming to Washington and pursuing their own interests, which is more important to many politicians.', 'I’m here following through on what I pledged to do. That’s all I’m doing. I put it out before the American people, got 306 electoral college votes. I wasn’t supposed to get 222. They said there’s no way to get 222. 230 is impossible. 270, which you need — that was laughable. We got 306. Because people came out and voted like they have never seen before. So that’s how it goes. I guess it was the biggest electoral college win since Ronald Reagan. In other words, the media is trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made, and they are not happy about it for whatever reason. And, but a lot of people are happy about it. In fact, I’ll be in Melbourne, Florida, at 5 on Saturday, and I heard, just heard the crowds are massive that want to be there. I turn on the TV, open the newspaper and I see stories of chaos. Chaos. Yet it is the exact opposite.', 'This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine. Despite the fact that I can’t get my Cabinet approved. They are outstanding people. Like Senator Dan Coats, who is there, one of the most respected men in the Senate. He can’t get approved. How do you not approve him? He’s been a colleague, highly respected, brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it, but were waiting for approval.', 'So we have a wonderful group of people that’s working very hard, that’s being very much misrepresented about, and we can’t let that happen.', 'So if the Democrats. all you have to do is look where they are right now. The only thing they can do is delay because they screwed things up royally. Believe me. Let me list things we’ve done in just a short period of time.', 'Just got here. I got here with no Cabinet. Again, each of the actions is a promise I made to the American people, going over just some of them. We have a lot in the next week and weeks coming. We have withdrawn from the job killing disaster known as Trans-Pacific Partnership. We’re going to have trade deals but we’re going to have one-on-one deals, bilateral. One-on-one deals.', 'We directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing and called for expedited approval of the permits needed for America and American infrastructure, meaning plants, equipment, roads, bridges, factories. People take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory. They go in for a permit, it’s many, many years, and at the end of the process, they spend tens of millions of dollars on nonsense, and at the end of the process, they are rejected. They may be rejected with me, but it’s going to be a quick rejection. Not going to take years, but, mostly, it’s acceptance. We want plants and factories built. We want the jobs. We don’t want the jobs going to other countries.', 'We’ve imposed a hiring freeze on nonessential federal workers. We’ve imposed a temporary moratorium and new federal regulations. We issued a game-changing new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. Makes sense. Nobody’s ever seen regulations like we have.', 'You go to other countries, and you look at industries they have, and you say, let me see your regulations. They are a fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have. I want regulations because I want safety. I want environmental, all environmental situations to be taken properly care of. It’s very important to me. You don’t need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing.', 'We’ve stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence. We’ve directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation — take a look at Chicago and others — taking place right now in our inner cities. Horrible. We’ve ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs. We’re becoming a drug-infested nation. Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars. We’re not going to let it happen any longer. We’ve undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our nation and our tax dollars safe and are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border.', '[I] met with general, now Secretary Kelly, yesterday, and we’re starting that process. And the wall is going to be a great wall, and it’s going to be a wall negotiated by me. The price is going to come down, just like on everything else I’ve negotiated for the government. And we’re going to have a wall that works. We’re not going to have a wall like they have now that is either nonexistent or a joke. We ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we’ve ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border. No more release. No matter who you are.', 'We’ve begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers, and others who pose a threat to public safety. We are saving American lives every single day. Court system has not made it easy for us. And we’ve even created a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of illegal immigrant violence, which there are many. We’ve taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. Though parts of our necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by judges, in my opinion, incorrect, an unsafe ruling.', 'Our administration is working night and day to keep you safe — including reporters — and is vigorously defending this lawful order. I will not back down from defending our country. I got elected on defending our country. I keep my campaign promises, and our citizens will be very happy when they see the result, they already are. I can tell you that. Extreme vetting will be put in place, and it already is in place in many places. In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number. I’ve heard 80 percent, I find that hard believe. That’s just a number I heard, that they are overturned 80 percent of the time. I think that circuit is — that circuit in chaos and that circuit is frankly in turmoil.', 'But we are appealing that and we are going further. We’re issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country, so we’ll be going along the one path and hopefully winning that. At the same time we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people and that’ll be done sometime next week in the beginning or middle at the latest part.', 'We’ve also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone pipeline and Dakota Access pipelines, thousands and thousands of jobs, and put new buy American measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines. In other words, they build a pipeline in this country and we use the powers of the government to make that pipeline happen, we want them to use American steel. And they are willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along. Even this order was drawn, and they didn’t say that and I’m reading the order and I say why aren’t we using American steel? They said, that’s a good idea. We put it in.', 'To drain the swamp of corruption in Washington D.C., I’ve started by imposing a five-year lobbying ban on White House officials, and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government.', 'We’ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare. Obamacare is a disaster, folks. It’s a disaster. You can say, oh, Obamacare. They fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they’re not the republican people that our representatives are representing. So, we’ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back. Bring our jobs back to this country, big league.', 'It’s already happening. Big league. ', 'I’ve also worked to install a Cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats. You’ve seen what they’ve done over the last long number of years. That will be one of the great cabinets ever assembled in American history. You look at Rex Tillerson. He’s out there negotiating right now. General Mattis I mentioned before. General Kelly. We have great, great people, makers with us now. We have great people. Among their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens.', 'Now look, fair trade. Not free. Fair. If a country is taking advantage of us, we’re not going to let that happen anymore. You know, every country takes advantage of us, almost. I may be able to find a couple that don’t, but for the most part, that would be a tough job for me to do. Jobs have already started to surge. Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico, and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs. Fiat Chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan creating 2,000 new american jobs. They were with me a week ago. You know, you were here. General Motors likewise committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave, and if I didn’t get elected, believe me, they would have left, and these jobs, these things that I’m announcing would never have come here.', 'Intel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with. And that will result in at least 10,000 American jobs. Wal-mart announced it will create 10,000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives. They’ll be many, many more, many more. These are a few that we’re naming.  Other countries have been taken advantage of us for decades, decades, and decades and decades, folks, and we’re not going to let that happen anymore. Not going to let it happen.', 'And one more thing, I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our constitution. Highly respected. Should get the vote from the Democrats. You may not see that, but he’ll get there one way or another. He should get there the old fashioned way, and he should get those votes. This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country. Again, I say it, there’s never been a presidency that’s done so much in such a short period of time, and we haven’t even started the big work that starts early next week. Some very big things are going to be announced next week. So we’re just getting started. We will be giving a speech as I said in Melbourne, Florida, at 5 p.m., I hope to see you there. And with that, I just say God bless America, and let’s take some questions.', 'Mara? Mara, go ahead, you were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference.', 'Reporter: [ inaudible ]', 'Mike Flynn is a wonderful person, and I asked for resignation, he respectfully gave it. He is a man who there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who’s with us today, and I was not happy with the way that information was given. He didn’t have to do that because what he did wasn’t wrong. What he did in terms of the information he saw. What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves, in this room, were given that information. Because that was classified information that was given illegally. That’s the real problem.', 'You know, you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all, you know,  “fake news” fabricated deal to try to make up for the loss of the Democrats and the press plays right into it. In fact, I saw a couple of the people supposedly involved with all of this. They know nothing about it, never in Russia, never made a phone call, never received a phone call. It’s all fake news. It’s all fake news.', 'The nice thing is I see it starting to turn where people are now looking at the illegal — I think it’s very important — the illegal giving out classified information, and let me just tell you, it was given out so much.', 'For example, I called, as you know, Mexico. It was a very confidential classified call, but I called Mexico, and in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well that’s nice, I spoke to the president of Mexico, had a good call, all the sudden it’s out there for the world to see. It was supposed to be secret.', 'Supposed to be either confidential or classified in that case, same thing with Australia. All of the sudden, people are finding out exactly what took place. The same thing happened with respect to General Flynn. Everybody saw this.', 'And I’m saying, the first thing I thought of when I heard about it, is how does the press get this information that’s classified? How do they do it? You know why? Because it’s an illegal process, and the press should be ashamed of themselves, but more importantly, the people that gave out information to the press should be ashamed of themselves. Really a shame.', 'Trump: Yes, go ahead.', 'Reporter: Why did you keep your vice president in the dark for almost two weeks?', 'Trump: Because when I looked at the information, I said, I don’t think he did anything wrong. If anything, he did something right. He was coming into office, looked at the information, and he said, “huh, that’s fine.” That’s what they are supposed to do.', 'They are supposed to be — he just didn’t call Russia, he called, and spoke to both ways, I think, there were 30-some odd countries, just doing his job. You know, he was just doing his job.', 'The thing is he didn’t tell our vice president properly, and then he said he didn’t remember, so either way, it wasn’t very satisfactory to me. And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position, and that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision, but he didn’t tell the vice president of the United States the facts, and then he didn’t remember, and that just wasn’t acceptable to me. Yes?', 'Reporter: Since you brought up Russia, I’m looking for some clarification here. During the campaign, did anyone from your team communicate with members of the Russian government or Russian intelligence, and if so, what was the nature of the conversations?', 'Trump: Well, the failing New York Times wrote a big long front page story yesterday, and it was very much discredited, as you know. It was— it’s a joke. The people mentioned in the story, I noticed they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia.', 'They weren’t even a part, really, I mean, there was such a minor part. I had not spoken to them—I think the one person, I don’t think I’ve ever spoken to him or ever met him, and he actually said he was a very low level member of, I think, committee for a short period of time. I don’t think I ever met him.', 'Now it’s possible I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I never met him, I never talked to him ever, and he thought it was a joke. The other person said he never spoke to Russia, never received a call, looked at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera, and the other person people knew that he represented various countries, but I don’t think he represented Russia, but represented various countries. That’s what he does. People know that. That’s Mr. Manafort, by the way, a respected man, a respected man, but I think he represented the Ukraine or Ukraine government or somebody, but everybody knew that. Everybody knew that. So these people... and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia. He said that very forcefully. I saw his statement. He said it forcefully. Most of the papers do not print it because it’s not good for their stories.', 'So the three people they talked about all totally deny it, and I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I don’t have any deals in Russia.', 'President Putin called me up nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election. He called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific, but so did almost all other leaders from almost all other countries.', 'That’s the exception. Russia is fake news. Russia — this is fake news put out by the media. The real news is the fact that there are people probably from the Obama administration because they are there. We have new people going in place right now, as you know, Mike Pompeo is now taking control of the CIA, James Comey at the FBI, Dan Coates is waiting to be approved. I mean, he’s a senator, a highly respected one, and he’s still waiting to be approved. But our new people are going in.', 'Just while you’re at it, because you mentioned this, the Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New York Times story yesterday. And it talked about — you saw it, front page — so director of national intelligence just put out, acting, a statement, any suggestion that the United States intelligence community — this was just given to us — is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the president and his national security team is not true.', 'So they took this front page story out of the Wall Street Journal top, and they just wrote the story, but it’s not true.', 'I’ll tell you something. I’ll be honest. I sort of enjoy this back and forth, and I guess I have all my life, but never seen more dishonest media than frankly the political media. I thought the financial media was much better and more honest, but I will say that I never get phone calls from the media.', 'How do they write a story like that in the Wall Street Journal without asking me or how do they write a story in the New York Times put it on the front page. That was the story they wrote about the women and me, front page, big massive story. And It was nasty. And then they called, they said, we never said that. We like Mr. Trump. They called up my office. We like Mr. Trump. We never said that.', 'And it was totally — they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women. I have to tell you. Totally misrepresented. I said, give us a retraction. They never gave us a retraction, and, frankly, I then went on to other things.', 'Okay. Go ahead.', 'Reporter: Mr. President, you said today that you have biggest electoral margins since Reagan with 350 electoral votes, and, in fact, president Obama got 365 -- [Trump mumbles in response] why should America — [ Trump tries to protest in response] why should America trust you when you accuse the — [ inaudible ]', 'Trump: Actually, I’ve seen that information around. It was a substantial difference, do you agree with that?', 'Reporter: You’re the president.', 'Trump: Okay. [laughing]', 'Reporter: Can you tell us, can you determine that General Flynn never wronged you? What evidence — did you ask your transcripts [inaudible] you said you’d aggressively pursue [inaudible]', 'Trump: We are.', 'Reporter: [inaudible] review of the intelligence community — what can you tell us?', 'Trump: First of all, about that. We now have Dan Coates, hopefully soon, Mike Pompeo, and James Comey, and they are in position, so I hope that we’ll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else. The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, a very successful man, and he’s offered his services, and you know, it’s something we may take advantage of, but I don’t think we’ll need that at all because of the fact that, you know, I think that we’re going to be able to straighten it out easily on its own.', 'As far as the general is concerned, when I first heard about it, I said, huh, that doesn’t sound wrong. My counsel came, Don McGahn, White House Counsel, and he told me, and I asked him, and he can speak very well for himself. He said he doesn’t think anything is wrong. You know, really didn’t think — really what happened after that — but he didn’t think anything was done wrong. I didn’t either, because I waited a period of time and thought about it. Well, I said I don’t see, to me, he was doing the job.', 'The information was provided by, who I don’t know, Sally Yates, and I was a little surprised because I said, “Doesn’t sound like he did anything wrong there,” but he did something wrong with respect to the Vice President, and I thought it was not acceptable as far as, as far as, the actual making the call. In fact, I’ve watched various programs, and I’ve read various articles where he was just doing his job. That was very normal.', 'You know, first everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong. After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job. So, and I do — and, by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he’s a fine man. Yes, john?', 'Reporter: What will you do on the leaks? You have said twice today [inaudible]', 'Trump: I’ve actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks. Those are criminal leaks.', 'They’re put out by people either in agencies you’ll see it stopping because now we have our people in. You know, again, we don’t have our people in because we can’t them approved by the Senate. We just had Jeff Sessions approved and just as an example. So, we are looking into that very seriously. It’s a criminal act.', 'You know what I say, when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked. Cause all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment. When I was called out on Mexico, I was, honestly, I was really, really surprised.', 'But I said, you know, it doesn’t make sense. That won’t happen. But that wasn’t that important to call. It was fine. I could show it to the world, and he could show it to the world, the president, who is a very fine man, by the way, same thing with Australia.', 'I said, that’s terrible that it was leaked, but it was not that important. But then I said to myself, what happens when I’m dealing with the problem of North Korea? What happens when I’m dealing with the problems in the Middle East? Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information? Very important, very, you know, I mean, at the highest level, are you going to be reporting about that too?', 'So I don’t want classified information getting out to the public. In a way, that was almost a test, so I’m dealing with Mexico, I’m dealing with Argentina. We were dealing with this case on Mike Flynn, all the information gets put into the Washington Post and gets put into the New York Times, and I’m saying, what’s going to happen when I deal on the Middle East? What’s happening when I’m dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea?', 'We got to stop it. That’s why it’s a criminal penalty. Yes? John?', 'Reporter: Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to get you to clarify, because it’s a very important point, can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign, and on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks?', 'Trump: Well, the leaks are real. You’re the one that wrote about them and reported them. I mean the leaks are real. You know what they said. You saw it and the leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake.', 'So one thing that I felt it was very important to do, and I hope we can correct it, because there’s nobody I have more respect for— well, maybe a little bit, but than reporters, than good reporters. It’s very important to me. Especially in this position. It’s very important.', 'I don’t mind bad stories. I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it’s true and over the course of time, I’ll make mistakes, and you’ll write badly and I’m okay with it. But I’m not okay when it is fake.', 'I mean I watch CNN, and it’s so much anger, hatred, and just the hatred, I don’t watch it anymore because it’s very good — he’s saying now, it’s okay, Jim, you’ll have a chance. But I watch others too. You’re not the only one, don’t feel badly. But I think it should be straight. I think it should be, I think it should be frankly more interesting.', 'I know how good everybody’s ratings are right now, but I think it’ll actually be better. People, you have a lower approval rate than Congress — I think that’s right, I don’t know Peter is that one right? I think they have, I think I heard lower than Congress. But, honestly, the public would appreciate it. I would appreciate it.', 'I don’t mind bad stories when it’s true, but we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult. I think we’re setting a record or close to a record in the time of approval in the cabinet. Numbers are crazy. Some of them had them approved immediately. I still have a lot of people that we’re waiting for.', 'And that’s all they’re doing is delaying. You look at Schumer the mess that he’s got over there. And they have nothing going. The only thing they can do is delay. And you know, I think they would be better served by, you know, approving and making sure that they’re happy and everybody’s good.', 'And sometimes, and I know President Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way, and that’s okay. That’s fine. I think it would be much better served, John, if they just went through the process quickly. This is pure delay tactics. And they say it. And everybody understands it. Yeah, go ahead, Jim.', 'Reporter: The first part of my question is can you definitively say [inaudible]', 'Trump: I had nothing to do with it. I have nothing to do with Russia. I told you, I have no deals there. I have no anything.', 'Now, when Wikileaks — which I have nothing to do with —comes out and happens to give, they are not giving classified information. They are giving stuff, what was said in an office about Hillary cheating on the debates, which, by the way, nobody mentions.', 'Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates. Can you imagine, seriously, can you imagine if I received the questions? It would be the electric chair, okay? He should be put in the electric chair and you’d even call for the reconstitution of the death penalty, okay? Maybe not you, John. Yes, you next.', 'Reporter: Mr. President, I just want to clarify an important point, I think. Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador? Prior to your inauguration? Would you have fired him if that information hadn’t leaked out?', 'Trump: I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence. Very simple. Mike was doing his job. He was calling countries, his counterparts, so it certainly would have been okay with me if he did it. I would have directed him to do it if I thought he was not doing it. I did not direct him, but I would have directed him because that’s his job. It came out that way, and, in all fairness, I watched Dr. Charles Krauthammer the other night say, he was doing his job. And I agreed with him.', 'Since then, I’ve watched many other people say that. You know, I didn’t direct him, but I would have directed him if he did not do it, okay? Jim?', 'Reporter: Just for the record, We don’t hate you.', 'Trump: Okay.', 'Reporter: Pass that along.', 'Trump: Well, ask Jeff Zucker how he got his job.', 'Reporter: If I may follow-up on questions taking place here sir, well, not too many --', 'Trump: I don’t know which microphones to hold. You have other people and your ratings are not as good as some of the others.', 'Reporter: They are pretty good right now, actually, Mr. President.', 'Trump: Go ahead.', 'Reporter: If I may ask sir, you said earlier that WikiLeaks was revealing information about the Hillary Clinton campaign during the election cycle. You welcomed that at one campaign rally, you said you loved WikiLeaks, and in a press conference, you called on the Russians to find the missing 30,000 e-mails. I’m wondering, sir if you', 'Trump: Well, she was missing 33, and that was extended with', 'Reporter: Maybe my numbers are off', 'Trump: I did say 30, but it was higher.', 'Reporter: I’m asking, sir, it sounds you don’t have much credibility here when it comes to leaking if that is something that you encouraged in the campaign.', 'Trump: Fair question.', 'Reporter: If I may ask you --', 'Trump: Do you mind me saying something?', 'Reporter: Yes, sir.', 'Trump: So in one case, you are talking about highly classified information. In the other case, you’re talking about John Podesta saying bad things about the boss. If John Podesta said that about me and working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun. He said terrible things about her. But It was not classified information. In one case, you are talking about classified. Regardless, if you look at the RNC, we had a very strong, at my suggestion, and I give Reince great credit for this. At my suggestion, because I know something about this world, I said I want a very strong defensive mechanism.', 'I don’t want to be hacked. And we did that. And you have seen that they tried to hack us and failed.', 'The DNC did not do that. If they did it, they could not have been hacked. They were hacked. Terrible things came in. You know, the only thing I think is unfair is some of the things were so — when I heard some of those things, I picked up the papers next morning, and said, “Oh, this will be front page,” but it was not even in the papers.', 'Again, if I had that happen to me, it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or newspapers. I would have been the headline in every newspaper. I mean, think of it.', 'They gave her the questions to the debate, and she should have reported herself. Why didn’t Hillary Clinton announce that, I’m sorry, I have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall, and I feel that it’s inappropriate, and I want to turn in CNN for not doing a good job.', 'Reporter: If I may follow up on that what was asked about. You said the leaks are real, but the news is fake. I don’t understand. It seems there’s a disconnect there. If the information coming from the leaks is real, then how can the stories be fake?', 'Trump: The reporting is fake.', 'Reporter: I have to ask — yes, sir?', 'Trump: Here’s the thing. The public is — you know, they read newspapers, they see television, they watch. They don’t know if it’s true or false. Because they are not involved. I’m involved. I’ve been involved with the stuff all my life. But I’m involved. I know when you are telling the truth or when you are not.', 'I just see many, many untruthful things.

Now, if I do that, oh, I’m a bad guy, but if we could get along with Russia, that’s a positive thing.

And probably Putin said, you know, he’s sitting behind his desk saying, you know, I see what’s going on in the United States, they follow it closely. It’s going to be impossible for President Trump to ever get along with Russia because of all the pressure he’s got with this fake story. Okay? And that’s a shame.

Frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion, but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons, we have to submit the health care sooner, so well submitting health care sometime in mid-March, and after that, we’re going to come up, and we’re doing very well on tax reform, yes.', 'Reporter: Mr. President, you mentioned Russia.

117,Young Greek entrepreneurs: ‘We are unfazed’,2015-12-10T15:06:13+0000,"['  ATHENS — In a modern high-tech office, two software engineers are  busy directing an army of young engineers as they work on  upgrades for their three-year-old cloud-based recruiting software  company, Workable.com, which already has 3,500 customers in 50  countries and has attracted more than $34 million in venture  capital. ', '  It would be just another Silicon Valley success story if it  weren’t for the company’s home base: Greece, a country that is the basket case in the euro zone because of economic mismanagement,  public sector corruption and a youth unemployment rate that’s a  staggering 60 percent. The situation is so dire, suicide  rates are on the rise, and there is an exodus of talent looking  for opportunities abroad.', 'Despite the bleak outlook, there is a growing cadre of Greek  entrepreneurs determined to defy the odds and build high-tech  businesses that can thrive, providing a glimmer of hope for the  economy. These trailblazers are patriots. As the most highly  educated generation in the nation’s history, they are determined  to grow their ideas on home soil even as Greece grapples with  budget austerity, and regulatory changes that are undermining the  middle class and threatening national sovereignty.', '“The crisis has pushed people into survival mode, and they  are looking for opportunities,” according to Stavros Messinis,  CEO and founder of The Cube, a start-up incubator in  Athens. “At this point, there isn’t much for them to lose.”', '  Most are tired of an unstable political system unable to put the  country back on its feet. Since the start of the economic crisis  in 2009, Greece has lost more than 25 percent of its GDP, and  thousands of enterprises have gone bust under the pressure of a  deepening recession. This summer the country defaulted on more than $280 billion of debt, and capital controls were issued to prevent  a run on the banks. ', '  As Messinis explained, “Up until now, 70 percent of Greeks were  employed by the public sector. But that is now crumbling.  Now we need to develop a high-tech  sector that can produce value-added products and services to turn the economy around.”', '  Perhaps nowhere in the Western World are the obstacles for  entrepreneurs so difficult and complex. The lack of bank  liquidity makes it near impossible to raise bank loans. The  antiquated legal system mires new businesses in red tape. There  are 39 procedures just to register a new business entity, get  electricity turned on and get construction permits. Taxes —  including a 100 percent advanced corporate income rate — are also  onerous, while the social benefits of costs for new hires, including pension and health care, is 39  percent annually. ', 'Yet some Greek entrepreneurs are willing to deal  with the realities of a broken bureaucratic system and a sinking  public sector in order to remain in their home country. For them,  the risks are worth it, since there are few avenues left that  offer career opportunities.', '  “We are unfazed by the Greek economic crisis,” said Nikos  Moraitakis, co-founder and CEO of Workable.com. “We are building a  global high-tech business that can take root anywhere, with a  customer base that is 98 percent outside Greece in more than 50  countries. In fact, we feel we have a leg up because we can  recruit excellent engineers at very competitive costs who are  fiercely loyal employees.”', '  All of Workable.com’s engineers have at least a master’s degree from top-flight U.S. and European universities, such as Purdue University and Imperial College in London, speak  English and many other languages and are up to date on all  technical advances. Their annual salary ranges from $50,000 to  $80,000 vs. $100,000 to $150,000 in the U.S.', '  It’s not surprising that Workable.com has become the poster child  of entrepreneurial success in Greece. The company — tapping  into the $1.7 billion market for small- and medium-sized  enterprises (SMEs) — is growing at 15 percent a month and  expects to expand its workforce from 60 to 200 employees by the  end of 2016. With well-heeled backers, including 83North  (formerly Greylock IL), Balderton Capital and Openfund, young  entrepreneurs aspire to copy the company’s success formula.', '  The model is to develop a tech product or service with huge  potential for the global market, keep R&D in Greece, and  maintain financial and marketing operations in the U.S., U.K. or  other European hub, said George Tziralis, managing partner of  Openfund, a €15 million Athens-based venture fund that provided  the seed funds for the software company and was the first  venture capital fund launched in Greece in 2009. “It’s a way to  circumvent political uncertainty and economic instability. It is  the new modus operandi,” explained Tziralis, a software engineer turned  entrepreneur himself.', '  At Endeavor Greece, a start-up accelerator in the tony  Kolonaki area of Athens, managing director Haris Makryniotis sees  the same trend. “Entrepreneurs of all ages are launching  businesses in the midst of an economic crisis, and an  entrepreneurial ecosystem is slowly developing here. ... When  economies go down, risk-taking by entrepreneurs goes up.”', '  According to Endeavor statistics, there are about 600 high-tech start-ups  in Greece that have sprung up in a range of industries, from  aerospace and biotech to tourism and mobile apps. Surprisingly,  the rate of formation has not declined through the country’s debt  crisis. It has actually increased 12 times since  2010. ', '  One of the early champions of this movement is Tziralis, who  didn’t only launch the country’s first VC fund but also Greece’s  first high-tech entrepreneurial networking forum, called Open  Coffee, in 2007. Today, hundreds attend Open Coffee’s monthly  events at the Binaki Museum in Athens and in other cities across  Greece, where successful entrepreneurs give presentations about  their best practices. It’s become the epicenter of the Greek  start-up scene, where developers, investors, geeks and marketers  gather to network and share ideas.', '  To date, Openfund has invested in 20 companies, including  Workable.com and Taxibeat — a hail-a-cab smartphone app and  taxi driver marketplace that has raised $6.7 million from  international investors and has been expanding its services  across cities in Europe and Latin America. ', '“These success stories are helping to boost interest from angels  and institutional investors from abroad,” Tziralis said. “They  are now realizing that a €1 investment in a Greek start-up is  equal to a £2 investment in the U.K. and a $5 investment in Silicon Valley because of our world-class  engineers.”', '  Following his lead, there are now a handful of venture capital  funds in Greece, including Attica Ventures, First Athens, PJ Tech  Catalyst, Jeremie Funds and Odyssey Venture Partners, managing about €70 million in assets. While this is a paltry  sum by international standards — the total European market for venture capital raised €4 billion last year — it’s helping to ignite a fledgling venture capital financing market. ', '  Multinationals like Microsoft are evangelizing the benefits of  high-impact entrepreneurship in Greece. Innovation centers,  business incubators and shared work spaces have sprung up across  Athens and other Greek cities to help start-ups. Their goal: to  help defray operating costs and mentor entrepreneurs. Their  mantra: Forget about any government support, since there isn’t  any. Instead, rely on your own resources and strength.', '  At the Microsoft Innovation Center, located on Kifissias Ave. in  Maroussi — a telecom alley located outside Athens —  entrepreneurs with sound commercial ideas in software and mobile  applications are given six months to two years to launch a  start-up with Microsoft product support. “To find candidates, we  visit universities and incubators,” said Fotis Draganidis, the  general manager of the center.', '  That is becoming easier as the number of incubators proliferate.  One called Orange Grove is sponsored by the Dutch embassy, and  Dutch companies such as Heineken, KLM and Philips. Another, called Enter Grow Go  (EGG) — backed by Eurobank, the third-largest Greek lender; and Corallia, a Greek innovation cluster — is  nurturing start-ups in a host of industries. The list includes  TomoTECH, a company developing advanced cloud-based brain MRI  software that is now raising $200,000 in a seed capital round  from angel investors in the U.K. and Greece to ramp up R&D  and expand its team. ', 'Although these incubators do not offer equity capital, they  sponsor competitions to help aspiring entrepreneurs garner grants  to transform their ideas into commercial prototypes and fledgling  businesses. At Orange Grove, a quarterly event called The Squeeze  awards eight of the most promising start-ups €10,000 to €15,000 so they can work full-time on their venture.', '  Often the publicity that winners attract can lead to big and better  things. Roxane Koutsolouka, the 29-year-old founder of JoinCargo,  an online transport platform connecting small businesses with  cargo carriers, was able to attract €100,000 from an angel  investor in the U.K. after winning first place at The Squeeze  last year. The networking event attracted more than 300 investors,  entrepreneurs and international company representatives who come  to offer support services for Greek start-ups.', '  One of the most notable competitions is the Hellenic Entrepreneurship Award, which is sponsored by the  Libra Group, an international conglomerate born out of the Greek  shipping empire of the Logothetis family. Each year, a panel of  judges composed of VCs, CEOs, bankers and marketing experts  choose up to five winners based on their disruptive innovation,  job creation potential and savvy financial and management  strategy. They are given interest-free loans of up to €1 million  to help with business plan development and branding. They also  receive a marketing mentorship from a Libra executive and free  legal, accounting and IT support.', '  According to Jimmy Athanasopoulos, head of social responsibility  for the Libra Group, submissions for the award have risen from  500 in 2012 to 900 in 2015. The quality of the business plans are  also improving every year as aspiring entrepreneurs become more  trained on how to structure business plans and develop business  strategy. “The start-up community is evolving, and we are in the  early days. It takes time, but we are getting there despite all  the hurdles,” said Athanasopoulos.', '  RTSafe, a winner of a €250,000 Hellenic Entrepreneurship  Award last year, found that the coveted prize has helped them  gain international recognition and the working capital to refine  their breakthrough medical technology. The one-year-old company  makes a 3-D-printed brain and skull avatar to improve the  targeting of radiotherapy for brain cancer patients that is now  being used at clinics, hospitals and research centers in the U.S.  and Europe. These include The University of Texas Health Science Center, San  Antonio, and Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in  Philadelphia. Among its customers are Brainlab and Philips. ', '  In June it also won the MIT Enterprise Forum Greece competition and now it  is being courted by venture capitalists and angel investors who  are attracted to the mulit-billion-dollar global market for the  company’s unique technology. “Besides the money and recognition,  Libra and MIT helped us bundle a strong management team and  develop a branding and marketing strategy that laid the  foundation for our venture,” said Evangelos Pappas, a medical  physicist who is one of RTSafe’s co-founders. The company has a  pre-valuation of €12 million and it is being courted by  angel and VC investors in Europe and Boston.', '  Guidance is pivotal, since most Greek entrepreneurs are  scientists and technology geeks that lack strong business  management experience. “It is a weakness in the market,” stressed  Ion Tsakonas, CEO of PJ Tech Catalyst, a €15 million seed-stage venture capital fund that invests in information and communication technology companies (ICTs) and is backed by Piraeus Bank. “Teams are not experienced enough in  business building,” Tsakonas said. “We are seeing an organized effort now in  Greece to educate and train entrepreneurs. The question now is  how quickly all of this will trickle down.”', '  Philipp Brinkmann, the Greek founder of Travelplanet24.com, the largest  e-commerce company in Greece, sees a dramatic improvement in the  entrepreneurial talent base over the last three years. “When I  first launched my online travel booking company in 2004, it was hard to find  people with experience in online marketing and data science,” he  said. “Now there is quite a lot of talent in Greece. And we’re seeing more start-ups take off.”', '  “What the country needs is more access to capital, and a larger  venture capital industry base,” Brinkmann said, noting he had to  bootstrap his company and plow profits back into the business in  order to grow, since no other funding options were available. “If  I had access to capital, there is no telling how much faster I  could have grown my venture.” ', 'Today, Travelplanet24 employs 270  people and has annual revenues of €520 million. After  acquiring its biggest competitor, Airtickets.com, earlier this  year, it now serves 40 markets worldwide and garners 67 percent of  its revenue from Europe. ', '  Greece also needs to build bridges between the university  research community, corporations, entrepreneurial innovators and  investors, much like the collaborative infrastructure in Silicon  Valley. ', '  An early visionary who has been laying the foundation for change  is Vassilios Makios, professor emeritus of engineering at the  University of Patras and general director of the Corallia Clusters Initiative. In the late 1990s, he  realized the need for Greece to transform its public sector  economy into one focused on ICT value-added products and  services, much like Israel had done in the 1970s. “I saw how a  lack of private innovation was forcing brilliant young minds to  leave Greece to find jobs elsewhere. “It was a brain drain  threatening our country’s future,” he said.', '  So he reached out to companies like Atmel, a Silicon Valley firm  that makes flash memory chips and which is run by Greek expats,  to establish a product design center in the Greek city of Patras.  After successfully luring a handful of other high-tech  multinationals, he joined forces with two other Greeks who had  worked at Bell Labs, and the team was able to get a grant from  the EU to launch Corallia in 2008. It is the country’s first  innovation design cluster that focuses on supporting new ventures  in the microelectronics, nanotechnology, gaming and aerospace  industries and boosting cooperative research efforts among  companies of all sizes in these fields. ', '  Today, Corallia has 150 company members, of which 40 are  start-ups. The innovation cluster idea pioneered by U.S. start-up  guru Michael Porter of Harvard Business School has helped Greek  companies boost exports by 108 percent and churn out 100 patents  over the last five years. Corallia has been recognized by the EU  for excellence and is now part of the Silicon Europe Alliance.', '  “For the last 30 years, entrepreneurship was an anathema in  Greece, but that’s slowly changing,” Makios said. “We can now  support multinationals that need R&D but face talent  shortages in places like Israel and India.” ', '  The start-up supply chain is emerging in this economically  battered country. Across Greece, universities are teaching  students how to think like entrepreneurs and transform innovative  ideas into breakthrough commercial products. They are also  pairing engineering students with MBAs to forge teams capable of  developing sound business strategies to boost the odds of  start-up success.', '  At the University of Economics and Business in Athens,  Ennovation, the country’s biggest student entrepreneurial  competition, is held during Global Entrepreneurship Week in  November. At the event, around 300 teams from more than 40  universities in Greece and Cyprus pitch their big ideas, vying  for a chance to land a spot at a local incubator like the EGG,  set up residence at the Microsoft Innovation Center or get  invited to meet potential investors abroad. ', '  For a lucky few, Ennovation has been their “Golden Ticket.” Just  ask TomoTECH’s CEO Zoi Giavri. The electrical engineer won last  year and was taken to the South by Southwest Conference in  Austin, Texas, this past March, where she met potential investors  and gained perspective about the entrepreneurial mentality in the  U.S. ', '  “It’s a dream come true and a chance for a brighter future,” she  said.']"

The value of the peso makes the country so attractive.  When NAFTA was first created, the dollar could buy four pesos.  Now it can buy 20.', '  “A tweet about how the dollar-peso ration needs to be changed or  be adjusted would bring back a heck of a lot more jobs than  one-off attacks on GM, Ford or United Technologies,” Cramer said.', '  In the bigger picture, Cramer wondered if the Trump rally can really  last.', '  “One of the reasons why I think you might get a better  opportunity to buy stocks than you had today is that I sense the  Republicans may not be totally enthused about Trump’s desire to  pass corporate tax reform, deregulation and a tax holiday for the  repatriation of foreign assets,” Cramer said.', '  The actions taken by House Republicans to back down from a  measure to curb the Office of Congressional Ethics after  Trump tweeted his disapproval, suggested to Cramer that Congress’  priorities may be different than Trump’s.', '  That could be very negative for stocks.', '  Even though the Dow Jones industrial average didn’t hit  20,000 in 2016, Cramer found three stocks in the Dow that could  power higher in 2017.', '  Cramer said investors simply asked too much of stocks when they  have already skyrocketed to new highs.

It also has thousands of skilled  engineers in need of work. Many were laid off by Nokia, the  Finnish company once synonymous with mobile telephones and more  recently at risk of fading into oblivion.', '  While entrepreneurs are eager to put these people to work, the  rules of Finland’s generous social safety net effectively  discourage this. Jobless people generally cannot earn additional  income while collecting unemployment benefits or they risk losing  that assistance. For laid-off workers from Nokia, simply  collecting a guaranteed unemployment check often presents a  better financial proposition than taking a leap with a start-up  in Finland, where a shaky technology industry is trying to find  its footing again.', ' More from The New York Times:  How a Putin fan overseas pushed pro-Trump propaganda to  Americans Wonder and worry, as a Syrian child transforms Outsiders selected by Trump aim to unnerve Washington', '  Now, the Finnish government is exploring how to change that  calculus, initiating an experiment in a form of social welfare:  universal basic income. Early next year, the government plans to  randomly select roughly 2,000 unemployed people — from  white-collar coders to blue-collar construction workers. It will  give them benefits automatically, absent bureaucratic hassle and  minus penalties for amassing extra income.', '  The government is eager to see what happens next. Will more  people pursue jobs or start businesses? How many will stop  working and squander their money on vodka? Will those liberated  from the time-sucking entanglements of the unemployment system  use their freedom to gain education, setting themselves up for  promising new careers? These areas of inquiry extend beyond  economic policy, into the realm of human nature.', '  The answers — to be determined over a two-year trial —  could shape social welfare policy far beyond Nordic terrain. In  communities around the world, officials are exploring basic  income as a way to lessen the vulnerabilities of working people  exposed to the vagaries of global trade and automation. While  basic income is still an emerging idea, one far from being  deployed on a large scale, the growing experimentation  underscores the deep need to find effective means to alleviate  the perils of globalization.', '  The search has gained an extraordinary sense of urgency as a wave  of reactionary populism sweeps the globe, casting the elite  establishment as the main beneficiary of economic forces that  have hurt the working masses. Americans’ election of Donald J.  Trump, who has vowed to radically constrain trade, and the  stunning vote in Britain to abandon the European Union, have  resounded as emergency sirens for global leaders. They must  either update capitalism to share the spoils more equitably, or  risk watching angry mobs dismantle the institutions that have  underpinned economic policy since the end of World War II.', '  Universal basic income is a catchall phrase that describes a  range of proposals, but they generally share one feature: All  people in society get a regular check from the government —  regardless of their income or whether they work.

Traditional unemployment insurance schemes were  devised in an age when the cyclical nature of factory life was  dominant. Workers who were idled in lean times could pay their  bills using unemployment benefits while awaiting the inevitable  return of flush ones.', '  Universal basic income is gaining consideration in part as an  acknowledgment that the labor market has changed so fundamentally  that full employment may amount to a fantasy. Factories have been  refashioned into urban-chic office spaces. Robots are replacing  workers, while the gig economy turns full-time jobs into contract  positions.', '  Basic income is intended to be permanent, built for an age in  which demand for labor may be perpetually slack.

Liberals envision it as a  way to remove the stigma of public assistance: Instead of  standing in line at the grocery store bearing food stamps while  suffering the judgment of other shoppers — Shouldn’t she be  buying spinach instead of frozen pizza? — poor people would  get the same check as everyone else.', '  The technology world has seized on basic income as the response  to automation and its threat of joblessness. If everyone’s needs  are being met, then society can embrace robots and liberation  from drudge work.', '  Yet the expensive price tag attached to anything that is truly  universal makes it a political nonstarter in many countries  — especially in the United States, where Mr. Trump just  appointed a labor secretary who is critical of simply raising the  minimum wage.', '  If every American were to receive just $10,000 a year, the tab  would be roughly $3 trillion a year, roughly eight times what the  United States now spends on social service programs. The  government might just as well commit to handing out unicorns.', '  Beyond arithmetic, basic income confronts fundamental  disagreements about human reality. If people are released from  fears that — absent work — they risk finding themselves  sleeping outdoors, will they devolve into freeloaders?', '  “Some people think basic income will solve every problem under  the sun, and some people think it’s from the hand of Satan and  will destroy our work ethic,” says Olli Kangas, who oversees  research at Kela, a Finnish government agency that administers  many social welfare programs. “I’m hoping we can create some  knowledge on this issue.”', '  Half a millennium ago, Thomas More’s seminal novel, “Utopia,”  included the suggestion that public assistance might be a better  way to deter thieves than a death sentence.

The  libertarian economist Milton Friedman embraced a variant:  negative income taxes that would put cash in the pockets of the  poor.', '  Yet with the exception of a few experiments, basic income has  been confined to the margins of policy conversations.', '  Until now.', '  Finland’s concerns are pragmatic. The government has no interest  in freeing wage earners to write poetry.

The growth of tablets and  smartphones assailed a major industry, commercial paper  manufacturing. A crisis in neighboring Russia diminished trade.  Over the last decade, Finland’s economy has grown not at all.', '  For workers, the shock has been cushioned by a comprehensive  social welfare system. In the five years after suffering a job  loss, a Finnish family of four that is eligible for housing  assistance receives average benefits equal to 73 percent of  previous wages, according to data from the Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development. That is nearly triple the  level in the United States.', '  But the social safety net also appears to be impeding the  reinvigoration of the economy by discouraging unemployed people  from working part time.', '  “It always should be worth taking the job rather than staying  home and taking the benefits,” says Finland’s minister for social  affairs and health, Pirkko Mattila. “We have to take the risk to  do this experiment.”', '  Oulu, a city of nearly 200,000 people on the Nordic Sea, stands  as a potentially fertile testing ground.', '  In centuries past, inhabitants occupied themselves shipping  salmon and tar upriver to Russia while trying not to freeze to  death.
